"Sur le palier, Swann avait été rejoint par le maître d’hôtel qui ne se trouvait pas là au moment où il était arrivé et avait été chargé par Odette de lui dire – mais il y avait bien une heure déjà – au cas où il viendrait encore, qu’elle irait probablement prendre du chocolat chez Prévost avant de rentrer. Swann partit chez Prévost, mais à chaque pas sa voiture était arrêtée par d’autres ou par des gens qui traversaient, odieux obstacles qu’il eût été heureux de renverser si le procès-verbal de l’agent ne l’eût retardé plus encore que le passage du piéton. Il comptait le temps qu’il mettait, ajoutait quelques secondes à toutes les minutes pour être sûr de ne pas les avoir faites trop courtes, ce qui lui eût laissé croire plus grande qu’elle n’était en réalité sa chance d’arriver assez tôt et de trouver encore Odette. Et à un moment, comme un fiévreux qui vient de dormir et qui prend conscience de l’absurdité des rêvasseries qu’il ruminait sans se distinguer nettement d’elles, Swann tout d’un coup aperçut en lui l’étrangeté des pensées qu’il roulait depuis le moment où on lui avait dit chez les Verdurin qu’Odette était déjà partie, la nouveauté de la douleur au cœur dont il souffrait, mais qu’il constata seulement comme s’il venait de s’éveiller. Quoi ? toute cette agitation parce qu’il ne verrait Odette que demain, ce que précisément il avait souhaité, il y a une heure, en se rendant chez MmeVerdurin. Il fut bien obligé de constater que dans cette même voiture qui l’emmenait chez Prévost il n’était plus le même, et qu’il n’était plus seul, qu’un être nouveau était là avec lui, adhérent, amalgamé à lui, duquel il ne pourrait peut-être pas se débarrasser, avec qui il allait être obligé d’user de ménagements comme avec un maître ou avec une maladie. Et pourtant depuis un moment qu’il sentait qu’une nouvelle personne s’était ainsi ajoutée à lui, sa vie lui paraissait plus intéressante. C’est à peine s’il se disait que cette rencontre possible chez Prévost (de laquelle l’attente saccageait, dénudait à ce point les moments qui la précédaient qu’il ne trouvait plus une seule idée, un seul souvenir derrière lequel il pût faire reposer son esprit), il était probable pourtant, si elle avait lieu, qu’elle serait comme les autres, fort peu de chose. Comme chaque soir dès qu’il serait avec Odette, jetant furtivement sur son changeant visage un regard aussitôt détourné de peur qu’elle n’y vît l’avance d’un désir et ne crût plus à son désintéressement, il cesserait de pouvoir penser à elle, trop occupé à trouver des prétextes qui lui permissent de ne pas la quitter tout de suite et de s’assurer, sans avoir l’air d’y tenir, qu’il la retrouverait le lendemain chez les Verdurin : c’est-à-dire de prolonger pour l’instant et de renouveler un jour de plus la déception et la torture que lui apportait la vaine présence de cette femme qu’il approchait sans oser l’étreindre.","On the landing, Swann had been joined by the butler, who had not been there when he arrived and had been instructed by Odette to tell him – but it had been an hour already – in case he came. again, that she would probably have some chocolate at Prévost's before going home. Swann left for Prévost, but at every step his car was stopped by others or by people who were crossing, odious obstacles which he would have been happy to overturn if the report of the agent had not delayed him even more. than pedestrian crossing. He counted the time he took, added a few seconds to each minute to be sure he hadn't made them too short, which would have led him to believe that his chance of getting there was greater than in reality. early and still find Odette. And at one point, like a feverish man who has just slept and who becomes aware of the absurdity of the daydreams he was brooding over without clearly distinguishing himself from them, Swann suddenly saw in him the strangeness of the thoughts he he had been driving since the moment he had been told at the Verdurins that Odette had already left, the novelty of the pain in his heart from which he suffered, but which he only noticed as if he had just woken up. What ? all this agitation because he wouldn't see Odette until tomorrow, precisely what he had wanted an hour ago when he went to Madame Verdurin's. He was forced to realize that in the same car that took him to Prévost he was no longer the same, and that he was no longer alone, that a new being was there with him, adherent, amalgamated with him. , which he might not be able to get rid of, with whom he was going to be obliged to show consideration as with a master or with an illness. And yet for a moment that he felt that a new person had thus been added to him, his life seemed more interesting to him. He barely said to himself that this possible encounter at Prévost's (of which expectation ransacked, stripped the moments that preceded it to such an extent that he could no longer find a single idea, a single memory behind which he could to rest his mind), it was probable however, if it took place, that it would be like the others, very little. Like every evening, as soon as he was with Odette, furtively casting a glance at her changing face immediately averted for fear that she would see in it the advance of a desire and no longer believe in his disinterestedness, he would cease to be able to think. to her, too busy finding pretexts that would allow him not to leave her right away and to make sure, without seeming to care, that he would find her again the next day at the Verdurins'. that is to say, to prolong for the moment and to renew for one more day the disappointment and the torture brought to him by the vain presence of this woman whom he approached without daring to embrace her.","On the landing Swann had been approached by the butler, who was not there when he arrived and had been instructed by Odette—but this was already an hour before—to tell him, in case he should still come, that she would probably go and have some chocolate at Prévost’s31 before returning home. Swann left for Prévost’s, but at every step of the way his carriage was stopped by other carriages or by people crossing the street, loathsome obstacles that he would gladly have knocked down if the policeman and his report would not have delayed him even more than the passage of a pedestrian. He counted the time he was taking, and added a few seconds to all the minutes to be sure of not having made them too short, which would have allowed him to think the chance was greater than it really was that he would arrive early enough and still find Odette. And at one point, like a man in a fever who has just been sleeping and who becomes aware of the absurdity of the dreams he has been contemplating without clearly distinguishing himself from them, Swann suddenly perceived how alien to himself were the thoughts he had been revolving since the moment he had been told at the Verdurins’ that Odette had already left, how new the pain he was suffering in his heart, but noted it only as though he had just woken up. What? All this agitation because he would not see Odette till tomorrow, exactly what he had wanted, an hour ago, when he arrived at Mme. Verdurin ’s! He was obliged to acknowledge that in this same carriage which was taking him to Prévost’s he himself was no longer the same, and that he was no longer alone, that a new person was there with him, attached to him, amalgamated to him, one from whom he might not be able to free himself, whom he was going to have to treat with circumspection, like a master or an illness. And yet for a moment now, since he had felt a new person had been added to him in this way, his life had seemed to him more interesting. He hardly said to himself that this possible meeting at Prévost ’s, however (the expectation of which so disordered, so denuded the moments preceding it that he could no longer find a single idea, a single memory within which he could rest his mind), would probably, if it took place, be like the others, not much of anything. As on every other evening, once he was with Odette, casting on her changing face a furtive glance which he would immediately turn away for fear that she would see in it his mounting desire and no longer believe in his disinterest, he would cease to be able to think about her, too occupied with finding pretexts that would permit him not to leave her right away and to make certain, without seeming to care about it, that he would see her again the next day at the Verdurins’: that is, to prolong for the moment and to renew for yet one more day the disappointment and torment that came to him from the pointless presence of this woman whom he saw so regularly without daring to take her in his arms.","On the landing Swann had run into the Verdurins' butler, who had been somewhere else a moment earlier, when he arrived, and who had been asked by Odette to tell Swann (but that was at least an hour ago) that she would probably stop to drink a cup of chocolate at Prévost's on her way home. Swann set off at once for Prévost's, but every few yards his carriage was held up by others, or by people crossing the street, loathsome obstacles each of which he would gladly have crushed beneath his wheels, were it not that a policeman fumbling with a note-book would delay him even longer than the actual passage of the pedestrian. He counted the minutes feverishly, adding a few seconds to each so as to be quite certain that he had not given himself short measure, and so, possibly, exaggerated whatever chance there might actually be of his arriving at Prévost's in time, and of finding her still there. And then, in a moment of illumination, like a man in a fever who awakes from sleep and is conscious of the absurdity of the dream-shapes among which his mind has been wandering without any clear distinction between himself and them, Swann suddenly perceived how foreign to his nature were the thoughts which he had been revolving in his mind ever since he had heard at the Verdurins' that Odette had left, how novel the heartache from which he was suffering, but of which he was only now conscious, as though he had just woken up. What! all this disturbance simply because he would not see Odette, now, till to-morrow, exactly what he had been hoping, not an hour before, as he drove toward Mme. Verdurin's. He was obliged to admit also that now, as he sat in the same carriage and drove to Prévost's, he was no longer the same man, was no longer alone even—but that a new personality was there beside him, adhering to him, amalgamated with him, a creature from whom he might, perhaps, be unable to liberate himself, towards whom he might have to adopt some such stratagem as one uses to outwit a master or a malady. And yet, during this last moment in which he had felt that another, a fresh personality was thus conjoined with his own, life had seemed, somehow, more interesting. It was in vain that he assured himself that this possible meeting at Prévost's (the tension of waiting for which so ravished, stripped so bare the intervening moments that he could find nothing, not one idea, not one memory in his mind beneath which his troubled spirit might take shelter and repose) would probably, after all, should it take place, be much the same as all their meetings, of no great importance. As on every other evening, once he was in Odette's company, once he had begun to cast furtive glances at her changing countenance, and instantly to withdraw his eyes lest she should read in them the first symbols of desire and believe no more in his indifference, he would cease to be able even to think of her, so busy would he be in the search for pretexts which would enable him not to leave her immediately, and to assure himself, without betraying his concern, that he would find her again, next evening, at the Verdurins'; pretexts, that is to say, which would enable him to prolong for the time being, and to renew for one day more the disappointment, the torturing deception that must always come to him with the vain presence of this woman, whom he might approach, yet never dared embrace."
"– Oh ! je voulais seulement savoir si c’est depuis que je te connais. Mais ce serait si naturel, est-ce que ça se passait ici ; tu ne peux pas me dire un certain soir, que je me représente ce que je faisais ce soir-là ; tu comprends bien qu’il n’est pas possible que tu ne te rappelles pas avec qui, Odette, mon amour.","- Oh ! I just wanted to know if it's since I've known you. But it would be so natural, were it happening here; you can't tell me a certain evening, that I picture to myself what I was doing that evening; you understand very well that it is not possible that you do not remember with whom, Odette, my love.","“Oh, I only wanted to know if it had happened since I’ve known you! It would be natural enough. Did it happen here? Could you tell me which particular evening, so that I could picture what I was doing at the time? I’m sure you realize it isn’t possible that you don’t remember who it was with, Odette, my love.”","""I only wished to know whether it had been since I knew you. It's only natural. Did it happen here, ever? You can't give me any particular evening, so that I can remind myself what I was doing at the time? You understand, surely, that it's not possible that you don't remember with whom, Odette, my love."" ""But I don't know; really, I don't."
"Et si Swann lui demandait ce qu’elle entendait par là, elle lui répondait avec un peu de mépris : – Mais les endroits chics, parbleu ! Si, à ton âge, il faut t’apprendre ce que c’est que les endroits chics, que veux-tu que je te dise, moi ? par exemple, le dimanche matin, l’avenue de l’Impératrice, à cinq heures le tour du Lac, le jeudi l’Éden Théâtre, le vendredi l’Hippodrome, les bals…","And if Swann asked her what she meant by that, she replied with a little contempt: – But the chic places, parbleu! If, at your age, you have to be taught what chic places are, what do you want me to tell you? for example, on Sunday morning, the avenue de l'Impératrice, at five o'clock around the lake, on Thursday the Eden Theater, on Friday the Hippodrome, the balls...","And if Swann asked her what she meant by that, she would answer him a little scornfully: “Why, smart places! My goodness! If at your age you need to be taught what the smart places are, I don’t know what to tell you. For example, the avenue de l’Impératrice38 on Sunday mornings, the Tour du Lac39 at five o’clock, the Éden Théâtre40 on Thursdays, the Hippodrome 41 on Friday, the balls . . .”","And if Swann were to ask her what she meant by that, she would answer, with a touch of contempt, ""Smart places! Why, good heavens, just fancy, at your age, having to be told what the smart places are in Paris! What do you expect me to say? Well, on Sunday mornings there's the Avenue de l'Impératrice, and round the lake at five o'clock, and on Thursdays the Eden-Théâtre, and the Hippodrome on Fridays; then there are the balls..."""
"– Non, madame Octave.","“No, Madame Octave.","“No, Madame Octave.”","""No, Mme. Octave."""
"Même à l’heure où elle se manifestait par cette grâce, la conduite de mon père à mon égard gardait ce quelque chose d’arbitraire et d’immérité qui la caractérisait, et qui tenait à ce que généralement elle résultait plutôt de convenances fortuites que d’un plan prémédité. Peut-être même que ce que j’appelais sa sévérité, quand il m’envoyait me coucher, méritait moins ce nom que celle de ma mère ou de ma grand’mère, car sa nature, plus différente en certains points de la mienne que n’était la leur, n’avait probablement pas deviné jusqu’ici combien j’étais malheureux tous les soirs, ce que ma mère et ma grand’mère savaient bien ; mais elles m’aimaient assez pour ne pas consentir à m’épargner de la souffrance, elles voulaient m’apprendre à la dominer afin de diminuer ma sensibilité nerveuse et fortifier ma volonté. Pour mon père, dont l’affection pour moi était d’une autre sorte, je ne sais pas s’il aurait eu ce courage : pour une fois où il venait de comprendre que j’avais du chagrin, il avait dit à ma mère : « Va donc le consoler. » Maman resta cette nuit-là dans ma chambre et, comme pour ne gâter d’aucun remords ces heures si différentes de ce que j’avais eu le droit d’espérer, quand Françoise, comprenant qu’il se passait quelque chose d’extraordinaire en voyant maman assise près de moi, qui me tenait la main et me laissait pleurer sans me gronder, lui demanda : « Mais Madame, qu’a donc Monsieur à pleurer ainsi ? » maman lui répondit : « Mais il ne sait pas lui-même, Françoise, il est énervé ; préparez-moi vite le grand lit et montez vous coucher. » Ainsi, pour la première fois, ma tristesse n’était plus considérée comme une faute punissable mais comme un mal involontaire qu’on venait de reconnaître officiellement, comme un état nerveux dont je n’étais pas responsable ; j’avais le soulagement de n’avoir plus à mêler de scrupules à l’amertume de mes larmes, je pouvais pleurer sans péché. Je n’étais pas non plus médiocrement fier vis-à-vis de Françoise de ce retour des choses humaines, qui, une heure après que maman avait refusé de monter dans ma chambre et m’avait fait dédaigneusement répondre que je devrais dormir, m’élevait à la dignité de grande personne et m’avait fait atteindre tout d’un coup à une sorte de puberté du chagrin, d’émancipation des larmes.","Even at the time when it manifested itself through this grace, my father's conduct towards me retained that something arbitrary and undeserved which characterized it, and which was due to the fact that generally it resulted rather from fortuitous conveniences than of a premeditated plan. Perhaps even what I called his severity, when he sent me to bed, deserved this name less than that of my mother or my grandmother, because his nature, more different in certain points from mine than mine. was not theirs, had probably not guessed until now how unhappy I was every evening, which my mother and my grandmother knew well; but they loved me enough not to consent to spare me suffering, they wanted to teach me to dominate it in order to diminish my nervous sensitivity and strengthen my will. For my father, whose affection for me was of a different kind, I don't know if he would have had this courage: for once when he had just understood that I was sad, he had told my mother ""So go and console him. Maman stayed that night in my room and, as if to spoil with no remorse these hours so different from what I had had the right to hope for, when Françoise, realizing that something was going on Extraordinary when she saw Mama sitting next to me, who was holding my hand and letting me cry without scolding me, she asked her: ""But Madame, why is Monsieur crying like this?"" Mom replied: “But he doesn't know himself, Françoise, he's irritated; quickly prepare the big bed for me and go up to bed. Thus, for the first time, my sadness was no longer considered as a punishable fault but as an involuntary evil that had just been officially recognized, as a nervous state for which I was not responsible; I had the relief of no longer having to mingle scruples with the bitterness of my tears, I could weep without sin. Nor was I half proud of Françoise at this return to human things, who, an hour after Mama had refused to come up to my room and had me disdainfully replying that I should sleep, m elevated me to the dignity of a grown-up and had made me suddenly reach a sort of puberty from sorrow, from the emancipation of tears.","Even at the moment when it manifested itself through this pardon, my father’s conduct toward me retained that arbitrary and undeserved quality that characterized it and was due to the fact that it generally resulted from fortuitous convenience rather than a premeditated plan. It may even be that what I called his severity, when he sent me to bed, deserved that name less than my mother’s or my grandmother’s, for his nature, in certain respects more different from mine than theirs was, had probably kept him from discovering until now how very unhappy I was every evening, something my mother and my grandmother knew well; but they loved me enough not to consent to spare me my suffering, they wanted to teach me to master it in order to reduce my nervous sensitivity and strengthen my will. As for my father, whose affection for me was of another sort, I do not know if he would have been courageous enough for that: the one time he realized that I was upset, he had said to my mother: “Go and comfort him.” Mama stayed in my room that night and, as though not to allow any remorse to spoil those hours which were so different from what I had had any right to expect, when Françoise, realizing that something extraordinary was happening when she saw Mama sitting next to me, holding my hand and letting me cry without scolding me, asked her: “Why, madame, now what’s wrong with Monsieur that he’s crying so?” Mama answered her: “Why, even he doesn’t know, Françoise, he’s in a state; prepare the big bed for me quickly and then go on up to bed yourself.” And so, for the first time, my sadness was regarded no longer as a punishable offense but as an involuntary ailment that had just been officially recognized, a nervous condition for which I was not responsible; I had the relief of no longer having to mingle qualms of conscience with the bitterness of my tears, I could cry without sin. I was also not a little proud, with respect to Françoise, of this turnabout in human affairs which, an hour after Mama had refused to come up to my room and had sent the disdainful answer that I should go to sleep, raised me to the dignity of a grown-up and brought me suddenly to a sort of puberty of grief, of emancipation from tears.","Even at the moment when it manifested itself in this crowning mercy, my father's conduct towards me was still somewhat arbitrary, and regardless of my deserts, as was characteristic of him and due to the fact that his actions were generally dictated by chance expediencies rather than based on any formal plan. And perhaps even what I called his strictness, when he sent me off to bed, deserved that title less, really, than my mother's or grandmother's attitude, for his nature, which in some respects differed more than theirs from my own, had probably prevented him from guessing, until then, how wretched I was every evening, a thing which my mother and grandmother knew well; but they loved me enough to be unwilling to spare me that suffering, which they hoped to teach me to overcome, so as to reduce my nervous sensibility and to strengthen my will. As for my father, whose affection for me was of another kind, I doubt if he would have shewn so much courage, for as soon as he had grasped the fact that I was unhappy he had said to my mother: ""Go and comfort him. "" Mamma stayed all night in my room, and it seemed that she did not wish to mar by recrimination those hours, so different from anything that I had had a right to expect; for when Françoise (who guessed that something extraordinary must have happened when she saw Mamma sitting by my side, holding my hand and letting me cry unchecked) said to her: ""But, Madame, what is little Master crying for? "" she replied: ""Why, Françoise, he doesn't know himself: it is his nerves. Make up the big bed for me quickly and then go off to your own."" And thus for the first time my unhappiness was regarded no longer as a fault for which I must be punished, but as an involuntary evil which had been officially recognised a nervous condition for which I was in no way responsible: I had the consolation that I need no longer mingle apprehensive scruples with the bitterness of my tears; I could weep henceforward without sin. I felt no small degree of pride, either, in Franchise's presence at this return to humane conditions which, not an hour after Mamma had refused to come up to my room and had sent the snubbing message that I was to go to sleep, raised me to the dignity of a grown-up person, brought me of a sudden to a sort of puberty of sorrow, to emancipation from tears."
"C’est ainsi que, pendant longtemps, quand, réveillé la nuit, je me ressouvenais de Combray, je n’en revis jamais que cette sorte de pan lumineux, découpé au milieu d’indistinctes ténèbres, pareil à ceux que l’embrasement d’un feu de bengale ou quelque projection électrique éclairent et sectionnent dans un édifice dont les autres parties restent plongées dans la nuit : à la base assez large, le petit salon, la salle à manger, l’amorce de l’allée obscure par où arriverait M. Swann, l’auteur inconscient de mes tristesses, le vestibule où je m’acheminais vers la première marche de l’escalier, si cruel à monter, qui constituait à lui seul le tronc fort étroit de cette pyramide irrégulière ; et, au faîte, ma chambre à coucher avec le petit couloir à porte vitrée pour l’entrée de maman ; en un mot, toujours vu à la même heure, isolé de tout ce qu’il pouvait y avoir autour, se détachant seul sur l’obscurité, le décor strictement nécessaire (comme celui qu’on voit indiqué en tête des vieilles pièces pour les représentations en province) au drame de mon déshabillage ; comme si Combray n’avait consisté qu’en deux étages reliés par un mince escalier et comme s’il n’y avait jamais été que sept heures du soir. À vrai dire, j’aurais pu répondre à qui m’eût interrogé que Combray comprenait encore autre chose et existait à d’autres heures. Mais comme ce que je m’en serais rappelé m’eût été fourni seulement par la mémoire volontaire, la mémoire de l’intelligence, et comme les renseignements qu’elle donne sur le passé ne conservent rien de lui, je n’aurais jamais eu envie de songer à ce reste de Combray.","This is how, for a long time, when, waking up at night, I remembered Combray, I never saw anything but this kind of luminous patch, cut out in the middle of indistinct darkness, like those that the conflagration of a bengal fire or some electric projection illuminates and cuts through a building whose other parts remain immersed in the night: at the fairly wide base, the small living room, the dining room, the start of the dark alley through which would arrive M. Swann, the unconscious author of my sadness, the vestibule where I was heading towards the first step of the staircase, so cruel to climb, which constituted in itself the very narrow trunk of this irregular pyramid; and, at the top, my bedroom with the little hallway with the glass door for Mama's entrance; in a word, always seen at the same time, isolated from everything that could be around, standing out alone against the darkness, the strictly necessary decor (like the one we see indicated at the top of the old rooms for the performances in the provinces) to the drama of my undressing; as if Combray had only consisted of two stories connected by a narrow staircase and as if it had never been there before but seven o'clock in the evening. To tell the truth, I could have replied to anyone who had questioned me that Combray understood something else and existed at other times. But as what I would have remembered of it would have been furnished to me only by voluntary memory, the memory of intelligence, and as the information it gives about the past retains nothing of it, I would never have wanted to think of this remnant of Combray.","but this sort of luminous panel, cut out among indistinct shadows, like those panels which the glow of a Bengal light or some electric projection will cut out and illuminate in a building whose other parts remain plunged in darkness: at the rather broad base, the small parlor, the dining room, the opening of the dark path by which M. Swann, the unconscious author of my sufferings, would arrive, the front hall where I would head toward the first step of the staircase, so painful to climb, that formed, by itself, the very narrow trunk of this irregular pyramid; and, at the top, my bedroom with the little hallway and its glass-paned door for Mama’s entrance; in a word, always seen at the same hour, isolated from everything that might surround it, standing out alone against the darkness, the bare minimum of scenery (such as one sees prescribed at the beginnings of the old plays for performances in the provinces) needed for the drama of my undressing; as though Combray had consisted only of two floors connected by a slender staircase and as though it had always been seven o’clock in the evening there. The fact is, I could have answered anyone who asked me that Combray also included other things and existed at other times of day. But since what I recalled would have been supplied to me only by my voluntary memory, the memory of the intelligence, and since the information it gives about the past preserves nothing of the past itself, I would never have had any desire to think about the rest of Combray.","And so it was that, for a long time afterwards, when I lay awake at night and revived old memories of Combray, I saw no more of it than this sort of luminous panel, sharply defined against a vague and shadowy background, like the panels which a Bengal fire or some electric sign will illuminate and dissect from the front of a building the other parts of which remain plunged in darkness: broad enough at its base, the little parlour, the dining-room, the alluring shadows of the path along which would come M. Swann, the unconscious author of my sufferings, the hall through which I would journey to the first step of that staircase, so hard to climb, which constituted, all by itself, the tapering 'elevation' of an irregular pyramid; and, at the summit, my bedroom, with the little passage through whose glazed door Mamma would enter; in a word, seen always at the same evening hour, isolated from all its possible surroundings, detached and solitary against its shadowy background, the bare minimum of scenery necessary (like the setting one sees printed at the head of an old play, for its performance in the provinces) to the drama of my undressing, as though all Combray had consisted of but two floors joined by a slender staircase, and as though there had been no time there but seven o'clock at night. I must own that I could have assured any questioner that Combray did include other scenes and did exist at other hours than these. But since the facts which I should then have recalled would have been prompted only by an exercise of the will, by my intellectual memory, and since the pictures which that kind of memory shews us of the past preserve nothing of the past itself, I should never have had any wish to ponder over this residue of Combray."
"Mais Françoise se hâtait de rejoindre ma tante, je retournais à mon livre, les domestiques se réinstallaient devant la porte à regarder tomber la poussière et l’émotion qu’avaient soulevées les soldats. Longtemps après que l’accalmie était venue, un flot inaccoutumé de promeneurs noircissait encore les rues de Combray.","But Françoise hurried back to my aunt, I went back to my book, the servants settled down again in front of the door to watch the dust fall and the emotion that the soldiers had stirred up. Long after the lull had come, an unusual stream of walkers still darkened the streets of Combray.","But Françoise would hurry back to my aunt, I would return to my book, the servants would settle in front of the gate again to watch as the dust subsided along with the emotion roused by the soldiers. Long after calm had descended, an unaccustomed flow of people out walking would continue to darken the streets of Combray.","But Françoise would hasten back to my aunt, and I would return to my book, and the servants would take their places again outside the gate to watch the dust settle on the pavement, and the excitement caused by the passage of the soldiers subside. Long after order had been restored, an abnormal tide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of Corn-bray."
"Quand Françoise, après avoir veillé à ce que mes parents eussent tout ce qu’il leur fallait, remontait une première fois chez ma tante pour lui donner sa pepsine et lui demander ce qu’elle prendrait pour déjeuner, il était bien rare qu’il ne fallût pas donner déjà son avis ou fournir des explications sur quelque événement d’importance :","When Françoise, after seeing that my parents had everything they needed, went up to my aunt's house for the first time to give her her pepsin and ask her what she would have for lunch, it was very rare that he should not already give his opinion or provide explanations on some event of importance:","When Françoise, having seen that my parents had everything they needed, went back for the first time to give my aunt her pepsin and ask what she would like to have for lunch, it was quite rare that she was not already required to offer an opinion or provide explanations about some event of importance:","When Françoise, having seen that my parents had everything they required, first went upstairs again to give my aunt her pepsin and to find out from her what she would take for luncheon, very few mornings pased but she was called upon to give an opinion, or to furnish an explanation, in regard to some important event."
"Celui-ci était rendu plus cruel encore quand revenait à Swann le souvenir d’un bref regard qu’il avait surpris, il y avait quelques jours, et pour la première fois, dans les yeux d’Odette. C’était après dîner, chez les Verdurin. Soit que Forcheville sentant que Saniette, son beau-frère, n’était pas en faveur chez eux, eût voulu le prendre comme tête de Turc et briller devant eux à ses dépens, soit qu’il eût été irrité par un mot maladroit que celui-ci venait de lui dire, et qui, d’ailleurs, passa inaperçu pour les assistants qui ne savaient pas quelle allusion désobligeante il pouvait renfermer, bien contre le gré de celui qui le prononçait sans malice aucune, soit enfin qu’il cherchât depuis quelque temps une occasion de faire sortir de la maison quelqu’un qui le connaissait trop bien et qu’il savait trop délicat pour qu’il ne se sentît pas gêné à certains moments rien que de sa présence, Forcheville répondit à ce propos maladroit de Saniette avec une telle grossièreté, se mettant à l’insulter, s’enhardissant, au fur et à mesure qu’il vociférait, de l’effroi, de la douleur, des supplications de l’autre, que le malheureux, après avoir demandé à MmeVerdurin s’il devait rester, et n’ayant pas reçu de réponse, s’était retiré en balbutiant, les larmes aux yeux. Odette avait assisté impassible à cette scène, mais quand la porte se fut refermée sur Saniette, faisant descendre en quelque sorte de plusieurs crans l’expression habituelle de son visage, pour pouvoir se trouver dans la bassesse, de plain-pied avec Forcheville, elle avait brillanté ses prunelles d’un sourire sournois de félicitations pour l’audace qu’il avait eue, d’ironie pour celui qui en avait été victime ; elle lui avait jeté un regard de complicité dans le mal, qui voulait si bien dire : « voilà une exécution, ou je ne m’y connais pas. Avez-vous vu son air penaud, il en pleurait », que Forcheville, quand ses yeux rencontrèrent ce regard, dégrisé soudain de la colère ou de la simulation de colère dont il était encore chaud, sourit et répondit :","This was made still more cruel when Swann remembered a brief look he had caught a few days ago, and for the first time, in Odette's eyes. It was after dinner, at the Verdurins'. Either Forcheville, feeling that Saniette, his brother-in-law, was not in favor with them, would have liked to take him as the head of a Turk and shine before them at his expense, or he would have been irritated by a clumsy word like that -ci had just said to him, and which, moreover, passed unnoticed by the assistants who did not know what disparaging allusion it could contain, much against the will of the one who pronounced it without any malice, or finally that he had been looking for since some time an opportunity to get out of the house someone who knew him too well and whom he knew was too sensitive for him not to feel embarrassed at certain times just by his presence, Forcheville replied to this clumsy remark of Saniette with such rudeness, beginning to insult him, becoming emboldened, as he vociferated, with terror, pain, the pleas of the other, that the unfortunate, after having asked to Madame Verdurin if he should stay, and having received no reply, if was stammering away with tears in his eyes. Odette had watched this scene impassively, but when the door closed behind Saniette, lowering the usual expression of her face several notches, so as to be able to find herself in baseness, on the same level as Forcheville, she had shone his pupils with a sly smile of congratulations for the audacity he had had, of irony for the one who had been its victim; she had given him a look of complicity in evil, which meant so well: ""Here is an execution, or I don't know anything about it."" Did you see his sheepish look, he was crying about it”, that Forcheville, when his eyes met this gaze, suddenly sobered with anger or the simulation of anger with which he was still warm, smiled and replied:","This torture became still crueler when Swann remembered a brief expression he had surprised, a few days before, and for the first time, in Odette’s eyes. It was after dinner, at the Verdurins’. Either because Forcheville, feeling that Saniette, his brother-in-law, was not in favor in their house, wanted to use him as a whipping boy and shine in front of them at his expense, or because he had been irritated by a clumsy remark which Saniette had just made to him and which, in fact, had gone unnoticed by those present, who were not aware of the unpleasant allusion it might contain quite contrary to the intentions of the one who had uttered it without any malice, or finally because for some time now he had been looking for an opportunity to induce them to banish from the house someone who was too well acquainted with him and whom he knew to be so refined that he felt embarrassed at certain moments merely by his presence, Forcheville answered this clumsy remark of Saniette’s with such coarseness, hurling insults at him, and emboldened, as he shouted, by Saniette’s pain, his dismay, his entreaties, that the wretched man, after asking Mme. Verdurin if he ought to stay, and receiving no answer, had left the house stammering, tears in his eyes. Odette had watched this scene impassively, but when the door closed on Saniette, lowering as it were by several notches her face’s habitual expression, so as to be able to find herself, in her baseness, on an equal footing with Forcheville, she had put a sparkle in her eyes with a sly smile of congratulations for the audacity he had shown, of mockery for the man who had been its victim; she had cast him a glance of complicity in evil which was so clearly intended to say: “That finished him off, or I’m very much mistaken. Did you see how pathetic he looked? He was actually crying,” that Forcheville, when his eyes met that glance, sobering in a moment from the anger or simulation of anger which still warmed him, smiled and answered:","A fresh turn was given to the screw when Swann recalled a sudden expression which he had intercepted, a few days earlier, and for the first time, in Odette's eyes. It was after dinner at the Verdurins'. Whether it was because Forcheville, aware that Saniette, his brother-in-law, was not in favour with them, had decided to make a butt of him, and to shine at his expense, or because he had been annoyed by some awkward remark which Saniette had made to him, although it had passed unnoticed by the rest of the party who knew nothing of whatever tactless allusion it might conceal, or possibly because he had been for some time looking out for an opportunity of securing the expulsion from the house of a fellow-guest who knew rather too much about him, and whom he knew to be so nice-minded that he himself could not help feeling embarrassed at times merely by his presence in the room, Forcheville replied to Saniette's tactless utterance with such a volley of abuse, going out of his way to insult him, emboldened, the louder he shouted, by the fear, the pain, the entreaties of his victim, that the poor creature, after asking Mme. Verdurin whether he should stay and receiving no answer, had left the house in stammering confusion and with tears in his eyes. Odette had looked on, impassive, at this scene; but when the door had closed behind Saniette, she had forced the normal expression of her face down, as the saying is, by several pegs, so as to bring herself on to the same level of vulgarity as Forcheville; her eyes had sparkled with a malicious smile of congratulation upon his audacity, of ironical pity for the poor wretch who had been its victim; she had darted at him a look of complicity in the crime, which so clearly implied: ""That's finished him off, or I'm very much mistaken. Did you see what a fool he looked? He was actually crying,"" that Forcheville, when his eyes met hers, sobered in a moment from the anger, or pretended anger with which he was still flushed, smiled as he explained: ""He need only have made himself pleasant and he'd have been here still; a good scolding does a man no harm, at any time."""

"On ne pouvait pas remercier mon père ; on l’eût agacé par ce qu’il appelait des sensibleries. Je restai sans oser faire un mouvement ; il était encore devant nous, grand, dans sa robe de nuit blanche sous le cachemire de l’Inde violet et rose qu’il nouait autour de sa tête depuis qu’il avait des névralgies, avec le geste d’Abraham dans la gravure d’après Benozzo Gozzoli que m’avait donnée M. Swann, disant à Sarah qu’elle a à se départir du côté d’Isaac. Il y a bien des années de cela. La muraille de l’escalier où je vis monter le reflet de sa bougie n’existe plus depuis longtemps. En moi aussi bien des choses ont été détruites que je croyais devoir durer toujours, et de nouvelles se sont édifiées donnant naissance à des peines et à des joies nouvelles que je n’aurais pu prévoir alors, de même que les anciennes me sont devenues difficiles à comprendre. Il y a bien longtemps aussi que mon père a cessé de pouvoir dire à maman : « Va avec le petit. » La possibilité de telles heures ne renaîtra jamais pour moi. Mais depuis peu de temps, je recommence à très bien percevoir si je prête l’oreille, les sanglots que j’eus la force de contenir devant mon père et qui n’éclatèrent que quand je me retrouvai seul avec maman. En réalité ils n’ont jamais cessé ; et c’est seulement parce que la vie se tait maintenant davantage autour de moi que je les entends de nouveau, comme ces cloches de couvents que couvrent si bien les bruits de la ville pendant le jour qu’on les croirait arrêtées mais qui se remettent à sonner dans le silence du soir.","You couldn't thank my father; he would have been annoyed by what he called sentimentality.

Swann, telling Sarah that she has to part ways with Isaac. Many years ago. The wall of the staircase where I saw the reflection of her candle ascending no longer exists. In me also many things have been destroyed that I thought should last forever, and new ones have been built giving birth to new sorrows and new joys that I could not have foreseen then, just as the old ones have become difficult for me. to understand. It's also been a long time since my father stopped being able to say to Mama: ""Go with the little one."" The possibility of such hours will never reappear for me. But for a short time, I began to perceive very well again, if I listened carefully, the sobs that I had the strength to contain in front of my father and which only burst out when I found myself alone with Mum. In reality they have never ceased; and it's only because life is now quieter around me that I hear them again, like those convent bells that the noises of the city drown out so well during the day that you'd think they had stopped but are recovering to ring in the silence of the evening.","It was impossible to thank my father; he would have been irritated by what he called mawkishness.

Swann had given me, as he told Sarah she must leave Issac’s side. This was many years ago. The staircase wall on which I saw the rising glimmer of his candle has long since ceased to exist.

It was a very long time ago, too, that my father ceased to be able to say to Mama: “Go with the boy.” The possibility of such hours will never be reborn for me. But for a little while now, I have begun to hear again very clearly, if I take care to listen, the sobs that I was strong enough to contain in front of my father and that broke out only when I found myself alone again with Mama. They have never really stopped; and it is only because life is now becoming quieter around me that I can hear them again, like those convent bells covered so well by the clamor of the town during the day that one would think they had ceased altogether but which begin sounding again in the silence of the evening.","It was impossible for me to thank my father; what he called my sentimentality would have exasperated him.

Swann had given me, telling Sarah that she must tear herself away from Isaac. Many years have passed since that night. The wall of the staircase, up which I had watched the light of his candle gradually climb, was long ago demolished. And in myself, too, many things have perished which, I imagined, would last for ever, and new structures have arisen, giving birth to new sorrows and new joys which in those days I could not have foreseen, just as now the old are difficult of comprehension. It is a long time, too, since my father has been able to tell Mamma to ""Go with the child. "" Never again will such hours be possible for me. But of late I have been increasingly able to catch, if I listen attentively, the sound of the sobs which I had the strength to control in my father's presence, and which broke out only when I found myself alone with Mamma. Actually, their echo has never ceased: it is only because life is now growing more and more quiet round about me that I hear them afresh, like those convent bells which are so effectively drowned during the day by the noises of the streets that one would suppose them to have been stopped for ever, until they sound out again through the silent evening air."
"Mais ceux que faisait couramment Odette l’étaient moins et servaient à empêcher des découvertes qui auraient pu lui créer avec les uns ou avec les autres, de terribles difficultés. Aussi quand elle mentait, prise de peur, se sentant peu armée pour se défendre, incertaine du succès, elle avait envie de pleurer, par fatigue, comme certains enfants qui n’ont pas dormi. Puis elle savait que son mensonge lésait d’ordinaire gravement l’homme à qui elle le faisait, et à la merci duquel elle allait peut-être tomber si elle mentait mal. Alors elle se sentait à la fois humble et coupable devant lui. Et quand elle avait à faire un mensonge insignifiant et mondain, par association de sensations et de souvenirs, elle éprouvait le malaise d’un surmenage et le regret d’une méchanceté.","But those that Odette commonly made were less so and served to prevent discoveries that could have created terrible difficulties for her with one or the other. So when she lied, seized with fear, feeling ill-equipped to defend herself, uncertain of success, she felt like crying, out of fatigue, like some children who have not slept. Then she knew that her lie usually seriously injured the man to whom she was lying, and at whose mercy she might fall if she lied badly. So she felt both humble and guilty in front of him. And when she had to tell an insignificant and mundane lie, by association of sensations and memories, she felt the discomfort of overwork and the regret of malice.","But the lies Odette generally told were less innocent and served to prevent discoveries that might have created for her, with one person or another, terrible difficulties. And so when she lied, struck by fear, aware that she was feebly armed to defend herself, uncertain of success, she wanted to cry, from exhaustion, like certain children who have not slept. And she also knew that her lie was usually doing serious harm to the man to whom she was telling it, and into whose power she was perhaps going to fall if she lied badly. And so she felt at once humble and guilty in his presence. And when she had to tell an insignificant social lie, the association of sensations and memories would leave her with the faintness that follows overexertion and the regret that follows an act of malevolence.","But the lies which Odette ordinarily told were less innocent, and served to prevent discoveries which might have involved her in the most terrible difficulties with one or another of her friends. And so, when she lied, smitten with fear, feeling herself to be but feebly armed for her defence, unconfident of success, she was inclined to weep from sheer exhaustion, as children weep sometimes when they have not slept. She knew, also, that her lie, as a rule, was doing a serious injury to the man to whom she was telling it, and that she might find herself at his mercy if she told it badly. Therefore she felt at once humble and culpable in his presence. And when she had to tell an insignificant, social lie its hazardous associations, and the memories which it recalled, would leave her weak with a sense of exhaustion and penitent with a consciousness of wrongdoing."

Never doubting that it was done on purpose, to shew that they were not afraid of a title, she had made up her mind to imitate their arrogance, but had not quite grasped what grammatical form it ought to take. Moreover, the natural corruptness of her speech overcoming her implacable republicanism, she still said instinctively ""the de La Trémoïlles,"" or, rather (by an abbreviation sanctified by the usage of music-hall singers and the writers of the 'captions' beneath caricatures, who elide the 'de'), ""the d'La Trémoïlles,"" but she corrected herself at once to ""Madame La Trémoïlle.—The Duchess, as Swann calls her,"" she added ironically, with a smile which proved that she was merely quoting, and would not, herself, accept the least responsibility for a classification so puerile and absurd."
"Je n’osai pas accepter, mais posai à Swann des questions sur Bergotte. « Est-ce que vous pourriez me dire quel est l’acteur qu’il préfère ? »","I dared not accept, but asked Swann some questions about Bergotte. “Could you tell me which actor he prefers? »","I did not dare accept his offer, but asked Swann some questions about Bergotte. “Could you tell me which is his favorite actor?” “Actor?","I dared not accept such an offer, but bombarded Swann with questions about his friend. ""Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?"" ""Actor?"
"Quant à Napoléon III, c’est à Forcheville que quelque vague association d’idées, puis une certaine modification dans la physionomie habituelle du baron, enfin le grand cordon de la Légion d’honneur en sautoir, lui avaient fait donner ce nom ; mais en réalité, et pour tout ce que le personnage présent dans le rêve lui représentait et lui rappelait, c’était bien Forcheville. Car d’images incomplètes et changeantes Swann endormi tirait des déductions fausses, ayant d’ailleurs momentanément un tel pouvoir créateur qu’il se reproduisait par simple division comme certains organismes inférieurs ; avec la chaleur sentie de sa propre paume il modelait le creux d’une main étrangère qu’il croyait serrer, et de sentiments et d’impressions dont il n’avait pas conscience encore, faisait naître comme des péripéties qui, par leur enchaînement logique, amèneraient à point nommé dans le sommeil de Swann le personnage nécessaire pour recevoir son amour ou provoquer son réveil. Une nuit noire se fit tout d’un coup, un tocsin sonna, des habitants passèrent en courant, se sauvant des maisons en flammes ; Swann entendait le bruit des vagues qui sautaient et son cœur qui, avec la même violence, battait d’anxiété dans sa poitrine. Tout d’un coup ses palpitations de cœur redoublèrent de vitesse, il éprouva une souffrance, une nausée inexplicables ; un paysan couvert de brûlures lui jetait en passant : « Venez demander à Charlus où Odette est allée finir la soirée avec son camarade, il a été avec elle autrefois et elle lui dit tout. C’est eux qui ont mis le feu. » C’était son valet de chambre qui venait l’éveiller et lui disait : – Monsieur, il est huit heures et le coiffeur est là, je lui ai dit de repasser dans une heure.","As for Napoleon III, it was at Forcheville that some vague association of ideas, then a certain modification in the usual physiognomy of the baron, finally the grand cordon of the Legion of Honor in saltire, had caused him to be given this name; but in reality, and for all that the character present in the dream represented and reminded him of, it was indeed Forcheville. For from incomplete and changing images Swann asleep drew false deductions, having moreover momentarily such creative power that he reproduced himself by simple division like certain lower organisms; with the felt warmth of his own palm he modeled the hollow of a foreign hand which he thought he was shaking, and of feelings and impressions of which he was not yet aware, gave rise as it were to adventures which, by their logical sequence , would bring at the right time into Swann's sleep the character necessary to receive his love or bring about his awakening. A black night fell suddenly, a tocsin sounded, inhabitants ran past, fleeing from the burning houses; Swann heard the sound of the crashing waves and his heart which, with the same violence, beat with anxiety in his chest. Suddenly his heart palpitations redoubled in speed, he felt inexplicable pain and nausea; a peasant covered in burns threw at her in passing: ""Come and ask Charlus where Odette went to finish the evening with her comrade, he was with her once and she tells him everything."" They are the ones who set the fire. It was his valet who came to wake him up and said to him: “Monsieur, it’s eight o’clock and the hairdresser is here, I told him to come back in an hour.","As for Napoleon III, it was to Forcheville that some vague association of ideas, then a certain modification in the Baron’s usual physiognomy, lastly the broad ribbon of the Legion of Honor on his chest, had induced him to give this name; but in reality, and in everything which the character in the dream represented to him and recalled to him, it was indeed Forcheville. For, from incomplete and changing images the sleeping Swann drew false deductions, having for the moment as well such creative power that he reproduced himself by simple division like certain lower organisms; with the warmth that he felt in his own palm he modeled the hollow of a strange hand which he thought he was clasping, and from feelings and impressions of which he was not yet conscious, devised peripeteias of a sort which, through their logical linking, would produce at just the right moment in Swann’s sleep the person required to receive his love or prompt his awakening. Utter darkness descended on him in an instant, an alarm sounded, inhabitants of the place ran past, escaping from houses in flames; Swann heard the sound of the waves leaping and his heart, with the same violence, pounding with anxiety in his chest. Suddenly the palpitations of his heart redoubled in speed, he felt an inexplicable pain and nausea; a countryman covered with burns flung at him as he passed: “Come ask Charlus where Odette ended up this evening with her friend, he used to go about with her in the old days and she tells him everything. It’s them that started the fire.” It was his valet who had come to wake him and who said: “Monsieur, it’s eight o’clock and the hairdresser is here, I’ve told him to come by again in an hour.”","As for Napoleon III, it was to Forcheville that some vague association of ideas, then a certain modification of the Baron's usual physiognomy, and lastly the broad ribbon of the Legion of Honour across his breast, had made Swann give that name; but actually, and in everything that the person who appeared in his dream represented and recalled to him, it was indeed Forcheville. For, from an incomplete and changing set of images, Swann in his sleep drew false deductions, enjoying, at the same time, such creative power that he was able to reproduce himself by a simple act of division, like certain lower organisms; with the warmth that he felt in his own palm he modelled the hollow of a strange hand which he thought that he was clasping, and out of feelings and impressions of which he was not yet conscious, he brought about sudden vicissitudes which, by a chain of logical sequences, would produce, at definite points in his dream, the person required to receive his love or to startle him awake. In an instant night grew black about him; an alarum rang, the inhabitants ran past him, escaping from their blazing houses; he could hear the thunder of the surging waves, and also of his own heart, which, with equal violence, was anxiously beating in his breast. Suddenly the speed of these palpitations redoubled, he felt a pain, a nausea that were inexplicable; a peasant, dreadfully burned, flung at him as he passed: ""Come and ask Charlus where Odette spent the night with her friend. He used to go about with her, and she tells him everything. It was they that started the fire. "" It was his valet, come to awaken him, and saying:— ""Sir, it is eight o'clock, and the barber is here. I have told him to call again in an hour."""

"de frayer. S’il en connaissait d’autres, c’étaient relations de jeune homme sur lesquelles des amis anciens de sa famille, comme étaient mes parents, fermaient d’autant plus bienveillamment les yeux qu’il continuait, depuis qu’il était orphelin, à venir très fidèlement nous voir ; mais il y avait fort à parier que ces gens inconnus de nous qu’il voyait, étaient de ceux qu’il n’aurait pas osé saluer si, étant avec nous, il les avait rencontrés. Si l’on avait voulu à toute force appliquer à Swann un coefficient social qui lui fût personnel, entre les autres fils d’agents de situation égale à celle de ses parents, ce coefficient eût été pour lui un peu inférieur parce que, très simple de façons et ayant toujours eu une « toquade » d’objets anciens et de peinture, il demeurait maintenant dans un vieil hôtel où il entassait ses collections et que ma grand’mère rêvait de visiter, mais qui était situé quai d’Orléans, quartier que ma grand’tante trouvait infamant d’habiter. « Êtes-vous seulement connaisseur ? Je vous demande cela dans votre intérêt, parce que vous devez vous faire repasser des croûtes par les marchands », lui disait ma grand’tante ; elle ne lui supposait en effet aucune compétence et n’avait pas haute idée, même au point de vue intellectuel, d’un homme qui dans la conversation, évitait les sujets sérieux et montrait une précision fort prosaïque, non seulement quand il nous donnait, en entrant dans les moindres détails, des recettes de cuisine, mais même quand les sœurs de ma grand’mère parlaient de sujets artistiques.","to spawn. If he knew others, they were young man's relations to which old friends of his family, like my parents, closed their eyes all the more benevolently as he continued, since he was an orphan, to come very faithfully to see us; but it was a safe bet that these people unknown to us whom he saw were those whom he would not have dared to greet if, being with us, he had met them. If we had wanted at all costs to apply to Swann a social coefficient that was personal to him, among the other sons of agents in a situation equal to that of his parents, this coefficient would have been for him a little lower because, very simply ways and having always had a ""fad"" for old objects and paintings, he now lived in an old hotel where he piled up his collections and which my grandmother dreamed of visiting, but which was located on the Quai d'Orléans, in the that my great-aunt found infamous to live in. “Are you only knowledgeable? I ask you this in your interest, because you have to have the scabs ironed out by the merchants,” said my great-aunt to her; she did not in fact suppose him to have any competence and did not have a high idea, even from an intellectual point of view, of a man who in conversation avoided serious subjects and showed a very prosaic precision, not only when he gave us, going into the smallest details, cooking recipes, but even when my grandmother's sisters talked about artistic subjects.","One knew which had been his father’s associations, one therefore knew which were his own, with which people he was “in a position” to consort. If he knew others, these were bachelor acquaintances on whom old friends of the family, such as my relatives, would close their eyes all the more benignly because he continued, after losing his parents, to come faithfully to see us; but we would have been ready to wager that these people he saw, who were unknown to us, were the sort he would not have dared greet had he encountered them when he was with us. If you were determined to assign Swann a social coefficient that was his alone, among the other sons of stockbrokers in a position equal to that of his parents, this coefficient would have been a little lower for him because, very simple in his manner and with a long-standing “craze” for antiques and painting, he now lived and amassed his collections in an old town house which my grandmother dreamed of visiting, but which was situated on the quai d’Orléans, a part of town where my great-aunt felt it was ignominious to live. “But are you a connoisseur? I ask for your own sake, because you’re likely to let the dealers unload some awful daubs on you,” my great-aunt would say to him; in fact she did not assume he had any competence and even from an intellectual point of view had no great opinion of a man who in conversation avoided serious subjects and showed a most prosaic preciseness not only when he gave us cooking recipes, entering into the smallest details, but even when my grandmother’s sisters talked about artistic subjects.","We knew the people with whom his father had associated, and so we knew his own associates, the people with whom he was 'in a position to mix.' If he knew other people besides, those were youthful acquaintances on whom the old friends of the family, like my relatives, shut their eyes all the more good-naturedly that Swann himself, after he was left an orphan, still came most faithfully to see us; but we would have been ready to wager that the people outside our acquaintance whom Swann knew were of the sort to whom he would not have dared to raise his hat, had he met them while he was walking with ourselves. Had there been such a thing as a determination to apply to Swann a social coefficient peculiar to himself, as distinct from all the other sons of other stockbrokers in his father's position, his coefficient would have been rather lower than theirs, because, leading a very simple life, and having always had a craze for 'antiques' and pictures, he now lived and piled up his collections in an old house which my grandmother longed to visit, but which stood on the Quai d'Orléans, a neighbourhood in which my great-aunt thought it most degrading to be quartered. ""Are you really a connoisseur, now?"" she would say to him; ""I ask for your own sake, as you are likely to have 'fakes' palmed off on you by the dealers,"" for she did not, in fact, endow him with any critical faculty, and had no great opinion of the intelligence of a man who, in conversation, would avoid serious topics and shewed a very dull preciseness, not only when he gave us kitchen recipes, going into the most minute details, but even when my grandmother's sisters were talking to him about art."
"mais : « Nous ne pourrons pas nous voir demain soir, il y a un souper chez les Verdurin. » Ou bien les Verdurin devaient l’emmener à l’Opéra-Comique voir « Une nuit de Cléopâtre » et Swann lisait dans les yeux d’Odette cet effroi qu’il lui demandât de n’y pas aller, que naguère il n’aurait pu se retenir de baiser au passage sur le visage de sa maîtresse, et qui maintenant l’exaspérait. « Ce n’est pas de la colère, pourtant, se disait-il à lui-même, que j’éprouve en voyant l’envie qu’elle a d’aller picorer dans cette musique stercoraire. C’est du chagrin, non pas certes pour moi, mais pour elle ; du chagrin de voir qu’après avoir vécu plus de six mois en contact quotidien avec moi, elle n’a pas su devenir assez une autre pour éliminer spontanément Victor Massé ! Surtout pour ne pas être arrivée à comprendre qu’il y a des soirs où un être d’une essence un peu délicate doit savoir renoncer à un plaisir, quand on le lui demande. Elle devrait savoir dire « je n’irai pas », ne fût-ce que par intelligence, puisque c’est sur sa réponse qu’on classera une fois pour toutes sa qualité d’âme. » Et s’étant persuadé à lui-même que c’était seulement en effet pour pouvoir porter un jugement plus favorable sur la valeur spirituelle d’Odette qu’il désirait que ce soir-là elle restât avec lui au lieu d’aller à l’Opéra-Comique, il lui tenait le même raisonnement, au même degré d’insincérité qu’à soi-même, et même, à un degré de plus, car alors il obéissait aussi au désir de la prendre par l’amour-propre.","but: ""We won't be able to see each other to-morrow evening, there's a supper at the Verdurins'."" Or else the Verdurins were to take her to the Opéra-Comique to see ""A Night of Cleopatra"" and Swann read in Odette's eyes the terror that he asked her not to go, that he had not could have refrained from kissing his mistress's face in passing, which now exasperated him. “It is not anger, however, he said to himself, that I feel when I see the desire she has to go and peck in this stercorary music. It is sorrow, certainly not for me, but for her; sorrow to see that after having lived more than six months in daily contact with me, she has not been able to become enough of another to spontaneously eliminate Victor Massé! Especially for not being able to understand that there are evenings when a being of a somewhat delicate essence must know how to give up a pleasure, when asked to do so. She should know how to say “I will not go”, if only by intelligence, since it is on her answer that we will classify her quality of soul once and for all. And having persuaded himself that it was in fact only in order to be able to pass a more favorable judgment on the spiritual value of Odette that he wanted her to stay with him that evening instead of going to the Opéra-Comique, he had the same reasoning for her, with the same degree of insincerity as for himself, and even, to a greater degree, because then he was also obeying the desire to take her by love- own.","but: “We won’t be able to see each other tomorrow night , there’s a supper at the Verdurins’.” Or else the Verdurins were to take her to the Opéra-Comique to see Une Nuit de Cléopatre75 and Swann would read in Odette’s eyes a fear that he would ask her not to go, which once upon a time he would not have been able to keep himself from kissing as it passed over his mistress’s face, and which now exasperated him. “It’s not anger, however,” he said to himself, “that I feel when I see that she wants to go and scratch about in that excremental music. It’s sorrow, not for myself certainly, but for her; sorrow at seeing that after more than six months of living in daily contact with me, she has not managed to change enough to eliminate Victor Massé spontaneously! Especially for not having come to understand that there are evenings when a person of any subtlety must know how to give up a pleasure, when one asks it of her. She ought to know how to say ‘I won’t go,’ if only by using her intelligence, since it is on the basis of her answer that one will rate once and for all the quality of her soul.” And having persuaded himself that it really was only in order to be able to pass a more favorable judgment on Odette’s spiritual value that he wanted her to stay with him that evening instead of going to the Opéra-Comique, he presented her with the same reasoning, with the same degree of insincerity as he had presented it to himself, and even with one degree more, for now he was also responding to a desire to capture her through her self-love.","but ""We sha'n't be able to meet to-morrow evening; there's a supper-party at the Verdurins'. "" Or else the Verdurins were taking her to the Opéra-Comique, to see Une Nuit de Cléopâtre, and Swann could read in her eyes that terror lest he should ask her not to go, which, but a little time before, he could not have refrained from greeting with a kiss as it flitted across the face of his mistress, but which now exasperated him. "" Yet I'm not really angry,"" he assured himself, ""when I see how she longs to run away and scratch from maggots in that dunghill of cacophony. I'm disappointed; not for myself, but for her; disappointed to find that, after living for more than six months in daily contact with myself, she has not been capable of improving her mind even to the point of spontaneously eradicating from it a taste for Victor Massé! More than that, to find that she has not arrived at the stage of understanding that there are evenings on which anyone with the least shade of refinement of feeling should be willing to forego an amusement when she is asked to do so. She ought to have the sense to say: 'I shall not go,' if it were only from policy, since it is by what she answers now that the quality of her soul will be determined once and for all."" And having persuaded himself that it was solely, after all, in order that he might arrive at a favourable estimate of Odette's spiritual worth that he wished her to stay at home with him that evening instead of going to the Opéra-Comique, he adopted the same line of reasoning with her, with the same degree of insincerity as he had used with himself, or even with a degree more, for in her case he was yielding also to the desire to capture her by her own self-esteem."

"Il y avait déjà bien des années que, de Combray, tout ce qui n’était pas le théâtre et la drame de mon coucher n’existait plus pour moi, quand un jour d’hiver, comme je rentrais à la maison, ma mère, voyant que j’avais froid, me proposa de me faire prendre, contre mon habitude, un peu de thé. Je refusai d’abord et, je ne sais pourquoi, me ravisai. Elle envoya chercher un de ces gâteaux courts et dodus appelés Petites Madeleines qui semblent avoir été moulés dans la valve rainurée d’une coquille de Saint-Jacques. Et bientôt, machinalement, accablé par la morne journée et la perspective d’un triste lendemain, je portai à mes lèvres une cuillerée du thé où j’avais laissé s’amollir un morceau de madeleine. Mais à l’instant même où la gorgée mêlée des miettes du gâteau toucha mon palais, je tressaillis, attentif à ce qui se passait d’extraordinaire en moi. Un plaisir délicieux m’avait envahi, isolé, sans la notion de sa cause. Il m’avait aussitôt rendu les vicissitudes de la vie indifférentes, ses désastres inoffensifs, sa brièveté illusoire, de la même façon qu’opère l’amour, en me remplissant d’une essence précieuse : ou plutôt cette essence n’était pas en moi, elle était moi. J’avais cessé de me sentir médiocre, contingent, mortel. D’où avait pu me venir cette puissante joie ? Je sentais qu’elle était liée au goût du thé et du gâteau, mais qu’elle le dépassait infiniment, ne devait pas être de même nature. D’où venait-elle ? Que signifiait-elle ? Où l’appréhender ? Je bois une seconde gorgée où je ne trouve rien de plus que dans la première, une troisième qui m’apporte un peu moins que la seconde. Il est temps que je m’arrête, la vertu du breuvage semble diminuer. Il est clair que la vérité que je cherche n’est pas en lui, mais en moi. Il l’y a éveillée, mais ne la connaît pas, et ne peut que répéter indéfiniment, avec de moins en moins de force, ce même témoignage que je ne sais pas interpréter et que je veux au moins pouvoir lui redemander et retrouver intact à ma disposition, tout à l’heure, pour un éclaircissement décisif. Je pose la tasse et me tourne vers mon esprit. C’est à lui de trouver la vérité. Mais comment ?","It had already been many years since, from Combray, everything that was not the theater and the drama of my going to bed no longer existed for me, when one winter day, as I was returning home, my mother , seeing that I was cold, offered to make me take, against my habit, a little tea. I refused at first and, I don't know why, changed my mind. She sent for one of those short, plump cakes called Petites Madeleines that look like they've been molded in the grooved valve of a scallop shell. And soon, mechanically, overwhelmed by the dismal day and the prospect of a sad tomorrow, I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had left a piece of madeleine to soften. But at the very moment when the sip mixed with the crumbs of the cake touched my palate, I started, attentive to what was extraordinary happening in me. A delicious pleasure had invaded me, isolated, without the notion of its cause. He had immediately made the vicissitudes of life indifferent to me, its inoffensive disasters, its illusory brevity, in the same way that love operates, by filling me with a precious essence: or rather this essence was not in me, she was me. I had ceased to feel mediocre, contingent, mortal. Where could this powerful joy have come from? I felt that it was linked to the taste of tea and cake, but that it exceeded it infinitely, should not be of the same nature. Where did she come from? What did she mean? Where to apprehend it? I drink a second sip where I find nothing more than in the first, a third which brings me a little less than the second. It's time for me to stop, the virtue of the drink seems to be diminishing. It is clear that the truth I seek is not in him, but in me. He has awakened her there, but does not know her, and can only repeat indefinitely, with less and less force, this same testimony which I do not know how to interpret and which I want at least to be able to ask her again and find intact again. my disposal, presently, for a decisive clarification. I put the cup down and turn to my mind. It's up to him to find the truth. But how ?","For many years, already, everything about Combray that was not the theater and drama of my bedtime had ceased to exist for me, when one day in winter, as I returned home, my mother, seeing that I was cold, suggested that, contrary to my habit, I have a little tea. I refused at first and then, I do not know why, changed my mind. She sent for one of those squat, plump cakes called petites madeleines that look as though they have been molded in the grooved valve of a scallop shell. And soon, mechanically, oppressed by the gloomy day and the prospect of another sad day to follow, I carried to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had let soften a bit of madeleine. But at the very instant when the mouthful of tea mixed with cake crumbs touched my palate, I quivered, attentive to the extraordinary thing that was happening inside me. A delicious pleasure had invaded me, isolated me, without my having any notion as to its cause. It had immediately rendered the vicissitudes of life unimportant to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory, acting in the same way that love acts, by filling me with a precious essence: or rather this essence was not merely inside me, it was me. I had ceased to feel mediocre, contingent, mortal. Where could it have come to me from—this powerful joy? I sensed that it was connected to the taste of the tea and the cake, but that it went infinitely far beyond it, could not be of the same nature. Where did it come from? What did it mean? How could I grasp it? I drink a second mouthful, in which I find nothing more than in the first, a third that gives me a little less than the second. It is time for me to stop, the virtue of the drink seems to be diminishing. Clearly, the truth I am seeking is not in the drink, but in me. The drink has awoken it in me, but does not know this truth, and can do no more than repeat indefinitely, with less and less force, this same testimony which I do not know how to interpret and which I want at least to be able to ask of it again and find again, intact, available to me, soon, for a decisive clarification. I put down the cup and turn to my mind. It is up to my mind to find the truth. But how?","Many years had elapsed during which nothing of Combray, save what was comprised in the theatre and the drama of my going to bed there, had any existence for me, when one day in winter, as I came home, my mother, seeing that I was cold, offered me some tea, a thing I did not ordinarily take. I declined at first, and then, for no particular reason, changed my mind. She sent out for one of those short, plump little cakes called 'petites madeleines,' which look as though they had been moulded in the fluted scallop of a pilgrim's shell. And soon, mechanically, weary after a dull day with the prospect of a depressing morrow, I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had soaked a morsel of the cake. No sooner had the warm liquid, and the crumbs with it, touched my palate than a shudder ran through my whole body, and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary changes that were taking place. An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, but individual, detached, with no suggestion of its origin. And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory— this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has of filling me with a precious essence; or rather this essence was not in me, it was myself. I had ceased now to feel mediocre, accidental, mortal. Whence could it have come to me, this all-powerful joy? I was conscious that it was connected with the taste of tea and cake, but that it infinitely transcended those savours, could not, indeed, be of the same nature as theirs. Whence did it come? What did it signify? How could I seize upon and define it? I drink a second mouthful, in which I find nothing more than in the first, a third, which gives me rather less than the second. It is time to stop; the potion is losing its magic. It is plain that the object of my quest, the truth, lies not in the cup but in myself. The tea has called up in me, but does not itself understand, and can only repeat indefinitely with a gradual loss of strength, the same testimony; which I, too, cannot interpret, though I hope at least to be able to call upon the tea for it again and to find it there presently, intact and at my disposal, for my final enlightenment. I put down my cup and examine my own mind. It is for it to discover the truth. But how?"
"Et tout d’un coup le souvenir m’est apparu. Ce goût, c’était celui du petit morceau de madeleine que le dimanche matin à Combray (parce que ce jour-là je ne sortais pas avant l’heure de la messe), quand j’allais lui dire bonjour dans sa chambre, ma tante Léonie m’offrait après l’avoir trempé dans son infusion de thé ou de tilleul. La vue de la petite madeleine ne m’avait rien rappelé avant que je n’y eusse goûté ; peut-être parce que, en ayant souvent aperçu depuis, sans en manger, sur les tablettes des pâtissiers, leur image avait quitté ces jours de Combray pour se lier à d’autres plus récents ; peut-être parce que, de ces souvenirs abandonnés si longtemps hors de la mémoire, rien ne survivait, tout s’était désagrégé ; les formes – et celle aussi du petit coquillage de pâtisserie, si grassement sensuel sous son plissage sévère et dévot – s’étaient abolies, ou, ensommeillées, avaient perdu la force d’expansion qui leur eût permis de rejoindre la conscience. Mais, quand d’un passé ancien rien ne subsiste, après la mort des êtres, après la destruction des choses, seules, plus frêles mais plus vivaces, plus immatérielles, plus persistantes, plus fidèles, l’odeur et la saveur restent encore longtemps, comme des âmes, à se rappeler, à attendre, à espérer, sur la ruine de tout le reste, à porter sans fléchir, sur leur gouttelette presque impalpable, l’édifice immense du souvenir.","And suddenly the memory dawned on me. This taste was that of the little piece of madeleine that on Sunday mornings at Combray (because that day I didn't go out before mass time), when I went to say hello to him in his room, my Aunt Leonie offered it to me after having dipped it in her infusion of tea or lime blossom. The sight of the little madeleine had reminded me of nothing before I had tasted it; perhaps because, having often seen them since, without eating them, on the shelves of pastry chefs, their image had left those days of Combray to be linked to other more recent ones; perhaps because, of these memories abandoned for so long outside memory, nothing survived, everything had disintegrated; the forms – and also that of the little pastry shell, so richly sensual under its severe and devout pleating – had been abolished, or, drowsy, had lost the force of expansion which would have allowed them to rejoin consciousness. But, when from an ancient past nothing remains, after the death of beings, after the destruction of things, alone, more frail but more lively, more immaterial, more persistent, more faithful, the smell and the flavor remain for a long time yet. , like souls, to remember, to wait, to hope, on the ruin of all the rest, to carry without flinching, on their almost impalpable droplet, the immense edifice of memory.","And suddenly the memory appeared. That taste was the taste of the little piece of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because that day I did not go out before it was time for Mass), when I went to say good morning to her in her bedroom, my aunt Léonie would give me after dipping it in her infusion of tea or lime blossom. The sight of the little madeleine had not reminded me of anything before I tasted it; perhaps because I had often seen them since, without eating them, on the shelves of the pastry shops, and their image had therefore left those days of Combray and attached itself to others more recent; perhaps because of these recollections abandoned so long outside my memory, nothing survived, everything had come apart; the forms and the form, too, of the little shell made of cake, so fatly sensual within its severe and pious pleating—had been destroyed, or, still half asleep, had lost the force of expansion that would have allowed them to rejoin my consciousness. But, when nothing subsists of an old past, after the death of people, after the destruction of things, alone, frailer but more enduring, more immaterial, more persistent, more faithful, smell and taste still remain for a long time, like souls, remembering, waiting, hoping, upon the ruins of all the rest, bearing without giving way, on their almost impalpable droplet, the immense edifice of memory.","And suddenly the memory returns. The taste was that of the little crumb of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those mornings I did not go out before church-time) , when I went to say good day to her in her bedroom, my aunt Léonie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of real or of lime-flower tea. The sight of the little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it; perhaps because I had so often seen such things in the interval, without tasting them, on the trays in pastry-cooks' windows, that their image had dissociated itself from those Combray days to take its place among others more recent; perhaps because of those memories, so long abandoned and put out of mind, nothing now survived, everything was scattered; the forms of things, including that of the little scallop-shell of pastry, so richly sensual under its severe, religious folds, were either obliterated or had been so long dormant as to have lost the power of expansion which would have allowed them to resume their place in my consciousness. But when from a long-distant past nothing subsists, after the people are dead, after the things are broken and scattered, still, alone, more fragile, but with more vitality, more unsubstantial, more persistent, more faithful, the smell and taste of things remain poised a long time, like souls, ready to remind us, waiting and hoping for their moment, amid the ruins of all the rest; and bear unfaltering, in the tiny and almost impalpable drop of their essence, the vast structure of recollection."

"« Elle », il essayait de se demander ce que c’était ; car c’est une ressemblance de l’amour et de la mort, plutôt que celles, si vagues, que l’on redit toujours, de nous faire interroger plus avant, dans la peur que sa réalité se dérobe, le mystère de la personnalité. Et cette maladie qu’était l’amour de Swann avait tellement multiplié, il était si étroitement mêlé à toutes les habitudes de Swann, à tous ses actes, à sa pensée, à sa santé, à son sommeil, à sa vie, même à ce qu’il désirait pour après sa mort, il ne faisait tellement plus qu’un avec lui, qu’on n’aurait pas pu l’arracher de lui sans le détruire lui-même à peu près tout entier : comme on dit en chirurgie, son amour n’était plus opérable.","“She,” he tried to figure out what it was; for it is a resemblance of love and death, rather than those, so vague, which are always repeated, to make us question further, in fear that its reality slips away, the mystery of the personality . And this disease that was Swann's love had multiplied so much, it was so closely mingled with all of Swann's habits, with all of his acts, with his thought, with his health, with his sleep, with his life, even with what he desired for after his death, he was so much more than one with him, that one could not have torn it from him without destroying him himself almost entirely: as we say in surgery, his love was no longer operable.","“She”—he tried to ask himself what that was; for one thing love and death have in common, more than those vague resemblances people are always talking about, is that they make us question more deeply, for fear that its reality will slip away from us, the mystery of personality. And this disease which was Swann’s love had so proliferated, was so closely entangled with all his habits, with all his actions, with his thoughts, his health, his sleep, his life, even with what he wanted after his death, it was now so much a part of him, that it could not have been torn from him without destroying him almost entirely: as they say in surgery, his love was no longer operable.","She?""—he tried to ask himself what that meant; for it is something like love, like death (rather than like those vague conceptions of maladies), a thing which one repeatedly calls in question, in order to make oneself probe further into it, in the fear that the question will find no answer, that the substance will escape our grasp—the mystery of personality. And this malady, which was Swann's love, had so far multiplied, was so closely interwoven with all his habits, with all his actions, with his thoughts, his health, his sleep, his life, even with what he hoped for after his death, was so entirely one with him that it would have been impossible to wrest it away without almost entirely destroying him; as surgeons say, his case was past operation."
"Une seconde visite qu’il lui fit eut plus d’importance peut-être. En se rendant chez elle ce jour-là comme chaque fois qu’il devait la voir, d’avance il se la représentait ; et la nécessité où il était pour trouver jolie sa figure de limiter aux seules pommettes roses et fraîches, les joues qu’elle avait si souvent jaunes, languissantes, parfois piquées de petits points rouges, l’affligeait comme une preuve que l’idéal est inaccessible et le bonheur médiocre. Il lui apportait une gravure qu’elle désirait voir. Elle était un peu souffrante ; elle le reçut en peignoir de crêpe de Chine mauve, ramenant sur sa poitrine, comme un manteau, une étoffe richement brodée. Debout à côté de lui, laissant couler le long de ses joues ses cheveux qu’elle avait dénoués, fléchissant une jambe dans une attitude légèrement dansante pour pouvoir se pencher sans fatigue vers la gravure qu’elle regardait, en inclinant la tête, de ses grands yeux, si fatigués et maussades quand elle ne s’animait pas, elle frappa Swann par sa ressemblance avec cette figure de Zéphora, la fille de Jéthro, qu’on voit dans une fresque de la chapelle Sixtine. Swann avait toujours eu ce goût particulier d’aimer à retrouver dans la peinture des maîtres non pas seulement les caractères généraux de la réalité qui nous entoure, mais ce qui semble au contraire le moins susceptible de généralité, les traits individuels des visages que nous connaissons : ainsi, dans la matière d’un buste du doge Loredan par Antoine Rizzo, la saillie des pommettes, l’obliquité des sourcils, enfin la ressemblance criante de son cocher Rémi ; sous les couleurs d’un Ghirlandajo, le nez de M.","A second visit he paid her was perhaps more important. On going to her house that day, as he always had to see her, he pictured her to himself in advance; and the necessity in which he felt, in order to find her face pretty, to limit only to the pink and fresh cheekbones, the cheeks which she had so often yellow, languid, sometimes dotted with little red dots, afflicted him as proof that the ideal is inaccessible and mediocre happiness. He brought her an engraving that she wanted to see. She was a little unwell; she received him in a peignoir of mauve crepe de chine, bringing over his chest, like a coat, a richly embroidered stuff. Standing next to him, letting her loose hair flow down her cheeks, bending one leg in a slightly dancing attitude to be able to lean without fatigue towards the engraving she was looking at, tilting her head, from her large eyes, so tired and sullen when she was not moving, she struck Swann by her resemblance to that figure of Zephora, Jethro's daughter, which one sees in a fresco in the Sistine Chapel. Swann had always had this particular taste for liking to find in the painting of the masters not only the general characteristics of the reality that surrounds us, but what seems on the contrary the least susceptible to generality, the individual features of the faces that we know : thus, in the material of a bust of the Doge Loredan by Antoine Rizzo, the protrusion of the cheekbones, the obliqueness of the eyebrows, finally the glaring resemblance of his coachman Rémi; under the colors of a Ghirlandajo, the nose of Mr.","A second visit he made to her was perhaps more important. Going to her house that day, as always when he was to see her, he pictured her to himself beforehand; and his need, if he was to find her face pretty, to limit what he imagined of her cheeks only to her fresh, pink cheekbones since the rest was so often yellow, languid, sometimes marked with little red specks, distressed him, as it seemed to prove that the ideal is inaccessible and happiness mediocre. He had brought her an engraving that she wanted to see. She was a little unwell; she received him in a mauve crepe de chine dressing gown, pulling the richly embroidered material over her chest like a cloak. Standing next to him, allowing her hair, which she had undone, to flow down her cheeks, bending one leg somewhat in the position of a dancer so that without getting tired she could lean over the engraving, which she looked at, inclining her head, with those large eyes of hers, so tired and sullen when she was not animated, she struck Swann by her resemblance to the figure of Zipporah, Jethro’s daughter, in a fresco in the Sistine Chapel.25 Swann had always had this peculiar penchant for amusing himself by rediscovering in the paintings of the masters not only the general characteristics of the real world that surrounds us, but what seems on the contrary the least susceptible to generalization, the individual features of the faces we know: for instance, in the material of a bust of the Doge Loredano by Antonio Rizzo,26 the jut of the cheekbones, the slant of the eyebrows, altogether the very evident resemblance to his coachman Rémi; under the colors of a Ghirlandaio,27 M. de Palancy’s nose; in a portrait by Tintoretto,28 the invasion of the cheek’s fat by the first implanted hairs of the side-whiskers, the break in the nose, the penetration of the gaze, the congestion of the eyelids of Dr. du Boulbon.","More important, perhaps, was a second visit which he paid her, a little later. On his way to the house, as always when he knew that they were to meet, he formed a picture of her in his mind; and the necessity, if he was to find any beauty in her face, of fixing his eyes on the fresh and rosy protuberance of her cheekbones, and of shutting out all the rest of those cheeks which were so often languorous and sallow, except when they were punctuated with little fiery spots, plunged him in acute depression, as proving that one's ideal is always unattainable, and one's actual happiness mediocre. He was taking her an engraving which she had asked to see. She was not very well; she received him, wearing a wrapper of mauve crêpe de Chine, which draped her bosom, like a mantle, with a richly embroidered web. As she stood there beside him, brushing his cheek with the loosened tresses of her hair, bending one knee in what was almost a dancer's pose, so that she could lean without tiring herself over the picture, at which she was gazing, with bended head, out of those great eyes, which seemed so weary and so sullen when there was nothing to animate her, Swann was struck by her resemblance to the figure of Zipporah, Jethro's Daughter, which is to be seen in one of the Sixtine frescoes. He had always found a peculiar fascination in tracing in the paintings of the Old Masters, not merely the general characteristics of the people whom he encountered in his daily life, but rather what seems least susceptible of generalisation, the individual features of men and women whom he knew, as, for instance, in a bust of the Doge Loredan by Antonio Rizzo, the prominent cheekbones, the slanting eyebrows, in short, a speaking likeness to his own coachman Rémi; in the colouring of a Ghirlandaio, the nose of M. de Palancy; in a portrait by Tintoretto, the invasion of the plumpness of the cheek by an outcrop of whisker, the broken nose, the penetrating stare, the swollen eyelids of Dr. du Boulbon."
"Je dois pourtant confesser que je me trouve assez sotte, car, dans tous les salons où je vais en visite, on ne parle naturellement que de cette malheureuse salade japonaise. On commence même à en être un peu fatigué, ajouta-t-elle en voyant que Swann n’avait pas l’air aussi intéressé qu’elle aurait cru par une si brûlante actualité.","I must, however, confess that I consider myself quite stupid, for in all the salons I go to visit, of course, nothing but this unfortunate Japanese salad is spoken of. We are even beginning to be a little tired of it, she added, seeing that Swann did not seem as interested as she would have thought in such burning news.","Yet I must confess I find I’m a bit embarrassed, for in every drawing room I visit , naturally the only thing they’re talking about is that wretched Japanese salad. One even begins to be a little tired of it,” she added, seeing that Swann did not seem as interested as she would have thought in so burning a topic.","But I do feel such a fool about it, I must confess, for, whenever I pay a call anywhere, I find everybody talking—it's only natural—about that wretched Japanese salad. Really and truly, one's beginning to get just a little tired of hearing about it ,"" she went on, seeing that Swann seemed less interested than she had hoped in so burning a topic."
"– Oui, madame, répondit Odette.","“Yes, madam,” replied Odette.","“Yes, madame,” answered Odette. “What?","""Yes, Mme. Verdurin,"" said Odette meekly. ""What!"
"Réservons-nous pour ce qui est possible ; c’est inutile de s’user à proposer des choses inacceptables et refusées d’avance. » Et ce devoir qui incombait à Odette d’aller à l’Hippodrome et devant lequel Swann s’inclinait ainsi ne lui paraissait pas seulement inéluctable ; mais ce caractère de nécessité dont il était empreint semblait rendre plausible et légitime tout ce qui de près ou de loin se rapportait à lui. Si Odette dans la rue ayant reçu d’un passant un salut qui avait éveillé la jalousie de Swann, elle répondait aux questions de celui-ci en rattachant l’existence de l’inconnu à un des deux ou trois grands devoirs dont elle lui parlait, si, par exemple, elle disait : « C’est un monsieur qui était dans la loge de mon amie avec qui je vais à l’Hippodrome », cette explication calmait les soupçons de Swann, qui en effet trouvait inévitable que l’amie eût d’autre invités qu’Odette dans sa loge à l’Hippodrome, mais n’avait jamais cherché ou réussi à se les figurer. Ah !","Let us reserve ourselves for what is possible; it is useless to get used to proposing things that are unacceptable and refused in advance. And this duty incumbent on Odette to go to the Hippodrome and before which Swann bowed thus did not only seem to him inescapable; but this character of necessity with which he was imbued seemed to make plausible and legitimate everything that closely or remotely related to him. If Odette in the street having received a greeting from a passer-by which had aroused Swann's jealousy, she answered his questions by linking the existence of the stranger to one of the two or three great duties of which she spoke to him. , if, for example, she said: ""It's a gentleman who was in my friend's dressing room with whom I'm going to the Hippodrome"", this explanation allayed Swann's suspicions, who indeed found it inevitable that the friend had invited other guests than Odette to her box at the Hippodrome, but had never tried or succeeded in imagining them. Ah!","We must confine ourselves to what’s possible; it’s pointless wearing oneself out proposing things that are unacceptable and have already been refused in advance.” And the duty incumbent upon Odette of going to the Hippodrome, to which Swann thus yielded, did not appear to him merely unavoidable; but the mark of necessity with which it was stamped seemed to make plausible and legitimate everything that was closely or distantly related to it. If, after a man passing in the street had greeted Odette and aroused Swann’s jealousy, she answered his questions by associating the stranger with one of the two or three paramount duties of which she had spoken to him, if, for example, she said: “That was a gentleman who was in the box of the friend with whom I go to the Hippodrome,” this explanation would calm Swann’s suspicions, since he did indeed find it inevitable that the friend would have other guests besides Odette in her box at the Hippodrome, but had never tried or managed to picture them. Ah!","We must confine ourselves to what is possible; no use wasting our time in proposing things that can't be accepted and are declined in advance."" And this duty that was incumbent upon Odette, of going to the Hippodrome, to which Swann thus gave way, seemed to him to be not merely ineluctable in itself; but the mark of necessity which stamped it seemed to make plausible and legitimate everything that was even remotely connected with it. If, when Odette, in the street, had acknowledged the salute of a passer-by, which had aroused Swann's jealousy, she replied to his questions by associating the stranger with any of the two or three paramount duties of which she had often spoken to him; if, for instance, she said: ""That's a gentleman who was in my friend's box the other day; the one I go to the Hippodrome with,"" that explanation would set Swann's suspicions at rest; it was, after all, inevitable that this friend should have other guests than Odette in her box at the Hippodrome, but he had never sought to form or succeeded in forming any coherent impression of them. Oh!"
"avril au 29 et arriver à Florence dès le matin de Pâques », les fit sortir toutes deux non plus seulement de l’Espace abstrait, mais de ce Temps imaginaire où nous situons non pas un seul voyage à la fois, mais d’autres, simultanés et sans trop d’émotion puisqu’ils ne sont que possibles – ce Temps qui se refabrique si bien qu’on peut encore le passer dans une ville après qu’on l’a passé dans une autre – et leur consacra de ces jours particuliers qui sont le certificat d’authenticité des objets auxquels on les emploie, car ces jours uniques, ils se consument par l’usage, ils ne reviennent pas, on ne peut plus les vivre ici quand on les a vécus là ; je sentis que c’était vers la semaine qui commençait le lundi où la blanchisseuse devait rapporter le gilet blanc que j’avais couvert d’encre, que se dirigeaient pour s’y absorber au sortir du temps idéal où elles n’existaient pas encore, les deux cités Reines dont j’allais avoir, par la plus émouvante des géométries, à inscrire les dômes et les tours dans le plan de ma propre vie. Mais je n’étais encore qu’en chemin vers le dernier degré de l’allégresse ; je l’atteignis enfin (ayant seulement alors la révélation que sur les rues clapotantes, rougies du reflet des fresques de Giorgione, ce n’était pas, comme j’avais, malgré tant d’avertissements, continué à l’imaginer, les hommes « majestueux et terribles comme la mer, portant leur armure aux reflets de bronze sous les plis de leur manteau sanglant »","April to the 29th and arrive in Florence on Easter morning"", brought them both out not only from abstract Space, but from this imaginary Time where we place not only one journey at a time, but others, simultaneous and without too much emotion since they are only possible – this Time which remakes itself so well that it can still be spent in one city after it has been spent in another – and dedicated these days to them individuals who are the certificate of authenticity of the objects to which they are used, because these unique days, they are consumed by use, they do not come back, we can no longer live them here when we have lived them there; I felt that it was towards the week that began on Monday when the laundress had to bring back the white vest that I had covered in ink, that were heading to absorb themselves in it at the end of the ideal time when they did not yet exist , the two Queen cities whose domes and towers I was going to have, by the most moving of geometries, inscribe in the plan of my own life. But I was still only on the way to the last degree of joy; I finally reached it (only then having the revelation that on the choppy streets, reddened with the reflection of Giorgione's frescoes, it was not, as I had, despite so many warnings, continued to imagine, the men ""Majestic and terrible as the sea, wearing their armor with bronze reflections under the folds of their bloody mantle""","those two Queen Cities the domes and towers of which I was soon going to be able, by the most moving kind of geometry, to inscribe on the map of my own life.

But I was still on the way, only, to the supreme pinnacle of happiness; I reached it finally (for not until then did the revelation burst upon me that on the clattering streets, reddened by the light reflected from Giorgione's frescoes, it was not, as I had, despite so many promptings, continued to imagine, the men ""majestic and terrible as the sea, bearing armour that gleamed with bronze beneath the folds of their blood-red cloaks,"" who would be walking in Venice next week, on the Easter vigil; but that I myself might be the minute personage whom, in an enlarged photograph of St. Mark's that had been lent to me, the operator had portrayed, in a bowler hat, in front of the portico), when I heard my father say: ""It must be pretty cold, still, on the Grand Canal; whatever you do, don't forget to pack your winter greatcoat and your thick suit."

À la garde ! » ou, si c’était le patient lui-même déjà arrivé qu’il avait forcé à son insu, par un interrogatoire dissimulé, à confesser ses origines, alors, pour nous montrer qu’il n’avait plus aucun doute, il se contentait de nous regarder en fredonnant imperceptiblement :","And after skillfully asking us a few more specific questions, he exclaimed: “Watch out! On guard! or, if it was the patient himself who had already arrived whom he had unknowingly forced, by a concealed interrogation, to confess his origins, then, to show us that he no longer had any doubts, he just stared at us, humming imperceptibly:","And after adroitly asking us a few more specific questions, he would cry out: “On guard! On guard!” or, if it was the victim himself, already there, whom he had forced, by a subtle interrogation, unwittingly to confess his origins, then, to show us he no longer had any doubts, he would simply gaze at us while barely perceptibly humming: Let you now guide","and then, after a few adroit questions on points of detail, he would call out ""On guard! on guard,"" or, if it were the victim himself who had already arrived, and had been obliged, unconsciously, by my grandfather's subtle examination, to admit his origin, then my grandfather, to shew us that he had no longer any doubts, would merely look at us, humming almost inaudibly the air of"
"Dans la chambre voisine, j’entendais ma tante qui causait toute seule à mi-voix. Elle ne parlait jamais qu’assez bas parce qu’elle croyait avoir dans la tête quelque chose de cassé et de flottant qu’elle eût déplacé en parlant trop fort, mais elle ne restait jamais longtemps, même seule, sans dire quelque chose, parce qu’elle croyait que c’était salutaire pour sa gorge et qu’en empêchant le sang de s’y arrêter, cela rendrait moins fréquents les étouffements et les angoisses dont elle souffrait ; puis, dans l’inertie absolue où elle vivait, elle prêtait à ses moindres sensations une importance extraordinaire ; elle les douait d’une motilité qui lui rendait difficile de les garder pour elle, et à défaut de confident à qui les communiquer, elle se les annonçait à elle-même, en un perpétuel monologue qui était sa seule forme d’activité. Malheureusement, ayant pris l’habitude de penser tout haut, elle ne faisait pas toujours attention à ce qu’il n’y eût personne dans la chambre voisine, et je l’entendais souvent se dire à elle-même : « Il faut que je me rappelle bien que je n’ai pas dormi » (car ne jamais dormir était sa grande prétention dont notre langage à tous gardait le respect et la trace : le matin Françoise ne venait pas « l’éveiller », mais « entrait » chez elle ; quand ma tante voulait faire un somme dans la journée, on disait qu’elle voulait « réfléchir » ou « reposer » ; et quand il lui arrivait de s’oublier en causant jusqu’à dire : « ce qui m’a réveillée »","In the next room I heard my aunt talking to herself in a low voice. She never spoke more than quite softly because she thought there was something broken and floating in her head which she would have displaced by speaking too loudly, but she never remained long, even alone, without saying something, because that she believed that it was beneficial for her throat and that by preventing the blood from stopping there, it would make less frequent the chokings and the anguishes from which she suffered; then, in the absolute inertia in which she lived, she lent an extraordinary importance to her slightest sensations; she endowed them with a motility which made it difficult for her to keep them to herself, and in the absence of a confidant to whom to communicate them, she announced them to herself, in a perpetual monologue which was her only form of activity. Unfortunately, having taken the habit of thinking aloud, she did not always pay attention that there was no one in the next room, and I often heard her say to herself: ""I must I remember well that I didn't sleep"" (for never to sleep was her great pretension which our language to all kept the respect and the trace: in the morning Françoise did not come ""to wake her up"", but ""entered"" at her; when my aunt wanted to take a nap during the day, it was said that she wanted to ""think"" or ""rest""; and when she happened to forget herself while chatting to the point of saying: ""what woke me »","In the next room, I would hear my aunt talking all alone in an undertone. She always talked rather softly because she thought there was something broken and floating in her head that she would have displaced by speaking too loudly, but she never remained for long, even alone, without saying something, because she believed it was beneficial to her throat and that if she prevented the blood from stopping there, she would reduce the frequency of the fits of breathlessness and the spasms from which she suffered; besides, in the absolute inertia in which she lived, she attributed to the least of her sensations an extraordinary importance; she endowed them with a mobility that made it difficult for her to keep them to herself, and lacking a confidant to whom she could communicate them , she announced them to herself, in a perpetual monologue that was her only form of activity. Unfortunately, having acquired the habit of thinking out loud, she did not always take care to see that there was no one in the next room, and I often heard her saying to herself: “I must be sure to remember that I did not sleep” (for never sleeping was her great claim, and the language we all used deferred to it and was marked by it : in the morning Françoise did not come to “wake” her, but “entered” her room;","In the next room I could hear my aunt talking quietly to herself. She never spoke save in low tones, because she believed that there was something broken in her head and floating loose there, which she might displace by talking too loud; but she never remained for long, even when alone, without saying something, because she believed that it was good for her throat, and that by keeping the blood there in circulation it would make less frequent the chokings and other pains to which she was liable; besides, in the life of complete inertia which she led she attached to the least of her sensations an extraordinary importance, endowed them with a Protean ubiquity which made it difficult for her to keep them secret, and, failing a confidant to whom she might communicate them, she used to promulgate them to herself in an unceasing monologue which was her sole form of activity. Unfortunately, having formed the habit of thinking aloud, she did not always take care to see that there was no one in the adjoining room, and I would often hear her saying to herself: "" I must not forget that I never slept a wink""—for ""never sleeping a wink"" was her great claim to distinction, and one admitted and respected in our household vocabulary; in the morning Françoise would not 'call' her, but would simply 'come to' her; during the day, when my aunt wished to take a nap, we used to say just that she wished to 'be quiet' or to 'rest'; and when in conversation she so far forgot herself as to say ""what made me wake up,"" or ""I dreamed that,"" she would flush and at once correct herself."
"Il faut avouer pourtant que cela donne quelquefois prétexte à des idées assez amusantes. Ainsi j’ai une de mes amies qui est très originale, quoique très jolie femme, très entourée, très lancée, et qui prétend qu’elle a fait faire chez elle cette salade japonaise, mais en faisant mettre tout ce qu’Alexandre Dumas fils dit dans la pièce. Elle avait invité quelques amies à venir en manger.","It must be admitted, however, that this sometimes gives rise to rather amusing ideas. So I have one of my friends who is very original, although a very pretty woman, very surrounded, very outgoing, and who claims that she had this Japanese salad made at home, but by having everything that Alexandre Dumas fils said in the room. She had invited some friends over to eat some.","“I must admit, though, that it sometimes provides an excuse for some rather amusing notions. For instance, I have a friend who’s most original, though she’s a very pretty woman, very popular, very sought after, who claims she got her cook to make that Japanese salad at her house, putting in everything that Alexandre Dumas fils mentions in the play. She invited some friends to come and eat it.","""I must admit, though, that it's sometimes quite amusing, the way they joke about it: I've got a friend, now, who is most original, though she's really a beautiful woman, most popular in society, goes everywhere, and she tells me that she got her cook to make one of these Japanese salads, putting in everything that young M. Dumas says you're to put in, in the play. Then she asked just a few friends to come and taste it."
"Et c’était aussi l’heure. Dans les endroits où les arbres gardaient encore leurs feuilles, ils semblaient subir une altération de leur matière à partir du point où ils étaient touchés par la lumière du soleil, presque horizontale le matin, comme elle le redeviendrait quelques heures plus tard au moment où dans le crépuscule commençant, elle s’allume comme une lampe, projette à distance sur le feuillage un reflet artificiel et chaud, et fait flamber les suprêmes feuilles d’un arbre qui reste le candélabre incombustible et terne de son faîte incendié. Ici, elle épaississait comme des briques, et, comme une jaune maçonnerie persane à dessins bleus, cimentait grossièrement contre le ciel les feuilles des marronniers, là au contraire les détachait de lui, vers qui elles crispaient leurs doigts d’or. À mi-hauteur d’un arbre habillé de vigne vierge, elle greffait et faisait épanouir, impossible à discerner nettement dans l’éblouissement, un immense bouquet comme de fleurs rouges, peut-être une variété d’œillet. Les différentes parties du Bois, mieux confondues l’été dans l’épaisseur et la monotonie des verdures, se trouvaient dégagées. Des espaces plus éclaircis laissaient voir l’entrée de presque toutes, ou bien un feuillage somptueux la désignait comme une oriflamme. On distinguait, comme sur une carte en couleur, Armenonville, le Pré Catelan, Madrid, le Champ de courses, les bords du Lac. Par moments apparaissait quelque construction inutile, une fausse grotte, un moulin à qui les arbres en s’écartant faisaient place ou qu’une pelouse portait en avant sur sa moelleuse plate-forme. On sentait que le Bois n’était pas qu’un bois, qu’il répondait à une destination étrangère à la vie de ses arbres, l’exaltation que j’éprouvais n’était pas causée que par l’admiration de l’automne, mais par un désir. Grande source d’une joie que l’âme ressent d’abord sans en reconnaître la cause, sans comprendre que rien au dehors ne la motive. Ainsi regardais-je les arbres avec une tendresse insatisfaite qui les dépassait et se portait à mon insu vers ce chef-d’œuvre des belles promeneuses qu’ils enferment chaque jour pendant quelques heures. J’allais vers l’allée des Acacias. Je traversais des futaies où la lumière du matin, qui leur imposait des divisions nouvelles, émondait les arbres, mariait ensemble les tiges diverses et composait des bouquets. Elle attirait adroitement à elle deux arbres ; s’aidant du ciseau puissant du rayon et de l’ombre, elle retranchait à chacun une moitié de son tronc et de ses branches, et, tressant ensemble les deux moitiés qui restaient, en faisait soit un seul pilier d’ombre, que délimitait l’ensoleillement d’alentour, soit un seul fantôme de clarté dont un réseau d’ombre noire cernait le factice et tremblant contour. Quand un rayon de soleil dorait les plus hautes branches, elles semblaient, trempées d’une humidité étincelante, émerger seules de l’atmosphère liquide et couleur d’émeraude, où la futaie tout entière était plongée comme sous la mer. Car les arbres continuaient à vivre de leur vie propre et, quand ils n’avaient plus de feuilles, elle brillait mieux sur le fourreau de velours vert qui enveloppait leurs troncs ou dans l’émail blanc des sphères de gui qui étaient semées au faîte des peupliers, rondes comme le soleil et la lune dans la Création de Michel-Ange. Mais forcés depuis tant d’années par une sorte de greffe à vivre en commun avec la femme, ils m’évoquaient la dryade, la belle mondaine rapide et colorée qu’au passage ils couvrent de leurs branches et obligent à ressentir comme eux la puissance de la saison ; ils me rappelaient le temps heureux de ma croyante jeunesse, quand je venais avidement aux lieux où des chefs-d’œuvre d’élégance féminine se réaliseraient pour quelques instants entre les feuillages inconscients et complices. Mais la beauté que faisaient désirer les sapins et les acacias du bois de Boulogne, plus troublants en cela que les marronniers et les lilas de Trianon que j’allais voir, n’était pas fixée en dehors de moi dans les souvenirs d’une époque historique, dans des œuvres d’art, dans un petit temple à l’amour au pied duquel s’amoncellent les feuilles palmées d’or. Je rejoignis les bords du Lac, j’allai jusqu’au Tir aux pigeons.","And it was also time. In the places where the trees still kept their leaves, they seemed to undergo an alteration of their material from the point where they were hit by the sunlight, almost horizontal in the morning, as it would become again a few hours later when in as dusk begins, it lights up like a lamp, projects an artificial and warm reflection on the foliage from a distance, and sets the supreme leaves of a tree on fire, which remains the incombustible and dull candelabra of its burning crown. Here it thickened like bricks, and, like yellow Persian masonry with blue patterns, roughly cemented the leaves of the chestnut trees against the sky, there, on the contrary, detached them from it, towards which they clenched their golden fingers. Halfway up a tree clad in Virginia creeper, she grafted and caused to blossom, impossible to discern clearly in the glare, an immense bouquet as of red flowers, perhaps a variety of carnation. The different parts of the Bois, better blended together in summer in the thickness and monotony of the greenery, were freed. Brighter spaces showed the entrance of almost all of them, or else sumptuous foliage designated it like a banner. We could make out, as if on a color map, Armenonville, the Pré Catelan, Madrid, the Racecourse, the shores of the lake. At times some useless construction appeared, a false grotto, a mill for which the trees, as they parted, gave way, or which a lawn carried forward on its soft platform. We felt that the Bois was not just a wood, that it responded to a destination foreign to the life of its trees, the exaltation that I felt was not caused only by the admiration of autumn , but by a desire. Great source of a joy that the soul feels at first without recognizing its cause, without understanding that nothing outside motivates it. So I looked at the trees with an unsatisfied tenderness that went beyond them and unwittingly led me towards this masterpiece of the beautiful walkers they enclose for a few hours every day. I was going towards the Allée des Acacias. I crossed forests where the morning light, which imposed new divisions on them, pruned the trees, married together the various stems and composed bouquets. She deftly drew two trees to her; using the powerful chisel of ray and shadow, she cut off from each one half of its trunk and its branches, and, braiding together the two remaining halves, made of it either a single pillar of shadow, which delimited the surrounding sunshine, a single phantom of light whose artificial and trembling outline was surrounded by a network of black shadows. When a ray of sun gilded the highest branches, they seemed, drenched in a sparkling humidity, to emerge alone from the liquid and emerald-colored atmosphere, where the whole forest was plunged as if under the sea. to live their own lives and, when they had no more leaves, it shone better on the green velvet sheath which enveloped their trunks or in the white enamel of the spheres of mistletoe which were sown on the tops of the poplars, round as the sun and the moon in Michelangelo's Creation. But forced for so many years by a kind of graft to live in common with the woman, they reminded me of the dryad, the beautiful fast and colorful socialite whom in passing they cover with their branches and force to feel like them the power of the season ; they reminded me of the happy days of my faithful youth, when I eagerly came to places where masterpieces of feminine elegance would be realized for a few moments among the oblivious and complicit foliage. But the beauty that the fir trees and acacias of the Bois de Boulogne made desire, more disturbing in this than the chestnut trees and the lilacs of Trianon that I was going to see, was not fixed outside me in the memories of an era. history, in works of art, in a small temple to love at the foot of which are heaped up palmate leaves of gold. I joined the shores of the lake, I went as far as the Tir aux pigeons.","And it was the hour, as well. In the places where the trees still kept their leaves, they seemed to be undergoing a change in substance starting from the point where they were touched by the light of the sun, almost horizontal in the morning as it would be again a few hours later at the moment when in the early twilight it flames up like a lamp, projects over a distance onto the foliage a warm and artificial glow, and sets ablaze the topmost leaves of a tree that remains the dull and incombustible candelabrum of its burning tip. Here, it thickened the leaves of the chestnut trees like bricks and, like a piece of yellow Persian masonry patterned in blue, crudely cemented them against the sky, there on the contrary detached them from it as they clutched at it with their fingers of gold. Halfway up a tree clothed in Japanese ivy, it had grafted and brought into bloom, too dazzling to discern clearly, an immense bouquet as though of red flowers, perhaps a variety of carnation. The different parts of the Bois, merging more completely in summer in the thickness and monotony of their green, were now separated. Open spaces made visible the entrance to almost every one of them, or a sumptuous bit of foliage marked it like a banner. One could distinguish, as on a colored map, Armenonville, the Pré Catelan, Madrid, the Race Course, the shores of the lake. From time to time there would appear some useless construction, a fake grotto, a mill for which the trees parted to make room or which a lawn carried forward on its soft platform. One sensed that the Bois was not merely a wood, that it fulfilled a purpose foreign to the life of its trees, the exhilaration I was experiencing was not caused merely by an admiration for autumn, but by some desire. The great source of a joy which the soul feels at first without recognizing its cause, without understanding that it is motivated by nothing outside. And so I looked at the trees with an unsatisfied tenderness that passed beyond them and went on without my knowing it toward that masterpiece of lovely strolling women which they enclose each day for several hours. I went toward the allée des Acacias. I passed through old groves where the morning light imposed new divisions, pruning the trees, joining together the different stems, and composing bouquets. Deftly it drew toward itself a pair of trees; using the powerful scissors of a ray of light and a shadow, it cut off from each of them half its trunk and branches and, weaving together the two halves that remained, made of them either a single pillar of shadow, delimited by the sunshine around it, or a single phantom of brightness whose tremulous artificial contour was ringed by a net of black shadow. When a ray of sun gilded the highest branches, they seemed, steeped in a sparkling dampness, to emerge alone from the liquid emerald-colored atmosphere in which the entire forest was plunged as though under the sea. For the trees continued to live their own life and, when they had no more leaves, that life shone more brightly on the sheath of green velvet that wrapped their trunks or in the white enamel of the spheres of mistletoe that spangled the tops of the poplars, as round as the sun and the moon in Michelangelo’s Creation. But forced as they have been for so many years by a sort of grafting to live a life shared with women, they conjured up for me the wood nymph, the lovely quick and colorful worldly beauty whom they cover with their branches as she passes beneath them, obliging her to feel as they do the power of the season; they recalled to me the happy time of my believing youth, when I would avidly come to the places where masterpieces of feminine elegance were created for a few moments among the unconscious and complicitous leaves. But the beauty which the pines and acacias of the Bois de Boulogne made me desire, trees more disturbing because of this than the chestnuts and lilacs of Trianon that I was going to see, was not fixed outside me in the mementos of some historic period, in works of art, in a little temple to the god of Love whose base is piled with golden palmate leaves. I reached the shores of the lake, I went on as far as the Tir aux Pigeons.","It was also the time of day. In places where the trees still kept their leaves, they seemed to have undergone an alteration of their substance from the point at which they were touched by the sun's light, still, at this hour in the morning, almost horizontal, as it would be again, a few hours later, at the moment when, just as dusk began, it would flame up like a lamp, project afar over the leaves a warm and artificial glow, and set ablaze the few topmost boughs of a tree that would itself remain unchanged, a sombre incombustible candelabrum beneath its flaming crest. At one spot the light grew solid as a brick wall, and like a piece of yellow Persian masonry, patterned in blue, daubed coarsely upon the sky the leaves of the chestnuts; at another, it cut them off from the sky towards which they stretched out their curling, golden fingers. Half-way up the trunk of a tree draped with wild vine, the light had grafted and brought to blossom, too dazzling to be clearly distinguished, an enormous posy, of red flowers apparently, perhaps of a new variety of carnation. The different parts of the Bois, so easily confounded in summer in the density and monotony of their universal green, were now clearly divided. A patch of brightness indicated the approach to almost every one of them, or else a splendid mass of foliage stood out before it like an oriflamme. I could make out, as on a coloured map, Armenonville, the Pré Catalan, Madrid, the Race Course and the shore of the lake. Here and there would appear some meaningless erection, a sham grotto, a mill, for which the trees made room by drawing away from it, or which was borne upon the soft green platform of a grassy lawn. I could feel that the Bois was not really a wood, that it existed for a purpose alien to the life of its trees; my sense of exaltation was due not only to admiration of the autumn tints but to a bodily desire. Ample source of a joy which the heart feels at first without being conscious of its cause, without understanding that it results from no external impulse! Thus I gazed at the trees with an unsatisfied longing which went beyond them and, without my knowledge, directed itself towards that masterpiece of beautiful strolling women which the trees enframed for a few hours every day. I walked towards the Allée des Acacias. I passed through forest groves in which the morning light, breaking them into new sections, lopped and trimmed the trees, united different trunks in marriage, made nosegays of their branches. It would skilfully draw towards it a pair of trees; making deft use of the sharp chisel of light and shade, it would cut away from each of them half of its trunk and branches, and, weaving together the two halves that remained, would make of them either a single pillar of shade, defined by the surrounding light, or a single luminous phantom whose artificial, quivering contour was encompassed in a network of inky shadows. When a ray of sunshine gilded the highest branches, they seemed, soaked and still dripping with a sparkling moisture, to have emerged alone from the liquid, emerald-green atmosphere in which the whole grove was plunged as though beneath the sea. For the trees continued to live by their own vitality, and when they had no longer any leaves, that vitality gleamed more brightly still from the nap of green velvet that carpeted their trunks, or in the white enamel of the globes of mistletoe that were scattered all the way up to the topmost branches of the poplars, rounded as are the sun and moon in Michelangelo's 'Creation.' But, forced for so many years now, by a sort of grafting process, to share the life of feminine humanity, they called to my mind the figure of the dryad, the fair worldling, swiftly walking, brightly coloured, whom they sheltered with their branches as she passed beneath them, and obliged to acknowledge, as they themselves acknowledged, the power of the season; they recalled to me the happy days when I was young and had faith, when I would hasten eagerly to the spots where masterpieces of female elegance would be incarnate for a few moments beneath the unconscious, accommodating boughs. But the beauty for which the firs and acacias of the Bois de Boulogne made me long, more disquieting in that respect than the chestnuts and lilacs of Trianon which I was going to see, was not fixed somewhere outside myself in the relics of an historical period, in works of art, in a little temple of love at whose door was piled an oblation of autumn leaves ribbed with gold. I reached the shore of the lake; I walked on as far as the pigeon-shooting ground."
"Une fois elle lui parla d’une visite que Forcheville lui avait faite le jour de la Fête de Paris-Murcie. « Comment, tu le connaissais déjà ? Ah ! oui, c’est vrai », dit-il en se reprenant pour ne pas paraître l’avoir ignoré. Et tout d’un coup il se mit à trembler à la pensée que le jour de cette fête de Paris-Murcie où il avait reçu d’elle la lettre qu’il avait si précieusement gardée, elle déjeunait peut-être avec Forcheville à la Maison d’Or. Elle lui jura que non. « Pourtant la Maison d’Or me rappelle je ne sais quoi que j’ai su ne pas être vrai », lui dit-il pour l’effrayer. – « Oui, que je n’y étais pas allée le soir où je t’ai dit que j’en sortais quand tu m’avais cherchée chez Prévost », lui répondit-elle (croyant à son air qu’il le savait), avec une décision où il y avait, beaucoup plus que du cynisme, de la timidité, une peur de contrarier Swann et que par amour-propre elle voulait cacher, puis le désir de lui montrer qu’elle pouvait être franche. Aussi frappa-t-elle avec une netteté et une vigueur de bourreau et qui étaient exemptes de cruauté, car Odette n’avait pas conscience du mal qu’elle faisait à Swann ; et même elle se mit à rire, peut-être il est vrai, surtout pour ne pas avoir l’air humilié, confus. « C’est vrai que je n’avais pas été à la Maison Dorée, que je sortais de chez Forcheville. J’avais vraiment été chez Prévost, ça c’était pas de la blague, il m’y avait rencontrée et m’avait demandé d’entrer regarder ses gravures. Mais il était venu quelqu’un pour le voir.","Once she told him of a visit Forcheville had paid her on the day of the Paris-Murcia Festival. ""How, did you already know him?"" Ah! yes, that’s true,” he said, correcting himself so as not to appear to have ignored him. And all of a sudden he began to tremble at the thought that on the day of that Paris-Murcia party when he had received from her the letter which he had kept so preciously, she was perhaps lunching with Forcheville at the House of Gold. She swore to him no. ""Yet the House of Gold reminds me of something or other that I knew was not true,"" he told her to frighten her. – ""Yes, that I didn't go there the night I told you I was leaving when you looked for me at Prévost's,"" she answered him (believing by his look that he knew it) , with a decision in which there was much more than cynicism, shyness, a fear of upsetting Swann and which out of self-esteem she wanted to hide, then the desire to show him that she could be frank. So she struck with the sharpness and vigor of an executioner which was free from cruelty, for Odette was unaware of the harm she was doing Swann; and she even began to laugh, perhaps it is true, especially so as not to look humiliated, confused. “It is true that I had not been to the Maison Dorée, that I had just left Forcheville. I had really been to Prévost, that was no joke, he had met me there and asked me to come in and look at his engravings. But someone had come to see him.","One time she told him about a visit Forcheville had paid her on the day of the Paris-Murcia fete. “What? You already knew him back then? Yes, of course, that’s right,” he said, catching himself so as not to show that he had not known. And suddenly he began to tremble at the thought that on the day of the Paris-Murcia fete, on which he had received from her the letter he had kept so carefully, she had perhaps been having lunch with Forcheville at the Maison d’Or. She swore she had not. “Yet the Maison d’Or does remind me of something or other that I knew at the time wasn’t true,” he said in order to frighten her. “Yes, that I hadn’t actually been there at all that evening when I told you I had just come from there and you had been looking for me at Prévost ’s,” she answered (thinking from his expression that he knew this), with a decisiveness in which there was, not cynicism, but rather timidity, a fear of vexing Swann, which out of self-respect she wanted to hide, and also a desire to show him that she could be frank. Thus she struck with an executioner’s neatness and energy though quite without cruelty, for Odette was not conscious of the harm she was doing Swann; and she even began to laugh, perhaps, it is true, chiefly so as not to seem humiliated, embarrassed. “It’s quite true that I hadn’t been to the Maison Dorée; I was coming away from Forcheville’s house. I actually had been to Prévost’s, I didn’t make that up, and he ran into me there and asked me to come and look at his engravings. But someone else came to see him.","She spoke to him once of a visit that Forcheville had paid her on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête. "" What! you knew him as long ago as that? Oh, yes, of course you did,"" he corrected himself, so as not to shew that he had been ignorant of the fact. And suddenly he began to tremble at the thought that, on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête, when he had received that letter which he had so carefully preserved, she had been having luncheon, perhaps, with Forcheville at the Maison d'Or. She swore that she had not. "" Still, the Maison d'Or reminds me of something or other which, I knew at the time, wasn't true,"" he pursued, hoping to frighten her. "" Yes that I hadn't been there at all that evening when I told you I had just come from there, and you had been looking for me at Prévost's,"" she replied (judging by his manner that he knew) with a firmness that was based not so much upon cynicism as upon timidity, a fear of crossing Swann, which her own self-respect made her anxious to conceal, and a desire to shew him that she could be perfectly frank if she chose. And so she struck him with all the sharpness and force of a headsman wielding his axe, and yet could not be charged with cruelty, since she was quite unconscious of hurting him; she even began to laugh, though this may perhaps, it is true, have been chiefly to keep him from thinking that she was ashamed, at all, or confused. ""It's quite true, I hadn't been to the Maison Dorée. I was coming away from Forcheville's. I had, really, been to Prévost's— that wasn't a story—and he met me there and asked me to come in and look at his prints. But some one else came to see him."

"Mais dès que je l’eus appelée et qu’elle fut revenue près du lit de la Charité de Giotto, ses larmes cessèrent aussitôt de couler ; elle ne put reconnaître ni cette agréable sensation de pitié et d’attendrissement qu’elle connaissait bien et que la lecture des journaux lui avait souvent donnée, ni aucun plaisir de même famille ; dans l’ennui et dans l’irritation de s’être levée au milieu de la nuit pour la fille de cuisine, et à la vue des mêmes souffrances dont la description l’avait fait pleurer, elle n’eut plus que des ronchonnements de mauvaise humeur, même d’affreux sarcasmes, disant, quand elle crut que nous étions partis et ne pouvions plus l’entendre : « Elle n’avait qu’à ne pas faire ce qu’il faut pour ça ! ça lui a fait plaisir !","But as soon as I called her and she came back to Giotto's Charity bed, her tears immediately ceased; she could recognize neither that agreeable feeling of pity and tenderness which she knew well and which reading the newspapers had often given her, nor any pleasure of the same family; bored and irritated at having gotten up in the middle of the night for the kitchen maid, and at the sight of the same sufferings the description of which had made her cry, she only grumbled bad temper, even awful sarcasm, saying, when she thought we were gone and couldn't hear her anymore: ""She shouldn't have done anything about it!"" it made him happy!","But as soon as I called her and she came back to the bedside of Giotto’s Charity, her tears immediately stopped flowing; she could recognize neither the pleasant sensation of pity and tenderness which she knew so well and which reading the newspapers had so often given her, nor any kindred pleasure, in the bother and irritation of having gotten up in the middle of the night for the kitchen-maid, and at the sight of the same sufferings whose description had made her cry, she now produced nothing more than bad-tempered mutterings, even nasty pieces of sarcasm, saying, when she thought we had gone and could no longer hear her: “She had only to stop herself doing what you do to get this way! Sure she enjoyed it well enough!","But when I had called her, and she had returned to the bedside of Giotto's Charity, her tears at once ceased to flow; she could find no stimulus for that pleasant sensation of tenderness and pity which she very well knew, having been moved to it often enough by the perusal of newspapers; nor any other pleasure of the same kind in her sense of weariness and irritation at being pulled out of bed in the middle of the night for the kitchen-maid; so that at the sight of those very sufferings, the printed account of which had moved her to tears, she had nothing to offer but ill-tempered mutterings, mingled with bitter sarcasm, saying, when she thought that we had gone out of earshot: ""Well, she need never have done what she must have done to bring all this about! She found that pleasant enough, I dare say!"

"Qu’importait qu’elle lui dît que l’amour est fragile, le sien était si fort ! Il jouait avec la tristesse qu’elle répandait, il la sentait passer sur lui, mais comme une caresse qui rendait plus profond et plus doux le sentiment qu’il avait de son bonheur. Il la faisait rejouer dix fois, vingt fois à Odette, exigeant qu’en même temps elle ne cessât pas de l’embrasser. Chaque baiser appelle un autre baiser. Ah ! dans ces premiers temps où l’on aime, les baisers naissent si naturellement ! Ils foisonnent si pressés les uns contre les autres ; et l’on aurait autant de peine à compter les baisers qu’on s’est donnés pendant une heure que les fleurs d’un champ au mois de mai. Alors elle faisait mine de s’arrêter, disant : « Comment veux-tu que je joue comme cela si tu me tiens ? je ne peux tout faire à la fois ; sache au moins ce que tu veux ; est-ce que je dois jouer la phrase ou faire des petites caresses ? » ; lui se fâchait et elle éclatait d’un rire qui se changeait et retombait sur lui, en une pluie de baisers. Ou bien elle le regardait d’un air maussade, il revoyait un visage digne de figurer dans la Vie de Moïse de Botticelli, il l’y situait, il donnait au cou d’Odette l’inclinaison nécessaire ; et quand il l’avait bien peinte à la détrempe, au XVe siècle, sur la muraille de la Sixtine, l’idée qu’elle était cependant restée là, près du piano, dans le moment actuel, prête à être embrassée et possédée, l’idée de sa matérialité et de sa vie venait l’enivrer avec une telle force que, l’œil égaré, les mâchoires tendues comme pour dévorer, il se précipitait sur cette vierge de Botticelli et se mettait à lui pincer les joues. Puis, une fois qu’il l’avait quittée, non sans être rentré pour l’embrasser encore parce qu’il avait oublié d’emporter dans son souvenir quelque particularité de son odeur ou de ses traits, il revenait dans sa victoria, bénissant Odette de lui permettre ces visites quotidiennes, dont il sentait qu’elles ne devaient pas lui causer à elle une bien grande joie, mais qui en le préservant de devenir jaloux – en lui ôtant l’occasion de souffrir de nouveau du mal qui s’était déclaré en lui le soir où il ne l’avait pas trouvée chez les Verdurin – l’aideraient à arriver, sans avoir plus d’autres de ces crises dont la première avait été si douloureuse et resterait la seule, au bout de ces heures singulières de sa vie, heures presque enchantées, à la façon de celles où il traversait Paris au clair de lune. Et, remarquant, pendant ce retour, que l’astre était maintenant déplacé par rapport à lui, et presque au bout de l’horizon, sentant que son amour obéissait, lui aussi, à des lois immuables et naturelles, il se demandait si cette période où il était entré durerait encore longtemps, si bientôt sa pensée ne verrait plus le cher visage qu’occupant une position lointaine et diminuée, et près de cesser de répandre du charme. Car Swann en trouvait aux choses, depuis qu’il était amoureux, comme au temps où, adolescent, il se croyait artiste ; mais ce n’était plus le même charme ; celui-ci, c’est Odette seule qui le leur conférait. Il sentait renaître en lui les inspirations de sa jeunesse qu’une vie frivole avait dissipées, mais elles portaient toutes le reflet, la marque d’un être particulier ; et, dans les longues heures qu’il prenait maintenant un plaisir délicat à passer chez lui, seul avec son âme en convalescence, il redevenait peu à peu lui-même, mais à une autre.","What did it matter that she told him that love is fragile, hers was so strong! He played with the sadness she was spreading, he felt it pass over him, but like a caress that made his feeling of happiness deeper and sweeter. He made her play Odette again ten times, twenty times, demanding that at the same time she should not stop kissing him. Every kiss calls for another kiss. Ah! in these first times when we love, kisses are born so naturally! They abound so pressed against each other; and one would have as much difficulty in counting the kisses that one gave each other during an hour as the flowers of a field in the month of May. So she pretended to stop, saying, ""How do you expect me to play like this if you hold me?"" I cannot do everything at once; at least know what you want; do I have to play the sentence or give little caresses? » ; he grew angry and she burst into a laugh that changed and fell on him, in a shower of kisses. Either she would look at him sullenly, he would see again a face worthy of figuring in Botticelli's Life of Moses, he placed it there, he gave Odette's neck the necessary inclination; and when he had painted her in tempera, in the fifteenth century, on the Sistine wall, the idea that she had nevertheless remained there, near the piano, in the present moment, ready to be embraced and possessed, the idea of her materiality and of her life came to intoxicate him with such force that, his eyes bewildered, his jaws tense as if to devour, he rushed upon this virgin of Botticelli and began to pinch her cheeks. Then, once he had left her, not without returning to kiss her again because he had forgotten to remember some peculiarity of her smell or her features, he returned to his victoria, blessing Odette to allow him these daily visits, which he felt should not cause her any great joy, but which, by preserving him from becoming jealous - by depriving him of the opportunity to suffer again from the evil that was was declared in him the evening when he had not found her at the Verdurins' - would help him to arrive, without having more of those crises, the first of which had been so painful and would remain the only one, at the end of those hours singular moments of his life, almost enchanted hours, like those when he crossed Paris by moonlight. And, noticing, during this return, that the star was now displaced in relation to him, and almost at the end of the horizon, feeling that his love also obeyed immutable and natural laws, he wondered if this the period he had entered would still last a long time, if soon his thought would no longer see the dear face except occupying a distant and diminished position, and about to cease to shed charm. For Swann found it in things, since he was in love, as when, as an adolescent, he thought he was an artist; but it was no longer the same charm; this, it was Odette alone who conferred it on them. He felt reborn within him the inspirations of his youth which a frivolous life had dissipated, but they all bore the reflection, the mark of a particular being; and, in the long hours which he now took a delicate pleasure in spending at home, alone with his soul in convalescence, he gradually became himself again, but to another.","What did it matter if it told him love was fragile, his own love was so strong! He toyed with the sadness it diffused, he felt it pass over him, but in a caress that only deepened and sweetened his sense of his own happiness. He made Odette play it ten times, twenty times, demanding that while she did so she should not stop kissing him. Each kiss summons another. Ah, in those first days of our love, kisses come so naturally! So closely, in their profusion, do they crowd together; and it would be as hard for us to count the kisses we give each other in an hour as the flowers of a field in the month of May. Then she would make as if to stop, saying: “How can you expect me to play if you hold on to me? I can’t do everything at once. Now decide what you want—should I play the piano or play with you? ,” he would become annoyed, she would burst out laughing, and her laughter would change and descend on him in a rain of kisses. Or she would look at him with a sullen expression, once again he would see before him a face worthy of figuring in Botticelli’s Life of Moses, he would place her in it, he would give her neck the necessary inclination; and when he had well and truly painted her in distemper, in the fifteenth century, on the wall of the Sistine Chapel, the idea that she had nevertheless remained here, by the piano, in the present moment, ready to be kissed and possessed, the idea of her materiality and her life would intoxicate him with such force that, his eyes distracted, his jaw tensed as though to devour her, he would swoop down upon that Botticelli virgin and begin pinching her cheeks. Then, once he had left her, not without going back in to kiss her again because he had forgotten to carry away in his memory some detail of her fragrance or her features, while he was returning home in his victoria, he would bless Odette for allowing him these daily visits, which he felt could not give her very great joy, but which, by saving him from becoming jealous—by relieving him of the occasion for suffering again from the disease that had broken out in him on the evening when he had not found her at the Verdurins’—would help him to arrive, without having any more of those crises of which the first had been so painful and must remain the only one, at the end of this singular period of his life, these hours that were almost enchanted, like those in which he crossed Paris in the light of the moon. And noticing, during his return, that the star had now moved in relation to him and was almost at the edge of the horizon, feeling that his love, too, was obeying immutable and natural laws, he asked himself whether this period he had entered would last much longer, whether, soon, his thoughts would no longer see the dear face except as occupying a distant and diminished place, and nearly ceasing to radiate any charm. For Swann did find charm in things, now that he was in love, just as during the period when, as an adolescent, he had thought he was an artist; but this was no longer the same charm; Odette alone conferred it on them. He felt the inspirations of his youth, which had been dissipated by a frivolous life, reawakening in him, but they all bore the reflection, the mark of a particular being; and, in the long hours which he now found a delicate pleasure in spending at home, alone with his convalescing soul, little by little he became himself again, but possessed by another.","What matter though the phrase repeated that love is frail and fleeting, when his love was so strong! He played with the melancholy which the phrase diffused, he felt it stealing over him, but like a caress which only deepened and sweetened his sense of his own happiness. He would make Odette play him the phrase again, ten, twenty times on end, insisting that, while she played, she must never cease to kiss him. Every kiss provokes another. Ah, in those earliest days of love how naturally the kisses spring into life. How closely, in their abundance, are they pressed one against another; until lovers would find it as hard to count the kisses exchanged in an hour, as to count the flowers in a meadow in May. Then she would pretend to stop, saying: ""How do you expect me to play when you keep on holding me? I can't do everything at once. Make up your mind what you want; am I to play the phrase or do you want to play with me? "" Then he would become annoyed, and she would burst out with a laugh which, was transformed, as it left her lips, and descended upon him in a shower of kisses. Or else she would look at him sulkily, and he would see once again a face worthy to figure in Botticelli's 'Life of Moses,' he would place it there, giving to Odette's neck the necessary inclination; and when he had finished her portrait in distemper, in the fifteenth century, on the wall of the Sixtine, the idea that she was, none the less, in the room with him still, by the piano, at that very moment, ready to be kissed and won, the idea of her material existence, of her being alive, would sweep over him with so violent an intoxication that, with eyes starting from his head and jaws that parted as though to devour her, he would fling himself upon this Botticelli maiden and kiss and bite her cheeks. And then, as soon as he had left the house, not without returning to kiss her once again, because he had forgotten to take away with him, in memory, some detail of her fragrance or of her features, while he drove home in his victoria, blessing the name of Odette who allowed him to pay her these daily visits, which, although they could not, he felt, bring any great happiness to her, still, by keeping him immune from the fever of jealousy—by removing from him every possibility of a fresh outbreak of the heart-sickness which had manifested itself in him that evening, when he had failed to find her at the Verdurins'—might help him to arrive, without any recurrence of those crises, of which the first had been so distressing that it must also be the last, at the termination of this strange series of hours in his life, hours almost enchanted, in the same manner as these other, following hours, in which he drove through a deserted Paris by the light of the moon: noticing as he drove home that the satellite had now changed its position, relatively to his own, and was almost touching the horizon; feeling that his love, also, was obedient to these immutable laws of nature, he asked himself whether this period, upon which he had entered, was to last much longer, whether presently his mind's eye would cease to behold that dear countenance, save as occupying a distant and diminished position, and on the verge of ceasing to shed on him the radiance of its charm. For Swann was finding in things once more, since he had fallen in love, the charm that he had found when, in his adolescence, he had fancied himself an artist; with this difference, that what charm lay in them now was conferred by Odette alone. He could feel reawakening in himself the inspirations of his boyhood, which had been dissipated among the frivolities of his later life, but they all bore, now, the reflection, the stamp of a particular being; and during the long hours which he now found a subtle pleasure in spending at home, alone with his convalescent spirit, he became gradually himself again, but himself in thraldom to another."
"– Puisque vous le voulez, répondit Odette sur un ton de marivaudage, et elle ajouta : vous savez que je ne suis pas « fishing for compliments ».","""Since you want it,"" Odette answered in a tone of marivaudage, and she added: you know that I'm not ""fishing for compliments.""","“Well, if you say so,” answered Odette in a mincing tone, and she added: “You know I’m not fishing for compliments.” 5 “All right!","""Just as you like,"" replied Odette, in an affected tone, and then went on: ""You know I'm not fishing for compliments."""
"Mais tout à coup ce fut comme si elle était entrée, et cette apparition lui fut une si déchirante souffrance qu’il dut porter la main à son cœur. C’est que le violon était monté à des notes hautes où il restait comme pour une attente, une attente qui se prolongeait sans qu’il cessât de les tenir, dans l’exaltation où il était d’apercevoir déjà l’objet de son attente qui s’approchait, et avec un effort désespéré pour tâcher de durer jusqu’à son arrivée, de l’accueillir avant d’expirer, de lui maintenir encore un moment de toutes ses dernières forces le chemin ouvert pour qu’il pût passer, comme on soutient une porte qui sans cela retomberait. Et avant que Swann eût eu le temps de comprendre, et de se dire : « C’est la petite phrase de la sonate de Vinteuil, n’écoutons pas ! » tous ses souvenirs du temps où Odette était éprise de lui, et qu’il avait réussi jusqu’à ce jour à maintenir invisibles dans les profondeurs de son être, trompés par ce brusque rayon du temps d’amour qu’ils crurent revenu, s’étaient réveillés et, à tire d’aile, étaient remontés lui chanter éperdument, sans pitié pour son infortune présente, les refrains oubliés du bonheur.","But suddenly it was as if she had entered, and this apparition caused him such heartrending pain that he had to put his hand to his heart. It was because the violin had risen to high notes where it remained as if for an expectation, an expectation which was prolonged without his ceasing to hold them, in the exaltation in which he was to already perceive the object of his approaching expectation, and with a desperate effort to try to last until his arrival, to welcome him before expiring, to keep for him a moment longer with all his last strength the path open so that he could pass , as one supports a door which would otherwise fall. And before Swann had had time to understand, and to say to himself: “It’s the little phrase from Vinteuil’s sonata, let’s not listen! » all his memories of the time when Odette was in love with him, and which he had managed to keep invisible in the depths of his being until this day, deceived by this sudden ray of the time of love which they thought had returned, had woken up and, flying, had gone up to sing to him madly, without pity for his present misfortune, the forgotten refrains of happiness.","But suddenly it was as though she had appeared in the room, and this apparition caused him such harrowing pain that he had to put his hand on his heart. What had happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes on which it lingered as though waiting for something, holding on to them in a prolonged expectancy, in the exaltation of already seeing the object of its expectation approaching, and with a desperate effort to try to endure until it arrived, to welcome it before expiring, to keep the way open for it another moment with a last bit of strength so that it could come through, as one holds up a trapdoor that would otherwise fall back. And before Swann had time to understand, and say to himself: “It’s the little phrase from the sonata by Vinteuil; don’t listen!” all his memories of the time when Odette was in love with him, which he had managed until now to keep out of sight in the deepest part of himself, deceived by this sudden beam of light from the time of love which they believed had returned, had awoken and flown swiftly back up to sing madly to him, with no pity for his present misfortune, the forgotten refrains of happiness.","But suddenly it was as though she had entered, and this apparition tore him with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his heart. What had happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes, on which it rested as though expecting something, an expectancy which it prolonged without ceasing to hold on to the notes, in the exaltation with which it already saw the expected object approaching, and with a desperate effort to continue until its arrival, to welcome it before itself expired, to keep the way open for a moment longer, with all its remaining strength, that the stranger might enter in, as one holds a door open that would otherwise automatically close. And before Swann had had time to understand what was happening, to think: ""It is the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata. I mustn't listen!"" , all his memories of the days when Odette had been in love with him, which he had succeeded, up till that evening, in keeping invisible in the depths of his being, deceived by this sudden reflection of a season of love, whose sun, they supposed, had dawned again, had awakened from their slumber, had taken wing and risen to sing maddeningly in his ears, without pity for his present desolation, the forgotten strains of happiness."
"Maman s’assit à côté de mon lit ; elle avait pris François le Champi à qui sa couverture rougeâtre et son titre incompréhensible donnaient pour moi une personnalité distincte et un attrait mystérieux. Je n’avais jamais lu encore de vrais romans. J’avais entendu dire que George Sand était le type du romancier. Cela me disposait déjà à imaginer dans François le Champi quelque chose d’indéfinissable et de délicieux. Les procédés de narration destinés à exciter la curiosité ou l’attendrissement, certaines façons de dire qui éveillent l’inquiétude et la mélancolie, et qu’un lecteur un peu instruit reconnaît pour communs à beaucoup de romans, me paraissaient simples – à moi qui considérais un livre nouveau non comme une chose ayant beaucoup de semblables, mais comme une personne unique, n’ayant de raison d’exister qu’en soi – une émanation troublante de l’essence particulière à François le Champi. Sous ces événements si journaliers, ces choses si communes, ces mots si courants, je sentais comme une intonation, une accentuation étrange. L’action s’engagea ; elle me parut d’autant plus obscure que dans ce temps-là, quand je lisais, je rêvassais souvent, pendant des pages entières, à tout autre chose. Et aux lacunes que cette distraction laissait dans le récit, s’ajoutait, quand c’était maman qui me lisait à haute voix, qu’elle passait toutes les scènes d’amour. Aussi tous les changements bizarres qui se produisent dans l’attitude respective de la meunière et de l’enfant et qui ne trouvent leur explication que dans les progrès d’un amour naissant me paraissaient empreints d’un profond mystère dont je me figurais volontiers que la source devait être dans ce nom inconnu et si doux de « Champi » qui mettait sur l’enfant, qui le portait sans que je susse pourquoi, sa couleur vive, empourprée et charmante. Si ma mère était une lectrice infidèle, c’était aussi, pour les ouvrages où elle trouvait l’accent d’un sentiment vrai, une lectrice admirable par le respect et la simplicité de l’interprétation, par la beauté et la douceur du son. Même dans la vie, quand c’étaient des êtres et non des œuvres d’art qui excitaient ainsi son attendrissement ou son admiration, c’était touchant de voir avec quelle déférence elle écartait de sa voix, de son geste, de ses propos, tel éclat de gaîté qui eût pu faire mal à cette mère qui avait autrefois perdu un enfant, tel rappel de fête, d’anniversaire, qui aurait pu faire penser ce vieillard à son grand âge, tel propos de ménage qui aurait paru fastidieux à ce jeune savant. De même, quand elle lisait la prose de George Sand, qui respire toujours cette bonté, cette distinction morale que maman avait appris de ma grand’mère à tenir pour supérieures à tout dans la vie, et que je ne devais lui apprendre que bien plus tard à ne pas tenir également pour supérieures à tout dans les livres, attentive à bannir de sa voix toute petitesse, toute affectation qui eût pu empêcher le flot puissant d’y être reçu, elle fournissait toute la tendresse naturelle, toute l’ample douceur qu’elles réclamaient à ces phrases qui semblaient écrites pour sa voix et qui pour ainsi dire tenaient tout entières dans le registre de sa sensibilité. Elle retrouvait pour les attaquer dans le ton qu’il faut l’accent cordial qui leur préexiste et les dicta, mais que les mots n’indiquent pas ; grâce à lui elle amortissait au passage toute crudité dans les temps des verbes, donnait à l’imparfait et au passé défini la douceur qu’il y a dans la bonté, la mélancolie qu’il y a dans la tendresse, dirigeait la phrase qui finissait vers celle qui allait commencer, tantôt pressant, tantôt ralentissant la marche des syllabes pour les faire entrer, quoique leurs quantités fussent différentes, dans un rythme uniforme, elle insufflait à cette prose si commune une sorte de vie sentimentale et continue.","Mom sat beside my bed; it had taken François le Champi, whose reddish cover and incomprehensible title gave me a distinct personality and a mysterious appeal. I had never read real novels before. I had heard that George Sand was the type of novelist. This already disposed me to imagine something indefinable and delicious in François le Champi. Narrative procedures intended to arouse curiosity or tenderness, certain ways of speaking which arouse anxiety and melancholy, and which a somewhat educated reader recognizes as common to many novels, seemed simple to me – to me who considered a new book not as a thing with many similarities, but as a unique person, having no reason to exist except in itself – a disturbing emanation of the particular essence of François le Champi. Beneath these so daily events, these so common things, these so common words, I felt something like an intonation, a strange accentuation. The action began; it seemed to me all the more obscure in that in those days, when I was reading, I often dreamed, for whole pages, of something quite different. And to the gaps that this distraction left in the story, was added, when it was mom who read me aloud, that she played all the love scenes. Also all the bizarre changes which occur in the respective attitudes of the miller and the child and which find their explanation only in the progress of a nascent love seemed to me stamped with a profound mystery which I readily imagined the source must have been in this unknown and so sweet name of ""Champi"" which put on the child, who carried him without my knowing why, his lively, purple and charming color. If my mother was an unfaithful reader, she was also, for the works in which she found the accent of a true feeling, an admirable reader for the respect and the simplicity of the interpretation, for the beauty and the sweetness of the sound. . Even in real life, when it was human beings and not works of art which thus excited her tenderness or her admiration, it was touching to see with what deference she dismissed with her voice, her gesture, her words, such a burst of gaiety which could have hurt this mother who had once lost a child, such a reminder of a party, of a birthday, which could have made the old man think of his old age, such a domestic conversation which would have seemed tedious to this young scholar. In the same way, when she read the prose of George Sand, which always exudes that goodness, that moral distinction which my mother had taught my grandmother to hold as superior to everything in life, and which I was only to teach her much more. too late not to consider superior to everything in the books, careful to banish from her voice any smallness, any affectation that could have prevented the powerful wave from being received there, she provided all the natural tenderness, all the ample sweetness they demanded from these sentences which seemed written for her voice and which, so to speak, belonged entirely to the register of her sensibility. She rediscovered to attack them in the right tone the cordial accent which existed before them and dictated them, but which the words do not indicate; thanks to him she deadened in passing any rawness in the tenses of the verbs, gave to the imperfect and the definite past the sweetness that there is in kindness, the melancholy that there is in tenderness, directed the sentence which ended towards the one that was about to begin, sometimes pressing, sometimes slowing down the progress of the syllables to make them enter, although their quantities were different, in a uniform rhythm, it breathed into this so common prose a sort of sentimental and continuous life.","Mama sat down by my bed; she had picked up François le Champi, whose reddish cover and incomprehensible title gave it, in my eyes, a distinct personality and a mysterious attraction. I had not yet read a real novel. I had heard people say that George Sand was an exemplary novelist. This already predisposed me to imagine something indefinable and delicious in François le Champi. Narrative devices intended to arouse curiosity or emotion, certain modes of expression that make one uneasy or melancholy, and that a reader with some education will recognize as common to many novels, appeared to me—who considered a new book not as a thing having many counterparts, but as a unique person, having no reason for existing but in itself—simply as a disturbing emanation of François le Champi’s peculiar essence. Behind those events so ordinary, those things so common, those words so current, I sensed a strange sort of intonation, accentuation. The action began; it seemed to me all the more obscure because in those days, when I read, I often daydreamed, for entire pages, of something quite different. And in addition to the lacunae that this distraction left in the story, there was the fact, when Mama was the one reading aloud to me, that she skipped all the love scenes. Thus, all the bizarre changes that take place in the respective attitudes of the miller’s wife and the child and that can be explained only by the progress of a nascent love seemed to me marked by a profound mystery whose source I readily imagined must be in that strange and sweet name “Champi,” which gave the child, who bore it without my knowing why, its vivid, charming purplish color. If my mother was an unfaithful reader she was also, in the case of books in which she found the inflection of true feeling, a wonderful reader for the respect and simplicity of her interpretation, the beauty and gentleness of the sound of her voice. Even in real life, when it was people and not works of art which moved her to compassion or admiration, it was touching to see with what deference she removed from her voice, from her motions, from her words, any spark of gaiety that might hurt some mother who had once lost a child, any recollection of a saint’s day or birthday that might remind some old man of his advanced age, any remark about housekeeping that might seem tedious to some young scholar. In the same way, when she was reading George Sand’s prose, which always breathes that goodness, that moral distinction which Mama had learned from my grandmother to consider superior to all else in life, and which I was to teach her only much later not to consider superior to all else in books too, taking care to banish from her voice any pettiness, any affectation which might have prevented it from receiving that powerful torrent, she imparted all the natural tenderness, all the ample sweetness they demanded to those sentences which seemed written for her voice and which remained, so to speak, entirely within the register of her sensibility. She found, to attack them in the necessary tone, the warm inflection that preexists them and that dictated them, but that the words do not indicate; with this inflection she softened as she went along any crudeness in the tenses of the verbs, gave the imperfect and the past historic the sweetness that lies in goodness, the melancholy that lies in tenderness, directed the sentence that was ending toward the one that was about to begin, sometimes hurrying, sometimes slowing down the pace of the syllables so as to bring them, though their quantities were different, into one uniform rhythm, she breathed into this very common prose a sort of continuous emotional life.","Mamma sat down by my bed; she had chosen François le Champi, whose reddish cover and incomprehensible title gave it a distinct personality in my eyes and a mysterious attraction. I had not then read any real novels. I had heard it said that George Sand was a typical novelist. That prepared me in advance to imagine that François le Champi contained something inexpressibly delicious. The course of the narrative, where it tended to arouse curiosity or melt to pity, certain modes of expression which disturb or sadden the reader, and which, with a little experience, he may recognise as 'common form' in novels, seemed to me then distinctive—for to me a new book was not one of a number of similar objects, but was like an individual man, unmatched, and with no cause of existence beyond himself—an intoxicating whiff of the peculiar essence of François le Champi. Beneath the everyday incidents, the commonplace thoughts and hackneyed words, I could hear, or overhear, an intonation, a rhythmic utterance fine and strange. The 'action' began: to me it seemed all the more obscure because in those days, when I read to myself, I used often, while I turned the pages, to dream of something quite different. And to the gaps which this habit made in my knowledge of the story more were added by the fact that when it was Mamma who was reading to me aloud she left all the love-scenes out. And so all the odd changes which take place in the relations between the miller's wife and the boy, changes which only the birth and growth of love can explain, seemed to me plunged and steeped in a mystery, the key to which (as I could readily believe) lay in that strange and pleasant-sounding name of Champi, which draped the boy who bore it, I knew not why, in its own bright colour, purpurate and charming. If my mother was not a faithful reader, she was, none the less, admirable when reading a work in which she found the note of true feeling by the respectful simplicity of her interpretation and by the sound of her sweet and gentle voice. It was the same in her daily life, when it was not works of art but men and women whom she was moved to pity or admire: it was touching to observe with what deference she would banish from her voice, her gestures, from her whole conversation, now the note of joy which might have distressed some mother who had long ago lost a child, now the recollection of an event or anniversary which might have reminded some old gentleman of the burden of his years, now the household topic which might have bored some young man of letters. And so, when she read aloud the prose of George Sand, prose which is everywhere redolent of that generosity and moral distinction which Mamma had learned from my grandmother to place above all other qualities in life, and which I was not to teach her until much later to refrain from placing, in the same way, above all other qualities in literature; taking pains to banish from her voice any weakness or affectation which might have blocked its channel for that powerful stream of language, she supplied all the natural tenderness, all the lavish sweetness which they demanded to phrases which seemed to have been composed for her voice, and which were all, so to speak, within her compass. She came to them with the tone that they required, with the cordial accent which existed before they were, which dictated them, but which is not to be found in the words themselves, and by these means she smoothed away, as she read on, any harshness there might be or discordance in the tenses of verbs, endowing the imperfect and the preterite with all the sweetness which there is in generosity, all the melancholy which there is in love; guided the sentence that was drawing to an end towards that which was waiting to begin, now hastening, now slackening the pace of the syllables so as to bring them, despite their difference of quantity, into a uniform rhythm, and breathed into this quite ordinary prose a kind of life, continuous and full of feeling."

"Ce n’était pas seulement d’ailleurs la brillante phalange de vertueuses douairières, de généraux, d’académiciens, avec lesquels il était particulièrement lié, que Swann forçait avec tant de cynisme à lui servir d’entremetteurs. Tous ses amis avaient l’habitude de recevoir de temps en temps des lettres de lui où un mot de recommandation ou d’introduction leur était demandé avec une habileté diplomatique qui, persistant à travers les amours successives et les prétextes différents, accusait, plus que n’eussent fait les maladresses, un caractère permanent et des buts identiques. Je me suis souvent fait raconter bien des années plus tard, quand je commençai à m’intéresser à son caractère à cause des ressemblances qu’en de tout autres parties il offrait avec le mien, que quand il écrivait à mon grand-père (qui ne l’était pas encore, car c’est vers l’époque de ma naissance que commença la grande liaison de Swann et elle interrompit longtemps ces pratiques) celui-ci, en reconnaissant sur l’enveloppe l’écriture de son ami, s’écriait : « Voilà Swann qui va demander quelque chose : à la garde ! » Et soit méfiance, soit par le sentiment inconsciemment diabolique qui nous pousse à n’offrir une chose qu’aux gens qui n’en ont pas envie, mes grands-parents opposaient une fin de non-recevoir absolue aux prières les plus faciles à satisfaire qu’il leur adressait, comme de le présenter à une jeune fille qui dînait tous les dimanches à la maison, et qu’ils étaient obligés, chaque fois que Swann leur en reparlait, de faire semblant de ne plus voir, alors que pendant toute la semaine on se demandait qui on pourrait bien inviter avec elle, finissant souvent par ne trouver personne, faute de faire signe à celui qui en eût été si heureux.","Moreover, it was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers, generals, academicians, with whom he was particularly intimate, whom Swann so cynically forced to serve as his go-betweens. All his friends used to receive letters from him from time to time in which a word of recommendation or introduction was asked of them with a diplomatic skill which, persisting through successive loves and different pretexts, accused, more than had it not been for the blunders, a permanent character and identical goals. I have often been told many years later, when I began to take an interest in his character because of the resemblances he had in all other parts to mine, than when he wrote to my grandfather (who was not yet, because it was around the time of my birth that Swann's great affair began and she interrupted these practices for a long time) the latter, on recognizing his friend's handwriting on the envelope, s exclaimed: ""Here's Swann, who's going to ask for something: on guard!"" And either out of distrust, or out of the unconsciously diabolical feeling that drives us to offer something only to people who don't want it, my grandparents utterly rejected the easiest prayers. satisfy that he addressed to them, like introducing him to a young girl who dined at home every Sunday, and that they were obliged, each time Swann spoke to them about it again, to pretend not to see anymore, whereas during all week we wondered who we could invite with her, often ending up finding no one, for lack of making a sign to the one who would have been so happy.","And it was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers, generals, and academicians with whom he was particularly close, whom Swann compelled with such cynicism to serve him as go-betweens. All his friends were used to receiving periodic letters from him in which a word of recommendation or introduction was asked of them with a diplomatic skill that, persisting as it did through his successive love affairs and different pretexts, revealed, more than moments of awkwardness would have done, a permanent trait in his character and an unvarying quest. I often asked to hear, many years later when I began to take an interest in his character because of the resemblances it offered to my own in completely different respects , how when he wrote to my grandfather (who was not my grandfather yet, for it was about the time of my birth that Swann’s great love affair began, and it interrupted these habits for a long time), the latter, recognizing his friend’s handwriting on the envelope, would exclaim: “It’s Swann, about to ask for something: on guard!” And either from mistrust, or from the unconsciously diabolical spirit that incites us to offer a thing only to the people who do not want it, my grandparents would issue a blunt refusal to the most easily satisfied requests he addressed to them, as for instance to introduce him to a girl who dined at the house every Sunday, and whom they were obliged, each time Swann mentioned it to them again, to pretend they were no longer seeing, whereas all week long they would wonder who in the world they could invite with her, often finding no one in the end, because they would not ask the one who would have been so happy to come.","It was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers, generals and academicians, to whom he was bound by such close ties, that Swann compelled with so much cynicism to serve him as panders. All his friends were accustomed to receive, from time to time, letters which called on them for a word of recommendation or introduction, with a diplomatic adroitness which, persisting throughout all his successive 'affairs' and using different pretexts, revealed more glaringly than the clumsiest indiscretion, a permanent trait in his character and an unvarying quest. I used often to recall to myself when, many years later, I began to take an interest in his character because of the similarities which, in wholly different respects, it offered to my own, how, when he used to write to my grandfather (though not at the time we are now considering, for it was about the date of my own birth that Swann's great 'affair' began, and made a long interruption in his amatory practices) the latter, recognising his friend's handwriting on the envelope, would exclaim: ""Here is Swann asking for something; on guard!"" And, either from distrust or from the unconscious spirit of devilry which urges us to offer a thing only to those who do not want it, my grandparents would meet with an obstinate refusal the most easily satisfied of his prayers, as when he begged them for an introduction to a girl who dined with us every Sunday, and whom they were obliged, whenever Swann mentioned her, to pretend that they no longer saw, although they would be wondering, all through the week, whom they could invite to meet her, and often failed, in the end, to find anyone, sooner than make a sign to him who would so gladly have accepted."

"On ne se gênait guère pour l’envoyer quérir dès qu’on avait besoin d’une recette de sauce gribiche ou de salade à l’ananas pour de grands dîners où on ne l’invitait pas, ne lui trouvant pas un prestige suffisant pour qu’on pût le servir à des étrangers qui venaient pour la première fois. Si la conversation tombait sur les princes de la Maison de France : « des gens que nous ne connaîtrons jamais ni vous ni moi et nous nous en passons, n’est-ce pas », disait ma grand’tante à Swann qui avait peut-être dans sa poche une lettre de Twickenham ; elle lui faisait pousser le piano et tourner les pages les soirs où la sœur de ma grand’mère chantait, ayant, pour manier cet être ailleurs si recherché, la naïve brusquerie d’un enfant qui joue avec un bibelot de collection sans plus de précautions qu’avec un objet bon marché. Sans doute le Swann que connurent à la même époque tant de clubmen était bien différent de celui que créait ma grand’tante, quand le soir, dans le petit jardin de Combray, après qu’avaient retenti les deux coups hésitants de la clochette, elle injectait et vivifiait de tout ce qu’elle savait sur la famille Swann l’obscur et incertain personnage qui se détachait, suivi de ma grand’mère, sur un fond de ténèbres, et qu’on reconnaissait à la voix. Mais même au point de vue des plus insignifiantes choses de la vie, nous ne sommes pas un tout matériellement constitué, identique pour tout le monde et dont chacun n’a qu’à aller prendre connaissance comme d’un cahier des charges ou d’un testament ; notre personnalité sociale est une création de la pensée des autres. Même l’acte si simple que nous appelons « voir une personne que nous connaissons » est en partie un acte intellectuel. Nous remplissons l’apparence physique de l’être que nous voyons de toutes les notions que nous avons sur lui, et dans l’aspect total que nous nous représentons, ces notions ont certainement la plus grande part. Elles finissent par gonfler si parfaitement les joues, par suivre en une adhérence si exacte la ligne du nez, elles se mêlent si bien de nuancer la sonorité de la voix comme si celle-ci n’était qu’une transparente enveloppe, que chaque fois que nous voyons ce visage et que nous entendons cette voix, ce sont ces notions que nous retrouvons, que nous écoutons. Sans doute, dans le Swann qu’ils s’étaient constitué, mes parents avaient omis par ignorance de faire entrer une foule de particularités de sa vie mondaine qui étaient cause que d’autres personnes, quand elles étaient en sa présence, voyaient les élégances régner dans son visage et s’arrêter à son nez busqué comme à leur frontière naturelle ; mais aussi ils avaient pu entasser dans ce visage désaffecté de son prestige, vacant et spacieux, au fond de ces yeux dépréciés, le vague et doux résidu – mi-mémoire, mi-oubli – des heures oisives passées ensemble après nos dîners hebdomadaires, autour de la table de jeu ou au jardin, durant notre vie de bon voisinage campagnard. L’enveloppe corporelle de notre ami en avait été si bien bourrée, ainsi que de quelques souvenirs relatifs à ses parents, que ce Swann-là était devenu un être complet et vivant, et que j’ai l’impression de quitter une personne pour aller vers une autre qui en est distincte, quand, dans ma mémoire, du Swann que j’ai connu plus tard avec exactitude, je passe à ce premier Swann – à ce premier Swann dans lequel je retrouve les erreurs charmantes de ma jeunesse, et qui d’ailleurs ressemble moins à l’autre qu’aux personnes que j’ai connues à la même époque, comme s’il en était de notre vie ainsi que d’un musée où tous les portraits d’un même temps ont un air de famille, une même tonalité – à ce premier Swann rempli de loisir, parfumé par l’odeur du grand marronnier, des paniers de framboises et d’un brin d’estragon.","We didn't hesitate to send for him as soon as we needed a recipe for gribiche sauce or pineapple salad for big dinners where we didn't invite him, not finding him a sufficient prestige to that it could be served to strangers who came for the first time. If the conversation fell on the princes of the House of France: ""people whom we will never know, neither you nor me, and we do without them, don't we,"" said my great-aunt to Swann, who had perhaps be in his pocket a letter from Twickenham; she made him push the piano and turn the pages on the evenings when my grandmother's sister sang, having, to handle this being so much sought after elsewhere, the naive abruptness of a child who plays with a collector's item of trinket without more precautions. than with a cheap object. No doubt the Swann that so many clubmen knew at the same time was very different from the one my great-aunt created when, in the evening, in the little garden at Combray, after the two hesitant strokes of the bell had sounded, she injected and vivified with all that she knew about the Swann family the obscure and uncertain character who stood out, followed by my grandmother, against a background of darkness, and whom one recognized by her voice. But even from the point of view of the most insignificant things in life, we are not a materially constituted whole, identical for everyone and which everyone has only to go and read as a specification or a will ; our social personality is a creation of the thinking of others. Even the simple act we call “seeing someone we know” is partly an intellectual act. We fill the physical appearance of the being we see with all the notions that we have about him, and in the total aspect that we represent to ourselves, these notions certainly have the greatest part. They end up puffing out the cheeks so perfectly, following the line of the nose with such exact adherence, they combine so well to nuance the sonority of the voice as if it were only a transparent envelope, that each time that we see this face and that we hear this voice, it is these notions that we rediscover, that we listen to. Undoubtedly, in the Swann that they had constituted, my parents had omitted out of ignorance to include a host of particularities of his social life which were the cause that other people, when they were in his presence, saw the elegances reign in his face and stop at his hooked nose as at their natural border; but also they had been able to pile up in that face disaffected by its prestige, vacant and spacious, in the depths of those devalued eyes, the vague and soft residue – half memory, half oblivion – of the idle hours spent together after our weekly dinners, around at the gaming table or in the garden, during our life as good country neighbours. Our friend's bodily envelope had been so stuffed with it, as well as with a few memories relating to his parents, that this Swann had become a complete and living being, and that I have the impression of leaving a person for going towards another which is distinct from it, when, in my memory, from the Swann whom I knew later with exactness, I pass to this first Swann - to this first Swann in which I find the charming errors of my youth, and who moreover resembles the other less than the people I knew at the same time, as if it were our life as well as a museum where all the portraits of the same time have a family resemblance, the same tone – to this first Swann filled with leisure, perfumed by the smell of the large chestnut tree, baskets of raspberries and a sprig of tarragon.","They did not hesitate to send him off in search of it when they needed a recipe for gribiche sauce or pineapple salad for large dinners to which they had not invited him, believing he did not have sufficient prestige for one to be able to serve him up to acquaintances who were coming for the first time. If the conversation turned to the princes of the House of France: “people you and I will never know, will we, and we can manage quite well without that, can’t we,” my great-aunt would say to Swann, who had, perhaps, a letter from Twickenham9 in his pocket; she had him push the piano around and turn the pages on the evenings when my grandmother’s sister sang, handling this creature, who was elsewhere so sought after, with the naive roughness of a child who plays with a collector ’s curio no more carefully than with some object of little value. No doubt the Swann who was known at the same time to so many clubmen was quite different from the one created by my great-aunt, when in the evening, in the little garden at Combray, after the two hesitant rings of the bell had sounded, she injected and invigorated with all that she knew about the Swann family the dark and uncertain figure who emerged, followed by my grandmother, from a background of shadows, and whom we recognized by his voice. But even with respect to the most insignificant things in life, none of us constitutes a material whole, identical for everyone, which a person has only to go look up as though we were a book of specifications or a last testament; our social personality is a creation of the minds of others. Even the very simple act that we call “seeing a person we know” is in part an intellectual one. We fill the physical appearance of the individual we see with all the notions we have about him, and of the total picture that we form for ourselves, these notions certainly occupy the greater part. In the end they swell his cheeks so perfectly, follow the line of his nose in an adherence so exact, they do so well at nuancing the sonority of his voice as though the latter were only a transparent envelope that each time we see this face and hear this voice, it is these notions that we encounter again, that we hear. No doubt, in the Swann they had formed for themselves, my family had failed out of ignorance to include a host of details from his life in the fashionable world that caused other people, when they were in his presence, to see refinements rule his face and stop at his aquiline nose as though at their natural frontier; but they had also been able to garner in this face disaffected of its prestige, vacant and spacious, in the depths of these depreciated eyes, the vague, sweet residue— half memory, half forgetfulness—of the idle hours spent together after our weekly dinners, around the card table or in the garden, during our life of good country neighborliness. The corporeal envelope of our friend had been so well stuffed with all this, as well as with a few memories relating to his parents, that this particular Swann had become a complete and living being, and I have the impression of leaving one person to go to another distinct from him, when, in my memory, I pass from the Swann I knew later with accuracy to that first Swann—to that first Swann in whom I rediscover the charming mistakes of my youth and who in fact resembles less the other Swann than he resembles the other people I knew at the time, as though one’s life were like a museum in which all the portraits from one period have a family look about them, a single tonality—to that first Swann abounding in leisure, fragrant with the smell of the tall chestnut tree, the baskets of raspberries, and a sprig of tarragon.","It seemed quite natural, therefore, to send to him whenever we wanted a recipe for some special sauce or for a pineapple salad for one of our big dinner-parties, to which he himself would not be invited, not seeming of sufficient importance to be served up to new friends who might be in our house for the first time. If the conversation turned upon the Princes of the House of France, ""Gentlemen, you and I will never know, will we, and don't want to, do we?"" my great-aunt would say tartly to Swann, who had, perhaps, a letter from Twickenham in his pocket; she would make him play accompaniments and turn over music on evenings when my grandmother's sister sang; manipulating this creature, so rare and refined at other times and in other places, with the rough simplicity of a child who will play with some curio from the cabinet no more carefully than if it were a penny toy. Certainly the Swann who was a familiar figure in all the clubs of those days differed hugely from, the Swann created in my great-aunt's mind when, of an evening, in our little garden at Combray, after the two shy peals had sounded from the gate, she would vitalise, by injecting into it everything she had ever heard about the Swann family, the vague and unrecognisable shape which began to appear, with my grandmother in its wake, against a background of shadows, and could at last be identified by the sound of its voice. But then, even in the most insignificant details of our daily life, none of us can be said to constitute a material whole, which is identical for everyone, and need only be turned up like a page in an account-book or the record of a will; our social personality is created by the thoughts of other people. Even the simple act which we describe as ""seeing some one we know"" is, to some extent, an intellectual process. We pack the physical outline of the creature we see with all the ideas we have already formed about him, and in the complete picture of him which we compose in our minds those ideas have certainly the principal place. In the end they come to fill out so completely the curve of his cheeks, to follow so exactly the line of his nose, they blend so harmoniously in the sound of his voice that these seem to be no more than a transparent envelope, so that each time we see the face or hear the voice it is our own ideas of him which we recognise and to which we listen. And so, no doubt, from the Swann they had built up for their own purposes my family had left out, in their ignorance, a whole crowd of the details of his daily life in the world of fashion, details by means of which other people, when they met him, saw all the Graces enthroned in his face and stopping at the line of his arched nose as at a natural frontier; but they contrived also to put into a face from which its distinction had been evicted, a face vacant and roomy as an untenanted house, to plant in the depths of its unvalued eyes a lingering sense, uncertain but not unpleasing, half-memory and half-oblivion, of idle hours spent together after our weekly dinners, round the card-table or in the garden, during our companionable country life. Our friend's bodily frame had been so well lined with this sense, and with various earlier memories of his family, that their own special Swann had become to my people a complete and living creature; so that even now I have the feeling of leaving some one I know for another quite different person when, going back in memory, I pass from the Swann whom I knew later and more intimately to this early Swann— this early Swann in whom I can distinguish the charming mistakes of my childhood, and who, incidentally, is less like his successor than he is like the other people I knew at that time, as though one's life were a series of galleries in which all the portraits of any one period had a marked family likeness, the same (so to speak) tonality— this early Swann abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent of the great chestnut-tree, of baskets of raspberries and of a sprig of tarragon."
"C’était lui qui parlait pour elle. Je crois surtout que, confusément, ma grand’mère trouvait au clocher de Combray ce qui pour elle avait le plus de prix au monde, l’air naturel et l’air distingué. Ignorante en architecture, elle disait : « Mes enfants, moquez-vous de moi si vous voulez, il n’est peut-être pas beau dans les règles, mais sa vieille figure bizarre me plaît. Je suis sûre que s’il jouait du piano, il ne jouerait pas sec. » Et en le regardant, en suivant des yeux la douce tension, l’inclinaison fervente de ses pentes de pierre qui se rapprochaient en s’élevant comme des mains jointes qui prient, elle s’unissait si bien à l’effusion de la flèche, que son regard semblait s’élancer avec elle ; et en même temps elle souriait amicalement aux vieilles pierres usées dont le couchant n’éclairait plus que le faîte et qui, à partir du moment où elles entraient dans cette zone ensoleillée, adoucies par la lumière, paraissaient tout d’un coup montées bien plus haut, lointaines, comme un chant repris « en voix de tête » une octave au-dessus.","It was he who spoke for her. Above all, I believe that, confusedly, my grandmother found in the steeple of Combray what was for her the most precious in the world, the natural air and the air of distinction. Ignorant in architecture, she said: “My children, laugh at me if you want, he may not be handsome in the rules, but his strange old face pleases me. I'm sure if he played the piano, he wouldn't play straight. And looking at it, following with her eyes the gentle tension, the fervent inclination of its stone slopes which approached each other as they rose like clasped praying hands, she united herself so well with the outpouring of the spire. , that her gaze seemed to soar with her; and at the same time she smiled amicably at the old, worn stones, the setting sun of which only lit up the summit and which, from the moment they entered this sunny zone, softened by the light, suddenly seemed to rise much higher. high, distant, like a song repeated “in the head voice” an octave above.","It was the steeple that spoke for it. I believe above all that, confusedly, my grandmother found in the steeple of Combray what for her had the highest value in the world, an air of naturalness and an air of distinction. Knowing nothing about architecture, she would say: “My children, make fun of me if you like, perhaps it isn’t beautiful according to the rules, but I like its strange old face. I’m sure that if it could play the piano it would not play dryly.” And looking at it, following with her eyes the gentle tension, the fervent inclination of its slopes of stone, which approached each other as they rose like hands meeting in prayer, she would join so fully in the effusion of the spire that her gaze seemed to soar with it; and at the same time she would smile in a friendly way at the worn old stones, of which the setting sun now illuminated only the topmost part and which, the moment they entered that sunny region, softened by the light, appeared suddenly to have risen much higher, to be quite far away, like a song taken up again in “a head voice” an octave above.","It was the steeple which spoke for the church. I think, too, that in a confused way my grandmother found in the steeple of Combray what she prized above anything else in the world, namely, a natural air and an air of distinction. Ignorant of architecture, she would say: ""My dears, laugh at me if you like; it is not conventionally beautiful, but there is something in its quaint old face which pleases me. If it could play the piano, I am sure it would really play."" And when she gazed on it, when her eyes followed the gentle tension, the fervent inclination of its stony slopes which drew together as they rose, like hands joined in prayer, she would absorb herself so utterly in the outpouring of the spire that her gaze seemed to leap upwards with it; her lips at the same time curving in a friendly smile for the worn old stones of which the setting sun now illumined no more than the topmost pinnacles, which, at the point where they entered that zone of sunlight and were softened and sweetened by it, seemed to have mounted suddenly far higher, to have become truly remote, like a song whose singer breaks into falsetto, an octave above the accompanying air."
"– Tiens, c’est amusant, je n’avais jamais fait attention ; je vous dirai que je n’aime pas beaucoup chercher la petite bête et m’égarer dans des pointes d’aiguille ; on ne perd pas son temps à couper les cheveux en quatre ici, ce n’est pas le genre de la maison, répondit MmeVerdurin, que le docteur Cottard regardait avec une admiration béate et un zèle studieux se jouer au milieu de ce flot d’expressions toutes faites. D’ailleurs lui et MmeCottard, avec une sorte de bon sens comme en ont aussi certaines gens du peuple, se gardaient bien de donner une opinion ou de feindre l’admiration pour une musique qu’ils s’avouaient l’un à l’autre, une fois rentrés chez eux, ne pas plus comprendre que la peinture de « M. Biche ». Comme le public ne connaît du charme, de la grâce, des formes de la nature que ce qu’il en a puisé dans les poncifs d’un art lentement assimilé, et qu’un artiste original commence par rejeter ces poncifs, M. et MmeCottard, image en cela du public, ne trouvaient ni dans la sonate de Vinteuil, ni dans les portraits du peintre, ce qui faisait pour eux l’harmonie de la musique et la beauté de la peinture. Il leur semblait quand le pianiste jouait la sonate qu’il accrochait au hasard sur le piano des notes que ne reliaient pas en effet les formes auxquelles ils étaient habitués, et que le peintre jetait au hasard des couleurs sur ses toiles. Quand, dans celles-ci, ils pouvaient reconnaître une forme, ils la trouvaient alourdie et vulgarisée (c’est-à-dire dépourvue de l’élégance de l’école de peinture à travers laquelle ils voyaient, dans la rue même, les êtres vivants), et sans vérité, comme si M. Biche n’eût pas su comment était construite une épaule et que les femmes n’ont pas les cheveux mauves.","– Well, it’s funny, I had never paid attention; I will tell you that I don't much like looking for the little beast and getting lost in needlepoints; You don't waste your time splitting your hair here, it's not the kind of house, replied Mme. ready-made expressions. Besides, he and Madame Cottard, with a kind of good sense like some common people also have, were careful not to give an opinion or to feign admiration for music that they confessed to each other. other, once back home, not understand more than the painting of ""M. Biche"". As the public only knows of the charm, of the grace, of the forms of nature what it has drawn from the clichés of a slowly assimilated art, and that an original artist begins by rejecting these clichés, M. and Madame Cottard, the image in this of the public, found neither in Vinteuil's sonata nor in the painter's portraits what made for them the harmony of music and the beauty of painting. It seemed to them when the pianist was playing the sonata that he was hanging notes at random on the piano that did not in fact connect the forms to which they were accustomed, and that the painter was throwing colors at random on his canvases. When, in these, they could recognize a form, they found it weighed down and vulgarized (that is to say devoid of the elegance of the school of painting through which they saw, in the street itself, the living beings), and without truth, as if M. Biche had not known how a shoulder was built and that women do not have purple hair.","“Well now, that’s funny, I never paid any attention. I’ll tell you, I don’t very much enjoy nitpicking or discussing fine points; we don’t waste our time splitting hairs here , it’s not that kind of a house,” while Dr. Cottard watched her with blissful admiration and scholarly zeal as she frolicked in this billow of stock expressions. He and Mme. Cottard, however, with a kind of good sense which is also possessed by certain people from humble backgrounds, carefully refrained from offering an opinion or feigning admiration for a sort of music which they confessed to each other, once they were back home, they did not understand any more than the painting of “Monsieur Biche.” Since, of the charm, the grace, the forms of nature, the public knows only what it has absorbed from the clichés of an art slowly assimilated, and since an original artist begins by rejecting these clichés, M. and Mme. Cottard, being in this sense typical of the public, found neither in Vinteuil’s sonata, nor in the painter’s portraits, what for them created the harmony of music and the beauty of painting. It seemed to them when the pianist played the sonata that he was randomly attaching to the piano notes that were not in fact connected to the forms they were used to, and that the painter was randomly hurling colors onto his canvases. When they were able to recognize a form in these canvases, they found it heavy and vulgarized (that is, lacking the elegance of the school of painting through which they viewed all living creatures, even in the street), and lacking truth, as if Monsieur Biche did not know how a shoulder was constructed or that women do not have lavender hair.","Even to one or two particular remarks made by Swann on his favourite phrase, ""D'you know, that's a funny thing; I had never noticed it; I may as well tell you that I don't much care about peering at things through a microscope, and pricking myself on pin-points of difference; no; we don't waste time splitting hairs in this house; why not? well, it's not a habit of ours , that's all,"" Mme. Verdurin replied, while Dr. Cottard gazed at her with open-mouthed admiration, and yearned to be able to follow her as she skipped lightly from one stepping-stone to another of her stock of ready-made phrases. Both he, however, and Mme. Cottard, with a kind of common sense which is shared by many people of humble origin, would always take care not to express an opinion, or to pretend to admire a piece of music which they would confess to each other, once they were safely at home, that they no more understood than they could understand the art of 'Master' Biche. Inasmuch as the public cannot recognise the charm, the beauty, even the outlines of nature save in the stereotyped impressions of an art which they have gradually assimilated, while an original artist starts by rejecting those impressions, so M. and Mme. Cottard, typical, in this respect, of the public, were incapable of finding, either in Vinteuil's sonata or in Biche's portraits, what constituted harmony, for them, in music or beauty in painting. It appeared to them, when the pianist played his sonata, as though he were striking haphazard from the piano a medley of notes which bore no relation to the musical forms to which they themselves were accustomed, and that the painter simply flung the colours haphazard upon his canvas. When, on one of these, they were able to distinguish a human form, they always found it coarsened and vulgarised (that is to say lacking all the elegance of the school of painting through whose spectacles they themselves were in the habit of seeing the people—real, living people, who passed them in the streets) and devoid of truth, as though M. Biche had not known how the human shoulder was constructed, or that a woman's hair was not, ordinarily, purple."
"– Ç’a été d’abord un nom de victoire, princesse, dit le général. Qu’est-ce que vous voulez, pour un vieux briscard comme moi, ajouta-t-il en ôtant son monocle pour l’essuyer, comme il aurait changé un pansement, tandis que la princesse détournait instinctivement les yeux, cette noblesse d’Empire, c’est autre chose bien entendu, mais enfin, pour ce que c’est, c’est très beau dans son genre, ce sont des gens qui en somme se sont battus en héros.","""It was first a name of victory, princess,"" said the general. What do you want, for an old veteran like me, he added, taking off his monocle to wipe it, as he would have changed a bandage, while the princess instinctively averted her eyes, this nobility of Empire is something else of course, but in the end, for what it is, it's very beautiful in its genre, it's people who, in short, fought as heroes.","“Before that it was the name of a victory, Princesse,” said the general. “What do you expect—an old soldier like me,” he went on, removing his monocle and wiping it, as he would have changed a bandage, while the Princesse instinctively looked away. “ The nobility of the Empire, it’s different of course, but really, for what it is, it’s very fine of its kind. Those were men who fought, really, like heroes.”","""It was a battle before it was a bridge, Princess; it was a victory!"" said the General. ""I mean to say, to an old soldier like me,"" he went on, wiping his monocle and replacing it, as though he were laying a fresh dressing on the raw wound underneath, while the Princess instinctively looked away, ""that Empire nobility, well, of course, it's not the same thing, but, after all, taking it as it is, it's very fine of its kind; they were people who really did fight like heroes."""
"Sur le point de frapper contre les volets, il eut un moment de honte en pensant qu’Odette allait savoir qu’il avait eu des soupçons, qu’il était revenu, qu’il s’était posté dans la rue. Elle lui avait dit souvent l’horreur qu’elle avait des jaloux, des amants qui espionnent. Ce qu’il allait faire était bien maladroit, et elle allait le détester désormais, tandis qu’en ce moment encore, tant qu’il n’avait pas frappé, peut-être, même en le trompant, l’aimait-elle.

She had often told him of the horror she had of jealous people, of lovers who spy. What he was about to do was very clumsy, and she was going to hate him now, whereas even now, as long as he hadn't knocked, perhaps, even deceiving him, she loved him. How many possible happinesses the realization of which is thus sacrificed to the impatience of an immediate pleasure!","On the point of knocking on the shutters, he felt a pang of shame thinking that Odette was going to know he had been suspicious, that he had come back, that he had posted himself in the street.

What he was going to do would be extremely awkward, and she would detest him for ever after, whereas now, for the moment, for so long as he refrained from knocking, perhaps even in the act of infidelity, she loved him still.

"Sauf en lui demandant la petite phrase de Vinteuil au lieu de la Valse des Roses, Swann ne cherchait pas à lui faire jouer plutôt des choses qu’il aimât, et pas plus en musique qu’en littérature, à corriger son mauvais goût. Il se rendait bien compte qu’elle n’était pas intelligente. En lui disant qu’elle aimerait tant qu’il lui parlât des grands poètes, elle s’était imaginé qu’elle allait connaître tout de suite des couplets héroïques et romanesques dans le genre de ceux du vicomte de Borelli, en plus émouvant encore. Pour Ver Meer de Delft, elle lui demanda s’il avait souffert par une femme, si c’était une femme qui l’avait inspiré, et Swann lui ayant avoué qu’on n’en savait rien, elle s’était désintéressée de ce peintre. Elle disait souvent : « Je crois bien, la poésie, naturellement, il n’y aurait rien de plus beau si c’était vrai, si les poètes pensaient tout ce qu’ils disent. Mais bien souvent, il n’y a pas plus intéressé que ces gens-là. J’en sais quelque chose, j’avais une amie qui a aimé une espèce de poète. Dans ses vers il ne parlait que de l’amour, du ciel, des étoiles. Ah ! ce qu’elle a été refaite ! Il lui a croqué plus de trois cent mille francs. » Si alors Swann cherchait à lui apprendre en quoi consistait la beauté artistique, comment il fallait admirer les vers ou les tableaux, au bout d’un instant elle cessait d’écouter, disant : « Oui… je ne me figurais pas que c’était comme cela. » Et il sentait qu’elle éprouvait une telle déception qu’il préférait mentir en lui disant que tout cela n’était rien, que ce n’était encore que des bagatelles, qu’il n’avait pas le temps d’aborder le fond, qu’il y avait autre chose. Mais elle lui disait vivement : « Autre chose ? quoi ?… Dis-le alors », mais il ne le disait pas, sachant combien cela lui paraîtrait mince et différent de ce qu’elle espérait, moins sensationnel et moins touchant, et craignant que, désillusionnée de l’art, elle ne le fût en même temps de l’amour.","Except by asking him for the little phrase from Vinteuil instead of the Valse des Roses, Swann did not seek to make him play things he liked, and no more in music than in literature, to correct his bad taste. He knew she wasn't smart. Telling him that she would like him to talk to her about the great poets, she had imagined that she would immediately know heroic and romantic couplets like those of the Viscount de Borelli, only more moving. For Ver Meer de Delft, she asked him if he had suffered through a woman, if it was a woman who had inspired him, and Swann having confessed to her that no one knew anything about it, she had lost interest in this painter. She often said: “I think so, poetry, of course, there would be nothing more beautiful if it were true, if poets meant everything they said. But very often, there is no one more interested than these people. I know something about it, I had a friend who loved a kind of poet. In his verses he spoke only of love, of the sky, of the stars. Ah! what it has been redone! He took more than three hundred thousand francs from her. If then Swann tried to teach her what artistic beauty consisted of, how to admire poetry or paintings, after a moment she stopped listening, saying: ""Yes... I didn't imagine that it was was like that. And he felt that she felt such disappointment that he preferred to lie, telling her that it was all nothing, that it was still only trifles, that he had no time to broach the subject. background, that there was something else. But she said to him quickly: ""Anything else?"" what?… Say it then”, but he didn’t say it, knowing how thin and different it would seem to him, less sensational and less touching, and fearing that, disillusioned with art, she would was at the same time love.","Except when he asked her for the little phrase by Vinteuil instead of “The Waltz of the Roses,” Swann did not try to make her play things he liked or, any more in music than in literature, to correct her bad taste. He fully realized that she was not intelligent. When she told him she would like it so much if he would tell her about the great poets, she had imagined that she would immediately become familiar with heroic and romantic couplets like those by the Vicomte de Borelli,37 but even more moving. As for Vermeer of Delft, she asked if he had ever suffered because of a woman, if it was a woman who had inspired him, and when Swann admitted to her that no one knew anything about that, she lost interest in the painter. She often said: “I do believe, of course, that poetry—well, that there would be nothing more beautiful if it was true, if poets really believed everything they said. But quite often, those people are the most calculating of all. I know something about it, because a friend of mine was in love with a poet of sorts. In his poetry all he talked about was love, the sky, the stars. Oh, she was fooled all right! He did her out of more than three hundred thousand francs.” If Swann then tried to teach her what artistic beauty was, how one should admire poetry or painting, after a moment she would stop listening, saying: “Yes . . . I didn’t imagine it was like that.” And he would sense that she was feeling such disappointment that he would prefer to lie, telling her that what he had said was nothing, that it was the least important part, that he did not have the time to go into things more deeply, that there was something else. But she would say to him sharply: “Something else? What? . . . Say it, then,” but he would not say it, knowing it would seem feeble to her and different from what she was hoping for, less sensational and less touching, and fearing that, disillusioned by art, she would at the same time be disillusioned by love.","Except when he asked her for Vinteuil's little phrase instead of the Valse des Roses, Swann made no effort to induce her to play the things that he himself preferred, nor, in literature any more than in music, to correct the manifold errors of her taste. He fully realised that she was not intelligent. When she said how much she would like him to tell her about the great poets, she had imagined that she would suddenly get to know whole pages of romantic and heroic verse, in the style of the Vicomte de Borelli, only even more moving. As for Vermeer of Delft, she asked whether he had been made to suffer by a woman, if it was a woman that had inspired him, and once Swann had told her that no one knew, she had lost all interest in that painter. She would often say: ""I'm sure, poetry; well, of course, there'd be nothing like it if it was all true, if the poets really believed the things they said. But as often as not you'll find there's no one so mean and calculating as those fellows. I know something about poetry. I had a friend, once, who was in love with a poet of sorts. In his verses he never spoke of anything but love, and heaven, and the stars. Oh! she was properly taken in! He had more than three hundred thousand francs out of her before he'd finished. "" If, then, Swann tried to shew her in what artistic beauty consisted, how one ought to appreciate poetry or painting, after a minute or two she would cease to listen, saying: ""Yes... I never thought it would be like that."" And he felt that her disappointment was so great that he preferred to lie to her, assuring her that what he had said was nothing, that he had only touched the surface, that he had not time to go into it all properly, that there was more in it than that. Then she would interrupt with a brisk, ""More in it? What?... Do tell me!"" , but he did not tell her, for he realised how petty it would appear to her, and how different from what she had expected, less sensational and less touching; he was afraid, too, lest, disillusioned in the matter of art, she might at the same time be disillusioned in the greater matter of love."
"Et je recommence à me demander quel pouvait être cet état inconnu, qui n’apportait aucune preuve logique, mais l’évidence de sa félicité, de sa réalité devant laquelle les autres s’évanouissaient. Je veux essayer de le faire réapparaître. Je rétrograde par la pensée au moment où je pris la première cuillerée de thé. Je retrouve le même état, sans une clarté nouvelle. Je demande à mon esprit un effort de plus, de ramener encore une fois la sensation qui s’enfuit. Et, pour que rien ne brise l’élan dont il va tâcher de la ressaisir, j’écarte tout obstacle, toute idée étrangère, j’abrite mes oreilles et mon attention contre les bruits de la chambre voisine. Mais sentant mon esprit qui se fatigue sans réussir, je le force au contraire à prendre cette distraction que je lui refusais, à penser à autre chose, à se refaire avant une tentative suprême. Puis une deuxième fois, je fais le vide devant lui, je remets en face de lui la saveur encore récente de cette première gorgée et je sens tressaillir en moi quelque chose qui se déplace, voudrait s’élever, quelque chose qu’on aurait désancré, à une grande profondeur ; je ne sais ce que c’est, mais cela monte lentement ; j’éprouve la résistance et j’entends la rumeur des distances traversées.","And I begin to wonder again what this unknown state could be, which brought no logical proof, but the evidence of its bliss, of its reality before which the others fainted. I want to try to make it reappear. I backslide in thought as I take the first spoonful of tea. I find the same state again, without a new clarity. I ask my mind one more effort, to once again bring back the feeling that fled. And, so that nothing breaks the momentum with which he is going to try to recapture it, I push aside any obstacle, any foreign idea, I shield my ears and my attention from the noises of the adjoining room. But feeling my mind that is getting tired without succeeding, I force it on the contrary to take this distraction that I was refusing it, to think of something else, to recover before a supreme attempt. Then a second time, I create a void in front of him, I put back in front of him the still recent flavor of this first sip and I feel something quiver in me that moves, would like to rise, something that we would have unanchored , at great depth; I don't know what it is, but it is rising slowly; I feel the resistance and I hear the murmur of the distances crossed.","And I begin asking myself again what it could be, this unknown state which brought with it no logical proof, but only the evidence of its felicity, its reality, and in whose presence the other states of consciousness faded away.

"Mais rien ne ressemblait moins non plus à ce Balbec réel que celui dont j’avais souvent rêvé, les jours de tempête, quand le vent était si fort que Françoise en me menant aux Champs-Élysées me recommandait de ne pas marcher trop près des murs pour ne pas recevoir de tuiles sur la tête, et parlait en gémissant des grands sinistres et naufrages annoncés par les journaux. Je n’avais pas de plus grand désir que de voir une tempête sur la mer, moins comme un beau spectacle que comme un moment dévoilé de la vie réelle de la nature ; ou plutôt il n’y avait pour moi de beaux spectacles que ceux que je savais qui n’étaient pas artificiellement combinés pour mon plaisir, mais étaient nécessaires, inchangeables – les beautés des paysages ou du grand art. Je n’étais curieux, je n’étais avide de connaître que ce que je croyais plus vrai que moi-même, ce qui avait pour moi le prix de me montrer un peu de la pensée d’un grand génie, ou de la force ou de la grâce de la nature telle qu’elle se manifeste livrée à elle-même, sans l’intervention des hommes. De même que le beau son de sa voix, isolément reproduit par le phonographe, ne nous consolerait pas d’avoir perdu notre mère, de même une tempête mécaniquement imitée m’aurait laissé aussi indifférent que les fontaines lumineuses de l’Exposition. Je voulais aussi, pour que la tempête fût absolument vraie, que le rivage lui-même fût un rivage naturel, non une digue récemment créée par une municipalité. D’ailleurs la nature, par tous les sentiments qu’elle éveillait en moi, me semblait ce qu’il y avait de plus opposé aux productions mécaniques des hommes. Moins elle portait leur empreinte et plus elle offrait d’espace à l’expansion de mon cœur. Or j’avais retenu le nom de Balbec que nous avait cité Legrandin, comme d’une plage toute proche de « ces côtes funèbres, fameuses par tant de naufrages qu’enveloppent six mois de l’année le linceul des brumes et l’écume des vagues ».","But nothing resembled this real Balbec either less than the one I had often dreamed of, on stormy days, when the wind was so strong that Françoise, taking me to the Champs-Élysées, recommended that I not walk too close to the walls. so as not to receive tiles on his head, and spoke groaningly of the great disasters and shipwrecks announced by the newspapers. I had no greater desire than to see a storm on the sea, less as a beautiful spectacle than as an unveiled moment of the real life of nature; or rather there were for me no beautiful sights except those which I knew were not artificially contrived for my pleasure, but were necessary, unchangeable – the beauties of landscapes or of great art. I was only curious, I was only eager to know what I believed to be truer than myself, what had for me the price of showing me a little of the thought of a great genius, or of the strength or the grace of nature as it manifests itself left to itself, without the intervention of men. Just as the beautiful sound of her voice, reproduced in isolation by the phonograph, would not console us for having lost our mother, so a mechanically imitated storm would have left me as indifferent as the luminous fountains of the Exhibition. I also wanted, so that the storm was absolutely real, that the shore itself was a natural shore, not a dike recently created by a municipality. Besides, nature, by all the feelings it aroused in me, seemed to me to be the most opposed to the mechanical productions of men. The less it bore their imprint, the more space it offered for the expansion of my heart. Now I had remembered the name of Balbec, which Legrandin had quoted to us, as a beach very close to ""those funereal coasts, famous for so many shipwrecks that wrap six months of the year in the shroud of mist and the foam waves "".","But nothing resembled less this real Balbec, either, than the one I had often dreamed of, on stormy days, when the wind was so strong that Françoise as she took me to the Champs-Élysées warned me not to walk too close to the walls or the tiles might fall on my head and moaned to me about the great disasters and shipwrecks reported in the newspapers. I had no greater desire than to see a storm at sea, not so much because it would be a beautiful spectacle as because it would be a moment of nature’s real life unveiled; or rather for me there were no beautiful spectacles except the ones which I knew were not artificially contrived for my pleasure, but were necessary, unchangeable—the beauties of landscapes or of great art. I was curious, I was avid to know only those things which I believed to be more real than myself, which had for me the value of showing me a little of the mind of a great genius, or of the force or grace of nature as it is manifested when left to itself, without the interference of men. Just as the lovely sound of her voice, reproduced in isolation by the phonograph, would not console us for having lost our mother, so too a storm mechanically imitated would have left me as indifferent as the illuminated fountains at the Exposition.2 And so that the storm would be absolutely real, I also wanted the shore itself to be a natural shore, not a pier recently built by some municipality. In fact, because of all the feelings it awakened in me, nature seemed to me the thing most opposite to the mechanical productions of men. The less it bore their imprint the more room it offered in which my heart could expand. Now, I had remembered the name Balbec, which had been mentioned to us by Legrandin, as that of a seaside resort very close to “those funereal cliffs, famous for their many wrecks, wrapped six months of the year in a shroud of fog and the foam of the waves.”","And yet nothing could have differed more utterly, either, from the real Balbec than that other Balbec of which I had often dreamed, on stormy days, when the wind was so strong that Françoise, as she took me to the Champs-Elysées, would warn me not to walk too near the side of the street, or I might have my head knocked off by a falling slate, and would recount to me, with many lamentations, the terrible disasters and shipwrecks that were reported in the newspaper. I longed for nothing more than to behold a storm at sea, less as a mighty spectacle than as a momentary revelation of the true life of nature; or rather there were for me no mighty spectacles save those which I knew to be not artificially composed for my entertainment, but necessary and unalterable,—the beauty of landscapes or of great works of art. I was not curious, I did not thirst to know anything save what I believed to be more genuine than myself, what had for me the supreme merit of shewing me a fragment of the mind of a great genius, or of the force or the grace of nature as she appeared when left entirely to herself, without human interference. Just as the lovely sound of her voice, reproduced, all by itself, upon the phonograph, could never console a man for the loss of his mother, so a mechanical imitation of a storm would have left me as cold as did the illuminated fountains at the Exhibition. I required also, if the storm was to be absolutely genuine, that the shore from which I watched it should be a natural shore, not an embankment recently constructed by a municipality. Besides, nature, by all the feelings that she aroused in me, seemed to me the most opposite thing in the world to the mechanical inventions of mankind The less she bore their imprint, the more room she offered for the expansion of my heart. And, as it happened, I had preserved the name of Balbec, which Legrandin had cited to us, as that of a sea-side place in the very midst of ""that funereal coast, famed for the number of its wrecks, swathed, for six months in the year, in a shroud of fog and flying foam from the waves."
"Par cet amour Swann avait été tellement détaché de tous les intérêts, que quand par hasard il retournait dans le monde, en se disant que ses relations, comme une monture élégante qu’elle n’aurait pas d’ailleurs su estimer très exactement, pouvaient lui rendre à lui-même un peu de prix aux yeux d’Odette (et ç’aurait peut-être été vrai en effet si elles n’avaient été avilies par cet amour même, qui pour Odette dépréciait toutes les choses qu’il touchait par le fait qu’il semblait les proclamer moins précieuses), il y éprouvait, à côté de la détresse d’être dans des lieux, au milieu de gens qu’elle ne connaissait pas, le plaisir désintéressé qu’il aurait pris à un roman ou à un tableau où sont peints les divertissements d’une classe oisive ; comme, chez lui, il se complaisait à considérer le fonctionnement de sa vie domestique, l’élégance de sa garde-robe et de sa livrée, le bon placement de ses valeurs, de la même façon qu’à lire dans Saint-Simon, qui était un de ses auteurs favoris, la mécanique des journées, le menu des repas de Mme de Maintenon, ou l’avarice avisée et le grand train de Lulli. Et dans la faible mesure où ce détachement n’était pas absolu, la raison de ce plaisir nouveau que goûtait Swann, c’était de pouvoir émigrer un moment dans les rares parties de lui-même restées presque étrangères à son amour, à son chagrin. À cet égard, cette personnalité que lui attribuait ma grand’tante, de « fils Swann », distincte de sa personnalité plus individuelle de Charles Swann, était celle où il se plaisait maintenant le mieux.","By this love Swann had been so detached from all interests that when by chance he returned to the world, telling himself that his relations, like an elegant mount which she would not have been able to estimate very accurately, could give him a little value for himself in Odette's eyes (and that might indeed have been true if they had not been debased by that very love, which for Odette depreciated all the things he touched by the fact that he seemed to proclaim them less precious), he felt there, besides the distress of being in places, among people she did not know, the disinterested pleasure which he would have taken in a a novel or a picture depicting the amusements of an idle class; as, at home, he took pleasure in considering the functioning of his domestic life, the elegance of his wardrobe and his livery, the proper placement of his values, in the same way as reading in Saint-Simon, who was one of his favorite authors, the mechanics of the day, the meal menu of Madame de Maintenon, or the shrewd avarice and the grand train of Lulli. And to the small extent that this detachment was not absolute, the reason for this new pleasure that Swann tasted was to be able to emigrate for a moment to the rare parts of himself that had remained almost foreign to his love, to his grief. . In this respect, this personality attributed to him by my great-aunt, of ""son Swann"", distinct from his more individual personality of Charles Swann, was the one in which he now liked best.","By this love Swann had been so far detached from all other interests that, when by chance he reappeared in society telling himself that his connections, like an elegant setting that she would not in fact have been able to appreciate with much accuracy, could restore a little of his value in Odette’s eyes (and this would perhaps indeed have been true had these connections not been lowered in value by that love itself, which for Odette depreciated all the things it touched by seeming to proclaim them less precious), what he experienced there, along with the distress of being in places and among people whom she did not know, was the disinterested pleasure he would have taken in a novel or a painting which depicted the amusements of a leisured class, just as, in his own house, he enjoyed contemplating the functioning of his domestic life, the elegance of his wardrobe and livery, the proper placement of his stocks, in the same way that he enjoyed reading in Saint-Simon, who was one of his favorite authors, about the “mechanics” of the daily life, the menus of the dinners of Mme. de Maintenon,85 or the well-advised avarice and grand style of Lully.86 And to the small extent that this detachment was not absolute, the reason for this new pleasure that Swann was enjoying was that he could emigrate for a while into the rare parts of himself that had remained almost foreign to his love and to his pain. In this respect the personality which my great-aunt attributed to him, of “young Swann,” distinct from his more individual personality of Charles Swann, was the one in which he was now happiest.","By this love Swann had been so far detached from all other interests that when by chance he reappeared in the world of fashion, reminding himself that his social relations, like a beautifully wrought setting (although she would not have been able to form any very exact estimate of its worth), might, still, add a little to his own value in Odette's eyes (as indeed they might have done had they not been cheapened by his love itself, which for Odette depreciated everything that it touched by seeming to denounce such things as less precious than itself), he would feel there, simultaneously with his distress at being in places and among people that she did not know, the same detached sense of pleasure as he would have derived from a novel or a painting in which were depicted the amusements of a leisured class; just as, at home, he used to enjoy the thought of the smooth efficiency of his household, the smartness of his own wardrobe and of his servants' liveries, the soundness of his investments, with the same relish as when he read in Saint-Simon, who was one of his favourite authors, of the machinery of daily life at Versailles, what Mme. de Maintenon ate and drank, or the shrewd avarice and great pomp of Lulli. And in the small extent to which this detachment was not absolute, the reason for this new pleasure which Swann was tasting was that he could emigrate for a moment into those few and distant parts of himself which had remained almost foreign to his love and to his pain. In this respect the personality, with which my great-aunt endowed him, of 'young Swann,' as distinct from the more individual personality of Charles Swann, was that in which he now most delighted."
"Ainsi passait la vie pour ma tante Léonie, toujours identique, dans la douce uniformité de ce qu’elle appelait avec un dédain affecté et une tendresse profonde, son « petit traintrain ». Préservé par tout le monde, non seulement à la maison, où chacun ayant éprouvé l’inutilité de lui conseiller une meilleure hygiène, s’était peu à peu résigné à le respecter, mais même dans le village où, à trois rues de nous, l’emballeur, avant de clouer ses caisses, faisait demander à Françoise si ma tante ne « reposait pas » – ce traintrain fut pourtant troublé une fois cette année-là. Comme un fruit caché qui serait parvenu à maturité sans qu’on s’en aperçût et se détacherait spontanément, survint une nuit la délivrance de la fille de cuisine. Mais ses douleurs étaient intolérables, et comme il n’y avait pas de sage-femme à Combray, Françoise dut partir avant le jour en chercher une à Thiberzy. Ma tante, à cause des cris de la fille de cuisine, ne put reposer, et Françoise, malgré la courte distance, n’étant revenue que très tard, lui manqua beaucoup. Aussi, ma mère me dit-elle dans la matinée : « Monte donc voir si ta tante n’a besoin de rien. » J’entrai dans la première pièce et, par la porte ouverte, vis ma tante, couchée sur le côté, qui dormait ; je l’entendis ronfler légèrement. J’allais m’en aller doucement, mais sans doute le bruit que j’avais fait était intervenu dans son sommeil et en avait « changé la vitesse », comme on dit pour les automobiles, car la musique du ronflement s’interrompit une seconde et reprit un ton plus bas, puis elle s’éveilla et tourna à demi son visage que je pus voir alors ; il exprimait une sorte de terreur ; elle venait évidemment d’avoir un rêve affreux ; elle ne pouvait me voir de la façon dont elle était placée, et je restais là ne sachant si je devais m’avancer ou me retirer ; mais déjà elle semblait revenue au sentiment de la réalité et avait reconnu le mensonge des visions qui l’avaient effrayée ; un sourire de joie, de pieuse reconnaissance envers Dieu qui permet que la vie soit moins cruelle que les rêves, éclaira faiblement son visage, et avec cette habitude qu’elle avait prise de se parler à mi-voix à elle-même quand elle se croyait seule, elle murmura : « Dieu soit loué ! nous n’avons comme tracas que la fille de cuisine qui accouche. Voilà-t-il pas que je rêvais que mon pauvre Octave était ressuscité et qu’il voulait me faire faire une promenade tous les jours ! » Sa main se tendit vers son chapelet qui était sur la petite table, mais le sommeil recommençant ne lui laissa pas la force de l’atteindre : elle se rendormit, tranquillisée, et je sortis à pas de loup de la chambre sans qu’elle ni personne eût jamais appris ce que j’avais entendu.","That was how life went for my aunt Léonie, always the same, in the gentle uniformity of what she called with affected disdain and deep tenderness, her ""little routine"". Preserved by everyone, not only at home, where everyone having experienced the uselessness of advising him on better hygiene, had gradually resigned himself to respecting him, but even in the village where, three streets from us, the packer, before nailing up his cases, had Françoise ask if my aunt was not “resting” – this routine was nevertheless disturbed once that year. Like a hidden fruit that would have reached maturity without our noticing and would come off spontaneously, one night came the deliverance of the kitchen maid. But her pains were intolerable, and as there was no midwife at Combray, Françoise had to leave before daybreak to look for one at Thiberzy. My aunt, because of the cries of the kitchen maid, could not rest, and Françoise, despite the short distance, having only returned very late, missed her very much. Also, my mother said to me in the morning: “Go upstairs and see if your aunt needs anything. I entered the first room and, through the open door, saw my aunt, lying on her side, sleeping; I heard him snore lightly. I was going to go slowly, but no doubt the noise I had made had intervened in his sleep and had ""changed the speed"", as they say for automobiles, because the music of the snoring stopped for a second. and resumed a lower tone, then she awoke and half turned her face which I could then see; he expressed a kind of terror; she had evidently just had a dreadful dream; she could not see me the way she was placed, and I stood there not knowing whether to advance or withdraw; but already she seemed to have come back to the feeling of reality and had recognized the lie of the visions which had frightened her; a smile of joy, of pious gratitude to God who allows life to be less cruel than dreams, dimly lighted up her face, and with that habit she had acquired of talking to herself in an undertone when she believed alone, she murmured: “God be praised! we only have to worry about the kitchen girl who gives birth. Is it not that I was dreaming that my poor Octave was resurrected and that he wanted to take me for a walk every day! Her hand stretched out towards her rosary which was on the little table, but the onset of sleep again did not leave her the strength to reach it: she went back to sleep, reassured, and I crept out of the room without her no one would ever have learned what I had heard.","In this way life went on for my aunt Léonie, always the same, in the sweet uniformity of what she called, with affected disdain and deep tenderness, her “little routine.” Preserved by everyone, not only in the house, where we had all experienced the futility of advising her to adopt a better health regimen and so had gradually resigned ourselves to respecting the routine, but even in the village where, three streets away from us, the goods packer, before nailing his crates, would send word to ask Françoise if my aunt was “resting”—this routine was, however, disturbed once during that year. Like a hidden fruit that had ripened without anyone’s noticing and had dropped spontaneously, one night the kitchen maid gave birth. But her pains were intolerable, and since there was no midwife in Combray, Françoise had to go off before daybreak to find one in Thiberzy. My aunt could not rest because of the kitchen maid’s cries, and since Françoise, despite the short distance, did not come back until very late, my aunt missed her very much. And so my mother said to me in the course of the morning: “Go up, why don’t you, and see if your aunt needs anything.” I went into the first room, and through the open door saw my aunt lying on her side sleeping; I heard her snoring lightly. I was going to go away quietly, but the noise I had made had probably interfered with her sleep and made it “shift gears,” as they say about cars, because the music of her snoring broke off for a second and resumed on a lower note , then she woke up and half turned her face, which I could now see; it expressed a sort of terror; she had obviously just had a horrible dream; she could not see me the way she was positioned, and I stayed there not knowing if I should go in to her or leave; but already she seemed to have returned to a sense of reality and had recognized the falsity of the visions that had frightened her; a smile of joy, of pious gratitude to God who permits waking life to be less cruel than dreams, weakly illuminated her face, and in the habit she had formed of talking to herself half aloud when she thought she was alone, she murmured: “God be praised! Our only worry is the kitchen maid, who is having a baby. And here I’ve gone and dreamed that my poor Octave had come back to life and was trying to make me go for a walk every day!” Her hand went out toward her rosary, which lay on the little table, but sleep was overcoming her again and did not leave her the strength to reach it: she fell asleep, soothed, and I crept out of the room without her or anyone else ever finding out what I had heard.","In this way life went by for my aunt Léonie, always the same, in the gentle uniformity of what she called, with a pretence of deprecation but with a deep tenderness, her 'little jog-trot.' Respected by all and sundry, not merely in her own house, where every one of us, having learned the futility of recommending any healthier mode of life, had become gradually resigned to its observance, but in the village as well, where, three streets away, a tradesman who had to hammer nails into a packing-case would send first to Françoise to make sure that my aunt was not ' resting'—her 'little jog-trot' was, none the less, brutally disturbed on one occasion in this same year. Like a fruit hidden among its leaves, which has grown and ripened unobserved by man, until it falls of its own accord, there came upon us one night the kitchen-maid's confinement. Her pains were unbearable, and, as there was no midwife in Combray, Françoise had to set off before dawn to fetch one from Thiberzy. My aunt was unable to 'rest,' owing to the cries of the girl, and as Françoise, though the distance was nothing, was very late in returning, her services were greatly missed. And so, in the course of the morning, my mother said to me: ""Run upstairs, and see if your aunt wants anything."" I went into the first of her two rooms, and through the open door of the other saw my aunt lying on her side, asleep. I could hear her breathing, in what was almost distinguishable as a snore. I was just going to slip away when something, probably the sound of my entry, interrupted her sleep, and made it 'change speed,' as they say of motorcars nowadays, for the music of her snore broke off for a second and began again on a lower note; then she awoke, and half turned her face, which I could see for the first time; a kind of horror was imprinted on it; plainly she had just escaped from some terrifying dream. She could not see me from where she was lying, and I stood there not knowing whether I ought to go forward or to retire; but all at once she seemed to return to a sense of reality, and to grasp the falsehood of the visions that had terrified her; a smile of joy, a pious act of thanksgiving to God, Who is pleased to grant that life shall be less cruel than our dreams, feebly illumined her face, and, with the habit she had formed of speaking to herself, half-aloud, when she thought herself alone, she murmured: ""The Lord be praised! We have nothing to disturb us here but the kitchen-maid's baby. And I've been dreaming that my poor Octave had come back to life, and was trying to make me take a walk every day!"" She stretched out a hand towards her rosary, which was lying on the small table, but sleep was once again getting the mastery, and did not leave her the strength to reach it; she fell asleep, calm and contented, and I crept out of the room on tiptoe, without either her or anyone's else ever knowing, from that day to this, what I had seen and heard."

"Mais d’autres fois se mettait à tomber la pluie dont nous avait menacés le capucin que l’opticien avait à sa devanture ; les gouttes d’eau, comme des oiseaux migrateurs qui prennent leur vol tous ensemble, descendaient à rangs pressés du ciel. Elles ne se séparent point, elles ne vont pas à l’aventure pendant la rapide traversée, mais chacune tenant sa place attire à elle celle qui la suit et le ciel en est plus obscurci qu’au départ des hirondelles.","But other times the rain began to fall with which the Capuchin monk in the optician's window had threatened us; the drops of water, like migratory birds taking flight all together, descended in serried ranks from the sky. They do not separate, they do not go at random during the rapid crossing, but each taking her place attracts to her the one who follows her and the sky is darker than when the swallows left.","But at other times the rain with which we had been threatened by the little hooded monk in the optician’s window46 would begin to fall; the drops of water, like migrating birds which take flight all at the same time, would descend in close ranks from the sky. They do not separate at all, they do not wander away during their rapid course, but each one keeps to its place, drawing along the one that comes after it, and the sky is more darkened by them than when the swallows leave.","But on other days would begin to fall the rain, of which we had had due warning from the little barometer-figure which the spectacle-maker hung out in his doorway. Its drops, like migrating birds which fly off in a body at a given moment, would come down out of the sky in close marching order. They would never drift apart, would make no movement at random in their rapid course, but each one, keeping in its place, would draw after it the drop which was following, and the sky would be as greatly darkened as by the swallows flying south."
"Sans doute Swann était certain que s’il avait vécu maintenant loin d’Odette, elle aurait fini par lui devenir indifférente, de sorte qu’il aurait été content qu’elle quittât Paris pour toujours ; il aurait eu le courage de rester ; mais il n’avait pas celui de partir.","Doubtless Swann was certain that if he had now lived far from Odette, she would have ended by becoming indifferent to him, so that he would have been glad that she should leave Paris forever; he would have had the courage to stay; but he had no desire to leave.","No doubt Swann was sure that if he had now been living far away from Odette, she would in the end have become unimportant to him, so that he would have been glad if she had left Paris forever; he would have had the courage to stay there; but he did not have the courage to leave.","No doubt Swann was assured that if he had now been living at a distance from Odette he would gradually have lost all interest in her, so that he would have been glad to learn that she was leaving Paris for ever; he would have had the courage to remain there; but he had not the courage to go."

"Ce n’était pas seulement parce qu’une image dont nous rêvons reste toujours marquée, s’embellit et bénéficie du reflet des couleurs étrangères qui par hasard l’entourent dans notre rêverie ; car ces paysages des livres que je lisais n’étaient pas pour moi que des paysages plus vivement représentés à mon imagination que ceux que Combray mettait sous mes yeux, mais qui eussent été analogues. Par le choix qu’en avait fait l’auteur, par la foi avec laquelle ma pensée allait au-devant de sa parole comme d’une révélation, ils me semblaient être – impression que ne me donnait guère le pays où je me trouvais, et surtout notre jardin, produit sans prestige de la correcte fantaisie du jardinier que méprisait ma grand’mère – une part véritable de la Nature elle-même, digne d’être étudiée et approfondie.","It was not only because an image of which we dream always remains marked, embellishes and benefits from the reflection of the foreign colors which happen to surround it in our reverie; because these landscapes of the books that I read were for me only landscapes more vividly represented to my imagination than those that Combray put before my eyes, but which would have been analogous. By the choice that the author had made of them, by the faith with which my thought went ahead of his word as of a revelation, they seemed to me to be – an impression that the country where I was in hardly gave me, and above all our garden, an unglamorous product of the correct gardener's fancy that my grandmother despised – a real part of Nature itself, worthy of study and study.","This was not only because an image of which we dream remains forever stamped, is adorned and enriched, by the glimmer of the colors not its own that may happen to surround it in our daydream; for the landscapes in the books I read were for me not merely landscapes more vividly portrayed in my imagination than those which Combray set before my eyes but otherwise analogous. Because the author had chosen them, because of the faith with which my mind went to meet his word as though it were a revelation, they seemed to be—an impression hardly ever given me by the countryside in which I happened to be, and especially by our garden, the unmagical product of the perfectly correct conception of the gardener so despised by my grandmother—an actual part of Nature itself, worthy to be studied and explored.","This was not only because an image of which we dream remains for ever distinguished, is adorned and enriched by the association of colours not its own which may happen to surround it in our mental picture; for the scenes in the books I read were to me not merely scenery more vividly portrayed by my imagination than any which Combray could spread before my eyes but otherwise of the same kind. Because of the selection that the author had made of them, because of the spirit of faith in which my mind would exceed and anticipate his printed word, as it might be interpreting a revelation, these scenes used to give me the impression—one which I hardly ever derived from any place in which I might happen to be, and never from our garden, that undistinguished product of the strictly conventional fantasy of the gardener whom my grandmother so despised—of their being actually part of Nature herself, and worthy to be studied and explored."

"Quelquefois il espérait qu’elle mourrait sans souffrances dans un accident, elle qui était dehors, dans les rues, sur les routes, du matin au soir. Et comme elle revenait saine et sauve, il admirait que le corps humain fût si souple et si fort, qu’il pût continuellement tenir en échec, déjouer tous les périls qui l’environnent (et que Swann trouvait innombrables depuis que son secret désir les avait supputés), et permît ainsi aux êtres de se livrer chaque jour et à peu près impunément à leur œuvre de mensonge, à la poursuite du plaisir. Et Swann sentait bien près de son cœur ce Mahomet II dont il aimait le portrait par Bellini et qui, ayant senti qu’il était devenu amoureux fou d’une de ses femmes, la poignarda afin, dit naïvement son biographe vénitien, de retrouver sa liberté d’esprit.

And Swann felt very close to his heart that Mahomet II whose portrait he loved by Bellini and who, having felt that he had fallen madly in love with one of his wives, stabbed her in order, says his Venetian biographer naively, to regain his freedom of mind. Then he grew indignant at thinking thus only of himself, and the sufferings he had experienced seemed to him to deserve no pity, since he himself made such a cheap cut of Odette's life.","Sometimes he hoped she would die in an accident without suffering, she who was outside, in the streets, on the roads, from morning to night.

Quant au peintre il se réjouissait de l’introduction de Swann chez MmeVerdurin, parce qu’il le supposait amoureux d’Odette et qu’il aimait à favoriser les liaisons. « Rien ne m’amuse comme de faire des mariages, confia-t-il, dans l’oreille, au docteur Cottard, j’en ai déjà réussi beaucoup, même entre femmes ! »","When Mme Verdurin had announced that they would have M.

Who that, Swann! he yelled at the height of anxiety which suddenly eased when Madame Verdurin had said: ""But the friend Odette told us about."" – “Ah! good, good, I'm fine,” replied the appeased doctor. As for the painter, he rejoiced at Swann's introduction to Madame Verdurin, because he supposed him to be in love with Odette and liked to promote liaisons. “Nothing amuses me like making marriages, he confided, in the ear, to Doctor Cottard, I have already succeeded in many, even between women! »","When Mme.

And seeing that no one answered him, “Swann? Who’s this Swann?” he roared, filled with an anxiety that suddenly abated when Mme. Verdurin said: “Why, the friend Odette told us about.” “Ah, good, good! That’s all right then,” answered the doctor, pacified. As for the painter, he was delighted by the introduction of Swann to Mme. Verdurin ’s, because he assumed Swann was in love with Odette and he liked to encourage love affairs. “There’s nothing I enjoy more than arranging a marriage,” he confided in Dr. Cottard’s ear. “I’ve already managed a good many, even between women!”","When Mme.

And seeing that no one answered him, ""Swann! Who on earth is Swann?"" he shouted, in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided as soon as Mme. Verdurin had explained, ""Why, Odette's friend, whom she told us about."" ""Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,"" answered the Doctor, at once mollified. As for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of Swann's appearing at the Verdurins', because he supposed him to be in love with Odette, and was always ready to assist at lovers' meetings. "" Nothing amuses me more than match-making,"" he confided to Cottard; ""I have been tremendously successful, even with women!"""

"Tout le temps que j’étais loin de Gilberte, j’avais besoin de la voir, parce que cherchant sans cesse à me représenter son image, je finissais par ne plus y réussir, et par ne plus savoir exactement à quoi correspondait mon amour. Puis, elle ne m’avait encore jamais dit qu’elle m’aimait. Bien au contraire, elle avait souvent prétendu qu’elle avait des amis qu’elle me préférait, que j’étais un bon camarade avec qui elle jouait volontiers quoique trop distrait, pas assez au jeu ; enfin elle m’avait donné souvent des marques apparentes de froideur qui auraient pu ébranler ma croyance que j’étais pour elle un être différent des autres, si cette croyance avait pris sa source dans un amour que Gilberte aurait eu pour moi, et non pas, comme cela était, dans l’amour que j’avais pour elle, ce qui la rendait autrement résistante, puisque cela la faisait dépendre de la manière même dont j’étais obligé, par une nécessité intérieure, de penser à Gilberte. Mais les sentiments que je ressentais pour elle, moi-même je ne les lui avais pas encore déclarés. Certes, à toutes les pages de mes cahiers, j’écrivais indéfiniment son nom et son adresse, mais à la vue de ces vagues lignes que je traçais sans qu’elle pensât pour cela à moi, qui lui faisaient prendre autour de moi tant de place apparente sans qu’elle fût mêlée davantage à ma vie, je me sentais découragé parce qu’elles ne me parlaient pas de Gilberte qui ne les verrait même pas, mais de mon propre désir qu’elles semblaient me montrer comme quelque chose de purement personnel, d’irréel, de fastidieux et d’impuissant. Le plus pressé était que nous nous vissions, Gilberte et moi, et que nous puissions nous faire l’aveu réciproque de notre amour, qui jusque-là n’aurait pour ainsi dire pas commencé. Sans doute les diverses raisons qui me rendaient si impatient de la voir auraient été moins impérieuses pour un homme mûr. Plus tard, il arrive que devenus habiles dans la culture de nos plaisirs, nous nous contentions de celui que nous avons à penser à une femme comme je pensais à Gilberte, sans être inquiets de savoir si cette image correspond à la réalité, et aussi de celui de l’aimer sans avoir besoin d’être certain qu’elle nous aime ; ou encore que nous renoncions au plaisir de lui avouer notre inclination pour elle, afin d’entretenir plus vivace l’inclination qu’elle a pour nous, imitant ces jardiniers japonais qui, pour obtenir une plus belle fleur, en sacrifient plusieurs autres. Mais à l’époque où j’aimais Gilberte, je croyais encore que l’Amour existait réellement en dehors de nous ; que, en permettant tout au plus que nous écartions les obstacles, il offrait ses bonheurs dans un ordre auquel on n’était pas libre de rien changer ; il me semblait que si j’avais, de mon chef, substitué à la douceur de l’aveu la simulation de l’indifférence, je ne me serais pas seulement privé d’une des joies dont j’avais le plus rêvé, mais que je me serais fabriqué à ma guise un amour factice et sans valeur, sans communication avec le vrai, dont j’aurais renoncé à suivre les chemins mystérieux et préexistants.","All the time I was away from Gilberte, I needed to see her, because constantly trying to represent her image to myself, I ended up no longer succeeding, and no longer knowing exactly what my love corresponded to. Then, she had never told me that she loved me before. Quite the contrary, she had often pretended that she had friends whom she preferred me, that I was a good comrade with whom she liked to play although too distracted, not enough at play; finally she had often given me apparent marks of coldness which could have shaken my belief that I was for her a being different from the others, if this belief had taken its source in a love that Gilberte would have had for me, and not , as that was, in the love I had for her, what made her otherwise resistant, since it made her depend on the very way in which I was obliged, by an inner necessity, to think of Gilberte. But the feelings I felt for her, I myself had not yet declared them. Certainly, on all the pages of my notebooks, I wrote her name and her address indefinitely, but at the sight of these vague lines which I traced without her thinking of me for that, which made her take so many apparent place without her being more involved in my life, I felt discouraged because they did not speak to me of Gilberte who would not even see them, but of my own desire which they seemed to show me as something purely personal, unreal, tedious and impotent. The most urgent thing was for us to see each other, Gilberte and I, and to be able to make a reciprocal avowal of our love, which until then, so to speak, would not have begun. No doubt the various reasons which made me so impatient to see her would have been less compelling for a mature man. Later, it happens that, having become skilful in the cultivation of our pleasures, we content ourselves with the one we have to think of a woman as I thought of Gilberte, without being worried to know if this image corresponds to reality, and also to that of loving her without needing to be certain that she loves us; or even that we give up the pleasure of confessing our inclination for her, in order to keep the inclination she has for us more alive, imitating those Japanese gardeners who, to obtain a more beautiful flower, sacrifice several others. But at the time when I loved Gilberte, I still believed that Love really existed outside of us; that, by at most allowing us to remove the obstacles, it offered its happiness in an order in which we were not free to change anything; it seemed to me that if I had, on my own initiative, substituted for the sweetness of confession the simulation of indifference, I would not only have deprived myself of one of the joys of which I had most dreamed, but that I would have fabricated for myself as I pleased an artificial and valueless love, without communication with the true, whose mysterious and pre-existing paths I would have given up on.","All the time I was away from Gilberte, I needed to see her because, constantly trying to form a picture of her for myself, in the end I could not do it, and no longer knew precisely to what my love corresponded. And then she had never yet told me she loved me. Quite the contrary, she had often claimed there were boys she liked better than me, that I was a good enough friend she was always willing to play with, though too distracted, not involved enough in the game; finally, she had often given me apparent signs of coldness that might have shaken my belief that for her I was someone different from the others, if the source of that belief had been the love Gilberte might feel for me, and not, as was the case, the love I felt for her, which rendered it far more resistant, since this made it depend entirely on the manner in which I was obliged, by an inner necessity, to think of Gilberte. But the feelings I had for her, I myself had not yet declared to her. Certainly, on every page of my notebooks I copied out her name and address endlessly, but at the sight of those indeterminate lines which I wrote without inducing her to think any more about me because of that, which made her take up so much apparent space around me without being any more involved in my life, I felt discouraged because they spoke to me not of Gilberte, who would not even see them, but of my own desire, which they seemed to show me as something purely personal, unreal, tedious, and impotent. The most urgent thing was that we should see each other, Gilberte and I, and that we should be able to make a reciprocal avowal of our love, which until then would not so to speak have begun. No doubt the various reasons that made me so impatient to see her would have been less imperious for a grown man. When we are older, more skilled in the cultivation of our pleasures, we are sometimes content with the enjoyment of thinking about a woman as I thought about Gilberte, without worrying about whether that image corresponds to the reality, and also with the pleasure of loving her without needing to be certain that she loves us; or we forgo the pleasure of confessing our warm feelings for her, in order to encourage the hardiness of hers for us, imitating those Japanese gardeners who, to obtain one lovelier flower, sacrifice several others. But during the period when I loved Gilberte, I still believed that Love really existed outside of us; that, allowing us at the very most to remove obstacles in our way, it offered its joys in an order which we were not free to alter; it seemed to me that if I had, on my own initiative, substituted for the sweetness of confession the simulation of indifference, I would not only have deprived myself of one of the joys of which I had dreamed most often but that I would have fabricated for myself in my own way a love that was artificial and without value, without any connection to the real one, whose mysterious and preexisting paths I would have had to forgo following.","All the time that I was away from Gilberte, I wanted to see her, because, having incessantly sought to form a mental picture of her , I was unable, in the end, to do so, and did not know exactly to what my love corresponded. Besides, she had never yet told me that she loved me. Far from it, she had often boasted that she knew other little boys whom she preferred to myself, that I was a good companion, with whom she was always willing to play, although I was too absent-minded, not attentive enough to the game. Moreover, she had often shewn signs of apparent coldness towards me, which might have shaken my faith that I was for her a creature different from the rest, had that faith been founded upon a love that Gilberte had felt for me, and not, as was the case, upon the love that I felt for her, which strengthened its resistance to the assaults of doubt by making it depend entirely upon the manner in which I was obliged, by an internal compulsion, to think of Gilberte. But my feelings with regard to her I had never yet ventured to express to her in words. Of course, on every page of my exercise-books, I wrote out, in endless repetition, her name and address, but at the sight of those vague lines which I might trace, without her having to think, on that account, of me, I felt discouraged, because they spoke to me, not of Gilberte, who would never so much as see them, but of my own desire, which they seemed to shew me in its true colours, as something purely personal, unreal, tedious and ineffective. The most important thing was that we should see each other, Gilberte and I, and should have an opportunity of making a mutual confession of our love which, until then, would not officially (so to speak) have begun. Doubtless the various reasons which made me so impatient to see her would have appeared less urgent to a grown man. As life goes on, we acquire such adroitness in the culture of our pleasures, that we content ourselves with that which we derive from thinking of a woman, as I was thinking of Gilberte, without troubling ourselves to ascertain whether the image corresponds to the reality,—and with the pleasure of loving her, without needing to be sure, also, that she loves us; or again that we renounce the pleasure of confessing our passion for her, so as to preserve and enhance the passion that she has for us, like those Japanese gardeners who, to obtain one perfect blossom, will sacrifice the rest. But at the period when I was in love with Gilberte, I still believed that Love did really exist, apart from ourselves; that, allowing us, at the most, to surmount the obstacles in our way, it offered us its blessings in an order in which we were not free to make the least alteration; it seemed to me that if I had, on my own initiative, substituted for the sweetness of a confession a pretence of indifference, I should not only have been depriving myself of one of the joys of which I had most often dreamed, I should have been fabricating, of my own free will, a love that was artificial and without value, that bore no relation to the truth, whose mysterious and foreordained ways I should thus have been declining to follow."

"J’assignais la première place à la simplicité, dans l’ordre des mérites esthétiques et des grandeurs mondaines, quand j’apercevais Mme Swann à pied, dans une polonaise de drap, sur la tête un petit toquet agrémenté d’une aile de lophophore, un bouquet de violettes au corsage, pressée, traversant l’allée des Acacias comme si ç’avait été seulement le chemin le plus court pour rentrer chez elle et répondant d’un clin d’œil aux messieurs en voiture qui, reconnaissant de loin sa silhouette, la saluaient et se disaient que personne n’avait autant de chic. Mais au lieu de la simplicité, c’est le faste que je mettais au plus haut rang, si, après que j’avais forcé Françoise, qui n’en pouvait plus et disait que les jambes « lui rentraient », à faire les cent pas pendant une heure, je voyais enfin, débouchant de l’allée qui vient de la Porte Dauphine – image pour moi d’un prestige royal, d’une arrivée souveraine telle qu’aucune reine véritable n’a pu m’en donner l’impression dans la suite, parce que j’avais de leur pouvoir une notion moins vague et plus expérimentale – emportée par le vol de deux chevaux ardents, minces et contournés comme on en voit dans les dessins de Constantin Guys, portant établi sur son siège un énorme cocher fourré comme un cosaque, à côté d’un petit groom rappelant le « tigre » de « feu Baudenord », je voyais – ou plutôt je sentais imprimer sa forme dans mon cœur par une nette et épuisante blessure – une incomparable victoria, à dessein un peu haute et laissant passer à travers son luxe « dernier cri » des allusions aux formes anciennes, au fond de laquelle reposait avec abandon Mme Swann, ses cheveux maintenant blonds avec une seule mèche grise ceints d’un mince bandeau de fleurs, le plus souvent des violettes, d’où descendaient de longs voiles, à la main une ombrelle mauve, aux lèvres un sourire ambigu où je ne voyais que la bienveillance d’une Majesté et où il y avait surtout la provocation de la cocotte, et qu’elle inclinait avec douceur sur les personnes qui la saluaient. Ce sourire en réalité disait aux uns : « Je me rappelle très bien, c’était exquis ! » ; à d’autres : « Comme j’aurais aimé ! ç’a été la mauvaise chance ! » ; à d’autres : « Mais si vous voulez ! Je vais suivre encore un moment la file et dès que je pourrai, je couperai. » Quand passaient des inconnus, elle laissait cependant autour de ses lèvres un sourire oisif, comme tourné vers l’attente ou le souvenir d’un ami et qui faisait dire : « Comme elle est belle ! » Et pour certains hommes seulement elle avait un sourire aigre, contraint, timide et froid et qui signifiait : « Oui, rosse, je sais que vous avez une langue de vipère, que vous ne pouvez pas vous tenir de parler ! Est-ce que je m’occupe de vous, moi ! » Coquelin passait en discourant au milieu d’amis qui l’écoutaient et faisait avec la main, à des personnes en voiture, un large bonjour de théâtre. Mais je ne pensais qu’à Mme Swann et je faisais semblant de ne pas l’avoir vue, car je savais qu’arrivée à la hauteur du Tir aux pigeons elle dirait à son cocher de couper la file et de l’arrêter pour qu’elle pût descendre l’allée à pied. Et les jours où je me sentais le courage de passer à côté d’elle, j’entraînais Françoise dans cette direction. À un moment en effet, c’est dans l’allée des piétons, marchant vers nous que j’apercevais Mme Swann laissant s’étaler derrière elle la longue traîne de sa robe mauve, vêtue, comme le peuple imagine les reines, d’étoffes et de riches atours que les autres femmes ne portaient pas, abaissant parfois son regard sur le manche de son ombrelle, faisant peu attention aux personnes qui passaient, comme si sa grande affaire et son but avaient été de prendre de l’exercice, sans penser qu’elle était vue et que toutes les têtes étaient tournées vers elle. Parfois pourtant, quand elle s’était retournée pour appeler son lévrier, elle jetait imperceptiblement un regard circulaire autour d’elle.","I was assigning first place to simplicity, in the order of aesthetic merits and worldly greatness, when I saw Madame Swann on foot, in a cloth polo shirt, on her head a little cap embellished with a wing of lophophore. , a bouquet of violets on her bodice, in a hurry, crossing the Allée des Acacias as if it were only the shortest way to get home and winking at the gentlemen in the car who, recognizing from afar her silhouette, greeted her and said to themselves that no one had so much chic. But instead of simplicity, it was ostentation that I put in the highest rank, if, after I had forced Françoise, who couldn't take it any longer and said that her legs ""fit in"", to do the hundred not for an hour, I finally saw, coming out of the alley which comes from the Porte Dauphine - image for me of a royal prestige, of a sovereign arrival such as no true queen could give me the image of. impression in the sequel, because I had a less vague and more experimental notion of their power – carried away by the flight of two fiery horses, slender and contorted as one sees in the drawings of Constantin Guys, carrying established on his seat an enormous coachman stuffed like a Cossack, next to a little groom reminiscent of the ""tiger"" of ""the late Baudenord"", I saw - or rather I felt its shape imprinted in my heart by a clear and exhausting wound - an incomparable victoria, purposely a little high and letting hints through its ""state-of-the-art"" luxury with old forms, at the bottom of which rested with abandonment Madame Swann, her hair now blond with a single gray lock girded with a thin headband of flowers, most often violets, from which descended long veils, in her hand a mauve umbrella, on her lips an ambiguous smile in which I saw only the benevolence of a Majesty and where there was above all the provocation of the cocotte, and which she bowed gently to the people who greeted her. This smile actually said to some: “I remember very well, it was exquisite! » ; to others: “How I would have liked! it was bad luck! » ; to others: “But if you want! I'm going to follow the line for a while longer and as soon as I can, I'll cut. When strangers passed by, however, she left an idle smile around her lips, as if turned towards the expectation or the memory of a friend and which made people say: ""How beautiful she is!"" And for some men only she had a sour, constrained, shy and cold smile which meant: ""Yes, thug, I know you have a viper's tongue, that you can't stop talking!"" Am I taking care of you? Coquelin passed, talking in the midst of friends who were listening to him, and waved with his hand, to people in carriages, a broad theatrical hello. But I thought only of Madame Swann and I pretended not to have seen her, for I knew that when she reached the Tir aux Pigeons she would tell her coachman to cut the line and stop him so that she could walk down the aisle. And the days when I felt the courage to pass by her, I trained Françoise in this direction. At one point, in fact, it was in the pedestrian aisle, walking towards us, that I saw Madame Swann letting the long train of her mauve dress spread out behind her, dressed, as people imagine queens, in fabrics and rich finery that the other women did not wear, sometimes lowering her gaze to the handle of her parasol, paying little attention to people passing by, as if her main business and her object had been to take exercise, without to think she was seen and all heads were turned towards her. Sometimes, however, when she turned to call her greyhound, she cast an imperceptible glance around her.","I assigned the first place to simplicity, in the order of aesthetic merits and social grandeur, when I saw Mme. Swann on foot, wearing a cloth polonaise, on her head a little toque trimmed with a pheasant wing, a bouquet of violets at her bodice, hurrying down the allée des Acacias as if it were merely the shortest way to return home and answering with a wink the gentlemen in carriages who, recognizing her figure from far away, bowed to her and said to themselves that no one was as smart. But in place of simplicity, it was ostentation that I put on the highest rank, if, after I had forced Françoise, who was exhausted and said her legs were “folding up,” to walk back and forth for an hour, at last I would see, emerging from the avenue that comes from the Porte Dauphine—the picture for me of royal dignity, of a sovereign’s arrival, an impression such as no real queen has since been able to give me, because my notion of their power was less vague and more founded upon experience—borne along by two flying fiery horses as slender and smoothly turned as in the drawings of Constantin Guys,32 carrying an enormous coachman settled on his seat and wrapped in furs like a Cossack, next to a little groom who recalled the “tiger” of “the late Baudenord”33 I would see—or rather I would feel it imprint its form on my heart with a neat and exhausting wound—a matchless victoria, in its design a little high and with allusions to the old forms showing through its “dernier cri” opulence, in the depths of which Mme. Swann lay back carelessly, her hair now blond with a single gray lock and girded with a thin band of flowers, most often violets, from which descended long veils, in her hand a mauve parasol, on her lips an ambiguous smile in which I saw only the beneficence of a monarch and in which there was, more than anything else, a cocotte’s provocativeness, and which she inclined gently on the people who bowed to her. That smile in reality said to some of them: “I remember it very well—it was exquisite!”; to others: “How I would have loved to! What bad luck!” ; to others: “Why yes, if you like! I’ll stay in line for a moment longer and cut out as soon as I can.” When strangers passed, she would still allow an idle smile to linger around her lips, as though it were turned toward the expectation or the memory of a friend, which made people say: “How beautiful she is!” And for certain men only she had a smile that was sour, stiff, reticent, and cold, and meant: “Yes, you beast , I know you have the tongue of a viper, that you can’t keep from talking! But do I care about you? Do I?” Coquelin34 went past holding forth among a group of attentive friends, and with his hand gave a broad theatrical hello to the people in the carriages. But I was thinking only about Mme. Swann and I pretended I had not seen her yet, for I knew that once she drew level with the Tir aux Pigeons35 she would tell her coachman to cut out of the line and stop so that she could come back down the avenue on foot. And on the days when I felt I had the courage to pass close to her, I would drag Françoise in that direction. At a certain moment, in fact, in the footpath, walking toward us, I would see Mme. Swann letting the long train of her mauve dress spread out behind her, clothed, as the common people imagine queens, in fabrics and rich finery that other women did not wear, lowering her eyes now and then to the handle of her parasol, paying little attention to the people passing, as if her great business and her goal were to take some exercise, without thinking that she was being observed and that all heads were turned toward her. But now and then when she had looked back to call her greyhound, she would imperceptibly cast a circular gaze around her.","I assigned the first place, in the order of aesthetic merit and of social grandeur, to simplicity, when I saw Mme. Swann on foot, in a 'polonaise' of plain cloth, a little toque on her head trimmed with a pheasant's wing, a bunch of violets in her bosom, hastening along the Allée des Acacias as if it had been merely the shortest way back to her own house, and acknowledging with a rapid glance the courtesy of the gentlemen in carriages, who, recognising her figure at a distance, were raising their hats to her and saying to one another that there was never anyone so well turned out as she. But instead of simplicity it was to ostentation that I must assign the first place if, after I had compelled Françoise, who could hold out no longer, and complained that her legs were 'giving' beneath her, to stroll up and down with me for another hour, I saw at length, emerging from the Porte Dauphine, figuring for me a royal dignity, the passage of a sovereign, an impression such as no real Queen has ever since been able to give me, because my notion of their power has been less vague, and more founded upon experience—borne along by the flight of a pair of fiery horses, slender and shapely as one sees them in the drawings of Constantin Guys, carrying on its box an enormous coachman, furred like a cossack, and by his side a diminutive groom, like Toby, ""the late Beaudenord's tiger,"" I saw—or rather I felt its outlines engraved upon my heart by a clean and killing stab—a matchless victoria, built rather high, and hinting, through the extreme modernity of its appointments, at the forms of an earlier day, deep down in which lay negligently back Mme. Swann, her hair, now quite pale with one grey lock, girt with a narrow band of flowers, usually violets, from which floated down long veils, a lilac parasol in her hand, on her lips an ambiguous smile in which I read only the benign condescension of Majesty, though it was pre-eminently the enticing smile of the courtesan, which she graciously bestowed upon the men who bowed to her. That smile was, in reality, saying to one: ""Oh yes, I do remember, quite well; it was wonderful!"" to another: ""How I should have loved to! We were unfortunate!"", to a third: ""Yes, if you like! I must just keep in the line for a minute, then as soon as I can I will break away."" When strangers passed she still allowed to linger about her lips a lazy smile, as though she expected or remembered some friend, which made them say: ""What a lovely woman!"". And for certain men only she had a sour, strained, shy, cold smile which meant: ""Yes, you old goat , I know that you've got a tongue like a viper, that you can't keep quiet for a moment. But do you suppose that I care what you say? "" Coquelin passed, talking, in a group of listening friends, and with a sweeping wave of his hand bade a theatrical good day to the people in the carriages. But I thought only of Mme. Swann, and pretended to have not yet seen her, for I knew that, when she reached the pigeon-shooting ground, she would tell her coachman to 'break away' and to stop the carriage, so that she might come back on foot. And on days when I felt that I had the courage to pass close by her I would drag Françoise off in that direction; until the moment came when I saw Mme. Swann, letting trail behind her the long train of her lilac skirt, dressed, as the populace imagine queens to be dressed, in rich attire such as no other woman might wear, lowering her eyes now and then to study the handle of her parasol, paying scant attention to the passers-by, as though the important thing for her, her one object in being there, was to take exercise, without thinking that she was seen, and that every head was turned towards her. Sometimes, however, when she had looked back to call her dog to her, she would cast, almost imperceptibly, a sweeping glance round about."

Ma pauvre Françoise, je regrette de vous avoir fait monter pour rien.","""No, no, it's no longer worth it, it must be Mademoiselle Pupin.""

"Combien depuis ce jour, dans mes promenades du côté de Guermantes, il me parut plus affligeant encore qu’auparavant de n’avoir pas de dispositions pour les lettres, et de devoir renoncer à être jamais un écrivain célèbre. Les regrets que j’en éprouvais, tandis que je restais seul à rêver un peu à l’écart, me faisaient tant souffrir, que pour ne plus les ressentir, de lui-même par une sorte d’inhibition devant la douleur, mon esprit s’arrêtait entièrement de penser aux vers, aux romans, à un avenir poétique sur lequel mon manque de talent m’interdisait de compter. Alors, bien en dehors de toutes ces préoccupations littéraires et ne s’y rattachant en rien, tout d’un coup un toit, un reflet de soleil sur une pierre, l’odeur d’un chemin me faisaient arrêter par un plaisir particulier qu’ils me donnaient, et aussi parce qu’ils avaient l’air de cacher au delà de ce que je voyais, quelque chose qu’ils m’invitaient à venir prendre et que malgré mes efforts je n’arrivais pas à découvrir. Comme je sentais que cela se trouvait en eux, je restais là, immobile, à regarder, à respirer, à tâcher d’aller avec ma pensée au delà de l’image ou de l’odeur. Et s’il me fallait rattraper mon grand-père, poursuivre ma route, je cherchais à les retrouver, en fermant les yeux ; je m’attachais à me rappeler exactement la ligne du toit, la nuance de la pierre qui, sans que je pusse comprendre pourquoi, m’avaient semblé pleines, prêtes à s’entr’ouvrir, à me livrer ce dont elles n’étaient qu’un couvercle. Certes ce n’était pas des impressions de ce genre qui pouvaient me rendre l’espérance que j’avais perdue de pouvoir être un jour écrivain et poète, car elles étaient toujours liées à un objet particulier dépourvu de valeur intellectuelle et ne se rapportant à aucune vérité abstraite. Mais du moins elles me donnaient un plaisir irraisonné, l’illusion d’une sorte de fécondité et par là me distrayaient de l’ennui, du sentiment de mon impuissance que j’avais éprouvés chaque fois que j’avais cherché un sujet philosophique pour une grande œuvre littéraire. Mais le devoir de conscience était si ardu – que m’imposaient ces impressions de forme, de parfum ou de couleur – de tâcher d’apercevoir ce qui se cachait derrière elles, que je ne tardais pas à me chercher à moi-même des excuses qui me permissent de me dérober à ces efforts et de m’épargner cette fatigue. Par bonheur mes parents m’appelaient, je sentais que je n’avais pas présentement la tranquillité nécessaire pour poursuivre utilement ma recherche, et qu’il valait mieux n’y plus penser jusqu’à ce que je fusse rentré, et ne pas me fatiguer d’avance sans résultat.","How much since that day, in my walks near Guermantes, it seemed to me even more distressing than before to have no inclination for letters, and to have to give up ever being a famous writer. The regrets that I felt, while I remained alone dreaming a little apart, made me suffer so much, that in order not to feel them any more, of itself by a kind of inhibition in front of the pain, my spirit entirely stopped thinking about poetry, novels, a poetic future on which my lack of talent forbade me to count. So, well outside of all these literary preoccupations and in no way connected with them, suddenly a roof, a reflection of the sun on a stone, the smell of a path made me stop by a particular pleasure that they gave me, and also because they seemed to hide beyond what I saw, something that they invited me to come and take and that despite my efforts I couldn't manage to discover. As I felt that it was in them, I remained there, motionless, to look, to breathe, to try to go with my thought beyond the image or the smell. And if I had to catch up with my grandfather, continue on my way, I tried to find them, closing my eyes; I endeavored to remember exactly the line of the roof, the shade of the stone which, without my being able to understand why, had seemed full to me, ready to open up a little, to deliver to me what they were not. just a lid. Certainly it was not impressions of this kind that could restore to me the hope that I had lost of being able to one day be a writer and a poet, for they were always linked to a particular object devoid of intellectual value and not related to no abstract truth. But at least they gave me an irrational pleasure, the illusion of a kind of fruitfulness and thereby distracted me from the boredom, from the feeling of my helplessness that I had experienced each time I had sought a philosophical subject to a great literary work. But the duty of conscience was so arduous - imposed on me by these impressions of form, perfume or color - to try to see what was hidden behind them, that I was not long in seeking excuses for myself. which allow me to elude these efforts and save myself this fatigue. Luckily my parents called me, I felt that I did not currently have the tranquility necessary to pursue my research usefully, and that it was better not to think about it any more until I had returned, and not to to tire in advance without result.","How much more distressing still, after that day, during my walks along the Guermantes way, did it seem to me than it had seemed before to have no aptitude for literature, and to have to give up all hope of ever being a famous writer! The sorrow I felt over this, as I daydreamed alone, a little apart from the others, made me suffer so much that in order not to feel it anymore, my mind of its own accord, by a sort of inhibition in the face of pain, would stop thinking altogether about poems, novels, a poetic future on which my lack of talent forbade me to depend. Then, quite apart from all these literary preoccupations and not connected to them in any way, suddenly a roof, a glimmer of sun on a stone, the smell of the road would stop me because of a particular pleasure they gave me, and also because they seemed to be concealing, beyond what I could see, something which they were inviting me to come take and which despite my efforts I could not manage to discover. Since I felt that it could be found within them, I would stay there, motionless, looking, breathing, trying to go with my thoughts beyond the image or the smell. And if I had to catch up with my grandfather, continue on my way, I would try to find them again by closing my eyes; I would concentrate on recalling precisely the line of the roof, the shade of the stone which, without my being able to understand why, had seemed to me so full, so ready to open, to yield me the thing for which they themselves were merely a cover. Of course it was not impressions of this kind that could give me back the hope I had lost, of succeeding in becoming a writer and a poet someday, because they were always tied to a particular object with no intellectual value and no reference to any abstract truth. But at least they gave me an unreasoning pleasure, the illusion of a sort of fecundity, and so distracted me from the tedium, from the sense of my own impotence which I had felt each time I looked for a philosophical subject for a great literary work. But so arduous was the task imposed on my consciousness by the impressions I received from form, fragrance or color—to try to perceive what was concealed behind them—that I would soon look for excuses that would allow me to save myself from this effort and spare myself this fatigue. Fortunately, my parents would call me, I would feel I did not have the tranquillity I needed at the moment for pursuing my search in a useful way, and that it would be better not to think about it anymore until I was back at home, and not to fatigue myself beforehand to no purpose.","How often, after that day, in the course of my walks along the 'Guermantes way,' and with what an intensified melancholy did I reflect on my lack of qualification for a literary career, and that I must abandon all hope of ever becoming a famous author. The regret that I felt for this, while I lingered alone to dream for a little by myself, made me suffer so acutely that, in order not to feel it, my mind of its own accord, by a sort of inhibition in the instant of pain, ceased entirely to think of verse-making, of fiction, of the poetic future on which my want of talent precluded me from counting. Then, quite apart from all those literary preoccupations, and without definite attachment to anything, suddenly a roof, a gleam of sunlight reflected from a stone, the smell of a road would make me stop still, to enjoy the special pleasure that each of them gave me, and also because they appeared to be concealing, beneath what my eyes could see, something which they invited me to approach and seize from them, but which, despite all my efforts, I never managed to discover. As I felt that the mysterious object was to be found in them, I would stand there in front of them, motionless, gazing, breathing, endeavouring to penetrate with my mind beyond the thing seen or smelt. And if I had then to hasten after my grandfather, to proceed on my way, I would still seek to recover my sense of them by closing my eyes; I would concentrate upon recalling exactly the line of the roof, the colour of the stone, which, without my being able to understand why, had seemed to me to be teeming, ready to open, to yield up to me the secret treasure of which they were themselves no more than the outer coverings. It was certainly not any impression of this kind that could or would restore the hope I had lost of succeeding one day in becoming an author and poet, for each of them was associated with some material object devoid of any intellectual value, and suggesting no abstract truth. But at least they gave me an unreasoning pleasure, the illusion of a sort of fecundity of mind; and in that way distracted me from the tedium, from the sense of my own impotence which I had felt whenever I had sought a philosophic theme for some great literary work. So urgent was the task imposed on my conscience by these impressions of form or perfume or colour—to strive for a perception of what lay hidden beneath them, that I was never long in seeking an excuse which would allow me to relax so strenuous an effort and to spare myself the fatigue that it involved. As good luck would have it, my parents called me; I felt that I had not, for the moment, the calm environment necessary for a successful pursuit of my researches, and that it would be better to think no more of the matter until I reached home, and not to exhaust myself in the meantime to no purpose."
"Elle me regardait en souriant, mon oncle lui dit : « Mon neveu », sans lui dire mon nom, ni me dire le sien, sans doute parce que, depuis les difficultés qu’il avait eues avec mon grand-père, il tâchait autant que possible d’éviter tout trait d’union entre sa famille et ce genre de relations.","She looked at me smiling, my uncle said to her: ""My nephew"", without telling him my name, or telling me his, no doubt because, since the difficulties he had had with my grandfather, he tried so hard as possible to avoid any connection between his family and this kind of relationship.","She looked at me, smiling, my uncle said to her, “My nephew,” without telling her my name, or telling me hers, probably because, ever since the difficulties he had had with my grandfather, he had been trying as far as possible to avoid any association of his family with this sort of acquaintance.","She looked at me and smiled; my uncle said ""My nephew!"" without telling her my name or telling me hers, doubtless because, since his difficulties with my grandfather, he had endeavoured as far as possible to avoid any association of his family with this other class of acquaintance."
"Je ne me représentais pas alors les villes, les paysages, les monuments, comme des tableaux plus ou moins agréables, découpés çà et là dans une même matière, mais chacun d’eux comme un inconnu, essentiellement différent des autres, dont mon âme avait soif et qu’elle aurait profit à connaître. Combien ils prirent quelque chose de plus individuel encore, d’être désignés par des noms, des noms qui n’étaient que pour eux, des noms comme en ont les personnes. Les mots nous présentent des choses une petite image claire et usuelle comme celles que l’on suspend aux murs des écoles pour donner aux enfants l’exemple de ce qu’est un établi, un oiseau, une fourmilière, choses conçues comme pareilles à toutes celles de même sorte. Mais les noms présentent des personnes – et des villes qu’ils nous habituent à croire individuelles, uniques comme des personnes – une image confuse qui tire d’eux, de leur sonorité éclatante ou sombre, la couleur dont elle est peinte uniformément comme une de ces affiches, entièrement bleues ou entièrement rouges, dans lesquelles, à cause des limites du procédé employé ou par un caprice du décorateur, sont bleus ou rouges, non seulement le ciel et la mer, mais les barques, l’église, les passants. Le nom de Parme, une des villes où je désirais le plus aller, depuis que j’avais lu la Chartreuse, m’apparaissant compact, lisse, mauve et doux ; si on me parlait d’une maison quelconque de Parme dans laquelle je serais reçu, on me causait le plaisir de penser que j’habiterais une demeure lisse, compacte, mauve et douce, qui n’avait de rapport avec les demeures d’aucune ville d’Italie, puisque je l’imaginais seulement à l’aide de cette syllabe lourde du nom de Parme, où ne circule aucun air, et de tout ce que je lui avais fait absorber de douceur stendhalienne et du reflet des violettes. Et quand je pensais à Florence, c’était comme à une ville miraculeusement embaumée et semblable à une corolle, parce qu’elle s’appelait la cité des lys et sa cathédrale, Sainte-Marie-des-Fleurs. Quant à Balbec, c’était un de ces noms où comme sur une vieille poterie normande qui garde la couleur de la terre d’où elle fut tirée, on voit se peindre encore la représentation de quelque usage aboli, de quelque droit féodal, d’un état ancien de lieux, d’une manière désuète de prononcer qui en avait formé les syllabes hétéroclites et que je ne doutais pas de retrouver jusque chez l’aubergiste qui me servirait du café au lait à mon arrivée, me menant voir la mer déchaînée devant l’église et auquel je prêtais l’aspect disputeur, solennel et médiéval d’un personnage de fabliau.","I did not then imagine the cities, the landscapes, the monuments, as more or less pleasant paintings, cut out here and there in the same material, but each of them as an unknown, essentially different from the others, of which my soul had thirsty and that she would benefit from knowing. How they took on something even more individual, to be designated by names, names that were only for them, names like people have. Words present things to us, a small clear and usual image like those that are hung on the walls of schools to give children an example of what a workbench, a bird, an anthill is, things conceived as the same as all those of the same kind. But the names present people – and cities which they accustom us to believe to be individual, unique as people – a confused image which draws from them, from their bright or dark sonority, the color of which it is uniformly painted as one of these posters, entirely blue or entirely red, in which, because of the limits of the process employed or by a whim of the decorator, are blue or red, not only the sky and the sea, but the boats, the church, the passers-by. The name of Parma, one of the cities I most wanted to go to, ever since I had read the Chartreuse, seemed to me compact, smooth, mauve and soft; if they spoke to me of any house in Parma in which I would be received, they gave me the pleasure of thinking that I would live in a smooth, compact, mauve and soft dwelling, which had no connection with the dwellings of any city of Italy, since I imagined it only with the help of this heavy syllable of the name of Parma, where no air circulates, and of all that I had made it absorb of Stendhal's sweetness and the reflection of the violets. And when I thought of Florence, it was like a city miraculously fragrant and like a corolla, because it was called the city of lilies and its cathedral, Sainte-Marie-des-Fleurs. As for Balbec, it was one of those names in which, as on an old Norman pottery which retains the color of the earth from which it was drawn, one still sees depicted the representation of some abolished custom, of some feudal right, of an old state of affairs, in an obsolete way of pronouncing which had formed its heterogeneous syllables and which I had no doubt of finding even at the innkeeper who would serve me coffee with milk on my arrival, taking me to see the sea unleashed in front of the church and to which I lent the disputed, solemn and medieval aspect of a character from a fabliau.","I did not at the time represent to myself cities, landscapes, monuments as more or less pleasant pictures, cut out here and there from the same material, but each of them as an unknown thing, different in essence from the others, a thing for which my soul thirsted and which it would profit from knowing. How much more individuality still did they assume from being designated by names, names that were theirs alone, proper names like the names people have. Words present us with little pictures of things, clear and familiar, like those that are hung on the walls of schools to give children an example of what a workbench is, a bird, an anthill, things conceived of as similar to all others of the same sort. But names present a confused image of people—and of towns, which they accustom us to believe are individual, unique like people—an image which derives from them, from the brightness or darkness of their tone, the color with which it is painted uniformly, like one of those posters, entirely blue or entirely red, in which, because of the limitations of the process used or by a whim of the designer, not only the sky and the sea are blue or red, but the boats, the church, the people in the streets. Because the name of Parma, one of the towns I had most wanted to visit ever since I had read La Chartreuse,6 seemed to me compact, smooth, mauve, and soft, if anyone mentioned a certain house in Parma in which I would be staying, he gave me the pleasure of thinking I would be living in a house that was smooth, compact, mauve, and soft, that bore no relation to the houses of any real town in Italy, since I had composed it in my imagination with the help only of that heavy syllable, Parme, in which no air circulates, and of all that I had made it absorb of Stendhalian softness and the tint of violets. And when I thought of Florence, it was of a town miraculously fragrant and like the petals of a flower, because it was called the City of Lilies and its cathedral Saint-Mary-of-the-Flowers. As for Balbec, it was one of those names in which, as on a piece of old Norman pottery that retains the color of the earth from which it was taken, one can still see depicted the representation of some outmoded custom, of some feudal right, of some locality in an earlier condition, of an abandoned habit of pronunciation which had formed its heteroclite syllables and which I did not doubt I would rediscover spoken there even by the innkeeper who would serve me coffee with milk on my arrival, taking me down to watch the furious sea in front of the church, and to whom I would ascribe the disputatious, solemn, and medieval aspect of a character from a fabliau.7","I did not then represent to myself towns, landscapes, historic buildings, as pictures more or less attractive, cut out here and there of a substance that was common to them all, but looked on each of them as on an unknown thing, different from all the rest, a thing for which my soul was athirst, by the knowledge of which it would benefit. How much more individual still was the character that they assumed from being designated by names, names that were only for themselves, proper names such as people have. Words present to us little pictures of things, lucid and normal, like the pictures that are hung on the walls of schoolrooms to give children an illustration of what is meant by a carpenter's bench, a bird, an ant-hill; things chosen as typical of everything else of the same sort. But names present to us—of persons and of towns which they accustom us to regard as individual, as unique, like persons—a confused picture, which draws from the names, from the brightness or darkness of their sound, the colour in which it is uniformly painted, like one of those posters, entirely blue or entirely red, in which, on account of the limitations imposed by the process used in their reproduction, or by a whim on the designer's part, are blue or red not only the sky and the sea, but the ships and the church and the people in the streets. The name of Parma, one of the towns that I most longed to visit, after reading the Chartreuse, seeming to me compact and glossy, violet-tinted, soft, if anyone were to speak of such or such a house in Parma, in which I should be lodged, he would give me the pleasure of thinking that I was to inhabit a dwelling that was compact and glossy, violet-tinted, soft, and that bore no relation to the houses in any other town in Italy, since I could imagine it only by the aid of that heavy syllable of the name of Parma, in which no breath of air stirred, and of all that I had made it assume of Stendhalian sweetness and the reflected hue of violets. And when I thought of Florence, it was of a town miraculously embalmed, and flower-like, since it was called the City of the Lilies, and its Cathedral, Our Lady of the Flower. As for Balbec, it was one of those names in which, as on an old piece of Norman pottery that still keeps the colour of the earth from which it was fashioned, one sees depicted still the representation of some long-abolished custom, of some feudal right, of the former condition of some place, of an obsolete way of pronouncing the language, which had shaped and wedded its incongruous syllables and which I never doubted that I should find spoken there at once, even by the inn-keeper who would pour me out coffee and milk on my arrival, taking me down to watch the turbulent sea, unchained, before the church; to whom I lent the aspect, disputatious, solemn and mediaeval, of some character in one of the old romances."
"Et devant chaque maison, même celles où ce n’était pas l’habitude, les domestiques ou même les maîtres, assis et regardant, festonnaient le seuil d’un liséré capricieux et sombre comme celui des algues et des coquilles dont une forte marée laisse le crêpe et la broderie au rivage, après qu’elle s’est éloignée.","And in front of each house, even those where it was not the habit, the servants or even the masters, seated and watching, festooned the threshold with a capricious and dark border like that of seaweed and shells which a high tide leaves behind. the crepe and the embroidery on the shore, after she has gone away.","And in front of each house, even those where it was not the custom, the servants or even the masters, sitting and watching, would festoon the sill with a border as dark and irregular as the border of seaweed and shells whose crepe and embroidery are left on the shore by a strong tide after it recedes.","And in front of every house, even of those where it was not, as a rule, 'done,' the servants, and sometimes even the masters would sit and stare, festooning their doorsteps with a dark, irregular fringe, like the border of shells and sea-weed which a stronger tide than usual leaves on the beach, as though trimming it with embroidered crape, when the sea itself has retreated."
"Mais souvent les choses qu’il ne connaissait pas, qu’il redoutait maintenant de connaître, c’est Odette elle-même qui les lui révélait spontanément, et sans s’en rendre compte ; en effet l’écart que le vice mettait entre la vie réelle d’Odette et la vie relativement innocente que Swann avait cru, et bien souvent croyait encore, que menait sa maîtresse, cet écart, Odette en ignorait l’étendue : un être vicieux, affectant toujours la même vertu devant les êtres de qui il ne veut pas que soient soupçonnés ses vices, n’a pas de contrôle pour se rendre compte combien ceux-ci, dont la croissance continue est insensible pour lui-même, l’entraînent peu à peu loin des façons de vivre normales.","But often the things he didn't know, that he now dreaded knowing, it was Odette herself who revealed them to him spontaneously, and without realizing it; indeed the gap that vice put between Odette's real life and the relatively innocent life that Swann had believed, and very often still believed, that his mistress led, this gap, Odette did not know the extent of it: a vicious being , always affecting the same virtue before the beings of whom he does not want his vices to be suspected, has no control to realize how much these, whose continuous growth is insensible to himself, drag him down. gradually away from normal ways of life.","But often the things he did not know, that he now was afraid of knowing, were revealed spontaneously by Odette herself, and without her realizing it; in fact the distance that depravity put between Odette’s real life and the relatively innocent life which Swann had believed, and quite often still believed, his mistress led, was a distance whose extent Odette did not realize: a depraved person, still affecting the same virtue in front of the people by whom he does not want his vices to be suspected, has no gauge by which to recognize how far the latter, whose continuous growth is imperceptible to himself, are drawing him little by little away from normal ways of living.","But, often enough, the things that he did not know, that he dreaded, now, to learn, it was Odette herself who, spontaneously and without thought of what she did, revealed them to him; for the gap which her vices made between her actual life and the comparatively innocent life which Swann had believed, and often still believed his mistress to lead, was far wider than she knew. A vicious person, always affecting the same air of virtue before people whom he is anxious to keep from having any suspicion of his vices, has no register, no gauge at hand from which he may ascertain bow far those vices (their continuous growth being imperceptible by himself) have gradually segregated him from the normal ways of life."

Il lui paraît une rose. »,It looks like a rose to her. »,nose’Twill smell like a rose.”,"Although, when her grandson had a slight cold in his head, she would Bet off at night, even if she were ill also, instead of going to bed, to see whether he had everything that he wanted, covering ten miles on foot before daybreak so as to be in time to begin her work, this same love for her own people, and her desire to establish the future greatness of her house on a solid foundation reacted, in her policy with regard to the other servants, in one unvarying maxim, which was never to let any of them set foot in my aunt's room; indeed she shewed a sort of pride in not allowing anyone else to come near my aunt, preferring, when she herself was ill, to get out of bed and to administer the Vichy water in person, rather than to concede to the kitchen-maid the right of entry into her mistress's presence."

II,II,2,"Combray at a distance, from a twenty-mile radius, as we used to see it from the railway when we arrived there every year in Holy Week, was no more than a church epitomising the town, representing it, speaking of it and for it to the horizon, and as one drew near, gathering close about its long, dark cloak, sheltering from the wind, on the open plain, as a shepherd gathers his sheep, the woolly grey backs of its flocking houses, which a fragment of its mediaeval ramparts enclosed, here and there, in an outline as scrupulously circular as that of a little town in a primitive painting."

For Swann as for them, it was the novelty of his language that made one believe in the darkness of his intentions.","There are authors of true originality in whom the least boldness offends because they have not first flattered the tastes of the public and have not served it the commonplaces which it is used to; it was in the same way that Swann roused M. Verdurin’s indignation. In Swann’s case as in theirs, it was the novelty of his language that convinced one of the darkness of his intentions.","There are certain original and distinguished authors in whom the least 'freedom of speech' is thought revolting because they have not begun by flattering the public taste, and serving up to it the commonplace expressions to which it is used; it was by the same process that Swann infuriated M. Verdurin. In his case as in theirs it was the novelty of his language which led his audience to suspect the blackness of his designs."

"En dehors de la jeune femme du docteur, ils étaient réduits presque uniquement cette année-là (bien que MmeVerdurin fût elle-même vertueuse et d’une respectable famille bourgeoise excessivement riche et entièrement obscure avec laquelle elle avait peu à peu cessé toute relation) à une personne presque du demi-monde, Mme de Crécy, que MmeVerdurin appelait par son petit nom, Odette, et déclarait être « un amour », et à la tante du pianiste, laquelle devait avoir tiré le cordon ; personnes ignorantes du monde et à la naïveté de qui il avait été si facile de faire accroire que la princesse de Sagan et la duchesse de Guermantes étaient obligées de payer des malheureux pour avoir du monde à leurs dîners, que si on leur avait offert de les faire inviter chez ces deux grandes dames, l’ancienne concierge et la cocotte eussent dédaigneusement refusé.","Apart from the doctor's young wife, they were reduced almost solely in that year (although Madame Verdurin was herself virtuous and from a respectable, excessively wealthy and entirely obscure bourgeois family with which she had gradually ceased all relations) to a person almost from the demi-monde, Madame de Crécy, whom Madame Verdurin called by her middle name, Odette, and declared to be ""a love,"" and to the pianist's aunt, who must have pulled the cord; people ignorant of the world and to whose naivety it had been so easy to make people believe that the Princesse de Sagan and the Duchesse de Guermantes were obliged to pay unfortunate people to have people at their dinners, that if they had been offered to to invite the former concierge and the casserole to these two great ladies would have disdainfully refused.","Apart from the doctor’s young wife, they were reduced almost exclusively that year (even though Mme. Verdurin herself was virtuous and from a respectable bourgeois family, an extremely rich and entirely obscure one with which she had by degrees and of her own accord ceased to have any contact) to a person almost of the demimonde, Mme. de Crécy, whom Mme. Verdurin called by her first name, Odette, and declared to be “a love,” and to the pianist’s aunt, who must once have been employed as a caretaker; both of them being women ignorant of the world whom, in their naïveté, it had been so easy to delude into believing that the Princesse de Sagan and the Duchesse de Guermantes were obliged to pay certain poor wretches in order to have any guest at their dinners, that if you had offered to get them invitations to the homes of these two great ladies, the former concierge and the cocotte would disdainfully have refused.","Apart from the doctor's young wife, they were reduced almost exclusively that season (for all that Mme. Verdurin herself was a thoroughly 'good' woman, and came of a respectable middle-class family, excessively rich and wholly undistinguished, with which she had gradually and of her own accord severed all connection) to a young woman almost of a 'certain class,' a Mme. de Crécy, whom Mme. Verdurin called by her Christian name, Odette, and pronounced a 'love,' and to the pianist's aunt, who looked as though she had, at one period, 'answered the bell': ladies quite ignorant of the world, who in their social simplicity were so easily led to believe that the Princesse de Sagan and the Duchesse de Guermantes were obliged to pay large sums of money to other poor wretches, in order to have anyone at their dinner-parties, that if somebody had offered to procure them an invitation to the house of either of those great dames, the old doorkeeper and the woman of 'easy virtue' would have contemptuously declined."
"Puis l’habitude qu’il avait eue longtemps du monde, du luxe, lui en avait donné, en même temps que le dédain, le besoin, de sorte qu’à partir du moment où les réduits les plus modestes lui étaient apparus exactement sur le même pied que les plus princières demeures, ses sens étaient tellement accoutumés aux secondes qu’il eût éprouvé quelque malaise à se trouver dans les premiers. Il avait la même considération – à un degré d’identité qu’ils n’auraient pu croire – pour des petits bourgeois qui faisaient danser au cinquième étage d’un escalier D, palier à gauche, que pour la princesse de Parme qui donnait les plus belles fêtes de Paris ; mais il n’avait pas la sensation d’être au bal en se tenant avec les pères dans la chambre à coucher de la maîtresse de la maison, et la vue des lavabos recouverts de serviettes, des lits transformés en vestiaires, sur le couvre-pied desquels s’entassaient les pardessus et les chapeaux lui donnait la même sensation d’étouffement que peut causer aujourd’hui à des gens habitués à vingt ans d’électricité l’odeur d’une lampe qui charbonne ou d’une veilleuse qui file.","Then the habit he had had for a long time of the world, of luxury, had given him, at the same time as the disdain, the need for it, so that from the moment when the most modest recesses had appeared to him exactly on on the same footing as the most princely dwellings, his senses were so accustomed to the second that he would have felt some uneasiness at finding himself in the first. He had the same consideration – to a degree of identity they could not have believed – for petty bourgeois who made people dance on the fifth floor of a staircase D, landing on the left, as for the Princess of Parma who gave the most beautiful parties in Paris; but he didn't feel like he was at the ball standing with the fathers in the mistress of the house's bedroom, and the sight of the washbasins covered with towels, the beds turned into dressing rooms, on the coverlet foot of which the overcoats and hats were piled up gave him the same feeling of suffocation that the smell of a burning lamp or a spinning pilot can cause today in people accustomed to twenty years of electricity. .","Also, his long habit of society, of luxury, had given him, at the same time as a disdain for them, a need for them, so that by the time he had come to regard the most modest houses as exactly on a par with the most princely, his senses were so accustomed to the latter that he experienced some indisposition at finding himself in the former. He had the same esteem—identical to a degree they could not have believed—for a petit bourgeois family which asked him up to a dance on the fifth floor, Stairway D, left at the landing, as for the Princess of Parma, who gave the finest parties in Paris; but he did not have the feeling of being actually at a ball while standing with the fathers in the bedroom of the mistress of the house and the sight of the washstands covered with towels, of the beds, transformed into cloakrooms, their coverlets piled with overcoats and hats, gave him the same stifling sensation that people today who are used to twenty years of electricity may experience at the smell of a lamp blackening or a night-light smoking.","Besides, he had been used for so long to the refinement and comfort of good society that, side by side with his contempt, there had grown up also a desperate need for it, with the result that, when he had reached the point after which the humblest lodgings appeared to him as precisely on a par with the most princely mansions, his senses were so thoroughly accustomed to the latter that he could not enter the former without a feeling of acute discomfort. He had the same regard—to a degree of identity which they would never have suspected—for the little families with small incomes who asked him to dances in their flats (""straight upstairs to the fifth floor, and the door on the left"") as for the Princesse de Parme, who gave the most splendid parties in Paris; but he had not the feeling of being actually 'at the ball' when he found himself herded with the fathers of families in the bedroom of the lady of the house, while the spectacle of wash-hand-stands covered over with towels, and of beds converted into cloak-rooms, with a mass of hats and great-coats sprawling over their counterpanes, gave him the same stifling sensation that, nowadays, people who have been used for half a lifetime to electric light derive from a smoking lamp or a candle that needs to be snuffed."

"Parfois à l’exaltation que me donnait la solitude, s’en ajoutait une autre que je ne savais pas en départager nettement, causée par le désir de voir surgir devant moi une paysanne que je pourrais serrer dans mes bras. Né brusquement, et sans que j’eusse eu le temps de le rapporter exactement à sa cause, au milieu de pensées très différentes, le plaisir dont il était accompagné ne me semblait qu’un degré supérieur de celui qu’elles me donnaient. Je faisais un mérite de plus à tout ce qui était à ce moment-là dans mon esprit, au reflet rose du toit de tuile, aux herbes folles, au village de Roussainville où je désirais depuis longtemps aller, aux arbres de son bois, au clocher de son église, de cet émoi nouveau qui me les faisait seulement paraître plus désirables parce que je croyais que c’était eux qui le provoquaient, et qui semblait ne vouloir que me porter vers eux plus rapidement quand il enflait ma voile d’une brise puissante, inconnue et propice. Mais si ce désir qu’une femme apparût ajoutait pour moi aux charmes de la nature quelque chose de plus exaltant, les charmes de la nature, en retour, élargissaient ce que celui de la femme aurait eu de trop restreint. Il me semblait que la beauté des arbres c’était encore la sienne, et que l’âme de ces horizons, du village de Roussainville, des livres que je lisais cette année-là, son baiser me la livrerait ; et mon imagination reprenant des forces au contact de ma sensualité, ma sensualité se répandant dans tous les domaines de mon imagination, mon désir n’avait plus de limites.","Sometimes to the exaltation that solitude gave me was added another that I did not know how to distinguish clearly, caused by the desire to see a peasant woman appear in front of me whom I could hug. Born suddenly, and without my having had time to relate it exactly to its cause, in the midst of very different thoughts, the pleasure with which it was accompanied seemed to me only a higher degree than that which they gave me. I gave one more merit to everything that was in my mind at that moment, to the pink reflection of the tiled roof, to the wild grasses, to the village of Roussainville where I had long wanted to go, to the trees of its wood, to the steeple of his church, of this new excitement which only made them seem more desirable to me because I believed that they were the ones who provoked it, and which seemed only to want to carry me towards them more quickly when he inflated my sail with a powerful, unknown and auspicious breeze. But if this desire for a woman to appear added to the charms of nature for me something more exalting, the charms of nature, in return, enlarged what that of the woman would have been too restricted. It seemed to me that the beauty of the trees was still hers, and that the soul of these horizons, of the village of Roussainville, of the books I was reading that year, her kiss would deliver it to me; and my imagination regaining strength in contact with my sensuality, my sensuality spreading in all areas of my imagination, my desire had no limits.","Sometimes the exhilaration I felt at being alone was joined by another kind that I was not able to separate distinctly from it, and that came from my desire to see a peasant girl appear in front of me whom I could clasp in my arms. Born suddenly, and without my having had time to identify exactly what had caused it, from among very different thoughts, the pleasure which accompanied it seemed to me only one degree higher than that which those other thoughts had given me. Everything that was in my mind at that moment acquired an even greater value, the pink reflection of the tile roof, the wild grass, the village of Roussainville to which I had been wanting to go for so long now, the trees of its woods, the steeple of its church, as a result of this new emotion which made them appear more desirable only because I thought it was they that had provoked it, and which seemed only to wish to carry me toward them more rapidly when it filled my sail with a powerful, mysterious, and propitious wind. But if, for me, this desire that a woman should appear added something more exhilarating to the charms of nature, the charms of nature, in return, broadened what would have been too narrow in the woman’s charm. It seemed to me that the beauty of the trees was also hers and that the soul of those horizons, of the village of Roussainville, of the books I was reading that year, would be given to me by her kiss; and as my imagination drew strength from contact with my sensuality, as my sensuality spread through all the domains of my imagination, my desire grew boundless.","Sometimes to the exhilaration which I derived from being alone would be added an alternative feeling, so that I could not be clear in my mind to which I should give the casting vote; a feeling stimulated by the desire to see rise up before my eyes a peasant-girl whom I might clasp in my arms. Coming abruptly, and without giving me time to trace it accurately to its source among so many ideas of a very different kind, the pleasure which accompanied this desire seemed only a degree superior to what was given me by my other thoughts. I found an additional merit in everything that was in my mind at the moment, in the pink reflection of the tiled roof, the wild grass in the wall, the village of Roussainville into which I had long desired to penetrate, the trees of its wood and the steeple of its church, created in them by this fresh emotion which made them appear more desirable only because I thought it was they that had provoked it, and which seemed only to wish to bear me more swiftly towards them when it filled my sails with a potent, unknown, and propitious breeze. But if this desire that a woman should appear added for me something more exalting than the charms of nature, they in their turn enlarged what I might, in the woman's charm, have found too much restricted. It seemed to me that the beauty of the trees was hers also, and that, as for the spirit of those horizons, of the village of Roussainville, of the books which I was reading that year, it was her kiss which would make me master of them all; and, my imagination drawing strength from contact with my sensuality, my sensuality expanding through all the realms of my imagination, my desire had no longer any bounds."

"Si mes parents m’avaient permis, quand je lisais un livre, d’aller visiter la région qu’il décrivait, j’aurais cru faire un pas inestimable dans la conquête de la vérité. Car si on a la sensation d’être toujours entouré de son âme, ce n’est pas comme d’une prison immobile : plutôt on est comme emporté avec elle dans un perpétuel élan pour la dépasser, pour atteindre à l’extérieur, avec une sorte de découragement, entendant toujours autour de soi cette sonorité identique qui n’est pas écho du dehors, mais retentissement d’une vibration interne. On cherche à retrouver dans les choses, devenues par là précieuses, le reflet que notre âme a projeté sur elles ; on est déçu en constatant qu’elles semblent dépourvues dans la nature, du charme qu’elles devaient, dans notre pensée, au voisinage de certaines idées ; parfois on convertit toutes les forces de cette âme en habileté, en splendeur pour agir sur des êtres dont nous sentons bien qu’ils sont situés en dehors de nous et que nous ne les atteindrons jamais. Aussi, si j’imaginais toujours autour de la femme que j’aimais les lieux que je désirais le plus alors, si j’eusse voulu que ce fût elle qui me les fît visiter, qui m’ouvrît l’accès d’un monde inconnu, ce n’était pas par le hasard d’une simple association de pensée ; non, c’est que mes rêves de voyage et d’amour n’étaient que des moments – que je sépare artificiellement aujourd’hui comme si je pratiquais des sections à des hauteurs différentes d’un jet d’eau irisé et en apparence immobile – dans un même et infléchissable jaillissement de toutes les forces de ma vie.","If my parents had allowed me, when I was reading a book, to visit the region it described, I would have thought I was taking an invaluable step in the conquest of truth. Because if we have the feeling of being always surrounded by our soul, it is not like an immobile prison: rather we are carried away with it in a perpetual impulse to go beyond it, to reach outside, with a kind of discouragement, always hearing around you this identical sonority which is not an echo from outside, but the reverberation of an internal vibration. We seek to find in things, which have thereby become precious, the reflection that our soul has projected onto them; we are disappointed in noting that they seem devoid in nature of the charm which they owed, in our thought, to the neighborhood of certain ideas; sometimes we convert all the forces of this soul into skill, into splendor to act on beings which we feel are situated outside of us and which we will never reach. Also, if I always imagined around the woman I loved the places I wanted the most then, if I had wanted it to be her who showed me them, who gave me access to a world unknown, it was not by the chance of a simple association of thought; no, it's that my dreams of travel and love were only moments – which I artificially separate today as if I practiced sections at different heights of an iridescent and seemingly motionless jet of water – in a single and inflexible outpouring of all the forces of my life.","If my parents had allowed me, when I was reading a book, to go visit the region it described, I would have believed I was taking an invaluable step forward in the conquest of truth. For even if we have the sensation of being always surrounded by our own soul, it is not as though by a motionless prison: rather, we are in some sense borne along with it in a perpetual leap to go beyond it, to reach the outside, with a sort of discouragement as we hear around us always that same resonance, which is not an echo from outside but the resounding of an internal vibration. We try to rediscover in things, now precious because of it, the glimmer that our soul projected on them; we are disappointed to find that they seem to lack in nature the charm they derived in our thoughts from the proximity of certain ideas; at times we convert all the forces of that soul into cunning, into magnificence, in order to have an effect on people who are outside us, as we are well aware, and whom we will never reach. Thus, if I always imagined the woman I loved surrounded by the places I longed for most at that time, if I would have liked her to be the one who took me to visit them, who opened the way for me into an unknown world, it was not because of a simple chance association of thoughts; no, it was because my dreams of travel and of love were only moments—which I am separating artificially today as if I were cutting sections at different heights of an apparently motionless iridescent jet of water—in a single inflexible upsurge of all the forces of my life.","Had my parents allowed me, when I read a book, to pay a visit to the country it described, I should have felt that I was making an enormous advance towards the ultimate conquest of truth. For even if we have the sensation of being always enveloped in, surrounded by our own soul, still it does not seem a fixed and immovable prison; rather do we seem to be borne away with it, and perpetually struggling to pass beyond it, to break out into the world, with a perpetual discouragement as we hear endlessly, all around us, that unvarying sound which is no echo from without, but the resonance of a vibration from within. We try to discover in things, endeared to us on that account, the spiritual glamour which we ourselves have cast upon them; we are disillusioned, and learn that they are in themselves barren and devoid of the charm which they owed, in our minds, to the association of certain ideas; sometimes we mobilise all our spiritual forces in a glittering array so as to influence and subjugate other human beings who, as we very well know, are situated outside ourselves, where we can never reach them. And so, if I always imagined the woman I loved as in a setting of whatever places I most longed, at the time, to visit; if in my secret longings it was she who attracted me to them, who opened to me the gate of an unknown world, that was not by the mere hazard of a simple association of thoughts; no, it was because my dreams of travel and of love were only moments—which I isolate artificially to-day as though I were cutting sections, at different heights, in a jet of water, rainbow-flashing but seemingly without flow or motion—were only drops in a single, undeviating, irresistible outrush of all the forces of my life."
"Bientôt le cours de la Vivonne s’obstrue de plantes d’eau. Il y en a d’abord d’isolées comme tel nénufar à qui le courant au travers duquel il était placé d’une façon malheureuse laissait si peu de repos que, comme un bac actionné mécaniquement, il n’abordait une rive que pour retourner à celle d’où il était venu, refaisant éternellement la double traversée. Poussé vers la rive, son pédoncule se dépliait, s’allongeait, filait, atteignait l’extrême limite de sa tension jusqu’au bord où le courant le reprenait, le vert cordage se repliait sur lui-même et ramenait la pauvre plante à ce qu’on peut d’autant mieux appeler son point de départ qu’elle n’y restait pas une seconde sans en repartir par une répétition de la même manœuvre. Je la retrouvais de promenade en promenade, toujours dans la même situation, faisant penser à certains neurasthéniques au nombre desquels mon grand-père comptait ma tante Léonie, qui nous offrent sans changement au cours des années le spectacle des habitudes bizarres qu’ils se croient chaque fois à la veille de secouer et qu’ils gardent toujours ; pris dans l’engrenage de leurs malaises et de leurs manies, les efforts dans lesquels ils se débattent inutilement pour en sortir ne font qu’assurer le fonctionnement et faire jouer le déclic de leur diététique étrange, inéluctable et funeste. Tel était ce nénufar, pareil aussi à quelqu’un de ces malheureux dont le tourment singulier, qui se répète indéfiniment durant l’éternité, excitait la curiosité de Dante et dont il se serait fait raconter plus longuement les particularités et la cause par le supplicié lui-même, si Virgile, s’éloignant à grands pas, ne l’avait forcé à le rattraper au plus vite, comme moi mes parents.","Soon the course of the Vivonne is clogged with water plants. There are first of them isolated like such a water lily to which the current through which it was placed in an unfortunate way left so little rest that, like a mechanically operated ferry, it approached a bank only to return. to that from which he had come, eternally making the double crossing. Pushed towards the shore, its peduncle unfolded, lengthened, spun, reached the extreme limit of its tension until the edge where the current took it again, the green rope folded back on itself and brought the poor plant back to this that one can all the better call its point of departure that it did not remain there for a second without starting again by repeating the same manoeuvre. I met her from walk to walk, always in the same situation, reminiscent of certain neurasthenics, among whom my grandfather counted my aunt Léonie, who offer us, without change over the years, the spectacle of the bizarre habits they believe themselves to be. every time on the eve of shaking and they always keep; caught in the gears of their discomforts and their manias, the efforts in which they uselessly struggle to get out of them only ensure the functioning and trigger the click of their strange, ineluctable and disastrous dietetics. Such was this water lily, similar also to one of those unfortunate people whose singular torment, which repeats itself indefinitely during eternity, aroused Dante's curiosity and whose particularities and cause he would have been told at greater length by the victim. himself, if Virgil, striding away, hadn't forced him to catch up with him as quickly as possible, like me, my parents.","Soon the course of the Vivonne is obstructed by water plants. First they appear singly, like this water lily, for instance, which was allowed so little rest by the current in the midst of which it was unfortunately placed that, like a mechanically activated ferry boat, it would approach one bank only to return to the one from which it had come, eternally crossing back and forth again. Pushed toward the bank, its peduncle would unfold, lengthen, flow out, reach the extreme limit of its tension at the edge where the current would pick it up again, then the green cord would fold up on itself and bring the poor plant back to what may all the more properly be called its point of departure because it did not stay there a second without starting off from it again in a repetition of the same maneuver. I would find it again, walk after walk, always in the same situation, reminding me of certain neurasthenics among whose number my grandfather would count my aunt Léonie, who present year after year the unchanging spectacle of the bizarre habits they believe, each time, they are about to shake off and which they retain forever; caught in the machinery of their maladies and their manias, the efforts with which they struggle uselessly to abandon them only guarantee the functioning and activate the triggers of their strange, unavoidable, and morose regimes. This water lily was the same, and it was also like one of those miserable creatures whose singular torment, repeated indefinitely throughout eternity, aroused the curiosity of Dante, who would have asked the tormented creature himself to recount its cause and its particularities at greater length had Virgil, striding on ahead, not forced him to hurry after immediately, as my parents did me.","Presently the course of the Vivonne became choked with water-plants. At first they appeared singly, a lily, for instance, which the current, across whose path it had unfortunately grown, would never leave at rest for a moment, so that, like a ferry-boat mechanically propelled, it would drift over to one bank only to return to the other, eternally repeating its double journey. Thrust towards the bank, its stalk would be straightened out, lengthened, strained almost to breaking-point until the current again caught it, its green moorings swung back over their anchorage and brought the unhappy plant to what might fitly be called its starting-point, since it was fated not to rest there a moment before moving off once again. I would still find it there, on one walk after another, always in the same helpless state, suggesting certain victims of neurasthenia, among whom my grandfather would have included my aunt Léonie, who present without modification, year after year, the spectacle of their odd and unaccountable habits, which they always imagine themselves to be on the point of shaking off, but which they always retain to the end; caught in the treadmill of their own maladies and eccentricities, their futile endeavours to escape serve only to actuate its mechanism, to keep in motion the clockwork of their strange, ineluctable, fatal daily round. Such as these was the water-lily, and also like one of those wretches whose peculiar torments, repeated indefinitely throughout eternity, aroused the curiosity of Dante, who would have inquired of them at greater length and in fuller detail from the victims themselves, had not Virgil, striding on ahead, obliged him to hasten after him at full speed, as I must hasten after my parents."
"Après le dîner, hélas, j’étais bientôt obligé de quitter maman qui restait à causer avec les autres, au jardin s’il faisait beau, dans le petit salon où tout le monde se retirait s’il faisait mauvais. Tout le monde, sauf ma grand’mère qui trouvait que « c’est une pitié de rester enfermé à la campagne » et qui avait d’incessantes discussions avec mon père, les jours de trop grande pluie, parce qu’il m’envoyait lire dans ma chambre au lieu de rester dehors. « Ce n’est pas comme cela que vous le rendrez robuste et énergique, disait-elle tristement, surtout ce petit qui a tant besoin de prendre des forces et de la volonté. » Mon père haussait les épaules et il examinait le baromètre, car il aimait la météorologie, pendant que ma mère, évitant de faire du bruit pour ne pas le troubler, le regardait avec un respect attendri, mais pas trop fixement pour ne pas chercher à percer le mystère de ses supériorités. Mais ma grand’mère, elle, par tous les temps, même quand la pluie faisait rage et que Françoise avait précipitamment rentré les précieux fauteuils d’osier de peur qu’ils ne fussent mouillés, on la voyait dans le jardin vide et fouetté par l’averse, relevant ses mèches désordonnées et grises pour que son front s’imbibât mieux de la salubrité du vent et de la pluie. Elle disait : « Enfin, on respire ! » et parcourait les allées détrempées – trop symétriquement alignées à son gré par le nouveau jardinier dépourvu du sentiment de la nature et auquel mon père avait demandé depuis le matin si le temps s’arrangerait – de son petit pas enthousiaste et saccadé, réglé sur les mouvements divers qu’excitaient dans son âme l’ivresse de l’orage, la puissance de l’hygiène, la stupidité de mon éducation et la symétrie des jardins, plutôt que sur le désir inconnu d’elle d’éviter à sa jupe prune les taches de boue sous lesquelles elle disparaissait jusqu’à une hauteur qui était toujours pour sa femme de chambre un désespoir et un problème.","After dinner, alas, I was soon obliged to leave Mama who remained to chat with the others, in the garden if the weather was fine, in the little drawing-room where everyone retired if the weather was bad. Everyone, except my grandmother who thought that ""it's a pity to stay locked up in the country"" and who had incessant discussions with my father, on days when it rained too much, because he sent me read in my room instead of staying outside. ""That's not how you'll make him strong and energetic,"" she said sadly, ""especially this little one who needs so much strength and willpower."" My father shrugged his shoulders and examined the barometer, for he liked meteorology, while my mother, avoiding making noise so as not to disturb him, looked at it with tender respect, but not so fixedly as not to try to pierce the mystery of its superiorities. But my grandmother, she, in all weathers, even when the rain was raging and Françoise had hastily brought in the precious wicker armchairs for fear that they were wet, we saw her in the empty garden and whipped by the downpour, lifting up her messy gray locks so that her forehead would soak up the healthiness of the wind and the rain. She said: “Finally, we can breathe! and traversed the sodden paths – too symmetrically lined up for his liking by the new gardener, devoid of any sense of nature and to whom my father had asked since morning if the weather would improve – with his enthusiastic, jerky little steps, tuned to the various movements excited in her soul by the intoxication of the storm, the power of hygiene, the stupidity of my education and the symmetry of the gardens, rather than by the desire unknown to her to avoid her plum skirt the stains of mud under which she disappeared to a height that was always a despair and a problem for her maid.","After dinner, alas, I soon had to leave Mama, who stayed there talking with the others, in the garden if the weather was fine, in the little drawing room to which everyone withdrew if the weather was bad. Everyone, except my grandmother, who felt that “it’s a pity to shut oneself indoors in the country” and who had endless arguments with my father on days when it rained too heavily, because he sent me to read in my room instead of having me stay outdoors. “That’s no way to make him strong and active,” she would say sadly, “especially that boy, who so needs to build up his endurance and willpower.” My father would shrug his shoulders and study the barometer, for he liked meteorology, while my mother, making no noise so as not to disturb him, watched him with a tender respect, but not so intently as to try to penetrate the mystery of his superior qualities. But as for my grandmother, in all weathers, even in a downpour when Françoise had rushed the precious wicker armchairs indoors so that they would not get wet, we would see her in the empty, rain-lashed garden, pushing back her disordered gray locks so that her forehead could more freely drink in the salubriousness of the wind and rain. She would say: “At last, one can breathe!” and would roam the soaked paths—too symmetrically aligned for her liking by the new gardener, who lacked all feeling for nature and whom my father had been asking since morning if the weather would clear—with her jerky, enthusiastic little step, regulated by the various emotions excited in her soul by the intoxication of the storm, the power of good health, the stupidity of my upbringing, and the symmetry of the gardens, rather than by the desire, quite unknown to her, to spare her plum-colored skirt the spots of mud under which it would disappear up to a height that was always, for her maid, a source of despair and a problem.","But after dinner, alas, I was soon obliged to leave Mamma, who stayed talking with the others, in the garden if it was fine, or in the little parlour where everyone took shelter when it was wet. Everyone except my grandmother, who held that ""It is a pity to shut oneself indoors in the country,"" and used to carry on endless discussions with my father on the very wettest days, because he would send me up to my room with a book instead of letting me stay out of doors. ""That is not the way to make him strong and active,"" she would say sadly, ""especially this little man, who needs all the strength and character that he can get."" My father would shrug his shoulders and study the barometer, for he took an interest in meteorology, while my mother, keeping very quiet so as not to disturb him, looked at him with tender respect, but not too hard, not wishing to penetrate the mysteries of his superior mind. But my grandmother, in all weathers, even when the rain was coming down in torrents and Françoise had rushed indoors with the precious wicker armchairs, so that they should not get soaked—you would see my grandmother pacing the deserted garden, lashed by the storm, pushing back her grey hair in disorder so that her brows might be more free to imbibe the life-giving draughts of wind and rain. She would say, ""At last one can breathe!"" and would run up and down the soaking paths—too straight and symmetrical for her liking, owing to the want of any feeling for nature in the new gardener, whom my father had been asking all morning if the weather were going to improve—with her keen, jerky little step regulated by the various effects wrought upon her soul by the intoxication of the storm, the force of hygiene, the stupidity of my education and of symmetry in gardens, rather than by any anxiety (for that was quite unknown to her) to save her plum-coloured skirt from the spots of mud under which it would gradually disappear to a depth which always provided her maid with a fresh problem and filled her with fresh despair."

"Pourtant un jour que ma grand’mère était allée demander un service à une dame qu’elle avait connue au Sacré-Cœur (et avec laquelle, à cause de notre conception des castes, elle n’avait pas voulu rester en relations, malgré une sympathie réciproque), la marquise de Villeparisis, de la célèbre famille de Bouillon, celle-ci lui avait dit : « Je crois que vous connaissez beaucoup M. Swann qui est un grand ami de mes neveux des Laumes ». Ma grand’mère était revenue de sa visite enthousiasmée par la maison qui donnait sur des jardins et où Mme de Villeparisis lui conseillait de louer, et aussi par un giletier et sa fille, qui avaient leur boutique dans la cour et chez qui elle était entrée demander qu’on fît un point à sa jupe qu’elle avait déchirée dans l’escalier. Ma grand’mère avait trouvé ces gens parfaits, elle déclarait que la petite était une perle et que le giletier était l’homme le plus distingué, le mieux qu’elle eût jamais vu. Car pour elle, la distinction était quelque chose d’absolument indépendant du rang social. Elle s’extasiait sur une réponse que le giletier lui avait faite, disant à maman : « Sévigné n’aurait pas mieux dit ! » et, en revanche, d’un neveu de Mme de Villeparisis qu’elle avait rencontré chez elle : « Ah ! ma fille, comme il est commun ! »","Yet one day when my grandmother had gone to ask a favor from a lady she had known at the Sacred Heart (and with whom, because of our conception of caste, she had not wanted to remain in contact, despite a mutual sympathy), the Marquise de Villeparisis, of the famous Bouillon family, she had said to him: ""I believe that you know M. Swann very well, who is a great friend of my nephews from Laumes"". My grandmother had returned from her visit enthusiastic about the house which overlooked the gardens and where Madame de Villeparisis advised her to rent, and also about a waistcoat maker and his daughter, who had their shop in the courtyard and whose house she had entered. to ask for a stitch to be made on her skirt which she had torn on the stairs. My grandmother had found these people perfect, she declared that the little one was a pearl and that the vest-maker was the most distinguished man, the best she had ever seen. Because for her, distinction was something absolutely independent of social rank. She was in ecstasies over an answer that the waistcoat maker had given her, saying to mum: “Sévigné couldn’t have said it better! and, on the other hand, of a nephew of Madame de Villeparisis whom she had met at her home: “Ah! my daughter, how common! »","Yet one day when my grandmother had gone to ask a favor from a lady she had known at the Sacré-Coeur10 (and with whom, because of our notion of the castes, she had not wished to remain in close contact despite a reciprocal congeniality), this lady, the Marquise de Villeparisis of the famous de Bouillon11 family, had said to her: “I believe you know M.

"Dès le commencement du repas, comme M. de Forcheville, placé à la droite de MmeVerdurin qui avait fait pour le « nouveau » de grands frais de toilette, lui disait : « C’est original, cette robe blanche », le docteur qui n’avait cessé de l’observer tant il était curieux de savoir comment était fait ce qu’il appelait un « de », et qui cherchait une occasion d’attirer son attention et d’entrer plus en contact avec lui, saisit au vol le mot « blanche », et sans lever le nez de son assiette, dit : « blanche ?","From the beginning of the meal, as M. de Forcheville, seated to the right of Mme. had ceased to observe him, so curious was he to know how what he called a ""de"" was made, and who was looking for an opportunity to attract his attention and enter into more contact with him, seized the word ""blanche"", and without raising his nose from his plate, said: ""blanche?","At the very beginning of the meal, when M. de Forcheville, placed to the right of Mme.

"Souvent sur la place, quand nous rentrions, ma grand’mère me faisait arrêter pour le regarder. Des fenêtres de sa tour, placées deux par deux les unes au-dessus des autres, avec cette juste et originale proportion dans les distances qui ne donne pas de la beauté et de la dignité qu’aux visages humains, il lâchait, laissait tomber à intervalles réguliers des volées de corbeaux qui, pendant un moment, tournoyaient en criant, comme si les vieilles pierres qui les laissaient s’ébattre sans paraître les voir, devenues tout d’un coup inhabitables et dégageant un principe d’agitation infinie, les avait frappés et repoussés. Puis, après avoir rayé en tous sens le velours violet de l’air du soir, brusquement calmés ils revenaient s’absorber dans la tour, de néfaste redevenue propice, quelques-uns posés çà et là, ne semblant pas bouger, mais happant peut-être quelque insecte, sur la pointe d’un clocheton, comme une mouette arrêtée avec l’immobilité d’un pêcheur à la crête d’une vague. Sans trop savoir pourquoi, ma grand’mère trouvait au clocher de Saint-Hilaire cette absence de vulgarité, de prétention, de mesquinerie, qui lui faisait aimer et croire riches d’une influence bienfaisante la nature quand la main de l’homme ne l’avait pas, comme faisait le jardinier de ma grand’tante, rapetissée, et les œuvres de génie. Et sans doute, toute partie de l’église qu’on apercevait la distinguait de tout autre édifice par une sorte de pensée qui lui était infuse, mais c’était dans son clocher qu’elle semblait prendre conscience d’elle-même, affirmer une existence individuelle et responsable.","Often in the square, when we came home, my grandmother made me stop to look at him. From the windows of his tower, placed two by two one above the other, with that just and original proportion in the distances which does not give the beauty and dignity that to human faces, he let go, let fall to regular intervals of flocks of crows which, for a moment, whirled around, shouting, as if the old stones which let them frolic without seeming to see them, having suddenly become uninhabitable and giving off a principle of infinite agitation, had struck and repelled. Then, after streaking the violet velvet of the evening air in all directions, they suddenly calmed down and returned to absorb themselves in the tower, which had become fatally propitious again, some perched here and there, not seeming to move, -to be some insect, on the tip of a steeple, like a seagull stopped with the immobility of a fisherman at the crest of a wave. Without quite knowing why, my grandmother found in the steeple of Saint-Hilaire that absence of vulgarity, of pretension, of pettiness, which made her love and believe that nature was rich in a beneficent influence when the hand of man did not touch it. had not, as my great-aunt's gardener did, shrunk, and the works of genius. And no doubt every part of the church that you saw distinguished it from any other building by a kind of thought infused into it, but it was in its steeple that it seemed to become aware of itself, to affirm an individual and responsible existence.","Often in the square, when we were coming home, my grandmother would make me stop to look at it. From the windows of its tower, placed two by two one above the other, with the exact and original proportion in their spacing that gives beauty and dignity not just to human faces, it loosed, dropped at regular intervals, volleys of crows which, for a moment, circled about shrieking, as if the old stones that allowed them to hop and flutter about without appearing to see them had suddenly become uninhabitable and emitted some principle of infinite agitation, struck them and driven them out. Then, after striping in every direction the violet velvet of the evening air, they would return suddenly calm to be reabsorbed into the tower, which was no longer baneful but once again benign, a few of them sitting here and there, apparently motionless, but perhaps snapping up some insect, on the tip of a turret, like a seagull as still as a fisherman on the crest of a wave. Without really knowing why, my grandmother found in the steeple of Saint-Hilaire that absence of vulgarity, of pretension, of meanness, which made her love and believe rich in beneficent influence not only nature, when the hand of man had not, as had my great-aunt’s gardener, shrunk and reduced it, but also works of genius. And certainly, every part of the church that one could see distinguished it from all other buildings by a sort of thoughtfulness that was infused into it, but it was in the steeple that it seemed to become aware of itself, affirm an individual and responsible existence.","Often in the Square, as we came home, my grandmother would make me stop to look up at it. From the tower windows, placed two and two, one pair above another, with that right and original proportion in their spacing to which not only human faces owe their beauty and dignity, it released, it let fall at regular intervals flights of jackdaws which for a little while would wheel and caw, as though the ancient stones which allowed them to sport thus and never seemed to see them, becoming of a sudden uninhabitable and discharging some infinitely disturbing element, had struck them and driven them forth. Then after patterning everywhere the violet velvet of the evening air, abruptly soothed, they would return and be absorbed in the tower, deadly no longer but benignant, some perching here and there (not seeming to move, but snapping, perhaps, and swallowing some passing insect) on the points of turrets, as a seagull perches, with an angler's immobility, on the crest of a wave. Without quite knowing why, my grandmother found in the steeple of Saint-Hilaire that absence of vulgarity, pretension, and meanness which made her love—and deem rich in beneficent influences—nature itself, when the hand of man had not, as did my great-aunt's gardener, trimmed it, and the works of genius. And certainly every part one saw of the church served to distinguish the whole from any other building by a kind of general feeling which pervaded it, but it was in the steeple that the church seemed to display a consciousness of itself, to affirm its individual and responsible existence."
"– Mais, madame, il est de l’Académie, répliqua le docteur d’un ton ironique.

"Au bout d’un moment, j’entrais l’embrasser ; Françoise faisait infuser son thé ; ou, si ma tante se sentait agitée, elle demandait à la place sa tisane, et c’étais moi qui étais chargé de faire tomber du sac de pharmacie dans une assiette la quantité de tilleul qu’il fallait mettre ensuite dans l’eau bouillante. Le desséchement des tiges les avait incurvées en un capricieux treillage dans les entrelacs duquel s’ouvraient les fleurs pâles, comme si un peintre les eût arrangées, les eût fait poser de la façon la plus ornementale. Les feuilles, ayant perdu ou changé leur aspect, avaient l’air des choses les plus disparates, d’une aile transparente de mouche, de l’envers blanc d’une étiquette, d’un pétale de rose, mais qui eussent été empilées, concassées ou tressées comme dans la confection d’un nid. Mille petits détails inutiles – charmante prodigalité du pharmacien – qu’on eût supprimés dans une préparation factice, me donnaient, comme un livre où on s’émerveille de rencontrer le nom d’une personne de connaissance, le plaisir de comprendre que c’était bien des tiges de vrais tilleuls, comme ceux que je voyais avenue de la Gare, modifiées, justement parce que c’étaient non des doubles, mais elles-mêmes et qu’elles avaient vieilli. Et chaque caractère nouveau n’y étant que la métamorphose d’un caractère ancien, dans de petites boules grises je reconnaissais les boutons verts qui ne sont pas venus à terme ; mais surtout l’éclat rose, lunaire et doux qui faisait se détacher les fleurs dans la forêt fragile des tiges où elles étaient suspendues comme de petites roses d’or – signe, comme la lueur qui révèle encore sur une muraille la place d’une fresque effacée, de la différence entre les parties de l’arbre qui avaient été « en couleur » et celles qui ne l’avaient pas été – me montrait que ces pétales étaient bien ceux qui avant de fleurir le sac de pharmacie avaient embaumé les soirs de printemps. Cette flamme rose de cierge, c’était leur couleur encore, mais à demi éteinte et assoupie dans cette vie diminuée qu’était la leur maintenant et qui est comme le crépuscule des fleurs. Bientôt ma tante pouvait tremper dans l’infusion bouillante dont elle savourait le goût de feuille morte ou de fleur fanée une petite madeleine dont elle me tendait un morceau quand il était suffisamment amolli.","After a while I went in to kiss her; Françoise was infusing her tea; or, if my aunt felt agitated, she would instead ask for her herbal tea, and it was I who was responsible for dropping from the pharmacy bag onto a plate the quantity of linden that was then to be put in boiling water . The drying of the stems had curved them into a capricious trellis in whose interlacing the pale flowers opened, as if a painter had arranged them, had made them pose in the most ornamental fashion. The leaves, having lost or changed their aspect, looked like the most disparate things, like the transparent wing of a fly, the white back of a label, a rose petal, but which had been piled up , crushed or braided as in the making of a nest. A thousand little useless details – charming prodigality of the pharmacist – which had been suppressed in a factitious preparation, gave me, like a book in which one marvels at encountering the name of a person of acquaintance, the pleasure of understanding that it was many stems of real lime trees, like those I saw on the avenue de la Gare, modified, precisely because they were not doubles, but themselves and because they had aged. And each new character being there only the metamorphosis of an old character, in small gray balls I recognized the green buttons which did not come to term; but above all the pink, lunar and soft radiance that made the flowers stand out in the fragile forest of the stems where they hung like little golden roses – a sign, like the glow that still reveals on a wall the place of a erased fresco, of the difference between the parts of the tree which had been ""in color"" and those which had not been - showed me that these petals were indeed those which before flowering the pharmacy bag had perfumed the evenings of spring. This pink candle flame was still their color, but half extinguished and drowsy in this diminished life which was theirs now and which is like the twilight of flowers. Soon my aunt was able to dip into the boiling infusion, whose taste of dead leaves or wilted flowers she savored, a little madeleine, of which she would hand me a piece when it was sufficiently softened.","After a moment I would go in and kiss her; Françoise would be steeping her tea; or, if my aunt was feeling agitated, she would ask instead for her infusion and I would be the one entrusted with pouring from the pharmacy bag onto a plate the quantity of lime blossom which then had to be put into the boiling water. The drying of the stems had curved them into a whimsical trelliswork in whose interlacings the pale flowers opened, as if a painter had arranged them, posing them in the most ornamental way. The leaves, having lost or changed their aspect, looked like the most disparate things, a fly’s transparent wing, the white back of a label, a rose petal, but these things had been heaped up, crushed, or woven as in the construction of a nest. A thousand small useless details—the charming prodigality of the pharmacist—that would have been eliminated in an artificial preparation gave me, like a book in which one is amazed to encounter the name of a person one knows, the pleasure of realizing that these were actually stems of real lime blossoms, like those I saw in the avenue de la Gare, altered precisely because they were not duplicates but themselves, and because they had aged. And since here, each new characteristic was only the metamorphosis of an old characteristic, in some little gray balls I recognized the green buds that had not come to their term; but especially the pink luster, lunar and soft, that made the flowers stand out amid the fragile forest of stems where they were suspended like little gold roses—a sign, like the glow on a wall that still reveals the location of a fresco that has worn away, of the difference between the parts of the tree that had been “in color” and those that had not—showed me that these petals were in fact the same ones that, before filling the pharmacy bag with flowers, had embalmed the spring evenings. That candle-pink flame was their color still, but half doused and drowsing in the diminished life that was theirs now, and that is a sort of twilight of flowers. Soon my aunt would be able to dip into the boiling infusion, of which she savored the taste of dead leaf or faded flower, a small madeleine, a piece of which she would hold out to me when it had sufficiently softened.","After waiting a minute, I would go in and kiss her; Françoise would be making her tea; or, if my aunt were feeling 'upset,' she would ask instead for her 'tisane,' and it would be my duty to shake out of the chemist's little package on to a plate the amount of lime-blossom required for infusion in boiling water. The drying of the stems had twisted them into a fantastic trellis, in whose intervals the pale flowers opened, as though a painter had arranged them there, grouping them in the most decorative poses. The leaves, which had lost or altered their own appearance, assumed those instead of the most incongruous things imaginable, as though the transparent wings of flies or the blank sides of labels or the petals of roses had been collected and pounded, or interwoven as birds weave the material for their nests. A thousand trifling little details—the charming prodigality of the chemist—details which would have been eliminated from an artificial preparation, gave me, like a book in which one is astonished to read the name of a person whom one knows, the pleasure of finding that these were indeed real lime-blossoms, like those I had seen, when coming from the train, in the Avenue de la Gare, altered, but only because they were not imitations but the very same blossoms, which had grown old. And as each new character is merely a metamorphosis from something older, in these little grey balls I recognised green buds plucked before their time; but beyond all else the rosy, moony, tender glow which lit up the blossoms among the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden roses—marking, as the radiance upon an old wall still marks the place of a vanished fresco, the difference between those parts of the tree which had and those which had not been 'in bloom'—shewed me that these were petals which, before their flowering-time, the chemist's package had embalmed on warm evenings of spring. That rosy candlelight was still their colour, but half-extinguished and deadened in the diminished life which was now theirs, and which may be called the twilight of a flower. Presently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion, in which she would relish the savour of dead or faded blossom, a little madeleine, of which she would hold out a piece to me when it was sufficiently soft."
"C’est ainsi que, sur les conseils qu’une mère prévoyante lui avait donnés quand il avait quitté sa province, il ne laissait jamais passer soit une locution ou un nom propre qui lui étaient inconnus sans tâcher de se faire documenter sur eux.","Thus, on the advice that a provident mother had given him when he had left his province, he never let either a phrase or a proper name that were unknown to him pass without trying to get documentation on them.","And so, acting on the advice given him by a foresightful mother when he left her province, he never let pass either an expression or a proper name that was unknown to him, without trying to acquire documentation about it.","So it was that, following the advice given him by a wise mother on his first coming up to the capital from his provincial home, he would never let pass either a figure of speech or a proper name that was new to him without an effort to secure the fullest information upon it."
"Swann aimait beaucoup la princesse des Laumes, puis sa vue lui rappelait Guermantes, terre voisine de Combray, tout ce pays qu’il aimait tant et où il ne retournait plus pour ne pas s’éloigner d’Odette. Usant des formes mi-artistes, mi-galantes, par lesquelles il savait plaire à la princesse et qu’il retrouvait tout naturellement quand il se retrempait un instant dans son ancien milieu – et voulant d’autre part pour lui-même exprimer la nostalgie qu’il avait de la campagne : – Ah ! dit-il à la cantonade, pour être entendu à la fois de Mme de Saint-Euverte à qui il parlait et de Mme des Laumes pour qui il parlait, voici la charmante princesse ! Voyez, elle est venue tout exprès de Guermantes pour entendre le Saint François d’Assise de Liszt et elle n’a eu le temps, comme une jolie mésange, que d’aller piquer pour les mettre sur sa tête quelques petits fruits de prunier des oiseaux et d’aubépine ; il y a même encore de petites gouttes de rosée, un peu de la gelée blanche qui doit faire gémir la duchesse. C’est très joli, ma chère princesse.","Swann was very fond of the Princess of Laumes, then the sight of her reminded him of Guermantes, land near Combray, all that country he loved so much and where he never returned so as not to get away from Odette. Using forms half-artist, half-gallant, by which he knew how to please the princess and which he found quite naturally when he immersed himself for a moment in his old environment - and on the other hand wanting for himself to express the nostalgia he had from the country: “Ah! he said out loud, to be heard both by Madame de Saint-Euverte to whom he was speaking and by Madame des Laumes for whom he was speaking, here is the charming princess! You see, she came from Guermantes expressly to hear Liszt's Saint Francis of Assisi and she only had time, like a pretty chickadee, to go and prick some small plum-tree fruits from the birds and hawthorn; there are even still small drops of dew, a little of the hoarfrost which must make the Duchess groan. It's very pretty, my dear princess.","Swann liked the Princesse des Laumes very much, and the sight of her also reminded him of Guermantes, the estate next to Combray, the whole countryside which he loved so much and had ceased to visit so as not to be away from Odette. Using the half-artistic, half-courtly formulae which he knew were pleasing to the Princesse and which he resumed quite naturally whenever he reimmersed himself for a moment in his old social milieu—and wanting anyway for his own sake to express the yearning he felt for the country: “Ah,” he said to some vague general audience, in order to be heard both by Mme. de Saint-Euverte, to whom he was speaking, and by Mme. des Laumes, for whom he was speaking, “here’s the charming Princesse! See, she has come up from Guermantes expressly to hear Liszt’s Saint Francis of Assisi and has only just had time, like a pretty titmouse, to go and pluck a little fruit from the wild plums and hawthorns and put them on her head; there is even a bit of dew on them still, a bit of the hoarfrost that must be making the duchess groan so. It’s very pretty indeed, my dear Princesse.”","Swann was extremely fond of the Princesse des Laumes, and the sight of her recalled to him Guermantes, a property close to Combray, and all that country which he so dearly loved and had ceased to visit, so as not to be separated from Odette. Slipping into the manner, half-artistic, half-amorous—with which he could always manage to amuse the Princess—a manner which came to him quite naturally whenever he dipped for a moment into the old social atmosphere, and wishing also to express in words, for his own satisfaction, the longing that he felt for the country: ""Ah!"" he exclaimed, or rather intoned, in such a way as to be audible at once to Mme. de Saint-Euverte, to whom he spoke, and to Mme. des Laumes, for whom he was speaking, ""Behold our charming Princess! See, she has come up on purpose from Guermantes to hear Saint Francis preach to the birds, and has only just had time, like a dear little tit-mouse, to go and pick a few little hips and haws and put them in her hair; there are even some drops of dew upon them still, a little of the hoar-frost which must be making the Duchess, down there, shiver. It is very pretty indeed, my dear Princess."""
"– Ah ! si madame Verdurin commence à peloter les bronzes, nous n’entendrons pas de musique ce soir, dit le peintre.","– Ah! if Madame Verdurin begins to grope the bronzes, we won't hear any music this evening, said the painter.","“Ah, if Madame Verdurin begins fondling the bronzes, we won’t hear any music tonight,” said the painter.","""If Mme. Verdurin is going to start playing about with her bronzes,"" said the painter, ""we shan't get any music to-night."""
"S’il était obligé de donner des excuses aux gens du monde pour ne pas leur faire de visites, c’était de lui en faire qu’il cherchait à s’excuser auprès d’Odette. Encore les payait-il (se demandant à la fin du mois, pour peu qu’il eût un peu abusé de sa patience et fût allé souvent la voir, si c’était assez de lui envoyer quatre mille francs), et pour chacune trouvait un prétexte, un présent à lui apporter, un renseignement dont elle avait besoin, M. de Charlus qu’elle avait rencontré allant chez elle et qui avait exigé qu’il l’accompagnât. Et à défaut d’aucun, il priait M. de Charlus de courir chez elle, de lui dire comme spontanément, au cours de la conversation, qu’il se rappelait avoir à parler à Swann, qu’elle voulût bien lui faire demander de passer tout de suite chez elle ; mais le plus souvent Swann attendait en vain et M. de Charlus lui disait le soir que son moyen n’avait pas réussi. De sorte que si elle faisait maintenant de fréquentes absences, même à Paris, quand elle y restait, elle le voyait peu, et elle qui, quand elle l’aimait, lui disait : « Je suis toujours libre » et « Qu’est-ce que l’opinion des autres peut me faire ? », maintenant, chaque fois qu’il voulait la voir, elle invoquait les convenances ou prétextait des occupations. Quand il parlait d’aller à une fête de charité, à un vernissage, à une première, où elle serait, elle lui disait qu’il voulait afficher leur liaison, qu’il la traitait comme une fille.","If he was obliged to give excuses to society people for not paying them visits, it was to pay them visits that he sought to apologize to Odette. Still he paid them (wondering at the end of the month, if he had a little abused his patience and had often gone to see her, if it was enough to send her four thousand francs), and for each one found a pretext, a present to bring her, some information she needed, M. de Charlus whom she had met going to her house and who had demanded that he accompany her. And in the absence of anyone, he asked M. de Charlus to run to her, to tell her, as if spontaneously, during the conversation, that he remembered having to speak to Swann, that she was good enough to ask him to go straight to her place; but most often Swann waited in vain, and M. de Charlus told him in the evening that his method had not succeeded. So that if she now made frequent absences, even in Paris, when she stayed there, she saw him little, and she who, when she loved him, said to him: ""I am always free"" and ""What is What can other people's opinions do to me? now, whenever he wanted to see her, she invoked propriety or pretexted occupations. When he talked about going to a charity party, a vernissage, a premiere, where she would be, she told him that he wanted to display their affair, that he treated her like a girl.","If he was obliged to give his excuses to the society people for not visiting them, it was precisely for his visits to her that he sought to excuse himself to Odette. He even paid for them (asking himself at the end of the month, supposing he had abused her patience somewhat and gone to see her many times, if it was enough to send her four thousand francs), and for each one found a pretext, a present to bring her, a piece of information she needed, M. de Charlus whom he had met going to her house and who had demanded that he accompany him. And, lacking one, he would ask M. de Charlus if he would please run over to her house, remark to her as though spontaneously, in the course of the conversation, that he remembered he had something to say to Swann, would she kindly send for him to come to her house right away; but most often Swann would wait in vain and M. de Charlus would tell him in the evening that his plan had not succeeded. So that if she was often away from Paris now, even when she stayed there she saw very little of him, and she who, when she was in love with him, used to say: “I’m always free” and “What do I care what others think?” would now, each time he wanted to see her, invoke social conventions or plead other engagements. When he mentioned that he might be going to some charity ball, opening, premiere where she would be, she would tell him that he was trying to flaunt their affair, that he was treating her like a prostitute.","If he was obliged to make excuses to his fashionable friends for not paying them visits, it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her that he sought to excuse himself to Odette. He still paid them (asking himself at the end of each month whether, seeing that he had perhaps exhausted her patience, and had certainly gone rather often to see her, it would be enough if he sent her four thousand francs), and for each visit he found a pretext, a present that he had to bring her, some information which she required, M. de Charlus, whom he had met actually going to her house, and who had insisted upon Swann's accompanying him. And, failing any excuse, he would beg M. de Charlus to go to her at once, and to tell her, as though spontaneously, in the course of conversation, that he had just remembered something that he had to say to Swann, and would she please send a message to Swann's house asking him to come to her then and there; but as a rule Swann waited at home in vain, and M. de Charlus informed him, later in the evening, that his device had not proved successful. With the result that, if she was now frequently away from Paris, even when she was there he scarcely saw her; that she who, when she was in love with him, used to say, ""I am always free"" and ""What can it matter to me, what other people think?"" now, whenever he wanted to see her, appealed to the proprieties or pleaded some engagement. When he spoke of going to a charity entertainment, or a private view, or a first-night at which she was to be present, she would expostulate that he wished to advertise their relations in public, that he was treating her like a woman off the streets."
"Aussi bien que ce moment (le premier soir qu’ils avaient « fait catleya ») où elle lui avait dit sortir de la Maison Dorée, combien devait-il y en avoir eu d’autres, receleurs eux aussi d’un mensonge que Swann n’avait pas soupçonné. Il se rappela qu’elle lui avait dit un jour : « Je n’aurais qu’à dire à MmeVerdurin que ma robe n’a pas été prête, que mon cab est venu en retard. Il y a toujours moyen de s’arranger. » À lui aussi probablement bien des fois où elle lui avait glissé de ces mots qui expliquent un retard, justifient un changement d’heure dans un rendez-vous, ils avaient dû cacher, sans qu’il s’en fût douté alors, quelque chose qu’elle avait à faire avec un autre à qui elle avait dit : « Je n’aurai qu’à dire à Swann que ma robe n’a pas été prête, que mon cab est arrivé en retard, il y a toujours moyen de s’arranger. » Et sous tous les souvenirs les plus doux de Swann, sous les paroles les plus simples que lui avait dites autrefois Odette, qu’il avait crues comme paroles d’évangile, sous les actions quotidiennes qu’elle lui avait racontées, sous les lieux les plus accoutumés, la maison de sa couturière, l’avenue du Bois, l’Hippodrome, il sentait (dissimulée à la faveur de cet excédent de temps qui dans les journées les plus détaillées laisse encore du jeu, de la place, et peut servir de cachette à certaines actions), il sentait s’insinuer la présence possible et souterraine de mensonges qui lui rendaient ignoble tout ce qui lui était resté le plus cher, ses meilleurs soirs, la rue La Pérouse elle-même, qu’Odette avait toujours dû quitter à d’autres heures que celles qu’elle lui avait dites, faisant circuler partout un peu de la ténébreuse horreur qu’il avait ressentie en entendant l’aveu relatif à la Maison Dorée, et, comme les bêtes immondes dans la Désolation de Ninive, ébranlant pierre à pierre tout son passé. Si maintenant il se détournait chaque fois que sa mémoire lui disait le nom cruel de la Maison Dorée, ce n’était plus, comme tout récemment encore à la soirée de Mme de Saint-Euverte, parce qu’il lui rappelait un bonheur qu’il avait perdu depuis longtemps, mais un malheur qu’il venait seulement d’apprendre. Puis il en fut du nom de la Maison Dorée comme de celui de l’île du Bois, il cessa peu à peu de faire souffrir Swann. Car ce que nous croyons notre amour, notre jalousie, n’est pas une même passion continue, indivisible. Ils se composent d’une infinité d’amours successifs, de jalousies différentes et qui sont éphémères, mais par leur multitude ininterrompue donnent l’impression de la continuité, l’illusion de l’unité. La vie de l’amour de Swann, la fidélité de sa jalousie, étaient faites de la mort, de l’infidélité, d’innombrables désirs, d’innombrables doutes, qui avaient tous Odette pour objet. S’il était resté longtemps sans la voir, ceux qui mouraient n’auraient pas été remplacés par d’autres. Mais la présence d’Odette continuait d’ensemencer le cœur de Swann de tendresse et de soupçons alternés.","As well as that moment (the first evening that they had ""made cattleya"") when she had told him to get out of the Golden House, how many others must there have been, also concealers of a lie that Swann hadn't suspected. He remembered that she had said to him one day: ""I would only have to tell Madame Verdurin that my dress was not ready, that my cab came late."" There is always a way to work it out. Probably to him too many times when she had slipped him these words which explain a delay, justify a change of time in an appointment, they must have hidden, without his suspecting it at the time, some something she had to do with another to whom she had said: ""I'll just have to tell Swann that my dress wasn't ready, that my cab arrived late, there's always a way to arrange. And under all the sweetest memories of Swann, under the simplest words that Odette had once said to him, which he had believed to be words of the gospel, under the daily actions that she had told him about, under the places the most accustomed, the house of his seamstress, the avenue du Bois, the Hippodrome, he felt (concealed in favor of this excess of time which in the most detailed days still leaves room, space, and can serve as a hiding place for certain actions), he felt the possible and subterranean presence of lies creeping in which made him ignoble all that had remained most dear to him, his best evenings, the rue La Pérouse itself, which Odette had always had to leave at other times than those she had told him, circulating everywhere a little of the dark horror he had felt on hearing the confession relating to the Golden House, and, like the filthy beasts in the Desolation of Nineveh, shaking stone by stone his whole past. If now he turned away each time his memory told him the cruel name of the Maison Dorée, it was no longer, as quite recently at Mme de Saint-Euverte's evening, because he reminded him of a happiness that he had lost a long time ago, but a misfortune he had only just learned of. Then it was with the name of the Maison Dorée as with that of the Île du Bois, it gradually ceased to make Swann suffer. Because what we believe our love, our jealousy, is not the same continuous, indivisible passion. They are made up of an infinity of successive loves, of different jealousies and which are ephemeral, but by their uninterrupted multitude give the impression of continuity, the illusion of unity. The life of Swann's love, the fidelity of his jealousy, were made up of death, of infidelity, of innumerable desires, of innumerable doubts, all of which had Odette as their object. If he had gone a long time without seeing her, those who died would not have been replaced by others. But Odette's presence continued to sow Swann's heart with alternating tenderness and suspicion.","Besides that time (the first evening they had “made cattleya”) when she had told him she was coming from the Maison Dorée, how many others there must have been, each of them also harboring a lie which Swann had not suspected. He remembered that one day she had said to him: “I would simply tell Mme. Verdurin my dress wasn’t ready, or my cab came late. There’s always a way to manage it.” From him too, probably, many times when she had murmured the sorts of words which explain a delay, justify a change in the hour of a meeting, they must have concealed, without his suspecting it then, something she was going to do with some other man, with some other man to whom she had said: “I’ll simply tell Swann my dress wasn’t ready, or my cab came late. There’s always a way to manage it.” And under all of Swann’s sweetest memories, under the simplest words Odette had said to him in the old days, which he had believed like the words of the gospel, under the daily actions she had recounted to him, under the most ordinary places, her dressmaker’s house, the avenue du Bois, the Hippodrome, he sensed, concealed within the surplus time which even in the most thoroughly itemized days still leaves some play, some room, and can serve as hiding places for certain actions, he sensed insinuating itself the possible subterranean presence of lies which made something ignoble out of all that had remained most dear to him (his best evenings, the rue La Pérouse itself, which Odette must always have left at other hours than those she had reported to him), propagating everywhere a little of the dark horror he had felt when he heard her admission about the Maison Dorée, and, like the loathsome beasts in the Desolation of Nineveh,113 toppling stone by stone his entire past. If he now turned away each time his memory spoke the bitter name of the Maison Dorée, it was no longer, as still quite recently at Mme. de Saint-Euverte’s party, because it recalled to him a happiness he had long since lost, but because it recalled to him an unhappiness he had only just discovered. Then the same thing happened to the name of the Maison Dorée as to that of the island in the Bois, it gradually ceased to hurt Swann. For what we believe to be our love, or our jealousy, is not one single passion, continuous and indivisible. They are composed of an infinity of successive loves, of different jealousies, which are ephemeral but by their uninterrupted multitude give the impression of continuity, the illusion of unity. The life of Swann’s love, the faithfulness of his jealousy, were formed of the death, the faithlessness, of numberless desires, numberless doubts, all of which had Odette as their object. If he had remained for a long time without seeing her, those that died would not have been replaced by others. But the presence of Odette continued to sow Swann’s heart with affection and suspicion by turns.","Besides that moment (that first evening on which they had ""done a cattleya"") when she had told him that she was coming from the Maison Dorée, how many others must there have been, each of them covering a falsehood of which Swann had had no suspicion. He recalled how she had said to him once: ""I need only tell Mme. Verdurin that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse."" From himself too, probably, many times when she had glibly uttered such words as explain a delay or justify an alteration of the hour fixed for a meeting, those moments must have hidden, without his having the least inkling of it at the time, an engagement that she had had with some other man, some man to whom she had said: ""I need only tell Swann that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse."" And beneath all his most pleasant memories, beneath the simplest words that Odette had ever spoken to him in those old days, words which he had believed as though they were the words of a Gospel, beneath her daily actions which she had recounted to him, beneath the most ordinary places, her dressmaker's flat, the Avenue du Bois, the Hippodrome, he could feel (dissembled there, by virtue of that temporal superfluity which, after the most detailed account of how a day has been spent, always leaves something over, that may serve as a hiding place for certain unconfessed actions), he could feel the insinuation of a possible undercurrent of falsehood which debased for him all that had remained most precious, his happiest evenings, the Rue La Pérouse itself, which Odette must constantly have been leaving at other hours than those of which she told him; extending the power of the dark horror that had gripped him when he had heard her admission with regard to the Maison Dorée, and, like the obscene creatures in the 'Desolation of Nineveh,' shattering, stone by stone, the whole edifice of his past.... If, now, he turned aside whenever his memory repeated the cruel name of the Maison Dorée it was because that name recalled to him, no longer, as, such a little time since, at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's party, the good fortune which he long had lost, but a misfortune of which he was now first aware. Then it befell the Maison Dorée, as it had befallen the Island in the Bois, that gradually its name ceased to trouble him. For what we suppose to be our love, our jealousy are, neither of them, single, continuous and individual passions. They are composed of an infinity of successive loves, of different jealousies, each of which is ephemeral, although by their uninterrupted multitude they give us the impression of continuity, the illusion of unity. The life of Swann's love, the fidelity of his jealousy, were formed out of death, of infidelity, of innumerable desires, innumerable doubts, all of which had Odette for their object. If he had remained for any length of time without seeing her, those that died would not have been replaced by others. But the presence of Odette continued to sow in Swann's heart alternate seeds of love and suspicion."
"Maintenant, à toutes les paroles de Swann elle répondait d’un ton parfois irrité, parfois indulgent : – Ah ! tu ne seras donc jamais comme tout le monde !","Now, to all of Swann's words she replied in a tone sometimes irritated, sometimes indulgent: “Ah! you will never be like everyone else!","Now, to all of Swann’s remarks she would reply in a tone that was at times irritated, at times indulgent: “Oh, you really never will be like anyone else!”","But, now, whatever he might say, she would answer, in a tone sometimes of irritation, sometimes indulgent: ""Ah! so you never will be like other people!"""

"Comme je n’avais aucune notion sur la hiérarchie sociale, depuis longtemps l’impossibilité que mon père trouvait à ce que nous fréquentions Mme et Mlle Swann avait eu plutôt pour effet, en me faisant imaginer entre elles et nous de grandes distances, de leur donner à mes yeux du prestige. Je regrettais que ma mère ne se teignît pas les cheveux et ne se mît pas de rouge aux lèvres comme j’avais entendu dire par notre voisine MmeSazerat que Mme Swann le faisait pour plaire, non à son mari, mais à M. de Charlus, et je pensais que nous devions être pour elle un objet de mépris, ce qui me peinait surtout à cause de Mlle Swann qu’on m’avait dit être une si jolie petite fille et à laquelle je rêvais souvent en lui prêtant chaque fois un même visage arbitraire et charmant. Mais quand j’eus appris ce jour-là que Mlle Swann était un être d’une condition si rare, baignant comme dans son élément naturel au milieu de tant de privilèges, que quand elle demandait à ses parents s’il y avait quelqu’un à dîner, on lui répondait par ces syllabes remplies de lumière, par le nom de ce convive d’or qui n’était pour elle qu’un vieil ami de sa famille : Bergotte ; que, pour elle, la causerie intime à table, ce qui correspondait à ce qu’était pour moi la conversation de ma grand’tante, c’étaient des paroles de Bergotte, sur tous ces sujets qu’il n’avait pu aborder dans ses livres, et sur lesquels j’aurais voulu l’écouter rendre ses oracles ; et qu’enfin, quand elle allait visiter des villes, il cheminait à côté d’elle, inconnu et glorieux, comme les Dieux qui descendaient au milieu des mortels ; alors je sentis en même temps que le prix d’un être comme Mlle Swann, combien je lui paraîtrais grossier et ignorant, et j’éprouvai si vivement la douceur et l’impossibilité qu’il y aurait pour moi à être son ami, que je fus rempli à la fois de désir et de désespoir. Le plus souvent maintenant quand je pensais à elle, je la voyais devant le porche d’une cathédrale, m’expliquant la signification des statues, et, avec un sourire qui disait du bien de moi, me présentant comme son ami, à Bergotte. Et toujours le charme de toutes les idées que faisaient naître en moi les cathédrales, le charme des coteaux de l’Ile-de-France et des plaines de la Normandie faisait refluer ses reflets sur l’image que je me formais de Mlle Swann : c’était être tout prêt à l’aimer. Que nous croyions qu’un être participe à une vie inconnue où son amour nous ferait pénétrer, c’est, de tout ce qu’exige l’amour pour naître, ce à quoi il tient le plus, et qui lui fait faire bon marché du reste. Même les femmes qui prétendent ne juger un homme que sur son physique, voient en ce physique l’émanation d’une vie spéciale. C’est pourquoi elles aiment les militaires, les pompiers ; l’uniforme les rend moins difficiles pour le visage ; elles croient baiser sous la cuirasse un cœur différent, aventureux et doux ; et un jeune souverain, un prince héritier, pour faire les plus flatteuses conquêtes, dans les pays étrangers qu’il visite, n’a pas besoin du profil régulier qui serait peut-être indispensable à un coulissier.","As I had no idea of the social hierarchy, for a long time the impossibility that my father found of our seeing Mrs. and Miss Swann had rather had the effect, by making me imagine great distances between them and us, of their to give prestige to my eyes. I regretted that my mother did not dye her hair and put lipstick on, as I had heard from our neighbor Mme Sazerat that Mme Swann did it to please, not her husband, but M. de Charlus. and I thought that we must be an object of contempt for her, which pained me above all because of Mlle Swann, whom I had been told was such a pretty little girl and of whom I often dreamed, each time lending her the same arbitrary and charming face. But when I learned that day that Mlle. one at dinner, she was answered by these syllables filled with light, by the name of this golden guest who was for her only an old friend of her family: Bergotte; that, for her, the intimate conversation at the table, what corresponded to what my great-aunt's conversation meant to me, were Bergotte's words, on all those subjects he had been unable to broach in his books, and on which I would have liked to hear him deliver his oracles; and that finally, when she went to visit cities, he walked by her side, unknown and glorious, like the gods who descended among mortals; then I felt at the same time as the value of a being like Mlle. I was filled with both desire and despair. Most often now when I thought of her, I saw her in front of the porch of a cathedral, explaining to me the significance of the statues, and, with a smile which spoke well of me, introducing me as her friend, to Bergotte. And always the charm of all the ideas that the cathedrals gave birth to in me, the charm of the hills of Ile-de-France and the plains of Normandy made its reflections flow back on the image that I formed of Mlle Swann: it was to be completely ready to love him. That we believe that a being participates in an unknown life into which his love would lead us is, of all that love requires in order to be born, what he values most, and which makes him cheap. rest. Even women who claim to judge a man only on his physique, see in this physique the emanation of a special life. This is why they like the military, the firefighters; the uniform makes them less difficult on the face; they believe they are kissing a different, adventurous and gentle heart under the cuirass; and a young sovereign, a crown prince, in order to make the most flattering conquests in the foreign countries he visits, does not need the regular profile which would perhaps be indispensable to a coulisher.","Since I had no notion of social hierarchy, for a long time the fact that my father found it impossible for us to associate with Mme. and Mlle. Swann had had the effect above all, by making me imagine a great distance between them and us, of giving them prestige in my eyes. I was sorry my mother did not dye her hair and redden her lips as I had heard our neighbor Mme. Sazerat say that Mme. Swann did in order to please, not her husband, but M. de Charlus, and I thought we must be an object of scorn to her, which distressed me most of all because of Mlle. Swann, who, from what I had been told, was such a pretty little girl and about whom I often dreamed, giving her each time the same arbitrary and charming face. But when I learned that day that Mlle. Swann was a creature of so rare a condition, bathing as though in her natural element in the midst of such privileges, that when she asked her parents if anyone was coming to dinner, she would be answered by those syllables filled with light, by the name of that golden dinner guest who was for her only an old friend of the family: Bergotte; that for her the intimate talk at the table, the equivalent for me of my great-aunt’s conversation, would be Bergotte’s words on all the subjects he had not been able to broach in his books, and on which I would have liked to hear him pronounce his oracles; and that, lastly, when she went to visit other towns, he would walk along next to her, unknown and glorious, like the Gods who descended among mortals; then I was conscious both of the worth of a creature like Mlle. Swann and also of how crude and ignorant I would appear to her, and I felt so keenly the sweetness and the impossibility of my being her friend that I was filled with both desire and despair. Most often, now, when I thought of her, I would see her in front of a cathedral porch, explaining to me what the statues signified and, with a smile that said good things about me, introducing me as her friend to Bergotte. And always the charm of all those ideas awakened in me by the cathedrals, the charm of the hills of Île-de-France and the plains of Normandy, cast its glimmers over the picture I was forming of Mlle. Swann: this was what it meant to be on the point of falling in love with her. Our belief that a person takes part in an unknown life which his or her love would allow us to enter is, of all that love demands in order to come into being, what it prizes the most, and what makes it care little for the rest. Even women who claim to judge a man by his appearance alone see that appearance as the emanation of a special life. This is why they love soldiers, firemen; the uniform makes them less particular about the face; they think that under the breastplate they are kissing a different heart, adventurous and sweet; and a young sovereign, a crown prince, may make the most flattering conquests in the foreign countries he visits without needing the regular profile that would perhaps be indispensable to a stockbroker.","As I was still completely ignorant of the different grades in the social hierarchy, the fact that my father found it impossible for us to see anything of Swann's wife and daughter had, for a long time, had the contrary effect of making me imagine them as separated from us by an enormous gulf, which greatly enhanced their dignity and importance in my eyes. I was sorry that my mother did not dye her hair and redden her lips, as I had heard our neighbour, Mme. Sazerat, say that Mme. Swann did, to gratify not her husband but M. de Charlus; and I felt that, to her, we must be an object of scorn, which distressed me particularly on account of the daughter, such a pretty little girl, as I had heard, and one of whom I used often to dream, always imagining her with the same features and appearance, which I bestowed upon her quite arbitrarily, but with a charming effect. But from this afternoon, when I had learned that Mile. Swann was a creature living in such rare and fortunate circumstances, bathed, as in her natural element, in such a sea of privilege that, if she should ask her parents whether anyone were coming to dinner, she would be answered in those two syllables, radiant with celestial light, would hear the name of that golden guest who was to her no more than an old friend of her family, Bergotte; that for her the intimate conversation at table, corresponding to what my great-aunt's conversation was for me, would be the words of Bergotte upon all those subjects which he had not been able to take up in his writings, and on which I would fain have heard him utter oracles; and that, above all, when she went to visit other towns, he would be walking by her side, unrecognised and glorious, like the gods who came down, of old, from heaven to dwell among mortal men: then I realised both the rare worth of a creature such as Mile. Swann, and, at the same time, how coarse and ignorant I should appear to her; and I felt so keenly how pleasant and yet how impossible it would be for me to become her friend that I was filled at once with longing and with despair. And usually, from this time forth, when I thought of her, I would see her standing before the porch of a cathedral, explaining to me what each of the statues meant, and, with a smile which was my highest commendation, presenting me, as her friend, to Bergotte. And invariably the charm of all the fancies which the thought of cathedrals used to inspire in me, the charm of the hills and valleys of the He de France and of the plains of Normandy, would radiate brightness and beauty over the picture I had formed in my mind of Mile. Swann; nothing more remained but to know and to love her. Once we believe that a fellow-creature has a share in some unknown existence to which that creature's love for ourselves can win us admission, that is, of all the preliminary conditions which Love exacts, the one to which he attaches most importance, the one which makes him generous or indifferent as to the rest. Even those women who pretend that they judge a man by his exterior only, see in that exterior an emanation from some special way of life. And that is why they fall in love with a soldier or a fireman, whose uniform makes them less particular about his face; they kiss and believe that beneath the crushing breastplate there beats a heart different from the rest, more gallant, more adventurous, more tender; and so it is that a young king or a crown prince may travel in foreign countries and make the most gratifying conquests, and yet lack entirely that regular and classic profile which would be indispensable, I dare say, in an outside-broker."
"Et MmeCottard sortit de son manchon pour la tendre à Swann sa main gantée de blanc d’où s’échappa, avec une correspondance, une vision de haute vie qui remplit l’omnibus, mêlée à l’odeur du teinturier. Et Swann se sentit déborder de tendresse pour elle, autant que pour MmeVerdurin (et presque autant que pour Odette, car le sentiment qu’il éprouvait pour cette dernière n’étant plus mêlé de douleur, n’était plus guère de l’amour), tandis que de la plate-forme il la suivait de ses yeux attendris, qui enfilait courageusement la rue Bonaparte, l’aigrette haute, d’une main relevant sa jupe, de l’autre tenant son en-tout-cas et son porte-cartes dont elle laissait voir le chiffre, laissant baller devant elle son manchon.","And Madame Cottard slipped out of her muff to hold out her white-gloved hand to Swann, from which escaped, with a correspondence, a vision of high life which filled the omnibus, mingled with the odor of the dyer. And Swann felt overwhelmed with tenderness for her, as much as for Madame Verdurin (and almost as much as for Odette, because the feeling he felt for the latter was no longer mingled with pain, was hardly love anymore) , while from the platform he followed her with tender eyes, who courageously threaded the rue Bonaparte, her plume high, with one hand lifting her skirt, with the other holding her snack and her door. -cards whose number she let see, letting her muff dangle in front of her.","Cottard withdrew from her muff and held out to Swann a hand gloved in white from which escaped, along with a transfer ticket, a vision of upper-class life that filled the omnibus, mingling with the smell of the dry cleaner. And Swann felt himself overflowing with affection for her, as much as for Mme. Verdurin (and almost as much as for Odette, since the feeling he now had for the latter, being no longer mingled with pain, was hardly love anymore), while from the platform of the omnibus he followed her with his newly affectionate eyes as she courageously made her way up the rue Bonaparte, her plume high, lifting her skirt with one hand, holding in the other her sunshade and her card case with its monogram displayed, while her muff danced in front of her.","Cottard withdrew from her muff, to offer it to Swann, a white-gloved hand from which there floated, with a transier-ticket, an atmosphere of fashionable life that pervaded the omnibus, blended with the harsher fragrance of newly cleaned kid. And Swann felt himself overflowing with gratitude to her, as well as to Mme. Verdurin (and almost to Odette, for the feeling that he now entertained for her was no longer tinged with pain, was scarcely even to be described, now, as love), while from the platform of the omnibus he followed her with loving eyes, as she gallantly threaded her way along the Rue Bonaparte, her plume erect, her skirt held up in one hand, while in the other she clasped her umbrella and her card-case, so that its monogram could be seen, her muff dancing in the air before her as she went."
"C’est du côté de Méséglise, à Montjouvain, maison située au bord d’une grande mare et adossée à un talus buissonneux que demeurait M. Vinteuil. Aussi croisait-on souvent sur la route sa fille, conduisant un buggy à toute allure. À partir d’une certaine année on ne la rencontra plus seule, mais avec une amie plus âgée, qui avait mauvaise réputation dans le pays et qui un jour s’installa définitivement à Montjouvain. On disait : « Faut-il que ce pauvre M. Vinteuil soit aveuglé par la tendresse pour ne pas s’apercevoir de ce qu’on raconte, et permettre à sa fille, lui qui se scandalise d’une parole déplacée, de faire vivre sous son toit une femme pareille. Il dit que c’est une femme supérieure, un grand cœur et qu’elle aurait eu des dispositions extraordinaires pour la musique si elle les avait cultivées. Il peut être sûr que ce n’est pas de musique qu’elle s’occupe avec sa fille. » M.","It was on the side of Méséglise, in Montjouvain, a house located on the edge of a large pond and backed by a bushy embankment that Mr. Vinteuil lived. So we often met his daughter on the road, driving a buggy at full speed. After a certain year she was no longer seen alone, but with an older friend, who had a bad reputation in the country and who one day settled permanently in Montjouvain. They said: ""Must poor M. Vinteuil be blinded by tenderness so as not to notice what is being said, and allow his daughter, who is scandalized by an inappropriate word, to keep alive under his roof such a woman.

He can be sure that it is not music that she deals with with her daughter. » Mr.","It was along the Méséglise way, at Montjouvain, a house situated at the edge of a large pond and backed up against a brush-covered hillock, that M. Vinteuil lived. And so we often met his daughter on the road driving a cabriolet at top speed. One year, she was not alone when we met her, and from then on she was always accompanied by an older friend, a woman who had a bad reputation in the area and who one day moved permanently into Montjouvain. People said: “Poor M. Vinteuil must be blind with love not to realize what kind of rumors are going around—a man who is shocked by a single remark out of place letting his daughter bring a woman like that to live under his roof.

He can be sure she’s not dabbling in music when she’s with his daughter.”","It was along the 'Méséglise way,' at Montjouvain, a house built on the edge of a large pond, and overlooked by a steep, shrub-grown hill, that M. Vinteuil lived. And so we used often to meet his daughter driving her dogcart at full speed along the road. After a certain year we never saw her alone, but always accompanied by a friend, a girl older than herself, with an evil reputation in the neighbourhood, who in the end installed herself permanently, one day, at Montjouvain. People said: ""That poor M. Vinteuil must be blinded by love not to see what everyone is talking about, and to let his daughter—a man who is horrified if you use a word in the wrong sense—bring a woman like that to live under his roof.

"Jadis ayant souvent pensé avec terreur qu’un jour il cesserait d’être épris d’Odette, il s’était promis d’être vigilant, et dès qu’il sentirait que son amour commencerait à le quitter, de s’accrocher à lui, de le retenir. Mais voici qu’à l’affaiblissement de son amour correspondait simultanément un affaiblissement du désir de rester amoureux. Car on ne peut pas changer, c’est-à-dire devenir une autre personne, tout en continuant à obéir aux sentiments de celle qu’on n’est plus. Parfois le nom, aperçu dans un journal, d’un des hommes qu’il supposait avoir pu être les amants d’Odette, lui redonnait de la jalousie. Mais elle était bien légère et comme elle lui prouvait qu’il n’était pas encore complètement sorti de ce temps où il avait tant souffert – mais aussi où il avait connu une manière de sentir si voluptueuse – et que les hasards de la route lui permettraient peut-être d’en apercevoir encore furtivement et de loin les beautés, cette jalousie lui procurait plutôt une excitation agréable comme au morne Parisien qui quitte Venise pour retrouver la France, un dernier moustique prouve que l’Italie et l’été ne sont pas encore bien loin. Mais le plus souvent le temps si particulier de sa vie d’où il sortait, quand il faisait effort sinon pour y rester, du moins pour en avoir une vision claire pendant qu’il le pouvait encore, il s’apercevait qu’il ne le pouvait déjà plus ; il aurait voulu apercevoir comme un paysage qui allait disparaître cet amour qu’il venait de quitter ; mais il est si difficile d’être double et de se donner le spectacle véridique d’un sentiment qu’on a cessé de posséder, que bientôt l’obscurité se faisant dans son cerveau, il ne voyait plus rien, renonçait à regarder, retirait son lorgnon, en essuyait les verres ; et il se disait qu’il valait mieux se reposer un peu, qu’il serait encore temps tout à l’heure, et se rencognait, avec l’incuriosité, dans l’engourdissement du voyageur ensommeillé qui rabat son chapeau sur ses yeux pour dormir dans le wagon qu’il sent l’entraîner de plus en plus vite, loin du pays où il a si longtemps vécu et qu’il s’était promis de ne pas laisser fuir sans lui donner un dernier adieu. Même, comme ce voyageur s’il se réveille seulement en France, quand Swann ramassa par hasard près de lui la preuve que Forcheville avait été l’amant d’Odette, il s’aperçut qu’il n’en ressentait aucune douleur, que l’amour était loin maintenant et regretta de n’avoir pas été averti du moment où il le quittait pour toujours. Et de même qu’avant d’embrasser Odette pour la première fois il avait cherché à imprimer dans sa mémoire le visage qu’elle avait eu si longtemps pour lui et qu’allait transformer le souvenir de ce baiser, de même il eût voulu, en pensée au moins, avoir pu faire ses adieux, pendant qu’elle existait encore, à cette Odette lui inspirant de l’amour, de la jalousie, à cette Odette lui causant des souffrances et que maintenant il ne reverrait jamais.","Formerly having often thought with terror that one day he would cease to be in love with Odette, he had promised himself to be vigilant, and as soon as he felt that his love was beginning to leave him, to cling to him. , to retain it. But now the weakening of his love was simultaneously matched by a weakening of the desire to remain in love. Because we cannot change, that is to say become another person, while continuing to obey the feelings of the one we are no longer. Sometimes the name, seen in a newspaper, of one of the men whom he supposed to have been Odette's lovers, made him jealous again. But it was very light and as it proved to him that he was not yet completely out of that time when he had suffered so much - but also when he had known such a voluptuous way of feeling - and that the hazards of the road would perhaps still make it possible to see its beauties furtively and from afar, this jealousy rather gave him a pleasant excitement like the dreary Parisian who leaves Venice to return to France, a last mosquito proves that Italy and summer are not not far yet. But more often than not, the very special time of his life when he was coming out of, when he made an effort if not to stay there, at least to have a clear vision of it while he still could, he realized that he already couldn't; he would have liked to see, like a landscape which was about to disappear, this love which he had just left; but it is so difficult to be double and to give oneself the truthful spectacle of a feeling which one has ceased to possess, that soon darkness settling in his brain, he no longer saw anything, gave up looking, withdrew his lorgnette, wiped the glasses; and he said to himself that it would be better to rest a little, that there would still be time presently, and he cringed, incuriously, in the numbness of the sleepy traveler who pulls his hat over his eyes to sleeping in the car which he feels is dragging him faster and faster, far from the country where he has lived for so long and which he had promised himself not to let escape without giving him a final farewell. Even, like that traveler if he only wakes up in France, when Swann happened to pick up near him the proof that Forcheville had been Odette's lover, he realized that he felt no pain about it, that love was far away now and wished he had been told when he was leaving him forever. And just as before kissing Odette for the first time he had tried to imprint on his memory the face she had had for him for so long and which the memory of that kiss would transform, so he would have liked, in thought at least, having been able to say goodbye, while she still existed, to this Odette inspiring him with love, jealousy, this Odette causing him suffering and whom now he would never see again.","In the past having often thought with terror that one day he would cease to be in love with Odette, he had promised himself to be vigilant and, as soon as he felt his love was beginning to leave him, to cling to it, to hold it back. But now to the weakening of his love there corresponded a simultaneous weakening of his desire to remain in love. For one cannot change, that is to say become another person, while continuing to acquiesce to the feelings of the person one has ceased to be. Now and then the name, glimpsed in a newspaper, of one of the men he thought could have been Odette’s lovers, restored his jealousy to him. But it was very mild and as it proved to him that he had not yet completely emerged from the time when he had suffered so much—but also when he had experienced such voluptuous feelings—and that the hazards of the road ahead might still permit him to catch a furtive, distant glimpse of its beauties, this jealousy actually gave him a pleasant thrill just as to the sad Parisian leaving Venice to return to France a last mosquito proves that Italy and the summer are not yet too remote. But most often, when he made the effort, if not to remain in this quite distinctive period of his life from which he was emerging, at least to have a clear view of it while he still could, he would notice that already he no longer could; he would have liked to observe, as though it were a landscape about to disappear, that love which he had just left behind; but it is so difficult to duplicate oneself and give oneself a truthful display of a feeling one no longer has that soon , darkness gathering in his brain, he could no longer see anything, gave up looking, took off his lorgnon, wiped its lenses; and he said to himself that it would be better to rest a little, that there would still be time later on, and would settle back with the incuriosity, the torpor of the drowsy traveler who pulls his hat down over his eyes in order to sleep in the railway carriage which he feels carrying him faster and faster away from the country where he has lived for so long and which he had promised himself not to let slip past without giving it a last farewell. Indeed, like the same traveler if he does not wake until he is back in France, when Swann happened upon proof close at hand that Forcheville had been Odette’s lover, he observed that he felt no pain, that his love was far away by now, and he was sorry not to have been warned of the moment when he was about to leave it behind forever. And just as before kissing Odette for the first time he had tried to imprint on his memory the face which had been familiar to him for so long and which was about to be transformed by the memory of that kiss, so he would have wanted, in his thoughts at least, to have been able to make his farewells, while she still existed, to the Odette who had inspired him with love, jealousy, to the Odette who had made him suffer and whom he would now never see again.","In former times, having often thought with terror that a day must come when he would cease to be in love with Odette, he had determined to keep a sharp look-out, and as soon as he felt that love was beginning to escape him, to cling tightly to it and to hold it back. But now, to the faintness of his love there corresponded a simultaneous faintness in his desire to remain her lover. For a man cannot change, that is to say become another person, while he continues to obey the dictates of the self which he has ceased to be. Occasionally the name, if it caught his eye in a newspaper, of one of the men whom he supposed to have been Odette's lovers, reawakened his jealousy. But it was very slight, and, inasmuch as it proved to him that he had not completely emerged from that period in which he had so keenly suffered—though in it he had also known a way of feeling so intensely happy—and that the accidents of his course might still enable him to catch an occasional glimpse, stealthily and at a distance, of its beauties, this jealousy gave him, if anything, an agreeable thrill, as to the sad Parisian, when he has left Venice behind him and must return to France, a last mosquito proves that Italy and summer are still not too remote. But, as a rule, with this particular period of his life from which he was emerging, when he made an effort, if not to remain in it, at least to obtain, while still he might, an uninterrupted view of it, he discovered that already it was too late; he would have looked back to distinguish, as it might be a landscape that was about to disappear, that love from which he had departed, but it is so difficult to enter into a state of complete duality and to present to oneself the lifelike spectacle of a feeling which one has ceased to possess, that very soon, the clouds gathering in his brain, he could see nothing, he would abandon the attempt, would take the glasses from his nose and wipe them; and he told himself that he would do better to rest for a little, that there would be time enough later on, and settled back into his corner with as little curiosity, with as much torpor as the drowsy traveller who pulls his cap down over his eyes so as to get some sleep in the railway-carriage that is drawing him, he feels, faster and faster, out of the country in which he has lived for so long, and which he vowed that he would not allow to slip away from him without looking out to bid it a last farewell. Indeed, like the same traveller, if he does not awake until he has crossed the frontier and is again in France, when Swann happened to alight, close at hand, upon something which proved that Forcheville had been Odette's lover, he discovered that it caused him no pain, that love was now utterly remote, and he regretted that he had had no warning of the moment in which he had emerged from it for ever. And just as, before kissing Odette for the first time, he had sought to imprint upon his memory the face that for so long had been familiar, before it was altered by the additional memory of their kiss, so he could have wished—in thought at least—to have been in a position to bid farewell, while she still existed, to that Odette who had inspired love in him and jealousy, to that Odette who had caused him so to suffer, and whom now he would never see again."
"Puis, nous poursuivions notre route jusque devant leur porte cochère où un concierge différent de tout concierge, et pénétré jusque dans les galons de sa livrée du même charme douloureux que j’avais ressenti dans le nom de Gilberte, avait l’air de savoir que j’étais de ceux à qui une indignité originelle interdirait toujours de pénétrer dans la vie mystérieuse qu’il était chargé de garder et sur laquelle les fenêtres de l’entresol paraissaient conscientes d’être refermées, ressemblant beaucoup moins entre la noble retombée de leurs rideaux de mousseline à n’importe quelles autres fenêtres, qu’aux regards de Gilberte. D’autres fois nous allions sur les boulevards et je me postais à l’entrée de la rue Duphot ; on m’avait dit qu’on pouvait souvent y voir passer Swann se rendant chez son dentiste ; et mon imagination différenciait tellement le père de Gilberte du reste de l’humanité, sa présence au milieu du monde réel y introduisait tant de merveilleux, que, avant même d’arriver à la Madeleine, j’étais ému à la pensée d’approcher d’une rue où pouvait se produire inopinément l’apparition surnaturelle.","Then we continued on our way to their porte-cochere where a concierge different from any concierge, and imbued even in the stripes of his livery with the same painful charm that I had felt in the name of Gilberte, seemed to know that I was one of those to whom an original indignity would always prohibit from entering the mysterious life that he was responsible for keeping and on which the windows of the entresol seemed aware of being closed, resembling much less between the noble fallout of their muslin curtains at any other windows, except in view of Gilberte. Other times we went to the boulevards and I posted myself at the entrance to rue Duphot; I had been told that Swann could often be seen passing there on his way to his dentist; and my imagination so differentiated Gilberte's father from the rest of humanity, his presence in the midst of the real world introduced so many marvels into it, that even before arriving at the Madeleine, I was moved by the thought of approaching of a street where the supernatural apparition could occur unexpectedly.","Then we would continue on our way until we reached their carriage entrance, where a concierge different from any other concierge, and steeped even to the braid of his livery in the same painful charm I had felt in the name Gilberte, seemed to know that I was one of those people whom a primordial unworthiness would prohibit forever from penetrating into the mysterious life that he was charged with guarding and on which the windows of the entresol seemed conscious of being closed, resembling far less, between the stately fall of their muslin curtains, any other windows than they did Gilberte’s own eyes. At other times, we would go down the boulevards and I would take up a position at the corner of the rue Duphot; I had been told that here one could often see Swann going past on his way to the dentist; and my imagination so differentiated Gilberte’s father from the rest of humanity, his presence in the midst of the real world introduced into it such magic, that, even before I reached the Madeleine, I was moved at the thought of approaching a street where I might suddenly encounter that supernatural apparition.","and we would continue on our way until we reached their gate, where a porter, different from every other porter in the world, and saturated, even to the braid on his livery, with the same melancholy charm that I had felt to be latent in the name of Gilberte, looked at me as though he knew that I was one of those whose natural unworthiness would for ever prevent them from penetrating into the mysteries of the life inside, which it was his duty to guard, and over which the ground-floor windows appeared conscious of being protectingly closed, with far less resemblance, between the nobly sweeping arches of their muslin curtains, to any other windows in the world than to Gilberte's glancing eyes. On other days we would go along the boulevards, and I would post myself at the corner of the Rue Duphot; I had heard that Swann was often to be seen passing there, on his way to the dentist's; and my imagination so far differentiated Gilberte's father from the rest of humanity, his presence in the midst of a crowd of real people introduced among them so miraculous an element, that even before we reached the Madeleine I would be trembling with emotion at the thought that I was approaching a street from which that supernatural apparition might at any moment burst upon me unawares."

"À quelques pas, un grand gaillard en livrée rêvait, immobile, sculptural, inutile, comme ce guerrier purement décoratif qu’on voit dans les tableaux les plus tumultueux de Mantegna, songer, appuyé sur son bouclier, tandis qu’on se précipite et qu’on s’égorge à côté de lui ; détaché du groupe de ses camarades qui s’empressaient autour de Swann, il semblait aussi résolu à se désintéresser de cette scène, qu’il suivait vaguement de ses yeux glauques et cruels, que si ç’eût été le massacre des Innocents ou le martyre de saint Jacques. Il semblait précisément appartenir à cette race disparue – ou qui peut-être n’exista jamais que dans le retable de San Zeno et les fresques des Eremitani où Swann l’avait approchée et où elle rêve encore – issue de la fécondation d’une statue antique par quelque modèle padouan du Maître ou quelque saxon d’Albert Dürer. Et les mèches de ses cheveux roux crespelés par la nature, mais collés par la brillantine, étaient largement traitées comme elles sont dans la sculpture grecque qu’étudiait sans cesse le peintre de Mantoue, et qui, si dans la création elle ne figure que l’homme, sait du moins tirer de ses simples formes des richesses si variées et comme empruntées à toute la nature vivante, qu’une chevelure, par l’enroulement lisse et les becs aigus de ses boucles, ou dans la superposition du triple et fleurissant diadème de ses tresses, a l’air à la fois d’un paquet d’algues, d’une nichée de colombes, d’un bandeau de jacinthes et d’une torsade de serpents.","A few steps away, a tall fellow in livery dreamed, motionless, sculptural, useless, like that purely decorative warrior one sees in the most tumultuous pictures of Mantegna, leaning on his shield, dreaming, while one rushes and people cut their throats next to him; detached from the group of his comrades who crowded around Swann, he seemed as determined to lose interest in this scene, which he vaguely followed with his glaucous and cruel eyes, as if it had been the massacre of the Innocents or the martyrdom of Saint James. He seemed to belong precisely to that race which disappeared – or which perhaps never existed except in the altarpiece of San Zeno and the frescoes of the Eremitani where Swann had approached her and where she still dreams – resulting from the fertilization of a statue antique by some Paduan model of the Master or some Saxon of Albert Dürer. And the locks of her red hair crimped by nature, but glued together with brilliantine, were largely treated as they are in the Greek sculpture which the painter of Mantua constantly studied, and which, if in creation it only figures man, at least knows how to draw from his simple forms riches so varied and as if borrowed from all living nature, that a hair, by the smooth winding and the sharp beaks of its curls, or in the superposition of the triple and flowering diadem of her braids, looks at once a bundle of seaweed, a brood of doves, a band of hyacinths and a twist of serpents.","A few steps away, a sturdy fellow in livery mused motionless, statuesque, useless, like the purely decorative warrior one sees in the most tumultuous paintings by Mantegna,90 lost in thought, leaning on his shield, while others beside him rush forward and slaughter one another; detached from his group of companions as they pressed around Swann, he seemed as resolved to take no part in this scene, which he followed vaguely with his cruel sea-green eyes, as if it were the Massacre of the Innocents or the Martyrdom of Saint John. He seemed in fact to belong to that race which has vanished—or which perhaps never existed except in the altarpiece of San Zeno and the frescoes of the Erimitani, where Swann had encountered it and where it dreams on still—and which issued from the impregnation of an ancient statue by one of the Master’s Paduan models or some Albrecht Dürer Saxon.91 And the locks of his red hair, crimped by nature but glued by brilliantine, were treated broadly as they are in the Greek sculpture which the painter from Mantua studied so constantly and which, if out of all creation it depicts only man, is at least able to derive from his simple forms richnesses so varied, as though borrowed from all of living nature, that a head of hair, in the smooth rolls and sharp beaks of its curls, or in the superimposition of the threefold flowering diadem of its tresses, looks at once like a bundle of seaweed, a nestful of doves, a band of hyacinths, and a coil of snakes.","A few feet away, a strapping great lad in livery stood musing, motionless, statuesque, useless, like that purely decorative warrior whom one sees in the most tumultuous of Mantegna's paintings, lost in dreams, leaning upon his shield, while all around him are fighting and bloodshed and death; detached from the group of his companions who were thronging about Swann, he seemed as determined to remain unconcerned in the scene, which he followed vaguely with his cruel, greenish eyes, as if it had been the Massacre of the Innocents or the Martyrdom of Saint James. He seemed precisely to have sprung from that vanished race—if, indeed, it ever existed, save in the reredos of San Zeno and the frescoes of the Eremitani, where Swann had come in contact with it, and where it still dreams—fruit of the impregnation of a classical statue by some one of the Master's Paduan models, or of Albert Duerer's Saxons. And the locks of his reddish hair, crinkled by nature, but glued to his head by brilliantine, were treated broadly as they are in that Greek sculpture which the Mantuan painter never ceased to study, and which, if in its creator's purpose it represents but man, manages at least to extract from man's simple outlines such a variety of richness, borrowed, as it were, from the whole of animated nature, that a head of hair, by the glossy undulation and beak-like points of its curls, or in the overlaying of the florid triple diadem of its brushed tresses, can suggest at once a bunch of seaweed, a brood of fledgling doves, a bed of hyacinths and a serpent's writhing back."
"Et elle ajouta encore un instant après, avec colère : – Non, mais voyez-vous, cette sale bête ! employant sans s’en rendre compte, et peut-être en obéissant au même besoin obscur de se justifier – comme Françoise à Combray quand le poulet ne voulait pas mourir – les mots qu’arrachent les derniers sursauts d’un animal inoffensif qui agonise au paysan qui est en train de l’écraser.","And she added a moment later, angrily: – No, but you see, that filthy beast! using without realizing it, and perhaps obeying the same obscure need to justify itself – like Françoise at Combray when the chicken did not want to die – the words torn from the last gasps of a harmless animal dying in the peasant who is crushing it.","And she also added, a moment later, angrily: “No, really, the vile creature!” using, without realizing it, and perhaps responding to the same obscure need to justify herself—like Françoise at Combray when the chicken did not want to die—the same words which the last twitches of an inoffensive animal in its death throes wring from the countryman who is killing it.","A moment later she added, inarticulate with rage: ""No, but, don't you see, the filthy creature..."" using unconsciously, and perhaps in satisfaction of the same obscure need to justify herself—like Françoise at Combray when the chicken refused to die—the very words which the last convulsions of an inoffensive animal in its death agony wring from the peasant who is engaged in taking its life."
"Swann retrouva rapidement le sentiment de la laideur masculine, quand, au delà de la tenture de tapisserie, au spectacle des domestiques succéda celui des invités. Mais cette laideur même de visages, qu’il connaissait pourtant si bien, lui semblait neuve depuis que leurs traits – au lieu d’être pour lui des signes pratiquement utilisables à l’identification de telle personne qui lui avait représenté jusque-là un faisceau de plaisirs à poursuivre, d’ennuis à éviter, ou de politesses à rendre – reposaient, coordonnés seulement par des rapports esthétiques, dans l’autonomie de leurs lignes. Et en ces hommes, au milieu desquels Swann se trouva enserré, il n’était pas jusqu’aux monocles que beaucoup portaient (et qui, autrefois, auraient tout au plus permis à Swann de dire qu’ils portaient un monocle), qui, déliés maintenant de signifier une habitude, la même pour tous, ne lui apparussent chacun avec une sorte d’individualité. Peut-être parce qu’il ne regarda le général de Froberville et le marquis de Bréauté qui causaient dans l’entrée que comme deux personnages dans un tableau, alors qu’ils avaient été longtemps pour lui les amis utiles qui l’avaient présenté au Jockey et assisté dans des duels, le monocle du général, resté entre ses paupières comme un éclat d’obus dans sa figure vulgaire, balafrée et triomphale, au milieu du front qu’il éborgnait comme l’œil unique du cyclope, apparut à Swann comme une blessure monstrueuse qu’il pouvait être glorieux d’avoir reçue, mais qu’il était indécent d’exhiber ; tandis que celui que M. de Bréauté ajoutait, en signe de festivité, aux gants gris perle, au « gibus », à la cravate blanche et substituait au binocle familier (comme faisait Swann lui-même) pour aller dans le monde, portait collé à son revers, comme une préparation d’histoire naturelle sous un microscope, un regard infinitésimal et grouillant d’amabilité, qui ne cessait de sourire à la hauteur des plafonds, à la beauté des fêtes, à l’intérêt des programmes et à la qualité des rafraîchissements.","Swann quickly rediscovered the feeling of masculine ugliness when, beyond the tapestry hanging, the spectacle of the servants was followed by that of the guests. But this very ugliness of faces, which he nevertheless knew so well, seemed new to him since their features - instead of being for him signs practically usable for the identification of such a person who had hitherto represented to him a beam pleasures to pursue, annoyances to avoid, or courtesies to return – rested, coordinated only by aesthetic relations, in the autonomy of their lines. And in these men, among whom Swann found himself hemmed in, it was not down to the monocles that many wore (and which, in the past, would at most have allowed Swann to say that they wore a monocle), who, freed now from signifying a habit, the same for all, each appeared to him with a kind of individuality. Perhaps because he only looked at General de Froberville and the Marquis de Bréauté, who were chatting in the entrance like two characters in a picture, whereas they had long been useful friends for him who had introduced him to the Jockey and assisted in duels, the general's monocle, remaining between his eyelids like a shrapnel in his vulgar, scarred and triumphant face, in the middle of the forehead which he glared like the single eye of the cyclops, appeared to Swann like a monstrous wound which he might be glorious to have received, but which it was indecent to exhibit; while the one that M. de Bréauté added, as a sign of festivity, to pearl gray gloves, to the ""gibus"", to the white tie and substituted for the familiar glasses (as Swann himself did) to go out in society, wore glued on the other hand, like a preparation of natural history under a microscope, an infinitesimal look teeming with friendliness, which never stopped smiling at the height of the ceilings, the beauty of the holidays, the interest of the programs and the quality of refreshments.","Swann rapidly recovered his sense of how ugly men could be, when, beyond the tapestry hangings, the spectacle of the servants was followed by that of the guests. But even the ugliness of these faces, though he knew it so well, seemed new to him since their features—instead of being signs usable in a practical way for the identification of a certain person who had until then represented a cluster of pleasures to pursue, worries to avoid, or courtesies to pay—now remained coordinated only by aesthetic relations, within the autonomy of their lines. And of these men in whose midst Swann found himself hemmed in, even the monocles which many wore (and which, formerly, would at the very most have allowed Swann to say that they wore a monocle), having now been released from signifying a habit, the same for everyone, appeared to him each with a sort of individuality. Maybe because he did not regard Général de Froberville and the Marquis de Bréauté, who were talking to each other just inside the door, as more than two figures in a painting, whereas for a long time they had been useful friends who had introduced him to the Jockey Club and supported him in duels, the general’s monocle, stuck between his eyelids like a shell splinter in his vulgar, scarred, overbearing face, in the middle of a forehead which it blinded like the Cyclops’ single eye, appeared to Swann like a monstrous wound that might have been glorious to receive, but was indecent to show off; whereas the one that M. de Bréauté added, as a badge of festivity, to the pearl-gray gloves, the opera hat, and the white tie, and substituted for the familiar lorgnette (as Swann himself did) for going out in society, bore, glued to its other side, like a natural history specimen under a microscope, an infinitesimal gaze teeming with friendliness that smiled constantly at the loftiness of the ceilings, the beauty of the preparations, the interest of the programs, and the excellence of the refreshments.","He speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human male when, on the other side of the tapestry curtain, the spectacle of the servants gave place to that of the guests. But even this ugliness of faces, which of course were mostly familiar to him, seemed something new and uncanny, now that their features,—instead of being to him symbols of practical utility in the identification of this or that man, who until then had represented merely so many pleasures to be sought after, boredoms to be avoided, or courtesies to be acknowledged—were at rest, measurable by aesthetic co-ordinates alone, in the autonomy of their curves and angles. And in these men, in the thick of whom Swann now found himself packed, there was nothing (even to the monocle which many of them wore, and which, previously, would, at the most, have enabled Swann to say that so-and-so wore a monocle) which, no longer restricted to the general connotation of a habit, the same in all of them , did not now strike him with a sense of individuality in each. Perhaps because he did not regard General de Froberville and the Marquis de Bréaute, who were talking together just inside the door, as anything more than two figures in a picture, whereas they were the old and useful friends who had put him up for the Jockey Club and had supported him in duels, the General's monocle, stuck like a shell-splinter in his common, scarred, victorious, overbearing face, in the middle of a forehead which it left half-blinded, like the single-eyed flashing front of the Cyclops, appeared to Swann as a monstrous wound which it might have been glorious to receive but which it was certainly not decent to expose, while that which M. de Bréaute wore, as a festive badge, with his pearl-grey gloves, his crush hat and white tie, substituting it for the familiar pair of glasses (as Swann himself did) when he went out to places, bore, glued to its other side, like a specimen prepared on a slide for the microscope, an infinitesimal gaze that swarmed with friendly feeling and never ceased to twinkle at the loftiness of ceilings, the delightfulness of parties, the interestingness of programmes and the excellence of refreshments."
"Le monocle du marquis de Forestelle était minuscule, n’avait aucune bordure et, obligeant à une crispation incessante et douloureuse l’œil où il s’incrustait comme un cartilage superflu dont la présence est inexplicable et la matière recherchée, il donnait au visage du marquis une délicatesse mélancolique, et le faisait juger par les femmes comme capable de grands chagrins d’amour. Mais celui de M. de Saint-Candé, entouré d’un gigantesque anneau, comme Saturne, était le centre de gravité d’une figure qui s’ordonnait à tout moment par rapport à lui, dont le nez frémissant et rouge et la bouche lippue et sarcastique tâchaient par leurs grimaces d’être à la hauteur des feux roulants d’esprit dont étincelait le disque de verre, et se voyait préférer aux plus beaux regards du monde par des jeunes femmes snobs et dépravées qu’il faisait rêver de charmes artificiels et d’un raffinement de volupté ; et cependant, derrière le sien, M. de Palancy qui, avec sa grosse tête de carpe aux yeux ronds, se déplaçait lentement au milieu des fêtes en desserrant d’instant en instant ses mandibules comme pour chercher son orientation, avait l’air de transporter seulement avec lui un fragment accidentel, et peut-être purement symbolique, du vitrage de son aquarium, partie destinée à figurer le tout qui rappela à Swann, grand admirateur des Vices et des Vertus de Giotto à Padoue, cet Injuste à côté duquel un rameau feuillu évoque les forêts où se cache son repaire.","The Marquis de Forestelle's monocle was tiny, had no edge and, forcing an incessant and painful twitching of the eye where it was embedded like superfluous cartilage whose presence is inexplicable and the material sought, it gave the face of the marquis a melancholy delicacy, and made him judge by women as capable of great sorrows of love. But that of M. de Saint-Candé, surrounded by a gigantic ring, like Saturn, was the center of gravity of a figure which arranged itself at all times in relation to him, whose quivering red nose and mouth lippue and sarcastic tried by their grimaces to be at the height of the rolling fires of spirit which sparkled the glass disc, and saw themselves preferred to the most beautiful looks in the world by young snobs and depraved women whom he made dream of charms artificial and voluptuous refinement; and yet, behind his, M. de Palancy, who, with his big carp head with round eyes, moved slowly through the festivities, unclenching his jaws from moment to moment as if to seek his direction, seemed to carrying with him only an accidental fragment, and perhaps purely symbolic, of the glazing of his aquarium, part intended to represent the whole which reminded Swann, a great admirer of the Vices and Virtues of Giotto in Padua, this Unjust beside whom a leafy branch evokes the forests where its lair is hidden.","The Marquis de Forestelle’s monocle was minuscule, had no border, and, requiring a constant painful clenching of the eye, where it was encrusted like a superfluous cartilage whose presence was inexplicable and whose material was exquisite, gave the Marquis’s face a melancholy delicacy, and made women think he was capable of great sorrows in love. But that of M. de Saint-Candé, surrounded by a gigantic ring, like Saturn, was the center of gravity of a face which regulated itself at each moment in relation to it, a face whose quivering red nose and thick-lipped sarcastic mouth attempted by their grimaces to equal the unceasing salvos of wit sparkling from the disk of glass, and saw itself preferred to the handsomest eyes in the world by snobbish and depraved young women in whom it inspired dreams of artificial charms and a refinement of voluptuousness; and meanwhile, behind his own, M. de Palancy, who, with his big, round-eyed carp’s head, moved about slowly in the midst of the festivities unclenching his mandibles from moment to moment as though seeking to orient himself, merely seemed to be transporting with him an accidental and perhaps purely symbolic fragment of the glass of his aquarium, a part intended to represent the whole, reminding Swann, a great admirer of Giotto’s Vices and Virtues at Padua, of Injustice, next to whom a leafy bough evokes the forests in which his lair is hidden.","The Marquis de Forestelle's monocle was minute and rimless, and, by enforcing an incessant and painful contraction of the eye over which it was incrusted like a superfluous cartilage, the presence of which there was inexplicable and its substance unimaginable, it gave to his face a melancholy refinement, and led women to suppose him capable of suffering terribly when in love. But that of M. de Saint-Candé, girdled, like Saturn, with an enormous ring, was the centre of gravity of a face which composed itself afresh every moment in relation to the glass, while his thrusting red nose and swollen sarcastic lips endeavoured by their grimaces to rise to the level of the steady flame of wit that sparkled in the polished disk, and saw itself preferred to the most ravishing eyes in the world by the smart, depraved young women whom it set dreaming of artificial charms and a refinement of sensual bliss; and then, behind him, M. de Palancy, who with his huge carp's head and goggling eyes moved slowly up and down the stream of festive gatherings, unlocking his great mandibles at every moment as though in search of his orientation, had the air of carrying about upon his person only an accidental and perhaps purely symbolical fragment of the glass wall of his aquarium, a part intended to suggest the whole which recalled to Swann, a fervent admirer of Giotto's Vices and Virtues at Padua, that Injustice by whose side a leafy bough evokes the idea of the forests that enshroud his secret lair."

"Je me rendormais, et parfois je n’avais plus que de courts réveils d’un instant, le temps d’entendre les craquements organiques des boiseries, d’ouvrir les yeux pour fixer le kaléidoscope de l’obscurité, de goûter grâce à une lueur momentanée de conscience le sommeil où étaient plongés les meubles, la chambre, le tout dont je n’étais qu’une petite partie et à l’insensibilité duquel je retournais vite m’unir. Ou bien en dormant j’avais rejoint sans effort un âge à jamais révolu de ma vie primitive, retrouvé telle de mes terreurs enfantines comme celle que mon grand-oncle me tirât par mes boucles et qu’avait dissipée le jour – date pour moi d’une ère nouvelle – où on les avait coupées. J’avais oublié cet événement pendant mon sommeil, j’en retrouvais le souvenir aussitôt que j’avais réussi à m’éveiller pour échapper aux mains de mon grand-oncle, mais par mesure de précaution j’entourais complètement ma tête de mon oreiller avant de retourner dans le monde des rêves.","I would go back to sleep, and sometimes I would only have short, momentary awakenings, the time to hear the organic creaks of the woodwork, to open my eyes to stare at the kaleidoscope of darkness, to taste thanks to a momentary glimmer of consciousness the sleep in which the furniture, the bedroom, the whole of which I was only a small part and whose insensitivity I quickly returned to unite myself, were plunged. Or else while sleeping I had effortlessly rejoined an age of my primitive life that would be gone forever, rediscovered one of my childish terrors like that of my great-uncle pulling me by my curls and which the day had dissipated – a date for me. a new era – where they had been cut off. I had forgotten this event during my sleep, I found the memory of it as soon as I had managed to wake up to escape the hands of my great-uncle, but as a precautionary measure I completely surrounded my head with my pillow. before returning to the dream world.","I would go back to sleep, and would sometimes afterward wake again for brief moments only, long enough to hear the organic creak of the woodwork, open my eyes and stare at the kaleidoscope of the darkness, savor in a momentary glimmer of consciousness the sleep into which were plunged the furniture, the room, that whole of which I was only a small part and whose insensibility I would soon return to share. Or else while sleeping I had effortlessly returned to a period of my early life that had ended forever, rediscovered one of my childish terrors such as my great-uncle pulling me by my curls, a terror dispelled on the day—the dawn for me of a new era—when they were cut off.

Or, perhaps, while I was asleep I had returned without the least effort to an earlier stage in my life, now for ever outgrown; and had come under the thrall of one of my childish terrors, such as that old terror of my great-uncle's pulling my curls, which was effectually dispelled on the day—the dawn of a new era to me—on which they were finally cropped from my head. I had forgotten that event during my sleep; I remembered it again immediately I had succeeded in making myself wake up to escape my great-uncle's fingers; still, as a measure of precaution, I would bury the whole of my head in the pillow before returning to the world of dreams."
"Françoise, regardez-moi ce nuage noir derrière le clocher et ce mauvais soleil sur les ardoises, bien sûr que la journée ne se passera pas sans pluie.

"Et ma pensée n’était-elle pas aussi comme une autre crèche au fond de laquelle je sentais que je restais enfoncé, même pour regarder ce qui se passait au dehors ? Quand je voyais un objet extérieur, la conscience que je le voyais restait entre moi et lui, le bordait d’un mince liseré spirituel qui m’empêchait de jamais toucher directement sa matière ; elle se volatilisait en quelque sorte avant que je prisse contact avec elle, comme un corps incandescent qu’on approche d’un objet mouillé ne touche pas son humidité parce qu’il se fait toujours précéder d’une zone d’évaporation. Dans l’espèce d’écran diapré d’états différents que, tandis que je lisais, déployait simultanément ma conscience, et qui allaient des aspirations les plus profondément cachées en moi-même jusqu’à la vision tout extérieure de l’horizon que j’avais, au bout du jardin, sous les yeux, ce qu’il y avait d’abord en moi de plus intime, la poignée sans cesse en mouvement qui gouvernait le reste, c’était ma croyance en la richesse philosophique, en la beauté du livre que je lisais, et mon désir de me les approprier, quel que fût ce livre. Car, même si je l’avais acheté à Combray, en l’apercevant devant l’épicerie Borange, trop distante de la maison pour que Françoise pût s’y fournir comme chez Camus, mais mieux achalandée comme papeterie et librairie, retenu par des ficelles dans la mosaïque des brochures et des livraisons qui revêtaient les deux vantaux de sa porte plus mystérieuse, plus semée de pensées qu’une porte de cathédrale, c’est que je l’avais reconnu pour m’avoir été cité comme un ouvrage remarquable par le professeur ou le camarade qui me paraissait à cette époque détenir le secret de la vérité et de la beauté à demi pressenties, à demi incompréhensibles, dont la connaissance était le but vague mais permanent de ma pensée.","And wasn't my thought also like another manger in the depths of which I felt that I remained buried, even to look at what was happening outside? When I saw an external object, the consciousness that I saw it remained between me and it, bordering it with a thin spiritual border which prevented me from ever directly touching its matter; it volatilized in a way before I made contact with it, as an incandescent body that one approaches a wet object does not touch its humidity because it is always preceded by a zone of evaporation. In the sort of variegated screen of different states which, while I was reading, my consciousness simultaneously unfolded, and which ranged from the most deeply hidden aspirations within myself to the quite external vision of the horizon which I I had, at the end of the garden, before my eyes, what was most intimate in me at first, the constantly moving handful that governed the rest, it was my belief in philosophical richness, in the beauty of the book I was reading, and my desire to make them my own, whatever that book was. Because, even if I had bought it at Combray, when I saw it in front of the Borange grocery store, too far from the house for Françoise to be able to get supplies there like at Camus', but better stocked as a stationery and bookshop, retained by strings in the mosaic of brochures and deliveries that covered the two leaves of its more mysterious door, more strewn with thoughts than a cathedral door, is that I had recognized it for having been cited to me as a remarkable work by the professor or the comrade who seemed to me at that time to hold the secret of half-intimated, half-incomprehensible truth and beauty, the knowledge of which was the vague but permanent goal of my thought.","And wasn’t my mind also like another crib in the depths of which I felt I remained ensconced, even in order to watch what was happening outside? When I saw an external object, my awareness that I was seeing it would remain between me and it, lining it with a thin spiritual border that prevented me from ever directly touching its substance; it would volatize in some way before I could make contact with it, just as an incandescent body brought near a wet object never touches its moisture because it is always preceded by a zone of evaporation. In the sort of screen dappled with different states of mind which my consciousness would simultaneously unfold while I read, and which ranged from the aspirations hidden deepest within me to the completely exterior vision of the horizon which I had, at the bottom of the garden, before my eyes, what was first in me, innermost, the constantly moving handle that controlled the rest, was my belief in the philosophical richness and the beauty of the book I was reading, and my desire to appropriate them for myself, whatever that book might be. For, even if I had bought it in Combray, having seen it in front of Borange’s grocery, which was too far away from the house for Françoise to be able to do her shopping there as she did at Camus’s, but which was better stocked as stationer and bookshop, held in place by some strings in the mosaic of pamphlets and monthly serials that covered the two panels of its door, which was itself more mysterious, more sown with ideas than the door of a cathedral, the fact was that I had recognized it as having been mentioned to me as a remarkable work by the teacher or friend who appeared to me at that period to hold the secret of the truth and beauty half sensed, half incomprehensible, the knowledge of which was the goal, vague but permanent, of my thoughts.","And then my thoughts, did not they form a similar sort of hiding-hole, in the depths of which I felt that I could bury myself and remain invisible even when I was looking at what went on outside? When I saw any external object, my consciousness that I was seeing it would remain between me and it, enclosing it in a slender, incorporeal outline which prevented me from ever coming directly in contact with the material form; for it would volatilise itself in some way before I could touch it, just as an incandescent body which is moved towards something wet never actually touches moisture, since it is always preceded, itself, by a zone of evaporation. Upon the sort of screen, patterned with different states and impressions, which my consciousness would quietly unfold while I was reading, and which ranged from the most deeply hidden aspirations of my heart to the wholly external view of the horizon spread out before my eyes at the foot of the garden, what was from the first the most permanent and the most intimate part of me, the lever whose incessant movements controlled all the rest, was my belief in the philosophic richness and beauty of the book I was reading, and my desire to appropriate these to myself, whatever the book might be. For even if I had purchased it at Combray, having seen it outside Borange's, whose grocery lay too far from our house for Françoise to be able to deal there, as she did with Camus, but who enjoyed better custom as a stationer and bookseller; even if I had seen it, tied with string to keep it in its place in the mosaic of monthly parts and pamphlets which adorned either side of his doorway, a doorway more mysterious, more teeming with suggestion than that of a cathedral, I should have noticed and bought it there simply because I had recognised it as a book which had been well spoken of, in my hearing, by the school-master or the school-friend who, at that particular time, seemed to me to be entrusted with the secret of Truth and Beauty , things half-felt by me, half-incomprehensible , the full understanding of which was the vague but permanent object of my thoughts."

"Il revenait à ce point de vue – opposé à celui de son amour et de sa jalousie, et auquel il se plaçait quelquefois par une sorte d’équité intellectuelle et pour faire la part des diverses probabilités – d’où il essayait de juger Odette comme s’il ne l’avait pas aimée, comme si elle était pour lui une femme comme les autres, comme si la vie d’Odette n’avait pas été, dès qu’il n’était plus là, différente, tramée en cachette de lui, ourdie contre lui.","He came back to this point of view – opposed to that of his love and his jealousy, and to which he sometimes adopted himself out of a sort of intellectual fairness and to take into account the various probabilities – from which he tried to judge Odette as if he hadn't loved her, as if she were for him a woman like the others, as if Odette's life hadn't been, as soon as he was gone, different, plotted in secret of him, hatched against him.","He returned to this point of view—which was opposed to that of his love and his jealousy, and in which he placed himself sometimes through a sort of intellectual equity so as to allow for the various probabilities—from which he tried to judge Odette as if he had never loved her, as if to him she were a woman like any other, as if Odette’s life had not been, as soon as he was no longer there, different, contrived in hiding from him, plotted against him.","He returned to the other point of view—opposite to that of his love and of his jealousy, to which he resorted at times by a sort of mental equity, and in order to make allowance for different eventualities—from which he tried to form a fresh judgment of Odette, based on the supposition that he had never been in love with her, that she was to him just a woman like other women, that her life had not been (whenever he himself was not present) different, a texture woven in secret apart from him, and warped against him."

"Il en avait eu souvent la pensée. Maintenant qu’il s’était remis à son étude sur Ver Meer il aurait eu besoin de retourner au moins quelques jours à la Haye, à Dresde, à Brunswick. Il était persuadé qu’une « Toilette de Diane » qui avait été achetée par le Mauritshuis à la vente Goldschmidt comme un Nicolas Maes était en réalité de Ver Meer. Et il aurait voulu pouvoir étudier le tableau sur place pour étayer sa conviction. Mais quitter Paris pendant qu’Odette y était et même quand elle était absente – car dans des lieux nouveaux où les sensations ne sont pas amorties par l’habitude, on retrempe, on ranime une douleur – c’était pour lui un projet si cruel, qu’il ne se sentait capable d’y penser sans cesse que parce qu’il se savait résolu à ne l’exécuter jamais. Mais il arrivait qu’en dormant, l’intention du voyage renaissait en lui – sans qu’il se rappelât que ce voyage était impossible – et elle s’y réalisait. Un jour il rêva qu’il partait pour un an ; penché à la portière du wagon vers un jeune homme qui sur le quai lui disait adieu en pleurant, Swann cherchait à le convaincre de partir avec lui. Le train s’ébranlant, l’anxiété le réveilla, il se rappela qu’il ne partait pas, qu’il verrait Odette ce soir-là, le lendemain et presque chaque jour. Alors, encore tout ému de son rêve, il bénit les circonstances particulières qui le rendaient indépendant, grâce auxquelles il pouvait rester près d’Odette, et aussi réussir à ce qu’elle lui permît de la voir quelquefois ; et, récapitulant tous ces avantages : sa situation – sa fortune, dont elle avait souvent trop besoin pour ne pas reculer devant une rupture (ayant même, disait-on, une arrière-pensée de se faire épouser par lui) – cette amitié de M. de Charlus qui à vrai dire ne lui avait jamais fait obtenir grand’chose d’Odette, mais lui donnait la douceur de sentir qu’elle entendait parler de lui d’une manière flatteuse par cet ami commun pour qui elle avait une si grande estime – et jusqu’à son intelligence enfin, qu’il employait tout entière à combiner chaque jour une intrigue nouvelle qui rendît sa présence sinon agréable, du moins nécessaire à Odette – il songea à ce qu’il serait devenu si tout cela lui avait manqué, il songea que s’il avait été, comme tant d’autres, pauvre, humble, dénué, obligé d’accepter toute besogne, ou lié à des parents, à une épouse, il aurait pu être obligé de quitter Odette, que ce rêve dont l’effroi était encore si proche aurait pu être vrai, et il se dit : « On ne connaît pas son bonheur. On n’est jamais aussi malheureux qu’on croit. » Mais il compta que cette existence durait déjà depuis plusieurs années, que tout ce qu’il pouvait espérer c’est qu’elle durât toujours, qu’il sacrifierait ses travaux, ses plaisirs, ses amis, finalement toute sa vie à l’attente quotidienne d’un rendez-vous qui ne pouvait rien lui apporter d’heureux, et il se demanda s’il ne se trompait pas, si ce qui avait favorisé sa liaison et en avait empêché la rupture n’avait pas desservi sa destinée, si l’événement désirable, ce n’aurait pas été celui dont il se réjouissait tant qu’il n’eût eu lieu qu’en rêve : son départ ; il se dit qu’on ne connaît pas son malheur, qu’on n’est jamais si heureux qu’on croit.","He had often thought of it. Now that he had resumed his study of Ver Meer he would have needed to return at least a few days to The Hague, to Dresden, to Brunswick. He was convinced that a ""Toilet of Diane"" which had been bought by the Mauritshuis at the Goldschmidt sale as a Nicolas Maes was actually from Ver Meer. And he would have liked to be able to study the painting on the spot to support his conviction. But to leave Paris while Odette was there and even when she was absent – because in new places where sensations are not deadened by habit, one retempers, one revives a pain – it was for him such a cruel project. , that he felt capable of thinking about it incessantly only because he knew he was resolved never to execute it. But it happened that while sleeping, the intention of the trip would reappear in him – without his remembering that this trip was impossible – and it would come true. One day he dreamed that he was going away for a year; Leaning out of the car door toward a young man on the platform who was saying goodbye to him, crying, Swann was trying to convince him to leave with him. The train swaying, anxiety awoke him, he remembered that he was not leaving, that he would see Odette that evening, the next day, and almost every day. Then, still deeply moved by his dream, he blessed the special circumstances which made him independent, thanks to which he was able to stay close to Odette, and also succeed in getting her to allow him to see her sometimes; and, summing up all these advantages: her situation – her fortune, which she often needed too much not to shrink from a break-up (even having, it was said, an ulterior motive of getting him to marry her) – this friendship of Mrs. de Charlus who, to tell the truth, had never made her obtain much from Odette, but gave her the sweetness of feeling that she heard him spoken of in a flattering way by this mutual friend for whom she had such a great esteem – and even his intelligence, which he devoted entirely to combining every day a new plot that would make his presence if not agreeable, at least necessary to Odette – he thought of what he would have become if all that had failed, he thought that if he had been, like so many others, poor, humble, destitute, obliged to accept any task, or tied to relatives, to a wife, he might have been obliged to leave Odette, that this dream whose dread was still so close could have been true, and he said to himself: ""We don't know not have his happiness. We are never as unhappy as we think. But he reckoned that this existence had already lasted for several years, that all he could hope for was that it would last forever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his friends, finally his whole life to the daily expectation of an appointment which could bring him nothing happy, and he wondered if he was not mistaken, if what had favored his liaison and had prevented the breakup had not served his destiny , if the desirable event would not have been the one he rejoiced in so long as it had only taken place in a dream: his departure; he says to himself that one does not know one's misfortune, that one is never as happy as one thinks.","He had often thought of it. Now that he had resumed his study of Vermeer, he needed to return at least for a few days to The Hague, Dresden, Brunswick. He was convinced that a Diana with Her Companions which had been bought by the Mauritshuis at the Goldschmidt sale as a Nicolas Maes, was in reality a Vermeer.108 And he wished he could study the painting on the spot, in order to support his conviction. But to leave Paris while Odette was there, or even when she was absent—for in new places where our sensations are not dulled by habit, we retemper, we revive an old pain—was for him so cruel a plan that he was able to think about it constantly only because he knew he was resolved never to execute it. But sometimes, while he was asleep, the intention of taking the trip would revive in him—without his remembering that it was impossible—and in his sleep he would take the trip. One day he dreamed he was leaving for a year; leaning out the door of the railway car toward a young man on the platform who was saying good-bye to him, weeping, Swann tried to convince him to leave with him. The train began to move, his anxiety woke him, he remembered that he was not leaving, that he would see Odette that evening, the next day, and almost every day after. Then, still shaken by his dream, he blessed the particular circumstances that had made him independent, because of which he could remain near Odette, and also succeed in getting her to allow him to see her now and then; and, recapitulating all these advantages—his position; his fortune, from which she was too often in need of assistance not to shrink from contemplating a definite break with him (having even, people said, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry her); his friendship with M. de Charlus, which in truth had never helped him obtain much from Odette, but gave him the comfort of feeling that she heard flattering things about him from this mutual friend for whom she had such great esteem; and lastly even his intelligence, which he employed entirely in contriving a new intrigue every day that would make his presence, if not agreeable, at least necessary to Odette—he thought about what would have become of him if he had not had all this, he thought that if, like so many other men, he had been poor, humble, wretched, obliged to accept any sort of work, or tied to relatives, to a wife, he might have been forced to leave Odette, that that dream, the terror of which was still so close to him, might have been true, and he said to himself: “You don’t know it when you’re happy. You’re never as unhappy as you think. ”109 But he calculated that this existence had already lasted for several years, that all he could hope for now was that it would last forever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his friends, finally his whole life to the daily expectation of a meeting that could bring him no happiness, and he wondered if he was not deceiving himself, if the circumstances that had favored his love affair and kept it from ending had not been bad for the course of his life, if the desirable outcome would not in fact have been the one which, to his delight, had taken place only in a dream: for him to have gone away; he told himself that you don’t know it when you’re unhappy, that you are never as happy as you think.","He had often thought of going. Now that he was once again at work upon his essay on Vermeer, he wanted to return, for a few days at least, to The Hague, to Dresden, to Brunswick. He was certain that a 'Toilet of Diana' which had been acquired by the Mauritshuis at the Goldschmidt sale as a Nicholas Maes was in reality a Vermeer. And he would have liked to be able to examine the picture on the spot, so as to strengthen his conviction. But to leave Paris while Odette was there, and even when she was not there—for in strange places where our sensations have not been numbed by habit, we refresh, we revive an old pain—was for him so cruel a project that he felt himself to be capable of entertaining it incessantly in his mind only because he knew himself to be resolute in his determination never to put it into effect. But it would happen that, while he was asleep, the intention to travel would reawaken in him (without his remembering that this particular tour was impossible) and would be realised. One night he dreamed that he was going away for a year; leaning from the window of the train towards a young man on the platform who wept as he bade him farewell, he was seeking to persuade this young man to come away also. The train began to move; he awoke in alarm, and remembered that he was not going away, that he would see Odette that evening, and next day and almost every day. And then, being still deeply moved by his dream, he would thank heaven for those special circumstances which made him independent, thanks to which he could remain in Odette's vicinity, and could even succeed in making her allow him to see her sometimes; and, counting over the list of his advantages: his social position—his fortune, from which she stood too often in need of assistance not to shrink from the prospect of a definite rupture (having even, so people said, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry her)—his friendship with M. de Charlus, which, it must be confessed, had never won him any very great favour from Odette, but which gave him the pleasant feeling that she was always hearing complimentary things said about him by this common friend for whom she had so great an esteem—and even his own intelligence, the whole of which he employed in weaving, every day, a fresh plot which would make his presence, if not agreeable, at any rate necessary to Odette—he thought of what might have happened to him if all these advantages had been lacking, he thought that, if he had been, like so many other men, poor and humble, without resources, forced to undertake any task that might be offered to him, or tied down by parents or by a wife, he might have been obliged to part from Odette, that that dream, the terror of which was still so recent, might well have been true; and he said to himself: ""People don't know when they are happy. They're never so unhappy as they think they are. "" But he reflected that this existence had lasted already for several years, that all that he could now hope for was that it should last for ever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his friends, in fact the whole of his life to the daily expectation of a meeting which, when it occurred, would bring him no happiness; and he asked himself whether he was not mistaken, whether the circumstances that had favoured their relations and had prevented a final rupture had not done a disservice to his career, whether the outcome to be desired was not that as to which he rejoiced that it happened only in dreams—his own departure; and he said to himself that people did not know when they were unhappy, that they were never so happy as they supposed."
"Un jour que des réflexions de ce genre le ramenaient encore au souvenir du temps où on lui avait parlé d’Odette comme d’une femme entretenue, et où une fois de plus il s’amusait à opposer cette personnification étrange : la femme entretenue – chatoyant amalgame d’éléments inconnus et diaboliques, serti, comme une apparition de Gustave Moreau, de fleurs vénéneuses entrelacées à des joyaux précieux – et cette Odette sur le visage de qui il avait vu passer les mêmes sentiments de pitié pour un malheureux, de révolte contre une injustice, de gratitude pour un bienfait, qu’il avait vu éprouver autrefois par sa propre mère, par ses amis, cette Odette dont les propos avaient si souvent trait aux choses qu’il connaissait le mieux lui-même, à ses collections, à sa chambre, à son vieux domestique, au banquier chez qui il avait ses titres, il se trouva que cette dernière image du banquier lui rappela qu’il aurait à y prendre de l’argent. En effet, si ce mois-ci il venait moins largement à l’aide d’Odette dans ses difficultés matérielles qu’il n’avait fait le mois dernier où il lui avait donné cinq mille francs, et s’il ne lui offrait pas une rivière de diamants qu’elle désirait, il ne renouvellerait pas en elle cette admiration qu’elle avait pour sa générosité, cette reconnaissance, qui le rendaient si heureux, et même il risquerait de lui faire croire que son amour pour elle, comme elle en verrait les manifestations devenir moins grandes, avait diminué. Alors, tout d’un coup, il se demanda si cela, ce n’était pas précisément l’« entretenir » (comme si, en effet, cette notion d’entretenir pouvait être extraite d’éléments non pas mystérieux ni pervers, mais appartenant au fond quotidien et privé de sa vie, tels que ce billet de mille francs, domestique et familier, déchiré et recollé, que son valet de chambre, après lui avoir payé les comptes du mois et le terme, avait serré dans le tiroir du vieux bureau où Swann l’avait repris pour l’envoyer avec quatre autres à Odette) et si on ne pouvait pas appliquer à Odette, depuis qu’il la connaissait (car il ne soupçonna pas un instant qu’elle eût jamais pu recevoir d’argent de personne avant lui), ce mot qu’il avait cru si inconciliable avec elle, de « femme entretenue ». Il ne put approfondir cette idée, car un accès d’une paresse d’esprit, qui était chez lui congénitale, intermittente et providentielle, vint à ce moment éteindre toute lumière dans son intelligence, aussi brusquement que, plus tard, quand on eut installé partout l’éclairage électrique, on put couper l’électricité dans une maison. Sa pensée tâtonna un instant dans l’obscurité, il retira ses lunettes, en essuya les verres, se passa la main sur les yeux, et ne revit la lumière que quand il se retrouva en présence d’une idée toute différente, à savoir qu’il faudrait tâcher d’envoyer le mois prochain six ou sept mille francs à Odette au lieu de cinq, à cause de la surprise et de la joie que cela lui causerait.","One day when reflections of this kind still brought him back to the memory of the time when he had been spoken to of Odette as a kept woman, and when once again he amused himself by contrasting this strange personification: the kept woman – shimmering amalgamation of unknown and diabolical elements, set, like an apparition of Gustave Moreau, with poisonous flowers intertwined with precious jewels – and this Odette on whose face he had seen the same feelings of pity for an unfortunate person, of revolt against an injustice, of gratitude for a benefit, which he had seen experienced in the past by his own mother, by his friends, this Odette whose remarks so often related to the things he knew best himself, to his collections , to his room, to his old servant, to the banker with whom he had his titles, it happened that this last image of the banker reminded him that he would have to take money there. In fact, if this month he came to the aid of Odette less extensively in her material difficulties than he had done last month when he had given her five thousand francs, and if he did not offer her a river of diamonds that she desired, he would not renew in her that admiration she had for his generosity, that gratitude, which made him so happy, and he would even risk making her believe that his love for her, like her would see its manifestations become smaller, had diminished. Then, all of a sudden, he wondered if that was not precisely ""maintaining"" it (as if, indeed, this notion of maintaining could be extracted from elements that were not mysterious or perverse, but belonging to the daily and private fund of his life, such as this thousand-franc note, domestic and familiar, torn and glued, which his valet, after paying him the bills for the month and the term, had kept in the drawer of the old office where Swann had taken him back to send him with four others to Odette) and if one could not apply to Odette, since he knew her (because he did not suspect for a moment that she had ever been able to receive money from anyone before him), that word he had thought so irreconcilable with her, 'kept woman'. He could not pursue this idea, for an attack of laziness of mind, which was congenital, intermittent and providential with him, came at that moment to extinguish all light in his intelligence, as abruptly as, later, when one had installed electric lighting everywhere, it was possible to cut off the electricity in a house. His thoughts groped for a moment in the darkness, he took off his glasses, wiped the glasses, passed his hand over his eyes, and did not see the light again until he found himself in the presence of an entirely different idea, namely that We should try to send six or seven thousand francs to Odette next month instead of five, because of the surprise and joy it would cause her.","One day when reflections of this kind were leading him back once again to the memory of the time when people had described Odette to him as a kept woman, and when he was amusing himself yet again by contrasting that strange personification, the kept woman—an iridescent amalgam of unfamiliar and diabolical elements, set, like some apparition by Gustave Moreau,66 among venomous flowers interwoven with precious jewels—with the Odette on whose face he had seen the same feelings of pity for a sufferer, revolt against an injustice, gratitude for a favor, that he had seen in earlier days on his own mother’s face and on the faces of his friends, the Odette whose conversation had so often turned on the things he knew best himself, on his collections, his room, his old servant, the banker who looked after his securities, it happened that this last image of the banker reminded him that he would have to call on him soon to draw some money. In fact, if this month he was less liberal when helping Odette out of her material difficulties than he had been the month before when he had given her five thousand francs, and if he did not present her with a diamond rivière that she wanted, he would not reawaken her admiration for his generosity, her gratitude, which made him so happy, and he would even risk making her think that his love for her, as she saw its manifestations become less abundant, had diminished. Then, suddenly, he wondered if this was not precisely what was meant by “keeping” her (as if, in fact, this notion of keeping could be derived from elements not at all mysterious or perverse but belonging to the intimate substance of his daily life, like that thousand-franc bill, domestic and familiar, torn and reglued, which his valet, after having paid the month’s accounts and the quarter’s rent for him, had locked in the drawer of the old desk from which Swann had taken it out again to send it with four others to Odette) and if one could not apply to Odette, starting from when he had come to know her (because he did not for a moment suspect that she could ever have received money from anyone before him), those words which he had believed so irreconcilable with her—“kept woman.” He could not study this idea in greater depth, because an attack of that mental laziness which in him was congenital, intermittent, and providential, happened at that moment to extinguish all light in his intelligence, as abruptly as, later, when electric lighting had been installed everywhere, one could cut off the electricity in a house. His mind groped for a moment in the darkness, he took off his glasses, wiped the lenses, passed his hand over his eyes, and saw the light again only when he found himself in the presence of an entirely different idea, namely that he ought to try to send six or seven thousand francs to Odette next month instead of five, because of the surprise and pleasure it would give her.","One day, when reflections of this order had brought him once again to the memory of the time when some one had spoken to him of Odette as of a 'kept' woman, and when, once again, he had amused himself with contrasting that strange personification, the 'kept' woman—an iridescent mixture of unknown and demoniacal qualities, embroidered, as in some fantasy of Gustave Moreau, with poison-dripping flowers, interwoven with precious jewels—with that Odette upon whose face he had watched the passage of the same expressions of pity for a sufferer, resentment of an act of injustice, gratitude for an act of kindness, which he had seen, in earlier days, on his own mother's face, and on the faces of friends; that Odette, whose conversation had so frequently turned on the things that he himself knew better than anyone, his collections, his room, his old servant, his banker, who kept all his title-deeds and bonds;—the thought of the banker reminded him that he must call on him shortly, to draw some money. And indeed, if, during the current month, he were to come less liberally to the aid of Odette in her financial difficulties than in the month before, when he had given her five thousand francs, if he refrained from offering her a diamond necklace for which she longed, he would be allowing her admiration for his generosity to decline, that gratitude which had made him so happy, and would even be running the risk of her imagining that his love for her (as she saw its visible manifestations grow fewer) had itself diminished. And then, suddenly, he asked himself whether that was not precisely what was implied by 'keeping' a woman (as if, in fact, that idea of 'keeping' could be derived from elements not at all mysterious nor perverse, but belonging to the intimate routine of his daily life, such as that thousand-franc note, a familiar and domestic object, torn in places and mended with gummed paper, which his valet, after paying the household accounts and the rent, had locked up hi a drawer in the old writing-desk whence he had extracted it to send it, with four others, to Odette) and whether it was not possible to apply to Odette, since he had known her (for he never imagined for a moment that she could ever have taken a penny from anyone else, before), that title, which he had believed so wholly inapplicable to her, of 'kept' woman. He could not explore the idea further, for a sudden access of that mental lethargy which was, with him, congenital, intermittent and providential, happened, at that moment, to extinguish every particle of light in his brain, as instantaneously as, at a later period, when electric lighting had been everywhere installed, it became possible, merely by fingering a switch, to cut off all the supply of light from a house. His mind fumbled, for a moment, in the darkness, he took off his spectacles, wiped the glasses, passed his hands over his eyes, but saw no light until he found himself face to face with a wholly different idea, the realisation that he must endeavour, in the coming month, to send Odette six or seven thousand-franc notes instead of five, simply as a surprise for her and to give her pleasure."
"Ils ne m’apparaissaient plus que comme les créations purement subjectives, impuissantes, illusoires, de mon tempérament.

"Or ce garçon, qui passait et avec raison pour si mauvais sujet, était tellement rempli de l’âme qui avait décoré Saint-André-des-Champs et notamment des sentiments de respect que Françoise trouvait dus aux « pauvres malades », à « sa pauvre maîtresse », qu’il avait pour soulever la tête de ma tante sur son oreiller la mine naïve et zélée des petits anges des bas-reliefs, s’empressant, un cierge à la main, autour de la Vierge défaillante, comme si les visages de pierre sculptée, grisâtres et nus, ainsi que sont les bois en hiver, n’étaient qu’un ensommeillement, qu’une réserve, prête à refleurir dans la vie en innombrables visages populaires, révérends et futés comme celui de Théodore, enluminés de la rougeur d’une pomme mûre. Non plus appliquée à la pierre comme ces petits anges, mais détachée du porche, d’une stature plus qu’humaine, debout sur un socle comme sur un tabouret qui lui évitât de poser ses pieds sur le sol humide, une sainte avait les joues pleines, le sein ferme et qui gonflait la draperie comme une grappe mûre dans un sac de crin, le front étroit, le nez court et mutin, les prunelles enfoncées, l’air valide, insensible et courageux des paysannes de la contrée. Cette ressemblance, qui insinuait dans la statue une douceur que je n’y avais pas cherchée, était souvent certifiée par quelque fille des champs, venue comme nous se mettre à couvert, et dont la présence, pareille à celle de ces feuillages pariétaires qui ont poussé à côté des feuillages sculptés, semblait destinée à permettre, par une confrontation avec la nature, de juger de la vérité de l’œuvre d’art. Devant nous, dans le lointain, terre promise ou maudite, Roussainville, dans les murs duquel je n’ai jamais pénétré, Roussainville, tantôt, quand la pluie avait déjà cessé pour nous, continuait à être châtié comme un village de la Bible par toutes les lances de l’orage qui flagellaient obliquement les demeures de ses habitants, ou bien était déjà pardonné par Dieu le Père qui faisait descendre vers lui, inégalement longues, comme les rayons d’un ostensoir d’autel, les tiges d’or effrangées de son soleil reparu.","Now this boy, who passed and with good reason for being such a bad subject, was so filled with the soul that had decorated Saint-André-des-Champs and in particular with the feelings of respect that Françoise found due to the ""poor patients"", to ""her poor mistress"", that he had to raise my aunt's head on her pillow with the naive and zealous expression of the little angels in the bas-reliefs, hastening, a candle in their hand, around the fainting Virgin, as if the faces of sculpted stone, greyish and bare, as the woods are in winter, were only a drowsiness, only a reserve, ready to bloom again in life in innumerable popular faces, reverend and shrewd like that of Theodore, illuminated the redness of a ripe apple. No longer applied to the stone like these little angels, but detached from the porch, of a more than human stature, standing on a pedestal as on a stool which prevented her from putting her feet on the damp ground, a saint had the cheeks full, the breast firm and which swelled the drapery like a ripe bunch in a sack of horsehair, the narrow forehead, the short and mischievous nose, the sunken pupils, the healthy, insensitive and courageous air of the peasant women of the region. This resemblance, which insinuated into the statue a sweetness that I had not sought there, was often certified by some girl from the fields, who had come like us to take cover, and whose presence, like that of those parietary leaves which have pushed next to the carved foliage, seemed intended to allow, by a confrontation with nature, to judge the truth of the work of art. In front of us, in the distance, promised or cursed land, Roussainville, whose walls I never penetrated, Roussainville, earlier, when the rain had already stopped for us, continued to be chastised like a village in the Bible by all the spears of the storm which obliquely scourged the dwellings of its inhabitants, or else was already forgiven by God the Father who sent down to him, unequally long, like the rays of an altar monstrance, the frayed golden rods of its reappearing sun.","Now this boy, who was taken, and rightly, for such a ne’er-do-well, was so filled with the same spirit that had decorated Saint-André-des-Champs and especially with the feelings of respect that Françoise believed were owed to “poor sick folk,” to “her poor mistress,” that as he raised my aunt’s head on her pillow he had the same naive and zealous expression as the little angels in the bas-reliefs, crowding around the fainting Virgin with tapers in their hands, as if the faces of sculpted stone, bare and gray as the woods in winter, were only a deep sleep, a reserve, about to blossom into life again in numberless common faces, reverent and crafty like Théodore’s, illuminated with the redness of a ripe apple. No longer affixed to the stone like those little angels, but detached from the porch, of larger than human size, standing on a pedestal as though on a stool that spared her putting her feet on the damp ground, one saint had the full cheeks, the firm breast swelling the folds of the cloth like a cluster of ripe grapes in a horsehair sack, the narrow forehead, the short and saucy nose, the deep-set eyes, the able-bodied, impassive, and courageous demeanor of the countrywomen of the region. This resemblance, which insinuated into the statue a sweetness I had not looked for in it, was often authenticated by some girl from the fields, who, like us, had come to take cover, and whose presence, like the presence of the leaves of a climbing plant that has grown up next to some sculpted leaves, seemed intended to allow us, by confronting it with nature, to judge the truthfulness of the work of art. Before us in the distance, a promised land or an accursed one, Roussainville, was now, when the rain had already stopped for us, either continuing to be chastised like the village in the Bible by all the slanting spears of the storm, which scourged the dwellings of its inhabitants, or else had already been pardoned by God the Father, who caused to descend upon it, unequal in length, like the rays of an altar monstrance, the frayed golden shafts of his reappearing sun.","And this lad, who was regarded, and quite rightly, in the town as a 'bad character,' was so abounding in that spirit which had served to decorate the porch of Saint-André-des-Champs, and particularly in the feelings of respect due, in Franchise's eyes, to all 'poor invalids,' and, above all, to her own 'poor mistress,' that he had, when he bent down to raise my aunt's head from her pillow, the same air of préraphaélite simplicity and zeal which the little angels in the has-reliefs wear, who throng, with tapers in their hands, about the deathbed of Our Lady, as though those carved faces of stone, naked and grey like trees in winter, were, like them, asleep only, storing up life and waiting to flower again in countless plebeian faces, reverend and cunning as the face of Théodore, and glowing with the ruddy brilliance of ripe apples. There, too, not fastened to the wall like the little angels, but detached from the porch, of more than human stature, erect upon her pedestal as upon a footstool, which had been placed there to save her feet from contact with the wet ground, stood a saint with the full cheeks, the firm breasts which swelled out inside her draperies like a cluster of ripe grapes inside a bag, the narrow forehead, short and stubborn nose, deep-set eyes, and strong, thick-skinned, courageous expression of the country-women of those parts. This similarity, which imparted to the statue itself a kindliness that I had not looked to find in it, was corroborated often by the arrival of some girl from the fields, come, like ourselves, for shelter beneath the porch, whose presence there—as when the leaves of a climbing plant have grown up beside leaves carved in stone—seemed intended by fate to allow us, by confronting it with its type in nature, to form a critical estimate of the truth of the work of art. Before our eyes, in the distance, a promised or an accursed land, Roussainville, within whose walls I had never penetrated, Roussainville was now, when the rain had ceased for us, still being chastised, like a village in the Old Testament, by all the innumerable spears and arrows of the storm, which beat down obliquely upon the dwellings of its inhabitants, or else had already received the forgiveness of the Almighty, Who had restored to it the light of His sun, which fell upon it in rays of uneven length, like the rays of a monstrance upon an altar."

"Parmi l’obscurité de toutes les fenêtres éteintes depuis longtemps dans la rue, il en vit une seule d’où débordait – entre les volets qui en pressaient la pulpe mystérieuse et dorée – la lumière qui remplissait la chambre et qui, tant d’autres soirs, du plus loin qu’il l’apercevait, en arrivant dans la rue, le réjouissait et lui annonçait : « elle est là qui t’attend » et qui maintenant, le torturait en lui disant : « elle est là avec celui qu’elle attendait ». Il voulait savoir qui ; il se glissa le long du mur jusqu’à la fenêtre, mais entre les lames obliques des volets il ne pouvait rien voir ; il entendait seulement dans le silence de la nuit le murmure d’une conversation. Certes, il souffrait de voir cette lumière dans l’atmosphère d’or de laquelle se mouvait derrière le châssis le couple invisible et détesté, d’entendre ce murmure qui révélait la présence de celui qui était venu après son départ, la fausseté d’Odette, le bonheur qu’elle était en train de goûter avec lui.","Among the darkness of all the windows that had been extinguished for a long time in the street, he saw only one from which overflowed – between the shutters which pressed its mysterious golden pulp – the light which filled the room and which, so many others evenings, as far as he could see her, arriving in the street, cheered him up and announced to him: ""she's there waiting for you"" and who now tortured him by saying: ""she's there with the one you 'she waited "". He wanted to know who; he slipped along the wall to the window, but between the slanting slats of the shutters he could see nothing; he only heard in the silence of the night the murmur of a conversation. Certainly, he suffered to see this light in the golden atmosphere of which moved behind the frame the invisible and hated couple, to hear this murmur which revealed the presence of the one who had come after his departure, the falsity of Odette, the happiness she was enjoying with him.","Amid the blackness of all the windows in the street in which the lights had long since been put out, he saw just one from which there spilled out—between shutters which pressed its mysterious golden pulp—the light which filled the bedroom and which, on so many other evenings, as soon as he saw it when he came into the street, lifted his spirits and announced to him: “She’s there waiting for you” and which now tortured him by saying: “She’s there with the man she was waiting for.” He wanted to know who it was; he slipped along the wall as far as the window, but between the oblique slats of the shutters he could see nothing; all he heard in the silence of the night was the murmur of conversation.

"" He must know who; he tiptoed along by the wall until he reached the window, but between the slanting bars of the shutters he could see nothing; he could hear, only, in the silence of the night, the murmur of conversation.

"Elle le pria d’éteindre la lumière avant de s’en aller, il referma lui-même les rideaux du lit et partit. Mais quand il fut rentré chez lui, l’idée lui vint brusquement que peut-être Odette attendait quelqu’un ce soir, qu’elle avait seulement simulé la fatigue et qu’elle ne lui avait demandé d’éteindre que pour qu’il crût qu’elle allait s’endormir, qu’aussitôt qu’il avait été parti, elle l’avait rallumée, et fait rentrer celui qui devait passer la nuit auprès d’elle. Il regarda l’heure. Il y avait à peu près une heure et demie qu’il l’avait quittée, il ressortit, prit un fiacre et se fit arrêter tout près de chez elle, dans une petite rue perpendiculaire à celle sur laquelle donnait derrière son hôtel et où il allait quelquefois frapper à la fenêtre de sa chambre à coucher pour qu’elle vînt lui ouvrir ; il descendit de voiture, tout était désert et noir dans ce quartier, il n’eut que quelques pas à faire à pied et déboucha presque devant chez elle.","She asked him to turn off the light before leaving, he closed the bed curtains himself and left.

He looked at the time. He had left her about an hour and a half ago, he went out again, took a cab and had himself stopped very close to her house, in a small street perpendicular to the one on which his hotel opened behind and where he would sometimes knock on her bedroom window to get her to open the door for him; he got out of the car, everything was deserted and dark in this neighborhood, he only had to walk a few steps and came out almost in front of her house.","She asked him to put out the light before he went, he himself closed the curtains of the bed and left.

He looked at the time. It was about an hour and a half since he had left her, he went back out, took a hackney carriage, and stopped it very close to where she lived, in a little street at right angles to the one which lay behind her house and into which he sometimes went to knock at her bedroom window so that she would come and open the door for him; he got out of the carriage, the neighborhood was dark and deserted, he had only to walk a few steps, and he came out almost opposite her house.","She begged him to put out the light before he went; he drew the curtains close round her bed and left her.

"Mais depuis plus d’une année que, lui révélant à lui-même bien des richesses de son âme, l’amour de la musique était pour quelque temps au moins né en lui, Swann tenait les motifs musicaux pour de véritables idées, d’un autre monde, d’un autre ordre, idées voilées de ténèbres, inconnues, impénétrables à l’intelligence, mais qui n’en sont pas moins parfaitement distinctes les unes des autres, inégales entre elles de valeur et de signification. Quand après la soirée Verdurin, se faisant rejouer la petite phrase, il avait cherché à démêler comment à la façon d’un parfum, d’une caresse, elle le circonvenait, elle l’enveloppait, il s’était rendu compte que c’était au faible écart entre les cinq notes qui la composaient et au rappel constant de deux d’entre elles qu’était due cette impression de douceur rétractée et frileuse ; mais en réalité il savait qu’il raisonnait ainsi non sur la phrase elle-même mais sur de simples valeurs, substituées pour la commodité de son intelligence à la mystérieuse entité qu’il avait perçue, avant de connaître les Verdurin, à cette soirée où il avait entendu pour la première fois la sonate. Il savait que le souvenir même du piano faussait encore le plan dans lequel il voyait les choses de la musique, que le champ ouvert au musicien n’est pas un clavier mesquin de sept notes, mais un clavier incommensurable, encore presque tout entier inconnu, où seulement çà et là, séparées par d’épaisses ténèbres inexplorées, quelques-unes des millions de touches de tendresse, de passion, de courage, de sérénité, qui le composent, chacune aussi différente des autres qu’un univers d’un autre univers, ont été découvertes par quelques grands artistes qui nous rendent le service, en éveillant en nous le correspondant du thème qu’ils ont trouvé, de nous montrer quelle richesse, quelle variété, cache à notre insu cette grande nuit impénétrée et décourageante de notre âme que nous prenons pour du vide et pour du néant. Vinteuil avait été l’un de ces musiciens. En sa petite phrase, quoiqu’elle présentât à la raison une surface obscure, on sentait un contenu si consistant, si explicite, auquel elle donnait une force si nouvelle, si originale, que ceux qui l’avaient entendue la conservaient en eux de plain-pied avec les idées de l’intelligence. Swann s’y reportait comme à une conception de l’amour et du bonheur dont immédiatement il savait aussi bien en quoi elle était particulière, qu’il le savait pour la « Princesse de Clèves », ou pour « René », quand leur nom se présentait à sa mémoire. Même quand il ne pensait pas à la petite phrase, elle existait latente dans son esprit au même titre que certaines autres notions sans équivalent, comme les notions de la lumière, du son, du relief, de la volupté physique, qui sont les riches possessions dont se diversifie et se pare notre domaine intérieur. Peut-être les perdrons-nous, peut-être s’effaceront-elles, si nous retournons au néant. Mais tant que nous vivons, nous ne pouvons pas plus faire que nous ne les ayons connues que nous ne le pouvons pour quelque objet réel, que nous ne pouvons par exemple douter de la lumière de la lampe qu’on allume devant les objets métamorphosés de notre chambre d’où s’est échappé jusqu’au souvenir de l’obscurité. Par là, la phrase de Vinteuil avait, comme tel thème de Tristan par exemple, qui nous représente aussi une certaine acquisition sentimentale, épousé notre condition mortelle, pris quelque chose d’humain qui était assez touchant. Son sort était lié à l’avenir, à la réalité de notre âme dont elle était un des ornements les plus particuliers, les mieux différenciés. Peut-être est-ce le néant qui est le vrai et tout notre rêve est-il inexistant, mais alors nous sentons qu’il faudra que ces phrases musicales, ces notions qui existent par rapport à lui, ne soient rien non plus. Nous périrons, mais nous avons pour otages ces captives divines qui suivront notre chance. Et la mort avec elle a quelque chose de moins amer, de moins inglorieux, peut-être de moins probable.","But for more than a year since, revealing to him many of the riches of his soul, the love of music had been born in him for some time at least, Swann considered musical motifs to be true ideas, to another world, of another order, ideas veiled in darkness, unknown, impenetrable to the intellect, but which are none the less perfectly distinct from each other, unequal to each other in value and meaning. When, after the Verdurin evening, having the little phrase replayed to himself, he had tried to unravel how, like a perfume, a caress, it surrounded him, she enveloped him, he realized that it was was due to the slight gap between the five notes that made it up and the constant reminder of two of them that this impression of retracted and chilly sweetness was due; but in reality he knew that he was thus reasoning not on the sentence itself but on simple values, substituted for the convenience of his intelligence for the mysterious entity which he had perceived, before meeting the Verdurins, at that evening when he had heard the sonata for the first time. He knew that the very memory of the piano still falsified the plane in which he saw musical things, that the field open to the musician was not a mean seven-note keyboard, but an immeasurable keyboard, still almost entirely unknown, where only here and there, separated by thick unexplored darkness, a few of the millions of touches of tenderness, passion, courage, serenity, which compose it, each as different from the others as one universe from another universe, have been discovered by some great artists who render us a service, by awakening in us the correspondent of the theme they have found, to show us what richness, what variety, hides without our knowledge this great impenetrable and discouraging night of our soul that we take for emptiness and nothingness. Vinteuil had been one of these musicians. In her little phrase, although it presented an obscure surface to reason, one felt a content so consistent, so explicit, to which she gave such a new, so original force, that those who had heard it kept it within themselves. -foot with the ideas of intelligence. Swann referred to it as to a conception of love and happiness which immediately he knew as well in what it was special, as he knew for the ""Princess of Cleves"", or for ""René"", when their name stood in his memory. Even when he was not thinking of the little phrase, it existed latent in his mind just like certain other unequaled notions, such as the notions of light, sound, relief, physical voluptuousness, which are the rich possessions with which our inner domain is diversified and adorned. Perhaps we will lose them, perhaps they will fade away, if we return to nothingness. But as long as we live, we can no more do that we have known them than we can for any real object, that we cannot doubt, for example, the light of the lamp that is lit before the metamorphosed objects of our room from which escaped even the memory of darkness. In this way, Vinteuil's phrase had, like a theme from Tristan for example, which also represents a certain sentimental acquisition for us, embraced our mortal condition, took on something human that was quite touching. Its fate was linked to the future, to the reality of our soul, of which it was one of the most particular, best differentiated ornaments. Perhaps it is nothingness that is true and our whole dream is non-existent, but then we feel that these musical phrases, these notions that exist in relation to it, will have to be nothing either. We will perish, but we have as hostages these divine captives who will follow our luck. And death with her has something less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps less probable.","But ever since, more than a year ago now, the love of music had, for a time at least, been born in him, revealing to him many of the riches of his own soul, Swann had regarded musical motifs as actual ideas, of another world, of another order, ideas veiled in shadows, unknown, impenetrable to the intelligence, but not for all that less perfectly distinct from one another, unequal among themselves in value and significance. When, after the Verdurin evening, he had had the little phrase played over for him, and had sought to disentangle how it was that, like a perfume, like a caress, it encircled him, enveloped him, he had realized that it was to the closeness of the intervals between the five notes that composed it, and to the constant repetition of two of them, that was due this impression of a frigid and withdrawn sweetness; but in reality he knew that he was reasoning this way not about the phrase itself but about simple values substituted, for the convenience of his intelligence, for the mysterious entity he had perceived, before knowing the Verdurins, at that party where he had first heard the sonata played. He knew that even the memory of the piano falsified still further the perspective in which he saw the elements of the music, that the field open to the musician is not a miserable scale of seven notes, but an immeasurable keyboard still almost entirely unknown on which, here and there only, separated by shadows thick and unexplored, a few of the millions of keys of tenderness, of passion, of courage, of serenity which compose it, each as different from the others as one universe from another universe, have been found by a few great artists who do us the service, by awakening in us something corresponding to the theme they have discovered, of showing us what richness, what variety, is hidden unbeknownst to us within that great unpenetrated and disheartening darkness of our soul which we take for emptiness and nothingness. Vinteuil had been one of those musicians. In his little phrase, although it might present an obscure surface to one’s intelligence, one sensed a content so solid, so explicit, to which it gave a force so new, so original, that those who had heard it preserved it within themselves on the same plane as the ideas of the intelligence. Swann referred back to it as to a conception of love and happiness whose distinctive character he recognized at once, as he would that of La Princesse de Clèves or of René,106 when their titles returned to his memory. Even when he was not thinking of the little phrase, it existed latent in his mind in the same way as certain other notions without equivalents, like the notion of light, of sound, of perspective, of physical pleasure, which are the rich possessions that diversify and ornament the realms of our inner life. Perhaps we will lose them, perhaps they will fade away, if we return to nothingness. But as long as we are alive, we can no more eliminate our experience of them than we can our experience of some real object, than we can for example doubt the light of the lamp illuminating the metamorphosed objects in our room whence even the memory of darkness has vanished. In this way Vinteuil’s phrase had, like some theme from Tristan, for example, which also represents to us a certain emotional acquisition, espoused our mortal condition, taken on a human quality that was rather touching. Its destiny was linked to the future, to the reality of our soul, of which it was one of the most distinctive, the best differentiated ornaments. Maybe it is the nothingness that is real and our entire dream is nonexistent, but in that case we feel that these phrases of music, and these notions that exist in relation to our dream, must also be nothing. We will perish, but we have for hostages these divine captives who will follow us and share our fate. And death in their company is less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps less probable.","But ever since, more than a year before, discovering to him many of the riches of his own soul, the love of music had been born, and for a time at least had dwelt in him, Swann had regarded musical motifs as actual ideas, of another world, of another order, ideas veiled in shadows, unknown, impenetrable by the human mind, which none the less were perfectly distinct one from another, unequal among themselves in value and in significance. When, after that first evening at the Verdurins', he had had the little phrase played over to him again, and had sought to disentangle from his confused impressions how it was that, like a perfume or a caress, it swept over and enveloped him, he had observed that it was to the closeness of the intervals between the five notes which composed it and to the constant repetition of two of them that was due that impression of a frigid, a contracted sweetness; but in reality he knew that he was basing this conclusion not upon the phrase itself, but merely upon certain equivalents, substituted (for his mind's convenience) for the mysterious entity of which he had become aware, before ever he knew the Verdurins, at that earlier party, when for the first time he had heard the sonata played. He knew that his memory of the piano falsified still further the perspective in which he saw the music, that the field open to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes, but an immeasurable keyboard (still, almost all of it, unknown), on which, here and there only, separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored tracts, some few among the millions of keys, keys of tenderness, of passion, of courage, of serenity, which compose it, each one differing from all the rest as one universe differs from another, have been discovered by certain great artists who do us the service, when they awaken in us the emotion corresponding to the theme which they have found, of shewing us what richness, what variety lies hidden, unknown to us, in that great black impenetrable night, discouraging exploration, of our soul, which we have been content to regard as valueless and waste and void. Vinteuil had been one of those musicians. In his little phrase, albeit it presented to the mind's eye a clouded surface, there was contained, one felt, a matter so consistent, so explicit, to which the phrase gave so new, so original a force, that those who had once heard it preserved the memory of it in the treasure-chamber of their minds. Swann would repair to it as to a conception of love and happiness, of which at once he knew as well in what respects it was peculiar as he would know of the Princesse de Clèves, or of René, should either of those titles occur to him. Even when he was not thinking of the little phrase, it existed, latent, in his mind, in the same way as certain other conceptions without material equivalent, such as our notions of light, of sound, of perspective, of bodily desire, the rich possessions wherewith our inner temple is diversified and adorned. Perhaps we shall lose them, perhaps they will be obliterated, if we return to nothing in the dust. But so long as we are alive, we can no more bring ourselves to a state in which we shall not have known them than we can with regard to any material object, than we can, for example, doubt the luminosity of a lamp that has just been lighted, in view of the changed aspect of everything in the room, from which has vanished even the memory of the darkness. In that way Vinteuil's phrase, like some theme, say, in Tristan, which represents to us also a certain acquisition of sentiment, has espoused our mortal state, had endued a vesture of humanity that was affecting enough. Its destiny was linked, for the future, with that of the human soul, of which it was one of the special, the most distinctive ornaments. Perhaps it is not-being that is the true state, and all our dream of life is without existence; but, if so, we feel that it must be that these phrases of music, these conceptions which exist in relation to our dream, are nothing either. We shall perish, but we have for our hostages these divine captives who shall follow and share our fate. And death in their company is something less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps even less certain."

"Blanche de Castille ? », puis sans bouger la tête lança furtivement de droite et de gauche des regards incertains et souriants. Tandis que Swann, par l’effort douloureux et vain qu’il fit pour sourire, témoigna qu’il jugeait ce calembour stupide, Forcheville avait montré à la fois qu’il en goûtait la finesse et qu’il savait vivre, en contenant dans de justes limites une gaieté dont la franchise avait charmé MmeVerdurin.","White of Castile? then, without moving his head, furtively cast uncertain, smiling glances from right to left.

"Nous nous asseyions entre les iris au bord de l’eau. Dans le ciel férié flânait longuement un nuage oisif. Par moments, oppressée par l’ennui, une carpe se dressait hors de l’eau dans une aspiration anxieuse. C’était l’heure du goûter. Avant de repartir nous restions longtemps à manger des fruits, du pain et du chocolat, sur l’herbe où parvenaient jusqu’à nous, horizontaux, affaiblis, mais denses et métalliques encore, des sons de la cloche de Saint-Hilaire qui ne s’étaient pas mélangés à l’air qu’ils traversaient depuis si longtemps, et côtelés par la palpitation successive de toutes leurs lignes sonores, vibraient en rasant les fleurs, à nos pieds.","We sat between the irises at the edge of the water. In the holiday sky, an idle cloud strolled for a long time. At times, oppressed by boredom, a carp rose out of the water in anxious aspiration. It was snack time. Before leaving we stayed for a long time eating fruit, bread and chocolate, on the grass where the sounds of the bell of Saint-Hilaire reached us, weakened, but still dense and metallic. They weren't mixed with the air they had been traversing for so long, and ribbed by the successive throbbing of all their sonorous lines, vibrated as they skimmed the flowers at our feet.","We would sit down among the irises at the edge of the water. One idle cloud would linger in the holiday sky. Now and then, oppressed by boredom, a carp would stand up from the water with an anxious gasp. It was time for our snack. Before starting off again we would stay there on the grass for a long time eating fruit, bread, and chocolate, and we would hear, coming all the way to us, horizontal, weakened, but still dense and metallic, the peals of the Saint Hilaire bell which had not melted into the air they had been traversing for so long and which, ribbed by the successive palpitation of all their waves of sound, vibrated as they brushed over the flowers, at our feet.","We would sit down among the irises at the water's edge.

Before starting homewards we would sit for a long time there, eating fruit and bread and chocolate, on the grass, over which came to our ears, horizontal, faint, but solid still and metallic, the sound of the bells of Saint-Hilaire, which had melted not at all in the atmosphere it was so well accustomed to traverse, but, broken piecemeal by the successive palpitation of all their sonorous strokes, throbbed as it brushed the flowers at our feet."
"Un jour ma mère me dit : « Puisque tu parles toujours de Mme de Guermantes, comme le docteur Percepied l’a très bien soignée il y a quatre ans, elle doit venir à Combray pour assister au mariage de sa fille. Tu pourras l’apercevoir à la cérémonie. » C’était du reste par le docteur Percepied que j’avais le plus entendu parler de Mme de Guermantes, et il nous avait même montré le numéro d’une revue illustrée où elle était représentée dans le costume qu’elle portait à un bal travesti chez la princesse de Léon.","One day my mother said to me: “Since you are still talking about Madame de Guermantes, as Doctor Percepied treated her very well four years ago, she must come to Combray to attend her daughter’s wedding. You can see him at the ceremony. It was from Doctor Percepied, moreover, that I had heard the most about Madame de Guermantes, and he had even shown us the number of an illustrated magazine in which she was represented in the costume she wore to a ball. disguised at the Princesse de Léon.","One day my mother said to me: “You’re always talking about Mme. de Guermantes. Well, because Dr. Percepied took such good care of her four years ago she’s coming to Combray to attend his daughter’s wedding.

Well, Dr. Percepied did a great deal for her when she was ill, four years ago, and so she is coming to Combray for his daughter's wedding. You will be able to see her in church. "" It was from Dr. Percepied, as it happened, that I had heard most about Mme. de Guermantes, and he had even shewn us the number of an illustrated paper in which she was depicted in the costume which she had worn at a fancy dress ball given by the Princesse de Léon."
"Enfin ma mère me disait : « Voyons, ne reste pas ici indéfiniment, monte dans ta chambre si tu as trop chaud dehors, mais va d’abord prendre l’air un instant pour ne pas lire en sortant de table. » J’allais m’asseoir près de la pompe et de son auge, souvent ornée, comme un fond gothique, d’une salamandre, qui sculptait sur la pierre fruste le relief mobile de son corps allégorique et fuselé, sur le banc sans dossier ombragé d’un lilas, dans ce petit coin du jardin qui s’ouvrait par une porte de service sur la rue du Saint-Esprit et de la terre peu soignée duquel s’élevait par deux degrés, en saillie de la maison, et comme une construction indépendante, l’arrière-cuisine. On apercevait son dallage rouge et luisant comme du porphyre. Elle avait moins l’air de l’antre de Françoise que d’un petit temple de Vénus. Elle regorgeait des offrandes du crémier, du fruitier, de la marchande de légumes, venus parfois de hameaux assez lointains pour lui dédier les prémices de leurs champs. Et son faîte était toujours couronné du roucoulement d’une colombe.","Finally my mother said to me: “Come on, don’t stay here indefinitely, go up to your room if it’s too hot outside, but first go get some fresh air so you don’t read when you get out of the table. I went to sit near the pump and its trough, often adorned, like a Gothic background, with a salamander, which sculpted on the rough stone the mobile relief of its allegorical and tapered body, on the bench without a backrest. shaded by a lilac, in this little corner of the garden which opened by a side door onto the rue du Saint-Esprit an independent building, the scullery. You could see its red pavement, shining like porphyry. It looked less like Françoise's lair than a little temple of Venus. It overflowed with offerings from the creamer, the fruiterer, the vegetable vendor, sometimes from hamlets far enough away to dedicate the first fruits of their fields to it. And its top was always crowned with the cooing of a dove.","At last my mother would say to me: “Now, don’t stay here all day, go up to your room if you’re too hot outdoors, but get a little fresh air first so that you don’t start reading right after leaving the table.” I would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough, often ornamented, like a Gothic font, with a salamander which sculpted on the rough stone the mobile relief of its allegorical tapering body, on the backless bench shaded by a lilac, in the little corner of the garden that opened through a service gate onto the rue du Saint-Esprit and from whose untended earth the scullery rose by two steps, projecting from the house like an independent structure. One could see its red paving stones gleaming like porphyry. It looked not so much like Françoise’s lair as a little temple of Venus. It overflowed with the offerings of the dairyman, the fruit man, the vegetable monger, who had come sometimes from quite remote hamlets to dedicate to it the first fruits of their fields. And its roof was forever crowned with the cooing of a dove.","At length my mother would say to me: ""Now, don't stay here all day; you can go up to your room if you are too hot outside, but get a little fresh air first; don't start reading immediately after your food."" And I would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough, ornamented here and there, like a gothic font, with a salamander, which modelled upon a background of crumbling stone the quick relief of its slender, allegorical body; on the bench without a back, in the shade of a lilac-tree, in that little corner of the garden which communicated, by a service door, with the Rue du Saint-Esprit, and from whose neglected soil rose, in two stages, an outcrop from the house itself and apparently a separate building, my aunt's back-kitchen. One could see its red-tiled floor gleaming like porphyry. It seemed not so much the cave of Françoise as a little temple of Venus. It would be overflowing with the offerings of the milkman, the fruiterer, the greengrocer, come sometimes from distant villages to dedicate here the first-fruits of their fields. And its roof was always surmounted by the cooing of a dove."
"Mais depuis que Mme de Gallardon avait signalé à sa cousine la présence de Swann, Chopin ressuscité aurait pu venir jouer lui-même toutes ses œuvres sans que Mme des Laumes pût y faire attention. Elle faisait partie d’une de ces deux moitiés de l’humanité chez qui la curiosité qu’a l’autre moitié pour les êtres qu’elle ne connaît pas est remplacée par l’intérêt pour les êtres qu’elle connaît. Comme beaucoup de femmes du faubourg Saint-Germain, la présence dans un endroit où elle se trouvait de quelqu’un de sa coterie, et auquel d’ailleurs elle n’avait rien de particulier à dire, accaparait exclusivement son attention aux dépens de tout le reste. À partir de ce moment, dans l’espoir que Swann la remarquerait, la princesse ne fit plus, comme une souris blanche apprivoisée à qui on tend puis on retire un morceau de sucre, que tourner sa figure, remplie de mille signes de connivence dénués de rapports avec le sentiment de la polonaise de Chopin, dans la direction où était Swann et si celui-ci changeait de place, elle déplaçait parallèlement son sourire aimanté.","But since Madame de Gallardon had informed her cousin of Swann's presence, the revived Chopin could have come to play all his works himself without Madame des Laumes being able to notice it. She was part of one of those two halves of humanity in which the curiosity that the other half has for the beings that it does not know is replaced by the interest for the beings that it does know. Like many women in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the presence in a place where she happened to be of someone from her coterie, and to whom, moreover, she had nothing in particular to say, monopolized her attention exclusively at the expense of everything. the rest. From that moment, in the hope that Swann would notice her, the princess did no more, like a tamed white mouse to whom one hands and then takes away a piece of sugar, but turn her face, filled with a thousand signs of complicity devoid of of relations with the feeling of Chopin's Polonaise, in the direction in which Swann was and if he changed places, she moved her loving smile parallel.","But now that Mme. de Gallardon had told her cousin that Swann was there, Chopin himself might have risen from the dead and played all his pieces in succession without Mme. des Laumes paying the slightest attention. She belonged to that half of the human race in whom the curiosity the other half feels about the people it does not know is replaced by an interest in the people it does. As with many women of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the presence in a place where she happened to be of someone from her set, though she had nothing in particular to say to him, monopolized her attention at the expense of everything else. From that moment on, in the hopes that Swann would notice her, the Princesse, like a tame white mouse when a bit of sugar is offered to it and then taken away, kept turning her face, which was filled with a thousand signs of complicity unrelated to the feeling in Chopin’s polonaise, in Swann’s direction, and if he moved, she would shift in a corresponding direction her magnetic smile.","But once Mme. de Gallardon had informed her cousin that Swann was in the room, Chopin himself might have risen from the grave and played all his works in turn without Mme. des Laumes's paying him the slightest attention. She belonged to that one of the two divisions of the human race in which the untiring curiosity which the other half feels about the people whom it does not know is replaced by an unfailing interest in the people whom it does. As with many women of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the presence, in any room in which she might find herself, of another member of her set, even although she had nothing in particular to say to him, would occupy her mind to the exclusion of every other consideration. From that moment, in the hope that Swann would catch sight of her, the Princess could do nothing but (like a tame white mouse when a lump of sugar is put down before its nose and then taken away) turn her face, in which were crowded a thousand signs of intimate connivance, none of them with the least relevance to the sentiment underlying Chopin's music, in the direction where Swann was, and, if he moved, divert accordingly the course of her magnetic smile."
"« Souvent, mais peu à la fois, comme le pauvre père Swann », était devenu une des phrases favorites de mon grand-père qui la prononçait à propos des choses les plus différentes. Il m’aurait paru que ce père de Swann était un monstre, si mon grand-père que je considérais comme meilleur juge et dont la sentence, faisant jurisprudence pour moi, m’a souvent servi dans la suite à absoudre des fautes que j’aurais été enclin à condamner, ne s’était récrié : « Mais comment ?","""Often, but little at a time, like poor Father Swann,"" had become one of my grandfather's favorite phrases, which he used to say about the most different things. It would have seemed to me that this father of Swann was a monster, if my grandfather, whom I considered the best judge and whose sentence, setting a precedent for me, often served me afterwards to absolve faults that I would have been inclined to condemn, had not exclaimed: ""But how?","“Often, but only a little at a time, like poor old Swann,” had become one of my grandfather’s favorite phrases, which he uttered apropos of the most different sorts of things. I would have thought Swann’s father was a monster, if my grandfather, whom I considered a better judge and whose pronouncement, forming a legal precedent for me, often allowed me later to dismiss offenses I might have been inclined to condemn, had not exclaimed: “What! He had a heart of gold!”","""Often, but a little at a time, like poor old Swann,"" became one of my grandfather's favourite phrases, which he would apply to all kinds of things. And I should have assumed that this father of Swann's had been a monster if my grandfather, whom I regarded as a better judge than myself, and whose word was my law and often led me in the long run to pardon offences which I should have been inclined to condemn, had not gone on to exclaim, "" But, after all, he had a heart of gold."""
"Mais Swann ne cherchait nullement à lui faire modifier cette conception du chic ; pensant que la sienne n’était pas plus vraie, était aussi sotte, dénuée d’importance, il ne trouvait aucun intérêt à en instruire sa maîtresse, si bien qu’après des mois elle ne s’intéressait aux personnes chez qui il allait que pour les cartes de pesage, de concours hippique, les billets de première qu’il pouvait avoir par elles. Elle souhaitait qu’il cultivât des relations si utiles mais elle était par ailleurs, portée à les croire peu chic, depuis qu’elle avait vu passer dans la rue la marquise de Villeparisis en robe de laine noire, avec un bonnet à brides.","But Swann in no way sought to make him modify this conception of chic; thinking that his was no more true, was just as silly, devoid of importance, he found no interest in telling his mistress about it, so that after months she was only interested in the people he went to. for weighbridge cards, horse show cards, premiere tickets that he could get from them. She wished he would cultivate such useful relations, but she was otherwise inclined to believe them unchic, since she had seen the Marquise de Villeparisis passing in the street in a black woolen dress with a strapped bonnet.","But Swann in no way tried to make her change this conception of fashionable life; thinking that his own was no more real, was also foolish, unimportant, he saw no point in instructing her about it, so that after some months she had no interest in the people whose homes he went to except as a means of obtaining enclosure passes for the horse races or tickets to the premieres. She wanted him to cultivate useful relationships of that kind, but in other respects she was persuaded they were not very smart, after she saw the Marquise de Villeparisis go past her in the street wearing a black woolen dress and a bonnet with strings.","Swann made no attempt, however, to modify this conception of fashion; feeling that his own came no nearer to the truth, was just as fatuous, devoid of all importance, he saw no advantage to be gained by imparting it to his mistress, with the result that, after a few months, she ceased to take any interest in the people to whose houses he went, except when they were the means of his obtaining tickets for the paddock at race-meetings or first-nights at the theatre. She hoped that he would continue to cultivate such profitable acquaintances, but she had come to regard them as less smart since the day when she had passed the Marquise de Villeparisis in the street, wearing a black serge dress and a bonnet with strings."

"Plus loin, là où toutes leurs feuilles vertes couvraient les arbres, un seul, petit, trapu, étêté et têtu, secouait au vent une vilaine chevelure rouge. Ailleurs encore c’était le premier éveil de ce mois de mai des feuilles, et celles d’un empelopsis merveilleux et souriant, comme une épine rose de l’hiver, depuis le matin même étaient tout en fleur. Et le Bois avait l’aspect provisoire et factice d’une pépinière ou d’un parc, où, soit dans un intérêt botanique, soit pour la préparation d’une fête, on vient d’installer, au milieu des arbres de sorte commune qui n’ont pas encore été déplantés, deux ou trois espèces précieuses aux feuillages fantastiques et qui semblent autour d’eux réserver du vide, donner de l’air, faire de la clarté. Ainsi c’était la saison où le bois de Boulogne trahit le plus d’essences diverses et juxtapose le plus de parties distinctes en un assemblage composite.","Farther away, where all their green leaves covered the trees, a single one, short, stocky, headless and stubborn, was shaking an ugly red hair in the wind. Elsewhere still it was the first awakening of this month of May of the leaves, and those of a marvelous and smiling empelopsis, like a thorn rose in winter, had since that very morning been in full bloom. And the Wood had the provisional and artificial aspect of a nursery or a park, where, either for botanical interest, or for the preparation of a feast, one has just installed, in the middle of the trees of a common sort which have not yet been uprooted, two or three precious species with fantastic foliage and which seem to keep space around them, to give air, to make light. Thus it was the season when the Bois de Boulogne betrays the most diverse essences and juxtaposes the most distinct parts in a composite assembly.","Farther off, at a place where the trees were still covered in all their green leaves, one alone, small, squat, lopped, obstinate, shook in the wind a homely head of red hair. Elsewhere, again, there was a first awakening of this May of the leaves, and those of an ampelopsis as marvelous and smiling as a pink winter hawthorn had since that same morning been all in flower. And the Bois had the temporary and artificial look of a tree nursery or a park, where for botanical purposes or in preparation for a festival, they have just placed, among the trees of a common sort that have not yet been transplanted, two or three precious species with fantastic foliage which seem to be reserving an empty space around themselves, giving air, creating light. Thus it was the season when the Bois de Boulogne reveals the most numerous different varieties and juxtaposes the most numerous distinct parts in a composite aggregation.","Farther off, at a place where the trees were still all green, one alone, small, stunted, lopped, but stubborn in its resistance, was tossing in the breeze an ugly mane of red. Elsewhere, again, might be seen the first awakening of this Maytime of the leaves, and those of an ampelopsis, a smiling miracle, like a red hawthorn flowering in winter, had that very morning all 'come out,' so to speak, in blossom. And the Bois had the temporary, unfinished, artificial look of a nursery garden or a park in which, either for some botanic purpose or in preparation for a festival, there have been embedded among the trees of commoner growth, which have not yet been uprooted and transplanted elsewhere, a few rare specimens, with fantastic foliage, which seem to be clearing all round themselves an empty space, making room, giving air, diffusing light. Thus it was the time of year at which the Bois de Boulogne displays more separate characteristics, assembles more distinct elements in a composite whole than at any other."
"Ces images étaient fausses pour une autre raison encore ; c’est qu’elles étaient forcément très simplifiées ; sans doute ce à quoi aspirait mon imagination et que mes sens ne percevaient qu’incomplètement et sans plaisir dans le présent, je l’avais enfermé dans le refuge des noms ; sans doute, parce que j’y avais accumulé du rêve, ils aimantaient maintenant mes désirs ; mais les noms ne sont pas très vastes ; c’est tout au plus si je pouvais y faire entrer deux ou trois des « curiosités » principales de la ville et elles s’y juxtaposaient sans intermédiaires ; dans le nom de Balbec, comme dans le verre grossissant de ces porte-plume qu’on achète aux bains de mer, j’apercevais des vagues soulevées autour d’une église de style persan. Peut-être même la simplification de ces images fut-elle une des causes de l’empire qu’elles prirent sur moi. Quand mon père eut décidé, une année, que nous irions passer les vacances de Pâques à Florence et à Venise, n’ayant pas la place de faire entrer dans le nom de Florence les éléments qui composent d’habitude les villes, je fus contraint à faire sortir une cité surnaturelle de la fécondation, par certains parfums printaniers, de ce que je croyais être, en son essence, le génie de Giotto. Tout au plus – et parce qu’on ne peut pas faire tenir dans un nom beaucoup plus de durée que d’espace – comme certains tableaux de Giotto eux-mêmes qui montrent à deux moments différents de l’action un même personnage, ici couché dans son lit, là s’apprêtant à monter à cheval, le nom de Florence était-il divisé en deux compartiments. Dans l’un, sous un dais architectural, je contemplais une fresque à laquelle était partiellement superposé un rideau de soleil matinal, poudreux, oblique et progressif ; dans l’autre (car ne pensant pas aux noms comme à un idéal inaccessible, mais comme à une ambiance réelle dans laquelle j’irais me plonger, la vie non vécue encore, la vie intacte et pure que j’y enfermais donnait aux plaisirs les plus matériels, aux scènes les plus simples, cet attrait qu’ils ont dans les œuvres des primitifs), je traversais rapidement – pour trouver plus vite le déjeuner qui m’attendait avec des fruits et du vin de Chianti – le Ponte-Vecchio encombré de jonquilles, de narcisses et d’anémones.","These images were wrong for yet another reason; it is that they were necessarily very simplified; no doubt what my imagination aspired to and which my senses perceived only incompletely and without pleasure in the present, I had locked up in the refuge of names; no doubt, because I had accumulated dreams there, they now magnetized my desires; but the names are not very extensive; it is at most if I could bring in two or three of the main “curiosities” of the city and they were juxtaposed there without intermediaries; in the name of Balbec, as in the magnifying glass of those penholders one buys at seaside resorts, I saw waves rising around a Persian-style church. Perhaps even the simplification of these images was one of the causes of the empire they took over me. When my father had decided, one year, that we were going to spend the Easter holidays in Florence and Venice, not having the space to include in the name of Florence the elements that usually make up cities, I was forced to bring a supernatural city out of the fertilization, by certain spring scents, of what I believed to be, in its essence, the genius of Giotto. At the very most – and because one cannot fit much more duration into a name than space – like certain paintings by Giotto themselves which show the same character, here lying down, at two different moments of the action. in bed, there getting ready to ride, was Florence's name divided into two compartments. In one, under an architectural canopy, I contemplated a fresco on which was partially superimposed a curtain of morning sun, powdery, oblique and progressive; in the other (because not thinking of names as an inaccessible ideal, but as a real atmosphere in which I would go and immerse myself, the life not yet lived, the intact and pure life that I enclosed there gave pleasures the most material, with the simplest scenes, this attraction that they have in the works of the primitives), I crossed quickly - to find more quickly the lunch which was waiting for me with fruit and Chianti wine - the Ponte-Vecchio crowded with daffodils, narcissus and anemones.","These images were false for another reason also; namely that they were necessarily quite simplified; doubtless whatever it was that my imagination aspired to and that my senses took in only incompletely and without any immediate pleasure, I had enclosed in the sanctuary of a name; doubtless because I had accumulated there a store of dreams, these names now magnetized my desires; but names themselves are not very spacious; the most I could do was include in them two or three of the towns’ principal curiosities, which would be juxtaposed there with nothing to connect them; in the name Balbec, as in the magnifying glass of the penholders you buy at a seaside resort, I saw waves rising around a Persian-style church. Perhaps indeed the simplification of these images was one of the reasons for the hold that they had over me. When my father decided, one year, that we would go spend the Easter holidays in Florence and Venice, not having enough room to insert into the name Florence the elements that usually make up a town, I was forced to produce a supernatural city from the fecundation, by certain springtime fragrances, of what I believed to be, in its essence, the spirit of Giotto. At the very most—and because one cannot attach to a name much more time than space—like certain of Giotto’s paintings themselves which show us the same figure at two different moments in the action, here lying in his bed, there getting ready to mount his horse, the name Florence was divided into two compartments. In one, under an architectural canopy, I was contemplating a fresco on part of which was superimposed a curtain of morning sunlight, dusty, oblique, and gradually spreading; in the other (for, since I did not think of names as an inaccessible ideal but as a real atmosphere in which I was going to immerse myself, the life not yet lived, the pure and intact life that I enclosed in them gave to the most material pleasures, to the simplest scenes, the attraction they have in the works of the primitives), I was walking quickly—the sooner to reach the lunch that was waiting for me with fruits and wine from Chianti—across a Ponte Vecchio crowded with jonquils, narcissus, and anemones.","These images were false for another reason also; namely, that they were necessarily much simplified; doubtless the object to which my imagination aspired, which my senses took in but incompletely and without any immediate pleasure, I had committed to the safe custody of names; doubtless because I had accumulated there a store of dreams, those names now magnetised my desires; but names themselves are not very comprehensive; the most that I could do was to include in each of them two or three of the principal curiosities of the town, which would lie there side by side, without interval or partition; in the name of Balbec, as in the magnifying glasses set in those penholders which one buys at sea-side places, I could distinguish waves surging round a church built in the Persian manner. Perhaps, indeed, the enforced simplicity of these images was one of the reasons for the hold that they had over me. When my father had decided, one year, that we should go for the Easter holidays to Florence and Venice, not finding room to introduce into the name of Florence the elements that ordinarily constitute a town, I was obliged to let a supernatural city emerge from the impregnation by certain vernal scenes of what I supposed to be, in its essentials, the genius of Giotto. All the more—and because one cannot make a name extend much further in time than in space—like some of Giotto's paintings themselves which shew us at two separate moments the same person engaged in different actions, here lying on his bed, there just about to mount his horse, the name of Florence was divided into two compartments. In one, beneath an architectural dais, I gazed upon a fresco over which was partly drawn a curtain of morning sunlight, dusty, aslant, and gradually spreading; in the other (for, since I thought of names not as an inaccessible ideal but as a real and enveloping substance into which I was about to plunge, the life not yet lived, the life intact and pure which I enclosed in them, gave to the most material pleasures, to the simplest scenes, the same attraction that they have in the works of the Primitives), I moved swiftly—so as to arrive, as soon as might be, at the table that was spread for me, with fruit and a flask of Chianti—across a Ponte Vecchio heaped with jonquils, narcissi and anemones."
"Certes, il avait trop longtemps oublié qu’il était le « fils Swann » pour ne pas ressentir, quand il le redevenait un moment, un plaisir plus vif que ceux qu’il eût pu éprouver le reste du temps et sur lesquels il était blasé ; et si l’amabilité des bourgeois, pour lesquels il restait surtout cela, était moins vive que celle de l’aristocratie (mais plus flatteuse d’ailleurs, car chez eux du moins elle ne se sépare jamais de la considération), une lettre d’altesse, quelques divertissements princiers qu’elle lui proposât, ne pouvait lui être aussi agréable que celle qui lui demandait d’être témoin, ou seulement d’assister à un mariage dans la famille de vieux amis de ses parents, dont les uns avaient continué à le voir – comme mon grand-père qui, l’année précédente, l’avait invité au mariage de ma mère – et dont certains autres le connaissaient personnellement à peine, mais se croyaient des devoirs de politesse envers le fils, envers le digne successeur de feu M. Swann.","Admittedly, he had forgotten for too long that he was the “Swann son” not to feel, when he became one again for a moment, a keener pleasure than those he could have felt the rest of the time and on which he was jaded. ; and if the friendliness of the bourgeois, for whom this above all remained, was less lively than that of the aristocracy (but more flattering moreover, for among them at least it is never separated from consideration), a letter of Highness, whatever princely entertainments she offered him, could not be as pleasant to him as that which asked him to be a witness, or only to attend a wedding in the family of old friends of his parents, some of whom had continued to see him - like my grandfather who, the previous year, had invited him to my mother's wedding - and some of whom others hardly knew him personally, but believed that they had a duty of politeness towards the son, towards the worthy successor of the late Mr. Swann.","Certainly, he had forgotten for too long that he was “young Swann” not to feel, when he became that person again briefly, a keener pleasure than those he could have felt the rest of the time and to which he had grown indifferent; and if the friendliness of the bourgeoisie, for whom he had remained that person more than anything else, was less animated than that of the aristocracy (but in fact more flattering, for with them at least it is always inseparable from respect), a letter from a royal personage, whatever princely entertainment it offered, could never be as pleasant to him as a letter asking him to be a witness, or merely to be present, at a wedding in the family of old friends of his parents, some of whom had continued to see him—like my grandfather, who, the year before, had invited him to my mother’s wedding—while certain others barely knew him personally but believed they were obligated to be polite to the son, to the worthy successor, of the late M. Swann.","Of a truth, he had too long forgotten that he was 'young Swann' not to feel, when he assumed that part again for a moment, a keener pleasure than he was capable of feeling at other times—when, indeed, he was grown sick of pleasure; and if the friendliness of the middle-class people, for whom he had never been anything else than 'young Swann,' was less animated than that of the aristocrats (though more flattering, for all that, since in the middle-class mind friendship is inseparable from respect), no letter from a Royal Personage, offering him some princely entertainment, could ever be so attractive to Swann as the letter which asked him to be a witness, or merely to be present at a wedding in the family of some old friends of his parents; some of whom had 'kept up' with him, like my grandfather, who, the year before these events, had invited him to my mother's wedding, while others barely knew him by sight, but were, they thought, in duty bound to shew civility to the son, to the worthy successor of the late M. Swann."
"En attendant je relisais une page que ne m’avait pas écrite Gilberte, mais qui du moins me venait d’elle, cette page de Bergotte sur la beauté des vieux mythes dont s’est inspiré Racine, et que, à côté de la bille d’agathe, je gardais toujours auprès de moi. J’étais attendri par la bonté de mon amie qui me l’avait fait rechercher ; et comme chacun a besoin de trouver des raisons à sa passion, jusqu’à être heureux de reconnaître dans l’être qu’il aime des qualités que la littérature ou la conversation lui ont appris être de celles qui sont dignes d’exciter l’amour, jusqu’à les assimiler par imitation et en faire des raisons nouvelles de son amour, ces qualités fussent-elles les plus oppressées à celles que cet amour eût recherchées tant qu’il était spontané – comme Swann autrefois le caractère esthétique de la beauté d’Odette – moi, qui avais d’abord aimé Gilberte, dès Combray, à cause de tout l’inconnu de sa vie, dans lequel j’aurais voulu me précipiter, m’incarner, en délaissant la mienne qui ne m’était plus rien, je pensais maintenant comme à un inestimable avantage, que de cette mienne vie trop connue, dédaignée, Gilberte pourrait devenir un jour l’humble servante, la commode et confortable collaboratrice, qui le soir, m’aidant dans mes travaux, collationnerait pour moi des brochures. Quant à Bergotte, ce vieillard infiniment sage et presque divin à cause de qui j’avais d’abord aimé Gilberte, avant même de l’avoir vue, maintenant c’était surtout à cause de Gilberte que je l’aimais. Avec autant de plaisir que les pages qu’il avait écrites sur Racine, je regardais le papier fermé de grands cachets de cire blancs et noué d’un flot de rubans mauves dans lequel elle me les avait apportées. Je baisai la bille d’agate qui était la meilleure part du cœur de mon amie, la part qui n’était pas frivole, mais fidèle, et qui bien que parée du charme mystérieux de la vie de Gilberte demeurait près de moi, habitait ma chambre, couchait dans mon lit. Mais la beauté de cette pierre, et la beauté aussi de ces pages de Bergotte, que j’étais heureux d’associer à l’idée de mon amour pour Gilberte comme si dans les moments où celui-ci ne m’apparaissait plus que comme un néant, elles lui donnaient une sorte de consistance, je m’apercevais qu’elles étaient antérieures à cet amour, qu’elles ne lui ressemblaient pas, que leurs éléments avaient été fixés par le talent ou par les lois minéralogiques avant que Gilberte ne me connût, que rien dans le livre ni dans la pierre n’eût été autre si Gilberte ne m’avait pas aimé, et que rien par conséquent ne m’autorisait à lire en eux un message de bonheur. Et tandis que mon amour, attendant sans cesse du lendemain l’aveu de celui de Gilberte, annulait, défaisait chaque soir le travail mal fait de la journée, dans l’ombre de moi-même une ouvrière inconnue ne laissait pas au rebut les fils arrachés, et les disposait, sans souci de me plaire et de travailler à mon bonheur, dans un ordre différent qu’elle donnait à tous ses ouvrages. Ne portant aucun intérêt particulier à mon amour, ne commençant pas par décider que j’étais aimé, elle recueillait les actions de Gilberte qui m’avaient semblé inexplicables et ses fautes que j’avais excusées. Alors les unes et les autres prenaient un sens. Il semblait dire, cet ordre nouveau, qu’en voyant Gilberte, au lieu qu’elle vînt aux Champs-Élysées, aller à une matinée, faire des courses avec son institutrice et se préparer à une absence pour les vacances du jour de l’an, j’avais tort de penser, de me dire : « c’est qu’elle est frivole ou docile. » Car elle eût cessé d’être l’un ou l’autre si elle m’avait aimé, et si elle avait été forcée d’obéir, c’eût été avec le même désespoir que j’avais les jours où je ne la voyais pas. Il disait encore, cet ordre nouveau, que je devais pourtant savoir ce que c’était qu’aimer puisque j’aimais Gilberte ; il me faisait remarquer le souci perpétuel que j’avais de me faire valoir à ses yeux, à cause duquel j’essayais de persuader à ma mère d’acheter à Françoise un caoutchouc et un chapeau avec un plumet bleu, ou plutôt de ne plus m’envoyer aux Champs-Élysées avec cette bonne dont je rougissais (à quoi ma mère répondait que j’étais injuste pour Françoise, que c’était une brave femme qui nous était dévouée), et aussi ce besoin unique de voir Gilberte qui faisait que des mois d’avance je ne pensais qu’à tâcher d’apprendre à quelle époque elle quitterait Paris et où elle irait, trouvant le pays le plus agréable un lieu d’exil si elle ne devait pas y être, et ne désirant que rester toujours à Paris tant que je pourrais la voir aux Champs-Élysées ; et il n’avait pas de peine à me montrer que ce souci-là, ni ce besoin, je ne les trouverais sous les actions de Gilberte. Elle au contraire appréciait son institutrice, sans s’inquiéter de ce que j’en pensais. Elle trouvait naturel de ne pas venir aux Champs-Élysées, si c’était pour aller faire des emplettes avec Mademoiselle, agréable si c’était pour sortir avec sa mère. Et à supposer même qu’elle m’eût permis d’aller passer les vacances au même endroit qu’elle, du moins pour choisir cet endroit elle s’occupait du désir de ses parents, de mille amusements dont on lui avait parlé et nullement que ce fût celui où ma famille avait l’intention de m’envoyer.","In the meantime I was rereading a page that Gilberte had not written to me, but which at least came to me from her, this page from Bergotte on the beauty of the old myths which inspired Racine, and which, alongside the marble of agathe, I always kept close to me. I was touched by the kindness of my friend who had made me look for him; and as everyone needs to find reasons for his passion, to the point of being happy to recognize in the being he loves qualities which literature or conversation have taught him to be those which are worthy of exciting the love, to the point of assimilating them by imitation and turning them into new reasons for his love, even if these qualities were the most oppressed of those that this love would have sought as long as it was spontaneous – like Swann of old, the aesthetic character of beauty of Odette – I, who had first loved Gilberte, from Combray, because of all the unknown in her life, into which I would have liked to rush, incarnate myself, abandoning my own which was not mine. nothing more, I thought now as an inestimable advantage, that of my life too well known, despised, Gilberte could one day become the humble servant, the convenient and comfortable collaborator, who in the evening, helping me in my work, would collate pamphlets for me. As for Bergotte, that infinitely wise and almost divine old man on account of whom I had first loved Gilberte, even before having seen her, now it was above all because of Gilberte that I loved her. With as much pleasure as the pages he had written on Racine, I looked at the paper closed with large white wax seals and tied with a stream of mauve ribbons in which she had brought them to me. I kissed the agate marble which was the best part of my friend's heart, the part which was not frivolous but faithful, and which, although adorned with the mysterious charm of Gilberte's life, remained close to me, inhabited my bedroom, slept in my bed. But the beauty of this stone, and the beauty also of these pages of Bergotte, which I was happy to associate with the idea of my love for Gilberte as if in the moments when the latter only appeared to me as a nothingness, they gave it a kind of consistency, I realized that they were prior to this love, that they did not resemble it, that their elements had been fixed by talent or by mineralogical laws before Gilberte knew me, that nothing in the book or in the stone would have been different if Gilberte had not loved me, and that nothing consequently authorized me to read in them a message of happiness. And while my love, incessantly awaiting the next day's confession of Gilberte's, canceled and undid each evening the badly done work of the day, in the shadow of myself an unknown worker did not discard the threads torn out, and arranged them, without worrying about pleasing me and working for my happiness, in a different order that she gave to all her works. Bearing no particular interest in my love, not beginning by deciding that I was loved, she recorded Gilberte's actions which had seemed to me inexplicable and her faults which I had excused. So both made sense. It seemed to say, this new order, that seeing Gilberte, instead of her coming to the Champs-Élysées, to go to a matinee, go shopping with her teacher and prepare for an absence for the holidays on the day of the year, I was wrong to think, to say to myself: ""it's because she's frivolous or docile."" For she would have ceased to be one or the other if she had loved me, and if she had been forced to obey, it would have been with the same despair that I had on the days when I did not see her. didn't see. He said again, this new order, that I must nevertheless know what it was to love since I loved Gilberte; he pointed out to me the perpetual concern I had to show off in his eyes, because of which I tried to persuade my mother to buy Françoise a rubber hat and a hat with a blue plume, or rather not to stop. send me to the Champs-Élysées with that maid I used to blush about (to which my mother replied that I was unfair to Françoise, that she was a good woman who was devoted to us), and also this unique need to see Gilberte who that months in advance I thought only of trying to find out when she would leave Paris and where she would go, finding the most agreeable country a place of exile if she were not to be there, and desiring only always stay in Paris as long as I can see her on the Champs-Élysées; and he had no difficulty in showing me that I would find neither that care nor that need under Gilberte's actions. She, on the contrary, liked her teacher, without worrying about what I thought of her. She found it natural not to come to the Champs-Élysées if it was to go shopping with Mademoiselle, pleasant if it was to go out with her mother. And even supposing that she had allowed me to go and spend the holidays in the same place as her, at least to choose this place she was concerned with the wishes of her parents, with a thousand amusements of which she had been told and in no way that it was where my family intended to send me.","Meanwhile I reread a page which had not been written to me by Gilberte, but which at least came to me from her, that page by Bergotte on the beauty of the old myths that inspired Racine, and which, next to the agate marble, I kept near me always. I was moved by the goodness of my friend who had had someone find it for me; and because everyone needs to discover reasons for his passion, so much so that he is happy to recognize in the person he loves qualities which literature or conversation have taught him are among those worthy of inspiring love, so much so that he assimilates them by imitation and makes them new reasons for his love, even if these qualities were the most diametrically opposed to those his love would have sought so long as it remained spontaneous—as Swann had done once upon a time, with the aesthetic nature of Odette’s beauty—I, who had at first loved Gilberte, back in Combray, because of all that was unknown about her life, into which I would have liked to hurl myself, become incarnated, abandoning my own life which was no longer anything to me, I now thought, as of an inestimable advantage, that of this life of mine, too well known, disdained, Gilberte might one day become the humble servant, the companionable and comfortable collaborator who in the evening, helping me in my work, would compare and collate pamphlets for me. As for Bergotte, that infinitely wise and almost divine old man because of whom I had first loved Gilberte, even before I saw her, now it was above all because of Gilberte that I loved him. With as much pleasure as the pages he had written on Racine, I looked at the paper closed with great seals of white wax and tied with a cascade of mauve ribbons in which she had brought them to me. I kissed the agate marble which was the best part of my friend’s heart, the part that was not frivolous, but faithful, and which even though adorned with the mysterious charm of Gilberte’s life remained close to me, lived in my bedroom, slept in my bed. But as for the beauty of that stone, and the beauty also of those pages by Bergotte, which I was so pleased to associate with the idea of my love for Gilberte, as if in the moments when that love appeared to me to be nothing at all they gave it a sort of substance, I saw that they were anterior to that love, that they did not resemble it, that their elements had been determined by talent or by the laws of mineralogy before Gilberte knew me, that nothing in the book or in the stone would have been different if Gilberte had not loved me and that consequently nothing entitled me to read in them a message of happiness. And while my love, ceaselessly expecting from the next day an avowal of Gilberte’s love, annulled and undid each evening the badly done work of the day, in the darkness inside me an unknown seamstress did not leave the pulled threads in the scrap heap but arranged them, with no concern for pleasing me or working for my happiness, in the different order to which she gave all her work. Showing no particular interest in my love, nor beginning by deciding that I was indeed loved, she gathered up those of Gilberte’s actions which had seemed inexplicable to me, along with her faults, which I had excused. Then the first and the second acquired a meaning. It seemed to say, this new order, that when I saw that Gilberte, instead of coming to the Champs-Élysées, attended a party, went shopping with her governess, and prepared to be away over the New Year’s holidays , I was wrong to think: “ It’s because she’s frivolous or submissive.” For she would have ceased to be either if she had loved me, and if she had been forced to obey it would have been with the same despair that I felt on the days when I did not see her. It told me further, this new order, that I must after all know what it was to love since I loved Gilberte; it pointed out to me the perpetual concern I felt to show myself to advantage in her eyes, because of which I tried to persuade my mother to buy Françoise a waterproof coat and a hat with a blue ostrich feather, or better still not to continue sending me to the Champs-Élysées with that maid who made me blush (to which my mother answered that I was unfair to Françoise, that she was a good woman and devoted to us), and also that exclusive need to see Gilberte because of which months in advance I thought only of trying to learn at what time of the year she would be leaving Paris and where she would be going, finding even the most pleasant countryside a place of exile if she was not going to be there, and wanting only to stay in Paris all the time as long as I could see her at the Champs-Élysées; and it had no difficulty showing me that I would not find that concern, or that need, behind Gilberte’s actions. She on the contrary appreciated her governess, without worrying about what I thought of her. She found it natural not to come to the Champs-Élysées, if she was going to make some purchases with Mademoiselle, pleasant if she was going out with her mother. And even supposing she would have allowed me to spend the holidays in the same place as she, at least in choosing that place she considered her parents’ desires, the thousand amusements she had heard about, and not in the least that this was the place where my family was intending to send me.","While I waited I read over again a page which, although it had not been written to me by Gilberte, came to me, none the less, from her, that page by Bergotte upon the beauty of the old myths from which Racine drew his inspiration, which (with the agate marble) I always kept within reach. I was touched by my friend's kindness in having procured the book for me; and as everyone is obliged to find some reason for his passion, so much so that he is glad to find in the creature whom he loves qualities which (he has learned by reading or in conversation) are worthy to excite a man's love, that he assimilates them by imitation and makes out of them fresh reasons for his love, even although these qualities be diametrically opposed to those for which his love would have sought, so long as it was spontaneous—as Swann, before my day, had sought to establish the aesthetic basis of Odette's beauty—I, who had at first loved Gilberte, in Combray days, on account of all the unknown element in her life into which I would fain have plunged headlong, have undergone reincarnation, discarding my own separate existence as a thing that no longer mattered, I thought now, as of an inestimable advantage, that of this, my own, my too familiar, my contemptible existence Gilberte might one day become the humble servant, the kindly, the comforting collaborator, who in the evenings, helping me in my work, would collate for me the texts of rare pamphlets. As for Bergotte, that infinitely wise, almost divine old man, because of whom I had first, before I had even seen her, loved Gilberte, now it was for Gilberte's sake, chiefly, that I loved him. With as much pleasure as the pages that he had written about Racine, I studied the wrapper, folded under great seals of white wax and tied with billows of pink ribbon, in which she had brought those pages to me. I kissed the agate marble, which was the better part of my love's heart, the part that was not frivolous but faithful, and, for all that it was adorned with the mysterious charm of Gilberte's life, dwelt close beside me, inhabited my chamber, shared my bed. But the beauty of that stone, and the beauty also of those pages of Bergotte which I was glad to associate with the idea of my love for Gilberte, as if, in the moments when my love seemed no longer to have any existence, they gave it a kind of consistency, were, I perceived, anterior to that love, which they in no way resembled; their elements had been determined by the writer's talent, or by geological laws, before ever Gilberte had known me, nothing in book or stone would have been different if Gilberte had not loved me, and there was nothing, consequently, that authorised me to read in them a message of happiness. And while my love, incessantly waiting for the morrow to bring a confession of Gilberte's love for me, destroyed, unravelled every evening, the ill-done work of the day, in some shadowed part of my being was an unknown weaver who would not leave where they lay the severed threads, but collected and rearranged them, without any thought of pleasing me, or of toiling for my advantage, in the different order which she gave to all her handiwork. Without any special interest in my love, not beginning by deciding that I was loved, she placed, side by side, those of Gilberte's actions that had seemed to me inexplicable and her faults which I had excused. Then, one with another, they took on a meaning. It seemed to tell me, this new arrangement, that when I saw Gilberte, instead of coming to me in the Champs-Elysées, going to a party, or on errands with her governess, when I saw her prepared for an absence that would extend over the New Year holidays, I was wrong in thinking, in saying: ""It is because she is frivolous,"" or ""easily lead. "" For she would have ceased to be either if she had loved me, and if she had been forced to obey it would have been with the same despair in her heart that I felt on the days when I did not see her. It shewed me further, this new arrangement, that I ought, after all, to know what it was to love, since I loved Gilberte; it drew my attention to the constant anxiety that I had to 'shew off' before her, by reason of which I tried to persuade my mother to get for Françoise a waterproof coat and a hat with a blue feather, or, better still, to stop sending with me to the Champs-Elysées an attendant with whom I blushed to be seen (to all of which my mother replied that I was not fair to Françoise, that she was an excellent woman and devoted to us all) and also that sole, exclusive need to see Gilberte, the result of which was that, months in advance, I could think of nothing but how to find out at what date she would be leaving Paris and where she was going, feeling that the most attractive country in the world would be but a place of exile if she were not to be there, and asking only to be allowed to stay for ever in Paris, so long as I might see her in the Champs-Elysées; and it had little difficulty in making me see that neither my anxiety nor my need could be justified by anything in Gilberte's conduct. She, on the contrary, was genuinely fond of her governess, without troubling herself over what I might choose to think about it. It seemed quite natural to her not to come to the Champs-Elysées if she had to go shopping with Mademoiselle, delightful if she had to go out somewhere with her mother. And even supposing that she would ever have allowed me to spend my holidays in the same place as herself, when it came to choosing that place she considered her parents' wishes, a thousand different amusements of which she had been told, and not at all that it should be the place to which my family were proposing to send me."
"Oh ! c’est frappant, il a les mêmes sourcils circonflexes, le même nez recourbé, les mêmes pommettes saillantes. Quand il aura une barbiche ce sera la même personne. En tout cas il a du goût, car Bergotte est un charmant esprit. Et voyant combien j’avais l’air d’admirer Bergotte, Swann qui ne parlait jamais des gens qu’il connaissait fit, par bonté, une exception et me dit :","Oh ! it's striking, he has the same circumflex eyebrows, the same curved nose, the same high cheekbones.

"Mais savoir que sous cette chrysalide nouvelle, c’était toujours Odette qui vivait, toujours la même volonté fugace, insaisissable et sournoise, suffisait à Swann pour qu’il continuât de mettre la même passion à chercher à la capter.

And that would console him, a little, for all the sufferings that he voluntarily endured on her account."

"Enfin, en continuant à suivre du dedans au dehors les états simultanément juxtaposés dans ma conscience, et avant d’arriver jusqu’à l’horizon réel qui les enveloppait, je trouve des plaisirs d’un autre genre, celui d’être bien assis, de sentir la bonne odeur de l’air, de ne pas être dérangé par une visite : et, quand une heure sonnait au clocher de Saint-Hilaire, de voir tomber morceau par morceau ce qui de l’après-midi était déjà consommé, jusqu’à ce que j’entendisse le dernier coup qui me permettait de faire le total et après lequel, le long silence qui le suivait semblait faire commencer, dans le ciel bleu, toute la partie qui m’était encore concédée pour lire jusqu’au bon dîner qu’apprêtait Françoise et qui me réconforterait des fatigues prises, pendant la lecture du livre, à la suite de son héros. Et à chaque heure il me semblait que c’était quelques instants seulement auparavant que la précédente avait sonné ; la plus récente venait s’inscrire tout près de l’autre dans le ciel et je ne pouvais croire que soixante minutes eussent tenu dans ce petit arc bleu qui était compris entre leurs deux marques d’or. Quelquefois même cette heure prématurée sonnait deux coups de plus que la dernière ; il y en avait donc une que je n’avais pas entendue, quelque chose qui avait eu lieu n’avait pas eu lieu pour moi ; l’intérêt de la lecture, magique comme un profond sommeil, avait donné le change à mes oreilles hallucinées et effacé la cloche d’or sur la surface azurée du silence. Beaux après-midi du dimanche sous le marronnier du jardin de Combray, soigneusement vidés par moi des incidents médiocres de mon existence personnelle que j’y avais remplacés par une vie d’aventures et d’aspirations étranges au sein d’un pays arrosé d’eaux vives, vous m’évoquez encore cette vie quand je pense à vous et vous la contenez en effet pour l’avoir peu à peu contournée et enclose – tandis que je progressais dans ma lecture et que tombait la chaleur du jour – dans le cristal successif, lentement changeant et traversé de feuillages, de vos heures silencieuses, sonores, odorantes et limpides.","Finally, by continuing to follow from inside to outside the states simultaneously juxtaposed in my consciousness, and before arriving at the real horizon which enveloped them, I find pleasures of another kind, that of being well seated. , to smell the good smell of the air, not to be disturbed by a visit: and, when one o'clock struck at the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, to see fall piece by piece what of the afternoon had already been consumed , until I heard the last knock that allowed me to sum up and after which, the long silence that followed it seemed to begin, in the blue sky, all the part that was still conceded to me to read until to the good dinner which Françoise was preparing and which would comfort me from the fatigue taken, while reading the book, following its hero. And each hour it seemed to me that it was only a few moments before that the previous one had rung; the most recent was inscribed quite close to the other in the sky, and I could not believe that sixty minutes had lasted in that little blue arc which was comprised between their two golden marks. Sometimes even this premature hour struck two bells earlier than the last; so there was one that I had not heard, something that had taken place had not taken place for me; the interest in reading, magical as a deep sleep, had deceived my hallucinated ears and erased the golden bell on the azure surface of silence. Fine Sunday afternoons under the chestnut tree in the garden of Combray, carefully emptied by me of the mediocre incidents of my personal existence which I had replaced there by a life of adventures and strange aspirations within a country sprinkled with living waters, you still evoke this life to me when I think of you and you contain it in fact for having circumvented and enclosed it little by little – while I progressed in my reading and the heat of the day fell – in the successive crystal, slowly changing and traversed by foliage, of your silent, sonorous, fragrant and limpid hours.","Lastly, continuing to trace from the inside to the outside these states simultaneously juxtaposed in my consciousness, and before reaching the real horizon that enveloped them, I find pleasures of another kind, the pleasure of being comfortably seated, of smelling the good scent of the air, of not being disturbed by a visit; and, when an hour rang in the bell tower of Saint-Hilaire, of seeing fall piece by piece what was already consumed of the afternoon, until I heard the last stroke, which allowed me to add up the total and after which the long silence that followed it seemed to commence in the blue sky that whole part that was still granted me for reading until the good dinner which Françoise was preparing and which would restore me from the hardships I had incurred, during the reading of the book, in pursuit of its hero. And at each hour it would seem to me only a few moments since the preceding hour had rung; the most recent would come and inscribe itself close to the other in the sky, and I would not be able to believe that sixty minutes were held in that little blue arc comprised between their two marks of gold. Sometimes, even, this premature hour would ring two strokes more than the last; there was therefore one that I had not heard, something that had taken place had not taken place for me; the interest of the reading, as magical as a deep sleep, had deceived my hallucinated ears and erased the golden bell from the azure surface of the silence. Lovely Sunday afternoons under the chestnut tree in the garden at Combray, carefully emptied by me of the ordinary incidents of my own existence, which I had replaced by a life of foreign adventures and foreign aspirations in the heart of a country washed by running waters, you still evoke that life for me when I think of you and you contain it in fact from having gradually encircled and enclosed it—while I went on with my reading in the falling heat of the day—in the crystalline succession, slowly changing and spanned by leafy branches, of your silent, sonorous, redolent, and limpid hours.","And then, as I continue to trace the outward course of these impressions from their close-packed intimate source in my consciousness, and before I come to the horizon of reality which envelops them, I discover pleasures of another kind, those of being comfortably seated, of tasting the good scent on the air, of not being disturbed by any visitor; and, when an hour chimed from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, of watching what was already spent of the afternoon fall drop by drop until I heard the last stroke which enabled me to add up the total sum, after which the silence that followed seemed to herald the beginning, in the blue sky above me, of that long part of the day still allowed me for reading, until the good dinner which Françoise was even now preparing should come to strengthen and refresh me after the strenuous pursuit of its hero through the pages of my book. And, as each hour struck, it would seem to me that a few seconds only had passed since the hour before; the latest would inscribe itself, close to its predecessor, on the sky's surface, and I would be unable to believe that sixty minutes could be squeezed into the tiny arc of blue which was comprised between their two golden figures. Sometimes it would even happen that this precocious hour would sound two strokes more than the last; there must then have been an hour which I had not heard strike; something which had taken place had not taken place for me; the fascination of my book, a magic as potent as the deepest slumber, had stopped my enchanted ears and had obliterated the sound of that golden bell from the azure surface of the enveloping silence. Sweet Sunday afternoons beneath the chestnut-tree in our Combray garden, from which I was careful to eliminate every commonplace incident of my actual life, replacing them by a career of strange adventures and ambitions in a land watered by living streams, you still recall those adventures and ambitions to my mind when I think of you, and you embody and preserve them by virtue of having little by little drawn round and enclosed them (while I went on with my book and the heat of the day declined) in the gradual crystallisation, slowly altering in form and dappled with a pattern of chestnut-leaves, of your silent, sonorous, fragrant, limpid hours."
"Mais, sans oser les regarder qu’à la dérobée, je sentais que ces apprêts pompeux étaient vivants et que c’était la nature elle-même qui, en creusant ces découpures dans les feuilles, en ajoutant l’ornement suprême de ces blancs boutons, avait rendu cette décoration digne de ce qui était à la fois une réjouissance populaire et une solennité mystique. Plus haut s’ouvraient leurs corolles çà et là avec une grâce insouciante, retenant si négligemment comme un dernier et vaporeux atour le bouquet d’étamines, fines comme des fils de la Vierge, qui les embrumait tout entières, qu’en suivant, qu’en essayant de mimer au fond de moi le geste de leur efflorescence, je l’imaginais comme si ç’avait été le mouvement de tête étourdi et rapide, au regard coquet, aux pupilles diminuées, d’une blanche jeune fille, distraite et vive.","But, without daring to look at them only on the sly, I felt that these pompous preparations were alive and that it was nature itself which, by digging these cutouts in the leaves, by adding the supreme ornament of these white buttons , had made this decoration worthy of what was at once a popular rejoicing and a mystical solemnity. Higher up their corollas opened here and there with a carefree grace, so negligently retaining like a last and vaporous skirt the bouquet of stamens, fine as the threads of the Virgin, which misted them entirely, that following, that 'while trying to mimic the gesture of their efflorescence deep inside me, I imagined it as if it had been the dazed and rapid movement of the head, with a coquettish gaze, with diminished pupils, of a white young girl, distracted and live.","But, though I dared not do more than steal a glance at them, I felt that the ceremonious preparations were alive and that it was nature herself who, by carving those indentations in the leaves, by adding the supreme ornament of those white buds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a popular festivity and a mystical celebration. Higher up, their corollas opened here and there with a careless grace, still holding so casually, like a last and vaporous adornment, the bouquets of stamens, delicate as gossamer, which clouded them entirely, that in following, in trying to mime deep inside myself the motion of their flowering, I imagined it as the quick and thoughtless movement of the head, with coquettish glance and contracted eyes, of a young girl in white, dreamy and alive.","Though I dared not look at them save through my fingers, I could feel that the formal scheme was composed of living things, and that it was Nature herself who, by trimming the shape of the foliage, and by adding the crowning ornament of those snowy buds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a public rejoicing and a solemn mystery. Higher up on the altar, a flower had opened here and there with a careless grace, holding so unconcernedly, like a final, almost vaporous bedizening, its bunch of stamens, slender as gossamer, which clouded the flower itself in a white mist, that in following these with my eyes, in trying to imitate, somewhere inside myself, the action of their blossoming, I imagined it as a swift and thoughtless movement of the head with an enticing glance from her contracted pupils, by a young girl in white, careless and alive."
"Swann s’était avancé, sur l’insistance de Mme de Saint-Euverte et pour entendre un air d’Orphée qu’exécutait un flûtiste, s’était mis dans un coin où il avait malheureusement comme seule perspective deux dames déjà mûres assises l’une à côté de l’autre, la marquise de Cambremer et la vicomtesse de Franquetot, lesquelles, parce qu’elles étaient cousines, passaient leur temps dans les soirées, portant leurs sacs et suivies de leurs filles, à se chercher comme dans une gare et n’étaient tranquilles que quand elles avaient marqué, par leur éventail ou leur mouchoir, deux places voisines : Mme de Cambremer, comme elle avait très peu de relations, étant d’autant plus heureuse d’avoir une compagne, Mme de Franquetot, qui était au contraire très lancée, trouvait quelque chose d’élégant, d’original, à montrer à toutes ses belles connaissances qu’elle leur préférait une dame obscure avec qui elle avait en commun des souvenirs de jeunesse. Plein d’une mélancolique ironie, Swann les regardait écouter l’intermède de piano (« Saint François parlant aux oiseaux », de Liszt) qui avait succédé à l’air de flûte, et suivre le jeu vertigineux du virtuose, Mme de Franquetot anxieusement, les yeux éperdus comme si les touches sur lesquelles il courait avec agilité avaient été une suite de trapèzes d’où il pouvait tomber d’une hauteur de quatre-vingts mètres, et non sans lancer à sa voisine des regards d’étonnement, de dénégation qui signifiaient : « Ce n’est pas croyable, je n’aurais jamais pensé qu’un homme pût faire cela », Mme de Cambremer, en femme qui a reçu une forte éducation musicale, battant la mesure avec sa tête transformée en balancier de métronome dont l’amplitude et la rapidité d’oscillations d’une épaule à l’autre étaient devenues telles (avec cette espèce d’égarement et d’abandon du regard qu’ont les douleurs qui ne se connaissent plus ni ne cherchent à se maîtriser et disent : « Que voulez-vous ! ») qu’à tout moment elle accrochait avec ses solitaires les pattes de son corsage et était obligée de redresser les raisins noirs qu’elle avait dans les cheveux, sans cesser pour cela d’accélérer le mouvement. De l’autre côté de Mme de Franquetot, mais un peu en avant, était la marquise de Gallardon, occupée à sa pensée favorite, l’alliance qu’elle avait avec les Guermantes et d’où elle tirait pour le monde et pour elle-même beaucoup de gloire avec quelque honte, les plus brillants d’entre eux la tenant un peu à l’écart, peut-être parce qu’elle était ennuyeuse, ou parce qu’elle était méchante, ou parce qu’elle était d’une branche inférieure, ou peut-être sans aucune raison. Quand elle se trouvait auprès de quelqu’un qu’elle ne connaissait pas, comme en ce moment auprès de Mme de Franquetot, elle souffrait que la conscience qu’elle avait de sa parenté avec les Guermantes ne pût se manifester extérieurement en caractères visibles comme ceux qui, dans les mosaïques des églises byzantines, placés les uns au-dessous des autres, inscrivent en une colonne verticale, à côté d’un Saint Personnage, les mots qu’il est censé prononcer. Elle songeait en ce moment qu’elle n’avait jamais reçu une invitation ni une visite de sa jeune cousine la princesse des Laumes, depuis six ans que celle-ci était mariée. Cette pensée la remplissait de colère, mais aussi de fierté ; car, à force de dire aux personnes qui s’étonnaient de ne pas la voir chez Mme des Laumes, que c’est parce qu’elle aurait été exposée à y rencontrer la princesse Mathilde – ce que sa famille ultra-légitimiste ne lui aurait jamais pardonné – elle avait fini par croire que c’était en effet la raison pour laquelle elle n’allait pas chez sa jeune cousine. Elle se rappelait pourtant qu’elle avait demandé plusieurs fois à Mme des Laumes comment elle pourrait faire pour la rencontrer, mais ne se le rappelait que confusément et d’ailleurs neutralisait et au delà ce souvenir un peu humiliant en murmurant : « Ce n’est tout de même pas à moi à faire les premiers pas, j’ai vingt ans de plus qu’elle. » Grâce à la vertu de ces paroles intérieures, elle rejetait fièrement en arrière ses épaules détachées de son buste et sur lesquelles sa tête posée presque horizontalement faisait penser à la tête « rapportée » d’un orgueilleux faisan qu’on sert sur une table avec toutes ses plumes. Ce n’est pas qu’elle ne fût par nature courtaude, hommasse et boulotte ; mais les camouflets l’avaient redressée comme ces arbres qui, nés dans une mauvaise position au bord d’un précipice, sont forcés de croître en arrière pour garder leur équilibre. Obligée, pour se consoler de ne pas être tout à fait l’égale des autres Guermantes, de se dire sans cesse que c’était par intransigeance de principes et fierté qu’elle les voyait peu, cette pensée avait fini par modeler son corps et par lui enfanter une sorte de prestance qui passait aux yeux des bourgeoises pour un signe de race et troublait quelquefois d’un désir fugitif le regard fatigué des hommes de cercle. Si on avait fait subir à la conversation de Mme de Gallardon ces analyses qui en relevant la fréquence plus ou moins grande de chaque terme permettent de découvrir la clef d’un langage chiffré, on se fût rendu compte qu’aucune expression, même la plus usuelle, n’y revenait aussi souvent que « chez mes cousins de Guermantes », « chez ma tante de Guermantes », « la santé d’Elzéar de Guermantes », « la baignoire de ma cousine de Guermantes ». Quand on lui parlait d’un personnage illustre, elle répondait que, sans le connaître personnellement, elle l’avait rencontré mille fois chez sa tante de Guermantes, mais elle répondait cela d’un ton si glacial et d’une voix si sourde qu’il était clair que si elle ne le connaissait pas personnellement, c’était en vertu de tous les principes indéracinables et entêtés auxquels ses épaules touchaient en arrière, comme à ces échelles sur lesquelles les professeurs de gymnastique vous font étendre pour vous développer le thorax.","Swann had advanced, at the insistence of Madame de Saint-Euverte and to hear an air from Orpheus performed by a flautist, had placed himself in a corner where, unfortunately, his only perspective was two ladies already mature seated there. side by side, the Marquise de Cambremer and the Vicomtesse de Franquetot, who, because they were cousins, spent their time at parties, carrying their bags and followed by their daughters, looking for each other as in a station and were only quiet when they had marked, with their fan or their handkerchief, two neighboring places: Madame de Cambremer, as she had very few acquaintances, being all the happier to have a companion, Madame de Franquetot , who was on the contrary very launched, found something elegant, original, to show all her beautiful acquaintances that she preferred an obscure lady with whom she had memories of youth in common. Full of melancholy irony, Swann watched them listen to the piano interlude (""Saint Francis speaking to the birds"", by Liszt) which had succeeded the flute aria, and anxiously follow the dizzying playing of the virtuoso, Madame de Franquetot. , his eyes bewildered as if the keys on which he ran with agility had been a series of trapezes from which he could fall from a height of eighty meters, and not without throwing at his neighbor looks of astonishment, denial which meant: ""It's unbelievable, I would never have thought that a man could do that"", Mme de Cambremer, as a woman who had received a strong musical education, beating time with her head transformed into a pendulum of a metronome whose amplitude and rapidity of oscillations from one shoulder to the other had become such (with that sort of wandering self-control and say, ""What do you want!"") that at any time t she hooked the legs of her bodice with her solitaires and was obliged to straighten the black grapes in her hair, without ceasing to accelerate the movement for that. On the other side of Madame de Franquetot, but a little in front, was the Marquise de Gallardon, occupied with her favorite thought, the alliance she had with the Guermantes and from which she drew for the world and for herself. -even a lot of fame with some shame, the brightest of them keeping her a little aside, maybe because she was boring, or because she was mean, or because she was d 'a lower branch, or maybe for no reason. When she found herself with someone she did not know, as at this moment with Madame de Franquetot, she suffered that the awareness she had of her kinship with the Guermantes could not be manifested outwardly in visible characters such as those who, in the mosaics of Byzantine churches, placed one below the other, inscribe in a vertical column, next to a Holy Character, the words he is supposed to pronounce. She reflected at this moment that she had never received an invitation or a visit from her young cousin the Princess of Laumes, for six years that she had been married. The thought filled her with anger, but also with pride; because, by dint of telling people who were surprised not to see her at Madame des Laumes', that it was because she would have been exposed to meeting Princess Mathilde there - which her ultra-legitimist family would not have never forgiven – she had come to believe that was indeed the reason why she was not going to her young cousin's. She remembered, however, that she had asked Mme. isn't up to me to take the first steps, I'm twenty years older than her. Thanks to the virtue of these interior words, she proudly threw back her shoulders, detached from her chest and on which her head, resting almost horizontally, made one think of the ""brought back"" head of a proud pheasant that is served on a table with all his feathers. It wasn't that she wasn't by nature squat, manly and chubby; but the snubs had straightened it like those trees which, born in a bad position on the edge of a precipice, are forced to grow backwards to keep their balance. Forced, to console herself for not being quite the equal of the other Guermantes, to tell herself constantly that it was out of intransigence of principles and pride that she saw them so little, this thought had ended up shaping her body and by giving him a kind of poise which passed in the eyes of middle-class women for a sign of race and sometimes disturbed with a fleeting desire the tired gaze of the men of the circle. If we had subjected Madame de Gallardon's conversation to these analyzes which, by noting the greater or lesser frequency of each term, make it possible to discover the key to a ciphered language, we would have realized that no expression, even the most usual, came back there as often as ""at my cousins in Guermantes"", ""at my aunt in Guermantes"", ""the health of Elzéar de Guermantes"", ""the bathtub of my cousin in Guermantes"". When someone spoke to her of an illustrious personage, she answered that, without knowing him personally, she had met him a thousand times at her aunt de Guermantes, but she answered that in such an icy tone and in a voice so muffled that 'it was clear that if she didn't know him personally, it was by virtue of all the ineradicable and stubborn principles to which her shoulders touched back, like on those ladders on which the gym teachers make you stretch to develop your thorax .","Swann had walked on into the room, at the insistence of Mme. de Saint-Euverte, and, in order to hear a melody from Orphée95 that was being performed by a flautist, had placed himself in a corner where unfortunately his only view was of two mature ladies seated next to each other, the Marquise de Cambremer and the Vicomtesse de Franquetot, who, because they were cousins, spent their time when attending a party, clutching their bags and followed by their daughters, looking for each other as though in a railway station, and did not rest easy until they had reserved, with a fan or a handkerchief, two seats side by side: Mme. de Cambremer, since she had very few acquaintances, being all the happier to have a companion, Mme. de Franquetot, who was in contrast extremely well connected, believing there was something elegant, something original, about showing all her fine friends that she preferred, to their company, an obscure lady with whom she shared memories of her youth. Full of a melancholy irony, Swann watched them listen to the piano intermezzo (Saint Francis Speaking to the Birds by Liszt)96 which had come after the flute melody, and follow the vertiginous playing of the virtuoso, Mme. de Franquetot anxiously, her eyes wild as if the keys over which he ran with such agility were a series of trapezes from which he might fall from a height of eighty yards, and at the same time casting at her neighbor looks of astonishment, of denial which signified: “This is not to be believed, I would never have thought a man could do this,” while Mme. de Cambremer, being a woman who had received a strong musical education, marked time with her head transformed into the arm of a metronome whose amplitude and rapidity of oscillations from one shoulder to the other had become such (with that sort of frenzy and abandon in the eyes characteristic of a kind of suffering which is no longer aware of itself nor tries to control itself and says “I can’t help it!”) that she kept snagging her solitaires in the straps of her bodice and was obliged to straighten the black grapes she had in her hair, though without ceasing to accelerate her motion. On the other side of Mme. de Franquetot, but a little in front, was the Marquise de Gallardon, occupied with her favorite thought, her alliance with the Guermantes, which in the eyes of the world and in her own was the source of a good deal of glory along with some shame, the most brilliant of them keeping her a bit at a distance, perhaps because she was tiresome, or because she was spiteful, or because she was from an inferior branch, or perhaps for no reason. When she found herself next to someone she did not know, as at this moment Mme. de Franquetot , it would pain her that her own awareness of her kinship with the Guermantes could not be manifested outwardly in visible characters like those which, in the mosaics of the Byzantine churches, placed one below another, inscribe in a vertical column, next to a holy personage, the words he is supposed to be uttering. At this moment she was pondering the fact that she had never received an invitation or a visit from her young cousin the Princesse des Laumes, in the six years the Princesse had been married. This thought filled her with anger, but also with pride; for, by dint of saying to people who were surprised not to see her at the home of Mme. des Laumes, that it was because she would have risked meeting Princesse Mathilde97 there—for which her ultra-Legitimist98 family would never have forgiven her—she had ended by believing this actually was the reason she did not go to her young cousin’s house. Yet she recalled having asked Mme. des Laumes several times how she might contrive to meet her, but recalled it only confusedly and also more than neutralized this slightly humiliating memory by murmuring: “After all it’s not up to me to make the first move, I’m twenty years older than she.” Fortified by the efficacy of these unspoken words, she proudly threw back her shoulders, which seemed detached from her bust and on which her head was positioned almost horizontally so that one was reminded of the “restored” head of a haughty pheasant brought to the table in all its feathers. It was not so much that she was not stocky, mannish, and plump by nature; but the insults she had received had straightened her up like those trees which, born in a bad position at the brink of a precipice, are forced to grow backward to keep their balance. Obliged as she was, in order to console herself for not being altogether the equal of the other Guermantes, to keep telling herself that it was because of the intransigence of her principles and her pride that she did not see them very often, this thought had ended by shaping her body and by giving her an imposing sort of presence that passed in the eyes of bourgeois women for a sign of breeding and sometimes disturbed with a fleeting desire the clubmen’s weary glances. If Mme. de Gallardon’s conversation had been subjected to those analyses which, by recording the greater or lesser frequency of each word, permit one to discover the key to a language in code, one would have realized that no expression, even the most ordinary, recurred in it as often as “at the home of my cousins the Guermantes,” “at the home of my aunt de Guermantes,” “the health of Elzéar de Guermantes,” “my cousin de Guermantes’s baignoire. ”99 When anyone spoke to her about a famous personage, she would answer that without knowing him personally she had met him a thousand times at the home of her aunt de Guermantes, but she would answer this in a tone so icy and in a voice so low that it was clear that, if she did not know him personally, it was by virtue of all the ineradicable and stubborn principles which her shoulders touched behind her, like those ladders on which gymnastics instructors make you stretch out in order to develop your chest.","Swann had gone forward into the room, under pressure from Mme. de Saint-Euverte and in order to listen to an aria from Orfeo which was being rendered on the flute, and had taken up a position in a corner from which, unfortunately, his horizon was bounded by two ladies of 'uncertain' age, seated side by side, the Marquise de Cambremer and the Vicomtesse de Franquetot, who, because they were cousins, used to spend their time at parties in wandering through the rooms, each clutching her bag and followed by her daughter, hunting for one another like people at a railway station, and could never be at rest until they had reserved, by marking them with their fans or handkerchiefs, two adjacent chairs; Mme. de Cambremer, since she knew scarcely anyone, being all the more glad of a companion, while Mme. de Franquetot, who, on the contrary, was extremely popular, thought it effective and original to shew all her fine friends that she preferred to their company that of an obscure country cousin with whom she had childish memories in common. Filled with ironical melancholy, Swann watched them as they listened to the pianoforte inter, mezzo (Liszt's 'Saint Francis preaching to the birds') which came after the flute, and followed the virtuoso in his dizzy flight; Mme. de Franquetot anxiously, her eyes starting from her head, as though the keys over which his fingers skipped with such agility were a series of trapezes, from any one of which he might come crashing, a hundred feet, to the ground, stealing now and then a glance of astonishment and unbelief at her companion, as who should say: ""It isn't possible, I would never have believed that a human being could do all that!"" ; Mme. de Cambremer, as a woman who had received a sound musical education, beating time with her head—transformed for the nonce into the pendulum of a metronome, the sweep and rapidity of whose movements from one shoulder to the other (performed with that look of wild abandonment in her eye which a sufferer shews who is no longer able to analyse his pain, nor anxious to master it, and says merely ""I can't help it"") so increased that at every moment her diamond earrings caught in the trimming of her bodice, and she was obliged to put straight the bunch of black grapes which she had in her hair, though without any interruption of her constantly accelerated motion. On the other side (and a little way in front) of Mme. de Franquetot, was the Marquise de Gallardon, absorbed in her favourite meditation, namely upon her own kinship with the Guermantes family, from which she derived both publicly and in private a good deal of glory no unmingled with shame, the most brilliant ornaments of that house remaining somewhat aloof from her, perhaps because she was just a tiresome old woman, or because she was a scandalous old woman, or because she came of an inferior branch of the family, or very possibly for no reason at all. When she found herself seated next to some one whom she did not know, as she was at this moment next to Mme. de Franquetot , she suffered acutely from the feeling that her own consciousness of her Guermantes connection could not be made externally manifest in visible character like those which, in the mosaics in Byzantine churches, placed one beneath another, inscribe in a vertical column by the side of some Sacred Personage the words which he is supposed to be uttering. At this moment she was pondering the fact that she had never received an invitation, or even call, from her young cousin the Princesse des Laumes, during the six years that had already elapsed since the latter's marriage. The thought filled her with anger—and with pride; for, by virtue of having told everyone who expressed surprise at never seeing her at Mme. des Laumes's, that it was because of the risk of meeting the Princesse Mathilde there—a degradation which her own family, the truest and bluest of Legitimists, would never have forgiven her, she had come gradually to believe that this actually was the reason for her not visiting her young cousin. She remembered, it is true, that she had several times inquired of Mme. des Laumes how they might contrive to meet, but she remembered it only in a confused way, and besides did more than neutralise this slightly humiliating reminiscence by murmuring, ""After all, it isn't for me to take the first step; I am at least twenty years older than she is."" And fortified by these unspoken words she flung her shoulders proudly back until they seemed to part company with her bust, while her head, which lay almost horizontally upon them, made one think of the 'stuck-on' head of a pheasant which is brought to the table regally adorned with its feathers. Not that she in the least degree resembled a pheasant, having been endowed by nature with a short and squat and masculine figure; but successive mortifications had given her a backward tilt, such as one may observe in trees which have taken root on the very edge of a precipice and are forced to grow backwards to preserve their balance. Since she was obliged, in order to console herself for not being quite on a level with the rest of the Guermantes, to repeat to herself incessantly that it was owing to the uncompromising rigidity of her principles and pride that she saw so little of them, the constant iteration had gradually remoulded her body, and had given her a sort of 'bearing' which was accepted by the plebeian as a sign of breeding, and even kindled, at times, a momentary spark in the jaded eyes of old gentlemen in clubs. Had anyone subjected Mme. de Gallardon's conversation to that form of analysis which by noting the relative frequency of its several terms would furnish him with the key to a ciphered message, he would at once have remarked that no expression, not even the commonest forms of speech, occurred in it nearly so often as ""at my cousins the Guermantes's,"" ""at my aunt Guermantes's,"" ""Elzéar de Guermantes's health,"" ""my cousin Guermantes's box. "" If anyone spoke to her of a distinguished personage, she would reply that, although she was not personally acquainted with him, she had seen him hundreds of times at her aunt Guermantes's, but she would utter this reply in so icy a tone, with such a hollow sound, that it was at once quite clear that if she did not know the celebrity personally that was because of all the obstinate, ineradicable principles against which her arching shoulders were stretched back to rest, as on one of those ladders on which gymnastic instructors make us 'extend' so as to develop the expansion of our chests."
"– Comment, vous êtes là depuis déjà un long moment !","- How, you've been here for a long time!",“What! Have you been here for a long time?”,"""What, you've been in the room quite a time?"""
"Et pourtant il était content d’être venu : le tourment qui l’avait forcé de sortir de chez lui avait perdu de son acuité en perdant de son vague, maintenant que l’autre vie d’Odette, dont il avait eu, à ce moment-là, le brusque et impuissant soupçon, il la tenait là, éclairée en plein par la lampe, prisonnière sans le savoir dans cette chambre où, quand il le voudrait, il entrerait la surprendre et la capturer ; ou plutôt il allait frapper aux volets comme il faisait souvent quand il venait très tard ; ainsi du moins, Odette apprendrait qu’il avait su, qu’il avait vu la lumière et entendu la causerie, et lui, qui tout à l’heure, se la représentait comme se riant avec l’autre de ses illusions, maintenant, c’était eux qu’il voyait, confiants dans leur erreur, trompés en somme par lui qu’ils croyaient bien loin d’ici et qui, lui, savait déjà qu’il allait frapper aux volets. Et peut-être, ce qu’il ressentait en ce moment de presque agréable, c’était autre chose aussi que l’apaisement d’un doute et d’une douleur : un plaisir de l’intelligence. Si, depuis qu’il était amoureux, les choses avaient repris pour lui un peu de l’intérêt délicieux qu’il leur trouvait autrefois, mais seulement là où elles étaient éclairées par le souvenir d’Odette, maintenant, c’était une autre faculté de sa studieuse jeunesse que sa jalousie ranimait, la passion de la vérité, mais d’une vérité, elle aussi, interposée entre lui et sa maîtresse, ne recevant sa lumière que d’elle, vérité tout individuelle qui avait pour objet unique, d’un prix infini et presque d’une beauté désintéressée, les actions d’Odette, ses relations, ses projets, son passé. À toute autre époque de sa vie, les petits faits et gestes quotidiens d’une personne avaient toujours paru sans valeur à Swann : si on lui en faisait le commérage, il le trouvait insignifiant, et, tandis qu’il l’écoutait, ce n’était que sa plus vulgaire attention qui y était intéressée ; c’était pour lui un des moments où il se sentait le plus médiocre. Mais dans cette étrange période de l’amour, l’individuel prend quelque chose de si profond, que cette curiosité qu’il sentait s’éveiller en lui à l’égard des moindres occupations d’une femme, c’était celle qu’il avait eue autrefois pour l’Histoire. Et tout ce dont il aurait eu honte jusqu’ici, espionner devant une fenêtre, qui sait ? demain peut-être, faire parler habilement les indifférents, soudoyer les domestiques, écouter aux portes, ne lui semblait plus, aussi bien que le déchiffrement des textes, la comparaison des témoignages et l’interprétation des monuments, que des méthodes d’investigation scientifique d’une véritable valeur intellectuelle et appropriées à la recherche de la vérité.","And yet he was glad to have come: the torment that had forced him out of his home had lost its sharpness as it lost its vagueness, now that Odette's other life, of which he had had, at this at that moment, the abrupt and powerless suspicion, he held her there, fully lit by the lamp, a prisoner without knowing it in this room where, when he wanted to, he would enter to surprise her and capture her; or rather he was going to knock on the shutters as he often did when he came very late; so at least Odette would learn that he had known, that he had seen the light and heard the talk, and he, who just now pictured her as laughing with the other at his illusions, now, it was them he saw, confident in their error, deceived in short by him whom they believed to be far from here and who himself already knew that he was going to knock on the shutters. And perhaps what he felt at that moment that was almost pleasant was something other than the alleviation of doubt and pain: a pleasure of intelligence. If, since he was in love, things had regained for him a little of the delicious interest he once found in them, but only where they were illuminated by the memory of Odette, now that was another thing. faculty of his studious youth which his jealousy revived, the passion for truth, but for a truth, too, interposed between him and his mistress, receiving his light only from her, a completely individual truth which had as its sole object, infinitely priceless and almost disinterestedly beautiful, Odette's actions, her relationships, her projects, her past. At any other time in his life, a person's little daily acts and deeds had always seemed worthless to Swann: if people gossiped about them, he found them insignificant, and, while he listened to him, what it was only his most vulgar attention that was interested in it; it was for him one of the moments when he felt most mediocre. But in this strange period of love, the individual takes on something so deep that this curiosity which he felt awakening in him with regard to the least occupations of a woman, was that which he had once had for History. And everything he would have been ashamed of until now, spying outside a window, who knows? tomorrow perhaps, to make the indifferent speak skilfully, to bribe the servants, to eavesdrop, no longer seemed to him, as much as the deciphering of texts, the comparison of testimonies and the interpretation of monuments, as methods of scientific investigation of real intellectual value and appropriate to the search for truth.","And yet he was glad he had come: the torment that had forced him to leave his house had become less acute as it became less vague, now that Odette’s other life, of which he had had, back then, a sudden helpless suspicion, was now in his grasp, fully illuminated by the lamp, an unwitting prisoner in that room into which, when he chose, he could go to surprise it and capture it; or rather he would knock on the shutters as he often did when he came very late; this way at least, Odette would learn that he knew, that he had seen the light and heard the talking, and that, after having just a moment ago pictured her laughing with the other man at his illusions, he would now be the one to see them, confident in their error, actually outwitted by him whom they believed to be so very far away and who, in fact, already knew he was going to knock at the shutters. And perhaps, what he was feeling at this moment, which was almost pleasant, was also something different from the assuaging of a doubt and a distress: it was a pleasure in knowledge. If, ever since he had fallen in love, things had regained for him a little of the delightful interest they had once had for him, but only insofar as they were illuminated by the memory of Odette, now it was another of the faculties of his studious youth that his jealousy revived, a passion for truth, but for a truth that was likewise interposed between him and his mistress, taking its light only from her, a completely individual truth whose sole object, of an infinite value and almost disinterested in its beauty, was Odette’s actions, her relationships, her plans, her past. At all other periods of his life, the little everyday words and deeds of a person had always seemed worthless to Swann if someone conveyed them to him as the subject of a bit of gossip, he found such gossip meaningless, and, while he listened to it, only the most vulgar part of his attention was interested; these were the times when he felt himself to be most mediocre. But in this strange phase of love, an individual person assumes something so profound that the curiosity he now felt awakening in him concerning the smallest occupations of this woman, was the same curiosity he had once had about History. And all these things that would have shamed him up to now, such as spying, tonight, outside a window, tomorrow perhaps, for all he knew, cleverly inducing neutral people to speak, bribing servants, listening at doors, now seemed to him to be, fully as much as were the deciphering of texts, the weighing of evidence, and the interpretation of old monuments, merely methods of scientific investigation with a real intellectual value and appropriate to a search for the truth.","And yet he was not sorry that he had come; the torment which had forced him to leave his own house had lost its sharpness when it lost its uncertainty, now that Odette's other life, of which he had had, at that first moment, a sudden helpless suspicion, was definitely there, almost within his grasp, before his eyes, in the full glare of the lamp-light, caught and kept there, an unwitting prisoner, in that room into which, when he would, he might force his way to surprise and seize it; or rather he would tap upon the shutters, as he had often done when he had come there very late, and by that signal Odette would at least learn that he knew, that he had seen the light and had heard the voices; while he himself, who a moment ago had been picturing her as laughing at him, as sharing with that other the knowledge of how effectively he had been tricked, now it was he that saw them, confident and persistent in their error, tricked and trapped by none other than himself, whom they believed to be a mile away, but who was there, in person, there with a plan, there with the knowledge that he was going, in another minute, to tap upon the shutter. And, perhaps, what he felt (almost an agreeable feeling) at that moment was something more than relief at the solution of a doubt, at the soothing of a pain; was an intellectual pleasure. If, since he had fallen in love, things had recovered a little of the delicate attraction that they had had for him long ago—though only when a light was shed upon them by a thought, a memory of Odette—now it was another of the faculties, prominent in the studious days of his youth, that Odette had quickened with new life, the passion for truth, but for a truth which, too, was interposed between himself and his mistress, receiving its light from her alone, a private and personal truth the sole object of which (an infinitely precious object, and one almost impersonal in its absolute beauty) was Odette—Odette in her activities, her environment, her projects, and her past. At every other period in his life, the little everyday words and actions of another person had always seemed wholly valueless to Swann; if gossip about such things were repeated to him, he would dismiss it as insignificant, and while he listened it was only the lowest, the most commonplace part of his mind that was interested; at such moments he felt utterly dull and uninspired. But in this strange phase of love the personality of another person becomes so enlarged, so deepened, that the curiosity which he could now feel aroused in himself, to know the least details of a woman's daily occupation, was the same thirst for knowledge with which he had once studied history. And all manner of actions, from which, until now, he would have recoiled in shame, such as spying, to-night, outside a window, to-morrow, for all he knew, putting adroitly provocative questions to casual witnesses, bribing servants, listening at doors, seemed to him, now, to be precisely on a level with the deciphering of manuscripts, the weighing of evidence, the interpretation of old monuments, that was to say, so many different methods of scientific investigation, each one having a definite intellectual value and being legitimately employable in the search for truth."
"que Swann aurait voulu pouvoir dire que l’histoire était vraie et délicieuse.

The doctor, who had been listening to them, thought this was the moment to say: Se non è vero,62 but he was not quite sure of the words and was afraid of getting muddled.","He surrendered so quickly, looked so wretched at the sight of his castle in ruins, and replied in so craven a tone to Swann, appealing to him not to persist in a refutation which was already superfluous, ""All right; all right; anyhow, even if I have made a mistake that's not a crime, I hope,"" that Swann longed to be able to console him by insisting that the story was indubitably true and exquisitely funny. The Doctor, who had been listening, had an idea that it was the right moment to interject ""Se non è vero,"" but he was not quite certain of the words, and was afraid of being caught out."
"Mais aussi, parce qu’il n’avait pas de principes (dans le sens de ma grand’mère), il n’avait pas à proprement parler d’intransigeance. Il me regarda un instant d’un air étonné et fâché, puis dès que maman lui eut expliqué en quelques mots embarrassés ce qui était arrivé, il lui dit : « Mais va donc avec lui, puisque tu disais justement que tu n’as pas envie de dormir, reste un peu dans sa chambre, moi je n’ai besoin de rien. » – « Mais, mon ami, répondit timidement ma mère, que j’aie envie ou non de dormir, ne change rien à la chose, on ne peut pas habituer cet enfant… » – « Mais il ne s’agit pas d’habituer, dit mon père en haussant les épaules, tu vois bien que ce petit a du chagrin, il a l’air désolé, cet enfant ; voyons, nous ne sommes pas des bourreaux ! Quand tu l’auras rendu malade, tu seras bien avancée ! Puisqu’il y a deux lits dans sa chambre, dis donc à Françoise de te préparer le grand lit et couche pour cette nuit auprès de lui. Allons, bonsoir, moi qui ne suis pas si nerveux que vous, je vais me coucher. »","But also, because he had no principles (in my grandmother's sense), he had no intransigence, strictly speaking. He looked at me for a moment with a surprised and angry air, then as soon as Mama had explained to him in a few embarrassed words what had happened, he said to her: ""But go with him, since you were just saying that you didn't want to sleep, stay a little in his room, I don't need anything. – “But, my friend, replied my mother timidly, whether I want to sleep or not, does not change the thing, we cannot accustom this child…” – “But it is not a question of get used to it, said my father, shrugging his shoulders, you can see that this little one is upset, he looks sorry, this child; see, we are not executioners! When you have made him sick, you will be well on your way! Since there are two beds in his room, tell Françoise to prepare the big bed for you and sleep with him for the night. Come on, good evening, I, who am not as nervous as you, am going to bed. »","But also, because he had no principles (in my grandmother’s sense), he was not strictly speaking intransigent. He looked at me for a moment with an expression of surprise and annoyance, then as soon as Mama had explained to him with a few embarrassed words what had happened, he said to her: “Go along with him, then. You were just saying you didn’t feel very sleepy, stay in his room for a little while, I don’t need anything.” “But my dear,” answered my mother timidly, “whether I’m sleepy or not doesn’t change anything, we can’t let the child get into the habit . . .” “But it isn’t a question of habit,” said my father, shrugging his shoulders, “you can see the boy is upset, he seems very sad; look, we’re not executioners! You’ll end by making him ill, and that won’t do us much good! There are two beds in his room; go tell Françoise to prepare the big one for you and sleep there with him tonight. Now then, goodnight, I’m not as high-strung as the two of you , I’m going to bed.”","But then again, simply because he was devoid of principles (in my grandmother's sense), so he could not, properly speaking, be called inexorable. He looked at me for a moment with an air of annoyance and surprise, and then when Mamma had told him, not without some embarrassment, what had happened, said to her: ""Go along with him, then; you said just now that you didn't feel like sleep, so stay in his room for a little. I don't need anything."" ""But dear,"" my mother answered timidly, ""whether or not I feel like sleep is not the point; we must not make the child accustomed..."" ""There's no question of making him accustomed,"" said my father, with a shrug of the shoulders; ""you can see quite well that the child is unhappy. After all, we aren't gaolers. You'll end by making him ill, and a lot of good that will do. There are two beds in his room; tell Françoise to make up the big one for you, and stay beside him for the rest of the night. I'm off to bed, anyhow; I'm not nervous like you. Good night."""
"MmeVerdurin s’immobilisa, prit une expression inerte comme si elle était devenue une statue, fiction qui lui permit d’être censée ne pas avoir entendu ce mot insupportable de poseur qui avait l’air d’impliquer qu’on pouvait « poser » avec eux, donc qu’on était « plus qu’eux ».","Madame Verdurin froze, took on an inert expression as if she had become a statue, a fiction which allowed her to be supposed not to have heard that unbearable word poseur which seemed to imply that one could ""pose"" with them, so that we were ""more than them"".","Verdurin froze, assumed an inert expression as if she had turned into a statue, a fiction that allowed it to be assumed that she had not heard that intolerable word affected, which seemed to imply that one could “be affected” with them, therefore that one was “better than them.”","Verdurin's whole body stiffened, her eyes stared blankly as though she had suddenly been turned into a statue; a device by means of which she might be supposed not to have caught the sound of that unutterable word which seemed to imply that it was possible for people to 'pose' in her house, and, therefore, that there were people in the world who 'mattered more' than herself."

"C’était chez la marquise de Saint-Euverte, à la dernière, pour cette année-là, des soirées où elle faisait entendre des artistes qui lui servaient ensuite pour ses concerts de charité. Swann, qui avait voulu successivement aller à toutes les précédentes et n’avait pu s’y résoudre avait reçu, tandis qu’il s’habillait pour se rendre à celle-ci, la visite du baron de Charlus qui venait lui offrir de retourner avec lui chez la marquise, si sa compagnie devait l’aider à s’y ennuyer un peu moins, à s’y trouver moins triste.

Vous savez l’excellente influence que vous avez sur elle. Je crois qu’elle ne sort pas ce soir avant d’aller chez son ancienne couturière où, du reste, elle sera sûrement contente que vous l’accompagniez. En tous cas vous la trouveriez chez elle avant. Tâchez de la distraire et aussi de lui parler raison. Si vous pouviez arranger quelque chose pour demain qui lui plaise et que nous pourrions faire tous les trois ensemble.","It was at the Marquise de Saint-Euverte's, at the last, for that year, of the evenings at which she gave performances to artists who were then used for her charity concerts. Swann, who had successively wanted to go to all the previous ones and had been unable to make up his mind to do so, had received, while he was getting dressed to go to this one, a visit from the Baron de Charlus who had come to offer him a return trip. with him at the marquise's, if his company should help him to be a little less bored there, to be less sad. But Swann had replied: “You have no doubt of the pleasure I would have in being with you. But the greatest pleasure you can give me is to go and see Odette instead. You know the excellent influence you have on her. I don't think she's going out this evening before going to her old seamstress's where, moreover, she will surely be happy that you accompany her.

"Il y a dans le violon – si, ne voyant pas l’instrument, on ne peut pas rapporter ce qu’on entend à son image, laquelle modifie la sonorité – des accents qui lui sont si communs avec certaines voix de contralto, qu’on a l’illusion qu’une chanteuse s’est ajoutée au concert. On lève les yeux, on ne voit que les étuis, précieux comme des boîtes chinoises, mais, par moments, on est encore trompé par l’appel décevant de la sirène ; parfois aussi on croit entendre un génie captif qui se débat au fond de la docte boîte, ensorcelée et frémissante, comme un diable dans un bénitier ; parfois enfin, c’est dans l’air comme un être surnaturel et pur qui passe en déroulant son message invisible.","There are in the violin – if, not seeing the instrument, one cannot relate what one hears to its image, which modifies the sonority – accents which are so common to it with certain contralto voices, that we have the illusion that a singer has joined the concert. We look up, we see only the cases, precious as Chinese boxes, but, at times, we are still deceived by the disappointing call of the siren; sometimes, too, you think you hear a captive genius struggling at the bottom of the learned box, bewitched and quivering, like a devil in a stoup; sometimes finally, it is in the air like a supernatural and pure being which passes by unrolling its invisible message.","There are tones in a violin—if we cannot see the instrument and therefore cannot relate what we hear to our image of it, which changes the sound of it—so similar to those of certain contralto voices that we have the illusion a singer has been added to the concert. We lift our eyes, we see only the bodies of the instruments, as precious as Chinese boxes, but at times we are still fooled by the deceptive call of the siren; at times too we think we hear a captive genie struggling deep inside the intelligent, bewitched, and tremulous box, like a devil in a holy-water basin; sometimes, again it is like a pure and supernatural being that passes through the air uncoiling its invisible message.","There are in the music of the violin—if one does not see the instrument itself, and so cannot relate what one hears to its form, which modifies the fullness of the sound—accents which are so closely akin to those of certain contralto voices, that one has the illusion that a singer has taken her place amid the orchestra. One raises one's eyes; one sees only the wooden case, magical as a Chinese box; but, at moments, one is still tricked by the deceiving appeal of the Siren; at times, too, one believes that one is listening to a captive spirit, struggling in the darkness of its masterful box, a box quivering with enchantment, like a devil immersed in a stoup of holy water; sometimes, again, it is in the air, at large, like a pure and supernatural creature that reveals to the ear, as it passes, its invisible message."

At these words I rose to a kind of ecstasy; what I had thought impossible until then, I really felt myself penetrating between these ""rocks of amethyst like a reef in the Indian Sea""; by a supreme gymnastics and beyond my strength, stripping myself as of an objectless carapace of the air of my room, which surrounded me, I replaced it by equal parts of Venetian air, this marine atmosphere, inexpressible and particular like that of the dreams that my imagination had enclosed in the name of Venice, I felt a miraculous disembodiment taking place within me; it was immediately coupled with the vague desire to vomit which one feels when one has just had a severe sore throat, and they had to put me to bed with such a tenacious fever that the doctor declared that it was necessary to give up not only let me go now to Florence and Venice but, even when I should be fully recovered, avoid me, for at least a year from now, any travel plans and any cause of agitation.","But I was still merely on the way to the last degree of bliss; I reached it finally (for only then did the revelation come to me that on those wave-splashed streets, reddened by reflections from Giorgione’s frescoes,12 it was not, as I had, despite so many admonitions, continued to imagine, men “majestic and terrible as the sea, bearing armour that gleamed with bronze beneath the folds of their blood-red cloaks”13 who would be walking through Venice next week, on the eve of Easter, but that I myself might be the minuscule figure, in a large photograph of St. Mark’s that had been lent to me, whom the illustrator represented, in a bowler hat, in front of the porches), when I heard my father say: “It must be quite cold, still, on the Grand Canal; you would do well to put your winter overcoat and your heavy jacket in your trunk just in case.” At these words I was lifted into a kind of ecstasy; I felt myself to be truly making my way, as I had until then thought impossible, between those “rocks of amethyst like a reef in the Indian Ocean”;14 by a supreme feat of gymnastics beyond my strength, divesting myself, as of a useless carapace, of the air of my bedroom that surrounded me, I replaced it by equal parts of Venetian air, that marine atmosphere as indescribable and particular as the atmosphere of dreams, which my imagination had enclosed in the name of Venice; I felt myself undergoing a miraculous disincarnation; it was immediately accompanied by that vague desire to vomit which one feels when one has come down with a severe sore throat, and they had to put me to bed with a fever so tenacious that the doctor declared they would not only have to give up the idea of allowing me to leave for Florence and Venice now but, even when I was entirely well again, spare me for at least a year any plans for traveling and any cause of excitement.","But I was still on the way, only, to the supreme pinnacle of happiness; I reached it finally (for not until then did the revelation burst upon me that on the clattering streets, reddened by the light reflected from Giorgione's frescoes, it was not, as I had, despite so many promptings, continued to imagine, the men ""majestic and terrible as the sea, bearing armour that gleamed with bronze beneath the folds of their blood-red cloaks,"" who would be walking in Venice next week, on the Easter vigil; but that I myself might be the minute personage whom, in an enlarged photograph of St. Mark's that had been lent to me, the operator had portrayed, in a bowler hat, in front of the portico), when I heard my father say: ""It must be pretty cold, still, on the Grand Canal; whatever you do, don't forget to pack your winter greatcoat and your thick suit. "" At these words I was raised to a sort of ecstasy; a thing that I had until then deemed impossible, I felt myself to be penetrating indeed between those ""rocks of amethyst, like a reef in the Indian Ocean""; by a supreme muscular effort, a long way in excess of my real strength, stripping myself, as of a shell that served no purpose, of the air in my own room which surrounded me, I replaced it by an equal quantity of Venetian air, that marine atmosphere, indescribable and peculiar as the atmosphere of the dreams which my imagination had secreted in the name of Venice; I could feel at work within me a miraculous disincarnation; it was at once accompanied by that vague desire to vomit which one feels when one has a very sore throat; and they had to put me to bed with a fever so persistent that the doctor not only assured my parents that a visit, that spring, to Florence and Venice was absolutely out of the question, but warned their that, even when I should have completely recovered, I must, for at least a year, give up all idea of travelling, and be kept from anything that wa; liable to excite me."
"Ce qui avait besoin de bouger, quelque feuillage de marronnier, bougeait. Mais son frissonnement minutieux, total, exécuté jusque dans ses moindres nuances et ses dernières délicatesses, ne bavait pas sur le reste, ne se fondait pas avec lui, restait circonscrit.","What needed to move, some chestnut leaves, moved.

"Longtemps, je me suis couché de bonne heure. Parfois, à peine ma bougie éteinte, mes yeux se fermaient si vite que je n’avais pas le temps de me dire : « Je m’endors. » Et, une demi-heure après, la pensée qu’il était temps de chercher le sommeil m’éveillait ; je voulais poser le volume que je croyais avoir dans les mains et souffler ma lumière ; je n’avais pas cessé en dormant de faire des réflexions sur ce que je venais de lire, mais ces réflexions avaient pris un tour un peu particulier ; il me semblait que j’étais moi-même ce dont parlait l’ouvrage : une église, un quatuor, la rivalité de François Ier et de Charles-Quint. Cette croyance survivait pendant quelques secondes à mon réveil ; elle ne choquait pas ma raison, mais pesait comme des écailles sur mes yeux et les empêchait de se rendre compte que le bougeoir n’était plus allumé. Puis elle commençait à me devenir inintelligible, comme après la métempsycose les pensées d’une existence antérieure ; le sujet du livre se détachait de moi, j’étais libre de m’y appliquer ou non ; aussitôt je recouvrais la vue et j’étais bien étonné de trouver autour de moi une obscurité, douce et reposante pour mes yeux, mais peut-être plus encore pour mon esprit, à qui elle apparaissait comme une chose sans cause, incompréhensible, comme une chose vraiment obscure. Je me demandais quelle heure il pouvait être ; j’entendais le sifflement des trains qui, plus ou moins éloigné, comme le chant d’un oiseau dans une forêt, relevant les distances, me décrivait l’étendue de la campagne déserte où le voyageur se hâte vers la station prochaine ; et le petit chemin qu’il suit va être gravé dans son souvenir par l’excitation qu’il doit à des lieux nouveaux, à des actes inaccoutumés, à la causerie récente et aux adieux sous la lampe étrangère qui le suivent encore dans le silence de la nuit, à la douceur prochaine du retour.","For a long time, I went to bed early. Sometimes, as soon as my candle was extinguished, my eyes closed so quickly that I had no time to say to myself: ""I'm falling asleep. And half an hour later the thought that it was time to go to sleep woke me up; I wanted to put down the volume I thought I had in my hands and blow out my light; I had not stopped while sleeping to make reflections on what I had just read, but these reflections had taken a rather particular turn; it seemed to me that I myself was what the book was about: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between Francis I and Charles V. This belief survived for a few seconds after I woke up; it did not shock my reason, but weighed like scales on my eyes and prevented them from realizing that the candlestick was no longer lit. Then it began to become unintelligible to me, as after metempsychosis the thoughts of a previous existence; the subject of the book was detached from me, I was free to apply myself to it or not; immediately I recovered my sight and I was very surprised to find a darkness around me, soft and restful for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind, to which it appeared as a thing without cause, incomprehensible, like a really obscure thing. I wondered what time it could be; I heard the whistle of the trains which, more or less distant, like the song of a bird in a forest, noting the distances, described to me the extent of the deserted countryside where the traveler hastens towards the next station; and the little path he follows will be engraved in his memory by the excitement he owes to new places, to unaccustomed acts, to the recent talk and to the farewells under the foreign lamp which still follow him in silence. of the night, to the approaching sweetness of the return.","FOR A LONG TIME, I went to bed early. Sometimes, my candle scarcely out, my eyes would close so quickly that I did not have time to say to myself: “I’m falling asleep.” And, half an hour later, the thought that it was time to try to sleep would wake me; I wanted to put down the book I thought I still had in my hands and blow out my light; I had not ceased while sleeping to form reflections on what I had just read, but these reflections had taken a rather peculiar turn; it seemed to me that I myself was what the book was talking about: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between François I and Charles V. This belief lived on for a few seconds after my waking; it did not shock my reason but lay heavy like scales on my eyes and kept them from realizing that the candlestick was no longer lit. Then it began to grow unintelligible to me, as after metempsychosis do the thoughts of an earlier existence; the subject of the book detached itself from me, I was free to apply myself to it or not; immediately I recovered my sight and I was amazed to find a darkness around me soft and restful for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind, to which it appeared a thing without cause, incomprehensible, a thing truly dark. I would ask myself what time it might be; I could hear the whistling of the trains which, remote or nearby, like the singing of a bird in a forest, plotting the distances, described to me the extent of the deserted countryside where the traveler hastens toward the nearest station; and the little road he is following will be engraved on his memory by the excitement he owes to new places, to unaccustomed activities, to the recent conversation and the farewells under the unfamiliar lamp that follow him still through the silence of the night, to the imminent sweetness of his return.","For a long time I used to go to bed early. Sometimes, when I had put out my candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to say ""I'm going to sleep.

This impression would persist for some moments after I was awake; it did not disturb my mind, but it lay like scales upon my eyes and prevented them from registering the fact that the candle was no longer burning. Then it would begin to seem unintelligible, as the thoughts of a former existence must be to a reincarnate spirit; the subject of my book would separate itself from me, leaving me free to choose whether I would form part of it or no; and at the same time my sight would return and I would be astonished to find myself in a state of darkness, pleasant and restful enough for the eyes, and even more, perhaps, for my mind, to which it appeared incomprehensible, without a cause, a matter dark indeed. I would ask myself what o'clock it could be; I could hear the whistling of trains, which, now nearer and now farther off, punctuating the distance like the note of a bird in a forest, shewed me in perspective the deserted countryside through which a traveller would be hurrying towards the nearest station: the path that he followed being fixed for ever in his memory by the general excitement due to being in a strange place, to doing unusual things, to the last words of conversation, to farewells exchanged beneath an unfamiliar lamp which echoed still in his ears amid the silence of the night; and to the delightful prospect of being once again at home."

"Non ; de même que ce qu’il me fallait pour que je pusse m’endormir heureux, avec cette paix sans trouble qu’aucune maîtresse n’a pu me donner depuis, puisqu’on doute d’elles encore au moment où on croit en elles et qu’on ne possède jamais leur cœur comme je recevais dans un baiser celui de ma mère, tout entier, sans la réserve d’une arrère-pensée, sans le reliquat d’une intention qui ne fût pas pour moi – c’est que ce fût elle, c’est qu’elle inclinât vers moi ce visage où il y avait au-dessous de l’œil quelque chose qui était, paraît-il, un défaut, et que j’aimais à l’égal du reste ; de même ce que je veux revoir, c’est le côté de Guermantes que j’ai connu, avec la ferme qui est peu éloignée des deux suivantes serrées l’une contre l’autre, à l’entrée de l’allée des chênes ; ce sont ces prairies où, quand le soleil les rend réfléchissantes comme une mare, se dessinent les feuilles des pommiers, c’est ce paysage dont parfois, la nuit dans mes rêves, l’individualité m’étreint avec une puissance presque fantastique et que je ne peux plus retrouver au réveil. Sans doute pour avoir à jamais indissolublement uni en moi des impressions différentes, rien que parce qu’ils me les avaient fait éprouver en même temps, le côté de Méséglise ou le côté de Guermantes m’ont exposé, pour l’avenir, à bien des déceptions et même à bien des fautes. Car souvent j’ai voulu revoir une personne sans discerner que c’était simplement parce qu’elle me rappelait une haie d’aubépines, et j’ai été induit à croire, à faire croire à un regain d’affection, par un simple désir de voyage. Mais par là même aussi, et en restant présents en celles de mes impressions d’aujourd’hui auxquelles ils peuvent se relier, ils leur donnent des assises, de la profondeur, une dimension de plus qu’aux autres.","No ; as well as what I needed so that I could go to sleep happy, with this untroubled peace that no mistress has been able to give me since, since we still doubt them at the moment when we believe in them. and that one never possesses their heart as I received my mother's heart in a kiss, entirely, without the reserve of an ulterior motive, without the residue of an intention which was not for me - it is that it was her, it was because she tilted towards me that face where there was something below the eye which was, it seems, a defect, and which I loved as much as the rest ; likewise what I want to see again is the side of Guermantes that I knew, with the farm which is not far from the next two close together, at the entrance to the alley of oaks ; it is these meadows where, when the sun makes them reflective like a pond, the leaves of the apple trees take shape, it is this landscape whose individuality sometimes, at night in my dreams, embraces me with an almost fantastic power and that I can't find it when I wake up. Doubtless for having forever indissolubly united in me different impressions, just because they had made me experience them at the same time, the side of Méséglise or the side of Guermantes exposed me, for the future, to many disappointments and even many faults. Because often I wanted to see a person again without discerning that it was simply because he reminded me of a hawthorn hedge, and I was induced to believe, to make believe in a renewal of affection, by a simple desire to travel. But thereby also, and by remaining present in those of my impressions of today to which they can relate, they give them foundations, depth, one more dimension than the others.","No; just as what I needed so that I could go to sleep happy, with that untroubled peace which no mistress has been able to give me since that time because one doubts them even at the moment one believes in them, and can never possess their hearts as I received in a kiss my mother’s heart, complete, without the reservation of an afterthought, without the residue of an intention that was not for me—was that it should be her, that she should incline over me that face marked below the eye by something which was, it seems, a blemish, and which I loved as much as the rest, so what I want to see again is the Guermantes way that I knew, with the farm that is not very far from the two that come after pressed so close together, at the entrance to the avenue of oaks; those meadows on which, when the sun turns them reflective as a pond, the leaves of the apple trees are sketched, that landscape whose individuality sometimes, at night in my dreams, clasps me with an almost uncanny power and which I can no longer recover when I wake up. No doubt, by virtue of having forever indissolubly united in me different impressions merely because they had made me experience them at the same time, the Méséglise way and the Guermantes way exposed me, for the future, to many disappointments and even to many mistakes. For often I have wanted to see a person again without discerning that it was simply because she reminded me of a hedge of hawthorns, and I have been led to believe, to make someone else believe, in a revival of affection, by what was simply a desire to travel. But because of that very fact, too, and by persisting in those of my impressions of today to which they may be connected, they give them foundations, depth, a dimension lacking from the others.","No: just as the one thing necessary to send me to sleep contented (in that untroubled peace which no mistress, in later years, has ever been able to give me, since one has doubts of them at the moment when one believes in them, and never can possess their hearts as I used to receive, in her kiss, the heart of my mother, complete, without scruple or reservation, unburdened by any liability save to myself) was that it should be my mother who came, that she should incline towards me that face on which there was, beneath her eye, something that was, it appears, a blemish, and which I loved as much as all the rest—so what I want to see again is the 'Guermantes way' as I knew it, with the farm that stood a little apart from the two neighbouring farms, pressed so close together, at the entrance to the oak avenue; those meadows upon whose surface, when it is polished by the sun to the mirroring radiance of a lake, are outlined the leaves of the apple-trees; that whole landscape whose individuality sometimes, at night, in my dreams, binds me with a power that is almost fantastic, of which I can discover no trace when I awake. No doubt, by virtue of having permanently and indissolubly combined in me groups of different impressions, for no reason save that they had made me feel several separate things at the same time , the Méséglise and Guermantes 'ways' left me exposed, in later life, to much disillusionment, and even to many mistakes. For often I have wished to see a person again without realising that it was simply because that person recalled to me a hedge of hawthorns in blossom; and I have been led to believe, and to make some one else believe in an aftermath of affection, by what was no more than an inclination to travel. But by the same qualities, and by their persistence in those of my impressions, to-day, to which they can find an attachment, the two 'ways' give to those impressions a foundation, depth, a dimension lacking from the rest."

"Même quand il ne pouvait savoir où elle était allée, il lui aurait suffi pour calmer l’angoisse qu’il éprouvait alors, et contre laquelle la présence d’Odette, la douceur d’être auprès d’elle était le seul spécifique (un spécifique qui à la longue aggravait le mal avec bien des remèdes, mais du moins calmait momentanément la souffrance), il lui aurait suffi, si Odette l’avait seulement permis, de rester chez elle tant qu’elle ne serait pas là, de l’attendre jusqu’à cette heure du retour dans l’apaisement de laquelle seraient venues se confondre les heures qu’un prestige, un maléfice lui avaient fait croire différentes des autres. Mais elle ne le voulait pas ; il revenait chez lui ; il se forçait en chemin à former divers projets, il cessait de songer à Odette ; même il arrivait, tout en se déshabillant, à rouler en lui des pensées assez joyeuses ; c’est le cœur plein de l’espoir d’aller le lendemain voir quelque chef-d’œuvre qu’il se mettait au lit et éteignait sa lumière ; mais, dès que, pour se préparer à dormir, il cessait d’exercer sur lui-même une contrainte dont il n’avait même pas conscience tant elle était devenue habituelle, au même instant un frisson glacé refluait en lui et il se mettait à sangloter. Il ne voulait même pas savoir pourquoi, s’essuyait les yeux, se disait en riant : « C’est charmant, je deviens névropathe. » Puis il ne pouvait penser sans une grande lassitude que le lendemain il faudrait recommencer de chercher à savoir ce qu’Odette avait fait, à mettre en jeu des influences pour tâcher de la voir. Cette nécessité d’une activité sans trêve, sans variété, sans résultats, lui était si cruelle qu’un jour, apercevant une grosseur sur son ventre, il ressentit une véritable joie à la pensée qu’il avait peut-être une tumeur mortelle, qu’il n’allait plus avoir à s’occuper de rien, que c’était la maladie qui allait le gouverner, faire de lui son jouet, jusqu’à la fin prochaine. Et en effet si, à cette époque, il lui arriva souvent sans se l’avouer de désirer la mort, c’était pour échapper moins à l’acuité de ses souffrances qu’à la monotonie de son effort.","Even when he couldn't know where she had gone, it would have been enough for him to calm the anguish he felt then, and against which the presence of Odette, the sweetness of being near her was the only specific (a which in the long run aggravated the evil with many remedies, but at least temporarily calmed the suffering), it would have sufficed for her, if Odette had only allowed it, to stay at home as long as she was not there, to to wait until that hour of return in the appeasement of which would have come to merge the hours that a charm, a spell had made him believe different from the others. But she didn't want it; he was returning home; he forced himself on the way to form various projects, he ceased to think of Odette; he even managed, while undressing, to stir up rather joyous thoughts within him; it was with his heart full of the hope of going the next day to see some masterpiece that he would put himself in bed and put out his light; but as soon as, in order to prepare for sleep, he ceased to exert on himself a constraint of which he was not even aware so much had it sob. He didn't even want to know why, wiped his eyes, said to himself laughing: ""It's charming, I'm becoming a neuropath."" Then he could not think without great weariness that the next day he would have to begin again to try to find out what Odette had done, to bring influences into play in order to try to see her. This need for ceaseless activity, without variety, without results, was so cruel to him that one day, seeing a growth on his belly, he felt a real joy at the thought that he had perhaps a mortal tumor, that he wasn't going to have to worry about anything anymore, that it was illness that was going to rule him, make him his plaything, until the near end. And indeed if, at that time, it often happened to him without acknowledging it to desire death, it was to escape less from the acuteness of his sufferings than from the monotony of his effort.","Even when he could not find out where she had gone, it would have been enough to soothe the anguish which he felt at these times, and for which Odette’s presence, the sweetness of being close to her was the only specific (a specific that in the long run aggravated the disease, like many remedies, but at least momentarily soothed his pain), it would have been enough for him, if only Odette had permitted it, to remain in her house while she was out, to wait for her there until the hour of her return, into whose stillness and appeasement would have flowed and melted the hours which some magical illusion, some evil spell had made him believe were different from the rest. But she did not want this; he returned home; he forced himself, on the way, to make various plans, he stopped thinking about Odette; he even succeeded, while he was undressing, in turning over some fairly cheerful thoughts in his mind; and it was with a light heart, full of the hope of going to see some great painting the next day, that he got into bed and put out his light; but, no sooner, as he prepared to go to sleep, did he cease to exert upon himself a constraint of which he was not even aware because it was by now so habitual, than at that very instant an icy shiver would run through him and he would begin to sob. He did not even want to know why, dried his eyes, said to himself with a smile: “Delightful—I’m turning into a real neurotic.” Then he could not think without a feeling of great weariness that the next day he would again have to begin trying to find out what Odette had been doing, use all his influence to attempt to see her. This compulsion to an activity without respite, without variety, without results was so cruel to him that one day, seeing a lump on his abdomen, he felt real joy at the thought that he might have a fatal tumor, that he was no longer going to have to take charge of anything, that it was the disease that would manage him, make him its plaything, until the impending end. And indeed if, during this period, he often desired death though without admitting it to himself, it was to escape not so much the acuteness of his sufferings as the monotony of his struggle.","Even when he could not discover where she had gone, it would have sufficed to alleviate the anguish that he then felt, for which Odette's presence, the charm of her company, was the sole specific (a specific which in the long run served, like many other remedies, to aggravate the disease, but at least brought temporary relief to his sufferings), it would have sufficed, had Odette only permitted him to remain in her house while she was out, to wait there until that hour of her return, into whose stillness and peace would flow, to be mingled and lost there, all memory of those intervening hours which some sorcery, some cursed spell had made him imagine as, somehow, different from the rest. But she would not; he must return home; he forced himself, on the way, to form various plans, ceased to think of Odette; he even reached the stage, while he undressed, of turning over all sorts of happy ideas in his mind: it was with a light heart, buoyed with the anticipation of going to see some favourite work of art on the morrow, that he jumped into bed and turned out the light; but no sooner had he made himself ready to sleep, relaxing a self-control of which he was not even conscious, so habitual had it become, than an icy shudder convulsed his body and he burst into sobs. He did not wish to know why, but dried his eyes, saying with a smile: "" This is delightful; I'm becoming neurasthenic."" After which he could not save himself from utter exhaustion at the thought that, next day, he must begin afresh his attempt to find out what Odette had been doing, must use all his influence to contrive to see her. This compulsion to an activity without respite, without variety, without result, was so cruel a scourge that one day, noticing a swelling over his stomach, he felt an actual joy in the idea that he had, perhaps, a tumour which would prove fatal, that he need not concern himself with anything further, that it was his malady which was going to govern his life, to make a plaything of him, until the not-distant end. If indeed, at this period, it often happened that, though without admitting it even to himself, he longed for death , it was in order to escape not so much from the keenness of his sufferings as from the monotony of his struggle."

"Ainsi passa près de moi ce nom de Gilberte, donné comme un talisman qui me permettait peut-être de retrouver un jour celle dont il venait de faire une personne et qui, l’instant d’avant, n’était qu’une image incertaine. Ainsi passa-t-il, proféré au-dessus des jasmins et des giroflées, aigre et frais comme les gouttes de l’arrosoir vert ; imprégnant, irisant la zone d’air pur qu’il avait traversée – et qu’il isolait – du mystère de la vie de celle qu’il désignait pour les êtres heureux qui vivaient, qui voyageaient avec elle ; déployant sous l’épinier rose, à hauteur de mon épaule, la quintessence de leur familiarité, pour moi si douloureuse, avec elle, avec l’inconnu de sa vie où je n’entrerais pas.","Thus passed close to me the name of Gilberte, given as a talisman which perhaps allowed me to rediscover one day the one of whom he had just made a person and who, the moment before, was only an uncertain image. . Thus it passed, uttered above the jasmines and the wallflowers, sour and fresh as the drops of the green watering-can; impregnating, iridescent the zone of pure air that he had crossed – and that he isolated – with the mystery of the life of the one he designated for the happy beings who lived, who traveled with her; unfolding under the pink thornbush, at the level of my shoulder, the quintessence of their familiarity, for me so painful, with her, with the unknown of her life into which I would not enter.","So it was that this name, Gilberte, passed by close to me, given like a talisman that might one day enable me to find this girl again whom it had just turned into a person and who, a moment before, had been merely an uncertain image. Thus it passed, spoken over the jasmines and the stocks, as sour and as cool as the drops from the green watering hose; impregnating, coloring the portion of pure air that it had crossed—and that it isolated—with the mystery of the life of the girl it designated for the happy creatures who lived, who traveled in her company; deploying under the pink thicket, at the height of my shoulder, the quintessence of their familiarity, for me so painful, with her and with the unknown territory of her life which I would never be able to enter.","And so was wafted to my ears the name of Gilberte, bestowed on me like a talisman which might, perhaps, enable me some day to rediscover her whom its syllables had just endowed with a definite personality, whereas, a moment earlier, she had been only something vaguely seen. So it came to me, uttered across the heads of the stocks and jasmines, pungent and cool as the drops which fell from the green watering-pipe; impregnating and irradiating the zone of pure air through which it had passed, which it set apart and isolated from all other air, with the mystery of the life of her whom its syllables designated to the happy creatures that lived and walked and travelled in her company; unfolding through the arch of the pink hawthorn, which opened at the height of my shoulder, the quintessence of their familiarity—so exquisitely painful to myself—with her, and with all that unknown world of her existence, into which I should never penetrate."

"Et en effet, elle trouvait Swann, intellectuellement, inférieur à ce qu’elle aurait cru. « Tu gardes toujours ton sang-froid, je ne peux te définir. » Elle s’émerveillait davantage de son indifférence à l’argent, de sa gentillesse pour chacun, de sa délicatesse. Et il arrive en effet souvent pour de plus grands que n’était Swann, pour un savant, pour un artiste, quand il n’est pas méconnu par ceux qui l’entourent, que celui de leurs sentiments qui prouve que la supériorité de son intelligence s’est imposée à eux, ce n’est pas leur admiration pour ses idées, car elles leur échappent, mais leur respect pour sa bonté. C’est aussi du respect qu’inspirait à Odette la situation qu’avait Swann dans le monde, mais elle ne désirait pas qu’il cherchât à l’y faire recevoir.","And indeed, she found Swann, intellectually, inferior to what she would have thought. “You always keep your cool, I can't define you. She marveled more at his indifference to money, his kindness to everyone, his delicacy. And it indeed often happens for those greater than Swann was, for a scholar, for an artist, when he is not misunderstood by those around him, that the one of their feelings which proves that the superiority of his intelligence imposed itself on them, it is not their admiration for his ideas, for they escape them, but their respect for his goodness. Odette also felt respect for Swann's position in society, but she did not want him to try to make her welcome.","And in fact she found Swann intellectually inferior to what she would have imagined. “You’re always so reserved. I can’t make you out.” She would marvel more at his indifference to money, his kindness to everyone, his refinement. And it often happens, in fact, to greater men than Swann, to a scientist or an artist, when he is not misunderstood by those around him, that the feeling on their part which proves that the superiority of his intelligence has compelled their recognition is not their admiration for his ideas, since these are beyond them, but their respect for his goodness. There was also the respect with which Odette was inspired by Swann’s position in society, but she did not want him to try to secure invitations for her.","With the result that she found Swann inferior, intellectually, to what she had supposed. ""You're always so reserved; I can't make you out."" She marvelled increasingly at his indifference to money, at his courtesy to everyone alike, at the delicacy of his mind. And indeed it happens, often enough, to a greater man than Swann ever was, to a scientist or artist, when he is not wholly misunderstood by the people among whom he lives, that the feeling in them which proves that they have been convinced of the superiority of his intellect is created not by any admiration for his ideas—for those are entirely beyond them—but by their respect for what they term his good qualities. There was also the respect with which Odette was inspired by the thought of Swann's social position, although she had no desire that he should attempt to secure invitations for herself."

"Or l’absence d’une chose, ce n’est pas que cela, ce n’est pas un simple manque partiel, c’est un bouleversement de tout le reste, c’est un état nouveau qu’on ne peut prévoir dans l’ancien.","Now the absence of a thing is not just that, it is not a simple partial lack, it is an upheaval of all the rest, it is a new state that cannot be foreseen in the old one.","But the absence of a thing is not merely that, it is not simply a partial lack, it is a disruption of everything else, it is a new state which one cannot foresee in the old.","But the absence of one part from a whole is not only that, it is not simply a partial omission, it is a disturbance of all the other parts, a new state which it was impossible to foresee from the old."
"Un jour il reçut une lettre anonyme, qui lui disait qu’Odette avait été la maîtresse d’innombrables hommes (dont on lui citait quelques-uns parmi lesquels Forcheville, M. de Bréauté et le peintre), de femmes, et qu’elle fréquentait les maisons de passe.","One day he received an anonymous letter, which told him that Odette had been the mistress of innumerable men (of whom he was quoted a few, including Forcheville, M. de Bréauté and the painter), of women, and that she frequented brothels.","One day he received an anonymous letter telling him that Odette had been the mistress of countless men (several of whom it mentioned, among them Forcheville, M. de Bréauté, and the painter), and of women too, and that she frequented houses of ill repute.","One day he received an anonymous letter which told him that Odette had been the mistress of countless men (several of whom it named, among them Forcheville, M. de Bréauté and the painter) and women, and that she frequented houses of ill-fame."
"Il regarda. Devant lui, deux vieux messieurs étaient à la fenêtre, l’un tenant une lampe, et alors, il vit la chambre, une chambre inconnue. Ayant l’habitude, quand il venait chez Odette très tard, de reconnaître sa fenêtre à ce que c’était la seule éclairée entre les fenêtres toutes pareilles, il s’était trompé et avait frappé à la fenêtre suivante qui appartenait à la maison voisine. Il s’éloigna en s’excusant et rentra chez lui, heureux que la satisfaction de sa curiosité eût laissé leur amour intact et qu’après avoir simulé depuis si longtemps vis-à-vis d’Odette une sorte d’indifférence, il ne lui eût pas donné, par sa jalousie, cette preuve qu’il l’aimait trop, qui, entre deux amants, dispense, à tout jamais, d’aimer assez, celui qui la reçoit. Il ne lui parla pas de cette mésaventure, lui-même n’y songeait plus. Mais, par moments, un mouvement de sa pensée venait en rencontrer le souvenir qu’elle n’avait pas aperçu, le heurtait, l’enfonçait plus avant et Swann avait ressenti une douleur brusque et profonde. Comme si ç’avait été une douleur physique, les pensées de Swann ne pouvaient pas l’amoindrir ; mais du moins la douleur physique, parce qu’elle est indépendante de la pensée, la pensée peut s’arrêter sur elle, constater qu’elle a diminué, qu’elle a momentanément cessé.","He looked. In front of him, two old gentlemen were at the window, one holding a lamp, and then he saw the room, an unknown room. Being in the habit, when he came to see Odette very late, of recognizing his window by the fact that it was the only lighted one among the windows that were all alike, he had made a mistake and had knocked on the next window which belonged to the neighboring house. . He walked away apologizing and returned home, happy that the satisfaction of his curiosity had left their love intact and that after having feigned a sort of indifference towards Odette for so long, he would not have given her, through his jealousy, that proof that he loved her too much, which, between two lovers, dispenses forever from loving enough the one who receives her. He did not speak to her of this misadventure, he himself no longer thought of it. But, at times, a movement of her thoughts came to meet the memory of it which she had not perceived, struck it, pushed it deeper and Swann felt a sudden and deep pain. As if it had been a physical pain, Swann's thoughts could not lessen it; but at least physical pain, because it is independent of thought, thought can dwell on it, observe that it has diminished, that it has momentarily ceased.","He looked. Before him, two old gentlemen were standing at the window, one holding a lamp, and then he saw the bedroom, a bedroom unknown to him. Because he was in the habit, when he came to Odette’s house very late, of recognizing her window by the fact that it was the only one lit among windows that were all alike, he had made a mistake and knocked at the window after hers, which belonged to the adjoining house. He went away apologizing and returned home, happy that the satisfaction of his curiosity had left their love intact and that after having simulated a sort of indifference toward Odette for so long, he had not given her, by his jealousy, that proof of loving her too much which, between two lovers, exempts forever after, from loving enough, the one who receives it. He did not talk to her about this misadventure, he himself did not think about it further. But now and then his thoughts as they moved about would come upon the memory of it which they had not noticed, bump up against it, drive it further in, and Swann would feel a sudden, deep pain.

Two old gentlemen stood facing him, in the window, one of them with a lamp in his hand; and beyond them he could see into the room, a room that he had never seen before. Having fallen into the habit, When he came late to Odette, of identifying her window by the fact that it was the only one still lighted in a row of windows otherwise all alike, he had been misled, this time, by the light, and had knocked at the window beyond hers, in the adjoining house. He made what apology he could and hurried home, overjoyed that the satisfaction of his curiosity had preserved their love intact, and that, having feigned for so long, when in Odette's company, a sort of indifference, he had not now, by a demonstration of jealousy, given her that proof of the excess of his own passion which, in a pair of lovers, fully and finally dispenses the recipient from the obligation to love the other enough. He never spoke to her of this misadventure, he ceased even to think of it himself. But now and then his thoughts in their wandering course would come upon this memory where it lay unobserved, would startle it into life, thrust it more deeply down into his consciousness, and leave him aching with a sharp, far-rooted pain. As though this had been a bodily pain, Swann's mind was powerless to alleviate it; in the case of bodily pain, however, since it is independent of the mind, the mind can dwell upon it, can note that it has diminished, that it has momentarily ceased."

"Mais déjà j’étais tout près de Mme Swann, alors je lui tirais un si grand coup de chapeau, si étendu, si prolongé, qu’elle ne pouvait s’empêcher de sourire. Des gens riaient. Quant à elle, elle ne m’avait jamais vu avec Gilberte, elle ne savait pas mon nom, mais j’étais pour elle – comme un des gardes du Bois, ou le batelier ou les canards du lac à qui elle jetait du pain – un des personnages secondaires, familiers, anonymes, aussi dénués de caractères individuels qu’un « emploi de théâtre », de ses promenades au Bois. Certains jours où je ne l’avais pas vue allée des Acacias, il m’arrivait de la rencontrer dans l’allée de la Reine-Marguerite où vont les femmes qui cherchent à être seules, ou à avoir l’air de chercher à l’être ; elle ne le restait pas longtemps, bientôt rejointe par quelque ami, souvent coiffé d’un « tube » gris, que je ne connaissais pas et qui causait longuement avec elle, tandis que leurs deux voitures suivaient.","But I was already quite close to Madame Swann, so I gave her such a big nod, so extended, so prolonged, that she couldn't help smiling.

On certain days when I hadn't seen her in the Allée des Acacias, I happened to meet her in the Allée de la Reine-Marguerite where women go who want to be alone, or to seem to be looking 'to be ; she did not stay that way for long, soon joined by some friend, often wearing a gray “tube” on her hair, whom I did not know and who chatted at length with her, while their two cars followed.","But I was already very close to Mme.

"C’est peut-être d’une impression ressentie aussi auprès de Montjouvain, quelques années plus tard, impression restée obscure alors, qu’est sortie, bien après, l’idée que je me suis faite du sadisme. On verra plus tard que, pour de tout autres raisons, le souvenir de cette impression devait jouer un rôle important dans ma vie. C’était par un temps très chaud ; mes parents qui avaient dû s’absenter pour toute la journée, m’avaient dit de rentrer aussi tard que je voudrais ; et étant allé jusqu’à la mare de Montjouvain où j’aimais revoir les reflets du toit de tuile, je m’étais étendu à l’ombre et endormi dans les buissons du talus qui domine la maison, là où j’avais attendu mon père autrefois, un jour qu’il était allé voir M. Vinteuil. Il faisait presque nuit quand je m’éveillai, je voulus me lever, mais je vis MlleVinteuil (autant que je pus la reconnaître, car je ne l’avais pas vue souvent à Combray, et seulement quand elle était encore une enfant, tandis qu’elle commençait d’être une jeune fille) qui probablement venait de rentrer, en face de moi, à quelques centimètres de moi, dans cette chambre où son père avait reçu le mien et dont elle avait fait son petit salon à elle. La fenêtre était entr’ouverte, la lampe était allumée, je voyais tous ses mouvements sans qu’elle me vît, mais en m’en allant j’aurais fait craquer les buissons, elle m’aurait entendu et elle aurait pu croire que je m’étais caché là pour l’épier.","It was perhaps from an impression I also felt with Montjouvain, a few years later, an impression that remained obscure then, that the idea that I had of sadism emerged much later. We will see later that, for completely different reasons, the memory of this impression must have played an important role in my life. It was very hot weather; my parents, who had to be away for the whole day, had told me to come back as late as I wanted; and having gone as far as the Montjouvain pond where I liked to see the reflections of the tiled roof again, I had stretched out in the shade and fallen asleep in the bushes on the embankment which dominates the house, where I had waited for my once a father, one day when he went to see M. Vinteuil. It was almost dark when I awoke, I wanted to get up, but I saw Mlle Vinteuil (as far as I could recognize her, for I had not seen her often at Combray, and only when she was still a child, she was beginning to be a young girl) who probably had just returned, facing me, a few centimeters from me, to this room where her father had received mine and which she had made her own little living room. The window was ajar, the lamp was on, I saw all her movements without her seeing me, but when I left I would have made the bushes crack, she would have heard me and she could have believed that I hid there to spy on him.","It was perhaps from an impression received also near Montjouvain, a few years later, an impression that remained obscure to me at the time, that there emerged, well after, the idea which I formed of sadism. As will be seen later, for quite other reasons the the memory of this impression was to play an important part in my life. It was during a spell of very hot weather; my parents, who had had to leave for the whole day, had told me to return home as late as I pleased; and having gone as far as the Montjouvain pond, where I liked to look at the reflections of the tile roof again, I had lain down in the shade and fallen asleep among the bushes of the hillock that overlooks the house, in the same spot where I had once waited for my father on a day when he had gone to see M. Vinteuil. It was almost night when I awoke, I wanted to stand up, but I saw Mlle. Vinteuil (insofar as I actually recognized her, because I had not seen her very often in Combray, and only when she was still a child, whereas now she was growing into a young woman), who had probably just come home, opposite me, a few inches from me, in the room in which her father had entertained my father and which she had made into her own little drawing room. The window was half open , the lamp was lit, I could see her every movement without her seeing me, but if I had gone away I would have made rustling sounds among the bushes, she would have heard me, and she might have thought I had hidden there to spy on her.","And it is perhaps from another impression which I received at Mont-jouvain, some years later, an impression which at that time was without meaning, that there arose, long afterwards, my idea of that cruel side of human passion called 'sadism.' We shall see, in due course, that for quite another reason the memory of this impression was to play an important part in my life. It was during a spell of very hot weather; my parents, who had been obliged to go away for the whole day, had told me that I might stay out as late as I pleased; and having gone as far as the Montjouvain pond, where I enjoyed seeing again the reflection of the tiled roof of the hut, I had lain down in the shade and gone to sleep among the bushes on the steep slope that rose up behind the house, just where I had waited for my parents, years before, one day when they had gone to call on M. Vinteuil. It was almost dark when I awoke, and I wished to rise and go away, but I saw Mile. Vinteuil (or thought, at least, that I recognised her, for I had not seen her often at Combray, and then only when she was still a child, whereas she was now growing into a young woman), who probably had just come in, standing in front of me, and only a few feet away from me, in that room in which her father had entertained mine, and which she had now made into a little sitting-room for herself. The window was partly open; the lamp was lighted; I could watch her every movement without her being able to see me; but, had I gone away, I must have made a rustling sound among the bushes, she would have heard me, and might have thought that I had been hiding there in order to spy upon her."
Par une générosité instinctive et une politesse involontaire elle taisait les mots prémédités qu’elle avait jugés indispensables à la pleine réalisation de son désir. Et à tous moments au fond d’elle-même une vierge timide et suppliante implorait et faisait reculer un soudard fruste et vainqueur.,By an instinctive generosity and an involuntary politeness she concealed the premeditated words which she had deemed essential to the full realization of her desire. And at all times deep within herself a timid and supplicating virgin implored and made a rough and victorious soldier recoil.,"Out of an instinctive generosity and an involuntary courtesy she did not speak the premeditated words that she had felt were indispensable to the full realization of her desire. And time and again, deep inside her, a timid and supplicant virgin entreated and forced back a rough and swaggering brawler.","With the instinctive generosity of her nature, a courtesy beyond her control, she refrained from uttering the studied words which, she had felt, were indispensable for the full realisation of her desire.

"Elles furent plus intéressées quand la veille du jour où Swann devait venir dîner, et leur avait personnellement envoyé une caisse de vin d’Asti, ma tante, tenant un numéro du Figaro où à côté du nom d’un tableau qui était à une Exposition de Corot, il y avait ces mots : « de la collection de M. Charles Swann », nous dit : « Vous avez vu que Swann a « les honneurs » du Figaro ? » – « Mais je vous ai toujours dit qu’il avait beaucoup de goût », dit ma grand’mère. – « Naturellement toi, du moment qu’il s’agit d’être d’un autre avis que nous », répondit ma grand’tante qui, sachant que ma grand’mère n’était jamais du même avis qu’elle, et n’étant pas bien sûre que ce fût à elle-même que nous donnions toujours raison, voulait nous arracher une condamnation en bloc des opinions de ma grand’mère contre lesquelles elle tâchait de nous solidariser de force avec les siennes. Mais nous restâmes silencieux. Les sœurs de ma grand’mère ayant manifesté l’intention de parler à Swann de ce mot du Figaro, ma grand’tante le leur déconseilla. Chaque fois qu’elle voyait aux autres un avantage si petit fût-il qu’elle n’avait pas, elle se persuadait que c’était non un avantage mais un mal et elle les plaignait pour ne pas avoir à les envier. « Je crois que vous ne lui feriez pas plaisir ; moi je sais bien que cela me serait très désagréable de voir mon nom imprimé tout vif comme cela dans le journal, et je ne serais pas flattée du tout qu’on m’en parlât. » Elle ne s’entêta pas d’ailleurs à persuader les sœurs de ma grand’mère ; car celles-ci par horreur de la vulgarité poussaient si loin l’art de dissimuler sous des périphrases ingénieuses une allusion personnelle, qu’elle passait souvent inaperçue de celui même à qui elle s’adressait.","They were more interested when the day before Swann was to come to dinner, and had personally sent them a case of wine from Asti, my aunt, holding a number of Le Figaro where next to the name of a painting which was at an Exhibition de Corot, there were these words: “from the collection of M. Charles Swann”, tells us: “Have you seen that Swann has “the honors” of the Figaro? – “But I always told you it had a lot of taste,” said my grandmother. ""Of course you, as long as it's a question of being of a different opinion than us,"" replied my great-aunt who, knowing that my grandmother was never of the same opinion as her, and not being quite sure that it was she herself that we were always in favor of, wanted to wrest from us a wholesale condemnation of my grandmother's opinions against which she tried to force us to show solidarity with hers. But we remained silent. My grandmother's sisters having manifested their intention of speaking to Swann about this saying from the Figaro, my great-aunt advised them against it. Each time she saw in others an advantage, however small, that she did not have, she persuaded herself that it was not an advantage but an evil and she pitied them so as not to have to envy them. “I believe you would not please him; I know very well that it would be very disagreeable to me to see my name printed vividly like that in the newspaper, and I would not be flattered at all if anyone spoke to me about it. Besides, she did not persist in persuading my grandmother's sisters; for the latter, out of a horror of vulgarity, pushed the art of concealing a personal allusion under ingenious circumlocutions so far that it often passed unnoticed by the very person to whom it was addressed.","They were more interested when, the day before Swann was to come to dinner, and had personally sent them a case of Asti wine, my aunt, holding a copy of the Figaro in which next to the title of a painting in an exhibition of Corot,16 these words appeared: “From the collection of M. Charles Swann,” said: “Did you see this? Swann is ‘front page news’ in the Figaro.” “But I’ve always told you he had a great deal of taste,” said my grandmother. “Of course you would! Anything so long as your opinion is not the same as ours,” answered my great-aunt, who, knowing that my grandmother was never of the same opinion as she, and not being quite sure that she herself was the one we always declared was right, wanted to extract from us a general condemnation of my grandmother’s convictions against which she was trying to force us into solidarity with her own. But we remained silent. When my grandmother’s sisters expressed their intention of speaking to Swann about this mention in the Figaro, my great-aunt advised them against it. Whenever she saw in others an advantage, however small, that she did not have, she persuaded herself that it was not an advantage but a detriment and she pitied them so as not to have to envy them. “I believe you would not be pleasing him at all; I am quite sure I would find it very unpleasant to see my name printed boldly like that in the newspaper, and I would not be at all gratified if someone spoke to me about it.” But she did not persist in trying to convince my grandmother’s sisters; for they in their horror of vulgarity had made such a fine art of concealing a personal allusion beneath ingenious circumlocutions that it often went unnoticed even by the person to whom it was addressed.","Their interest grew, however, when, the day before Swann was to dine with us, and when he had made them a special present of a case of Asti, my great-aunt, who had in her hand a copy of the Figaro in which to the name of a picture then on view in a Corot exhibition were added the words, ""from the collection of M. Charles Swann,"" asked: ""Did you see that Swann is 'mentioned' in the Figaro?"" ""But I have always told you,"" said my grandmother, ""that he had plenty of taste."" ""You would, of course,"" retorted my great-aunt, ""say anything just to seem different from us. "" For, knowing that my grandmother never agreed with her, and not being quite confident that it was her own opinion which the rest of us invariably endorsed, she wished to extort from us a wholesale condemnation of my grandmother's views, against which she hoped to force us into solidarity with her own. But we sat silent. My grandmother's sisters having expressed a desire to mention to Swann this reference to him in the Figaro, my great-aunt dissuaded them. Whenever she saw in others an advantage, however trivial, which she herself lacked, she would persuade herself that it was no advantage at all, but a drawback, and would pity so as not to have to envy them. ""I don't think that would please him at all; I know very well, I should hate to see my name printed like that, as large as life, in the paper, and I shouldn't feel at all flattered if anyone spoke to me about it."" She did not, however, put any very great pressure upon my grandmother's sisters, for they, in their horror of vulgarity, had brought to such a fine art the concealment of a personal allusion in a wealth of ingenious circumlocution, that it would often pass unnoticed even by the person to whom it was addressed."

"Mais d’autres fois au contraire – Odette était sur le point de partir en voyage – c’était après quelque petite querelle dont il choisissait le prétexte, qu’il se résolvait à ne pas lui écrire et à ne pas la revoir avant son retour, donnant ainsi les apparences, et demandant le bénéfice d’une grande brouille, qu’elle croirait peut-être définitive, à une séparation dont la plus longue part était inévitable du fait du voyage et qu’il faisait commencer seulement un peu plus tôt. Déjà il se figurait Odette inquiète, affligée, de n’avoir reçu ni visite ni lettre et cette image, en calmant sa jalousie, lui rendait facile de se déshabituer de la voir. Sans doute, par moments, tout au bout de son esprit où sa résolution la refoulait grâce à toute la longueur interposée des trois semaines de séparation acceptée, c’était avec plaisir qu’il considérait l’idée qu’il reverrait Odette à son retour : mais c’était aussi avec si peu d’impatience, qu’il commençait à se demander s’il ne doublerait pas volontairement la durée d’une abstinence si facile. Elle ne datait encore que de trois jours, temps beaucoup moins long que celui qu’il avait souvent passé en ne voyant pas Odette, et sans l’avoir comme maintenant prémédité. Et pourtant voici qu’une légère contrariété ou un malaise physique – en l’incitant à considérer le moment présent comme un moment exceptionnel, en dehors de la règle, où la sagesse même admettrait d’accueillir l’apaisement qu’apporte un plaisir et de donner congé, jusqu’à la reprise utile de l’effort, à la volonté – suspendait l’action de celle-ci qui cessait d’exercer sa compression ; ou, moins que cela, le souvenir d’un renseignement qu’il avait oublié de demander à Odette, si elle avait décidé la couleur dont elle voulait faire repeindre sa voiture, ou, pour une certaine valeur de bourse, si c’était des actions ordinaires ou privilégiées qu’elle désirait acquérir (c’était très joli de lui montrer qu’il pouvait rester sans la voir, mais si après ça la peinture était à refaire ou si les actions ne donnaient pas de dividende, il serait bien avancé), voici que comme un caoutchouc tendu qu’on lâche ou comme l’air dans une machine pneumatique qu’on entr’ouvre, l’idée de la revoir, des lointains où elle était maintenue, revenait d’un bond dans le champ du présent et des possibilités immédiates.","But other times, on the contrary – Odette was about to leave on a trip – it was after some little quarrel, the pretext of which he chose, that he resolved not to write to her and not to see her again before his return. , thus giving the appearances, and asking for the benefit of a great estrangement, which she would perhaps believe to be definitive, of a separation the longer part of which was inevitable because of the trip and which he caused to begin only a little earlier . Already he imagined Odette worried, distressed at having received neither a visit nor a letter, and this image, by calming his jealousy, made it easy for him to get out of the habit of seeing her. No doubt, at times, at the very end of his mind where his resolution repressed it thanks to all the interposed length of the three weeks of accepted separation, it was with pleasure that he considered the idea that he would see Odette again on his return. : but it was also with so little impatience that he began to wonder if he would not voluntarily double the duration of such an easy abstinence. It was still only three days old, a time much shorter than that which he had often passed without seeing Odette, and without having as now planned it. And yet here is that a slight annoyance or a physical discomfort - by encouraging him to consider the present moment as an exceptional moment, outside the rule, where wisdom itself would admit to welcoming the appeasement that brings a pleasure and to give leave, until the useful resumption of the effort, with the will - suspended the action of this one which ceased to exert its compression; or, less than that, the memory of some information he had forgotten to ask Odette, whether she had decided the color she wanted her car repainted, or, for a certain purse value, whether it was ordinary or preferred shares that she wanted to acquire (it was very nice to show him that he could stay without seeing her, but if after that the painting had to be redone or if the shares did not pay a dividend, he would be well advanced ), here that like a stretched rubber that we let go or like the air in a pneumatic machine that we half open, the idea of seeing her again, from the distances where she was kept, came back with a leap in the field of the present and immediate possibilities.","But there were other occasions— Odette was about to go off on a trip—when, after some little dispute for which he had chosen the pretext, he would resolve not to write to her and not to see her again before she returned, thus giving the appearance, and expecting the reward, of a more serious quarrel, which she would perhaps believe was final, to a separation the greater part of which was unavoidable because of the trip and which he was merely allowing to begin a little earlier. Already he imagined Odette uneasy, distressed at having received neither visit nor letter, and this image, by calming his jealousy, made it easy for him to break himself of the habit of seeing her. No doubt, at times, at the far end of his mind where his resolution had thrust her because of the entire interposed length of the three weeks of separation he had accepted, it was with pleasure that he contemplated the idea of seeing Odette again when she returned; but it was also with so little impatience that he began to ask himself if he would not readily double the duration of an abstinence that was so easy. It had lasted as yet only three days, a period of time much shorter than he had often spent without seeing Odette and without having as now planned it in advance. And yet at this point a slight irritation or physical discomfort—by making him consider the present moment an exceptional one, outside the rules, one in which even common wisdom would agree that he could accept the appeasement afforded by a pleasure and allow his will, until it might be useful to resume the effort, to rest—would suspend the action of the latter, which would cease to exert its pressure; or, less than that, the memory of something he had forgotten to ask Odette, whether she had decided which color she wanted to have her carriage repainted, or, with regard to a certain investment, whether it was common or preferred shares that she wanted to buy (it was all very well to show her that he could live without seeing her, but if, after that, the painting had to be done all over again or the shares paid no dividends, a lot of good it would have done him), and like a stretched piece of elastic that is let go or the air in a pneumatic machine that is opened, the idea of seeing her again, from the far distance where it had been kept, would come back in a single leap into the field of the present and of immediate possibilities.","But at other times—when Odette was on the point of going away for a holiday—it was after some trifling quarrel for which he had chosen the pretext, that he decided not to write to her and not to see her until her return, giving the appearance (and expecting the reward) of a serious rupture, which she would perhaps regard as final, to a separation, the greater part of which was inevitable, since she was going away, which, in fact, he was merely allowing to start a little sooner than it must. At once he could imagine Odette, puzzled, anxious, distressed at having received neither visit nor letter from him and this picture of her, by calming his jealousy, made it easy for him to break himself of the habit of seeing her. At odd moments, no doubt, in the furthest recesses of his brain, where his determination had thrust it away, and thanks to the length of the interval, the three weeks' separation to which he had agreed, it was with pleasure that he would consider the idea that he would see Odette again on her return; but it was also with so little impatience that he began to ask himself whether he would not readily consent to the doubling of the period of so easy an abstinence. It had lasted, so far, but three days, a much shorter time than he had often, before, passed without seeing Odette, and without having, as on this occasion he had, premeditated a separation. And yet, there and then, some tiny trace of contrariety in his mind, or of weakness in his body,—by inciting him to regard the present as an exceptional moment, one not to be governed by the rules, one in which prudence itself would allow him to take advantage of the soothing effects of a pleasure and to give his will (until the time should come when its efforts might serve any purpose) a holiday—suspended the action of his will, which ceased to exert its inhibitive control; or, without that even, the thought of some information for which he had forgotten to ask Odette, such as if she had decided in what colour she would have her carriage repainted, or, with regard to some investment, whether they were 'ordinary' or 'preference' shares that she wished him to buy (for it was all very well to shew her that he could live without seeing her, but if, after that, the carriage had to be painted over again, if the shares produced no dividend, a fine lot of good he would have done),—and suddenly, like a stretched piece of elastic which is let go, or the air in a pneumatic machine which is ripped open, the idea of seeing her again, from the remote point in time to which it had been attached, sprang back into the field of the present and of immediate possibilities."
"Mon oncle conseilla à Swann de rester un peu sans voir Odette qui ne l’en aimerait que plus, et à Odette de laisser Swann la retrouver partout où cela lui plairait. Quelques jours après, Odette disait à Swann qu’elle venait d’avoir une déception en voyant que mon oncle était pareil à tous les hommes : il venait d’essayer de la prendre de force. Elle calma Swann qui au premier moment voulait aller provoquer mon oncle, mais il refusa de lui serrer la main quand il le rencontra. Il regretta d’autant plus cette brouille avec mon oncle Adolphe qu’il avait espéré, s’il l’avait revu quelquefois et avait pu causer en toute confiance avec lui, tâcher de tirer au clair certains bruits relatifs à la vie qu’Odette avait menée autrefois à Nice. Or mon oncle Adolphe y passait l’hiver. Et Swann pensait que c’était même peut-être là qu’il avait connu Odette. Le peu qui avait échappé à quelqu’un devant lui, relativement à un homme qui aurait été l’amant d’Odette, avait bouleversé Swann. Mais les choses qu’il aurait, avant de les connaître, trouvé le plus affreux d’apprendre et le plus impossible de croire, une fois qu’il les savait, elles étaient incorporées à tout jamais à sa tristesse, il les admettait, il n’aurait plus pu comprendre qu’elles n’eussent pas été. Seulement chacune opérait sur l’idée qu’il se faisait de sa maîtresse une retouche ineffaçable. Il crut même comprendre, une fois, que cette légèreté des mœurs d’Odette qu’il n’eût pas soupçonnée, était assez connue, et qu’à Bade et à Nice, quand elle y passait jadis plusieurs mois, elle avait eu une sorte de notoriété galante. Il chercha, pour les interroger, à se rapprocher de certains viveurs ; mais ceux-ci savaient qu’il connaissait Odette ; et puis il avait peur de les faire penser de nouveau à elle, de les mettre sur ses traces. Mais lui à qui jusque-là rien n’aurait pu paraître aussi fastidieux que tout ce qui se rapportait à la vie cosmopolite de Bade ou de Nice, apprenant qu’Odette avait peut-être fait autrefois la fête dans ces villes de plaisir, sans qu’il dût jamais arriver à savoir si c’était seulement pour satisfaire à des besoins d’argent que grâce à lui elle n’avait plus, ou à des caprices qui pouvaient renaître, maintenant il se penchait avec une angoisse impuissante, aveugle et vertigineuse vers l’abîme sans fond où étaient allées s’engloutir ces années du début du Septennat pendant lesquelles on passait l’hiver sur la promenade des Anglais, l’été sous les tilleuls de Bade, et il leur trouvait une profondeur douloureuse mais magnifique comme celle que leur eût prêtée un poète ; et il eût mis à reconstituer les petits faits de la chronique de la Côte d’Azur d’alors, si elle avait pu l’aider à comprendre quelque chose du sourire ou des regards – pourtant si honnêtes et si simples – d’Odette, plus de passion que l’esthéticien qui interroge les documents subsistant de la Florence du XVe siècle pour tâcher d’entrer plus avant dans l’âme de la Primavera, de la bella Vanna, ou de la Vénus, de Botticelli. Souvent sans lui rien dire il la regardait, il songeait ; elle lui disait : « Comme tu as l’air triste ! » Il n’y avait pas bien longtemps encore, de l’idée qu’elle était une créature bonne, analogue aux meilleures qu’il eût connues, il avait passé à l’idée qu’elle était une femme entretenue ; inversement il lui était arrivé depuis de revenir de l’Odette de Crécy, peut-être trop connue des fêtards, des hommes à femmes, à ce visage d’une expression parfois si douce, à cette nature si humaine. Il se disait : « Qu’est-ce que cela veut dire qu’à Nice tout le monde sache qui est Odette de Crécy ? Ces réputations-là, même vraies, sont faites avec les idées des autres » ; il pensait que cette légende – fût-elle authentique – était extérieure à Odette, n’était pas en elle comme une personnalité irréductible et malfaisante ; que la créature qui avait pu être amenée à mal faire, c’était une femme aux bons yeux, au cœur plein de pitié pour la souffrance, au corps docile qu’il avait tenu, qu’il avait serré dans ses bras et manié, une femme qu’il pourrait arriver un jour à posséder toute, s’il réussissait à se rendre indispensable à elle. Elle était là, souvent fatiguée, le visage vidé pour un instant de la préoccupation fébrile et joyeuse des choses inconnues qui faisaient souffrir Swann ; elle écartait ses cheveux avec ses mains ; son front, sa figure paraissaient plus larges ; alors, tout d’un coup, quelque pensée simplement humaine, quelque bon sentiment comme il en existe dans toutes les créatures, quand dans un moment de repos ou de repliement elles sont livrées à elles-mêmes, jaillissait de ses yeux comme un rayon jaune. Et aussitôt tout son visage s’éclairait comme une campagne grise, couverte de nuages qui soudain s’écartent, pour sa transfiguration, au moment du soleil couchant. La vie qui était en Odette à ce moment-là, l’avenir même qu’elle semblait rêveusement regarder, Swann aurait pu les partager avec elle ; aucune agitation mauvaise ne semblait y avoir laissé de résidu. Si rares qu’ils devinssent, ces moments-là ne furent pas inutiles. Par le souvenir Swann reliait ces parcelles, abolissait les intervalles, coulait comme en or une Odette de bonté et de calme pour laquelle il fit plus tard (comme on le verra dans la deuxième partie de cet ouvrage), des sacrifices que l’autre Odette n’eût pas obtenus. Mais que ces moments étaient rares, et que maintenant il la voyait peu ! Même pour leur rendez-vous du soir, elle ne lui disait qu’à la dernière minute si elle pourrait le lui accorder car, comptant qu’elle le trouverait toujours libre, elle voulait d’abord être certaine que personne d’autre ne lui proposerait de venir.","My uncle advised Swann to go a while without seeing Odette, who would love him all the more, and advised Odette to let Swann find her wherever he pleased. A few days later, Odette told Swann that she had just had a disappointment when she saw that my uncle was like all men: he had just tried to take her by force. She calmed Swann, who at first wanted to go and provoke my uncle, but he refused to shake her hand when he met him. He regretted this quarrel with my uncle Adolphe all the more because he had hoped, if he had seen him again a few times and had been able to talk with him in complete confidence, to try to clear up certain rumors relating to the life that Odette had formerly carried out in Nice. But my uncle Adolphe used to spend the winter there. And Swann thought that might even be where he had known Odette. The little that had escaped anyone in front of him, relative to a man who would have been Odette's lover, had upset Swann. But the things he would, before knowing them, have found the most awful to learn and the most impossible to believe, once he knew them, they were forever incorporated into his sadness, he admitted them, he could no longer have understood that they had not been. Only each operated on the idea that he had of his mistress an indelible touch. He even thought he understood, once, that this levity in Odette's morals, which he had not suspected, was well enough known, and that in Baden-Baden and Nice, when she used to spend several months there, she had had a kind of gallant notoriety. He sought, to question them, to get closer to certain viveurs; but these knew that he knew Odette; and then he was afraid of making them think of her again, of putting them on her trail. But he, to whom until then nothing could have seemed as tedious as anything related to the cosmopolitan life of Baden or Nice, learning that Odette had perhaps once partied in these cities of pleasure, without that he should ever come to know if it was only to satisfy money needs that thanks to him she no longer had, or to whims that could reappear, now he bent down with helpless anguish, blind and vertiginous towards the bottomless abyss into which had gone to be engulfed those years of the beginning of the Septennium during which we spent the winter on the Promenade des Anglais, the summer under the lime trees of Baden, and he found in them a painful but magnificent depth like that which a poet would have lent them; and he would have set about reconstructing the small facts of the chronicle of the Côte d'Azur of the time, if it had been able to help him to understand something of the smile or the looks - yet so honest and so simple - of Odette, more passion than the beautician who examines the surviving documents of 15th century Florence to try to enter further into the soul of the Primavera, the bella Vanna, or the Venus, by Botticelli. Often without saying anything to her he looked at her, he thought; she said to him: “How sad you look! Not long ago, from the idea that she was a good creature, analogous to the best he had known, he had passed to the idea that she was a kept woman; conversely, he had since come back from Odette de Crécy, perhaps too well known to revelers, ladies' men, to this face with an expression sometimes so sweet, to this nature so human. He said to himself: “What does it mean that everyone in Nice knows who Odette de Crécy is? These reputations, even true ones, are made with the ideas of others”; he thought that this legend – even if it was authentic – was exterior to Odette, was not in her like an irreducible and malevolent personality; that the creature who could have been brought to do wrong was a woman with good eyes, a heart full of pity for suffering, a docile body which he had held and hugged and handled, a woman he might one day possess completely, if he succeeded in making himself indispensable to her. She was there, often tired, her face empty for a moment of the feverish and joyous preoccupation with the unknown things which made Swann suffer; she parted her hair with her hands; his forehead, his face seemed broader; then, suddenly, some simply human thought, some good feeling such as exists in all creatures, when in a moment of rest or withdrawal they are left to themselves, flashed from his eyes like a yellow ray . And immediately her whole face lit up like a gray countryside, covered with clouds which suddenly part, for her transfiguration, at the moment of the setting sun. The life that was in Odette at that moment, the very future that she seemed to gaze upon dreamily, Swann could have shared with her; no evil agitation seemed to have left any residue there. However rare they became, these moments were not useless. By memory Swann connected these plots, abolished the intervals, flowed like gold an Odette of kindness and calm for which he later made (as we will see in the second part of this work), sacrifices that the other Odette would not have obtained. But how rare these moments were, and how little he saw her now! Even for their evening date, she didn't tell him until the last minute if she could grant it to him because, counting that she would always find him free, she first wanted to be certain that no one else would offer to come.","My uncle advised Swann to let a little time go by without seeing Odette, who would only love him all the more for it, and Odette to allow Swann to meet her wherever he liked. A few days later, Odette told Swann she had just had the disappointment of discovering that my uncle was the same as every other man: he had just tried to take her by force. She quieted Swann when at first he wanted to go off and challenge my uncle, but he refused to shake his hand the next time he met him. He especially regretted this quarrel with my uncle Adolphe since he had hoped, had he seen him again from time to time and been able to chat with him in complete confidence, to try to shed some light on certain rumors relating to the life Odette had once led in Nice. For my uncle Adolphe spent his winters there. And Swann thought that perhaps it was even there that he had met Odette. The little that had been let slip by someone in his presence, relating to a man who was said to have been Odette’s lover, had greatly disturbed Swann. But the things he would have regarded, before knowing them, as the most frightful to learn and the most impossible to believe, once he knew them were incorporated forever after into his sadness, he accepted them, he would no longer have been able to understand that they did not exist. Only each one indelibly revised the idea he was forming of his mistress. He was even given to understand, at one point, that this laxness in Odette’s morals, which he would not have suspected, was fairly well known, and that in Baden and in Nice, when she used to spend a few months there, she had had a degree of amorous notoriety. He sought out certain philanderers in order to question them; but they were aware that he knew Odette; and besides, he was afraid of reminding them of her, of putting them on her track. But he to whom before then nothing could have appeared as tedious as anything relating to the cosmopolitan life of Baden or Nice, learning that Odette had perhaps led a rather riotous life in those pleasure towns, though he could never manage to find out if it had been only to satisfy a need for money which thanks to him she no longer had, or from some capricious desire which might return, now leaned with an impotent, blind, and dizzying anguish over the bottomless abyss that had swallowed up those early years of the Septennate87 during which one spent winters on the Promenade des Anglais, summers under the lime trees of Baden, and in them he saw a painful but magnificent profundity such as a poet might have lent them; and he would have devoted to the reconstruction of the petty events of the chronicle of the Côte d’Azur of that time, if that chronicle could have helped him understand something of Odette’s smile or the look in her eyes—honest and simple though they were—more passion than an aesthete examining the extant documents of fifteenth-century Florence in order to try to penetrate further into the soul of Botticelli’s Primavera, bella Vanna, or Venus.88 Often, without saying anything to her, he would gaze at her, he would daydream; she would say to him: “How sad you look!” It was not as yet very long since he had moved on from the idea that she was a good person, comparable to the best he had ever known, to the idea that she was a kept woman; inversely he had sometimes since then returned from Odette de Crécy, perhaps too well known among the fast crowd, among ladies’ men, to this face whose expression was at times so gentle, to this nature so human. He would say to himself: “What does it matter that at Nice everyone knows Odette de Crécy? Reputations of this sort, even if true, are created out of other people’s ideas”; he would reflect that this legend—even if it was authentic—lay outside Odette, was not inside her like an irreducible and baneful personality; that the creature who might have been led to do wrong was a woman with kind eyes, a heart full of pity for suffering, a submissive body which he had held, which he had clasped in his arms and handled, a woman whom one day he might come to possess entirely, if he succeeded in making himself indispensable to her. She was there, often tired, her face emptied for a moment of that feverish, joyful preoccupation with the unknown things that made Swann suffer; she would push back her hair with her hands; her forehead, her face would appear broader; then, suddenly, some ordinary human thought, some good feeling such as may be found in all individuals when in a moment of rest or reclusion they are left to themselves, would spring from her eyes like a beam of yellow sunlight. And immediately her whole face would brighten like a gray countryside covered with clouds which suddenly part, transfiguring it, at the moment the sun goes down. The life that was in Odette at that moment, even the future she seemed so dreamily to be watching, Swann could have shared with her; no evil disturbance seemed to have left its residue there. Rare though they became, these moments were not entirely useless. In memory Swann joined these fragments together, eliminated the intervals, cast, as though in gold, an Odette formed of goodness and calm for whom (as will be seen in the second part of this story) he later made sacrifices which the other Odette would never have won from him. But these moments were so rare, and he saw her so little now! Even in regard to their evening meeting, she would tell him only at the last minute if she could grant it to him, for, since she could count on his always being free, she first wanted to be certain that no one else would suggest coming around.","My uncle advised Swann not to see Odette for some days, after which she would love him all the more; he advised Odette to let Swann meet he; everywhere, and as often as he pleased. A few days later Odette told Swann that she had just had a rude awakening; she had discovered that my uncle was the same as other men; he had tried to take her by assault. She calmed Swann, who, at first, was for rushing out to challenge my uncle to a duel, but he refused to shake hands with him when they met again. He regretted this rupture all the more because he had hoped, if he had met my uncle Adolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk things over with him in strict confidence, to be able to get him to throw a light on certain rumours with regard to the life that Odette had led, in the old days, at Nice. For my uncle Adolphe used to spend the winter there, and Swann thought that it might indeed have been there, perhaps, that he had first known Odette. The few words which some one had let fall, in his hearing, about a man who, it appeared, had been Odette's lover, had left Swann dumb foundered. But the very things which he would, before knowing them, have regarded as the most terrible to learn and the most impossible to believe, were, once he knew them, incorporated for all time in the general mass of his sorrow; he admitted them, he could no longer have understood their not existing. Only, each one of them in its passage traced an indelible line, altering the picture that he had formed of his mistress. At one time indeed he felt that he could understand that this moral 'lightness,' of which he would never have suspected Odette, was perfectly well known, and that at Baden or Nice, when she had gone, in the past, to spend several months in one or the other place, she had enjoyed a sort of amorous notoriety. He attempted, in order to question them, to get into touch again with certain men of that stamp; but these were aware that he knew Odette, and, besides, he was afraid of putting the thought of her into their heads, of setting them once more upon her track. But he, to whom, up till then, nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that pertained to the cosmopolitan life of Baden or of Nice, now that he learned that Odette had, perhaps, led a 'gay' life once in those pleasure-cities, although he could never find out whether it had been solely to satisfy a want of money which, thanks to himself, she no longer felt, or from some capricious instinct which might, at any moment, revive in her, he would lean, in impotent anguish, blinded and dizzy, over the bottomless abyss into which had passed, in which had been engulfed those years of his own, early in MacMahon's Septennat, in which one spent the winter on the Promenade des Anglais, the summer beneath the limes of Baden, and would find in those years a sad but splendid profundity, such as a poet might have lent to them; and he would have devoted to the reconstruction of all the insignificant details that made up the daily round on the Côte d'Azur in those days, if it could have helped him to understand something that still baffled him in the smile or in the eyes of Odette, more enthusiasm than does the aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of fifteenth-century Florence, so as to try to penetrate further into the soul of the Primavera, the fair Vanna or the Venus of Botticelli. He would sit, often, without saying a word to her, only gazing at her and dreaming; and she would comment: ""You do look sad!"" It was not very long since, from the idea that she was an excellent creature, comparable to the best women that he had known, he had passed to that of her being 'kept'; and yet already, by an inverse process, he had returned from the Odette de Crécy, perhaps too well known to the holiday-makers, to the 'ladies' men' of Nice and Baden, to this face, the expression on which was so often gentle, to this nature so eminently human. He would ask himself: ""What does it mean, after all, to say that everyone at Nice knows who Odette de Crécy is? Reputations of that sort, even when they're true, are always based upon other people's ideas""; he would reflect that this legend—even if it were authentic—was something external to Odette, was not inherent in her like a mischievous and ineradicable personality; that the creature who might have been led astray was a woman with frank eyes, a heart full of pity for the sufferings of others, a docile body which he had pressed tightly in his arms and explored with his fingers, a woman of whom he might one day come into absolute possession if he succeeded in making himself indispensable to her. There she was, often tired, her face left blank for the nonce by that eager, feverish preoccupation with the unknown things which made Swann suffer; she would push back her hair with both hands; her forehead, her whole face would seem to grow larger; then, suddenly, some ordinary human thought, some worthy sentiment such as is to be found in all creatures when, in a moment of rest or meditation, they are free to express themselves, would flash out from her eyes like a ray of gold. And immediately the whole of her face would light up like a grey landscape, swathed in clouds which, suddenly, are swept away and the dull scene transfigured, at the moment of the sun's setting. The life which occupied Odette at such times, even the future which she seemed to be dreamily regarding, Swann could have shared with her. No evil disturbance seemed to have left any effect on them. Rare as they became, those moments did not occur in vain. By the process of memory, Swann joined the fragments together, abolished the intervals between them, cast, as in molten gold, the image of an Odette compact of kindness and tranquillity, for whom he was to make, later on (as we shall see in the second part of this story) sacrifices which the other Odette would never have won from him. But how rare those moments were, and how seldom he now saw her! Even in regard to their evening meetings, she would never tell him until the last minute whether she would be able to see him, for, reckoning on his being always free, she wished first to be certain that no one else would offer to come to her."

"J’écrivis à ma mère en la suppliant de monter pour une chose grave que je ne pouvais lui dire dans ma lettre. Mon effroi était que Françoise, la cuisinière de ma tante qui était chargée de s’occuper de moi quand j’étais à Combray, refusât de porter mon mot. Je me doutais que pour elle, faire une commission à ma mère quand il y avait du monde lui paraîtrait aussi impossible que pour le portier d’un théâtre de remettre une lettre à un acteur pendant qu’il est en scène. Elle possédait à l’égard des choses qui peuvent ou ne peuvent pas se faire un code impérieux, abondant, subtil et intransigeant sur des distinctions insaisissables ou oiseuses (ce qui lui donnait l’apparence de ces lois antiques qui, à côté de prescriptions féroces comme de massacrer les enfants à la mamelle, défendent avec une délicatesse exagérée de faire bouillir le chevreau dans le lait de sa mère, ou de manger dans un animal le nerf de la cuisse). Ce code, si l’on en jugeait par l’entêtement soudain qu’elle mettait à ne pas vouloir faire certaines commissions que nous lui donnions, semblait avoir prévu des complexités sociales et des raffinements mondains tels que rien dans l’entourage de Françoise et dans sa vie de domestique de village n’avait pu les lui suggérer ; et l’on était obligé de se dire qu’il y avait en elle un passé français très ancien, noble et mal compris, comme dans ces cités manufacturières où de vieux hôtels témoignent qu’il y eut jadis une vie de cour, et où les ouvriers d’une usine de produits chimiques travaillent au milieu de délicates sculptures qui représentent le miracle de saint Théophile ou les quatre fils Aymon. Dans le cas particulier, l’article du code à cause duquel il était peu probable que sauf le cas d’incendie Françoise allât déranger maman en présence de M. Swann pour un aussi petit personnage que moi, exprimait simplement le respect qu’elle professait non seulement pour les parents – comme pour les morts, les prêtres et les rois – mais encore pour l’étranger à qui on donne l’hospitalité, respect qui m’aurait peut-être touché dans un livre mais qui m’irritait toujours dans sa bouche, à cause du ton grave et attendri qu’elle prenait pour en parler, et davantage ce soir où le caractère sacré qu’elle conférait au dîner avait pour effet qu’elle refuserait d’en troubler la cérémonie. Mais pour mettre une chance de mon côté, je n’hésitai pas à mentir et à lui dire que ce n’était pas du tout moi qui avais voulu écrire à maman, mais que c’était maman qui, en me quittant, m’avait recommandé de ne pas oublier de lui envoyer une réponse relativement à un objet qu’elle m’avait prié de chercher ; et elle serait certainement très fâchée si on ne lui remettait pas ce mot. Je pense que Françoise ne me crut pas, car, comme les hommes primitifs dont les sens étaient plus puissants que les nôtres, elle discernait immédiatement, à des signes insaisissables pour nous, toute vérité que nous voulions lui cacher ; elle regarda pendant cinq minutes l’enveloppe comme si l’examen du papier et l’aspect de l’écriture allaient la renseigner sur la nature du contenu ou lui apprendre à quel article de son code elle devait se référer. Puis elle sortit d’un air résigné qui semblait signifier : « C’est-il pas malheureux pour des parents d’avoir un enfant pareil ! »","I wrote to my mother begging her to come upstairs for something serious that I could not tell her in my letter. My fear was that Françoise, my aunt's cook who was in charge of looking after me when I was at Combray, would refuse to carry my note. I suspected that for her, doing an errand for my mother when there were people around would seem as impossible to her as for the doorman of a theater to deliver a letter to an actor while he is on stage. It possessed with regard to things which can or cannot be made an imperious, abundant, subtle and intransigent code on elusive or idle distinctions (which gave it the appearance of those ancient laws which, alongside ferocious prescriptions like to massacre infants at the breast, prohibit with exaggerated delicacy the boiling of a kid in its mother's milk, or the eating of the nerve of the thigh in an animal). This code, judging by her sudden stubbornness in not wanting to do certain errands we gave her, seemed to have foreseen social complexities and worldly refinements such as nothing in Françoise's entourage and in his life as a village servant had not been able to suggest them to him; and one was forced to say to oneself that there was in it a very old French past, noble and misunderstood, as in those manufacturing towns where old mansions testify that there was once a life at court, and where the workers of a chemical products factory work in the middle of delicate sculptures which represent the miracle of Saint Théophile or the four sons of Aymon. In the particular case, the article of the code because of which it was unlikely that except in the case of fire Françoise would disturb Maman in the presence of M. Swann for such a small person as myself, simply expressed the respect she professed. not only for parents – as for the dead, priests and kings – but also for the stranger to whom we give hospitality, a respect that might have touched me in a book but which always irritated me in her mouth, because of the serious and tender tone she assumed when speaking of it, and more so this evening when the sanctity she conferred on the dinner meant that she would refuse to disturb the ceremony. But to put a chance on my side, I did not hesitate to lie and tell him that it was not at all I who had wanted to write to mum, but that it was mum who, when she left me, had recommended not forgetting to send her a reply relative to an object she had asked me to look for; and she would certainly be very angry if this note was not delivered to her. I don't think Françoise believed me, because, like primitive men whose senses were more powerful than ours, she immediately discerned, by signs elusive to us, any truth that we wanted to hide from her; she stared at the envelope for five minutes as if the examination of the paper and the appearance of the handwriting would inform her of the nature of the contents or tell her which article of her code she should refer to. Then she left with an air of resignation which seemed to mean: ""Isn't it unfortunate for parents to have such a child!"" »","I wrote to my mother begging her to come upstairs for something serious that I could not tell her in my letter. My fear was that Françoise, my aunt’s cook who was charged with looking after me when I was at Combray, would refuse to convey my note. I suspected that, for her, delivering a message to my mother when there was company would seem as impossible as for a porter to hand a letter to an actor while he was onstage. With respect to things that could or could not be done she possessed a code at once imperious, extensive, subtle, and intransigent about distinctions that were impalpable or otiose (which made it resemble those ancient laws which, alongside such fierce prescriptions as the massacre of children at the breast, forbid one with an exaggerated delicacy to boil a kid in its mother’s milk, or to eat the sinew from an animal’s thigh). This code, to judge from her sudden obstinacy when she did not wish to do certain errands that we gave her, seemed to have anticipated social complexities and worldly refinements that nothing in Françoise’s associations or her life as a village domestic could have suggested to her; and we had to say to ourselves that in her there was a very old French past, noble and ill understood, as in those manufacturing towns where elegant old houses testify that there was once a court life, and where the employees of a factory for chemical products work surrounded by delicate sculptures representing the miracle of Saint Théophile or the four sons of Aymon.25 In this particular case, the article of the code which made it unlikely that except in case of fire Françoise would go bother Mama in the presence of M. Swann for so small a personage as myself simply betokened the respect she professed not only for the family—as for the dead, for priests, and for kings—but also for the visitor to whom one was offering one’s hospitality, a respect that would perhaps have touched me in a book but that always irritated me on her lips, because of the solemn and tender tones she adopted in speaking of it, and especially so this evening, when the sacred character she conferred on the dinner might have the effect of making her refuse to disturb its ceremonial. But to give myself a better chance, I did not hesitate to lie and tell her that it was not in the least I who had wanted to write to Mama, but that it was Mama who, as she said goodnight to me, had exhorted me not to forget to send her an answer concerning something she had asked me to look for; and she would certainly be very annoyed if this note was not delivered to her. I think Françoise did not believe me, for, like those primitive men whose senses were so much more powerful than ours, she could immediately discern, from signs imperceptible to us, any truth that we wanted to hide from her; she looked at the envelope for five minutes as if the examination of the paper and the appearance of the writing would inform her about the nature of the contents or tell her which article of her code she ought to apply. Then she went out with an air of resignation that seemed to signify: “If it isn’t a misfortune for parents to have a child like that!”","I wrote to my mother begging her to come upstairs for an important reason which I could not put in writing. My fear was that Françoise, my aunt's cook who used to be put in charge of me when I was at Combray, might refuse to take my note. I had a suspicion that, in her eyes, to carry a message to my mother when there was a stranger in the room would appear flatly inconceivable, just as it would be for the door-keeper of a theatre to hand a letter to an actor upon the stage. For things which might or might not be done she possessed a code at once imperious, abundant, subtle, and uncompromising on points themselves imperceptible or irrelevant, which gave it a resemblance to those ancient laws which combine such cruel ordinances as the massacre of infants at the breast with prohibitions, of exaggerated refinement, against ""seething the kid in his mother's milk,"" or ""eating of the sinew which is upon the hollow of the thigh. "" This code, if one could judge it by the sudden obstinacy which she would put into her refusal to carry out certain of our instructions, seemed to have foreseen such social complications and refinements of fashion as nothing in Françoise's surroundings or in her career as a servant in a village household could have put into her head; and we were obliged to assume that there was latent in her some past existence in the ancient history of France, noble and little understood, just as there is in those manufacturing towns where old mansions still testify to their former courtly days, and chemical workers toil among delicately sculptured scenes of the Miracle of Theophilus or the Quatre Fils Aymon. In this particular instance, the article of her code which made it highly improbable that—barring an outbreak of fire—Françoise would go down and disturb Mamma when M. Swann was there for so unimportant a person as myself was one embodying the respect she shewed not only for the family (as for the dead, for the clergy, or for royalty), but also for the stranger within our gates; a respect which I should perhaps have found touching in a book, but which never failed to irritate me on her lips, because of the solemn and gentle tones in which she would utter it, and which irritated me more than usual this evening when the sacred character in which she invested the dinner-party might have the effect of making her decline to disturb its ceremonial. But to give myself one chance of success I lied without hesitation, telling her that it was not in the least myself who had wanted to write to Mamma, but Mamma who, on saying good night to me, had begged me not to forget to send her an answer about something she had asked me to find, and that she would certainly be very angry if this note were not taken to her. I think that Françoise disbelieved me, for, like those primitive men whose senses were so much keener than our own, she could immediately detect, by signs imperceptible by the rest of us, the truth or falsehood of anything that we might wish to conceal from her. She studied the envelope for five minutes as though an examination of the paper itself and the look of my handwriting could enlighten her as to the nature of the contents, or tell her to which article of her code she ought to refer the matter. Then she went out with an air of resignation which seemed to imply: ""What a dreadful thing for parents to have a child like this!"""
"Et pourtant j’ai pensé depuis que si M. Vinteuil avait pu assister à cette scène, il n’eût peut-être pas encore perdu sa foi dans le bon cœur de sa fille, et peut-être même n’eût-il pas eu en cela tout à fait tort. Certes, dans les habitudes de MlleVinteuil l’apparence du mal était si entière qu’on aurait eu de la peine à la rencontrer réalisée à ce degré de perfection ailleurs que chez une sadique ; c’est à la lumière de la rampe des théâtres du boulevard plutôt que sous la lampe d’une maison de campagne véritable qu’on peut voir une fille faire cracher une amie sur le portrait d’un père qui n’a vécu que pour elle ; et il n’y a guère que le sadisme qui donne un fondement dans la vie à l’esthétique du mélodrame. Dans la réalité, en dehors des cas de sadisme, une fille aurait peut-être des manquements aussi cruels que ceux de MlleVinteuil envers la mémoire et les volontés de son père mort, mais elle ne les résumerait pas expressément en un acte d’un symbolisme aussi rudimentaire et aussi naïf ; ce que sa conduite aurait de criminel serait plus voilé aux yeux des autres et même à ses yeux à elle qui ferait le mal sans se l’avouer. Mais, au-delà de l’apparence, dans le cœur de MlleVinteuil, le mal, au début du moins, ne fut sans doute pas sans mélange. Une sadique comme elle est l’artiste du mal, ce qu’une créature entièrement mauvaise ne pourrait être, car le mal ne lui serait pas extérieur, il lui semblerait tout naturel, ne se distinguerait même pas d’elle ; et la vertu, la mémoire des morts, la tendresse filiale, comme elle n’en aurait pas le culte, elle ne trouverait pas un plaisir sacrilège à les profaner.","And yet I have since thought that if M. Vinteuil had been able to witness this scene, he would perhaps not have yet lost his faith in the good heart of his daughter, and perhaps he would not even have was absolutely wrong in that. Certainly, in Mlle. Vinteuil's habits, the appearance of evil was so complete that it would have been hard to find it realized to this degree of perfection anywhere but in a sadist; it is by the light of the footlights of the theaters on the boulevard rather than under the lamp of a real country house that one can see a daughter making a friend spit on the portrait of a father who has lived only for she ; and it is only sadism that gives a foundation in life to the aesthetics of melodrama. In reality, apart from cases of sadism, a girl might have shortcomings as cruel as those of Mlle Vinteuil towards the memory and the wishes of her dead father, but she would not sum them up expressly in an act of symbolism. as rudimentary and as naive; what would be criminal in her conduct would be more veiled in the eyes of others and even in her eyes to her who would do evil without admitting it to herself. But, beyond the appearance, in the heart of Mlle Vinteuil, the evil, at the beginning at least, was undoubtedly not without mixture. A sadist like her is the artist of evil, which an entirely evil creature could not be, for evil would not be exterior to her, it would seem quite natural to her, would not even be distinguishable from her; and virtue, the memory of the dead, filial tenderness, as she would not worship them, she would not find a sacrilegious pleasure in profaning them.","And yet I have thought, since then, that if M. Vinteuil had been able to witness this scene, he still might not have lost his faith in his daughter’s good heart, and perhaps he would not even have been entirely wrong in that. It was true that in Mlle. Vinteuil’s habits, the appearance of evil was so complete that it would have been hard to find it so perfectly represented in anyone other than a sadist; it is behind the footlights of a popular theater rather than in the lamplight of an actual country house that one expects to see a girl encouraging her friend to spit on the portrait of a father who lived only for her; and almost nothing else but sadism provides a basis in real life for the aesthetics of melodrama. In reality, even when she is not a sadist, a girl might perhaps have failings as cruel as those of Mlle. Vinteuil with regard to the memory and wishes of her dead father, but she would not deliberately express them in an act of such rudimentary and naive symbolism; what was criminal about her behavior would be more veiled from the eyes of others and even from her own, and she would do evil without admitting it to herself. But, beyond appearances, even in Mlle. Vinteuil’s heart, the evil, in the beginning at least, was probably not unmixed. A sadist of her sort is an artist of evil, something that an entirely bad creature could not be, for then evil would not be exterior to her, it would seem to her quite natural, would not even be distinguishable from her; and as for virtue, memory of the dead, and filial tenderness, since she would not be devoutly attached to them she would take no sacrilegious pleasure in profaning them.","And yet I have since reflected that if M. Vinteuil had been able to be present at this scene, he might still, and in spite of everything, have continued to believe in his daughter's soundness of heart, and that he might even, in so doing, have been not altogether wrong. It was true that in all Mlle. Vinteuil's actions the appearance of evil was so strong and so consistent that it would have been hard to find it exhibited in such completeness save in what is nowadays called a 'sadist'; it is behind the footlights of a Paris theatre, and not under the homely lamp of an actual country house, that one expects to see a girl leading her friend on to spit upon the portrait of a father who has lived and died for nothing and no one but herself; and when we find in real life a desire for melodramatic effect, it is generally the 'sadic' instinct that is responsible for it. It is possible that, without being in the least inclined towards 'sadism,' a girl might have shewn the same outrageous cruelty as Mlle. Vinteuil in desecrating the memory and defying the wishes of her dead father, but she would not have given them deliberate expression in an act so crude in its symbolism, so lacking in subtlety; the criminal element in her behaviour would have been less evident to other people, and even to herself, since she would not have admitted to herself that she was doing wrong. But, appearances apart, in Mlle. Vinteuil's soul, at least in the earlier stages, the evil element was probably not unmixed. A 'sadist' of her kind is an artist in evil, which a wholly wicked person could not be, for in that case the evil would not have been external, it would have seemed quite natural to her, and would not even have been distinguishable from herself; and as for virtue, respect for the dead, filial obedience, since she would never have practised the cult of these things, she would take no impious delight in their profanation.

"À cette époque j’avais l’amour du théâtre, amour platonique, car mes parents ne m’avaient encore jamais permis d’y aller, et je me représentais d’une façon si peu exacte les plaisirs qu’on y goûtait que je n’étais pas éloigné de croire que chaque spectateur regardait comme dans un stéréoscope un décor qui n’était que pour lui, quoique semblable au millier d’autres que regardait, chacun pour soi, le reste des spectateurs.","At that time I had a love of the theatre, a platonic love, because my parents had never allowed me to go there before, and I imagined to myself in such an inexact way the pleasures that were tasted there that I I was not far from believing that each spectator looked like in a stereoscope a decoration which was only for him, although similar to the thousand of others which looked, each for himself, the rest of the spectators.","In those days I loved the theater, with a platonic passion since my parents had not yet allowed me to enter a theater, and I pictured to myself so inaccurately the pleasures one might experience there that I almost believed that each spectator looked as though into a stereoscope at a scene that was for him alone, though similar to the thousand others being looked at, each one for himself, by the rest of the audience.","At this date I was a lover of the theatre: a Platonic lover, of necessity, since my parents had not yet allowed me to enter one, and so incorrect was the picture I drew for myself of the pleasures to be enjoyed there that I almost believed that each of the spectators looked, as into a stereoscope, upon a stage and scenery which existed for himself alone, though closely resembling the thousand other spectacles presented to the rest of the audience individually."
"Mais quand le valet de chambre était venu apporter successivement les nombreuses lampes qui, presque toutes enfermées dans des potiches chinoises, brûlaient isolées ou par couples, toutes sur des meubles différents comme sur des autels et qui dans le crépuscule déjà presque nocturne de cette fin d’après-midi d’hiver avaient fait reparaître un coucher de soleil plus durable, plus rose et plus humain – faisant peut-être rêver dans la rue quelque amoureux arrêté devant le mystère de la présence que décelaient et cachaient à la fois les vitres rallumées – elle avait surveillé sévèrement du coin de l’œil le domestique pour voir s’il les posait bien à leur place consacrée. Elle pensait qu’en en mettant une seule là où il ne fallait pas, l’effet d’ensemble de son salon eût été détruit, et son portrait, placé sur un chevalet oblique drapé de peluche, mal éclairé. Aussi suivait-elle avec fièvre les mouvements de cet homme grossier et le réprimanda-t-elle vivement parce qu’il avait passé trop près de deux jardinières qu’elle se réservait de nettoyer elle-même dans sa peur qu’on ne les abîmât et qu’elle alla regarder de près pour voir s’il ne les avait pas écornées. Elle trouvait à tous ses bibelots chinois des formes « amusantes », et aussi aux orchidées, aux catleyas surtout, qui étaient, avec les chrysanthèmes, ses fleurs préférées, parce qu’ils avaient le grand mérite de ne pas ressembler à des fleurs, mais d’être en soie, en satin. « Celle-là a l’air d’être découpée dans la doublure de mon manteau », dit-elle à Swann en lui montrant une orchidée, avec une nuance d’estime pour cette fleur si « chic », pour cette sœur élégante et imprévue que la nature lui donnait, si loin d’elle dans l’échelle des êtres et pourtant raffinée, plus digne que bien des femmes qu’elle lui fît une place dans son salon. En lui montrant tour à tour des chimères à langues de feu décorant une potiche ou brodées sur un écran, les corolles d’un bouquet d’orchidées, un dromadaire d’argent niellé aux yeux incrustés de rubis qui voisinait sur la cheminée avec un crapaud de jade, elle affectait tour à tour d’avoir peur de la méchanceté, ou de rire de la cocasserie des monstres, de rougir de l’indécence des fleurs et d’éprouver un irrésistible désir d’aller embrasser le dromadaire et le crapaud qu’elle appelait : « chéris ». Et ces affectations contrastaient avec la sincérité de certaines de ses dévotions, notamment à Notre-Dame du Laghet qui l’avait jadis, quand elle habitait Nice, guérie d’une maladie mortelle, et dont elle portait toujours sur elle une médaille d’or à laquelle elle attribuait un pouvoir sans limites. Odette fit à Swann « son » thé, lui demanda : « Citron ou crème ? » et comme il répondit « crème », lui dit en riant : « Un nuage ! » Et comme il le trouvait bon : « Vous voyez que je sais ce que vous aimez. » Ce thé en effet avait paru à Swann quelque chose de précieux comme à elle-même, et l’amour a tellement besoin de se trouver une justification, une garantie de durée, dans des plaisirs qui au contraire sans lui n’en seraient pas et finissent avec lui, que quand il l’avait quittée à sept heures pour rentrer chez lui s’habiller, pendant tout le trajet qu’il fit dans son coupé, ne pouvant contenir la joie que cet après-midi lui avait causée, il se répétait : « Ce serait bien agréable d’avoir ainsi une petite personne chez qui on pourrait trouver cette chose si rare, du bon thé. » Une heure après, il reçut un mot d’Odette, et reconnut tout de suite cette grande écriture dans laquelle une affectation de raideur britannique imposait une apparence de discipline à des caractères informes qui eussent signifié peut-être pour des yeux moins prévenus le désordre de la pensée, l’insuffisance de l’éducation, le manque de franchise et de volonté. Swann avait oublié son étui à cigarettes chez Odette. « Que n’y avez-vous oublié aussi votre cœur, je ne vous aurais pas laissé le reprendre. »","But when the valet had come to bring successively the many lamps which, almost all enclosed in Chinese potiches, burned singly or in pairs, all on different pieces of furniture as on altars and which in the already almost nocturnal twilight of this end of he winter afternoon had made a more lasting, rosier and more human sunset reappear – perhaps making some lover in the street dream, stopped before the mystery of the presence that both revealed and hid the relighted windows – she had watched the servant sternly out of the corner of her eye to see if he was putting them down in their consecrated place. She thought that by putting a single one in the wrong place, the whole effect of her drawing-room would have been destroyed, and her portrait would have been placed on an oblique easel draped in plush, badly lit. So she feverishly followed the movements of this rude man and reprimanded him sharply because he had passed too close to two planters which she reserved for herself to clean herself in her fear that they would be damaged. and she went to look closely to see if he had not dented them. She found ""amusing"" shapes in all her Chinese trinkets, and also in orchids, especially in cattleyas, which were, along with chrysanthemums, her favorite flowers, because they had the great merit of not resembling flowers, but to be in silk, in satin. ""That one looks like it was cut out of the lining of my coat,"" she said to Swann, showing him an orchid, with a touch of esteem for this so ""chic"" flower, for this elegant and unforeseen that nature gave her, so far from her in the scale of beings and yet refined, more worthy than many women that she make room for her in her salon. By showing him in turn chimeras with tongues of fire decorating a potiche or embroidered on a screen, the corollas of a bouquet of orchids, a silver niello dromedary with ruby-encrusted eyes which stood next to a toad on the mantelpiece. of jade, she affected alternately to be afraid of wickedness, or to laugh at the comical monsters, to blush at the indecency of flowers and to feel an irresistible desire to go and kiss the dromedary and the toad that she called: ""darlings"". And these affectations contrasted with the sincerity of some of her devotions, in particular to Our Lady of Laghet who had once, when she lived in Nice, cured her of a fatal illness, and of which she always wore a gold medal. to which she attributed unlimited power. Odette made Swann ""his"" tea, asked him: ""Lemon or cream?"" » and when he answered « cream », said to him laughingly : « A cloud! And as he found it good: ""You see that I know what you like."" This tea had indeed seemed to Swann something as precious as to herself, and love so badly needs to find a justification, a guarantee of duration, in pleasures which, on the contrary, would not be pleasure without it. and end with him, that when he had left her at seven o'clock to go home to dress, during the whole trip he made in his coupe, unable to contain the joy that this afternoon had caused him, he repeated to himself: ""It would be very pleasant to have a little person in whose house one could find this very rare thing, good tea."" An hour later, he received a note from Odette, and immediately recognized this large handwriting in which an affectation of British stiffness imposed an appearance of discipline on shapeless characters which, to less prejudiced eyes, would perhaps have signified disorder. of thought, the inadequacy of education, the lack of frankness and will. Swann had forgotten his cigarette case at Odette's. “Why didn’t you also forget your heart there, I wouldn’t have let you take it back. »","But when the valet came bringing one after another the many lamps which, nearly all enclosed in large Chinese vases, burned singly or in pairs, all on different pieces of furniture as though on altars, and which had summoned back to the already almost nocturnal twilight of that late afternoon in winter a more lasting sunset, rosier and more human—perhaps making some lover stop and daydream in the street before the mystery of the presence that was at once disclosed and concealed by the glowing panes—she had watched the servant severely from the corner of her eye to see whether he was setting them down properly in their consecrated places. She thought that if even one were put where it should not be, the overall effect of her drawing room would be ruined, and her portrait, placed on a sloping stand draped in plush, would be poorly lit. And so she fervently followed the movements of the ungainly man and reprimanded him sharply when he went too close to two flower stands which she took care to clean herself for fear they would be damaged and which she now went over to examine to see if he had chipped them. She thought all her Chinese knickknacks had “amusing” shapes, as did the orchids, the cattleyas23 especially, which were, along with the chrysanthemums, her favorite flowers, because they had the great merit of not resembling flowers, but of being made of silk, or satin. “This one looks as though it were cut from the lining of my coat,” she said to Swann, showing him an orchid, with a suggestion of respect for this very “chic” flower, for this elegant and unexpected sister which nature had given her, so far removed from her on the scale of living creatures and yet so refined, more deserving than many women of being given a place in her drawing room. As she showed him, first, chimeras with tongues of fire decorating a vase or embroidered on a screen, then the corollas of a bouquet of orchids, then a dromedary of silver inlaid with niello with eyes encrusted with rubies that stood on the mantelpiece next to a jade toad, she affected, first, fear of the wickedness, or laughter at the oddity, of the monsters, then blushes at the indecency of the flowers and then an irresistible desire to go and kiss the dromedary and the toad, which she called “dears.” And these affectations contrasted with the sincerity of certain of her devotions, notably to Our Lady of Laghet,24 who had once, when she lived in Nice, cured her of a fatal illness, and whose gold medal she always wore, attributing to it unlimited powers. Odette made Swann “her” tea, asking him: “Lemon or cream?” and when he answered “Cream,” said to him laughing: “A cloud!” And when he found it good: “You see I know what you like.” This tea, in fact, seemed as precious a thing to Swann as it did to her, and love has such need to find for itself a justification, a guarantee that it will last, in pleasures which in fact would not be pleasures without it and which end when it ends, that when he left her at seven o’clock to go home and dress, during the whole trip that he made in his coupé, unable to contain the joy which the afternoon had given him, he kept repeating to himself: “How nice it would be to have a little woman like that in whose home one could always find that rare thing, a good cup of tea.” An hour later, he received a note from Odette and immediately recognized the large handwriting, in which an affectation of British stiffness imposed an appearance of discipline on ill-formed letters that would perhaps have signified, to less prejudiced eyes, an untidiness of mind, an insufficient education, a lack of frankness and resolution. Swann had forgotten his cigarette case at Odette’s. “If you had forgotten your heart here too, I would not have let you have it back.”","But when her footman began to come into the room, bringing, one after another, the innumerable lamps which (contained, mostly, in porcelain vases) burned singly or in pairs upon the different pieces of furniture as upon so many altars, rekindling in the twilight, already almost nocturnal, of this winter afternoon, the glow of a sunset more lasting, more roseate, more human—filling, perhaps, with romantic wonder the thoughts of some solitary lover, wandering in the street below and brought to a standstill before the mystery of the human presence which those lighted windows at once revealed and screened from sight—she had kept an eye sharply fixed on the servant, to see whether he set each of the lamps down in the place appointed it. She felt that, if he were to put even one of them where it ought not to be, the general effect of her drawing-room would be destroyed, and that her portrait, which rested upon a sloping easel draped with plush, would not catch the light. And so, with feverish impatience, she followed the man's clumsy movements, scolding him severely when he passed too close to a pair of beaupots, which she made a point of always tidying herself, in case the plants should be knocked over—and went across to them now to make sure that he had not broken off any of the flowers. She found something 'quaint' in the shape of each of her Chinese ornaments, and also in her orchids, the cattleyas especially (these being, with chrysanthemums, her favourite flowers), because they had the supreme merit of not looking in the least like other flowers, but of being made, apparently, out of scraps of silk or satin. ""It looks just as though it had been cut out of the lining of my cloak,"" she said to Swann, pointing to an orchid, with a shade of respect in her voice for so 'smart' a flower, for this distinguished, unexpected sister whom nature had suddenly bestowed upon her, so far removed from her in the scale of existence, and yet so delicate, so refined, so much more worthy than many real women of admission to her drawing-room. As she drew his attention, now to the fiery-tongued dragons painted upon a bowl or stitched upon a fire-screen, now to a fleshy cluster of orchids, now to a dromedary of inlaid silver-work with ruby eyes, which kept company, upon her mantelpiece, with a toad carved in jade, she would pretend now to be shrinking from the ferocity of the monsters or laughing at their absurdity, now blushing at the indecency of the flowers, now carried away by an irresistible desire to run across and kiss the toad and dromedary, calling them 'darlings.' And these affectations were in sharp contrast to the sincerity of some of her attitudes, notably her devotion to Our Lady of the Laghetto who had once, when Odette was living at Nice, cured her of a mortal illness, and whose medal, in gold, she always carried on her person, attributing to it unlimited powers. She poured out Swann's tea, inquired ""Lemon or cream?"" and, on his answering ""Cream, please,"" went on, smiling, ""A cloud!"" And as he pronounced it excellent, ""You see, I know just how you like it. "" This tea had indeed seemed to Swann, just as it seemed to her, something precious, and love is so far obliged to find some justification for itself, some guarantee of its duration in pleasures which, on the contrary, would have no existence apart from love and must cease with its passing, that when he left her, at seven o'clock, to go and dress for the evening, all the way home, sitting bolt upright in his brougham, unable to repress the happiness with which the afternoon's adventure had filled him, he kept on repeating to himself: ""What fun it would be to have a little woman like that in a place where one could always be certain of finding, what one never can be certain of finding, a really good cup of tea. "" An hour or so later he received a note from Odette, and at once recognised that florid handwriting, in which an affectation of British stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon its shapeless characters, significant, perhaps, to less intimate eyes than his, of an untidiness of mind, a fragmentary education, a want of sincerity and decision. Swann had left his cigarette-case at her house. ""Why,"" she wrote, ""did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back."""
"Que s’il s’assoupit dans une position encore plus déplacée et divergente, par exemple après dîner assis dans un fauteuil, alors le bouleversement sera complet dans les mondes désorbités, le fauteuil magique le fera voyager à toute vitesse dans le temps et dans l’espace, et au moment d’ouvrir les paupières, il se croira couché quelques mois plus tôt dans une autre contrée. Mais il suffisait que, dans mon lit même, mon sommeil fût profond et détendît entièrement mon esprit ; alors celui-ci lâchait le plan du lieu où je m’étais endormi, et quand je m’éveillais au milieu de la nuit, comme j’ignorais où je me trouvais, je ne savais même pas au premier instant qui j’étais ; j’avais seulement dans sa simplicité première le sentiment de l’existence comme il peut frémir au fond d’un animal ; j’étais plus dénué que l’homme des cavernes ; mais alors le souvenir – non encore du lieu où j’étais, mais de quelques-uns de ceux que j’avais habités et où j’aurais pu être – venait à moi comme un secours d’en haut pour me tirer du néant d’où je n’aurais pu sortir tout seul ; je passais en une seconde par-dessus des siècles de civilisation, et l’image confusément entrevue de lampes à pétrole, puis de chemises à col rabattu, recomposait peu à peu les traits originaux de mon moi.","That if he dozes off in an even more displaced and divergent position, for example after dinner sitting in an armchair, then the upheaval will be complete in the desorbed worlds, the magic armchair will make him travel at full speed in time and in the space, and at the moment of opening his eyelids, he will believe himself to have slept a few months earlier in another country. But it was enough that, even in my bed, my sleep was deep and completely relaxed my mind; then he dropped the plan of the place where I had fallen asleep, and when I woke up in the middle of the night, as I did not know where I was, I did not even know at first who I was; I only had in its first simplicity the feeling of existence as it can quiver in the depths of an animal; I was more destitute than the caveman; but then the memory – not yet of the place where I was, but of some of those where I had lived and where I could have been – came to me like help from on high to pull me out of nothingness. where I couldn't have gone out on my own; I passed in a second over centuries of civilization, and the vaguely glimpsed image of kerosene lamps, then of shirts with turned-down collars, gradually recomposed the original features of my self.","If he dozes off in a position still more displaced and divergent, after dinner sitting in an armchair for instance, then the confusion among the disordered worlds will be complete, the magic armchair will send him traveling at top speed through time and space, and, at the moment of opening his eyelids, he will believe he went to bed several months earlier in another country. But it was enough if, in my own bed, my sleep was deep and allowed my mind to relax entirely; then it would let go of the map of the place where I had fallen asleep and, when I woke in the middle of the night, since I did not know where I was, I did not even understand in the first moment who I was; I had only, in its original simplicity, the sense of existence as it may quiver in the depths of an animal; I was more destitute than a cave dweller; but then the memory—not yet of the place where I was, but of several of those where I had lived and where I might have been—would come to me like help from on high to pull me out of the void from which I could not have got out on my own; I crossed centuries of civilization in one second, and the image confusedly glimpsed of oil lamps, then of wing-collar shirts, gradually recomposed my self’s original features.","Or suppose that he gets drowsy in some even more abnormal position; sitting in an armchair, say, after dinner: then the world will fall topsy-turvy from its orbit, the magic chair will carry him at full speed through time and space, and when he opens his eyes again he will imagine that he went to sleep months earlier and in some far distant country. But for me it was enough if, in my own bed, my sleep was so heavy as completely to relax my consciousness; for then I lost all sense of the place in which I had gone to sleep, and when I awoke at midnight, not knowing where I was, I could not be sure at first who I was; I had only the most rudimentary sense of existence, such as may lurk and flicker in the depths of an animal's consciousness; I was more destitute of human qualities than the cave-dweller; but then the memory, not yet of the place in which I was, but of various other places where I had lived, and might now very possibly be, would come like a rope let down from heaven to draw me up out of the abyss of not-being, from which I could never have escaped by myself: in a flash I would traverse and surmount centuries of civilisation, and out of a half-visualised succession of oil-lamps, followed by shirts with turned-down collars, would put together by degrees the component parts of my ego."

"Ces mots « massacré par les sauvages » percèrent douloureusement le cœur de Swann ; aussitôt il éprouva le besoin de continuer la conversation avec le général : – Ah ! lui dit-il, il y a eu de bien belles vies qui ont fini de cette façon… Ainsi vous savez… ce navigateur dont Dumont d’Urville ramena les cendres, La Pérouse… (et Swann était déjà heureux comme s’il avait parlé d’Odette).

"Quand nous dormons et qu’une rage de dents n’est encore perçue par nous que comme une jeune fille que nous nous efforçons deux cents fois de suite de tirer de l’eau ou que comme un vers de Molière que nous nous répétons sans arrêter, c’est un grand soulagement de nous réveiller et que notre intelligence puisse débarrasser l’idée de rage de dents, de tout déguisement héroïque ou cadencé. C’est l’inverse de ce soulagement que j’éprouvais quand mon chagrin de monter dans ma chambre entrait en moi d’une façon infiniment plus rapide, presque instantanée, à la fois insidieuse et brusque, par l’inhalation – beaucoup plus toxique que la pénétration morale – de l’odeur de vernis particulière à cet escalier. Une fois dans ma chambre, il fallut boucher toutes les issues, fermer les volets, creuser mon propre tombeau, en défaisant mes couvertures, revêtir le suaire de ma chemise de nuit. Mais avant de m’ensevelir dans le lit de fer qu’on avait ajouté dans la chambre parce que j’avais trop chaud l’été sous les courtines de reps du grand lit, j’eus un mouvement de révolte, je voulus essayer d’une ruse de condamné.","When we sleep and a toothache is still perceived by us only as a young girl that we try two hundred times in a row to draw water or as a verse of Molière that we repeat to ourselves without stopping , it is a great relief to wake up and have our intelligence rid the idea of a toothache of any heroic or rhythmic disguise. It is the reverse of that relief I felt when my grief from going up to my room entered me infinitely faster, almost instantaneously, both insidious and sudden, through inhalation – much more toxic. than moral penetration – of the particular smell of varnish on this staircase. Once in my room, I had to block all the exits, close the shutters, dig my own tomb, undo my covers, put on the shroud of my nightgown.

"Aussi – sous le prétexte qu’une leçon qui avait été déplacée tombait maintenant si mal qu’elle m’avait empêché plusieurs fois et m’empêcherait encore de voir mon oncle – un jour, autre que celui qui était réservé aux visites que nous lui faisions, profitant de ce que mes parents avaient déjeuné de bonne heure, je sortis et au lieu d’aller regarder la colonne d’affiches, pour quoi on me laissait aller seul, je courus jusqu’à lui. Je remarquai devant sa porte une voiture attelée de deux chevaux qui avaient aux œillères un œillet rouge comme avait le cocher à sa boutonnière. De l’escalier j’entendis un rire et une voix de femme, et dès que j’eus sonné, un silence, puis le bruit de portes qu’on fermait. Le valet de chambre vint ouvrir, et en me voyant parut embarrassé, me dit que mon oncle était très occupé, ne pourrait sans doute pas me recevoir, et, tandis qu’il allait pourtant le prévenir, la même voix que j’avais entendue disait : « Oh, si !","Also - on the pretext that a lesson which had been moved was now falling so badly that it had prevented me several times and would still prevent me from seeing my uncle - on a day, other than that which was reserved for the visits which we We were doing, taking advantage of my parents having had an early lunch, I went out and instead of going to look at the column of posters, for which they let me go alone, I ran up to him. I noticed in front of his door a carriage drawn by two horses which had a red carnation in their blinkers, like the coachman had in his buttonhole. From the stairs I heard laughter and a woman's voice, and as soon as I rang the bell, silence, then the sound of doors being closed. The valet came to open the door, and on seeing me seemed embarrassed, told me that my uncle was very busy, would probably not be able to receive me, and, while he was going to warn him, the same voice that I had heard said, “Oh, yes!","And so—using the excuse that a lesson which had been moved now came at such an awkward hour that it had prevented me several times and would continue to prevent me from seeing my uncle—one day, different from the day set apart for the visits we made to him, taking advantage of the fact that my parents had had lunch early , I went out and, instead of going to look at the column of posters, for which I was allowed to go out alone, I ran to him.

I noticed before his door a carriage and pair, with red carnations on the horses' blinkers and in the coachman's buttonhole. As I climbed the staircase I could hear laughter and a woman's voice, and, as soon as I had rung, silence and the sound of shutting doors. The man-servant who let me in appeared embarrassed, and said that my uncle was extremely busy and probably could not see me; he went in, however, to announce my arrival, and the same voice I had heard before said: ""Oh, yes!"

"Il n’était pas comme tant de gens qui, par paresse, ou sentiment résigné de l’obligation que crée la grandeur sociale de rester attaché à un certain rivage, s’abstiennent des plaisirs que la réalité leur présente en dehors de la position mondaine où ils vivent cantonnés jusqu’à leur mort, se contentant de finir par appeler plaisirs, faute de mieux, une fois qu’ils sont parvenus à s’y habituer, les divertissements médiocres ou les supportables ennuis qu’elle renferme. Swann, lui, ne cherchait pas à trouver jolies les femmes avec qui il passait son temps, mais à passer son temps avec les femmes qu’il avait d’abord trouvées jolies. Et c’était souvent des femmes de beauté assez vulgaire, car les qualités physiques qu’il recherchait sans s’en rendre compte étaient en complète opposition avec celles qui lui rendaient admirables les femmes sculptées ou peintes par les maîtres qu’il préférait. La profondeur, la mélancolie de l’expression, glaçaient ses sens que suffisait au contraire à éveiller une chair saine, plantureuse et rose.","He was not like so many people who, out of laziness, or resigned feeling of the obligation which social greatness creates to remain attached to a certain shore, abstain from the pleasures that reality presents to them outside the worldly position. where they live confined until their death, being content to end up calling pleasures, for want of anything better, once they have managed to get used to it, the mediocre entertainments or the bearable boredoms that it contains. Swann, for his part, did not seek to find the women with whom he spent his time pretty, but to spend his time with the women he had first found pretty. And they were often women of rather vulgar beauty, because the physical qualities he sought without realizing it were in complete opposition to those which made him admire the women sculpted or painted by the masters he preferred. The depth, the melancholy of the expression froze his senses, which on the contrary sufficed to awaken a healthy, buxom and rosy flesh.","He was not like so many people who from laziness or a resigned sense of the obligation created by social grandeur to remain moored to a certain shore, abstain from the pleasures real life offers them outside the high-society position in which they live billeted and encamped until their death, contenting themselves in the end with describing as pleasures, for lack of any better, once they have managed to become used to them, the mediocre amusements or bearable tedium it contains. Swann did not try to convince himself that the women with whom he spent his time were pretty, but to spend his time with women he already knew were pretty. And these were often women of a rather vulgar beauty, for the physical qualities that he looked for without realizing it were the direct opposite of those he admired in the women sculpted or painted by his favorite masters. Depth of expression, melancholy, would freeze his senses, which were, however, immediately aroused by flesh that was healthy, plump, and pink.","Unlike so many people, who, either from lack of energy or else from a resigned sense of the obligation laid upon them by their social grandeur to remain moored like houseboats to a certain point on the bank of the stream of life, abstain from the pleasures which are offered to them above and below that point, that degree in life in which they will remain fixed until the day of their death, and are content, in the end, to describe as pleasures, for want of any better, those mediocre distractions, that just not intolerable tedium which is enclosed there with them; Swann would endeavour not to find charm and beauty in the women with whom he must pass time, but to pass his time among women whom he had already found to be beautiful and charming. And these were, as often as not, women whose beauty was of a distinctly 'common' type, for the physical qualities which attracted him instinctively, and without reason, were the direct opposite of those that he admired in the women painted or sculptured by his favourite masters. Depth of character, or a melancholy expression on a woman's face would freeze his senses, which would, however, immediately melt at the sight of healthy, abundant, rosy human flesh."
"Puis Swann soupçonna Rémi, qui, il est vrai, n’aurait pu qu’inspirer la lettre, mais cette piste lui parut un instant la bonne. D’abord Lorédan avait des raisons d’en vouloir à Odette. Et puis comment ne pas supposer que nos domestiques, vivant dans une situation inférieure à la nôtre, ajoutant à notre fortune et à nos défauts des richesses et des vices imaginaires pour lesquels ils nous envient et nous méprisent, se trouveront fatalement amenés à agir autrement que des gens de notre monde ? Il soupçonna aussi mon grand-père. Chaque fois que Swann lui avait demandé un service, ne le lui avait-il pas toujours refusé ? puis avec ses idées bourgeoises il avait pu croire agir pour le bien de Swann. Celui-ci soupçonna encore Bergotte, le peintre, les Verdurin, admira une fois de plus au passage la sagesse des gens du monde de ne pas vouloir frayer avec ces milieux artistes où de telles choses sont possibles, peut-être même avouées sous le nom de bonnes farces ; mais il se rappelait des traits de droiture de ces bohèmes, et les rapprocha de la vie d’expédients, presque d’escroqueries, où le manque d’argent, le besoin de luxe, la corruption des plaisirs conduisent souvent l’aristocratie. Bref cette lettre anonyme prouvait qu’il connaissait un être capable de scélératesse, mais il ne voyait pas plus de raison pour que cette scélératesse fût cachée dans le tuf – inexploré d’autrui – du caractère de l’homme tendre que de l’homme froid, de l’artiste que du bourgeois, du grand seigneur que du valet. Quel critérium adopter pour juger les hommes ? au fond il n’y avait pas une seule des personnes qu’il connaissait qui ne pût être capable d’une infamie. Fallait-il cesser de les voir toutes ? Son esprit se voila ; il passa deux ou trois fois ses mains sur son front, essuya les verres de son lorgnon avec son mouchoir, et, songeant qu’après tout, des gens qui le valaient fréquentaient M. de Charlus, le prince des Laumes, et les autres, il se dit que cela signifiait, sinon qu’ils fussent incapables d’infamie, du moins que c’est une nécessité de la vie à laquelle chacun se soumet de fréquenter des gens qui n’en sont peut-être pas incapables. Et il continua à serrer la main à tous ces amis qu’il avait soupçonnés, avec cette réserve de pur style qu’ils avaient peut-être cherché à le désespérer. Quant au fond même de la lettre, il ne s’en inquiéta pas, car pas une des accusations formulées contre Odette n’avait l’ombre de vraisemblance. Swann comme beaucoup de gens avait l’esprit paresseux et manquait d’invention. Il savait bien comme une vérité générale que la vie des êtres est pleine de contrastes, mais pour chaque être en particulier il imaginait toute la partie de sa vie qu’il ne connaissait pas comme identique à la partie qu’il connaissait. Il imaginait ce qu’on lui taisait à l’aide de ce qu’on lui disait. Dans les moments où Odette était auprès de lui, s’ils parlaient ensemble d’une action indélicate commise, ou d’un sentiment indélicat éprouvé par un autre, elle les flétrissait en vertu des mêmes principes que Swann avait toujours entendu professer par ses parents et auxquels il était resté fidèle ; et puis elle arrangeait ses fleurs, elle buvait une tasse de thé, elle s’inquiétait des travaux de Swann. Donc Swann étendait ces habitudes au reste de la vie d’Odette, il répétait ces gestes quand il voulait se représenter les moments où elle était loin de lui. Si on la lui avait dépeinte telle qu’elle était, ou plutôt qu’elle avait été si longtemps avec lui, mais auprès d’un autre homme, il eût souffert, car cette image lui eût paru vraisemblable. Mais qu’elle allât chez des maquerelles, se livrât à des orgies avec des femmes, qu’elle menât la vie crapuleuse de créatures abjectes, quelle divagation insensée à la réalisation de laquelle, Dieu merci, les chrysanthèmes imaginés, les thés successifs, les indignations vertueuses ne laissaient aucune place. Seulement de temps à autre, il laissait entendre à Odette que, par méchanceté, on lui racontait tout ce qu’elle faisait ; et, se servant à propos d’un détail insignifiant mais vrai, qu’il avait appris par hasard, comme s’il était le seul petit bout qu’il laissât passer malgré lui, entre tant d’autres, d’une reconstitution complète de la vie d’Odette qu’il tenait cachée en lui, il l’amenait à supposer qu’il était renseigné sur des choses qu’en réalité il ne savait ni même ne soupçonnait, car si bien souvent il adjurait Odette de ne pas altérer la vérité, c’était seulement, qu’il s’en rendît compte ou non, pour qu’Odette lui dît tout ce qu’elle faisait. Sans doute, comme il le disait à Odette, il aimait la sincérité, mais il l’aimait comme une proxénète pouvant le tenir au courant de la vie de sa maîtresse. Aussi son amour de la sincérité n’étant pas désintéressé, ne l’avait pas rendu meilleur. La vérité qu’il chérissait c’était celle que lui dirait Odette ; mais lui-même, pour obtenir cette vérité, ne craignait pas de recourir au mensonge, le mensonge qu’il ne cessait de peindre à Odette comme conduisant à la dégradation toute créature humaine. En somme il mentait autant qu’Odette parce que, plus malheureux qu’elle, il n’était pas moins égoïste. Et elle, entendant Swann lui raconter ainsi à elle-même des choses qu’elle avait faites, le regardait d’un air méfiant, et, à toute aventure, fâché, pour ne pas avoir l’air de s’humilier et de rougir de ses actes.","Then Swann suspected Rémi, who, it is true, could only have inspired the letter, but this track seemed to him for a moment the right one. First Lorédan had reason to be angry with Odette. And then how not to suppose that our servants, living in a situation inferior to ours, adding to our fortune and our faults imaginary riches and vices for which they envy and despise us, will inevitably find themselves led to act otherwise than people in our world? He also suspected my grandfather. Whenever Swann had asked him for a favor, hadn't he always refused it? then, with his bourgeois ideas, he had thought he was acting for the good of Swann. The latter still suspected Bergotte, the painter, the Verdurins, once again admiring the wisdom of society people in not wanting to mix with those artistic circles where such things are possible, perhaps even admitted under the name good pranks; but he remembered the traits of righteousness of these bohemians, and related them to the life of expedients, almost swindles, where the lack of money, the need for luxury, the corruption of pleasures often lead the aristocracy. In short, this anonymous letter proved that he knew a being capable of villainy, but he saw no more reason for this villainy to be hidden in the tuff – unexplored by others – of the character of the tender man than of the man cold, of the artist than of the bourgeois, of the great lord than of the valet. What criterion should be adopted to judge men? deep down there was not a single person he knew who could not be capable of infamy. Should we stop seeing them all? His mind clouded; he passed his hands two or three times over his forehead, wiped the glasses of his eyeglass with his handkerchief, and, thinking that after all, people who were worthy of him frequented M. de Charlus, the Prince des Laumes, and the others, he told himself that this meant, if not that they were incapable of infamy, at least that it is a necessity of life to which everyone submits to associate with people who are perhaps not incapable of it. And he continued to shake hands with all those friends he had suspected, with that formal reserve that they had perhaps sought to drive him to despair. As for the substance of the letter itself, he did not worry about it, for not one of the accusations formulated against Odette had the shadow of likelihood. Swann like many people had a lazy mind and lacked invention. He well knew as a general truth that the lives of beings are full of contrasts, but for each particular being he imagined the whole part of his life that he did not know as identical to the part that he did know. He imagined what was being concealed from him with the help of what was being said to him. When Odette was with him, if they spoke together of an indelicate act committed, or of an indelicate feeling experienced by another, she stigmatized them by virtue of the same principles that Swann had always heard professed by his parents. and to which he had remained faithful; and then she was arranging her flowers, she was drinking a cup of tea, she was worrying about Swann's work. So Swann extended these habits to the rest of Odette's life, he repeated these gestures when he wanted to imagine the times when she was far from him. If she had been depicted to him as she was, or rather as she had been so long with him, but with another man, he would have suffered, for this image would have seemed probable to him. But that she went to madams, indulged in orgies with women, that she led the villainous life of abject creatures, what a senseless rambling for the realization of which, thank God, the imagined chrysanthemums, the successive teas, the Virtuous indignations left no room. Only from time to time he gave Odette to understand that out of spite they told her everything she did; and, making use of an insignificant but true detail, which he had learned by chance, as if it were the only little piece of a complete reconstruction of Odette's life which he kept hidden within him, he led him to suppose that he was informed about things which in reality he did not know or even suspect, for so often he begged Odette not to altering the truth was only, whether he realized it or not, so that Odette would tell him everything she was doing. No doubt, as he said to Odette, he loved sincerity, but he loved her like a pimp who could keep him informed of the life of his mistress. Also his love of sincerity, not being disinterested, had not made him better. The truth he cherished was that which Odette would tell him; but he himself, in order to obtain this truth, was not afraid to resort to lying, the lying which he never ceased to paint to Odette as leading to the degradation of every human creature. In short, he lied as much as Odette because, more unhappy than she, he was no less selfish. And she, hearing Swann tell her thus to herself of the things she had done, looked at him with a distrustful air, and, at all events, angry, so as not to appear to humble herself and blush. of his actions.","Then Swann suspected Rémi, who, it was true, could merely have inspired the letter, but for a moment he felt he was on the right track. In the first place Lorédan had reasons for resenting Odette. And then how can we help but imagine that our servants, living in a situation inferior to ours, adding to our fortunes and our faults imaginary wealth and vices for which they envy and despise us, will find themselves inevitably led to act in a way different from people of our own class? He also suspected my grandfather. Each time Swann had asked a favor of him, had he not always refused? And then with his bourgeois ideas he might have thought he was acting for Swann’s own good. Swann also suspected Bergotte, the painter, the Verdurins, admired once more in passing the wisdom of society people in not wanting to mix in those artistic circles in which such things are possible, perhaps even openly admitted as good pranks; but he recalled certain honest traits in those bohemians, and contrasted them with the life of expediency, almost of fraudulence, into which the lack of money, the craving for luxury, the corrupting influence of their pleasures so often drive members of the aristocracy. In short, this anonymous letter proved that he knew an individual capable of villainy, but he could see no more reason why that villainy should be hidden in the bedrock—unexplored by any other person—of the character of an affectionate man rather than a cold one, an artist rather than a bourgeois, a great lord rather than a valet. What criterion should one adopt for judging men? Really there was not a single person among those he knew who might not be capable of infamy. Was it necessary to stop seeing all of them? His mind clouded over; he passed his hands across his forehead two or three times, wiped the lenses of his lorgnon with his handkerchief, and thinking that after all men as good as himself associated with M. de Charlus, the Prince des Laumes, and the others, he said to himself that this meant, if not that they were incapable of infamy, at least that it is a necessity of life to which each of us submits, to associate with people who are perhaps not incapable of it. And he continued to shake hands with all of those friends whom he had suspected, with the one purely formal reservation that they had perhaps tried to drive him to despair. As for the actual substance of the letter, he did not worry about it, because not one of the accusations formulated against Odette had a shadow of likelihood. Swann, like many people, had a lazy mind and lacked the faculty of invention. He knew very well as a general truth that people’s lives are full of contrasts, but for each person in particular he imagined the whole part of his life that he did not know as being identical to the part that he knew. He imagined what he was not told with the help of what he was told. During the times when Odette was with him, if they were talking about some indelicate act committed or some indelicate feeling experienced by someone else, she would stigmatize them by virtue of the same principles that Swann had always heard professed by his parents and to which he had remained faithful; and then she would arrange her flowers, she would drink a cup of tea , she would worry about Swann’s work. And so Swann extended these habits to the rest of Odette’s life, he repeated these gestures when he wanted to picture to himself the times when she was away from him. If anyone had portrayed her to him as she was, or rather as she had been with him for so long, but in the company of another man, he would have suffered, because that image would have appeared to him quite likely. But to think that she went to procuresses, took part in orgies with other women, that she led the dissolute life of the most abject of creatures—what an insane aberration, for the realization of which, God be thanked, the imagined chrysanthemums, the successive teas, the virtuous indignation left no room! Only from time to time, he would insinuate to Odette that, out of spite, someone had been reporting to him about everything she did; and, making use, in connection with this, of an insignificant but true detail, which he had learned by chance, as if it were the sole fragment among many others that he had allowed to slip out despite himself, of a complete reconstruction of Odette’s life which he kept hidden inside himself, he would lead her to suppose that he was well informed about things that in reality he did not know or even suspect, for if quite often he adjured Odette not to alter the truth, it was only, whether he realized it or not, so that she would tell him everything she did. Undoubtedly, as he said to Odette, he loved sincerity, but he loved it as a procuress who could keep him in touch with his mistress’s life. And so his love of sincerity, not being disinterested, had not made him a better person. The truth he cherished was the truth Odette would tell him; but he himself, in order to obtain that truth, was not afraid to resort to falsehood, that very same falsehood which he constantly portrayed to Odette as leading every human creature down to utter degradation. And so he lied as much as Odette because, while unhappier than she, he was no less selfish. And she, hearing Swann tell her the things she had done, would gaze at him with a look of mistrust, and, just to be on the safe side, of vexation, so as not to seem to be humiliating herself and blushing at her actions.","Then he suspected Rémi, who, it was true, could only have inspired the letter, but he now felt himself, for a moment, to be on the right track. To begin with, Loredan had his own reasons for wishing harm to Odette. And then, how were we not to suppose that our servants, living in a situation inferior to our own, adding to our fortunes and to our frailties imaginary riches and vices for which they at once envied and despised us, should not find themselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own class? He also suspected my grandfather. On every occasion when Swann had asked him to do him any service, had he not invariably declined? Besides, with his ideas of middle-class respectability, he might have thought that he was acting for Swann's good. He suspected, in turn, Bergotte, the painter, the Verdurins; paused for a moment to admire once again the wisdom of people in society, who refused to mix in the artistic circles in which such things were possible, were, perhaps, even openly avowed, as excellent jokes; but then he recalled the marks of honesty that were to be observed in those Bohemians, and contrasted them with the life of expedients, often bordering on fraudulence, to which the want of money, the craving for luxury, the corrupting influence of their pleasures often drove members of the aristocracy. In a word, this anonymous letter proved that he himself knew a human being capable of the most infamous conduct, but he could see no reason why that infamy should lurk in the depths—which no strange eye might explore—of the warm heart rather than the cold, the artist's rather than the business-man's, the noble's rather than the flunkey's. What criterion ought one to adopt, in order to judge one's fellows? After all, there was not a single one of the people whom he knew who might not, in certain circumstances, prove capable of a shameful action. Must he then cease to see them all? His mind grew clouded; he passed his hands two or three times across his brow, wiped his glasses with his handkerchief, and remembering that, after all, men who were as good as himself frequented the society of M. de Charlus, the Prince des Laumes and the rest, he persuaded himself that this meant, if not that they were incapable of shameful actions, at least that it was a necessity in human life, to which everyone must submit, to frequent the society of people who were, perhaps, not incapable of such actions. And he continued to shake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected, with the purely formal reservation that each one of them had, possibly, been seeking to drive him to despair. As for the actual contents of the letter, they did not disturb him; for in not one of the charges which it formulated against Odette could he see the least vestige of fact. Like many other men, Swann had a naturally lazy mind, and was slow in invention. He knew quite well as a general truth, that human life is full of contrasts, but in the case of any one human being he imagined all that part of his or her life with which he was not familiar as being identical with the part with which he was. He imagined what was kept secret from him in the light of what was revealed. At such times as he spent with Odette, if their conversation turned upon an indelicate act committed, or an indelicate sentiment expressed by some third person, she would ruthlessly condemn the culprit by virtue of the same moral principles which Swann had always heard expressed by his own parents, and to which he himself had remained loyal; and then, she would arrange her flowers, would sip her tea, would shew an interest in his work. So Swann extended those habits to fill the rest of her life, he reconstructed those actions when he wished to form a picture of the moments in which he and she were apart. If anyone had portrayed her to him as she was, or rather as she had been for so long with himself, but had substituted some other man, he would have been distressed, for such a portrait would have struck him as lifelike. But to suppose that she went to bad houses, that she abandoned herself to orgies with other women, that she led the crapulous existence of the most abject, the most contemptible of mortals—would be an insane wandering of the mind, for the realisation of which, thank heaven, the chrysanthemums that he could imagine, the daily cups of tea, the virtuous indignation left neither time nor place. Only, now and again, he gave Odette to understand that people maliciously kept him informed of everything that she did; and making opportune use of some detail—insignificant but true—which he had accidentally learned, as though it were the sole fragment which he would allow, in spite of himself, to pass his lips, out of the numberless other fragments of that complete reconstruction of her daily life which he carried secretly in his mind, he led her to suppose that he was perfectly informed upon matters, which, in reality, he neither knew nor suspected, for if he often adjured Odette never to swerve from or make alteration of the truth, that was only, whether he realised it or no, in order that Odette should tell him everything that she did. No doubt, as he used to assure Odette, he loved sincerity, but only as he might love a pander who could keep him in touch with the daily life of his mistress. Moreover, his love of sincerity, not being disinterested, had not improved his character. The truth which he cherished was that which Odette would tell him; but he himself, in order to extract that truth from her, was not afraid to have recourse to falsehood, that very falsehood which he never ceased to depict to Odette as leading every human creature down to utter degradation. In a word, he lied as much as did Odette, because, while more unhappy than she, he was no less egotistical. And she, when she heard him repeating thus to her the things that she had done, would stare at him with a look of distrust and, at all hazards, of indignation, so as not to appear to be humiliated, and to be blushing for her actions."
"Mon père lui en reparla dans nos rencontres ultérieures, le tortura de questions, ce fut peine inutile : comme cet escroc érudit qui employait à fabriquer de faux palimpsestes un labeur et une science dont la centième partie eût suffi à lui assurer une situation plus lucrative, mais honorable, M.

"Tous les soirs je me plaisais à imaginer cette lettre, je croyais la lire, je m’en récitais chaque phrase. Tout d’un coup je m’arrêtais effrayé. Je comprenais que si je devais recevoir une lettre de Gilberte, ce ne pourrait pas en tous cas être celle-là, puisque c’était moi qui venais de la composer.

Même si par une invraisemblable coïncidence, c’eût été justement la lettre que j’avais inventée que de son côté m’eût adressée Gilberte, y reconnaissant mon œuvre, je n’eusse pas eu l’impression de recevoir quelque chose qui ne vînt pas de moi, quelque chose de réel, de nouveau, un bonheur extérieur à mon esprit, indépendant de ma volonté, vraiment donné par l’amour.","Every evening I liked to imagine this letter, I thought I was reading it, I recited every sentence to myself.

"Le baron lui promit d’aller faire la visite qu’il désirait après qu’il l’aurait conduit jusqu’à la porte de l’hôtel Saint-Euverte, où Swann arriva tranquillisé par la pensée que M. de Charlus passerait la soirée rue La Pérouse, mais dans un état de mélancolique indifférence à toutes les choses qui ne touchaient pas Odette, et en particulier aux choses mondaines, qui leur donnait le charme de ce qui, n’étant plus un but pour notre volonté, nous apparaît en soi-même. Dès sa descente de voiture, au premier plan de ce résumé fictif de leur vie domestique que les maîtresses de maison prétendent offrir à leurs invités les jours de cérémonie et où elles cherchent à respecter la vérité du costume et celle du décor, Swann prit plaisir à voir les héritiers des « tigres » de Balzac, les grooms, suivants ordinaires de la promenade, qui, chapeautés et bottés, restaient dehors devant l’hôtel sur le sol de l’avenue, ou devant les écuries, comme des jardiniers auraient été rangés à l’entrée de leurs parterres. La disposition particulière qu’il avait toujours eue à chercher des analogies entre les êtres vivants et les portraits des musées s’exerçait encore mais d’une façon plus constante et plus générale ; c’est la vie mondaine tout entière, maintenant qu’il en était détaché, qui se présentait à lui comme une suite de tableaux. Dans le vestibule où, autrefois, quand il était un mondain, il entrait enveloppé dans son pardessus pour en sortir en frac, mais sans savoir ce qui s’y était passé, étant par la pensée, pendant les quelques instants qu’il y séjournait, ou bien encore dans la fête qu’il venait de quitter, ou bien déjà dans la fête où on allait l’introduire, pour la première fois il remarqua, réveillée par l’arrivée inopinée d’un invité aussi tardif, la meute éparse, magnifique et désœuvrée de grands valets de pied qui dormaient çà et là sur des banquettes et des coffres et qui, soulevant leurs nobles profils aigus de lévriers, se dressèrent et, rassemblés, formèrent le cercle autour de lui.","The baron promised to go and pay the visit he desired after he had conducted him to the door of the Hôtel Saint-Euverte, where Swann arrived reassured by the thought that M. de Charlus would spend the evening rue La Pérouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to all things that did not touch Odette, and in particular to worldly things, which gave them the charm of what, no longer being a goal for our will, appears to us in oneself. As soon as he got out of the car, in the foreground of this fictitious summary of their domestic life that the mistresses of the house claim to offer their guests on ceremonial days and where they seek to respect the truth of the costume and that of the decor, Swann took pleasure in to see the heirs of Balzac's ""tigers"", the grooms, ordinary followers of the walk, who, hats and boots, remained outside in front of the hotel on the ground of the avenue, or in front of the stables, as gardeners would have been lined up at the entrance to their flowerbeds. The special disposition he had always had to seek analogies between living beings and portraits in museums was still exercised, but in a more constant and more general way; it was the whole of worldly life, now that he was detached from it, which presented itself to him like a series of pictures. In the vestibule where, formerly, when he was a socialite, he entered wrapped in his overcoat to come out in tailcoat, but without knowing what had happened there, being in thought, during the few moments he stayed there , either at the party he had just left, or already at the party where he was going to be introduced, for the first time he noticed, awakened by the unexpected arrival of such a late guest, the scattered pack , magnificent and idle, tall footmen who slept here and there on benches and chests and who, raising their noble, pointed greyhound profiles, rose up and, gathered together, formed a circle around him.","The Baron promised to go and pay the visit that Swann wanted after he had driven him to the door of the Saint-Euverte house, where Swann arrived soothed by the thought that M. de Charlus would be spending the evening in the rue La Pérouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to everything that did not concern Odette, and in particular to the accoutrements of fashionable life, which gave them the charm that is to be found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire, appears to us in its own guise. As soon as he descended from the carriage, in the foreground of that fictitious summary of their domestic life which hostesses like to offer their guests on ceremonial occasions and in which they seek to respect accuracy of costume and setting, Swann enjoyed the sight of those descendants of Balzac’s “tigers,”89 the grooms, who normally followed along on the daily outing, now hatted and booted and posted outside in front of the house on the soil of the avenue, or in front of the stables, like gardeners lined up at the entrances to their flower beds. The particular tendency he had always had to look for analogies between living people and portraits in museums was still active but in a more constant and general way; it was society as a whole, now that he was detached from it, which presented itself to him as a series of pictures. In the hall which in the old days, when he went out regularly into society, he would walk into wrapped in his overcoat and leave in his tails, but without knowing what had happened there, his mind having been, during the few moments he had stayed there, either still at the party he had just left, or already at the party he was about to be shown into, for the first time he noticed, woken by the unexpected arrival of the late guest, the scattered pack of magnificent, tall, idle footmen sleeping here and there on benches and chests who, raising their sharp, noble, greyhound profiles, stood up and gathered in a circle around him.","His friend promised to go and do as Swann wished as soon as he had deposited him at the door of the Saint-Euverte house, where he arrived soothed by the thought that M. de Charlus would be spending the evening in the Rue La Pérouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to everything that did not involve Odette, and in particular to the details of fashionable life, a state which invested them with the charm that is to be found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire, appears to us in its own guise. On alighting from his carriage, in the foreground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which hostesses are pleased to offer to their guests on ceremonial occasions, and in which they shew a great regard for accuracy of costume and setting, Swann was amused to discover the heirs and successors of Balzac's 'tigers'—now 'grooms'—. who normally followed their mistress when she walked abroad, but now, hatted and booted, were posted out of doors, in front of the house on the gravelled drive, or outside the stables, as gardeners might be drawn up for inspection at the ends of their several flower-beds. The peculiar tendency which he had always had to look for analogies between living people and the portraits in galleries reasserted itself here, but in a more positive and more general form; it was society as a whole, now that he was detached from it, which presented itself to him in a series of pictures. In the cloak-room, into which, in the old days, when he was still a man of fashion, he would have gone in his overcoat, to emerge from it in evening dress, but without any impression of what had occurred there, his mind having been, during the minute or two that he had spent in it, either still at the party which he had just left, or already at the party into which he was just about to be ushered, he now noticed, for the first time, roused by the unexpected arrival of so belated a guest, the scattered pack of splendid effortless animals, the enormous footmen who were drowsing here and there upon benches and chests, until, pointing their noble greyhound profiles, they towered upon their feet and gathered in a circle round about him."
Voyez-vous ces braves gens s’ils voyaient entrer une personne qu’ils ne connaissent pas ? Ils me recevraient peut-être très mal ! dit la princesse.,Do you see those fine people if they see a person come in that they don't know?

They might make me feel quite unwelcome!” said the Princesse.,"Can't you see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into their house? Why, I might get a most hostile reception."" And she coquettishly enhanced the charm of the smile which the idea had brought to her lips, by giving to her blue eyes, which were fixed on the General, a gentle, dreamy expression."

Verdurin. “May the Lord preserve us from him, he is deadly dull, stupid, and ill-mannered.”","""I sincerely trust that we sha'n't!"" cried Mme. Verdurin.

Verdurin. “I don’t want to be made to weep till I get a cold in my head and neuralgia in my face, like the last time. Thanks for your offer, but I don’t intend to repeat that performance.

"Il arrivait encore parfois, quand, ayant rencontré Swann, elle voyait s’approcher d’elle quelqu’un qu’il ne connaissait pas, qu’il pût remarquer sur le visage d’Odette cette tristesse qu’elle avait eue le jour où il était venu pour la voir pendant que Forcheville était là. Mais c’était rare ; car les jours où malgré tout ce qu’elle avait à faire et la crainte de ce que penserait le monde, elle arrivait à voir Swann, ce qui dominait maintenant dans son attitude était l’assurance : grand contraste, peut-être revanche inconsciente ou réaction naturelle de l’émotion craintive qu’aux premiers temps où elle l’avait connu elle éprouvait auprès de lui, et même loin de lui, quand elle commençait une lettre par ces mots : « Mon ami, ma main tremble si fort que je peux à peine écrire » (elle le prétendait du moins, et un peu de cet émoi devait être sincère pour qu’elle désirât d’en feindre davantage). Swann lui plaisait alors. On ne tremble jamais que pour soi, que pour ceux qu’on aime. Quand notre bonheur n’est plus dans leurs mains, de quel calme, de quelle aisance, de quelle hardiesse on jouit auprès d’eux ! En lui parlant, en lui écrivant, elle n’avait plus de ces mots par lesquels elle cherchait à se donner l’illusion qu’il lui appartenait, faisant naître les occasions de dire « mon », « mien », quand il s’agissait de lui : « Vous êtes mon bien, c’est le parfum de notre amitié, je le garde », de lui parler de l’avenir, de la mort même, comme d’une seule chose pour eux deux. Dans ce temps-là, à tout de qu’il disait, elle répondait avec admiration : « Vous, vous ne serez jamais comme tout le monde » ; elle regardait sa longue tête un peu chauve, dont les gens qui connaissaient les succès de Swann pensaient : « Il n’est pas régulièrement beau si vous voulez, mais il est chic : ce toupet, ce monocle, ce sourire ! », et, plus curieuse peut-être de connaître ce qu’il était que désireuse d’être sa maîtresse, elle disait :","It still happened sometimes, when, having met Swann, she saw someone approach her whom he did not know, that he could notice on Odette's face that sadness which she had felt the day he had come to see her while Forcheville was there. But it was rare; because on the days when, despite everything she had to do and the fear of what the world would think, she managed to see Swann, what now dominated in her attitude was assurance: a great contrast, perhaps unconscious revenge or a natural reaction to the fearful emotion which when she first knew him she felt near him, and even far from him, when she began a letter with these words: ""My friend, my hand is shaking so much that I I can hardly write' (she pretended so at least, and some of this emotion must have been sincere for her to want to feign more of it). Swann pleased him then. We never tremble except for ourselves, only for those we love. When our happiness is no longer in their hands, what calm, what ease, what boldness we enjoy with them! Talking to him, writing to him, she no longer had those words with which she tried to give herself the illusion that he belonged to her, creating opportunities to say ""my"", ""mine"", when he was about him: ""You are my property, it's the perfume of our friendship, I'll keep it"", to speak to him of the future, of death itself, as of one thing for both of them. At that time, to everything he said, she answered with admiration: “You, you will never be like everyone else”; she looked at his long, somewhat bald head, of which people who knew Swann's successes thought: ""He is not regularly handsome if you like, but he is chic: that quill, that monocle, that smile!"" and, more curious perhaps to know what he was than desirous of being his mistress, she said:","It also sometimes happened that when, after meeting Swann, she saw some man approaching her whom he did not know, he could observe on Odette’s face the sadness she had shown the day he had come to see her while Forcheville was there. But this was rare; for on the days when, despite everything she had to do and her fear of what other people would think, she managed to see Swann, what now predominated in her attitude was self-assurance: a great contrast, perhaps an unconscious revenge or a natural reaction to the timorous emotion which, in the early days when she had known him, she had felt with him, and even far away from him, when she would begin a letter with these words: “My dear, my hand is shaking so hard I can scarcely write” (at least so she claimed, and a little of that emotion must have been sincere for her to want to feign more of it). She liked Swann then. We do not tremble except for ourselves, except for those we love. When our happiness is no longer in their hands, what calm, what ease, what boldness we enjoy in their company! When speaking to him, when writing to him, she no longer used any of those words with which she had sought to give herself the illusion that he belonged to her, creating occasions for saying “my,” “mine,” when she referred to him—“You are my property, this is the fragrance of our friendship, I’m keeping it”—and for talking to him about the future, about death even, as a single thing that would be shared by the two of them. In those days, to everything he said, she would answer admiringly: “You—you will never be like anyone else”; she would look at his long face, his slightly bald head, about which the people who knew of Swann’s successes with women would think: “He’s not conventionally handsome, granted, but he is smart: that quiff of hair, that monocle, that smile!” and, perhaps with more curiosity to know what he was than desire to become his mistress, she would say: “If only I could know what is in that head!”","It sometimes happened, again, that, when, after meeting Swann, she saw some man approaching whom he did not know, he could distinguish upon Odette's face that look of sorrow which she had worn on the day when he had come to her while Forcheville was there. But this was rare; for, on the days when, in spite of all that she had to do, and of her dread of what people would think, she did actually manage to see Swann, the predominant quality in her attitude, now, was self-assurance; a striking contrast, perhaps an unconscious revenge for, perhaps a natural reaction from the timorous emotion which, in the early days of their friendship, she had felt in his presence, and even in his absence, when she began a letter to him with the words: ""My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely write."" (So, at least, she pretended, and a little of that emotion must have been sincere, or she would not have been anxious to enlarge and emphasise it.) So Swann had been pleasing to her then. Our hands do not tremble except for ourselves, or for those whom we love. When they have ceased to control our happiness how peaceful, how easy, how bold do we become in their presence! In speaking to him, in writing to him now, she no longer employed those words by which she had sought to give herself the illusion that he belonged to her, creating opportunities for saying ""my"" and ""mine"" when she referred to him: "" You are all that I have in the world; it is the perfume of our friendship, I shall keep it,"" nor spoke to him of the future, of death itself, as of a single adventure which they would have to share. In those early days, whatever he might say to her, she would answer admiringly: ""You know, you will never be like other people!""—she would gaze at his long, slightly bald head, of which people who know only of his successes used to think: "" He's not regularly good-looking, if you like, but he is smart; that tuft, that eyeglass, that smile!"" and, with more curiosity perhaps to know him as he really was than desire to become his mistress, she would sigh:"
"Il n’allait chez elle que le soir, et il ne savait rien de l’emploi de son temps pendant le jour, pas plus que de son passé, au point qu’il lui manquait même ce petit renseignement initial qui, en nous permettant de nous imaginer ce que nous ne savons pas, nous donne envie de le connaître. Aussi ne se demandait-il pas ce qu’elle pouvait faire, ni quelle avait été sa vie. Il souriait seulement quelquefois en pensant qu’il y a quelques années, quand il ne la connaissait pas, on lui avait parlé d’une femme qui, s’il se rappelait bien, devait certainement être elle, comme d’une fille, d’une femme entretenue, une de ces femmes auxquelles il attribuait encore, comme il avait peu vécu dans leur société, le caractère entier, foncièrement pervers, dont les dota longtemps l’imagination de certains romanciers. Il se disait qu’il n’y a souvent qu’à prendre le contre-pied des réputations que fait le monde pour juger exactement une personne quand à un tel caractère il opposait celui d’Odette, bonne, naïve, éprise d’idéal, presque si incapable de ne pas dire la vérité, que l’ayant un jour priée, pour pouvoir dîner seul avec elle, d’écrire aux Verdurin qu’elle était souffrante, le lendemain, il l’avait vue, devant MmeVerdurin qui lui demandait si elle allait mieux, rougir, balbutier et refléter malgré elle, sur son visage, le chagrin, le supplice que cela lui était de mentir, et, tandis qu’elle multipliait dans sa réponse les détails inventés sur sa prétendue indisposition de la veille, avoir l’air de faire demander pardon par ses regards suppliants et sa voix désolée de la fausseté de ses paroles.","He only went to her house in the evening, and he knew nothing of her daytime use, nor of her past, to the point that he lacked even that little initial piece of information which, by allowing us imagining what we don't know makes us want to know it. So he didn't wonder what she could do, or what her life had been like. He only smiled sometimes thinking that a few years ago, when he didn't know her, he had been told about a woman who, if he remembered correctly, must have been her, like a girl. A kept woman, one of those women to whom he still attributed, as he had lived little in their society, the complete, fundamentally perverse character with which the imagination of certain novelists had long endowed them. He said to himself that it is often only necessary to take the opposite view of the reputations that the world makes to judge a person exactly when to such a character he opposed that of Odette, good, naive, in love with ideals. , almost so incapable of not telling the truth, that having asked her one day, in order to be able to dine alone with her, to write to the Verdurins that she was ill, the next day he had seen her, in front of Mme. asked if she was feeling better, blushing, stammering and reflecting in spite of herself, on her face, the grief, the torture it was for her to lie, and, while she multiplied in her answer the invented details about her alleged indisposition the day before , seeming to ask for forgiveness by his pleading looks and his voice sorry for the falseness of his words.","He went to her house only in the evening, and he knew nothing about how she spent her time during the day, any more than about her past, so much so that he lacked even that initial bit of information which, by allowing us to imagine for ourselves what we do not know, makes us want to know it. Thus, he did not ask himself what she might be doing, nor what sort of life she had had. He merely smiled sometimes at the thought that a few years before, when he did not know her, someone had spoken to him of a woman who, if he remembered rightly, must certainly have been she, as being a courtesan, a kept woman, one of those women to whom he still attributed, since he had spent very little time in their company, the willful, fundamentally perverse character with which they were for so long endowed by the imaginations of certain novelists. He would tell himself that often if one simply believes the opposite of the reputation the world has formed one will judge a person accurately, when he contrasted the character of such a woman with that of Odette, good, naive, enamored of idealism, so nearly incapable of not telling the truth that, after he begged her one day, so that he could have dinner alone with her, to write to the Verdurins telling them that she was unwell, the next day he had seen her, face-to-face with Mme. Verdurin, who was asking her if she felt better, blush, stammer, and reveal on her face despite herself what an affliction, what a torment it was for her to lie, and, while in her answer she multiplied the invented details of her alleged indisposition the day before, appear to be asking forgiveness, by her supplicating looks and her sorrowful voice, for the falseness of her words.","He went to her only in the evenings, and knew nothing of how she spent her time during the day, any more than he knew of her past; so little, indeed, that he had not even the tiny, initial clue which, by allowing us to imagine what we do not know, stimulates a desire foreknowledge. And so he never asked himself what she might be doing, or what her life had been. Only he smiled sometimes at the thought of how, some years earlier, when he still did not know her, some one had spoken to him of a woman who, if he remembered rightly, must certainly have been Odette, as of a 'tart,' a 'kept' woman, one of those women to whom he still attributed (having lived but little in their company) the entire set of characteristics, fundamentally perverse, with which they had been, for many years, endowed by the imagination of certain novelists. He would say to himself that one has, as often as not, only to take the exact counterpart of the reputation created by the world in order to judge a person fairly, when with such a character he contrasted that of Odette, so good, so simple, so enthusiastic in the pursuit of ideals, so nearly incapable of not telling the truth that, when he had once begged her, so that they might dine together alone, to write to Mme. Verdurin, saying that she was unwell, the next day he had seen her, face to face with Mme. Verdurin, who asked whether she had recovered, blushing, stammering, and, in spite of herself, revealing in every feature how painful, what a torture it was to her to act a lie; and, while in her answer she multiplied the fictitious details of an imaginary illness, seeming to ask pardon, by her suppliant look and her stricken accents, for the obvious falsehood of her words."

"Une fois dans les champs, on ne les quittait plus pendant tout le reste de la promenade qu’on faisait du côté de Méséglise. Ils étaient perpétuellement parcourus, comme par un chemineau invisible, par le vent qui était pour moi le génie particulier de Combray. Chaque année, le jour de notre arrivée, pour sentir que j’étais bien à Combray, je montais le retrouver qui courait dans les sayons et me faisait courir à sa suite. On avait toujours le vent à côté de soi du côté de Méséglise, sur cette plaine bombée où pendant des lieues il ne rencontre aucun accident de terrain. Je savais que Mlle Swann allait souvent à Laon passer quelques jours et, bien que ce fût à plusieurs lieues, la distance se trouvant compensée par l’absence de tout obstacle, quand, par les chauds après-midi, je voyais un même souffle, venu de l’extrême horizon, abaisser les blés les plus éloignés, se propager comme un flot sur toute l’immense étendue et venir se coucher, murmurant et tiède, parmi les sainfoins et les trèfles, à mes pieds, cette plaine qui nous était commune à tous deux semblait nous rapprocher, nous unir, je pensais que ce souffle avait passé auprès d’elle, que c’était quelque message d’elle qu’il me chuchotait sans que je pusse le comprendre, et je l’embrassais au passage. À gauche était un village qui s’appelait Champieu (Campus Pagani, selon le curé). Sur la droite, on apercevait par delà les blés les deux clochers ciselés et rustiques de Saint-André-des-Champs, eux-mêmes effilés, écailleux, imbriqués d’alvéoles, guillochés, jaunissants et grumeleux, comme deux épis.","Once in the fields, we did not leave them for the rest of the walk we made on the side of Méséglise. They were perpetually traversed, as by an invisible tramp, by the wind which was for me the particular genius of Combray. Every year, on the day of our arrival, to feel that I was at home in Combray, I went upstairs to find him running in the sayons and making me run after him. We always had the wind at our side near Méséglise, on this domed plain where for leagues there is no uneven ground. I knew that Miss Swann often went to Laon to spend a few days and, although it was several leagues away, the distance being compensated for by the absence of any obstacle, when, on hot afternoons, I saw the same breath, come from the extreme horizon, lower the most distant wheat, spread like a wave over the whole immense expanse and come to lie down, murmuring and warm, among the sainfoins and the clovers, at my feet, this plain which was common to both seemed to bring us closer, to unite us, I thought that this breath had passed near her, that it was some message from her that he was whispering to me without my being able to understand it, and I kissed her on the passage. To the left was a village called Champieu (Campus Pagani, according to the priest). On the right, one could see beyond the wheat the two chiselled and rustic steeples of Saint-André-des-Champs, themselves tapering, scaly, nested with cells, guilloché, yellowing and lumpy, like two ears of corn.","Once in the fields, we did not leave them again during the rest of our walk toward Méséglise. They were perpetually crossed, as though by an invisible vagabond, by the wind that was for me the presiding spirit of Combray. Each year, the day we arrived, in order to feel that I was really in Combray, I would go up to find it again where it ran along the furrows and made me run after it. We always had the wind beside us when we went the Méséglise way, over that cambered plain where for leagues it encounters no rise or fall in the land. I knew that Mlle. Swann often went to Laon to spend a few days, and even though it was several miles away, since the distance was compensated for by the absence of any obstacle, when, on hot afternoons, I saw a single gust of wind, coming from the farthest horizon, first bend the most distant wheat, then roll like a wave through all that vast expanse and come to lie down murmuring and warm among the sainfoin and clover at my feet, this plain which was shared by us both seemed to bring us together, join us, and I would imagine that this breath of wind had passed close beside her, that what it whispered to me was some message from her though I could not understand it, and I would kiss it as it went by. On the left was a village called Champieu (Campus pagani, according to the curé). To the right, you could see beyond the wheat the two chiseled rustic spires of Saint-André-des-Champs, themselves as tapering, scaly, imbricated, checkered, yellowing, and granulose as two spikes of wheat.","Once in the fields we never left them again during the rest of our Méséglise walk. They were perpetually crossed, as though by invisible streams of traffic, by the wind, which was to me the tutelary genius of Combray. Every year, on the day of our arrival, in order to feel that I really was at Combray, I would climb the hill to find it running again through my clothing, and setting me running in its wake. One always had the wind for companion when one went the 'Méséglise way,' on that swelling plain which stretched, mile beyond mile, without any disturbance of its gentle contour. I knew that Mlle. Swann used often to go and spend a few days at Laon, and, for all that it was many miles away, the distance was obviated by the absence of any intervening obstacle; when, on hot afternoons, I would see a breath of wind emerge from the farthest horizon, bowing the heads of the corn in distant fields, pouring like a flood over all that vast expanse, and finally settling down, warm and rustling, among the clover and sainfoin at my feet, that plain which was common to us both seemed then to draw us together, to unite us; I would imagine that the same breath had passed by her also, that there was some message from her in what it was whispering to me, without my being able to understand it, and I would catch and kiss it as it passed. On my left was a village called Champieu (Campus Pagani, according to the Curé). On my right I could see across the cornfields the two crocketed, rustic spires of Saint-André-des-Champs, themselves as tapering, scaly, plated, honeycombed, yellowed, and roughened as two ears of wheat."
"En tous cas Françoise attachait de plus en plus aux moindres paroles, aux moindres gestes de ma tante une attention extraordinaire. Quand elle avait quelque chose à lui demander, elle hésitait longtemps sur la manière dont elle devait s’y prendre. Et quand elle avait proféré sa requête, elle observait ma tante à la dérobée, tâchant de deviner dans l’aspect de sa figure ce que celle-ci avait pensé et déciderait. Et ainsi – tandis que quelque artiste lisant les Mémoires du XVIIe siècle, et désirant de se rapprocher du grand Roi, croit marcher dans cette voie en se fabriquant une généalogie qui le fait descendre d’une famille historique ou en entretenant une correspondance avec un des souverains actuels de l’Europe, tourne précisément le dos à ce qu’il a le tort de chercher sous des formes identiques et par conséquent mortes – une vieille dame de province qui ne faisait qu’obéir sincèrement à d’irrésistibles manies et à une méchanceté née de l’oisiveté, voyait sans avoir jamais pensé à Louis XIV les occupations les plus insignifiantes de sa journée, concernant son lever, son déjeuner, son repos, prendre par leur singularité despotique un peu de l’intérêt de ce que Saint-Simon appelait la « mécanique » de la vie à Versailles, et pouvait croire aussi que ses silences, une nuance de bonne humeur ou de hauteur dans sa physionomie, étaient de la part de Françoise l’objet d’un commentaire aussi passionné, aussi craintif que l’étaient le silence, la bonne humeur, la hauteur du Roi quand un courtisan, ou même les plus grands seigneurs, lui avaient remis une supplique, au détour d’une allée, à Versailles.","In any case Françoise attached more and more to the slightest words, to the slightest gestures of my aunt with extraordinary attention. When she had something to ask him, she hesitated for a long time on how she should go about it. And when she had uttered her request, she watched my aunt furtively, trying to guess from the look of her face what she had thought and would decide. And so – while some artist reading the Memoirs of the 17th century, and desiring to get closer to the great King, believes he is walking in this direction by creating a genealogy that makes him descend from a historical family or by maintaining a correspondence with one of the current sovereigns of Europe, turns his back precisely on what he is wrong to seek in identical and therefore dead forms – an old provincial lady who only sincerely obeyed irresistible manias and a wickedness born of idleness, saw without ever having thought of Louis XIV the most insignificant occupations of his day, concerning his getting up, his lunch, his rest, take by their despotic singularity a little of the interest of what Saint- Simon called the ""mechanics"" of life at Versailles, and could also believe that his silences, a hint of good humor or haughtiness in his countenance, were the subject of such passionate commentary on the part of Françoise. born, as fearful as the silence, the good humor, the haughtiness of the King were when a courtier, or even the greatest lords, had delivered a petition to him, at the bend of an alley, at Versailles.","Certainly Françoise came more and more to pay an extraordinary attention to the least of my aunt’s remarks, to the least of her gestures. When she had to ask her something, she would hesitate for a long time over how she should go about it. And when she had tendered her request, she would observe my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the look on her face what she thought and what she would decide. And so—while some artist who reads the memoirs of the seventeenth century and wants to be like the great King, and thinks he will be making progress in that direction if he fabricates a genealogy for himself that traces his own descent from a historic family or if he carries on a correspondence with one of the current sovereigns of Europe, is actually turning his back on what he mistakenly sought in forms that were identical and consequently dead—an old lady from the provinces who was simply yielding to irresistible manias and to a malice born of idleness, saw, without ever thinking of Louis XIV, the most insignificant occupations of her day, those concerned with her rising, her lunch, her afternoon rest, acquire, because of their despotic singularity, some of the interest of what Saint-Simon called the “mechanics” of life at Versailles,31 and could also believe that her silences, a nuance of good humor or disdain in her features, were for Françoise the object of a commentary as passionate, as fearful as were the silence, the good humor, the disdain of the King when a courtier, or even his greatest lords, handed him a petition at the bend of an avenue at Versailles.","However that might be, Françoise had come, more and more, to pay an infinitely scrupulous attention to my aunt's least word and gesture. When she had to ask her for anything she would hesitate, first, for a long time, making up her mind how best to begin. And when she had uttered her request, she would watch my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the expression on her face what she thought of it, and how she would reply. And in this way—whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the seventeenth century, and wished to bring himself nearer to the great Louis, would consider that he was making progress in that direction when he constructed a pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic family, or when he engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning Sovereigns of Europe, and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was making in seeking to establish a similarity by an exact and therefore lifeless copy of mere outward forms—a middle-aged lady in a small country town, by doing no more than yield whole-hearted obedience to her own irresistible eccentricities, and to a spirit of mischief engendered by the utter idleness of her existence, could see, without ever having given a thought to Louis XIV, the most trivial occupations of her daily life, her morning toilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap, assume, by virtue of their despotic singularity, something of the interest that was to be found in what Saint-Simon used to call the 'machinery' of life at Versailles; and was able, too, to persuade herself that her silence, a shade of good humour or of arrogance on her features, would provide Françoise with matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and terror, as did the silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the King when a courtier, or even his greatest nobles, had presented a petition to him, at the turning of an avenue, at Versailles."
"Françoise avait trop froid pour rester immobile, nous allâmes jusqu’au pont de la Concorde voir la Seine prise, dont chacun et même les enfants s’approchaient sans peur comme d’une immense baleine échouée, sans défense, et qu’on allait dépecer. Nous revenions aux Champs-Élysées ; je languissais de douleur entre les chevaux de bois immobiles et la pelouse blanche prise dans le réseau noir des allées dont on avait enlevé la neige, et sur laquelle la statue avait à la main un jet de glace ajouté qui semblait l’explication de son geste. La vieille dame elle-même, ayant plié ses Débats, demanda l’heure à une bonne d’enfants qui passait et qu’elle remercia en lui disant : « Comme vous êtes aimable ! » puis, priant le cantonnier de dire à ses petits enfants de revenir, qu’elle avait froid, ajouta : « Vous serez mille fois bon. Vous savez que je suis confuse ! » Tout à coup l’air se déchira : entre le guignol et le cirque, à l’horizon embelli, sur le ciel entr’ouvert, je venais d’apercevoir, comme un signe fabuleux, le plumet bleu de Mademoiselle. Et déjà Gilberte courait à toute vitesse dans ma direction, étincelante et rouge sous un bonnet carré de fourrure, animée par le froid, le retard et le désir du jeu ; un peu avant d’arriver à moi, elle se laissa glisser sur la glace et, soit pour mieux garder son équilibre, soit parce qu’elle trouvait cela plus gracieux, ou par affectation du maintien d’une patineuse, c’est les bras grands ouverts qu’elle avançait en souriant, comme si elle avait voulu m’y recevoir.","Françoise was too cold to stand still, we went as far as the Pont de la Concorde to see the Seine taken, which everyone and even the children approached without fear like an immense stranded whale, without defense, and which we were going to cut up. . We were returning to the Champs-Élysées; I languished in pain between the motionless wooden horses and the white lawn caught in the black network of paths from which the snow had been removed, and on which the statue had in its hand a jet of ice added which seemed to explain its gesture . The old lady herself, having folded her Débats, asked a passing nursemaid the time and thanked her, saying: “How kind you are! then, begging the road-mender to tell her grandchildren to come back, that she was cold, added: ""You will be a thousand times good."" You know I'm confused! Suddenly the air was torn: between the puppet and the circus, on the embellished horizon, against the half-open sky, I had just seen, like a fabulous sign, Mademoiselle's blue plume. And Gilberte was already running at full speed in my direction, sparkling and red under a square fur cap, animated by the cold, the delay and the desire to play; a little before reaching me, she let herself slide on the ice and, either to better keep her balance, or because she found it more graceful, or by affectation of the posture of a skater, it is the arms wide open she advanced, smiling, as if she wanted to receive me there.","Françoise was too cold to sit still; we walked to the pont de la Concorde to see the frozen Seine, which everyone including the children approached without fear as though it were a beached whale, immense, defenseless and about to be cut up. We returned to the Champs-Élysées; I was growing sick with misery between the motionless merry-go-round and the white lawn caught in the black web of paths from which the snow had been cleared and above which the statue had in its hand an added jet of ice which seemed to explain its gesture. Even the old lady, after folding her Débats, asked a passing nanny what time it was and thanked her by saying: “How kind of you!” then begged the man tending the paths to tell her grandchildren to come back, because she was cold, adding: “You are infinitely good. I am overwhelmed!” Suddenly the air was torn apart: between the puppet theater and the circus, on the clearing horizon, against the opening sky, I had just spied, as though it were a fabulous sign, Mademoiselle’s blue feather. And already Gilberte was running as fast as possible in my direction, sparkling and red under a square fur hat, animated by the cold, the lateness, and her desire to play; a little before reaching me, she let herself slide along the ice, and either to help keep her balance, or because she thought it more graceful, or pretending to move like a skater, her arms opened wide as she came forward smiling, as if she wanted to take me into them.","Françoise found it too cold to stand about, so we walked to the Pont de la Concorde to see the Seine frozen over, on to which everyone, even children, walked fearlessly, as though upon an enormous whale, stranded, defenceless, and about to be cut up. We returned to the Champs-Elysées; I was growing sick with misery between the motionless wooden horses and the white lawn, caught in a net of black paths from which the snow had been cleared, while the statue that surmounted it held in its hand a long pendent icicle which seemed to explain its gesture. The old lady herself, having folded up her Débats, asked a passing nursemaid the time, thanking her with ""How very good of you!"" then begged the road-sweeper to tell her grandchildren to come, as she felt cold, adding ""A thousand thanks. I am sorry to give you so much trouble!"" Suddenly the sky was rent in two: between the punch-and-judy and the horses, against the opening horizon, I had just seen, like a miraculous sign, Mademoiselle's blue feather. And now Gilberte was running at full speed towards me, sparkling and rosy beneath a cap trimmed with fur, enlivened by the cold, by being late, by her anxiety for a game; shortly before she reached me, she slipped on a piece of ice and, either to regain her balance, or because it appeared to her graceful, or else pretending that she was on skates, it was with outstretched arms that she smilingly advanced, as though to embrace me."
"– Comment, la princesse est venue exprès de Guermantes ? Mais c’est trop ! Je ne savais pas, je suis confuse, s’écria naïvement Mme de Saint-Euverte qui était peu habituée au tour d’esprit de Swann. Et examinant la coiffure de la princesse : Mais c’est vrai, cela imite…","""What, the princess came from Guermantes on purpose?"" But it's too much! I didn't know, I'm confused, exclaimed Madame de Saint-Euverte naively, who was unaccustomed to Swann's turn of mind.

The Princess came up on purpose from Guermantes? But that's too wonderful!

"Et M. Verdurin lui répondit : – Il n’est pas franc, c’est un monsieur cauteleux, toujours entre le zist et le zest. Il veut toujours ménager la chèvre et le chou. Quelle différence avec Forcheville ! Voilà au moins un homme qui vous dit carrément sa façon de penser. Ça vous plaît ou ça ne vous plaît pas. Ce n’est pas comme l’autre qui n’est jamais ni figue ni raisin. Du reste Odette a l’air de préférer joliment le Forcheville, et je lui donne raison. Et puis enfin, puisque Swann veut nous la faire à l’homme du monde, au champion des duchesses, au moins l’autre a son titre ; il est toujours comte de Forcheville, ajouta-t-il d’un air délicat, comme si, au courant de l’histoire de ce comté, il en soupesait minutieusement la valeur particulière.","And M. Verdurin replied: “He is not frank, he is a crafty gentleman, always between the zist and the zest. He always wants to spare the goat and the cabbage. What a difference with Forcheville! Here is at least one man who tells you his way of thinking bluntly. You like it or you don't. It is not like the other who is never neither fig nor grape. Besides, Odette seems to prefer the Forcheville nicely, and I agree with her. And then finally, since Swann wants to make it to us as the man of the world, as the champion of the duchesses, at least the other has his title; he is still Comte de Forcheville,” he added with a delicate air, as if, knowing the history of this county, he weighed minutely its particular value.","And M. Verdurin answered her: “He’s not direct, he’s cunning, always betwixt and between. He’s a fellow who’s always wanting to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. How different from Forcheville! There’s a man who at least tells you fair and square what he’s thinking. You either agree with him or you don’t. He’s not like the other, neither fish nor fowl. Anyway, Odette really seems to prefer Forcheville, and I think she’s right. And then, also, since Swann wants to play the society man with us, defender of duchesses, at least the other has his own title; he’s still the Comte de Forcheville,” he added delicately, as if, well informed about the history of that dignity, he was scrupulously weighing its particular value.","M. Verdurin took it up. "" He's not sincere. He's a crafty customer, always hovering between one side and the other. He's always trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. What a difference between him and Forcheville. There, at least, you have a man who tells you straight out what he thinks. Either you agree with him or you don't. Not like the other fellow, who's never definitely fish or fowl. Did you notice, by the way, that Odette seemed all out for Forcheville, and I don't blame her, either. And then, after all, if Swann tries to come the man of fashion over us, the champion of distressed Duchesses, at any rate the other man has got a title; he's always Comte de Forcheville!"" he let the words slip delicately from his lips, as though, familiar with every page of the history of that dignity, he were making a scrupulously exact estimate of its value, in relation to others of the sort."

"Je n’étais pas avec ma tante depuis cinq minutes, qu’elle me renvoyait par peur que je la fatigue.

"– Non, dit-elle, cher, vous savez que je suis habituée à celles que le grand-duc m’envoie. Je lui ai dit que vous en étiez jaloux. Et elle tira d’un étui des cigarettes couvertes d’inscriptions étrangères et dorées. « Mais si, reprit-elle tout d’un coup, je dois avoir rencontré chez vous le père de ce jeune homme. N’est-ce pas votre neveu ? Comment ai-je pu l’oublier ? Il a été tellement bon, tellement exquis pour moi », dit-elle d’un air modeste et sensible. Mais en pensant à ce qu’avait pu être l’accueil rude, qu’elle disait avoir trouvé exquis, de mon père, moi qui connaissais sa réserve et sa froideur, j’étais gêné, comme par une indélicatesse qu’il aurait commise, de cette inégalité entre la reconnaissance excessive qui lui était accordée et son amabilité insuffisante. Il m’a semblé plus tard que c’était un des côtés touchants du rôle de ces femmes oisives et studieuses, qu’elles consacrent leur générosité, leur talent, un rêve disponible de beauté sentimentale – car, comme les artistes, elles ne le réalisent pas, ne le font pas entrer dans le cadre de l’existence commune – et un or qui leur coûte peu, à enrichir d’un sertissage précieux et fin la vie fruste et mal dégrossie des hommes. Comme celle-ci, dans le fumoir où mon oncle était en vareuse pour la recevoir, répandait son corps si doux, sa robe de soie rose, ses perles, l’élégance qui émane de l’amitié d’un grand-duc, de même elle avait pris quelque propos insignifiant de mon père, elle l’avait travaillé avec délicatesse, lui avait donné un tour, une appellation précieuse et y enchâssant un de ses regards d’une si belle eau, nuancé d’humilité et de gratitude, elle le rendait changé en un bijou artiste, en quelque chose de « tout à fait exquis ».","“No,” she said, “my dear, you know I'm used to the ones the Grand Duke sends me. I told him you were jealous of him. And she took from a case cigarettes covered with foreign and gilded inscriptions. ""Yes,"" she resumed suddenly, ""I must have met that young man's father at your house. Isn't that your nephew? How could I forget it? He was so good, so exquisite for me,” she says modestly and sensitively. But thinking of what my father's harsh welcome, which she said she found exquisite, could have been, I who knew his reserve and his coldness, I was embarrassed, as if by an indelicacy he would have committed. , of this inequality between the excessive recognition which was granted to him and his insufficient kindness. It seemed to me later that it was one of the touching sides of the role of these idle and studious women, that they devote their generosity, their talent, an available dream of sentimental beauty – because, like artists, they do not do not realize, do not make it part of the framework of common existence – and a gold that costs them little, to enrich with a precious and fine setting the rough and rough-hewn life of men. Like this one, in the smoking room where my uncle was in a tunic to receive her, her soft body, her pink silk dress, her pearls, the elegance that emanates from the friendship of a Grand Duke, of she had even taken some insignificant remark from my father, she had worked on it with delicacy, had given it a turn, a precious appellation and enshrining in it one of her gazes of such beautiful water, nuanced with humility and gratitude, she made it changed into an artistic jewel, into something ""quite exquisite.""","“No,” she said, “my dear, you know I’ve become used to the ones the grand duke sends me. I told him you were jealous.” And from a case she drew cigarettes covered with gilded foreign writing. “Why yes,” she added abruptly, “I must have met this young man’s father at your house. Isn’t he your nephew? How could I have forgotten? He was so good, so exquisite to me,” she said modestly and sensitively. But as I thought about what might have been my father’s brusque greeting which she had found so exquisite, I, who knew his reserve and his coldness, was embarrassed, as by an indelicacy he had committed, by this disparity between the excessive gratitude that was bestowed on it and his insufficient cordiality. It seemed to me later that it was one of the touching aspects of the role of these idle and studious women that they devote their generosity, their talent, a free-floating dream of beauty in love—for, like artists, they do not carry it to fruition, do not bring it into the framework of a shared existence—and a gold that costs them little, to enrich with a precious and refined setting the rough and ill-polished lives of men. Just as this one, in the smoking room where my uncle was wearing his plain jacket to receive her, generously diffused her soft and sweet body, her dress of pink silk, her pearls, the elegance that emanates from the friendship of a grand duke, so in the same way she had taken some insignificant remark of my father’s, had worked it delicately, turned it, given it a precious appellation, and enchasing it with one of her glances of the finest water, tinged with humility and gratitude, had given it back changed into an artistic jewel, into something “completely exquisite.”","""No, thank you, dear friend,"" she said. ""You know I only smoke the ones the Grand Duke sends me. I tell him that they make you jealous."" And she drew from a case cigarettes covered with inscriptions in gold, in a foreign language. ""Why, yes,"" she began again suddenly. ""Of course I have met this young man's father with you. Isn't he your nephew? How on earth could I have forgotten? He was so nice, so charming to me,"" she went on, modestly and with feeling. But when I thought to myself what must actually have been the rude greeting (which, she made out, had been so charming), I, who knew my father's coldness and reserve, was shocked, as though at some indelicacy on his part, at the contrast between the excessive recognition bestowed on it and his never adequate geniality. It has since struck me as one of the most touching aspects of the part played in life by these idle, painstaking women that they devote all their generosity, all their talent, their transferable dreams of sentimental beauty (for, like all artists, they never seek to realise the value of those dreams, or to enclose them in the four-square frame of everyday life), and their gold, which counts for little, to the fashioning of a fine and precious setting for the rubbed and scratched and ill-polished lives of men. And just as this one filled the smoking-room, where my uncle was entertaining her in his alpaca coat, with her charming person, her dress of pink silk, her pearls, and the refinement suggested by intimacy with a Grand Duke, so, in the same way, she had taken some casual remark by my father, had worked it up delicately, given it a 'turn,' a precious title, set in it the gem of a glance from her own eyes, a gem of the first water, blended of humility and gratitude; and so had given it back transformed into a jewel, a work of art, into something altogether charming."
"– Enfin, s’il n’y a rien, je ne pense pas que ce soit que ce monsieur la croit vertueuse, dit ironiquement M.","“Well, if there is nothing, I do not think it is that this gentleman believes her to be virtuous,” said Mr.","“Anyway, if there’s nothing going on, I don’t think it’s because the gentleman thinks she’s virtuous,” M.

"Mais il n’entrait jamais chez elle. Deux fois seulement, dans l’après-midi, il était allé participer à cette opération capitale pour elle, « prendre le thé ». L’isolement et le vide de ces courtes rues (faites presque toutes de petits hôtels contigus, dont tout à coup venait rompre la monotonie quelque sinistre échoppe, témoignage historique et reste sordide du temps où ces quartiers étaient encore mal famés), la neige qui était restée dans le jardin et aux arbres, le négligé de la saison, le voisinage de la nature, donnaient quelque chose de plus mystérieux à la chaleur, aux fleurs qu’il avait trouvées en entrant.","But he never came to her house.

The isolation and emptiness of these short streets (almost all made up of small adjoining hotels, the monotony of which was suddenly broken by some sinister shop, historical testimony and sordid remains of the time when these quarters were still in bad repute), the snow which had remained in the garden and the trees, the negligence of the season, the neighborhood of nature, gave something more mysterious to the warmth, to the flowers he had found on entering.","But he never went into her house. Only twice, he had gone there in the afternoon to participate in that operation which was of such capital importance for her: “having tea.” The isolation and emptiness of the short streets (almost all of them lined with small contiguous private houses, whose monotony would suddenly be interrupted by some sinister street stall, the historic sign and sordid vestige of a time when these districts were still in bad repute), the snow lingering in the garden and on the trees, the slovenliness of the season, the proximity of nature, lent something more mysterious to the warmth, the flowers that he had found when he went in.","He would escort her to her gate, but no farther. Twice only had he gone inside to take part in the ceremony—of such vital importance in her life—of 'afternoon tea.'

"Elle alléguait qu’elle était obligée d’attendre une réponse de la plus haute importance pour elle, et même si, après qu’elle avait fait venir Swann, des amis demandaient à Odette, quand la soirée était déjà commencée, de les rejoindre au théâtre ou à souper, elle faisait un bond joyeux et s’habillait à la hâte. Au fur et à mesure qu’elle avançait dans sa toilette, chaque mouvement qu’elle faisait rapprochait Swann du moment où il faudrait la quitter, où elle s’enfuirait d’un élan irrésistible ; et quand, enfin prête, plongeant une dernière fois dans son miroir ses regards tendus et éclairés par l’attention, elle remettait un peu de rouge à ses lèvres, fixait une mèche sur son front et demandait son manteau de soirée bleu ciel avec des glands d’or, Swann avait l’air si triste qu’elle ne pouvait réprimer un geste d’impatience et disait : « Voilà comme tu me remercies de t’avoir gardé jusqu’à la dernière minute. Moi qui croyais avoir fait quelque chose de gentil. C’est bon à savoir pour une autre fois ! »","She alleged that she was obliged to wait for an answer of the utmost importance to her, and even if, after she had summoned Swann, friends asked Odette, when the evening had already begun, to join them at the theater or supper, she jumped joyfully and dressed hastily. As she advanced in her toilet, each movement she made brought Swann closer to the moment when he would have to leave her, when she would flee with an irresistible impulse; and when, finally ready, plunging her gaze tense and enlightened by attention into her mirror one last time, she put a little lipstick back on her lips, fixed a lock on her forehead and asked for her sky-blue evening coat with tassels d'or, Swann looked so sad that she could not repress a gesture of impatience and said: ""Here is how you thank me for having kept you until the last minute. Me who thought I had done something nice. Good to know for another time! »","She would maintain that she had to wait for an answer of the greatest importance, and if after she had sent for Swann friends asked her, when the evening had already begun, to meet them at the theater or at supper, she would give a joyful leap into the air and dress quickly.

And I thought I was being nice. I’ll know better next time!”","She would plead that she was obliged to wait for an answer which was of the very greatest importance, and if, even after she had made Swann come to her house, any of her friends asked her, half-way through the evening, to join them at some theatre, or at supper afterwards, she would jump for joy and dress herself with all speed. As her toilet progressed, every movement that she made brought Swann nearer to the moment when he would have to part from her, when she would fly off with irresistible force; and when at length she was ready, and, Plunging into her mirror a last glance strained and brightened by her anxiety to look well, smeared a little salve on her lips, fixed a stray loci of hair over her brow, and called for her cloak of sky-blue silk with golden tassels, Swann would be looking so wretched that she would be unable to restrain a gesture of impatience as she flung at him: ""So that is how you thank me for keeping you here till the last minute! And I thought I was being so nice to you. Well, I shall know better another time!"""
"Et sans doute cela n’était pas vrai. Mais Swann et la princesse avaient une même manière de juger les petites choses qui avait pour effet – à moins que ce ne fût pour cause – une grande analogie dans la façon de s’exprimer et jusque dans la prononciation. Cette ressemblance ne frappait pas parce que rien n’était plus différent que leurs deux voix. Mais si on parvenait par la pensée à ôter aux propos de Swann la sonorité qui les enveloppait, les moustaches d’entre lesquelles ils sortaient, on se rendait compte que c’étaient les mêmes phrases, les mêmes inflexions, le tour de la coterie Guermantes. Pour les choses importantes, Swann et la princesse n’avaient les mêmes idées sur rien. Mais depuis que Swann était si triste, ressentant toujours cette espèce de frisson qui précède le moment où l’on va pleurer, il avait le même besoin de parler du chagrin qu’un assassin a de parler de son crime. En entendant la princesse lui dire que la vie était une chose affreuse, il éprouva la même douceur que si elle lui avait parlé d’Odette.","And that was probably not true. But Swann and the princess had the same way of judging little things, which had the effect—if not for cause—of a great analogy in the manner of expression and even in pronunciation. This resemblance was not striking because nothing was more different than their two voices. But if one managed by thought to remove from Swann's remarks the sonority which enveloped them, the mustaches from between which they emerged, one realized that it was the same phrases, the same inflections, the turn of the Guermantes coterie. . When it comes to important things, Swann and the princess had the same ideas about nothing. But since Swann was so sad, always feeling that kind of shiver which precedes the moment when one is about to cry, he had the same need to speak of the grief that an assassin has to speak of his crime. Hearing the princess tell him that life was a dreadful thing, he felt the same sweetness as if she had spoken to him about Odette.","This was probably not true. But Swann and the Princesse had the same way of looking at the small things of life, the effect of which—unless it was the cause—was a great similarity in their ways of expressing themselves and even in their pronunciation. No one noticed the resemblance because their two voices were so utterly unlike. But if in one’s imagination one managed to divest Swann’s remarks of the sonority in which they were enveloped, of the mustache from under which they issued, one realized that these were the same sentences, the same inflections, that these turns of phrase belonged to the Guermantes set. When it came to the important things, Swann and the Princesse did not have the same ideas about anything. But now that Swann had become so sad, always in the sort of tremulous condition that precedes the moment one is going to cry, he felt as compelled to talk about grief as a murderer is to talk about his crime. When he heard the Princesse say that life was a dreadful thing, he felt as comforted as if she had been talking about Odette.","Which was probably not true. But Swann and the Princess had the same way of looking at the little things of life— the effect, if not the cause of which was a close analogy between their modes of expression and even of pronunciation. This similarity was not striking because no two things could have been more unlike than their voices. But if one took the trouble to imagine Swann's utterances divested of the sonority that enwrapped them, of the moustache from under which they emerged, one found that they were the same phrases, the same inflexions, that they had the 'tone' of the Guermantes set. On important matters, Swann and the Princess had not an idea in common. But since Swann had become so melancholy, and was always in that trembling condition which precedes a flood of tears, he had the same need to speak about his grief that a murderer has to tell some one about his crime. And when he heard the Princess say that life was a dreadful business, he felt as much comforted as if she had spoken to him of Odette."

"Tout d’un coup pendant la messe de mariage, un mouvement que fit le suisse en se déplaçant me permit de voir assise dans une chapelle une dame blonde avec un grand nez, des yeux bleus et perçants, une cravate bouffante en soie mauve, lisse, neuve et brillante, et un petit bouton au coin du nez. Et parce que dans la surface de son visage rouge, comme si elle eût eu très chaud, je distinguais, diluées et à peine perceptibles, des parcelles d’analogie avec le portrait qu’on m’avait montré, parce que surtout les traits particuliers que je relevais en elle, si j’essayais de les énoncer, se formulaient précisément dans les mêmes termes : un grand nez, des yeux bleus, dont s’était servi le docteur Percepied quand il avait décrit devant moi la duchesse de Guermantes, je me dis : cette dame ressemble à Mme de Guermantes ; or la chapelle où elle suivait la messe était celle de Gilbert le Mauvais, sous les plates tombes de laquelle, dorées et distendues comme des alvéoles de miel, reposaient les anciens comtes de Brabant, et que je me rappelais être, à ce qu’on m’avait dit, réservée à la famille de Guermantes quand quelqu’un de ses membres venait pour une cérémonie à Combray ; il ne pouvait vraisemblablement y avoir qu’une seule femme ressemblant au portrait de Mme de Guermantes, qui fût ce jour-là, jour où elle devait justement venir, dans cette chapelle : c’était elle ! Ma déception était grande. Elle provenait de ce que je n’avais jamais pris garde, quand je pensais à Mme de Guermantes, que je me la représentais avec les couleurs d’une tapisserie ou d’un vitrail, dans un autre siècle, d’une autre matière que le reste des personnes vivantes. Jamais je ne m’étais avisé qu’elle pouvait avoir une figure rouge, une cravate mauve comme MmeSazerat, et l’ovale de ses joues me fit tellement souvenir de personnes que j’avais vues à la maison que le soupçon m’effleura, pour se dissiper d’ailleurs aussitôt après, que cette dame en son principe générateur, en toutes ses molécules, n’était peut-être pas substantiellement la duchesse de Guermantes, mais que son corps, ignorant du nom qu’on lui appliquait, appartenait à un certain type féminin, qui comprenait aussi des femmes de médecins et de commerçants. « C’est cela, ce n’est que cela, Mme de Guermantes ! » disait la mine attentive et étonnée avec laquelle je contemplais cette image qui, naturellement, n’avait aucun rapport avec celles qui sous le même nom de Mme de Guermantes étaient apparues tant de fois dans mes songes, puisque, elle, elle n’avait pas été comme les autres arbitrairement formée par moi, mais qu’elle m’avait sauté aux yeux pour la première fois, il y a un moment seulement, dans l’église ; qui n’était pas de la même nature, n’était pas colorable à volonté comme elles qui se laissaient imbiber de la teinte orangée d’une syllabe, mais était si réelle que tout, jusqu’à ce petit bouton qui s’enflammait au coin du nez, certifiait son assujettissement aux lois de la vie, comme dans une apothéose de théâtre, un plissement de la robe de la fée, un tremblement de son petit doigt, dénoncent la présence matérielle d’une actrice vivante, là où nous étions incertains si nous n’avions pas devant les yeux une simple projection lumineuse.","Suddenly during the wedding mass, a movement that the Swiss made while moving allowed me to see seated in a chapel a blonde lady with a large nose, piercing blue eyes, a puffy mauve silk tie, smooth , new and shiny, and a small pimple at the corner of the nose. And because in the surface of her red face, as if she were very warm, I distinguished, diluted and barely perceptible, bits of analogy with the portrait that I had been shown, because above all the particular features that I noted in her, if I tried to state them, were formulated in precisely the same terms: a large nose, blue eyes, which Doctor Percepied had used when he had described the Duchesse de Guermantes to me, I say to myself: this lady resembles Madame de Guermantes; now the chapel where she followed the mass was that of Gilbert le Mauvais, under the flat tombs of which, gilded and distended like cells of honey, rested the former counts of Brabant, and whom I remembered to be, so that one had told me, reserved for the Guermantes family when one of its members came for a ceremony at Combray; there could probably only be one woman resembling the portrait of Madame de Guermantes, who was on that day, the day on which she was just to come, in this chapel: it was she! My disappointment was great. It came from the fact that I had never taken care, when I thought of Madame de Guermantes, that I represented her to myself with the colors of a tapestry or a stained glass window, in another century, of a material other than the rest of the living people. It had never occurred to me that she could have a red face, a mauve tie like Madame Sazerat, and the oval of her cheeks reminded me so much of people I had seen at home that suspicion crossed my mind, to dissipate moreover immediately afterwards, that this lady in her generative principle, in all her molecules, was perhaps not substantially the Duchesse de Guermantes, but that her body, ignorant of the name applied to it, belonged to a certain feminine type, which also included doctors' and shopkeepers' wives. ""That's it, it's only that, Madame de Guermantes! said the attentive and astonished expression with which I contemplated this image which, naturally, had no connection with those which under the same name of Madame de Guermantes had appeared so many times in my dreams, since she had no not like the others arbitrarily formed by me, but that it had first struck me only a moment ago in the church; which was not of the same nature, was not colorable at will like them which allowed themselves to be soaked in the orange hue of a syllable, but was so real that everything, down to this little button which ignited at the corner of the nose, certifying his subjection to the laws of life, as in a theatrical apotheosis, a wrinkling of the fairy's dress, a trembling of her little finger, denounce the material presence of a living actress, where we were uncertain if we did not have in front of our eyes a simple luminous projection.","Suddenly during the wedding service, a movement made by the verger as he shifted his position allowed me to see, sitting in a chapel, a blond lady with a large nose, piercing blue eyes, a full tie of smooth, shiny, new mauve silk, and a little pimple at the corner of her nose. And because on the surface of her face, which was red, as though she were very warm, I could distinguish bits of resemblance, diluted and barely perceptible, to the picture I had been shown, especially because the particular features that I observed in her, if I tried to enunciate them, were formulated in exactly the same words—a large nose, blue eyes—which Dr. Percepied had used when he described the Duchesse de Guermantes in my presence, I said to myself: “That lady looks like Mme. de Guermantes”; now the chapel where she was attending Mass was that of Gilbert the Bad, under the flat tombstones of which, golden and distended like cells of honey, rested the former counts of Brabant, and which, I recalled, was reserved, according to what I had been told, for the Guermantes family when any one of its members came to Combray for a ceremony; there probably could not be more than one woman who resembled Mme. de Guermantes’s picture, who on that day, the very day when she was in fact supposed to come, was in that chapel: it was she! I was very disappointed. My disappointment came from the fact that I had never noticed, when I thought of Mme. de Guermantes, that I was picturing her to myself in the colors of a tapestry or a stained-glass window, in another century, of a material different from that of other living people. I had never realized that she might have a red face, a mauve tie like Mme. Sazerat, and the oval of her cheeks reminded me so much of people I had seen at our house that the suspicion touched me, dissipating immediately, however, that this lady, in her generative principle, in all her molecules, was perhaps not essentially the Duchesse de Guermantes, that instead, her body, unaware of the name applied to it, belonged to a certain female type that also included the wives of doctors and shopkeepers. “So that’s Mme. de Guermantes— that’s what she is, that’s all she is!” said the attentive and astonished expression with which I contemplated an image of course quite unrelated to those which under the same name of Mme.","Suddenly, during the nuptial mass, the beadle, by moving to one side, enabled me to see, sitting in a chapel, a lady with fair hair and a large nose, piercing blue eyes, a billowy scarf of mauve silk, glossy and new and brilliant, and a little spot at the corner of her nose. And because on the surface of her face, which was red, as though she had been very warm, I could make out, diluted and barely perceptible, details which resembled the portrait that had been shewn to me; because, more especially, the particular features which I remarked in this lady, if I attempted to catalogue them, formulated themselves in precisely the same terms:—a large nose, blue eyes, as Dr. Percepied had used when describing in my presence the Duchesse de Guermantes, I said to myself: ""This lady is like the Duchesse de Guermantes. "" Now the chapel from which she was following the service was that of Gilbert the Bad; beneath its flat tombstones, yellowed and bulging like cells of honey in a comb, rested the bones of the old Counts of Brabant; and I remembered having heard it said that this chapel was reserved for the Guermantes family, whenever any of its members came to attend a ceremony at Combray; there was, indeed, but one woman resembling the portrait of Mme. de Guermantes who on that day, the very day on which she was expected to come there, could be sitting in that chapel: it was she! My disappointment was immense. It arose from my not having borne in mind, when I thought of Mme. de Guermantes, that I was picturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a painted window, as living in another century, as being of another substance than the rest of the human race. Never had I taken into account that she might have a red face, a mauve scarf like Mme. Sazerat; and the oval curve of her cheeks reminded me so strongly of people whom I had seen at home that the suspicion brushed against my mind (though it was immediately banished) that this lady in her creative principle, in the molecules of her physical composition, was perhaps not substantially the Duchesse de Guermantes, but that her body, in ignorance of the name that people had given it, belonged to a certain type of femininity which included, also, the wives of doctors and tradesmen. ""It is, it must be Mme. de Guermantes, and no one else!"" were the words underlying the attentive and astonished expression with which I was gazing upon this image, which, naturally enough, bore no resemblance to those that had so often, under the same title of 'Mme. de Guermantes,' appeared to me in dreams, since this one had not been, like the others, formed arbitrarily by myself, but had sprung into sight for the first time, only a moment ago, here in church; an image which was not of the same nature, was not colourable at will, like those others that allowed themselves to imbibe the orange tint of a sonorous syllable, but which was so real that everything, even to the fiery little spot at the corner of her nose, gave an assurance of her subjection to the laws of life, as in a transformation scene on the stage a crease in the dress of a fairy, a quivering of her tiny finger, indicate the material presence of a living actress before our eyes, whereas we were uncertain, till then, whether we were not looking merely at a projection of limelight from a lantern."

"Ainsi il n’y avait sans doute pas, dans tout le milieu Verdurin, un seul fidèle qui les aimât ou crût les aimer autant que Swann. Et pourtant, quand M. Verdurin avait dit que Swann ne lui revenait pas, non seulement il avait exprimé sa propre pensée, mais il avait deviné celle de sa femme. Sans doute Swann avait pour Odette une affection trop particulière et dont il avait négligé de faire de MmeVerdurin la confidente quotidienne ; sans doute la discrétion même avec laquelle il usait de l’hospitalité des Verdurin, s’abstenant souvent de venir dîner pour une raison qu’ils ne soupçonnaient pas et à la place de laquelle ils voyaient le désir de ne pas manquer une invitation chez des « ennuyeux », sans doute aussi, et malgré toutes les précautions qu’il avait prises pour la leur cacher, la découverte progressive qu’ils faisaient de sa brillante situation mondaine, tout cela contribuait à leur irritation contre lui. Mais la raison profonde en était autre. C’est qu’ils avaient très vite senti en lui un espace réservé, impénétrable, où il continuait à professer silencieusement pour lui-même que la princesse de Sagan n’était pas grotesque et que les plaisanteries de Cottard n’étaient pas drôles, enfin et bien que jamais il ne se départît de son amabilité et ne se révoltât contre leurs dogmes, une impossibilité de les lui imposer, de l’y convertir entièrement, comme ils n’en avaient jamais rencontré une pareille chez personne. Ils lui auraient pardonné de fréquenter des ennuyeux (auxquels d’ailleurs, dans le fond de son cœur, il préférait mille fois les Verdurin et tout le petit noyau) s’il avait consenti, pour le bon exemple, à les renier en présence des fidèles. Mais c’est une abjuration qu’ils comprirent qu’on ne pourrait pas lui arracher.","Thus there was probably not, in all Verdurin circles, a single devotee who loved them or thought he loved them as much as Swann. And yet, when M. Verdurin had said that Swann was not his, not only had he expressed his own thought, but he had divined that of his wife. Doubtless Swann had too particular an affection for Odette and of which he had neglected to make Madame Verdurin the daily confidante; doubtless the very discretion with which he used the hospitality of the Verdurins, often abstaining from coming to dinner for a reason which they did not suspect and in the place of which they saw the desire not to miss an invitation to ""boring,"" no doubt too, and despite all the precautions he had taken to hide it from them, the gradual discovery they were making of his brilliant social position, all this contributed to their irritation with him. But the underlying reason was different. They had very quickly sensed in him a reserved, impenetrable space, where he continued to profess silently to himself that the Princess of Sagan was not grotesque and that Cottard's jokes were not funny, finally, and although he never departed from his friendliness and revolted against their dogmas, an impossibility of imposing them on him, of converting him to them entirely, such as they had never encountered such in anyone. They would have forgiven him for frequenting boring people (to whom, moreover, in the bottom of his heart, he a thousand times preferred the Verdurins and all the little nucleus) if he had consented, for the good example, to disown them in the presence of faithful. But it was an abjuration which they understood could not be wrested from him.","And so there was probably not, in the whole Verdurin circle, a single faithful partisan who liked them or thought he liked them as much as did Swann. And yet, when M. Verdurin had said he did not much care for Swann, he was not only expressing his own thoughts, but also guessing his wife’s. Doubtless Swann’s affection for Odette was too private and he had neglected to make Mme. Verdurin his daily confidante concerning it; doubtless the very discretion with which he had made use of the Verdurins’ hospitality, often refraining from coming to dinner for a reason that they did not suspect and in place of which they saw a desire not to turn down an invitation to the home of some “bores”; doubtless, too, and despite all the precautions he had taken to hide it from them, their gradual discovery of his brilliant position in society, all fed their irritation with him. But the deeper reason for it was different. It was that they had very quickly sensed in him a reserved, impenetrable space where he continued to profess silently to himself that the Princesse de Sagan was not grotesque and that Cottard’s jokes were not funny, in the end, and, even though he never deviated from his affability and never rebelled against their dogmas, they sensed, too, an impossibility of imposing them on him, of wholly converting him to them, the likes of which they had never encountered before in anyone. They would have forgiven him for associating with bores (to whom, for that matter, in his heart of hearts, he preferred the Verdurins and the whole of the little clan a thousand times over), if he had consented, as a good example, to renounce them in the presence of the faithful. But this was an abjuration they understood could not be wrung from him.","And so there was probably not, in the whole of the Verdurin circle, a single one of the 'faithful' who loved them, or believed that he loved them, as dearly as did Swann. And yet, when M. Verdurin said that he was not satisfied with Swann, he had not only expressed his own sentiments, he had unwittingly discovered his wife's. Doubtless Swann had too particular an affection for Odette, as to which he had failed to take Mme. Verdurin daily into his confidence; doubtless the very discretion with which he availed himself of the Verdurins' hospitality, refraining, often, from coming to dine with them for a reason which they never suspected, and in place of which they saw only an anxiety on his part not to have to decline an invitation to the house of some 'bore' or other; doubtless, also, and despite all the precautions which he had taken to keep it from them, the gradual discovery which they were making of his brilliant position in society—doubtless all these things contributed to their general annoyance with Swann. But the real, the fundamental reason was quite different. What had happened was that they had at once discovered in him a locked door, a reserved, impenetrable chamber in which he still professed silently to himself that the Princesse de Sagan was not grotesque, and that Cottard's jokes were not amusing; in a word (and for all that he never once abandoned his friendly attitude towards them all, or revolted from their dogmas), they had discovered an impossibility of imposing those dogmas upon him, of entirely converting him to their faith, the like of which they had never come across in anyone before. They would have forgiven his going to the houses of 'bores' (to whom, as it happened, in his heart of hearts he infinitely preferred the Verdurins and all their little 'nucleus') had he consented to set a good example by openly renouncing those 'bores' in the presence of the 'faithful.' But that was an abjuration which, as they well knew, they were powerless to extort."

"Si, quand son petit-fils était un peu enrhumé du cerveau, elle partait la nuit, même malade, au lieu de se coucher, pour voir s’il n’avait besoin de rien, faisant quatre lieues à pied avant le jour afin d’être rentrée pour son travail, en revanche ce même amour des siens et son désir d’assurer la grandeur future de sa maison se traduisait dans sa politique à l’égard des autres domestiques par une maxime constante qui fut de n’en jamais laisser un seul s’implanter chez ma tante, qu’elle mettait d’ailleurs une sorte d’orgueil à ne laisser approcher par personne, préférant, quand elle-même était malade, se relever pour lui donner son eau de Vichy plutôt que de permettre l’accès de la chambre de sa maîtresse à la fille de cuisine. Et comme cet hyménoptère observé par Fabre, la guêpe fouisseuse, qui pour que ses petits après sa mort aient de la viande fraîche à manger, appelle l’anatomie au secours de sa cruauté et, ayant capturé des charançons et des araignées, leur perce avec un savoir et une adresse merveilleux le centre nerveux d’où dépend le mouvement des pattes, mais non les autres fonctions de la vie, de façon que l’insecte paralysé près duquel elle dépose ses œufs, fournisse aux larves, quand elles écloront un gibier docile, inoffensif, incapable de fuite ou de résistance, mais nullement faisandé, Françoise trouvait pour servir sa volonté permanente de rendre la maison intenable à tout domestique, des ruses si savantes et si impitoyables que, bien des années plus tard, nous apprîmes que si cet été-là nous avions mangé presque tous les jours des asperges, c’était parce que leur odeur donnait à la pauvre fille de cuisine chargée de les éplucher des crises d’asthme d’une telle violence qu’elle fut obligée de finir par s’en aller.","If, when her grandson had a bit of a cold in the brain, she left at night, even when ill, instead of going to bed, to see if he needed anything, walking four leagues before daylight in order to Having returned to work, on the other hand, this same love of his family and his desire to ensure the future greatness of his house was reflected in his policy with regard to other servants by a constant maxim which was never to leave any. one only to set up shop with my aunt, whom, moreover, she took a kind of pride in not letting anyone approach, preferring, when she herself was ill, to get up to give her her Vichy water rather than allowing access from his mistress's bedroom to the kitchen maid. And like the wasp observed by Fabre, the digger wasp, which so that its young after its death have fresh meat to eat, calls on anatomy to help in its cruelty and, having captured weevils and spiders, pierces them with marvelous knowledge and skill the nerve center on which depends the movement of the legs, but not the other functions of life, so that the paralyzed insect near which it lays its eggs, provides the larvae, when they hatch, with game docile, inoffensive, incapable of flight or resistance, but in no way gamey, Françoise found, in order to serve her permanent will to make the house untenable for any servant, such skilful and pitiless tricks that, many years later, we learned that if that summer we had eaten asparagus almost every day, it was because their smell gave the poor kitchen girl in charge of peeling them such violent asthma attacks that she was obliged to eventually go away.","33 Although when her grandson had a little cold in the head she would set off at night even if she was ill, instead of going to bed, to see if he needed anything, covering four leagues on foot before daybreak in order to be back in time to do her work, this same love of her own people and her desire to ensure the future greatness of her house was expressed, in her policy toward the other servants, by a consistent principle, which was never to let a single one of them become attached to my aunt, whom she took, moreover, a sort of pride in not allowing to be approached by anyone, preferring, when she herself was ill, to get up out of bed in order to give her mistress her Vichy water rather than permit the kitchen maid access to the bedroom. And like the hymenopteran observed by Fabre,34 the burrowing wasp who, so that its young may have fresh meat to eat after its death, summons anatomy in aid of its cruelty and, after capturing a few weevils and spiders, proceeds with a marvelous knowledge and skill to pierce them in the nerve center that governs the movement of their legs but not their other life functions, in such a way that the paralyzed insect near which it deposits its eggs provides the larvae, when they hatch, with prey that is docile, harmless, incapable of flight or resistance, but not in the least tainted, Françoise found, to serve her abiding desire to make the house intolerable to any other servant, ruses so clever and so merciless that many years later we learned that if we had eaten asparagus almost every day that summer, it was because their smell provoked in the poor kitchen girl who was given the job of scraping them attacks of asthma so violent that she was obliged in the end to leave.","Although, when her grandson had a slight cold in his head, she would Bet off at night, even if she were ill also, instead of going to bed, to see whether he had everything that he wanted, covering ten miles on foot before daybreak so as to be in time to begin her work, this same love for her own people, and her desire to establish the future greatness of her house on a solid foundation reacted, in her policy with regard to the other servants, in one unvarying maxim, which was never to let any of them set foot in my aunt's room; indeed she shewed a sort of pride in not allowing anyone else to come near my aunt, preferring, when she herself was ill, to get out of bed and to administer the Vichy water in person, rather than to concede to the kitchen-maid the right of entry into her mistress's presence. There is a species of hymenoptera, observed by Fabre, the burrowing wasp, which in order to provide a supply of fresh meat for her offspring after her own decease, calls in the science of anatomy to amplify the resources of her instinctive cruelty, and, having made a collection of weevils and spiders, proceeds with marvellous knowledge and skill to pierce the nerve-centre on which their power of locomotion (but none of their other vital functions) depends, so that the paralysed insect, beside which her egg is laid, will furnish the larva, when it is hatched, with a tamed and inoffensive quarry, incapable either of flight or of resistance, but perfectly fresh for the larder: in the same way Françoise had adopted, to minister to her permanent and unfaltering resolution to render the house uninhabitable to any other servant, a series of crafty and pitiless stratagems. Many years later we discovered that, if we had been fed on asparagus day after day throughout that whole season, it was because the smell of the plants gave the poor kitchen-maid, who had to prepare them, such violent attacks of asthma that she was finally obliged to leave my aunt's service."
"Et tandis qu’il écrivait à un de ses amis pour lui demander de chercher à éclaircir tel ou tel point, il éprouvait le repos de cesser de se poser ces questions sans réponses et de transférer à un autre la fatigue d’interroger. Il est vrai que Swann n’était guère plus avancé quand il avait certains renseignements. Savoir ne permet pas toujours d’empêcher, mais du moins les choses que nous savons, nous les tenons, sinon entre nos mains, du moins dans notre pensée où nous les disposons à notre gré, ce qui nous donne l’illusion d’une sorte de pouvoir sur elles. Il était heureux toutes les fois où M. de Charlus était avec Odette. Entre M. de Charlus et elle, Swann savait qu’il ne pouvait rien se passer, que quand M. de Charlus sortait avec elle, c’était par amitié pour lui et qu’il ne ferait pas difficulté à lui raconter ce qu’elle avait fait. Quelquefois elle avait déclaré si catégoriquement à Swann qu’il lui était impossible de le voir un certain soir, elle avait l’air de tenir tant à une sortie, que Swann attachait une véritable importance à ce que M. de Charlus fût libre de l’accompagner. Le lendemain, sans oser poser beaucoup de questions à M. de Charlus, il le contraignait, en ayant l’air de ne pas bien comprendre ses premières réponses, à lui en donner de nouvelles, après chacune desquelles il se sentait plus soulagé, car il apprenait bien vite qu’Odette avait occupé sa soirée aux plaisirs les plus innocents.","And while he wrote to one of his friends to ask him to try to clarify this or that point, he felt the peace of ceasing to ask himself these unanswered questions and transferring to another the fatigue of questioning. It is true that Swann was hardly more advanced when he had certain information. Knowing does not always make it possible to prevent, but at least the things we know, we hold them, if not in our hands, at least in our thoughts where we arrange them as we please, which gives us the illusion of a kind of power over them. He was happy whenever M. de Charlus was with Odette. Between M. de Charlus and her, Swann knew that nothing could happen, that when M. de Charlus went out with her, it was out of friendship for him and that he would have no difficulty in telling her what happened. she had done.

I don’t quite understand . . . You didn’t go straight from her house to the Musée Grévin?","And while he was writing to one of his friends, asking him to try to get a little light thrown upon some point or other, he would feel a sense of relief on ceasing to vex himself with questions to which there was no answer and transferring to some one else the strain of interrogation. It is true that Swann was little the wiser for such information as he did receive. To know a thing does not enable us, always, to prevent its happening, but after all the things that we know we do hold, if not in our hands, at any rate in our minds, where we can dispose of them as we choose, which gives us the illusion of a sort of power to control them.

"En réalité, elle ne se résignait jamais à rien acheter dont on ne pût tirer un profit intellectuel, et surtout celui que nous procurent les belles choses en nous apprenant à chercher notre plaisir ailleurs que dans les satisfactions du bien-être et de la vanité. Même quand elle avait à faire à quelqu’un un cadeau dit utile, quand elle avait à donner un fauteuil, des couverts, une canne, elle les cherchait « anciens », comme si leur longue désuétude ayant effacé leur caractère d’utilité, ils paraissaient plutôt disposés pour nous raconter la vie des hommes d’autrefois que pour servir aux besoins de la nôtre. Elle eût aimé que j’eusse dans ma chambre des photographies des monuments ou des paysages les plus beaux. Mais au moment d’en faire l’emplette, et bien que la chose représentée eût une valeur esthétique, elle trouvait que la vulgarité, l’utilité reprenaient trop vite leur place dans le mode mécanique de représentation, la photographie.","In reality, she never resigned herself to buying anything from which we could not derive an intellectual profit, and above all that which beautiful things afford us by teaching us to seek our pleasure elsewhere than in the satisfactions of well-being and vanity. Even when she had to give someone a so-called useful gift, when she had to give an armchair, cutlery, a cane, she looked for them as ""old"", as if their long disuse having erased their usefulness, they seemed more inclined to tell us about the lives of men of the past than to serve the needs of our own. She would have liked me to have photographs of the most beautiful monuments or landscapes in my room. But when it came time to buy it, and although the thing represented had an aesthetic value, she found that vulgarity and utility were too quickly returning to their place in the mechanical mode of representation, photography.","In fact, she could never resign herself to buying anything from which one could not derive an intellectual profit, and especially that which beautiful things afford us by teaching us to seek our pleasure elsewhere than in the satisfactions of material comfort and vanity.

She would have liked me to have in my room photographs of the most beautiful monuments or landscapes.

She would have liked me to have in my room photographs of ancient buildings or of beautiful places. But at the moment of buying them, and for all that the subject of the picture had an aesthetic value of its own, she would find that vulgarity and utility had too prominent a part in them, through the mechanical nature of their reproduction by photography."
"Elle s’attendait si peu à le voir qu’elle eut un mouvement d’effroi. Quant à lui, il avait couru Paris non parce qu’il croyait possible de la rejoindre, mais parce qu’il lui était trop cruel d’y renoncer. Mais cette joie que sa raison n’avait cessé d’estimer, pour ce soir, irréalisable, ne lui en paraissait maintenant que plus réelle ; car, il n’y avait pas collaboré par la prévision des vraisemblances, elle lui restait extérieure ; il n’avait pas besoin de tirer de son esprit pour la lui fournir – c’est d’elle-même qu’émanait, c’est elle-même qui projetait vers lui – cette vérité qui rayonnait au point de dissiper comme un songe l’isolement qu’il avait redouté, et sur laquelle il appuyait, il reposait, sans penser, sa rêverie heureuse. Ainsi un voyageur arrivé par un beau temps au bord de la Méditerranée, incertain de l’existence des pays qu’il vient de quitter, laisse éblouir sa vue, plutôt qu’il ne leur jette des regards, par les rayons qu’émet vers lui l’azur lumineux et résistant des eaux.","She was so little expecting to see him that she felt terrified. As for him, he had run to Paris not because he thought it possible to join her, but because it was too cruel for him to give it up. But this joy, which his reason had never ceased to consider impossible for this evening, seemed to him now all the more real; for he had not collaborated in it by the forecast of probabilities, it remained external to him; he did not need to draw from his mind to provide it to him – it was from itself that emanated, it was itself that projected towards him – this truth which radiated to the point of dissipating like a dream. the isolation he had dreaded, and on which he relied, he rested, without thinking, his happy reverie. Thus a traveler arriving in fine weather on the shores of the Mediterranean, uncertain of the existence of the countries he has just left, allows his sight to be dazzled, rather than glancing at them, by the rays emitted towards him the luminous and resistant azure of the waters.","She had so little expected to see him that she recoiled in fear. And he himself had run all over Paris not because he thought it was possible to find her, but because it was too hard for him to give up the search. But the joy which his reason had continued to believe was beyond realization that night only seemed even more real now; for since he had not collaborated with it by foreseeing its probabilities, it remained external to him; he did not need to reach into his mind to furnish it with truth, the truth emanated from it, was projected by it toward him, that truth whose radiance dispelled like a dream the isolation he had so dreaded, that truth on which he now based, on which he now rested, without thinking, his happy reverie. In the same way, a traveler arriving at the Mediterranean shore on a day of fine weather, no longer certain that the lands he has just left behind really exist, allows his vision to be dazzled, rather than looking at them himself, by the rays of light emitted in his direction by the luminous, resistant azure of the waters.","She had so little expected to see him that she started back in alarm. As for him, he had ransacked the streets of Paris, not that he supposed it possible that he should find her, but because he would have suffered even more cruelly by abandoning the attempt. But now the joy (which, his reason had never ceased to assure him, was not, that evening at least, to be realised) was suddenly apparent, and more real than ever before; for he himself had contributed nothing to it by anticipating probabilities,—it remained integral and external to himself; there was no need for him to draw on his own resources to endow it with truth—'twas from itself that there emanated, 'twas itself that projected towards him that truth whose glorious rays melted and scattered like the cloud of a dream the sense of loneliness which had lowered over him, that truth upon which he had supported, nay founded, albeit unconsciously, his vision of bliss. So will a traveller, who has come down, on a day of glorious weather, to the Mediterranean shore, and is doubtful whether they still exist, those lands which he has left, let his eyes be dazzled, rather than cast a backward glance, by the radiance streaming towards him from the luminous and unfading azure at his feet."

"D’après ses livres j’imaginais Bergotte comme un vieillard faible et déçu qui avait perdu des enfants et ne s’était jamais consolé. Aussi je lisais, je chantais intérieurement sa prose, plus « dolce », plus « lento » peut-être qu’elle n’était écrite, et la phrase la plus simple s’adressait à moi avec une intonation attendrie. Plus que tout j’aimais sa philosophie, je m’étais donné à elle pour toujours. Elle me rendait impatient d’arriver à l’âge où j’entrerais au collège, dans la classe appelée Philosophie. Mais je ne voulais pas qu’on y fît autre chose que vivre uniquement par la pensée de Bergotte, et si l’on m’avait dit que les métaphysiciens auxquels je m’attacherais alors ne lui ressembleraient en rien, j’aurais ressenti le désespoir d’un amoureux qui veut aimer pour la vie et à qui on parle des autres maîtresses qu’il aura plus tard.","According to his books I imagined Bergotte as a weak and disappointed old man who had lost children and never consoled himself. So I read, I sang inwardly his prose, more ""dolce"", more ""lento"" perhaps than it was written, and the simplest sentence was addressed to me with a tender intonation. More than anything I loved her philosophy, I had given myself to her forever. She made me impatient to reach the age when I would enter college, in the class called Philosophy. But I didn't want people to do anything there other than live solely by the thought of Bergotte, and if someone had told me that the metaphysicians to whom I would then attach myself would in no way resemble him, I would have felt the despair of a lover who wants to love for life and who is told about the other mistresses he will have later.","From his books, I imagined Bergotte to be a frail, disappointed old man who had lost several of his children and never recovered. And so I would read, I would sing his prose to myself, more dolce, more lento24 perhaps than it was written, and the simplest sentence spoke to me with a more tender intonation. Above all else I loved his philosophy, I had pledged myself to it for life. It made me impatient to reach the age when I would enter secondary school and enroll in the class called Philosophy. But I did not want to do anything else there but live according to Bergotte’s ideas exclusively, and, had I been told that the metaphysicians to whom I would be devoting myself by then would not resemble him at all, I would have felt the despair of a lover who wants his love to be lifelong and to whom one talks about the other mistresses he will have later.","From his books I had formed an impression of Bergotte as a frail and disappointed old man, who had lost his children, and had never found any consolation. And so I would read, or rather sing his sentences in my brain, with rather more dolce, rather more lento than he himself had, perhaps, intended, and his simplest phrase would strike my ears with something peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation. More than anything else in the world I cherished his philosophy, and had pledged myself to it in lifelong devotion. It made me impatient to reach the age when I should be eligible to attend the class at school called 'Philosophy.' I did not wish to learn or do anything else there, but simply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of Bergotte, and, if I had been told then that the metaphysicians whom I was actually to follow there resembled him in nothing, I should have been struck down by the despair a young lover feels who has sworn lifelong fidelity, when a friend speaks to him of the other mistresses he will have in time to come."

"« Voyons, monsieur Swann, lui dit-elle, parlez-moi un peu de votre fille ; je suis sûre qu’elle a déjà le goût des belles œuvres comme son papa. » – « Mais venez donc vous asseoir avec nous tous sous la véranda », dit mon grand-père en s’approchant. Ma mère fut obligée de s’interrompre, mais elle tira de cette contrainte même une pensée délicate de plus, comme les bons poètes que la tyrannie de la rime force à trouver leurs plus grandes beautés : « Nous reparlerons d’elle quand nous serons tous les deux, dit-elle à mi-voix à Swann. Il n’y a qu’une maman qui soit digne de vous comprendre. Je suis sûre que la sienne serait de mon avis. » Nous nous assîmes tous autour de la table de fer. J’aurais voulu ne pas penser aux heures d’angoisse que je passerais ce soir seul dans ma chambre sans pouvoir m’endormir ; je tâchais de me persuader qu’elles n’avaient aucune importance, puisque je les aurais oubliées demain matin, de m’attacher à des idées d’avenir qui auraient dû me conduire comme sur un pont au delà de l’abîme prochain qui m’effrayait. Mais mon esprit tendu par ma préoccupation, rendu convexe comme le regard que je dardais sur ma mère, ne se laissait pénétrer par aucune impression étrangère. Les pensées entraient bien en lui, mais à condition de laisser dehors tout élément de beauté ou simplement de drôlerie qui m’eût touché ou distrait. Comme un malade grâce à un anesthésique assiste avec une pleine lucidité à l’opération qu’on pratique sur lui, mais sans rien sentir, je pouvais me réciter des vers que j’aimais ou observer les efforts que mon grand-père faisait pour parler à Swann du duc d’Audiffret-Pasquier, sans que les premiers me fissent éprouver aucune émotion, les seconds aucune gaîté. Ces efforts furent infructueux. À peine mon grand-père eut-il posé à Swann une question relative à cet orateur qu’une des sœurs de ma grand’mère aux oreilles de qui cette question résonna comme un silence profond mais intempestif et qu’il était poli de rompre, interpella l’autre : « Imagine-toi, Céline, que j’ai fait la connaissance d’une jeune institutrice suédoise qui m’a donné sur les coopératives dans les pays scandinaves des détails tout ce qu’il y a de plus intéressants. Il faudra qu’elle vienne dîner ici un soir. » – « Je crois bien ! répondit sa sœur Flora, mais je n’ai pas perdu mon temps non plus. J’ai rencontré chez M. Vinteuil un vieux savant qui connaît beaucoup Maubant, et à qui Maubant a expliqué dans le plus grand détail comment il s’y prend pour composer un rôle. C’est tout ce qu’il y a de plus intéressant. C’est un voisin de M. Vinteuil, je n’en savais rien ; et il est très aimable. » – « Il n’y a pas que M. Vinteuil qui ait des voisins aimables », s’écria ma tante Céline d’une voix que la timidité rendait forte et la préméditation, factice, tout en jetant sur Swann ce qu’elle appelait un regard significatif. En même temps ma tante Flora qui avait compris que cette phrase était le remerciement de Céline pour le vin d’Asti, regardait également Swann avec un air mêlé de congratulation et d’ironie, soit simplement pour souligner le trait d’esprit de sa sœur, soit qu’elle enviât Swann de l’avoir inspiré, soit qu’elle ne pût s’empêcher de se moquer de lui parce qu’elle le croyait sur la sellette. « Je crois qu’on pourra réussir à avoir ce monsieur à dîner, continua Flora ; quand on le met sur Maubant ou sur Mme Materna, il parle des heures sans s’arrêter. » – « Ce doit être délicieux », soupira mon grand-père dans l’esprit de qui la nature avait malheureusement aussi complètement omis d’inclure la possibilité de s’intéresser passionnément aux coopératives suédoises ou à la composition des rôles de Maubant, qu’elle avait oublié de fournir celui des sœurs de ma grand’mère du petit grain de sel qu’il faut ajouter soi-même, pour y trouver quelque saveur, à un récit sur la vie intime de Molé ou du comte de Paris. « Tenez, dit Swann à mon grand-père, ce que je vais vous dire a plus de rapports que cela n’en a l’air avec ce que vous me demandiez, car sur certains points les choses n’ont pas énormément changé. Je relisais ce matin dans Saint-Simon quelque chose qui vous aurait amusé. C’est dans le volume sur son ambassade d’Espagne ; ce n’est pas un des meilleurs, ce n’est guère qu’un journal merveilleusement écrit, ce qui fait déjà une première différence avec les assommants journaux que nous nous croyons obligés de lire matin et soir. » – « Je ne suis pas de votre avis, il y a des jours où la lecture des journaux me semble fort agréable… », interrompit ma tante Flora, pour montrer qu’elle avait lu la phrase sur le Corot de Swann dans le Figaro. « Quand ils parlent de choses ou de gens qui nous intéressent ! » enchérit ma tante Céline. « Je ne dis pas non, répondit Swann étonné. Ce que je reproche aux journaux, c’est de nous faire faire attention tous les jours à des choses insignifiantes tandis que nous lisons trois ou quatre fois dans notre vie les livres où il y a des choses essentielles. Du moment que nous déchirons fiévreusement chaque matin la bande du journal, alors on devrait changer les choses et mettre dans le journal, moi je ne sais pas, les… Pensées de Pascal ! (il détacha ce mot d’un ton d’emphase ironique pour ne pas avoir l’air pédant). Et c’est dans le volume doré sur tranches que nous n’ouvrons qu’une fois tous les dix ans, ajouta-t-il en témoignant pour les choses mondaines ce dédain qu’affectent certains hommes du monde, que nous lirions que la reine de Grèce est allée à Cannes ou que la princesse de Léon a donné un bal costumé. Comme cela la juste proportion serait rétablie. » Mais regrettant de s’être laissé aller à parler même légèrement de choses sérieuses : « Nous avons une bien belle conversation, dit-il ironiquement, je ne sais pas pourquoi nous abordons ces « sommets », et se tournant vers mon grand-père : « Donc Saint-Simon raconte que Maulevrier avait eu l’audace de tendre la main à ses fils. Vous savez, c’est ce Maulevrier dont il dit : « Jamais je ne vis dans cette épaisse bouteille que de l’humeur, de la grossièreté et des sottises. » – « Épaisses ou non, je connais des bouteilles où il y a tout autre chose », dit vivement Flora, qui tenait à avoir remercié Swann elle aussi, car le présent de vin d’Asti s’adressait aux deux. Céline se mit à rire. Swann interloqué reprit : « Je ne sais si ce fut ignorance ou panneau, écrit Saint-Simon, il voulut donner la main à mes enfants. Je m’en aperçus assez tôt pour l’en empêcher. » Mon grand-père s’extasiait déjà sur « ignorance ou panneau », mais Mlle Céline, chez qui le nom de Saint-Simon – un littérateur – avait empêché l’anesthésie complète des facultés auditives, s’indignait déjà : « Comment ? vous admirez cela ? Eh bien ! c’est du joli ! Mais qu’est-ce que cela peut vouloir dire ; est-ce qu’un homme n’est pas autant qu’un autre ? Qu’est-ce que cela peut faire qu’il soit duc ou cocher s’il a de l’intelligence et du cœur ?","“Come, Monsieur Swann,” she said to him, “tell me a little about your daughter; I'm sure she already has a taste for beautiful works like her dad. – “Come and sit with us all on the veranda,” said my grandfather, approaching. My mother was obliged to interrupt herself, but she drew from this very constraint one more delicate thought, like the good poets whom the tyranny of rhyme forces to find their greatest beauties: ""We will speak of her again when we are all both, she whispered to Swann. There is only one mother who is worthy of understanding you. I'm sure hers would agree. We all sat around the iron table. I would have liked not to think of the hours of anguish that I would spend this evening alone in my room without being able to fall asleep; I tried to persuade myself that they were of no importance, since I would have forgotten them tomorrow morning, to attach myself to ideas for the future which should have led me as if on a bridge beyond the approaching abyss which awaits me. 'scared. But my mind strained by my preoccupation, made convex like the gaze I fixed on my mother, did not allow itself to be penetrated by any foreign impression. Thoughts did enter him, but only on condition of leaving out any element of beauty or simply of humor that might have touched or distracted me. Like a patient, thanks to an anesthetic, assists with complete lucidity to the operation being performed on him, but without feeling anything, I could recite to myself verses that I liked or observe the efforts my grandfather made to speak. to Swann from the Duc d'Audiffret-Pasquier, without the former making me feel any emotion, the latter no gaiety. These efforts were unsuccessful. Hardly had my grandfather asked Swann a question relating to this orator when one of my grandmother's sisters, in whose ears this question sounded like a deep but untimely silence which it was polite to break, called out the other: “Imagine, Céline, that I met a young Swedish teacher who gave me all the most interesting details about cooperatives in the Scandinavian countries. She must come here for dinner one evening. "" - "" I think so ! answered his sister Flora, but I haven't wasted my time either. I met at M. Vinteuil's an old scholar who knows Maubant very well, and to whom Maubant explained in the greatest detail how he goes about composing a role. That's all the more interesting. He is a neighbor of M. Vinteuil, I did not know; and he is very kind. – ""It's not just M. Vinteuil who has kind neighbors,"" cried my aunt Céline in a voice made strong by shyness and artificial premeditation, while throwing at Swann what she called for a meaningful look. At the same time, my aunt Flora, who had understood that this sentence was Céline's thanks for the Asti wine, was also looking at Swann with a mixed air of congratulation and irony, either simply to underline her sister's witticism. , either she envied Swann for having inspired her, or she couldn't help laughing at him because she thought he was in the hot seat. “I think we can manage to have this gentleman to dinner,” continued Flora; when you put him on Maubant or Madame Materna, he talks for hours without stopping. – “It must be delicious,” sighed my grandfather in whose mind nature had unfortunately also completely omitted to include the possibility of taking a passionate interest in Swedish cooperatives or the composition of Maubant roles, that She had forgotten to supply that of my grandmother's sisters with the little grain of salt that you have to add yourself, to find some flavor in it, to a story about the private life of Molé or the Comte de Paris. ""Look,"" said Swann to my grandfather, ""what I'm going to tell you has more to do with what you were asking me than it seems, because on certain points things haven't changed very much. I was re-reading something in Saint-Simon this morning that would have amused you. It is in the volume on his Spanish embassy; it is not one of the best, it is hardly more than a marvelously written newspaper, which already makes a first difference with the boring newspapers which we believe ourselves obliged to read morning and evening. – ""I don't agree with you, there are days when reading the newspapers seems very pleasant to me..."", interrupted my aunt Flora, to show that she had read the sentence on Swann's Corot in the Figaro. . “When they talk about things or people that interest us! added my aunt Céline. ""I'm not saying no,"" answered Swann surprised. What I blame newspapers for is making us pay attention every day to insignificant things while we read three or four times in our lives books where there are essential things. As long as we feverishly tear the strip from the diary every morning, then we should change things and put in the diary, I don't know, the… Thoughts of Pascal! (he detached this word in a tone of ironic emphasis so as not to sound pedantic). And it is in the gilt-edged volume that we only open once every ten years, he added, showing that contempt for worldly things which certain men of the world affect, that we would read that the Queen of Greece went to Cannes or the Princess of Léon gave a costume ball. In this way the right proportion would be restored. "" But regretting having allowed himself to talk even slightly about serious things: "" We have a very nice conversation, he says ironically, I do not know why we approach these ""summits"", and turning to my grandfather “So Saint-Simon says that Maulevrier had had the audacity to reach out to his sons. You know, it's this Maulevrier of whom he says: ""I never saw in this thick bottle anything but humor, rudeness and foolishness. – “Thick or not, I know bottles in which there is something quite different,” said Flora eagerly, who was anxious to have thanked Swann too, for the present of Asti wine was addressed to both. Celine laughed. Swann taken aback continued: ""I don't know if it was ignorance or a sign,"" writes Saint-Simon, ""he wanted to give my children a hand."" I noticed it early enough to stop him. My grandfather was already in ecstasies over ""ignorance or a sign"", but Mademoiselle Céline, for whom the name of Saint-Simon – a writer – had prevented the complete anesthesia of the auditory faculties, was already indignant: “How? do you admire that? Well ! it's pretty! But what can that mean; is not one man as much as another? What does it matter if he is duke or coachman if he has intelligence and heart?","“Now, M. Swann,” she said to him, “do tell me about your daughter; I’m sure she already has a taste for beautiful things like her papa.” “Here, come and sit with the rest of us on the veranda,” said my grandfather, coming up to them. My mother was obliged to stop, but she derived from this very constraint one more delicate thought, like good poets forced by the tyranny of rhyme to find their most beautiful lines: “We can talk about her again when we’re by ourselves,” she said softly to Swann. “Only a mother is capable of understanding you. I’m sure her own mother would agree with me.” We all sat down around the iron table. I would have preferred not to think about the hours of anguish I was going to endure that evening alone in my room without being able to go to sleep; I tried to persuade myself they were not at all important, since I would have forgotten them by tomorrow morning, and to fix my mind on ideas of the future that should have led me as though across a bridge beyond the imminent abyss that frightened me so. But my mind, strained by my preoccupation, convex like the glance which I shot at my mother, would not allow itself to be penetrated by any foreign impressions. Thoughts certainly entered it, but only on condition that they left outside every element of beauty or simply of playfulness that could have moved or distracted me. Just as a patient, by means of an anesthetic, can watch with complete lucidity the operation being performed on him, but without feeling anything, I could recite to myself some lines that I loved or observe the efforts my grandfather made to talk to Swann about the Duc d’Audiffret-Pasquier, without the former making me feel any emotion, the latter any hilarity. Those efforts were fruitless. Scarcely had my grandfather asked Swann a question relating to that orator than one of my grandmother’s sisters, in whose ears the question was resonating like a profound but untimely silence that should be broken for the sake of politeness, would address the other: “Just imagine, Céline, I’ve met a young Swedish governess who has been telling me about cooperatives in the Scandinavian countries; the details are most interesting. We really must have her here for dinner one evening.” “Certainly!” answered her sister Flora,17 “but I haven’t been wasting my time either. At M. Vinteuil’s I met a learned old man who knows Maubant18 very well, and Maubant has explained to him in the greatest detail how he creates his parts. It’s most interesting. He’s a neighbor of M. Vinteuil ’s , I had no idea; and he’s very nice.” “M. Vinteuil isn’t the only one who has nice neighbors,” exclaimed my aunt Céline in a voice amplified by her shyness and given an artificial tone by her premeditation, while casting at Swann what she called a meaningful look. At the same time my aunt Flora, who had understood that this phrase was Céline’s way of thanking Swann for the Asti, was also looking at Swann with an expression that combined congratulation and irony, either simply to emphasize her sister’s witticism, or because she envied Swann for having inspired it, or because she could not help making fun of him since she thought he was being put on the spot. “I think we can manage to persuade the old gentleman to come for dinner,” continued Flora; “when you get him started on Maubant or Mme. Materna,19 he talks for hours without stopping.” “That must be delightful,” sighed my grandfather, in whose mind, unfortunately, nature had as completely failed to include the possibility of taking a passionate interest in Swedish cooperatives or the creation of Maubant’s parts as it had forgotten to furnish those of my grandmother’s sisters with the little grain of salt one must add oneself, in order to find some savor in it, to a story about the private life of Molé or the Comte de Paris. “Now, then,” said Swann to my grandfather, “what I’m going to say has more to do than it might appear with what you were asking me, because in certain respects things haven’t changed enormously. This morning I was rereading something in Saint-Simon20 that would have amused you. It’s in the volume about his mission to Spain;21 it’s not one of the best, hardly more than a journal, but at least it’s a marvelously well written one, which already makes it rather fundamentally different from the deadly boring journals we think we have to read every morning and evening.” “I don’t agree, there are days when reading the papers seems to me very pleasant indeed . . .” my aunt Flora interrupted, to show that she had read the sentence about Swann’s Corot in Le Figaro. “When they talk about things or people that interest us!” said my aunt Céline, going one better. “I don’t deny it,” answered Swann with surprise. “What I fault the newspapers for is that day after day they draw our attention to insignificant things whereas only three or four times in our lives do we read a book in which there is something really essential. Since we tear the band off the newspaper so feverishly every morning, they ought to change things and put into the newspaper, oh, I don’t know, perhaps . . . Pascal’s Pensées!” (He isolated this word with an ironic emphasis so as not to seem pedantic.) “And then, in the gilt-edged volume that we open only once in ten years,” he added, showing the disdain for worldly matters affected by certain worldly men, “we would read that the Queen of Greece has gone to Cannes or that the Princesse de Léon has given a costume ball. This way, the proper proportions would be reestablished.” But, feeling sorry he had gone so far as to speak even lightly of serious things: “What a lofty conversation we’re having,” he said ironically; “I don’t know why we’re climbing to such ‘heights’”—and turning to my grandfather: “Well, Saint-Simon describes how Maulévrier22 had the audacity to offer to shake hands with Saint-Simon’s sons. You know, this is the same Maulévrier of whom he says: ‘Never did I see in that thick bottle anything but ill-humor, vulgarity, and foolishness.’” “Thick or not, I know some bottles in which there is something quite different,” said Flora vivaciously, determined that she too should thank Swann, because the gift of Asti was addressed to both of them. Céline laughed. Swann, disconcerted, went on: “‘I cannot say whether it was ignorance or a trap,’ wrote Saint-Simon. ‘ He tried to shake hands with my children. I noticed it in time to prevent him.’ ” My grandfather was already in ecstasies over “ignorance or a trap,” but Mlle. Céline, in whom the name of Saint-Simon—a literary man—had prevented the complete anesthesia of her auditory faculties, was already growing indignant: “What? You admire that? Well, that’s a fine thing! But what can it mean; isn’t one man as good as the next? What difference does it make whether he’s a duke or a coachman, if he’s intelligent and good-hearted?","""Now, M. Swann,"" she said, ""do tell me about your daughter; I am sure she shews a taste already for nice things, like her papa."" ""Come along and sit down here with us all on the verandah,"" said my grandfather, coming up to him. My mother had to abandon the quest, but managed to extract from the restriction itself a further refinement of thought, as great poets do when the tyranny of rhyme forces them into the discovery of their finest lines. ""We can talk about her again when we are by ourselves,"" she said, or rather whispered to Swann. ""It is only a mother who can understand. I am sure that hers would agree with me."" And so we all sat down round the iron table. I should have liked not to think of the hours of anguish which I should have to spend, that evening, alone in my room, without the possibility of going to sleep: I tried to convince myself that they were of no importance, really, since I should have forgotten them next morning, and to fix my mind on thoughts of the future which would carry me, as on a bridge, across the terrifying abyss that yawned at my feet. But my mind, strained by this foreboding, distended like the look which I shot at my mother, would not allow any other impression to enter. Thoughts did, indeed, enter it, but only on the condition that they left behind them every element of beauty, or even of quaintness, by which I might have been distracted or beguiled. As a surgical patient, by means of a local anaesthetic, can look on with a clear consciousness while an operation is being performed upon him and yet feel nothing, I could repeat to myself some favourite lines, or watch my grandfather attempting to talk to Swann about the Duc d'Audriffet-Pasquier, without being able to kindle any emotion from one or amusement from the other. Hardly had my grandfather begun to question Swann about that orator when one of my grandmother's sisters, in whose ears the question echoed like a solemn but untimely silence which her natural politeness bade her interrupt, addressed the other with: ""Just fancy, Flora, I met a young Swedish governess to-day who told me some most interesting things about the co-operative movement in Scandinavia. We really must have her to dine here one evening."" ""To be sure!"" said her sister Flora, ""but I haven't wasted my time either. I met such a clever old gentleman at M. Vinteuil's who knows Maubant quite well, and Maubant has told him every little thing about how he gets up his parts. It is the most interesting thing I ever heard. He is a neighbour of M. Vinteuil's, and I never knew; and he is so nice besides."" ""M. Vinteuil is not the only one who has nice neighbours,"" cried my aunt Céline in a voice which seemed loud because she was so timid, and seemed forced because she had been planning the little speech for so long; darting, as she spoke, what she called a 'significant glance' at Swann. And my aunt Flora, who realised that this veiled utterance was Céline's way of thanking Swann intelligibly for the Asti, looked at him with a blend of congratulation and irony, either just, because she wished to underline her sister's little epigram, or because she envied Swann his having inspired it, or merely because she imagined that he was embarrassed, and could not help having a little fun at his expense. ""I think it would be worth while,"" Flora went on, ""to have this old gentleman to dinner. When you get him upon Maubant or Mme. Materna he will talk for hours on end."" ""That must be delightful,"" sighed my grandfather, in whose mind nature had unfortunately forgotten to include any capacity whatsoever for becoming passionately interested in the co-operative movement among the ladies of Sweden or in the methods employed by Maubant to get up his parts, just as it had forgotten to endow my grandmother's two sisters with a grain of that precious salt which one has oneself to 'add to taste' in order to extract any savour from a narrative of the private life of Mole or of the Comte de Paris. ""I say!"" exclaimed Swann to my grandfather, ""what I was going to tell you has more to do than you might think with what you were asking me just now, for in some respects there has been very little change. I came across a passage in Saint-Simon this morning which would have amused you. It is in the volume which covers his mission to Spain; not one of the best, little more in fact than a journal, but at least it is a journal wonderfully well written, which fairly distinguishes it from the devastating journalism that we feel bound to read in these days, morning, noon and night."" ""I do not agree with you: there are some days when I find reading the papers very pleasant indeed!"" my aunt Flora broke in, to show Swann that she had read the note about his Corot in the Figaro. ""Yes,"" aunt Céline went one better. ""When they write about things or people in whom we are interested."" ""I don't deny it,"" answered Swann in some bewilderment. "" The fault I find with our journalism is that it forces us to take an interest in some fresh triviality or other every day, whereas only three or four books in a lifetime give us anything that is of real importance. Suppose that, every morning, when we tore the wrapper off our paper with fevered hands, a transmutation were to take place, and we were to find inside it— oh! I don't know; shall we say Pascal's Pensées?"" He articulated the title with an ironic emphasis so as not to appear pedantic. "" And then, in the gilt and tooled volumes which we open once in ten years,"" he went on, shewing that contempt for the things of this world which some men of the world like to affect, ""we should read that the Queen of the Hellenes had arrived at Cannes, or that the Princesse de Léon had given a fancy dress ball. In that way we should arrive at the right proportion between 'information' and 'publicity.'"" But at once regretting that he had allowed himself to speak, even in jest, of serious matters, he added ironically: ""We are having a most entertaining conversation; I cannot think why we climb to these lofty summits,"" and then, turning to my grandfather: ""Well, Saint-Simon tells how Maulevrier had had the audacity to offer his hand to his sons. You remember how he says of Maulevrier, 'Never did I find in that coarse bottle anything but ill-humour, boorishness, and folly.'"" ""Coarse or not, I know bottles in which there is something very different!"" said Flora briskly, feeling bound to thank Swann as well as her sister, since the present of Asti had been addressed to them both. Céline began to laugh. Swann was puzzled, but went on: ""'I cannot say whether it was his ignorance or a trap,' writes Saint-Simon; 'he wished to give his hand to my children. I noticed it in time to prevent him.'"" My grandfather was already in ecstasies over ""ignorance or a trap,"" but Miss Céline—the name of Saint-Simon, a 'man of letters,' having arrested the complete paralysis of her sense of hearing—had grown angry. ""What! You admire that, do you? Well, it is clever enough! But what is the point of it? Does he mean that one man isn't as good as another? What difference can it make whether he is a duke or a groom so long as he is intelligent and good?"
"Vivant dans une famille provinciale qui avait peu de relations, n’allant guère au bal, elle s’était grisée dans la solitude de son manoir, à ralentir, à précipiter la danse de tous ces couples imaginaires, à les égrener comme des fleurs, à quitter un moment le bal pour entendre le vent souffler dans les sapins, au bord du lac, et à y voir tout d’un coup s’avancer, plus différent de tout ce qu’on a jamais rêvé que ne sont les amants de la terre, un mince jeune homme à la voix un peu chantante, étrangère et fausse, en gants blancs. Mais aujourd’hui la beauté démodée de cette musique semblait défraîchie. Privée depuis quelques années de l’estime des connaisseurs, elle avait perdu son honneur et son charme et ceux mêmes dont le goût est mauvais n’y trouvaient plus qu’un plaisir inavoué et médiocre. Mme de Cambremer jeta un regard furtif derrière elle. Elle savait que sa jeune bru (pleine de respect pour sa nouvelle famille, sauf en ce qui touchait les choses de l’esprit sur lesquelles, sachant jusqu’à l’harmonie et jusqu’au grec, elle avait des lumières spéciales) méprisait Chopin et souffrait quand elle en entendait jouer. Mais loin de la surveillance de cette wagnérienne qui était plus loin avec un groupe de personnes de son âge, Mme de Cambremer se laissait aller à des impressions délicieuses. La princesse des Laumes les éprouvait aussi. Sans être par nature douée pour la musique, elle avait reçu il y a quinze ans les leçons qu’un professeur de piano du faubourg Saint-Germain, femme de génie qui avait été à la fin de sa vie réduite à la misère, avait recommencé, à l’âge de soixante-dix ans, à donner aux filles et aux petites-filles de ses anciennes élèves. Elle était morte aujourd’hui. Mais sa méthode, son beau son, renaissaient parfois sous les doigts de ses élèves, même de celles qui étaient devenues pour le reste des personnes médiocres, avaient abandonné la musique et n’ouvraient presque plus jamais un piano. Aussi Mme des Laumes put-elle secouer la tête, en pleine connaissance de cause, avec une appréciation juste de la façon dont le pianiste jouait ce prélude qu’elle savait par cœur. La fin de la phrase commencée chanta d’elle-même sur ses lèvres. Et elle murmura « c’est toujours charmant », avec un double ch au commencement du mot qui était une marque de délicatesse et dont elle sentait ses lèvres si romanesquement froissées comme une belle fleur, qu’elle harmonisa instinctivement son regard avec elles en lui donnant à ce moment-là une sorte de sentimentalité et de vague. Cependant Mme de Gallardon était en train de se dire qu’il était fâcheux qu’elle n’eût que bien rarement l’occasion de rencontrer la princesse des Laumes, car elle souhaitait lui donner une leçon en ne répondant pas à son salut. Elle ne savait pas que sa cousine fût là. Un mouvement de tête de Mme de Franquetot la lui découvrit. Aussitôt elle se précipita vers elle en dérangeant tout le monde ; mais désireuse de garder un air hautain et glacial qui rappelât à tous qu’elle ne désirait pas avoir de relations avec une personne chez qui on pouvait se trouver nez à nez avec la princesse Mathilde, et au-devant de qui elle n’avait pas à aller car elle n’était pas « sa contemporaine », elle voulut pourtant compenser cet air de hauteur et de réserve par quelque propos qui justifiât sa démarche et forçât la princesse à engager la conversation ; aussi une fois arrivée près de sa cousine, Mme de Gallardon, avec un visage dur, une main tendue comme une carte forcée, lui dit : « Comment va ton mari ? » de la même voix soucieuse que si le prince avait été gravement malade.","Living in a provincial family which had few connections, hardly going to balls, she had intoxicated herself in the solitude of her manor, slowing down, rushing the dance of all these imaginary couples, shattering them like flowers, to leave the ball for a moment to hear the wind blow in the fir trees, on the edge of the lake, and to see all of a sudden coming forward, more different from anything one has ever dreamed than are the lovers of the earth, a slender young man with a slightly singsong, foreign and false voice, in white gloves. But today the old-fashioned beauty of this music seemed faded. Deprived for some years of the esteem of connoisseurs, it had lost its honor and its charm and even those whose taste is bad found in it only an unacknowledged and mediocre pleasure. Madame de Cambremer cast a furtive glance behind her. She knew that her young daughter-in-law (full of respect for her new family, except in matters of the mind on which, knowing even harmony and even Greek, she had special knowledge) despised Chopin. and suffered when she heard it played. But far from the surveillance of this Wagnerian who was further away with a group of people of her own age, Madame de Cambremer indulged in delicious impressions. The Princess of Laumes felt them too. Without being gifted for music by nature, she had received lessons fifteen years ago that a piano teacher from the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a woman of genius who had been reduced to misery at the end of her life, had started again. , at the age of seventy, to give to the daughters and granddaughters of his former pupils. She was dead today. But his method, his beautiful sound, sometimes reappeared under the fingers of his students, even those who for the rest had become mediocre people, had abandoned music and hardly ever opened a piano again. So Madame des Laumes was able to shake her head, knowingly, with a fair appreciation of the way the pianist was playing this prelude which she knew by heart. The end of the sentence begun sang of itself on his lips. And she murmured ""it's always charming"", with a double ch at the beginning of the word which was a mark of delicacy and which she felt her lips crumpled so romantically like a beautiful flower, that she instinctively harmonized her gaze with them in him. giving that moment a kind of sentimentality and vagueness. However, Madame de Gallardon was saying to herself that it was a pity that she rarely had the opportunity to meet the Princess of Laumes, for she wished to teach her a lesson by not responding to her greeting. She didn't know her cousin was there. A nod of Madame de Franquetot revealed it to him. She immediately rushed towards her, disturbing everyone; but desirous of keeping a haughty and icy air which reminded everyone that she did not wish to have relations with a person in whose house one could find herself face to face with Princess Mathilde, and in front of whom she had no to go because she was not ""his contemporary"", she nevertheless wanted to compensate for this air of haughtiness and reserve by some remark which justified her approach and forced the princess to engage in conversation; So once she got to her cousin, Madame de Gallardon, with a hard face, a hand stretched out like a forced card, said to her: ""How is your husband?"" in the same worried voice as if the prince had been gravely ill.","Living in a provincial family that had few friends, scarcely ever going out to a ball, she had intoxicated herself in the solitude of her manor house, with all those imaginary dancing couples, now slowing them, now speeding them, now scattering them like flowers, now leaving the ball for a moment to hear the wind blow in the pine trees, at the edge of the lake, and suddenly seeing, as he came toward her there, more unlike anything anyone had ever dreamed of than an earthly lover could be, a slender young man in white gloves whose voice had a strange, false lilt to it. But nowadays the old-fashioned beauty of that music seemed stale. Having fallen in the esteem of the discriminating public over the past several years, it had lost its position of distinction and its charm, and even those whose taste is bad no longer took more than an unacknowledged and moderate pleasure in it. Mme. de Cambremer cast a furtive glance behind her. She was aware that her young daughter-in-law (full of respect for her new family, except regarding the things of the mind about which, since she knew a little harmony and even some Greek, she was especially enlightened) despised Chopin and suffered when she heard it played. But far away from the surveillance of that Wagnerian who was off in the distance with a group of people her own age, Mme. de Cambremer abandoned herself to her delightful impressions. The Princesse des Laumes was enjoying them too. Though without a natural gift for music, she had had lessons fifteen years earlier from a piano teacher of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a woman of genius who at the end of her life had been reduced to poverty and had returned, at the age of seventy, to giving piano lessons, to the daughters and granddaughters of her old pupils. She was dead now. But her method, her lovely sound, came back to life sometimes under the fingers of her pupils, even those who had become in other respects ordinary people, had abandoned music, and almost never opened a piano anymore. And so Mme. des Laumes could shake her head, with expert knowledge, with a just appreciation of the way the pianist was playing this prelude, which she knew by heart. The end of the phrase he had begun already sang on her lips. And she murmured, “It’s always charming,” with a double ch at the start of the word which was a mark of refinement and which, she felt, pursed her lips so romantically, like a beautiful flower, that she instinctively brought her eyes into harmony with them by giving them an expression just then of sentimentality and vague yearning. Meanwhile, Mme. de Gallardon was saying to herself how annoying it was that she only very rarely had the opportunity to meet the Princesse des Laumes, for she wanted to teach her a lesson by not responding to her greeting. She did not know her cousin was there. A movement of Mme. de Franquetot’s head revealed the Princesse to her. Immediately she hurried toward her, disturbing everyone; but though she wanted to preserve a haughty and glacial manner which would remind everyone that she did not wish to be on friendly terms with a person in whose house one might find oneself coming face-to-face with Princesse Mathilde, and to whom it was not for her to make advances since she was not “of her generation,” still she wanted to offset this air of haughtiness and reserve by some remark that would justify her overture and force the Princesse to engage in conversation; and so when she came near her cousin, Mme. de Gallardon, with a hard expression and a hand outthrust like a “forced” card, said to her: “How is your husband?” in the concerned tone she would have used if the Prince had been gravely ill.","Brought up in a provincial household with few friends or visitors, hardly ever invited to a ball, she had fuddled her mind, in the solitude of her old manor-house, over setting the pace, now crawling-slow, now passionate, whirling, breathless, for all those imaginary waltzing couples, gathering them like flowers, leaving the ball-room for a moment to listen, where the wind sighed among the pine-trees, on the shore of the lake, and seeing of a sudden advancing towards her, more different from anything one had ever dreamed of than earthly lovers are, a slender young man, whose voice was resonant and strange and false, in white gloves. But nowadays the old-fashioned beauty of this music seemed to have become a trifle stale. Having forfeited, some years back, the esteem of 'really musical' people, it had lost its distinction and its charm, and even those whose taste was frankly bad had ceased to find in it more than a moderate pleasure to which they hardly liked to confess. Mme. de Cambremer cast a furtive glance behind her. She knew that her young daughter-in-law (full of respect for her new and noble family, except in such matters as related to the intellect, upon which, having 'got as far' as Harmony and the Greek alphabet, she was specially enlightened) despised Chopin, and fell quite ill when she heard him played. But finding herself free from the scrutiny of this Wagnerian, who was sitting, at some distance, in a group of her own contemporaries, Mme. de Cambremer let herself drift upon a stream of exquisite memories and sensations. The Princesse des Laumes was touched also. Though without any natural gift for music, she had received, some fifteen years earlier, the instruction which a music-mistress of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a woman of genius who had been, towards the end of her life, reduced to penury, had started, at seventy, to give to the daughters and granddaughters of her old pupils. This lady was now dead. But her method, an echo of her charming touch, came to life now and then in the fingers of her pupils, even of those who had been in other respects quite mediocre, had given up music, and hardly ever opened a piano. And so Mme. des Laumes could let her head sway to and fro, fully aware of the cause, with a perfect appreciation of the manner in which the pianist was rendering this Prelude, since she knew it by heart. The closing notes of the phrase that he had begun sounded already on her lips. And she murmured ""How charming it is!"" with a stress on the opening consonants of the adjective, a token of her refinement by which she felt her lips so romantically compressed, like the petals of a beautiful, budding flower, that she instinctively brought her eyes into harmony, illuminating them for a moment with a vague and sentimental gaze. Meanwhile Mme. de Gallardon had arrived at the point of saying to herself how annoying it was that she had so few opportunities of meeting the Princesse des Laumes, for she meant to teach her a lesson by not acknowledging her bow. She did not know that her cousin was in the room. A movement of Mme. Franquetot's head disclosed the Princess. At once Mme. de Gallardon dashed towards her, upsetting all her neighbours; although determined to preserve a distant and glacial manner which should remind everyone present that she had no desire to remain on friendly terms with a person in whose house one might find oneself, any day, cheek by jowl with the Princesse Mathilde, and to whom it was not her duty to make advances since she was not 'of her generation,' she felt bound to modify this air of dignity and reserve by some non-committal remark which would justify her overture and would force the Princess to engage in conversation; and so, when she reached her cousin, Mme. de Gallardon, with a stern countenance and one hand thrust out as though she were trying to 'force' a card, began with: ""How is your husband?"" in the same anxious tone that she would have used if the Prince had been seriously ill."

"À Combray, tous les jours dès la fin de l’après-midi, longtemps avant le moment où il faudrait me mettre au lit et rester, sans dormir, loin de ma mère et de ma grand’mère, ma chambre à coucher redevenait le point fixe et douloureux de mes préoccupations. On avait bien inventé, pour me distraire les soirs où on me trouvait l’air trop malheureux, de me donner une lanterne magique, dont, en attendant l’heure du dîner, on coiffait ma lampe ; et, à l’instar des premiers architectes et maîtres verriers de l’âge gothique, elle substituait à l’opacité des murs d’impalpables irisations, de surnaturelles apparitions multicolores, où des légendes étaient dépeintes comme dans un vitrail vacillant et momentané. Mais ma tristesse n’en était qu’accrue, parce que rien que le changement d’éclairage détruisait l’habitude que j’avais de ma chambre et grâce à quoi, sauf le supplice du coucher, elle m’était devenue supportable. Maintenant je ne la reconnaissais plus et j’y étais inquiet, comme dans une chambre d’hôtel ou de « chalet », où je fusse arrivé pour la première fois en descendant de chemin de fer.","At Combray, every day from the end of the afternoon, long before the moment when I should have to go to bed and stay, without sleeping, far from my mother and my grandmother, my bedroom once again became the fixed and painful point of my preoccupations. They had invented, to distract me on evenings when they thought I looked too unhappy, to give me a magic lantern, with which, while waiting for dinner time, they put my lamp on the top; and, like the first architects and master glassmakers of the Gothic age, she substituted for the opacity of the walls impalpable iridescences, supernatural multicolored apparitions, where legends were depicted as in a flickering and momentary stained-glass window. But my sadness was only increased, because the change of light alone destroyed the habit I had of my room and thanks to which, except the torture of going to bed, it had become bearable to me. Now I no longer recognized it and I was uneasy there, as in a hotel room or a ""chalet"" where I had arrived for the first time while getting off the train.","At Combray, every day, in the late afternoon, long before the moment when I would have to go to bed and stay there, without sleeping, far away from my mother and grandmother, my bedroom again became the fixed and painful focus of my preoccupations. They had indeed hit upon the idea, to distract me on the evenings when they found me looking too unhappy, of giving me a magic lantern, which, while awaiting the dinner hour, they would set on top of my lamp; and, after the fashion of the first architects and master glaziers of the Gothic age, it replaced the opacity of the walls with impalpable iridescences, supernatural multicolored apparitions, where legends were depicted as in a wavering, momentary stained-glass window. But my sadness was only increased by this since the mere change in lighting destroyed the familiarity which my bedroom had acquired for me and which, except for the torment of going to bed, had made it tolerable to me. Now I no longer recognized it and I was uneasy there, as in a room in some hotel or “chalet” to which I had come for the first time straight from the railway train.","At Combray, as every afternoon ended, long before the time when I should have to go up to bed, and to lie there, unsleeping, far from my mother and grandmother, my bedroom became the fixed point on which my melancholy and anxious thoughts were centred. Some one had had the happy idea of giving me, to distract me on evenings when I seemed abnormally wretched, a magic lantern, which used to be set on top of my lamp while we waited for dinner-time to come: in the manner of the master-builders and glass-painters of gothic days it substituted for the opaqueness of my walls an impalpable iridescence, supernatural phenomena of many colours, in which legends were depicted, as on a shifting and transitory window. But my sorrows were only increased, because this change of lighting destroyed, as nothing else could have done, the customary impression I had formed of my room, thanks to which the room itself, but for the torture of having to go to bed in it, had become quite endurable. For now I no longer recognised it, and I became uneasy, as though I were in a room in some hotel or furnished lodging, in a place where I had just arrived, by train, for the first time."
"Bien que Swann n’eût encore jamais pris bien sérieusement ombrage de l’amitié d’Odette pour tel ou tel fidèle, il éprouvait une douceur profonde à l’entendre avouer ainsi devant tous, avec cette tranquille impudeur, leurs rendez-vous quotidiens du soir, la situation privilégiée qu’il avait chez elle et la préférence pour lui qui y était impliquée. Certes Swann avait souvent pensé qu’Odette n’était à aucun degré une femme remarquable, et la suprématie qu’il exerçait sur un être qui lui était si inférieur n’avait rien qui dût lui paraître si flatteur à voir proclamer à la face des « fidèles », mais depuis qu’il s’était aperçu qu’à beaucoup d’hommes Odette semblait une femme ravissante et désirable, le charme qu’avait pour eux son corps avait éveillé en lui un besoin douloureux de la maîtriser entièrement dans les moindres parties de son cœur. Et il avait commencé d’attacher un prix inestimable à ces moments passés chez elle le soir, où il l’asseyait sur ses genoux, lui faisait dire ce qu’elle pensait d’une chose, d’une autre, où il recensait les seuls biens à la possession desquels il tînt maintenant sur terre. Aussi, après ce dîner, la prenant à part, il ne manqua pas de la remercier avec effusion, cherchant à lui enseigner selon les degrés de la reconnaissance qu’il lui témoignait, l’échelle des plaisirs qu’elle pouvait lui causer, et dont le suprême était de le garantir, pendant le temps que son amour durerait et l’y rendrait vulnérable, des atteintes de la jalousie.","Although Swann had never yet taken very seriously umbrage at Odette's friendship for such and such a devotee, he felt a profound sweetness in hearing her confess thus in front of everyone, with this calm shamelessness, their daily meetings of the night, the privileged position he had in her home and the preference for him that was involved in it. Certainly Swann had often thought that Odette was in no way a remarkable woman, and the supremacy he exercised over a being who was so inferior to him had nothing that should have seemed to him so flattering to see proclaimed in the face of ""faithful"", but since he had noticed that to many men Odette seemed a ravishing and desirable woman, the charm that her body had for them had awakened in him a painful need to master her completely in the smallest parts of his heart. And he had begun to attach inestimable value to those moments spent at her house in the evening, when he sat her on his knees, made her say what she thought of one thing, another, where he listed the the only possessions to which he now clung on earth. Also, after this dinner, taking her aside, he did not fail to thank her effusively, seeking to teach her, according to the degrees of gratitude he showed her, the scale of the pleasures she could cause him, and the supreme thing of which was to protect him, during the time that his love lasted and made him vulnerable to it, from the attacks of jealousy.","Even though Swann had never become very seriously offended by Odette’s friendliness toward one or another of the faithful, he felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her thus confess in front of everyone, with such a calm lack of modesty, to their regular meetings every night, his privileged position in her house, and the preference for him which it implied. Of course Swann had often reflected that Odette was in no way a remarkable woman, and the ascendancy he exerted over a creature so inferior to him was not something that ought to appear to him so flattering to see proclaimed to all the “faithful,” but from the time he had first noticed that many men found Odette an enchanting and desirable woman, the attraction her body had for them had awoken in him a painful need to master her entirely even in the smallest parts of her heart. And he had begun to set an inestimable price on those times spent in her house at night, when he would sit her on his knees, make her say what she thought of one thing, of another, when he would count up the only goods whose possession he now valued on earth. And so, after this dinner, taking her aside, he did not fail to thank her effusively, endeavoring to teach her according to the degrees of gratitude he displayed to her, the scale of pleasures that she could give him, the highest of which was to guarantee him, during the time that his love should last and make him vulnerable to them, protection from the assaults of jealousy.","And although Swann had never yet taken offence, at all seriously, at Odette's demonstrations of friendship for one or other of the 'faithful,' he felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her thus avow, before them all, with that calm immodesty, the fact that they saw each other regularly every evening, his privileged position in her house, and her own preference for him which it implied. It was true that Swann had often reflected that Odette was in no way a remarkable woman; and in the supremacy which he wielded over a creature so distinctly inferior to himself there was nothing that especially flattered him when he heard it proclaimed to all the 'faithful'; but since he had observed that, to several other men than himself, Odette seemed a fascinating and desirable woman, the attraction which her body held for him had aroused a painful longing to secure the absolute mastery of even the tiniest particles of her heart. And he had begun to attach an incalculable value to those moments passed in her house in the evenings, when he held her upon his knee, made her tell him what she thought about this or that, and counted over that treasure to which, alone of all his earthly possessions, he still clung. And so, after this dinner, drawing her aside, he took care to thank her effusively, seeking to indicate to her by the extent of his gratitude the corresponding intensity of the pleasures which it was in her power to bestow on him, the supreme pleasure being to guarantee him immunity, for as long as his love should last and he remain vulnerable, from the assaults of jealousy."
"Aussitôt Cottard, s’en rapportant aux paroles de Swann, adopta cette opinion, au sujet de la valeur d’une invitation chez M. Grévy, que c’était chose fort peu recherchée et qui courait les rues. Dès lors, il ne s’étonna plus que Swann, aussi bien qu’un autre, fréquentât l’Élysée, et même il le plaignait un peu d’aller à des déjeuners que l’invité avouait lui-même être ennuyeux.","Cottard immediately, relying on Swann's words, adopted this opinion, on the subject of the value of an invitation to M. Grévy, that it was something very little sought after and which ran the streets. From then on, he was no longer surprised that Swann, like anyone else, frequented the Elysée, and he even pitied him a little for going to lunches which the guest himself admitted to be boring.","Immediately Cottard, trusting in the truth of what Swann had said, adopted the opinion, concerning the value of an invitation to M. Grévy’s, that it was not a very desirable thing and could be picked up anywhere. From then on, he was no longer surprised that Swann, or anyone else, should visit the Élysée Palace, and he was even a little sorry for him because he had to go to lunches which Swann himself admitted","Whereupon Cottard, at once conforming in his mind to the literal interpretation of what Swann was saying, decided that invitations from M. Grévy were very little sought after, were sent out, in fact, into the highways and hedge-rows. And from that moment he never seemed at all surprised to hear that Swann, or anyone else, was 'always at the Elysée'; he even felt a little sorry for a man who had to go to luncheon-parties which, he himself admitted, were a bore."
"– C’est beau, n’est-ce pas, madame Françoise, de voir des jeunes gens qui ne tiennent pas à la vie ? disait le jardinier pour la faire « monter ».","""It's nice, isn't it, Madame Françoise, to see young people who don't want to live?"" said the gardener to make her ""go up"".","“A fine sight, isn’t it, Madame Françoise, all these youngsters with no care for their lives?” said the gardener to get a “rise” out of her.","""A fine sight, isn't it, Mme.

"Sans doute avait-il craint de leur laisser supposer qu’il n’était heureux de les voir que pour leur jouer de ses compositions. Et chaque fois que ma mère était revenue à la charge au cours de la visite, il avait répété plusieurs fois : « Mais je ne sais qui a mis cela sur le piano, ce n’est pas sa place », et avait détourné la conversation sur d’autres sujets, justement parce que ceux-là l’intéressaient moins. Sa seule passion était pour sa fille et celle-ci, qui avait l’air d’un garçon, paraissait si robuste qu’on ne pouvait s’empêcher de sourire en voyant les précautions que son père prenait pour elle, ayant toujours des châles supplémentaires à lui jeter sur les épaules. Ma grand’mère faisait remarquer quelle expression douce, délicate, presque timide passait souvent dans les regards de cette enfant si rude, dont le visage était semé de taches de son. Quand elle venait de prononcer une parole, elle l’entendait avec l’esprit de ceux à qui elle l’avait dite, s’alarmait des malentendus possibles et on voyait s’éclairer, se découper comme par transparence, sous la figure hommasse du « bon diable », les traits plus fins d’une jeune fille éplorée.","No doubt he was afraid of letting them suppose that he was only happy to see them to play his compositions for them. And each time my mother had come back to the charge during the visit, he had repeated several times: ""But I don't know who put that on the piano, it's not his place"", and had diverted the conversation on other subjects, precisely because those interested him less. His only passion was for his daughter, and the latter, who looked like a boy, seemed so robust that one could not help smiling at the precautions her father took for her, always having shawls. more to throw on his shoulders. My grandmother remarked what a gentle, delicate, almost shy expression often passed in the eyes of this child who was so rough, whose face was strewn with freckles. When she had just uttered a word, she heard it with the spirit of those to whom she had said it, was alarmed at possible misunderstandings and one saw light up, standing out as if by transparency, under the manlike face of the ""good devil"", the finer features of a tearful young girl.","No doubt he had been afraid of letting them think he was happy to see them only so that he could play them some of his compositions. And each time my mother had made a fresh attempt in the course of the visit, he had repeated several times: “I don’t know who put that on the piano, it doesn’t belong there,” and had diverted the conversation to other subjects, precisely because they interested him less. His only passion was for his daughter, and she, with her boyish appearance, seemed so robust that one could not help smiling at the sight of the precautions her father took for her sake, always having extra shawls to throw over her shoulders. My grandmother pointed out what a gentle, delicate, almost shy expression often came into the eyes of that rough-mannered child, whose face was covered with freckles. After she made a remark, she would hear it with the minds of the people to whom she had made it, would grow alarmed at possible misunderstandings, and one would see, illuminated, showing through as though by transparency, under the mannish face of the “good fellow” that she was, the more refined features of a young girl in tears.","He was afraid, no doubt, of letting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave him a chance of playing them some of his compositions. And every time that my mother, in the course of her visit, had returned to the subject of his playing, he had hurriedly protested: ""I cannot think who put that on the piano; it is not the proper place for it at all,"" and had turned the conversation aside to other topics, simply because those were of less interest to himself. His one and only passion was for his daughter, and she, with her somewhat boyish appearance, looked so robust that it was hard to restrain a smile when one saw the precautions her father used to take for her health, with spare shawls always in readiness to wrap around her shoulders. My grandmother had drawn our attention to the gentle, delicate, almost timid expression which might often be caught flitting across the face, dusted all over with freckles, of this otherwise stolid child. When she had spoken, she would at once take her own words in the sense in which her audience must have heard them, she would be alarmed at the possibility of a misunderstanding, and one would see, in clear outline, as though in a transparency, beneath the mannish face of the 'good sort' that she was, the finer features of a young woman in tears."
"Je la regardai, d’abord de ce regard qui n’est pas que le porte-parole des yeux, mais à la fenêtre duquel se penchent tous les sens, anxieux et pétrifiés, le regard qui voudrait toucher, capturer, emmener le corps qu’il regarde et l’âme avec lui ; puis, tant j’avais peur que d’une seconde à l’autre mon grand-père et mon père, apercevant cette jeune fille, me fissent éloigner en me disant de courir un peu devant eux, d’un second regard, inconsciemment supplicateur, qui tâchait de la forcer à faire attention à moi, à me connaître ! Elle jeta en avant et de côté ses pupilles pour prendre connaissance de mon grand’père et de mon père, et sans doute l’idée qu’elle en rapporta fut celle que nous étions ridicules, car elle se détourna, et d’un air indifférent et dédaigneux, se plaça de côté pour épargner à son visage d’être dans leur champ visuel ; et tandis que continuant à marcher et ne l’ayant pas aperçue, ils m’avaient dépassé, elle laissa ses regards filer de toute leur longueur dans ma direction, sans expression particulière, sans avoir l’air de me voir, mais avec une fixité et un sourire dissimulé, que je ne pouvais interpréter d’après les notions que l’on m’avait données sur la bonne éducation que comme une preuve d’outrageant mépris ; et sa main esquissait en même temps un geste indécent, auquel quand il était adressé en public à une personne qu’on ne connaissait pas, le petit dictionnaire de civilité que je portais en moi ne donnait qu’un seul sens, celui d’une intention insolente.","I looked at her, first with that look which is not only the mouthpiece of the eyes, but at the window of which lean all the senses, anxious and petrified, the look which would like to touch, capture, carry away the body that he looks and the soul with him; then, so much was I afraid that from one second to the next my grandfather and my father, seeing this young girl, would send me away, telling me to run a little in front of them, with a second look, unconsciously pleading , who was trying to force her to pay attention to me, to know me! She threw her pupils forward and to one side to take notice of my grandfather and my father, and no doubt the idea she brought back was that we were ridiculous, for she turned away, and with a indifferent and dismissive, stood aside to save his face from being in their field of vision; and while continuing to walk and not having seen her, they had passed me, she let her gaze run their full length in my direction, without particular expression, without seeming to see me, but with a fixed and a concealed smile, which I could only interpret from the notions I had been given of good breeding as a proof of outrageous contempt; and his hand sketched at the same time an indecent gesture, to which when it was addressed in public to a person whom one did not know, the little dictionary of civility which I carried in me gave only one meaning, that of a insolent intention.","I looked at her, at first with the sort of gaze that is not merely the messenger of the eyes, but a window at which all the senses lean out, anxious and petrified, a gaze that would like to touch the body it is looking at, capture it, take it away and the soul along with it; then, so afraid was I that at any second my grandfather and my father, noticing the girl, would send me off, telling me to run on a little ahead of them, with a second sort of gaze, one that was unconsciously supplicating, that tried to force her to pay attention to me, to know me! She cast her eyes forward and sideways in order to take stock of my grandfather and father, and no doubt the impression she formed of them was that we were absurd, for she turned away, and, with an indifferent and disdainful look, placed herself at an angle to spare her face from being in their field of vision; and while they, continuing to walk on without noticing her, passed beyond me, she allowed her glances to stream out at full length in my direction, without any particular expression, without appearing to see me, but with a concentration and a secret smile that I could only interpret, according to the notions of good breeding instilled in me, as a sign of insulting contempt; and at the same time her hand sketched an indecent gesture for which, when it was directed in public at a person one did not know, the little dictionary of manners I carried inside me supplied only one meaning, that of intentional insolence.","I gazed at her, at first with that gaze which is not merely a messenger from the eyes, but in whose window all the senses assemble and lean out, petrified and anxious, that gaze which would fain reach, touch, capture, bear off in triumph the body at which it is aimed, and the soul with the body; then (so frightened was I lest at any moment my grandfather and father, catching sight of the girl, might tear me away from her, by making me run on in front of them) with another, an unconsciously appealing look, whose object was to force her to pay attention to me, to see, to know me. She cast a glance forwards and sideways, so as to take stock of my grandfather and father, and doubtless the impression she formed of them was that we were all absurd people , for she turned away with an indifferent and contemptuous air, withdrew herself so as to spare her face the indignity of remaining within their field of vision; and while they, continuing to walk on without noticing her, had overtaken and passed me, she allowed her eyes to wander, over the space that lay between us, in my direction, without any particular expression, without appearing to have seen me, but with an intensity, a half-hidden smile which I was unable to interpret, according to the instruction I had received in the ways of good breeding, save as a mark of infinite disgust; and her hand, at the same time, sketched in the air an indelicate gesture, for which, when it was addressed in public to a person whom one did not know, the little dictionary of manners which I carried in my mind supplied only one meaning, namely, a deliberate insult."

Comme MmeVerdurin, malgré de petites exagérations un peu risibles, a un amour sincère de la peinture, de la musique ! Quelle passion pour les œuvres, quel désir de faire plaisir aux artistes ! Elle se fait une idée inexacte des gens du monde ; mais avec cela que le monde n’en a pas une plus fausse encore, des milieux artistes ! Peut-être n’ai-je pas de grands besoins intellectuels à assouvir dans la conversation, mais je me plais parfaitement bien avec Cottard, quoiqu’il fasse des calembours ineptes.

How Mrs. Verdurin, in spite of slightly laughable little exaggerations, has a sincere love of painting, of music! What a passion for the works, what a desire to please the artists! She has an inexact idea of the people of society; but with that the world does not have an even more false one, artistic circles! Perhaps I do not have great intellectual needs to satisfy in conversation, but I am perfectly well with Cottard, although he plays inane puns.

Her ideas about some of the people one knows are not quite right, but then their ideas about artistic circles are altogether wrong! Possibly I make no great intellectual demands upon conversation, but I am perfectly happy talking to Cottard, although he does trot out those idiotic puns.

"Le docteur Cottard ne savait jamais d’une façon certaine de quel ton il devait répondre à quelqu’un, si son interlocuteur voulait rire ou était sérieux. Et à tout hasard il ajoutait à toutes ses expressions de physionomie l’offre d’un sourire conditionnel et provisoire dont la finesse expectante le disculperait du reproche de naïveté, si le propos qu’on lui avait tenu se trouvait avoir été facétieux. Mais comme pour faire face à l’hypothèse opposée il n’osait pas laisser ce sourire s’affirmer nettement sur son visage, on y voyait flotter perpétuellement une incertitude où se lisait la question qu’il n’osait pas poser : « Dites-vous cela pour de bon ? » Il n’était pas plus assuré de la façon dont il devait se comporter dans la rue, et même en général dans la vie, que dans un salon, et on le voyait opposer aux passants, aux voitures, aux événements un malicieux sourire qui ôtait d’avance à son attitude toute impropriété, puisqu’il prouvait, si elle n’était pas de mise, qu’il le savait bien et que s’il avait adopté celle-là, c’était par plaisanterie.","Doctor Cottard never knew for sure in what tone he should respond to someone, whether his interlocutor wanted to laugh or was serious. And on the off chance that he added to all his facial expressions the offer of a conditional and provisional smile whose expectant delicacy would exculpate him from the reproach of naivety, if the remark that had been made to him turned out to have been facetious. But as if to face up to the opposite hypothesis, he dared not let that smile stand out clearly on his face, one could see a perpetual uncertainty floating there, in which could be read the question he dared not ask: ""Say- you this for good? He was no more sure of the way he should behave in the street, and even in life in general, than in a drawing-room, and one saw him oppose to passers-by, to cars, to events, a mischievous smile which removed all impropriety from his attitude in advance, since he proved, if it was not in order, that he knew it well and that if he had adopted that one, it was as a joke.","Dr. Cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to answer someone, whether the person addressing him wanted to make a joke or was serious. And just in case, he would add to each of his facial expressions the offer of a conditional and tentative smile whose expectant shrewdness would exculpate him from the reproach of naïveté, if the remark that had been made to him was found to have been facetious. But since, so as to respond to the opposite hypothesis, he did not dare allow that smile to declare itself distinctly on his face, one saw an uncertainty perpetually floating upon it in which could be read the question he did not dare ask: “Are you saying this in earnest?” He was no more sure how he ought to behave in the street, and even in life generally, than in a drawing room, and he could be seen greeting passersby, carriages, and any minor event that occurred with the same ironic smile that removed all impropriety from his attitude in advance, since he was proving that if the attitude was not a fashionable one he was well aware of it and that if he had adopted it, it was as a joke.","Cottard, the young pianist and his aunt, and the painter then in favour, while these were joined, in the course of the evening, by several more of the 'faithful.' Dr. Cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to reply to any observation, or whether the speaker was jesting or in earnest. And so in any event he would embellish all his facial expressions with the offer of a conditional, a provisional smile whose expectant subtlety would exonerate him from the charge of being a simpleton, if the remark addressed to him should turn out to have been facetious. But as he must also be prepared to face the alternative, he never dared to allow this smile a definite expression on his features, and you would see there a perpetually flickering uncertainty, in which you might decipher the question that he never dared to ask: ""Do you really mean that?"" He was no more confident of the manner in which he ought to conduct himself in the street, or indeed in life generally, than he was in a drawing-room; and he might be seen greeting passers-by, carriages, and anything that occurred with a malicious smile which absolved his subsequent behaviour of all impropriety, since it proved, if it should turn out unsuited to the occasion, that he was well aware of that, and that if he had assumed a smile, the jest was a secret of his own."
"L’angoisse que je venais d’éprouver, je pensais que Swann s’en serait bien moqué s’il avait lu ma lettre et en avait deviné le but ; or, au contraire, comme je l’ai appris plus tard, une angoisse semblable fut le tourment de longues années de sa vie, et personne aussi bien que lui peut-être, n’aurait pu me comprendre ; lui, cette angoisse qu’il y a à sentir l’être qu’on aime dans un lieu de plaisir où l’on n’est pas, où l’on ne peut pas le rejoindre, c’est l’amour qui la lui a fait connaître, l’amour auquel elle est en quelque sorte prédestinée, par lequel elle sera accaparée, spécialisée ; mais quand, comme pour moi, elle est entrée en nous avant qu’il ait encore fait son apparition dans notre vie, elle flotte en l’attendant, vague et libre, sans affectation déterminée, au service un jour d’un sentiment, le lendemain d’un autre, tantôt de la tendresse filiale ou de l’amitié pour un camarade. – Et la joie avec laquelle je fis mon premier apprentissage quand Françoise revint me dire que ma lettre serait remise, Swann l’avait bien connue aussi, cette joie trompeuse que nous donne quelque ami, quelque parent de la femme que nous aimons, quand arrivant à l’hôtel ou au théâtre où elle se trouve, pour quelque bal, redoute, ou première où il va la retrouver, cet ami nous aperçoit errant dehors, attendant désespérément quelque occasion de communiquer avec elle. Il nous reconnaît, nous aborde familièrement, nous demande ce que nous faisons là. Et comme nous inventons que nous avons quelque chose d’urgent à dire à sa parente ou amie, il nous assure que rien n’est plus simple, nous fait entrer dans le vestibule et nous promet de nous l’envoyer avant cinq minutes. Que nous l’aimons – comme en ce moment j’aimais Françoise – l’intermédiaire bien intentionné qui d’un mot vient de nous rendre supportable, humaine et presque propice la fête inconcevable, infernale, au sein de laquelle nous croyions que des tourbillons ennemis, pervers et délicieux entraînaient loin de nous, la faisant rire de nous, celle que nous aimons. Si nous en jugeons par lui, le parent qui nous a accosté et qui est lui aussi un des initiés des cruels mystères, les autres invités de la fête ne doivent rien avoir de bien démoniaque. Ces heures inaccessibles et suppliciantes où elle allait goûter des plaisirs inconnus, voici que par une brèche inespérée nous y pénétrons ; voici qu’un des moments dont la succession les aurait composées, un moment aussi réel que les autres, même peut-être plus important pour nous, parce que notre maîtresse y est plus mêlée, nous nous le représentons, nous le possédons, nous y intervenons, nous l’avons créé presque : le moment où on va lui dire que nous sommes là, en bas. Et sans doute les autres moments de la fête ne devaient pas être d’une essence bien différente de celui-là, ne devaient rien avoir de plus délicieux et qui dût tant nous faire souffrir, puisque l’ami bienveillant nous a dit : « Mais elle sera ravie de descendre ! Cela lui fera beaucoup plus de plaisir de causer avec vous que de s’ennuyer là-haut. » Hélas !","The anguish I had just experienced, I thought Swann would have made fun of if he had read my letter and guessed its purpose; but, on the contrary, as I later learned, a similar anguish was the torment of long years of his life, and no one so well as he perhaps could have understood me; him, this anguish that there is to feel the being that one loves in a place of pleasure where one is not, where one cannot join him, it is love that made her know the love to which she is in some way predestined, by which she will be monopolized, specialized; but when, as for me, it has entered us before it has yet made its appearance in our lives, it floats waiting for it, vague and free, without determined affectation, at the service one day of a feeling, the tomorrow from another, sometimes from filial tenderness or friendship for a comrade. “And the joy with which I did my first apprenticeship when Françoise came back to tell me that my letter would be delivered, Swann had known it well too, that deceptive joy which some friend, some relative of the woman we love, gives us when arriving at the hotel or at the theater where she is, for some ball, redoubt, or premiere where he is going to find her, this friend sees us wandering outside, desperately waiting for some opportunity to communicate with her. He recognizes us, approaches us familiarly, asks us what we are doing there. And as we imagine that we have something urgent to say to his relative or friend, he assures us that nothing could be simpler, ushers us into the vestibule and promises to send it to us within five minutes. That we love him – as at this moment I loved Françoise – the well-intentioned intermediary who with a word has just made us bearable, human and almost propitious to the inconceivable, infernal party, within which we believed only whirlwinds enemies, perverse and delicious dragged away from us, making her laugh at us, the one we love. If we judge by him, the parent who accosted us and who is also one of the initiates of the cruel mysteries, the other guests of the party must have nothing very demonic about them. Those inaccessible and agonizing hours when she was going to taste unknown pleasures, here we enter through an unexpected breach; here is one of the moments whose succession would have composed them, a moment as real as the others, even perhaps more important for us, because our mistress is more involved in it, we represent it to ourselves, we possess it, we let's intervene, we have almost created it: the moment when we are going to tell it that we are down there. And no doubt the other moments of the party were not to be of a very different essence from this one, were not to have anything more delicious and which should have made us suffer so much, since the benevolent friend said to us: ""But she will be delighted to come down! It will give him much more pleasure to talk with you than to be bored up there. Alas!","I thought Swann would surely have laughed at the anguish I had just suffered if he had read my letter and guessed its purpose; yet, on the contrary, as I learned later, a similar anguish was the torment of long years of his life and no one, perhaps, could have understood me as well as he; in his case, the anguish that comes from feeling that the person you love is in a place of amusement where you are not, where you cannot join her, came to him through love, to which it is in some sense predestined, by which it will be hoarded, appropriated; but when, as in my case, this anguish enters us before love has made its appearance in our life, it drifts as it waits for it, vague and free, without a particular assignment, at the service of one feeling one day, of another the next, sometimes of filial tenderness or affection for a friend. And the joy with which I served my first apprenticeship when Françoise came back to tell me my letter would be delivered Swann too had known well, that deceptive joy given to us by some friend, some relative of the woman we love when, arriving at the house or theater where she is, for some dance, gala evening, or premiere at which he is going to see her, this friend notices us wandering outside, desperately awaiting some opportunity to communicate with her. He recognizes us, speaks to us familiarly, asks us what we are doing there. And when we invent the story that we have something urgent to say to his relative or friend, he assures us that nothing could be simpler, leads us into the hall, and promises to send her to us in five minutes. How we love him, as at that moment I loved Françoise—the wellintentioned intermediary who with a single word has just made tolerable, human, and almost propitious the unimaginable, infernal festivity into the thick of which we had been imagining that hostile, perverse, and exquisite vortices of pleasure were carrying away from us and inspiring with derisive laughter the woman we love! If we are to judge by him, the relative who has come up to us and is himself also one of the initiates in the cruel mysteries, the other guests at the party cannot have anything very demoniacal about them. Those inaccessible and excruciating hours during which she was about to enjoy unknown pleasures—now, through an unexpected breach, we are entering them; now, one of the moments which, in succession, would have composed those hours, a moment as real as the others, perhaps even more important to us, because our mistress is more involved in it, we can picture to ourselves, we possess it, we are taking part in it, we have created it, almost: the moment in which he will tell her we are here, downstairs. And no doubt the other moments of the party would not have been essentially very different from this one, would not have had anything more delectable about them that should make us suffer so, since the kind friend has said to us: “Why, she’ll be delighted to come down! It’ll be much nicer for her to chat with you than to be bored up there.” Alas!","As for the agony through which I had just passed, I imagined that Swann would have laughed heartily at it if he had read my letter and had guessed its purpose; whereas, on the contrary, as I was to learn in due course, a similar anguish had been the bane of his life for many years, and no one perhaps could have understood my feelings at that moment so well as himself; to him, that anguish which lies in knowing that the creature one adores is in some place of enjoyment where oneself is not and cannot follow—to him that anguish came through Love, to which it is in a sense predestined, by which it must be equipped and adapted; but when, as had befallen me, such an anguish possesses one's soul before Love has yet entered into one's life, then it must drift, awaiting Love's coming, vague and free, without precise attachment, at the disposal of one sentiment to-day, of another to-morrow, of filial piety or affection for a comrade. And the joy with which I first bound myself apprentice, when Françoise returned to tell me that my letter would be delivered; Swann, too, had known well that false joy which a friend can give us, or some relative of the woman we love, when on his arrival at the house or theatre where she is to be found, for some ball or party or 'first-night' at which he is to meet her, he sees us wandering outside, desperately awaiting some opportunity of communicating with her. He recognises us, greets us familiarly, and asks what we are doing there. And when we invent a story of having some urgent message to give to his relative or friend, he assures us that nothing could be more simple, takes us in at the door, and promises to send her down to us in five minutes. How much we love him—as at that moment I loved Françoise—the good-natured intermediary who by a single word has made supportable, human, almost propitious the inconceivable, infernal scene of gaiety in the thick of which we had been imagining swarms of enemies, perverse and seductive, beguiling away from us, even making laugh at us, the woman whom we love. If we are to judge of them by him, this relative who has accosted us and who is himself an initiate in those cruel mysteries, then the other guests cannot be so very demoniacal. Those inaccessible and torturing hours into which she had gone to taste of unknown pleasures—behold, a breach in the wall, and we are through it. Behold, one of the moments whose series will go to make up their sum, a moment as genuine as the rest, if not actually more important to ourself because our mistress is more intensely a part of it; we picture it to ourselves, we possess it, we intervene upon it, almost we have created it: namely, the moment in which he goes to tell her that we are waiting there below. And very probably the other moments of the party will not be essentially different, will contain nothing else so exquisite or so well able to make us suffer, since this kind friend has assured us that ""Of course, she will be delighted to come down! It will be far more amusing for her to talk to you than to be bored up there."" Alas!"

"Ni elle d’ailleurs ni mon père ne semblaient non plus trouver à parler des grands-parents de Swann, du titre d’agent de change honoraire, un plaisir qui passât tous les autres. Mon imagination avait isolé et consacré dans le Paris social une certaine famille, comme elle avait fait dans le Paris de pierre pour une certaine maison dont elle avait sculpté la porte cochère et rendu précieuses les fenêtres. Mais ces ornements, j’étais seul à les voir. De même que mon père et ma mère trouvaient la maison qu’habitait Swann pareille aux autres maisons construites en même temps dans le quartier du Bois, de même la famille de Swann leur semblait du même genre que beaucoup d’autres familles d’agents de change. Ils la jugeaient plus ou moins favorablement selon le degré où elle avait participé à des mérites communs au reste de l’univers et ne lui trouvaient rien d’unique. Ce qu’au contraire ils y appréciaient, ils le rencontraient à un degré égal, ou plus élevé, ailleurs.","Nor did she or my father seem to find talking about Swann's grandparents, the title of honorary stockbroker, a pleasure that surpassed all the others. My imagination had isolated and consecrated a certain family in social Paris, as it had done in stone Paris for a certain house whose carriage entrance it had sculpted and the windows rendered precious. But these ornaments, I was the only one to see them. Just as my father and my mother found the house in which Swann lived similar to the other houses built at the same time in the Bois district, so the Swann family seemed to them to be of the same kind as many other families of security guards. exchange. They judged her more or less favorably according to the degree to which she had participated in merits common to the rest of the universe and found nothing unique in her. What, on the contrary, they appreciated there, they encountered in an equal or greater degree elsewhere.","Nor did she or my father either seem to find, in talking about Swann’s grandparents, about the title of honorary stockbroker, a pleasure that surpassed all others.

But I was the only one who could see these ornaments. In the same way that my father and mother regarded the house that Swann lived in as similar to the other houses built at the same time in the neighborhood of the Bois, so Swann’s family seemed to them of the same sort as many other families of stockbrokers.

My imagination had isolated and consecrated in the social Paris a certain family, just as it had set apart in the structural Paris a certain house, on whose porch it had fashioned sculptures and made its windows precious. But these ornaments I alone had eyes to see. Just as my father and mother looked upon the house in which Swann lived as one that closely resembled the other houses built at the same period in the neighbourhood of the Bois, so Swann's family seemed to them to be in the same category as many other families of stockbrokers. Their judgment was more or less favourable according to the extent to which the family in question shared in merits that were common to the rest of the universe, and there was about it nothing that they could call unique. What, on the other hand, they did appreciate in the Swanns they found in equal, if not in greater measure elsewhere."
"Même cet amour pour une phrase musicale sembla un instant devoir amorcer chez Swann la possibilité d’une sorte de rajeunissement. Depuis si longtemps il avait renoncé à appliquer sa vie à un but idéal et la bornait à la poursuite de satisfactions quotidiennes, qu’il croyait, sans jamais se le dire formellement, que cela ne changerait plus jusqu’à sa mort ; bien plus, ne se sentant plus d’idées élevées dans l’esprit, il avait cessé de croire à leur réalité, sans pouvoir non plus la nier tout à fait. Aussi avait-il pris l’habitude de se réfugier dans des pensées sans importance et qui lui permettaient de laisser de côté le fond des choses. De même qu’il ne se demandait pas s’il n’eût pas mieux fait de ne pas aller dans le monde, mais en revanche savait avec certitude que s’il avait accepté une invitation il devait s’y rendre, et que s’il ne faisait pas de visite après il lui fallait laisser des cartes, de même dans sa conversation il s’efforçait de ne jamais exprimer avec cœur une opinion intime sur les choses, mais de fournir des détails matériels qui valaient en quelque sorte par eux-mêmes et lui permettaient de ne pas donner sa mesure. Il était extrêmement précis pour une recette de cuisine, pour la date de la naissance ou de la mort d’un peintre, pour la nomenclature de ses œuvres. Parfois, malgré tout, il se laissait aller à émettre un jugement sur une œuvre, sur une manière de comprendre la vie, mais il donnait alors à ses paroles un ton ironique comme s’il n’adhérait pas tout entier à ce qu’il disait. Or, comme certains valétudinaires chez qui, tout d’un coup, un pays où ils sont arrivés, un régime différent, quelquefois une évolution organique, spontanée et mystérieuse, semblent amener une telle régression de leur mal qu’ils commencent à envisager la possibilité inespérée de commencer sur le tard une vie toute différente, Swann trouvait en lui, dans le souvenir de la phrase qu’il avait entendue, dans certaines sonates qu’il s’était fait jouer, pour voir s’il ne l’y découvrirait pas, la présence d’une de ces réalités invisibles auxquelles il avait cessé de croire et auxquelles, comme si la musique avait eu sur la sécheresse morale dont il souffrait une sorte d’influence élective, il se sentait de nouveau le désir et presque la force de consacrer sa vie. Mais n’étant pas arrivé à savoir de qui était l’œuvre qu’il avait entendue, il n’avait pu se la procurer et avait fini par l’oublier. Il avait bien rencontré dans la semaine quelques personnes qui se trouvaient comme lui à cette soirée et les avait interrogées ; mais plusieurs étaient arrivées après la musique ou parties avant ; certaines pourtant étaient là pendant qu’on l’exécutait, mais étaient allées causer dans un autre salon, et d’autres restées à écouter n’avaient pas entendu plus que les premières. Quant aux maîtres de maison, ils savaient que c’était une œuvre nouvelle que les artistes qu’ils avaient engagés avaient demandé à jouer ; ceux-ci étant partis en tournée, Swann ne put pas en savoir davantage. Il avait bien des amis musiciens, mais tout en se rappelant le plaisir spécial et intraduisible que lui avait fait la phrase, en voyant devant ses yeux les formes qu’elle dessinait, il était pourtant incapable de la leur chanter. Puis il cessa d’y penser.","Even this love for a musical phrase seemed for a moment to spark the possibility of a kind of rejuvenation in Swann. For so long he had renounced applying his life to an ideal goal and confined it to the pursuit of daily satisfactions, that he believed, without ever saying it formally, that this would not change any more until his death; moreover, no longer feeling any higher ideas in his mind, he had ceased to believe in their reality, without being able to deny it altogether either. So he had gotten into the habit of taking refuge in thoughts of no importance and which allowed him to leave aside the bottom of things. Just as he did not ask himself whether he would not have done better not to go into the world, but on the other hand knew with certainty that if he had accepted an invitation he must go there, and that his 'he made no visit afterwards he had to leave cards, likewise in his conversation he endeavored never to express with heart an intimate opinion on things, but to supply material details which were somehow worth by them themselves and allowed him not to give his measure. It was extremely precise for a cooking recipe, for the date of birth or death of a painter, for the nomenclature of his works. Sometimes, despite everything, he allowed himself to pass judgment on a work, on a way of understanding life, but then he gave his words an ironic tone as if he did not entirely adhere to what he was saying. However, like certain valetudinarians in whom, all of a sudden, a country where they arrived, a different regime, sometimes an organic, spontaneous and mysterious evolution, seem to bring about such a regression of their disease that they begin to consider the possibility unexpected of starting a completely different life later in life, Swann found in himself, in the memory of the phrase he had heard, in certain sonatas he had had himself played, to see if he would not discover it there. not, the presence of one of those invisible realities in which he had ceased to believe and in which, as if the music had had a sort of elective influence over the moral aridity from which he suffered, he once again felt the desire and almost the strength to dedicate his life. But not having been able to find out whose work he had heard was, he had not been able to obtain it and had ended up forgetting it. He had certainly met a few people during the week who happened to be like him at this party and had questioned them; but several had arrived after the music or left before; some, however, were there while it was being performed, but had gone to talk in another drawing-room, and others who had remained listening had heard no more than the first. As for the masters of the house, they knew that it was a new work that the artists they had hired had asked to be played; these having gone on tour, Swann could not find out more. He had many musical friends, but while remembering the special and untranslatable pleasure the phrase had given him, seeing before his eyes the shapes it drew, he was nevertheless unable to sing it to them. Then he stopped thinking about it.","It even seemed, for a moment, that this love for a phrase of music would have to open in Swann the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation. He had for so long given up directing his life toward an ideal goal and limited it to the pursuit of everyday satisfactions that he believed, without ever saying so formally to himself, that this would not change as long as he lived; much worse, since his mind no longer entertained any lofty ideas, he had ceased to believe in their reality, though without being able to deny it altogether. Thus he had acquired the habit of taking refuge in unimportant thoughts that allowed him to ignore the fundamental essence of things. Just as he did not ask himself if it would have been better for him not to go into society, but on the other hand knew quite certainly that if he had accepted an invitation he ought to go and that if he did not pay a call afterward he must at least leave cards, so in his conversation he endeavored never to express with any warmth a personal opinion about things, but to furnish material details that had some sort of value in themselves and allowed him not to show his real capacities. He was extremely precise when it came to the recipe for a dish, the date of a painter’s birth or death, the nomenclature of his works. Now and then, despite everything, he went so far as to utter a judgment on a work, on someone’s interpretation of life, but he would then give his remarks an ironic tone, as if he did not entirely subscribe to what he was saying. Now, like certain confirmed invalids in whom, suddenly, a country they have arrived in, a different diet, sometimes a spontaneous and mysterious organic development seem to bring on such a regression of their ailment that they begin to envisage the unhoped-for possibility of belatedly starting a completely different life, Swann found within himself, in the recollection of the phrase he had heard, in certain sonatas he asked people to play for him, to see if he would not discover it in them, the presence of one of those invisible realities in which he had ceased to believe and to which, as if the music had had a sort of sympathetic influence on the moral dryness from which he suffered, he felt in himself once again the desire and almost the strength to devote his life. But, since he had not succeeded in finding out who had composed the work he had heard, he had not been able to acquire it for himself and had ended by forgetting it. True, during the week he had encountered several people who had been with him at that party and he had asked them about it; but many had arrived after the music or left before; some were indeed there while it was performed but had gone into the other drawing room to talk, and others, who had stayed to listen, had heard no more of it than had the first group. As for the master and mistress of the house, they knew it was a recent work which the musicians whom they had hired had asked to play; since the latter had gone off on a tour, Swann could not find out anything more. He had many friends who were musicians, but though he recalled the special and inexpressible pleasure the phrase had given him, and saw before his eyes the shapes it outlined, he was not able to sing it for them. Then he stopped thinking about it.","Indeed this passion for a phrase of music seemed, in the first few months, to be bringing into Swann's life the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation. He had so long since ceased to direct his course towards any ideal goal, and had confined himself to the pursuit of ephemeral satisfactions, that he had come to believe, though without ever formally stating his belief even to himself, that he would remain all his life in that condition, which death alone could alter. More than this, since his mind no longer entertained any lofty ideals, he had ceased to believe in (although he could not have expressly denied) their reality. He had grown also into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations, which allowed him to set on one side matters of fundamental importance. Just as he had never stopped to ask himself whether he would not have done better by not going into society, knowing very well that if he had accepted an invitation he must put in an appearance, and that afterwards, if he did not actually call, he must at least leave cards upon his hostess; so in his conversation he took care never to express with any warmth a personal opinion about a thing, but instead would supply facts and details which had a value of a sort in themselves, and excused him from shewing how much he really knew. He would be extremely precise about the recipe for a dish, the dates of a painter's birth and death, and the titles of his works. Sometimes, in spite of himself, he would let himself go so far as to utter a criticism of a work of art, or of some one's interpretation of life, but then he would cloak his words in a tone of irony, as though he did not altogether associate himself with what he was saying. But now, like a confirmed invalid whom, all of a sudden, a change of air and surroundings, or a new course of treatment, or, as sometimes happens, an organic change in himself, spontaneous and unaccountable, seems to have so far recovered from his malady that he begins to envisage the possibility, hitherto beyond all hope, of starting to lead—and better late than never— a wholly different life, Swann found in himself, in the memory of the phrase that he had heard, in certain other sonatas which he had made people play over to him, to see whether he might not, perhaps, discover his phrase among them, the presence of one of those invisible realities in which he had ceased to believe, but to which, as though the music had had upon the moral barrenness from which he was suffering a sort of recreative influence, he was conscious once again of a desire, almost, indeed, of the power to consecrate his life. But, never having managed to find out whose work it was that he had heard played that evening, he had been unable to procure a copy, and finally had forgotten the quest. He had indeed, in the course of the next few days, encountered several of the people who had been at the party with him, and had questioned them; but most of them had either arrived after or left before the piece was played; some had indeed been in the house, but had gone into another room to talk, and those who had stayed to listen had no clearer impression than the rest. As for his hosts, they knew that it was a recently published work which the musicians whom they had engaged for the evening had asked to be allowed to play; but, as these last were now on tour somewhere, Swann could learn nothing further. He had, of course, a number of musical friends, but, vividly as he could recall the exquisite and inexpressible pleasure which the little phrase had given him, and could see, still, before his eyes the forms that it had traced in outline, he was quite incapable of humming over to them the air. And so, at last, he ceased to think of it."
"– Il y a dans les nuages ce soir des violets et des bleus bien beaux, n’est-ce pas, mon compagnon, dit-il à mon père, un bleu surtout plus floral qu’aérien, un bleu de cinéraire, qui surprend dans le ciel. Et ce petit nuage rose n’a-t-il pas aussi un teint de fleur, d’œillet ou d’hydrangéa ? Il n’y a guère que dans la Manche, entre Normandie et Bretagne, que j’ai pu faire de plus riches observations sur cette sorte de règne végétal de l’atmosphère. Là-bas, près de Balbec, près de ces lieux sauvages, il y a une petite baie d’une douceur charmante où le coucher de soleil du pays d’Auge, le coucher de soleil rouge et or que je suis loin de dédaigner, d’ailleurs, est sans caractère, insignifiant ; mais dans cette atmosphère humide et douce s’épanouissent le soir en quelques instants de ces bouquets célestes, bleus et roses, qui sont incomparables et qui mettent souvent des heures à se faner. D’autres s’effeuillent tout de suite, et c’est alors plus beau encore de voir le ciel entier que jonche la dispersion d’innombrables pétales soufrés ou roses. Dans cette baie, dite d’opale, les plages d’or semblent plus douces encore pour être attachées comme de blondes Andromèdes à ces terribles rochers des côtes voisines, à ce rivage funèbre, fameux par tant de naufrages, où tous les hivers bien des barques trépassent au péril de la mer. Balbec ! la plus antique ossature géologique de notre sol, vraiment Ar-mor, la mer, la fin de la terre, la région maudite qu’Anatole France – un enchanteur que devrait lire notre petit ami – a si bien peinte, sous ses brouillards éternels, comme le véritable pays des Cimmériens, dans l’Odyssée. De Balbec surtout, où déjà des hôtels se construisent, superposés au sol antique et charmant qu’ils n’altèrent pas, quel délice d’excursionner à deux pas dans ces régions primitives et si belles.","- There are very beautiful violets and blues in the clouds tonight, aren't there, my companion, he said to my father, a blue above all more floral than airy, a blue of cineraria, which surprises in the sky. And doesn't this little pink cloud also have the complexion of a flower, a carnation or a hydrangea? It is only in the English Channel, between Normandy and Brittany, that I have been able to make richer observations on this sort of vegetable kingdom of the atmosphere. Over there, near Balbec, near these wild places, there is a small bay of charming sweetness where the sunset of the Pays d'Auge, the red and gold sunset which I am far from despising, moreover, is without character, insignificant; but in this humid and sweet atmosphere bloom in the evening in a few moments those celestial bouquets, blue and pink, which are incomparable and which often take hours to fade. Others flake off right away, and it is then even more beautiful to see the entire sky strewn with the dispersion of countless sulfur or pink petals. In this so-called opal bay, the golden beaches seem even sweeter for being attached like fair Andromedas to these terrible rocks of the neighboring coasts, to this funereal shore, famous for so many shipwrecks, where every winter many boats pass away at the peril of the sea. Balbec! the most ancient geological skeleton of our soil, truly Ar-mor, the sea, the end of the earth, the accursed region that Anatole France – an enchanter that our little friend should read – painted so well, under its eternal mists, as the real country of the Cimmerians, in the Odyssey. From Balbec especially, where hotels are already being built, superimposed on the ancient and charming ground that they do not alter, what a delight to take a short excursion in these primitive and so beautiful regions.","“There are very lovely violets and blues in the clouds this evening, are there not, my friend,” he said to my father, “a blue, especially, more flowery than airy, the blue of a cineraria, which is surprising in the sky. And that little pink cloud, too, has it not the tint of some flower, a sweet william or hydrangea? Nowhere, perhaps, but on the Channel, between Normandy and Britanny, have I made richer observations of this sort of plant kingdom of the atmosphere. There, near Balbec, near those wild areas, there is a little bay, charmingly gentle, where the sunsets of the Auge country, the red and gold sunsets which I do not in the least disdain, let it be said, are characterless, insignificant; but in that damp and mild atmosphere, in the evening, you will see blooming in the space of a few instants celestial bouquets of blue and pink which are incomparable and often last for hours before they fade. There are others that lose their blossoms immediately, and then it is even lovelier to see the entire sky strewn with the scattering of their countless petals, sulfur or pink. In this bay, which they call Opal Bay, the golden beaches seem gentler still because they are chained like blond Andromedas38 to those terrible rocks of the nearby coast, to that gloomy shore, famed for the number of its wrecks, where every winter many a vessel is lost to the perils of the sea. Balbec! The most ancient geological skeleton of our soil, truly Ar-mor, the Sea,39 the land ’s end , the accursed region which Anatole France40—an enchanter whom our little friend here ought to read—has painted so well, under its eternal fogs, like the veritable country of the Cimmerians in the Odyssey.41 From Balbec especially, where they are already building hotels, superimposing them upon the ancient and charming soil which they cannot change, what a delight it is to go for excursions just a step or two away through regions so primitive and so lovely!”","""There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which are very beautiful, are they not, my friend?"" he said to my father. "" Especially a blue which is far more floral than atmospheric, a cineraria blue, which it is surprising to see in the sky. And that little pink cloud there, has it not just the tint of some flower, a carnation or hydrangea? Nowhere, perhaps, except on the shores of the English Channel, where Normandy merges into Brittany, have I been able to find such copious examples of what you might call a vegetable kingdom in the clouds. Down there, close to Balbec, among all those places which are still so uncivilised, there is a little bay, charmingly quiet, where the sunsets of the Auge Valley, those red-and-gold sunsets (which, all the same, I am very far from despising) seem commonplace and insignificant; for in that moist and gentle atmosphere these heavenly flower-beds will break into blossom, in a few moments, in the evenings, incomparably lovely, and often lasting for hours before they fade. Others shed their leaves at once, and then it is more beautiful still to see the sky strewn with the scattering of their innumerable petals, sulphurous yellow and rosy red. In that bay, which they call the Opal Bay, the golden sands appear more charming still from being fastened, like fair Andromeda, to those terrible rocks of the surrounding coast, to that funereal shore, famed for the number of its wrecks, where every winter many a brave vessel falls a victim to the perils of the sea. Balbec! the oldest bone in the geological skeleton that underlies our soil, the true Armor, the sea, the land's end, the accursed region which Anatole France—an enchanter whose works our young friend ought to read—has so well depicted, beneath its eternal fogs, as though it were indeed the land of the Cimmerians in the Odyssey. Balbec; yes, they are building hotels there now, superimposing them upon its ancient and charming soil, which they are powerless to alter; how delightful it is, down there, to be able to step out at once into regions so primitive and so entrancing."""
"Souvent elle avait des embarras d’argent et, pressée par une dette, le priait de lui venir en aide. Il en était heureux comme de tout ce qui pouvait donner à Odette une grande idée de l’amour qu’il avait pour elle, ou simplement une grande idée de son influence, de l’utilité dont il pouvait lui être. Sans doute si on lui avait dit au début : « c’est ta situation qui lui plaît », et maintenant : « c’est pour ta fortune qu’elle t’aime », il ne l’aurait pas cru, et n’aurait pas été d’ailleurs très mécontent qu’on se la figurât tenant à lui – qu’on les sentît unis l’un à l’autre – par quelque chose d’aussi fort que le snobisme ou l’argent. Mais, même s’il avait pensé que c’était vrai, peut-être n’eût-il pas souffert de découvrir à l’amour d’Odette pour lui cet état plus durable que l’agrément ou les qualités qu’elle pouvait lui trouver : l’intérêt, l’intérêt qui empêcherait de venir jamais le jour où elle aurait pu être tentée de cesser de le voir. Pour l’instant, en la comblant de présents, en lui rendant des services, il pouvait se reposer sur des avantages extérieurs à sa personne, à son intelligence, du soin épuisant de lui plaire par lui-même. Et cette volupté d’être amoureux, de ne vivre que d’amour, de la réalité de laquelle il doutait parfois, le prix dont en somme il la payait, en dilettante, de sensations immatérielles, lui en augmentait la valeur – comme on voit des gens incertains si le spectacle de la mer et le bruit de ses vagues sont délicieux, s’en convaincre ainsi que de la rare qualité de leurs goûts désintéressés, en louant cent francs par jour la chambre d’hôtel qui leur permet de les goûter.","Often she was in financial difficulties and, pressed by a debt, begged him to come to her aid. He was happy with it as with anything that could give Odette a great idea of the love he had for her, or simply a great idea of his influence, of the usefulness he could be to her. No doubt if he had been told at the beginning: ""it's your situation that she likes"", and now: ""it's for your fortune that she loves you"", he would not have believed it, and would not have would not have been very unhappy, moreover, that people imagined her to be attached to him – that they felt united to one another – by something as strong as snobbery or money. But, even if he had thought it to be true, perhaps he would not have suffered to discover in Odette's love for him that state more durable than the charm or the qualities that she could find him: the interest, the interest that would prevent the day from ever coming when she might have been tempted to stop seeing him. For the moment, by showering her with presents, by rendering her services, he could rest on advantages external to his person, to his intelligence, on the exhausting care of pleasing her by himself. And this voluptuousness of being in love, of living only on love, the reality of which he sometimes doubted, the price which, in short, he paid for it, as a dilettante, of immaterial sensations, increased its value to him – as we can see. people uncertain if the spectacle of the sea and the sound of its waves are delicious, to convince themselves of this and of the rare quality of their disinterested tastes, by renting a hundred francs a day the hotel room which allows them to taste them .","Often, she had money troubles and, hard-pressed by a debt, would ask him for help. He was happy about that, as about everything that could give Odette a strong impression of the love he had for her, or simply a strong impression of his influence, of how useful he could be to her. No doubt if someone had said to him in the beginning: “It’s your position that attracts her,” and now: “It’s because of your wealth that she loves you,” he would not have believed it, and would also not have minded very much that people imagined she was attached to him— that people felt they were joined together—by something as powerful as snobbishness or money. But, even if he had thought it was true, perhaps he would not have been hurt by discovering within Odette’s love for him that mainstay more durable than his charm or the good qualities she might find in him: namely, self-interest, a self-interest that would prevent the day ever coming when she would be tempted to stop seeing him. For the moment, by overwhelming her with presents, by doing her favors, he could rely upon advantages extrinsic to his person, his intelligence, to take over from him the exhausting responsibility of pleasing her by himself. And as for the pleasure of being in love, of living by love alone, the reality of which he doubted at times, it was increased in value for him, as dilettante of immaterial sensations, by the price he was paying her for it—as we observe that people who are uncertain whether the sight of the sea and the sound of its waves are delightful convince themselves of it and also of the exceptional quality and disinterest of their own taste, by paying a hundred francs a day for a hotel room that allows them to experience that sight and that sound.","Often she was embarrassed by lack of money, and under pressure from a creditor would come to him for assistance. He enjoyed this, as he enjoyed everything which could impress Odette with his love for herself, or merely with his influence, with the extent of the use that she might make of him. Probably if anyone had said to him, at the beginning, ""It's your position that attracts her,"" or at this stage, ""It's your money that she's really in love with,"" he would not have believed the suggestion, nor would he have been greatly distressed by the thought that people supposed her to be attached to him, that people felt them, to be united by any ties so binding as those of snobbishness or wealth. But even if he had accepted the possibility, it might not have caused him any suffering to discover that Odette's love for him was based on a foundation more lasting than mere affection, or any attractive qualities which she might have found in him; on a sound, commercial interest; an interest which would postpone for ever the fatal day on which she might be tempted to bring their relations to an end. For the moment, while he lavished presents upon her, and performed all manner of services, he could rely on advantages not contained in his person, or in his intellect, could forego the endless, killing effort to make himself attractive. And this delight in being a lover, in living by love alone, of the reality of which he was inclined to be doubtful, the price which, in the long run, he must pay for it, as a dilettante in immaterial sensations, enhanced its value in his eyes—as one sees people who are doubtful whether the sight of the sea and the sound of its waves are really enjoyable, become convinced that they are, as also of the rare quality and absolute detachment of their own taste, when they have agreed to pay several pounds a day for a room in an hotel, from which that sight and that sound may be enjoyed."

"Je m’arrangeais à tout propos à faire prononcer à mes parents le nom de Swann ; certes je me le répétais mentalement sans cesse : mais j’avais besoin aussi d’entendre sa sonorité délicieuse et de me faire jouer cette musique dont la lecture muette ne me suffisait pas. Ce nom de Swann d’ailleurs que je connaissais depuis si longtemps, était maintenant pour moi, ainsi qu’il arrive à certains aphasiques à l’égard des mots les plus usuels, un nom nouveau. Il était toujours présent à ma pensée et pourtant elle ne pouvait pas s’habituer à lui. Je le décomposais, je l’épelais, son orthographe était pour moi une surprise. Et en même temps que d’être familier, il avait cessé de me paraître innocent. Les joies que je prenais à l’entendre, je les croyais si coupables, qu’il me semblait qu’on devinait ma pensée et qu’on changeait la conversation si je cherchais à l’y amener. Je me rabattais sur les sujets qui touchaient encore à Gilberte, je rabâchais sans fin les mêmes paroles, et j’avais beau savoir que ce n’était que des paroles – des paroles prononcées loin d’elle, qu’elle n’entendait pas, des paroles sans vertu qui répétaient ce qui était, mais ne le pouvaient modifier – pourtant il me semblait qu’à force de manier, de brasser ainsi tout ce qui avoisinait Gilberte, j’en ferais peut-être sortir quelque chose d’heureux. Je redisais à mes parents que Gilberte aimait bien son institutrice, comme si cette proposition énoncée pour la centième fois allait avoir enfin pour effet de faire brusquement entrer Gilberte venant à tout jamais vivre avec nous. Je reprenais l’éloge de la vieille dame qui lisait les Débats (j’avais insinué à mes parents que c’était une ambassadrice ou peut-être une altesse) et je continuais à célébrer sa beauté, sa magnificence, sa noblesse, jusqu’au jour où je dis que d’après le nom qu’avait prononcé Gilberte, elle devait s’appeler MmeBlatin.","I contrived at all times to make my parents pronounce the name of Swann; Certainly I repeated it to myself mentally incessantly: but I also needed to hear its delicious sonority and to make me play this music whose mute reading was not enough for me. This name of Swann, moreover, which I had known for so long, was now for me, as it happens to certain aphasics with regard to the most usual words, a new name. He was always in my mind and yet she couldn't get used to him. I broke it down, I spelled it, its spelling was a surprise to me. And at the same time as being familiar, he had ceased to seem innocent to me. The joys I took in hearing it, I believed them to be so culpable, that it seemed to me that they guessed my thought and changed the conversation if I tried to bring it about. I fell back on subjects that still touched Gilberte, I kept repeating the same words endlessly, and in spite of knowing that they were only words – words spoken far from her, that she did not hear. , words without virtue which repeated what was, but could not modify it – yet it seemed to me that by dint of handling, of thus stirring up everything that surrounded Gilberte, I might perhaps bring something happy out of it. . I repeated to my parents that Gilberte really liked her teacher, as if this proposal, made for the hundredth time, was finally going to have the effect of suddenly bringing Gilberte in, coming to live with us forever. I resumed the eulogy of the old lady who read the Debates (I had insinuated to my parents that she was an ambassador or perhaps a highness) and I continued to celebrate her beauty, her magnificence, her nobility, until on the day when I said that according to the name given by Gilberte, she must have been called Madame Blatin.","I contrived at every turn to make my parents say the name Swann; of course I repeated it to myself in my own mind incessantly; but I also needed to hear the delicious sound of it and to have someone else play me this music the silent reading of which was not enough. The name Swann, which I had known for such a long time, was for me also, now, as happens for certain aphasics with the most everyday words, a new name. It was always present in my mind and yet my mind could not grow accustomed to it. I took it apart , I spelled it, its orthography was a surprise to me. And at the same time that it had ceased to be familiar, it had ceased to appear innocent. The joy I felt at hearing it I believed was so guilty that it seemed to me others guessed my thoughts and changed the conversation if I tried to lead it there. I resorted to subjects that still touched upon Gilberte, I recited the same words endlessly, and although I knew they were only words—words spoken far away from her, which she could not hear, words without potency that repeated what was, but could not modify it—yet it seemed to me that by dint of thus feeling, handling everything that touched Gilberte I would perhaps make something happy emerge from it. I told my parents again that Gilberte liked her governess very much, as if that proposition enunciated for the hundredth time were at last going to result in the sudden entrance of Gilberte, coming to live with us forever. I resumed my praise of the old lady who read Les Débats (I had hinted to my parents that she was an ambassadress or perhaps a royal highness) and I continued to celebrate her beauty, her magnificence, her nobility, until the day I said that from what I had heard Gilberte call her, her name must be Mme.","I made every effort to introduce the name of Swann into my conversation with my parents; in my own mind, of course, I never ceased to murmur it; but I needed also to hear its exquisite sound, and to make myself play that chord, the voiceless rendering of which did not suffice me. Moreover, that name of Swann, with which I had for so long been familiar, was to me now (as happens at times to people suffering from aphasia, in the case of the most ordinary words) the name of something new. It was for ever present in my mind, which could not, however, grow accustomed to it. I analysed it, I spelt it; its orthography came to me as a surprise. And with its familiarity it had simultaneously lost its innocence. The pleasure that I derived from the sound of it I felt to be so guilty, that it seemed to me as though the others must read my thoughts, and would change the conversation if I endeavoured to guide it in that direction. I fell back upon subjects which still brought me into touch with Gilberte, I eternally repeated the same words, and it was no use my knowing that they were but words—words uttered in her absence, which she could not hear, words without virtue in themselves, repeating what were, indeed, facts, but powerless to modify them—for still it seemed to me that by dint of handling, of stirring in this way everything that had reference to Gilberte , I might perhaps make emerge from it something that would bring me happiness. I told my parents again that Gilberte was very fond of her governess, as if the statement, when repeated for the hundredth time, would at last have the effect of making Gilberte suddenly burst into the room, come to live with us for ever. I had already sung the praises of the old lady who read the Débats (I had hinted to my parents that she must at least be an Ambassador's widow, if not actually a Highness) and I continued to descant on her beauty, her splendour, her nobility, until the day on which I mentioned that, by what I had heard Gilberte call her, she appeared to be a Mme."

"Le cocher revint, mais, au moment où il s’arrêta devant Swann, celui-ci ne lui dit pas : « Avez-vous trouvé cette dame ? » mais : « Faites-moi donc penser demain à commander du bois, je crois que la provision doit commencer à s’épuiser. » Peut-être se disait-il que si Rémi avait trouvé Odette dans un café où elle l’attendait, la fin de la soirée néfaste était déjà anéantie par la réalisation commencée de la fin de soirée bienheureuse et qu’il n’avait pas besoin de se presser d’atteindre un bonheur capturé et en lieu sûr, qui ne s’échapperait plus. Mais aussi c’était par force d’inertie ; il avait dans l’âme le manque de souplesse que certains êtres ont dans le corps, ceux-là qui au moment d’éviter un choc, d’éloigner une flamme de leur habit, d’accomplir un mouvement urgent, prennent leur temps, commencent par rester une seconde dans la situation où ils étaient auparavant comme pour y trouver leur point d’appui, leur élan. Et sans doute si le cocher l’avait interrompu en lui disant : « Cette dame est là », il eut répondu : « Ah ! oui, c’est vrai, la course que je vous avais donnée, tiens je n’aurais pas cru », et aurait continué à lui parler provision de bois pour lui cacher l’émotion qu’il avait eue et se laisser à lui-même le temps de rompre avec l’inquiétude et de se donner au bonheur.","The coachman came back, but when he stopped in front of Swann, the latter did not say to him: ""Have you found this lady?"" but: ""Make me think about ordering some wood tomorrow, I think the supply must be running out."" Perhaps he said to himself that if Rémi had found Odette in a café where she was waiting for him, the end of the harmful evening had already been annihilated by the realization that he had begun to realize the happy end of the evening and that he had not need to hurry to reach a happiness captured and in a safe place, which would not escape any more. But it was also by force of inertia; he had in his soul the lack of suppleness that certain beings have in their bodies, those who when it is time to avoid a shock, to move a flame away from their clothes, to accomplish an urgent movement, take their time, start by staying for a second in the situation they were in before as if to find their point of support, their momentum. And no doubt if the coachman had interrupted him by saying: “That lady is there”, he would have replied: “Ah! yes, it's true, the race I had given you, well, I wouldn't have believed it"", and would have continued to talk to him about a supply of wood to hide from him the emotion he had had and leave himself to himself. even the time to break with anxiety and give oneself to happiness.","The coachman came back, but at the moment he stopped in front of Swann, Swann did not say to him: “Did you find the lady?” but: “Remind me, tomorrow, to order more wood; I think our supply must be almost exhausted.” Perhaps he had told himself that if Rémi had found Odette in some café where she was waiting for him, the end of the ill-fated evening would already be canceled out by the fulfillment, which was just beginning, of the blissful end of the evening and that he did not need to rush to seize a happiness that was already captured and held in a safe place, that would not be able to break free. But it was also from the force of inertia; there was in his soul that lack of suppleness which can be seen in the bodies of certain people who, at the moment when they need to avoid a collision, to snatch a flame away from their clothing, to perform some other urgent motion, instead take their time, begin by remaining for a second in their original position, as though to find in it their springboard, their source of momentum. And no doubt, if the coachman had interrupted him by saying: “The lady is there,” he would have answered: “Oh yes, of course, the errand I sent you on! Well, well! Is that so?” and would have gone on talking to him about supplies of wood in order to hide the emotion he felt and allow himself time to separate from his uneasiness and give himself up to his happiness.","The coachman returned; but, as he drew up opposite him, Swann asked, not ""Did you find the lady?"" but ""Remind me, to-morrow, to order in some more firewood. I am sure we must be running short."" Perhaps he had persuaded himself that, if Rémi had at last found Odette in some café, where she was waiting for him still, then his night of misery was already obliterated by the realisation, begun already in his mind, of a night of joy, and that there was no need for him to hasten towards the attainment of a happiness already captured and held in a safe place, which would not escape his grasp again. But it was also by the force of inertia; there was in his soul that want of adaptability which can be seen in the bodies of certain people who, when the moment comes to avoid a collision, to snatch their clothes out of reach of a flame, or to perform any other such necessary movement, take their time ( as the saying is), begin by remaining for a moment in their original position, as though seeking to find in it a starting-point, a source of strength and motion. And probably, if the coachman had interrupted him with, ""I have found the lady,"" he would have answered, ""Oh, yes, of course; that's what I told you to do. I had quite forgotten,"" and would have continued to discuss his supply of firewood, so as to hide from his servant the emotion that he had felt, and to give himself time to break away from the thraldom of his anxieties and abandon himself to pleasure."

"On reconnaissait le clocher de Saint-Hilaire de bien loin, inscrivant sa figure inoubliable à l’horizon où Combray n’apparaissait pas encore ; quand du train qui, la semaine de Pâques, nous amenait de Paris, mon père l’apercevait qui filait tour à tour sur tous les sillons du ciel, faisant courir en tous sens son petit coq de fer, il nous disait : « Allons, prenez les couvertures, on est arrivé. » Et dans une des plus grandes promenades que nous faisions de Combray, il y avait un endroit où la route resserrée débouchait tout à coup sur un immense plateau fermé à l’horizon par des forêts déchiquetées que dépassait seul la fine pointe du clocher de Saint-Hilaire, mais si mince, si rose, qu’elle semblait seulement rayée sur le ciel par un ongle qui aurait voulu donner à ce paysage, à ce tableau rien que de nature, cette petite marque d’art, cette unique indication humaine. Quand on se rapprochait et qu’on pouvait apercevoir le reste de la tour carrée et à demi détruite qui, moins haute, subsistait à côté de lui, on était frappé surtout du ton rougeâtre et sombre des pierres ; et, par un matin brumeux d’automne, on aurait dit, s’élevant au-dessus du violet orageux des vignobles, une ruine de pourpre presque de la couleur de la vigne vierge.","You could recognize the steeple of Saint-Hilaire from afar, inscribing its unforgettable figure on the horizon where Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train which, during Easter week, brought us from Paris, my father saw him spinning in turn over all the furrows of the sky, making his little iron cock run in all directions, he said to us: ""Come on, take the covers, we've arrived.

When one approached and one could see the rest of the square and half-destroyed tower which, less tall, remained beside it, one was struck above all by the reddish and dark tone of the stones; and on a misty autumn morning there seemed to rise above the stormy purple of the vineyards a ruin of purple almost the color of Virginia creeper.","One could recognize the steeple of Saint-Hilaire from quite far off inscribing its unforgettable form on the horizon where Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train which, in Easter week, was bringing us from Paris, my father caught sight of it slipping by turns over all the furrows of the sky and sending its little iron weathercock running in all directions, he would say to us: “Come, gather up the rugs, we’re here.” And on one of the longest walks we took from Combray, there was a spot where the narrow road emerged suddenly on an immense plateau closed at the horizon by jagged forests above which rose only the delicate tip of the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, but so thin, so pink, that it seemed merely scratched on the sky by a fingernail which wanted to give this landscape, this exclusively natural picture, that little mark of art, that indication of human presence. When one drew near and could see the remains of the half-destroyed square tower which, not as high, still stood next to it, one was struck most of all by the dark, reddish shade of the stones; and on a misty morning in autumn one might have thought it, rising above the stormy violet of the vineyards, a ruin of purple nearly the color of a wild vine.","From a long way off one could distinguish and identify the steeple of Saint-Hilaire inscribing its unforgettable form upon a horizon beneath which Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train which brought us down from Paris at Easter-time my father caught sight of it, as it slipped into every fold of the sky in turn, its little iron cock veering continually in all directions, he would say: ""Come, get your wraps together, we are there."" And on one of the longest walks we ever took from Combray there was a spot where the narrow road emerged suddenly on to an immense plain, closed at the horizon by strips of forest over which rose and stood alone the fine point of Saint-Hilaire's steeple, but so sharpened and so pink that it seemed to be no more than sketched on the sky by the finger-nail of a painter anxious to give to such a landscape, to so pure a piece of 'nature,' this little sign of art, this single indication of human existence. As one drew near it and could make out the remains of the square tower, half in ruins, which still stood by its side, though without rivalling it in height, one was struck, first of all, by the tone, reddish and sombre, of its stones; and on a misty morning in autumn one would have called it, to see it rising above the violet thunder-cloud of the vineyards, a ruin of purple, almost the colour of the wild vine."

"Ainsi Françoise et ma tante appréciaient-elles ensemble au cours de cette séance matinale, les premiers événements du jour. Mais quelquefois ces événements revêtaient un caractère si mystérieux et si grave que ma tante sentait qu’elle ne pourrait pas attendre le moment où Françoise monterait, et quatre coups de sonnette formidables retentissaient dans la maison.","So Françoise and my aunt enjoyed together during this morning session, the first events of the day. But sometimes these events took on such a mysterious and serious character that my aunt felt she could not wait for the moment when Françoise would come upstairs, and four formidable bells rang through the house.","In this way Françoise and my aunt together appraised, during that morning session, the first events of the day. But sometimes those events assumed a character so mysterious and so grave that my aunt felt she could not wait for the moment when Françoise would come up, and four astounding peals of the bell would echo through the house.","In this way Françoise and my aunt made a critical valuation between them, in the course of these morning sessions, of the earliest happenings of the day.

"Alors vous êtes restés là comme cela tous les deux tous seuls ? Je vois d’ici cette scène. Vous êtes gentil, mon petit Mémé, je vous aime bien. » Swann se sentait soulagé. Pour lui, à qui il était arrivé en causant avec des indifférents qu’il écoutait à peine, d’entendre quelquefois certaines phrases (celle-ci par exemple : « J’ai vu hier Mme de Crécy, elle était avec un monsieur que je ne connais pas »), phrases qui aussitôt dans le cœur de Swann passaient à l’état solide, s’y durcissaient comme une incrustation, le déchiraient, n’en bougeaient plus, qu’ils étaient doux au contraire ces mots : « Elle ne connaissait personne, elle n’a parlé à personne ! » comme ils circulaient aisément en lui, qu’ils étaient fluides, faciles, respirables ! Et pourtant au bout d’un instant il se disait qu’Odette devait le trouver bien ennuyeux pour que ce fussent là les plaisirs qu’elle préférait à sa compagnie. Et leur insignifiance, si elle le rassurait, lui faisait pourtant de la peine comme une trahison.","So you two stayed there like that, all alone? I see this scene from here. You are nice, my little Granny, I like you. Swann felt relieved. For him, whom he had happened to while chatting with indifferent people whom he hardly listened to, to sometimes hear certain phrases (this one for example: ""I saw Madame de Crécy yesterday, she was with a gentleman whom I don't know""), phrases which immediately passed into a solid state in Swann's heart, hardened there like an encrustation, tore it apart, no longer moving, how sweet these words were, on the contrary: ""She didn't know anyone, she didn't speak to anyone! how easily they circulated in him, how fluid, easy, breathable they were! And yet after a moment he said to himself that Odette must find him very boring for these to be the pleasures she preferred to his company. And their insignificance, if it reassured him, nevertheless pained him like a betrayal.","So you stayed there like that just the two of you all by yourselves? I can just picture it. You are kind, my dear Mémé, I’m very fond of you.” Swann felt relieved. For him, to whom it had occasionally happened, when chatting casually with people to whom he was barely listening, that he sometimes heard certain remarks (as, for example: “I saw Mme. de Crécy yesterday; she was with a gentleman I don’t know”), remarks which, as soon as they entered Swann’s heart, solidified, hardened like an encrustation, cut into him, never moved from there again, how sweet by contrast were these words: “She knew no one, she spoke to no one,” how they circulated comfortably in him, how fluid they were, easy, breathable! And yet after a moment he would say to himself that Odette must find him quite tiresome if these were the pleasures she preferred to his company. And their insignificance, though it reassured him, nevertheless pained him like a betrayal.","Then you sat there like that, just you and she, all by yourselves? I can picture you, sitting there! You are a worthy fellow, my dear Mémé; I'm exceedingly fond of you."" Swann was now quite at ease. To him, who had so often happened, when talking to friends who knew nothing of his love, friends to whom he hardly listened, to hear certain detached sentences (as, for instance, ""I saw Mme. de Crécy yesterday; she was with a man I didn't know.""), sentences which dropped into his heart and passed at once into a solid state, grew hard as stalagmites, and seared and tore him as they lay there irremovable,—how charming, by way of contrast, were the words: ""She didn't know a soul; she never spoke to a soul. "" How freely they coursed through him, how fluid they were, how vaporous, how easy to breathe! And yet, a moment later, he was telling himself that Odette must find him very dull if those were the pleasures that she preferred to his company. And their very insignificance, though it reassured him, pained him as if her enjoyment of them had been an act of treachery."
"– Ah ! vous arrivez tard, dit MmeVerdurin à un fidèle qu’elle n’avait invité qu’en « cure-dents », nous avons eu « un » Brichot incomparable, d’une éloquence ! Mais il est parti.

"Mais le désir de connaître la vérité était plus fort et lui sembla plus noble. Il savait que la réalité de circonstances, qu’il eût donné sa vie pour restituer exactement, était lisible derrière cette fenêtre striée de lumière, comme sous la couverture enluminée d’or d’un de ces manuscrits précieux à la richesse artistique elle-même desquels le savant qui les consulte ne peut rester indifférent. Il éprouvait une volupté à connaître la vérité qui le passionnait dans cet exemplaire unique, éphémère et précieux, d’une matière translucide, si chaude et si belle.

"Certains jours pourtant, mais rares, elle venait chez lui dans l’après-midi, interrompre sa rêverie ou cette étude sur Ver Meer à laquelle il s’était remis dernièrement. On venait lui dire que Mme de Crécy était dans son petit salon. Il allait l’y retrouver, et quand il ouvrait la porte, au visage rosé d’Odette, dès qu’elle avait aperçu Swann, venait – changeant la forme de sa bouche, le regard de ses yeux, le modelé de ses joues – se mélanger un sourire. Une fois seul, il revoyait ce sourire, celui qu’elle avait eu la veille, un autre dont elle l’avait accueilli telle ou telle fois, celui qui avait été sa réponse, en voiture, quand il lui avait demandé s’il lui était désagréable en redressant les catleyas ; et la vie d’Odette pendant le reste du temps, comme il n’en connaissait rien, lui apparaissait avec son fond neutre et sans couleur, semblable à ces feuilles d’études de Watteau, où on voit çà et là, à toutes les places, dans tous les sens, dessinés aux trois crayons sur le papier chamois, d’innombrables sourires.","On certain days, however, but rare, she came to his house in the afternoon, to interrupt his reverie or this study on Ver Meer to which he had recently resumed. They had come to tell him that Madame de Crécy was in her little drawing-room. He was going to find her there, and when he opened the door, to Odette's rosy face, as soon as she had seen Swann, came - changing the shape of her mouth, the look of her eyes, the shape of her cheeks - mingle a smile. Once alone, he saw that smile again, the one she had had the day before, another with which she had greeted him on such and such a occasion, the one that had been her answer, in the car, when he had asked her if he would was disagreeable in straightening the cattleyas; and the life of Odette during the rest of the time, as he knew nothing of it, appeared to him with its neutral and colorless background, similar to those sheets of studies by Watteau, where one sees here and there, at all times. places, in all directions, drawn with three pencils on the buff paper, countless smiles.","On certain days, however, though they were rare, she came to his home in the afternoon, interrupting his daydreams or the study of Vermeer he had resumed lately. His servant would come to tell him that Mme. de Crécy was in his morning room. He would go off to find her there, and when he opened the door, as soon as she saw Swann, a smile would come and settle in Odette’s rosy face, changing the shape of her mouth, the look in her eyes, the modeling of her cheeks. Once he was alone, he would see that smile again, he would see the one she had given him the day before, another with which she had greeted him on a different occasion, the smile which had been her answer, in the carriage, when he had asked if it annoyed her that he was straightening her cattleyas; and Odette’s life during the rest of the time, since he knew nothing about it, appeared to him, with its neutral and colorless background, similar to those sheets of studies by Watteau35 in which one sees here and there, in every space, from every angle, drawn in three colors on buff paper, innumerable smiles.","On certain days, however, though these came seldom, she would call upon him in the afternoon, to interrupt his musings or the essay on Ver-meer to which he had latterly returned. His servant would come in to say that Mme. de Crécy was in the small drawing-room. He would go in search of her, and, when he opened the door, on Odette's blushing countenance, as soon as she caught sight of Swann, would appear—changing the curve of her lips, the look in her eyes, the moulding of her cheeks—an all-absorbing smile. Once he was left alone he would see again that smile, and her smile of the day before, another with which she had greeted him sometime else, the smile which had been her answer, in the carriage that night, when he had asked her whether she objected to his rearranging her cattleyas; and the life of Odette at all other times, since he knew nothing of it, appeared to him upon a neutral and colourless background, like those sheets of sketches by Watteau upon which one sees, here and there, in every corner and in all directions, traced in three colours upon the buff paper, innumerable smiles."

"Quelle horreur ! Ma consolation, c’est de penser aux femmes que j’ai connues, aujourd’hui qu’il n’y a plus d’élégance. Mais comment des gens qui contemplent ces horribles créatures sous leurs chapeaux couverts d’une volière ou d’un potager, pourraient-ils même sentir ce qu’il y avait de charmant à voir Mme Swann coiffée d’une simple capote mauve ou d’un petit chapeau que dépassait une seule fleur d’iris toute droite. Aurais-je même pu leur faire comprendre l’émotion que j’éprouvais par les matins d’hiver à rencontrer Mme Swann à pied, en paletot de loutre, coiffée d’un simple béret que dépassaient deux couteaux de plumes de perdrix, mais autour de laquelle la tiédeur factice de son appartement était évoquée, rien que par le bouquet de violettes qui s’écrasait à son corsage et dont le fleurissement vivant et bleu en face du ciel gris, de l’air glacé, des arbres aux branches nues, avait le même charme de ne prendre la saison et le temps que comme un cadre, et de vivre dans une atmosphère humaine, dans l’atmosphère de cette femme, qu’avaient dans les vases et les jardinières de son salon, près du feu allumé, devant le canapé de soie, les fleurs qui regardaient par la fenêtre close la neige tomber ? D’ailleurs il ne m’eût pas suffi que les toilettes fussent les mêmes qu’en ces années-là. À cause de la solidarité qu’ont entre elles les différentes parties d’un souvenir et que notre mémoire maintient équilibrées dans un assemblage où il ne nous est pas permis de rien distraire, ni refuser, j’aurais voulu pouvoir aller finir la journée chez une de ces femmes, devant une tasse de thé, dans un appartement aux murs peints de couleurs sombres, comme était encore celui de Mme Swann (l’année d’après celle où se termine la première partie de ce récit) et où luiraient les feux orangés, la rouge combustion, la flamme rose et blanche des chrysanthèmes dans le crépuscule de novembre, pendant des instants pareils à ceux où (comme on le verra plus tard) je n’avais pas su découvrir les plaisirs que je désirais. Mais maintenant, même ne me conduisant à rien, ces instants me semblaient avoir eu eux-mêmes assez de charme. Je voudrais les retrouver tels que je me les rappelais. Hélas ! il n’y avait plus que des appartements Louis XVI tout blancs, émaillés d’hortensias bleus. D’ailleurs, on ne revenait plus à Paris que très tard. Mme Swann m’eût répondu d’un château qu’elle ne rentrerait qu’en février, bien après le temps des chrysanthèmes, si je lui avais demandé de reconstituer pour moi les éléments de ce souvenir que je sentais attaché à une année lointaine, à un millésime vers lequel il ne m’était pas permis de remonter, les éléments de ce désir devenu lui-même inaccessible comme le plaisir qu’il avait jadis vainement poursuivi. Et il m’eût fallu aussi que ce fussent les mêmes femmes, celles dont la toilette m’intéressait parce que, au temps où je croyais encore, mon imagination les avait individualisées et les avait pourvues d’une légende. Hélas !","How awful ! My consolation is to think of the women I have known, today when there is no more elegance. But how could people who contemplate these horrible creatures under their hats covered with an aviary or a vegetable garden, even feel that there was charm in seeing Mrs. Swann wearing a simple mauve coat or a a little hat with a single straight iris flower sticking out. Could I even have made them understand the emotion I felt on winter mornings on meeting Madame Swann on foot, in an otter overcoat, wearing a simple beret that stuck out two which the artificial warmth of her apartment was evoked, only by the bouquet of violets that crushed her bodice and whose living blue blossoms against the gray sky, the icy air, the trees with their bare branches, had the same charm of taking the season and the weather only as a frame, and of living in a human atmosphere, in the atmosphere of this woman, that had in the vases and planters of her living room, near the lighted fire , in front of the silk sofa, the flowers that looked out the closed window at the falling snow? Besides, it would not have been enough for me if the toilets were the same as in those years. Because of the solidarity that the different parts of a memory have between them and that our memory keeps balanced in an assembly where we are not allowed to distract or refuse anything, I would have liked to be able to go and end the day at one of these women, in front of a cup of tea, in an apartment with walls painted in dark colors, like Madame Swann's still was (the year after that in which the first part of this story ends) and where the orange fires, the red combustion, the pink and white flame of chrysanthemums in the November twilight, during moments like those when (as we will see later) I had not been able to discover the pleasures I desired. But now, even leading me nowhere, those moments seemed to me to have had enough charm in themselves. I would like to find them as I remembered them. Alas! there were only white Louis XVI apartments, studded with blue hydrangeas. Besides, we didn't come back to Paris until very late. Madame Swann would have answered me from a chateau that she would not return until February, well after the time of the chrysanthemums, if I had asked her to reconstitute for me the elements of this memory which I felt attached to a distant year, to a vintage to which I was not allowed to go back, the elements of this desire itself become inaccessible like the pleasure he had once vainly pursued. And I would also have had to have had the same women, those whose clothes interested me because, when I still believed, my imagination had individualized them and provided them with a legend. Alas!","How awful! My consolation is to think about the women I once knew, now that there is no more elegance. But how could anyone contemplating these horrible creatures under their hats topped with a birdcage or a vegetable patch even perceive what was so charming about the sight of Mme. Swann in a simple mauve hood or a little hat with a single stiff, straight iris poking up from it? Could I even have made them understand the emotion I felt on winter mornings when I met Mme. Swann on foot, in a sealskin coat, wearing a simple beret with two blades of partridge feathers sticking up from it, but enveloped also by the artificial warmth of her apartment, which was conjured by nothing more than the bouquet of violets crushed at her breast whose live blue flowering against the gray sky, the icy air, the bare-branched trees, had the same charming manner of accepting the season and the weather merely as a setting, and of living in a human atmosphere, in the atmosphere of this woman, as had, in the vases and flower stands of her drawing room, close to the lit fire, before the silk sofa, the flowers that looked out through the closed window at the falling snow? But it would not have been enough for me anyway for the clothes to be the same as in those earlier times. Because of the dependence which the different parts of a recollection have on one another, parts which our memory keeps balanced in an aggregate from which we are not permitted to abstract anything, or reject anything, I would have wanted to be able to go spend the last part of the day in the home of one of these women, over a cup of tea, in an apartment with walls painted in dark colors, as Mme. Swann’s still was (in the year after the one in which the first part of this story ends) and in which the orange flares, the red combustion, the pink and white flame of the chrysanthemums would gleam in the November twilight, during moments like those in which (as we will see later) I was not able to discover the pleasures I desired. But now, even though they had led to nothing, those moments seemed to me to have had enough charm in themselves. I wanted to find them again as I remembered them. Alas, there was no longer anything but Louis XVI apartments all white and dotted with blue hydrangeas. Moreover, people no longer returned to Paris until very late. Mme. Swann would have answered me from a country house that she would not be back until February, well after the time of the chrysanthemums, had I asked her to reconstruct for me the elements of that memory which I felt belonged to a distant year, to a vintage to which I was not allowed to go back, the elements of that desire which had itself become as inaccessible as the pleasure it had once vainly pursued. And I would also have needed them to be the same women, those whose dress interested me because, at the time when I still believed, my imagination had individualized them and given them each a legend. Alas, in the avenue des Acacias—the Alley of the Myrtles—I did see a few of them again, old, now no more than terrible shadows of what they had been, wandering, desperately searching for who knows what in the Virgilian groves.","Oh, horrible! My consolation is to think of the women whom I have known, in the past, now that there is no standard left of elegance. But how can the people who watch these dreadful creatures hobble by, beneath hats on which have been heaped the spoils of aviary or garden-bed,—how can they imagine the charm that there was in the sight of Mme. Swann, crowned with a close-fitting lilac bonnet, or with a tiny hat from which rose stiffly above her head a single iris? "" Could I ever have made them understand the emotion that I used to feel on winter mornings, when I met Mme. Swann on foot, in an otter-skin coat, with a woollen cap from which stuck out two blade-like partridge-feathers, but enveloped also in the deliberate, artificial warmth of her own house, which was suggested by nothing more than the bunch of violets crushed into her bosom, whose flowering, vivid and blue against the grey sky, the freezing air, the naked boughs, had the same charming effect of using the season and the weather merely as a setting, and of living actually in a human atmosphere, in the atmosphere of this woman, as had in the vases and beaupots of her drawing-room, beside the blazing fire, in front of the silk-covered sofa, the flowers that looked out through closed windows at the falling snow? But it would not have sufficed me that the costumes alone should still have been the same as in those distant years. Because of the solidarity that binds together the different parts of a general impression, parts that our memory keeps in a balanced whole, of which we are not permitted to subtract or to decline any fraction, I should have liked to be able to pass the rest of the day with one of those women, over a cup of tea, in a little house with dark-painted walls (as Mme. Swann's were still in the year after that in which the first part of this story ends) against which would glow the orange flame, the red combustion, the pink and white flickering of her chrysanthemums in the twilight of a November evening, in moments similar to those in which (as we shall see) I had not managed to discover the pleasures for which I longed. But now, albeit they had led to nothing, those moments struck me as having been charming enough in themselves. I sought to find them again as I remembered them. Alas! there was nothing now but flats decorated in the Louis XVI style, all white paint, with hortensias in blue enamel. Moreover, people did not return to Paris, now, until much later. Mme. Swann would have written to me, from a country house, that she would not be in town before February, had I asked her to reconstruct for me the elements of that memory which I felt to belong to a distant era, to a date in time towards which it was forbidden me to ascend again the fatal slope, the elements of that longing which had become, itself, as inaccessible as the pleasure that it had once vainly pursued. And I should have required also that they be the same women, those whose costume interested me because, at a time when I still had faith, my imagination had individualised them and had provided each of them with a legend. Alas!"
"Et c’est à ce moment-là encore – grâce à un paysan qui passait, l’air déjà d’être d’assez mauvaise humeur, qui le fut davantage quand il faillit recevoir mon parapluie dans la figure, et qui répondit sans chaleur à mes « beau temps, n’est-ce pas, il fait bon marcher » – que j’appris que les mêmes émotions ne se produisent pas simultanément, dans un ordre préétabli, chez tous les hommes. Plus tard, chaque fois qu’une lecture un peu longue m’avait mis en humeur de causer, le camarade à qui je brûlais d’adresser la parole venait justement de se livrer au plaisir de la conversation et désirait maintenant qu’on le laissât lire tranquille. Si je venais de penser à mes parents avec tendresse et de prendre les décisions les plus sages et les plus propres à leur faire plaisir, ils avaient employé le même temps à apprendre une peccadille que j’avais oubliée et qu’ils me reprochaient sévèrement au moment où je m’élançais vers eux pour les embrasser.","And it was then again – thanks to a peasant passing by, who already seemed to be in a rather bad mood, who was even more so when he almost got my umbrella in the face, and who replied without warmth. in my “good weather, isn't it, it's good to walk” – that I learned that the same emotions do not occur simultaneously, in a pre-established order, in all men. Later, each time that a rather long reading had put me in the mood to talk, the comrade to whom I burned to speak had just indulged in the pleasure of conversation and now wanted to be left alone. read quietly. If I had just thought of my parents with tenderness and made the wisest and most appropriate decisions to please them, they had spent the same time learning a peccadillo which I had forgotten and for which they reproached me severely at the moment when I rushed towards them to kiss them.","And it was at that moment, too—because of a countryman who was passing by, who seemed rather cross already and was more so when my umbrella nearly went in his face, and who responded without warmth to my “fine weather, isn’t it, perfect for a walk”—that I learned that the same emotions do not arise simultaneously, in a preestablished order, in all men. Later, each time a rather prolonged session of reading had put me in a mood to chat, the friend I was so eager to talk to would himself have just been indulging in the pleasure of conversation and now wanted to be left to read in peace. If I had just been thinking tenderly about my parents and making the wisest decisions, those most likely to please them, they would have been employing the same time in discovering some peccadillo I had forgotten, and they would reproach me severely for it just at the moment I bounded toward them to give them a hug.","And it was at that moment, too—thanks to a peasant who went past, apparently in a bad enough humour already, but more so when he nearly received my umbrella in his face, and who replied without any cordiality to my ""Fine day, what! good to be out walking!""—that I learned that identical emotions do not spring up in the hearts of all men simultaneously, by a pre-established order. Later on I discovered that, whenever I had read for too long and was in a mood for conversation, the friend to whom I would be burning to say something would at that moment have finished indulging himself in the delights of conversation, and wanted nothing now but to be left to read undisturbed. And if I had been thinking with affection of my parents, and forming the most sensible and proper plans for giving them pleasure, they would have been using the same interval of time to discover some misdeed that I had already forgotten, and would begin to scold me severely, just as I flung myself upon them with a kiss."

"« Léonie, dit mon grand-père en rentrant, j’aurais voulu t’avoir avec nous tantôt. Tu ne reconnaîtrais pas Tansonville. Si j’avais osé, je t’aurais coupé une branche de ces épines roses que tu aimais tant. » Mon grand-père racontait ainsi notre promenade à ma tante Léonie, soit pour la distraire, soit qu’on n’eût pas perdu tout espoir d’arriver à la faire sortir. Or elle aimait beaucoup autrefois cette propriété, et d’ailleurs les visites de Swann avaient été les dernières qu’elle avait reçues, alors qu’elle fermait déjà sa porte à tout le monde. Et de même que, quand il venait maintenant prendre de ses nouvelles (elle était la seule personne de chez nous qu’il demandât encore à voir), elle lui faisait répondre qu’elle était fatiguée, mais qu’elle le laisserait entrer la prochaine fois, de même elle dit ce soir-là : « Oui, un jour qu’il fera beau, j’irai en voiture jusqu’à la porte du parc. » C’est sincèrement qu’elle le disait. Elle eût aimé revoir Swann et Tansonville ; mais le désir qu’elle en avait suffisait à ce qui lui restait de forces ; sa réalisation les eût excédées. Quelquefois le beau temps lui rendait un peu de vigueur, elle se levait, s’habillait ; la fatigue commençait avant qu’elle fût passée dans l’autre chambre et elle réclamait son lit. Ce qui avait commencé pour elle – plus tôt seulement que cela n’arrive d’habitude – c’est ce grand renoncement de la vieillesse qui se prépare à la mort, s’enveloppe dans sa chrysalide, et qu’on peut observer, à la fin des vies qui se prolongent tard, même entre les anciens amants qui se sont le plus aimés, entre les amis unis par les liens les plus spirituels, et qui, à partir d’une certaine année cessent de faire le voyage ou la sortie nécessaire pour se voir, cessent de s’écrire et savent qu’ils ne communiqueront plus en ce monde. Ma tante devait parfaitement savoir qu’elle ne reverrait pas Swann, qu’elle ne quitterait plus jamais la maison, mais cette réclusion définitive devait lui être rendue assez aisée pour la raison même qui, selon nous, aurait dû la lui rendre plus douloureuse : c’est que cette réclusion lui était imposée par la diminution qu’elle pouvait constater chaque jour dans ses forces, et qui, en faisant de chaque action, de chaque mouvement, une fatigue, sinon une souffrance, donnait pour elle à l’inaction, à l’isolement, au silence, la douceur réparatrice et bénie du repos.","""Leonie,"" said my grandfather on his way home, ""I would have liked to have you with us earlier. You wouldn't recognize Tansonville. If I had dared, I would have cut you a branch of those pink thorns that you loved so much. My grandfather used to tell my aunt Léonie about our walk, either to amuse her, or so that we would not have lost all hope of getting her out. Now she used to be very fond of this property, and moreover Swann's visits had been the last she had received, when she was already closing her door to everyone. And just as, when he came now to check on her (she was the only person in our house whom he still asked to see), she answered him that she was tired, but that she would let him in the next day. time, she also said that evening: ""Yes, one day when the weather will be nice, I'll go by car to the gate of the park. She said it sincerely. She would have liked to see Swann and Tansonville again; but her desire for it sufficed with what strength remained to her; its realization would have exceeded them. Sometimes the good weather restored her a little vigor, she got up, dressed; fatigue was beginning before she had passed into the other room and she was asking for her bed. What had begun for her - only earlier than it usually happens - is this great renunciation of old age which prepares for death, wraps itself in its chrysalis, and which can be observed, the end of lives that extend late, even between the former lovers who loved each other the most, between friends united by the most spiritual ties, and who, from a certain year onwards, stop making the trip or the outing necessary to see each other, stop writing to each other and know that they will no longer communicate in this world. My aunt must have known perfectly well that she would never see Swann again, that she would never leave the house again, but this final confinement had to be made quite easy for her for the very reason which, in our opinion, should have made it more painful for her: it is because this seclusion was imposed on her by the decrease which she could observe each day in her forces, and which, by making each action, each movement, a fatigue, if not a suffering, gave for her to inaction , to isolation, to silence, to the restorative and blessed sweetness of rest.","“Léonie,” said my grandfather when we returned, “I wish we had had you with us this afternoon. You would not recognize Tansonville. If I had dared, I would have cut you a branch of those pink hawthorns you used to love so much.” And so my grandfather told Aunt Léonie the story of our walk, either to entertain her or because they had not lost all hope of inducing her to go outdoors. For at one time she had liked that estate very much, and, too , Swann’s visits had been the last she had received, when she had already closed her door to everyone else. And just as, when he now called to inquire after her (she was the only person in our house he still asked to see), she would tell them to answer him that she was tired, but that she would let him come in the next time, so she said, that evening: “Yes, someday when it’s nice out, I’ll take the carriage and go as far as the gate of the park.” She said it sincerely. She would have liked to see Swann and Tansonville again; but this desire was enough for what strength remained to her; its fulfillment would have exceeded her strength. Sometimes the good weather restored a little of her energy, she would get up, get dressed; the fatigue would set in before she had gone into the other room and she would ask to go back to bed. What had begun for her—earlier, merely, than it usually happens—was the great renunciation which comes with old age as it prepares for death, wraps itself in its chrysalis, and which may be observed at the ends of lives that are at all extended, even in old lovers who have loved each other the most, even between friends bound by the closest ties of mutual sympathy, who, after a certain year, stop making the necessary journey or outing to see each other, stop writing to each other and know they will not communicate again in this world. My aunt must have known perfectly well that she would not see Swann again, that she would never again leave the house, but this final seclusion must have been made fairly comfortable to her for the very reason that, in our eyes, ought to have made it more painful for her: it was that this seclusion was required of her by the diminution in her strength which she could observe each day and which, making each action, each movement, a cause of fatigue, if not pain, in her eyes gave inaction, isolation, silence, the restorative and blessed sweetness of repose.","""Léonie,"" said my grandfather on our return, ""I wish we had had you with us this afternoon. You would never have known Tansonville. If I had had the courage I would have cut you a branch of that pink hawthorn you used to like so much."" And so my grandfather told her the story of our walk, either just to amuse her, or perhaps because there was still some hope that she might be stimulated to rise from her bed and to go out of doors. For in earlier days she had been very fond of Tansonville, and, moreover, Swann's visits had been the last that she had continued to receive, at a time when she had already closed her doors to all the world. And just as, when he called, in these later days, to inquire for her (and she was still the only person in our household whom he would ask to see), she would send down to say that she was tired at the moment and resting, but that she would be happy to see him another time, so, this evening, she said to my grandfather, ""Yes, some day when the weather is fine I shall go for a drive as far as the gate of the park."" And in saying this she was quite sincere. She would have liked to see Swann and Tansonville again; but the mere wish to do so sufficed for all that remained of her strength, which its fulfilment would have more than exhausted. Sometimes a spell of fine weather made her a little more energetic, she would rise and put on her clothes; but before she had reached the outer room she would be 'tired' again, and would insist on returning to her bed. The process which had begun in her—and in her a little earlier only than it must come to all of us—was the great and general renunciation which old age makes in preparation for death, the chrysalis stage of life, which may be observed wherever life has been unduly prolonged; even in old lovers who have lived for one another with the utmost intensity of passion, and in old friends bound by the closest ties of mental sympathy, who, after a certain year, cease to make, the necessary journey, or even to cross the street to see one another, cease to correspond, and know well that they will communicate no more in this world. My aunt must have been perfectly well aware that she would not see Swann again, that she would never leave her own house any more, but this ultimate seclusion seemed to be accepted by her with all the more readiness for the very reason which, to our minds, ought to have made it more unbearable; namely, that such a seclusion was forced upon her by the gradual and steady diminution in her strength which she was able to measure daily, which, by making every action, every movement 'tiring' to her if not actually painful, gave to inaction, isolation and silence the blessed, strengthening and refreshing charm of repose."

"Le départ de Mlle Swann qui – en m’ôtant la chance terrible de la voir apparaître dans une allée, d’être connu et méprisé par la petite fille privilégiée qui avait Bergotte pour ami et allait avec lui visiter des cathédrales – me rendait la contemplation de Tansonville indifférente la première fois où elle m’était permise, semblait au contraire ajouter à cette propriété, aux yeux de mon grand-père et de mon père, des commodités, un agrément passager, et, comme fait, pour une excursion en pays de montagnes, l’absence de tout nuage, rendre cette journée exceptionnellement propice à une promenade de ce côté ; j’aurais voulu que leurs calculs fussent déjoués, qu’un miracle fît apparaître Mlle Swann avec son père, si près de nous que nous n’aurions pas le temps de l’éviter et serions obligés de faire sa connaissance. Aussi, quand tout d’un coup, j’aperçus sur l’herbe, comme un signe de sa présence possible, un koufin oublié à côté d’une ligne dont le bouchon flottait sur l’eau, je m’empressai de détourner d’un autre côté les regards de mon père et de mon grand-père. D’ailleurs Swann nous ayant dit que c’était mal à lui de s’absenter, car il avait pour le moment de la famille à demeure, la ligne pouvait appartenir à quelque invité. On n’entendait aucun bruit de pas dans les allées. Divisant la hauteur d’un arbre incertain, un invisible oiseau s’ingéniait à faire trouver la journée courte, explorait d’une note prolongée la solitude environnante, mais il recevait d’elle une réplique si unanime, un choc en retour si redoublé de silence et d’immobilité qu’on aurait dit qu’il venait d’arrêter pour toujours l’instant qu’il avait cherché à faire passer plus vite. La lumière tombait si implacable du ciel devenu fixe que l’on aurait voulu se soustraire à son attention, et l’eau dormante elle-même, dont des insectes irritaient perpétuellement le sommeil, rêvant sans doute de quelque Maelstrôm imaginaire, augmentait le trouble où m’avait jeté la vue du flotteur de liège en semblant l’entraîner à toute vitesse sur les étendues silencieuses du ciel reflété ; presque vertical il paraissait prêt à plonger et déjà je me demandais, si, sans tenir compte du désir et de la crainte que j’avais de la connaître, je n’avais pas le devoir de faire prévenir Mlle Swann que le poisson mordait – quand il me fallut rejoindre en courant mon père et mon grand-père qui m’appelaient, étonnés que je ne les eusse pas suivis dans le petit chemin qui monte vers les champs et où ils s’étaient engagés. Je le trouvai tout bourdonnant de l’odeur des aubépines. La haie formait comme une suite de chapelles qui disparaissaient sous la jonchée de leurs fleurs amoncelées en reposoir ; au-dessous d’elles, le soleil posait à terre un quadrillage de clarté, comme s’il venait de traverser une verrière ; leur parfum s’étendait aussi onctueux, aussi délimité en sa forme que si j’eusse été devant l’autel de la Vierge, et les fleurs, aussi parées, tenaient chacune d’un air distrait son étincelant bouquet d’étamines, fines et rayonnantes nervures de style flamboyant comme celles qui à l’église ajouraient la rampe du jubé ou les meneaux du vitrail et qui s’épanouissaient en blanche chair de fleur de fraisier. Combien naïves et paysannes en comparaison sembleraient les églantines qui, dans quelques semaines, monteraient elles aussi en plein soleil le même chemin rustique, en la soie unie de leur corsage rougissant qu’un souffle défait.","Mlle. de Tansonville, indifferent the first time it was allowed to me, seemed on the contrary to add to this property, in the eyes of my grandfather and my father, conveniences, a temporary pleasure, and, as a matter of fact, for an excursion in the country. of mountains, the absence of any cloud, making this day exceptionally suitable for a walk on this side; I would have liked their calculations to have been foiled, for a miracle to have made Mademoiselle Swann appear with her father, so close to us that we would not have time to avoid her and would have to make her acquaintance. Also, when all of a sudden, I saw on the grass, as a sign of its possible presence, a koufin forgotten next to a line whose cork was floating on the water, I hastened to divert my attention. another side the eyes of my father and my grandfather. Besides, Swann having told us that it was wrong of him to be absent, because for the moment he had family living, the line could belong to some guest. No footsteps could be heard in the aisles. Dividing the height of an uncertain tree, an invisible bird contrived to make the day seem short, explored the surrounding solitude with a prolonged note, but he received from her such a unanimous reply, a return shock so redoubled by silence and immobility that one would have said he had just stopped forever the moment he had tried to make pass more quickly. The light fell so implacably from the sky that had become fixed that one would have liked to escape its attention, and the still water itself, whose insects perpetually irritated sleep, doubtless dreaming of some imaginary Maelstrom, increased the disorder where the sight of the cork float had thrown me, seeming to drag it at full speed over the silent expanses of the reflected sky; almost vertical it seemed ready to dive and already I was wondering if, without taking into account the desire and the fear that I had to know her, it was not my duty to inform Miss Swann that the fish was biting – when I had to run to join my father and my grandfather who were calling me, surprised that I hadn't followed them on the little path that climbs towards the fields and where they had turned. I found it all buzzing with the smell of hawthorns. The hedge formed a sort of series of chapels which disappeared under the scattering of their flowers heaped up in repositories; below them, the sun laid a grid of light on the ground, as if it had just passed through a glass roof; their perfume extended as unctuous, as delimited in its form as if I had been before the altar of the Virgin, and the flowers, so adorned, each held with a distracted air its sparkling bouquet of stamens, fine and radiating ribs of flamboyant style like those which in the church openwork the railing of the rood screen or the mullions of the stained glass window and which bloom in the white flesh of strawberry flowers. How naive and peasant in comparison would seem the wild roses who, in a few weeks, would also be climbing the same rustic path in full sun, in the plain silk of their bodices blushing like a undone breath.","Mlle. Swann’s departure, which—by taking from me the terrible chance that I might see her appear on a path, that I might be recognized and scorned by the privileged little girl who had Bergotte for a friend and went to visit cathedrals with him—made the contemplation of Tansonville a matter of indifference to me the first time it was allowed me, seemed on the contrary to add to that estate, in the eyes of my grandfather and my father, certain accommodations, a transitory charm, and, as does for an excursion into mountain country the absence of any cloud, to make that day exceptionally favorable for a walk in that direction; I would have liked their calculations to be foiled, a miracle to make Mlle. Swann appear with her father, so close to us that we would not have time to avoid her and would be obliged to make her acquaintance. And so, when suddenly I saw on the grass, like a sign of her possible presence, a creel sitting forgotten next to a line whose bob was floating on the water, I hastened to turn my father’s and grandfather’s eyes away in another direction. In any case, since Swann had told us it was bad of him to go off because he had family at the house just now , the line could belong to one of his guests. We heard no sound of steps on the avenues. Dividing the height of an unknown tree, an invisible bird, contriving to make the day seem short, explored the surrounding solitude with one prolonged note, but received from it a retort so unanimous, a repercussion so redoubled by silence and immobility, that one felt it had arrested forever that moment which it had been trying to make pass more quickly. The light fell so implacably from the still sky that one would have wanted to elude its attention, and the dormant water itself, whose sleep was perpetually irritated by insects, dreaming no doubt of some imaginary maelstrom, increased the disturbance into which I had been plunged by the sight of the cork float, by appearing to draw it at full speed over the silent reaches of the reflected sky; almost vertical, it seemed about to dive and I was already wondering if, quite beyond my desire to know her and my fear of knowing her, I did not have a duty to warn Mlle. Swann that the fish was biting—when I had to run to rejoin my father and grandfather, who were calling me, surprised that I had not followed them along the little lane they had already entered which leads up to the fields. I found it all humming with the smell of the hawthorns. The hedge formed a series of chapels that disappeared under the litter of their flowers, heaped into wayside altars; below them, the sun was laying down a grid of brightness on the ground as if it had just passed through a stained-glass window; their perfume spread as unctuous, as delimited in its form as if I were standing before the altar of the Virgin, and the flowers, themselves adorned also, each held out with a distracted air its sparkling bunch of stamens, delicate radiating ribs in the flamboyant style like those which, in the church, perforated the balustrade of the rood screen or the mullions of the window and blossomed out into the white flesh of a strawberry flower. How naive and folksy by comparison would seem the sweetbriers which, in a few weeks, would climb in full sun the same country lane, in the smooth silk of their blushing bodices undone by a breath.","The absence of Mlle. Swann, which—since it preserved me from the terrible risk of seeing her appear on one of the paths, and of being identified and scorned by this so privileged little girl who had Bergotte for a friend and used to go with him to visit cathedrals—made the exploration of Tansonville, now for the first time permitted me, a matter of indifference to myself, seemed however to invest the property, in my grandfather's and father's eyes, with a fresh and transient charm, and (like an entirely cloudless sky when one is going mountaineering) to make the day extraordinarily propitious for a walk in this direction; I should have liked to see their reckoning proved false, to see, by a miracle, Mlle. Swann appear, with her father, so close to us that we should not have time to escape, and should therefore be obliged to make her acquaintance. And so, when I suddenly noticed a straw basket lying forgotten on the grass by the side of a line whose float was bobbing in the water, I made a great effort to keep my father and grandfather looking in another direction, away from this sign that she might, after all, be in residence. Still, as Swann had told us that he ought not, really, to go away just then, as he had some people staying in the house, the line might equally belong to one of these guests. Not a footstep was to be heard on any of the paths. Somewhere in one of the tall trees, making a stage in its height, an invisible bird, desperately attempting to make the day seem shorter, was exploring with a long, continuous note the solitude that pressed it on every side, but it received at once so unanimous an answer, so powerful a repercussion of silence and of immobility that, one would have said, it had arrested for all eternity the moment which it had been trying to make pass more quickly. The sunlight fell so implacably from a fixed sky that one was naturally inclined to slip away out of the reach of its attentions, and even the slumbering water, whose repose was perpetually being invaded by the insects that swarmed above its surface, while it dreamed, no doubt, of some imaginary maelstrom, intensified the uneasiness which the sight of that floating cork had wrought in me, by appearing to draw it at full speed across the silent reaches of a mirrored firmament; now almost vertical, it seemed on the point of plunging down out of sight, and I had begun to ask myself whether, setting aside the longing and the terror that I had of making her acquaintance, it was not actually my duty to warn Mlle. Swann that the fish was biting—when I was obliged to run after my father and grandfather, who were calling me, and were surprised that I had not followed them along the little path, climbing up hill towards the open fields, into which they had already turned. I found the whole path throbbing with the fragrance of hawthorn-blossom. The hedge resembled a series of chapels, whose walls were no longer visible under the mountains of flowers that were heaped upon their altars; while underneath, the sun cast a square of light upon the ground, as though it had shone in upon them through a window; the scent that swept out over me from them was as rich, and as circumscribed in its range, as though I had been standing before the Lady-altar, and the flowers, themselves adorned also, held out each its little bunch of glittering stamens with an air of inattention, fine, radiating 'nerves' in the flamboyant style of architecture, like those which, in church, framed the stair to the rood-loft or closed the perpendicular tracery of the windows, but here spread out into pools of fleshy white, like strawberry-beds in spring. How simple and rustic, in comparison with these, would seem the dog-roses which, in a few weeks' time, would be climbing the same hillside path in the heat of the sun, dressed in the smooth silk of their blushing pink bodices, which would be undone and scattered by the first breath of wind."

"Formée du plaisir que j’étais sur le point de goûter, je m’imaginais que c’était elle qui me l’offrait. Mon corps qui sentait dans le sien ma propre chaleur voulait s’y rejoindre, je m’éveillais. Le reste des humains m’apparaissait comme bien lointain auprès de cette femme que j’avais quittée, il y avait quelques moments à peine ; ma joue était chaude encore de son baiser, mon corps courbaturé par le poids de sa taille. Si, comme il arrivait quelquefois, elle avait les traits d’une femme que j’avais connue dans la vie, j’allais me donner tout entier à ce but : la retrouver, comme ceux qui partent en voyage pour voir de leurs yeux une cité désirée et s’imaginent qu’on peut goûter dans une réalité le charme du songe. Peu à peu son souvenir s’évanouissait, j’avais oublié la fille de mon rêve.","Formed from the pleasure I was about to taste, I imagined that she was the one offering it to me. My body, which felt my own warmth in its own, wanted to join it, I woke up. The rest of the humans seemed to me to be very far away from this woman I had left just a few moments ago; my cheek was still warm from his kiss, my body aching from the weight of his height. If, as sometimes happened, she had the features of a woman I had known in life, I was going to give myself entirely to this goal: to find her, like those who go on a journey to see with their eyes a desired city and imagine that one can taste the charm of a dream in a reality. Little by little her memory faded, I had forgotten the girl of my dream.","Formed from the pleasure I was on the point of enjoying, she, I imagined, was the one offering it to me.

Little by little the memory of her would fade, I had forgotten the girl of my dream.","Formed by the appetite that I was on the point of gratifying, she it was, I imagined, who offered me that gratification. My body, conscious that its own warmth was permeating hers, would strive to become one with her, and I would awake. The rest of humanity seemed very remote in comparison with this woman whose company I had left but a moment ago: my cheek was still warm with her kiss, my body bent beneath the weight of hers. If, as would sometimes happen, she had the appearance of some woman whom I had known in waking hours, I would abandon myself altogether to the sole quest of her, like people who set out on a journey to see with their own eyes some city that they have always longed to visit, and imagine that they can taste in reality what has charmed their fancy. And then, gradually, the memory of her would dissolve and vanish, until I had forgotten the maiden of my dream."

"et elle se sentait pour lui une immense et soudaine amitié. Mais, en revanche ceux, qui comme Swann, avaient ces goûts, mais n’en parlaient pas, la laissaient froide. Sans doute elle était obligée d’avouer que Swann ne tenait pas à l’argent, mais elle ajoutait d’un air boudeur : « Mais lui, ça n’est pas la même chose » ; et en effet, ce qui parlait à son imagination, ce n’était pas la pratique du désintéressement, c’en était le vocabulaire.","and she felt an immense and sudden friendship for him.

"Mais le prestige qu’avait à ses yeux le Président de la République finit pourtant par triompher et de l’humilité de Swann et de la malveillance de MmeVerdurin, et à chaque dîner, Cottard demandait avec intérêt : « Verrons-nous ce soir M. Swann ? Il a des relations personnelles avec M. Grévy. C’est bien ce qu’on appelle un gentleman ? » Il alla même jusqu’à lui offrir une carte d’invitation pour l’exposition dentaire.","But the prestige that the President of the Republic had in his eyes nevertheless ended up triumphing both over Swann's humility and Madame Verdurin's malevolence, and at each dinner Cottard asked with interest: ""Shall we see M.

He even went so far as to give her an invitation card to the dental show.","But the prestige of the President of the Republic in the eyes of the doctor ended by prevailing over both Swann’s modesty and Mme.

"Plus tard, quand je fus au collège, chaque fois que pendant les classes je correspondais, aussitôt que le professeur avait la tête tournée, avec un nouvel ami, ma première question était toujours pour lui demander s’il était déjà allé au théâtre et s’il trouvait que le plus grand acteur était bien Got, le second Delaunay, etc.","Later, when I was in college, each time during the classes I corresponded, as soon as the professor had his head turned, with a new friend, my first question was always to ask him if he had already been to the theater and s he found that the greatest actor was Got, the second Delaunay, etc.","Later, when I was in school, each time I wrote to a new friend during class as soon as the teacher’s head was turned, my first question was always whether he had been to the theater yet and whether he thought the greatest actor really was Got, the second best Delaunay, etc.","And later, in my schooldays, whenever I ventured in class, when the master's head was turned, to communicate with some new friend, I would always begin by asking him whether he had begun yet to go to theatres, and if he agreed that our greatest actor was undoubtedly Got, our second Delaunay, and so on."
"Mais une fois qu’ayant songé avec maussaderie à cet inévitable retour ensemble, il avait emmené jusqu’au Bois sa jeune ouvrière pour retarder le moment d’aller chez les Verdurin, il arriva chez eux si tard, qu’Odette, croyant qu’il ne viendrait plus, était partie. En voyant qu’elle n’était plus dans le salon, Swann ressentit une souffrance au cœur ; il tremblait d’être privé d’un plaisir qu’il mesurait pour la première fois, ayant eu jusque-là cette certitude de le trouver quand il le voulait, qui pour tous les plaisirs nous diminue ou même nous empêche d’apercevoir aucunement leur grandeur.","But once, having thought sullenly of this inevitable return together, he had taken his young worker to the Bois to delay the moment of going to the Verdurins, he arrived at their house so late that Odette, believing that he would no longer come, had left.

When he saw that she was no longer in the drawing room, Swann felt a pain in his heart; he trembled at being deprived of a pleasure that he was now measuring for the first time, having had until then that certainty of finding it when he wanted it which in the case of all pleasures diminishes for us, or even prevents us from perceiving at all, their greatness.","But one evening, when, irritated by the thought of that inevitable dark drive together, he had taken his other 'little girl' all the way to the Bois, so as to delay as long as possible the moment of his appearance at the Verdurins', he was so late in reaching them that Odette, supposing that he did not intend to come, had already left. Seeing the room bare of her, Swann felt his heart wrung by sudden anguish; he shook with the sense that he was being deprived of a pleasure whose intensity he began then for the first time to estimate, having always, hitherto, had that certainty of finding it whenever he would, which (as in the case of all our pleasures) reduced, if it did not altogether blind him to its dimensions."

"Je dînai avec Legrandin sur sa terrasse ; il faisait clair de lune : « Il y a une jolie qualité de silence, n’est-ce pas, me dit-il ; aux cœurs blessés comme l’est le mien, un romancier que vous lirez plus tard prétend que conviennent seulement l’ombre et le silence. Et voyez-vous, mon enfant, il vient dans la vie une heure dont vous êtes bien loin encore où les yeux las ne tolèrent plus qu’une lumière, celle qu’une belle nuit comme celle-ci prépare et distille avec l’obscurité, où les oreilles ne peuvent plus écouter de musique que celle que joue le clair de lune sur la flûte du silence. » J’écoutais les paroles de M. Legrandin qui me paraissaient toujours si agréables ; mais troublé par le souvenir d’une femme que j’avais aperçue dernièrement pour la première fois, et pensant, maintenant que je savais que Legrandin était lié avec plusieurs personnalités aristocratiques des environs, que peut-être il connaissait celle-ci, prenant mon courage, je lui dis : « Est-ce que vous connaissez, monsieur, la… les châtelaines de Guermantes ? », heureux aussi en prononçant ce nom de prendre sur lui une sorte de pouvoir, par le seul fait de le tirer de mon rêve et de lui donner une existence objective et sonore.","I dined with Legrandin on his terrace; it was moonlit. “There’s a lovely quality to silence, isn’t there,” he said to me; to wounded hearts like mine, a novelist you will read later claims that only shadow and silence are suitable. And you see, my child, there comes in life an hour from which you are still very far when tired eyes can only tolerate one light, the one that a beautiful night like this prepares and distills with the darkness. , where the ears can hear no more music than that played by the moonlight on the flute of silence. I listened to M. Legrandin's words, which always seemed so agreeable to me; but disturbed by the memory of a woman whom I had recently seen for the first time, and thinking, now that I knew that Legrandin was connected with several aristocratic personalities in the vicinity, that perhaps he knew this one, taking my Courage, I said to him: “Do you know, sir, the… the chatelaines of Guermantes? happy also, by pronouncing this name, to take on a sort of power over it, by the mere fact of drawing it from my dream and giving it an objective and sonorous existence.","I had dinner with Legrandin on his terrace; the moon was shining: “This silence has a nice quality, does it not?” he said to me; “for wounded hearts such as mine, a novelist whom you will read later asserts that the only fit companions are shadow and silence.36 And you know, my child, in life there comes a time, still quite remote for you, when our weary eyes can tolerate only one light, that which a lovely night like this prepares and distills from the darkness, when our ears cannot listen to any other music but that which is played by the moonlight on the flute of silence.” I was listening to M. Legrandin’s words, which always seemed to me so pleasant; but disturbed by the memory of a woman I had seen recently for the first time, and thinking, now that I knew Legrandin was friends with several of the prominent local aristocracy, that perhaps he knew this one, plucking up my courage I said to him: “Monsieur, do you know the lady . . . the ladies of Guermantes?,” happy too that in pronouncing this name I was assuming a sort of power over it, by the mere fact of bringing it out of my daydreams and giving it an objective existence in the world of sound.","I dined with Legrandin on the terrace of his house, by moonlight. ""There is a charming quality, is there not,"" he said to me, ""in this silence; for hearts that are wounded, as mine is, a novelist, whom you will read in time to come, claims that there is no remedy but silence and shadow. And see you this, my boy, there comes in all lives a time, towards which you still have far to go, when the weary eyes can endure but one kind of light, the light which a fine evening like this prepares for us in the stillroom of darkness, when the ears can listen to no music save what the moonlight breathes through the flute of silence."" I could hear what M. Legrandin was saying; like everything that he said, it sounded attractive; but I was disturbed by the memory of a lady whom I had seen recently for the first time; and thinking, now that I knew that Legrandin was on friendly terms with several of the local aristocracy, that perhaps she also was among his acquaintance, I summoned up all my courage and said to him: ""Tell me, sir, do you, by any chance, know the lady—the ladies of Guermantes?"" and I felt glad because, in pronouncing the name, I had secured a sort of power over it, by the mere act of drawing it up out of my dreams and giving it an objective existence in the world of spoken things."
"Mais il ne lui fit pas remarquer cette contradiction, car il pensait que, livrée à elle-même, Odette produirait peut-être quelque mensonge qui serait un faible indice de la vérité ; elle parlait ; il ne l’interrompait pas, il recueillait avec une piété avide et douloureuse ces mots qu’elle lui disait et qu’il sentait (justement, parce qu’elle la cachait derrière eux tout en lui parlant) garder vaguement, comme le voile sacré, l’empreinte, dessiner l’incertain modelé, de cette réalité infiniment précieuse et hélas introuvable : – ce qu’elle faisait tantôt à trois heures, quand il était venu – de laquelle il ne posséderait jamais que ces mensonges, illisibles et divins vestiges, et qui n’existait plus que dans le souvenir receleur de cet être qui la contemplait sans savoir l’apprécier, mais ne la lui livrerait pas. Certes il se doutait bien par moments qu’en elles-mêmes les actions quotidiennes d’Odette n’étaient pas passionnément intéressantes, et que les relations qu’elle pouvait avoir avec d’autres hommes n’exhalaient pas naturellement d’une façon universelle et pour tout être pensant une tristesse morbide, capable de donner la fièvre du suicide. Il se rendait compte alors que cet intérêt, cette tristesse n’existaient qu’en lui comme une maladie, et que quand celle-ci serait guérie, les actes d’Odette, les baisers qu’elle aurait pu donner redeviendraient inoffensifs comme ceux de tant d’autres femmes. Mais que la curiosité douloureuse que Swann y portait maintenant n’eût sa cause qu’en lui n’était pas pour lui faire trouver déraisonnable de considérer cette curiosité comme importante et de mettre tout en œuvre pour lui donner satisfaction.","But he did not point out this contradiction to her, for he thought that, left to her own devices, Odette would perhaps produce some lie which would be a weak indication of the truth; she spoke ; he did not interrupt her, he collected with an avid and painful piety these words which she said to him and which he felt (precisely because she hid her behind them while speaking to him) vaguely guarding, like the sacred veil , the imprint, drawing the uncertain model, of this infinitely precious and unfortunately unfindable reality: - what she was doing earlier at three o'clock, when he had come - from which he would never possess anything but these lies, illegible and divine vestiges , and which no longer existed except in the concealing memory of this being who contemplated her without knowing how to appreciate her, but would not deliver her to him. Admittedly, he suspected at times that in themselves Odette's daily actions were not passionately interesting, and that the relationships she might have with other men did not naturally exude in a universal way. and for every thinking being a morbid sadness, capable of giving rise to the fever of suicide. He then realized that this interest, this sadness existed only in him like an illness, and that when it was cured, Odette's acts, the kisses she might have given would again become harmless like those of so many other women. But that the painful curiosity that Swann felt for it now had its cause only in him was not to make him find it unreasonable to consider this curiosity as important and to do everything possible to satisfy it.","But he did not point out this contradiction to her, because he thought that, left to herself, Odette would perhaps produce some lie that would be a faint indication of the truth; she would talk; he would not interrupt her, he would collect with an avid and painful piety the words she said to him, feeling (precisely because she was hiding it behind them as she talked to him) that, like the sacred veil, they retained the vague imprint, sketched the uncertain features, of that reality so infinitely precious and, alas! undiscoverable—what she had been doing that afternoon at three o’clock, when he came—of which he would never possess more than these lies, illegible and divine vestiges, and which now existed only in the memory of this woman, who would conceal it like stolen goods and contemplate it without being able to appreciate it, but would not hand it over to him. Of course, he fully suspected at times that in themselves Odette’s daily actions were not passionately interesting, and that the relationships she might have with other men did not naturally, universally, and for every intelligent creature exhale a morbid sadness capable of infecting one with a feverish desire to commit suicide. He would then realize that this interest, this sadness existed only in him like a disease, and that, once this disease was cured, Odette’s actions, the kisses she might have given would become once again as harmless as those of so many other women. But the fact that the painful curiosity which Swann brought to them now had its origin only in himself was not enough to make him think it was unreasonable to consider this curiosity important and to use every possible means to satisfy it.","He did not, however, draw her attention to this inconsistency, for he thought that, if left to herself, Odette might perhaps produce some falsehood which would give him a faint indication of the truth; she spoke; he did not interrupt her, he gathered up, with an eager and sorrowful piety, the words that fell from her lips, feeling (and rightly feeling, since she was hiding the truth behind them as she spoke) that, like the veil of a sanctuary, they kept a vague imprint, traced a faint outline of that infinitely precious and, alas, undiscoverable truth;—what she had been doing, that afternoon, at three o'clock, when he had called,—a truth of which he would never possess any more than these falsifications, illegible and divine traces, a truth which would exist henceforward only in the secretive memory of this creature, who would contemplate it in utter ignorance of its value, but would never yield it up to him. It was true that he had, now and then, a strong suspicion that Odette's daily activities were not hi themselves passionately interesting, and that such relations as she might have with other men did not exhale, naturally, in a universal sense, or for every rational being, a spirit of morbid gloom capable of infecting with fever or of inciting to suicide. He realised, at such moments, that that interest, that gloom, existed in him only as a malady might exist, and that, once he was cured of the malady, the actions of Odette, the kisses that she might have bestowed, would become once again as innocuous as those of countless other women. But the consciousness that the painful curiosity with which Swann now studied them had its origin only in himself was not enough to make him decide that it was unreasonable to regard that curiosity as important, and to take every possible step to satisfy it."

Si ce n’est une de ces œuvres étranges comme le Testament de César Girodot et Oedipe-Roi lesquelles s’inscrivaient, non sur l’affiche verte de l’Opéra-Comique, mais sur l’affiche lie de vin de la Comédie-Française, rien ne me paraissait plus différent de l’aigrette étincelante et blanche des Diamants de la Couronne que le satin lisse et mystérieux du Domino Noir, et, mes parents m’ayant dit que quand j’irais pour la première fois au théâtre j’aurais à choisir entre ces deux pièces, cherchant à approfondir successivement le titre de l’une et le titre de l’autre, puisque c’était tout ce que je connaissais d’elles, pour tâcher de saisir en chacun le plaisir qu’il me promettait et de le comparer à celui que recélait l’autre, j’arrivais à me représenter avec tant de force, d’une part une pièce éblouissante et fière, de l’autre une pièce douce et veloutée, que j’étais aussi incapable de décider laquelle aurait ma préférence, que si, pour le dessert, on m’avait donné à opter entre du riz à l’Impératrice et de la crème au chocolat.","Every morning I ran to the Moriss column to see the shows it announced. Nothing was more disinterested and happier than the dreams offered to my imagination by each piece announced, and which were conditioned both by the images inseparable from the words which made up the title and also by the color of the posters still damp and puffy. of glue on which it was coming off. If it is not one of those strange works like the Testament of César Girodot and Oedipe-Roi which were inscribed, not on the green poster of the Opéra-Comique, but on the wine-colored poster of the Comédie- French, nothing seemed to me more different from the sparkling white aigrette of the Diamants de la Couronne than the smooth and mysterious satin of the Domino Noir, and, my parents having told me that when I went to the theater for the first time I I would have to choose between these two pieces, seeking to successively deepen the title of one and the title of the other, since that was all I knew of them, in order to try to grasp in each the pleasure that it promised me and to compare it to the one concealed in the other, I managed to represent myself with such force, on the one hand a dazzling and proud piece, on the other a soft and velvety piece, that I was as unable to decide which would have my preference, as if, for dessert, I had been given the choice between rice with Empress and chocolate cream.","Every morning I would run to the Morris column7 to see what shows were being announced. Nothing was more disinterested or happier than the daydreams inspired in my imagination by each play that was announced, daydreams conditioned both by the images inseparable from the words that made up its title and also by the color of the posters, still damp and blistered with paste, against which that title stood out. Except for those strange works like Le Testament de César Girodot or Oedipe-Roi, which were inscribed, not on the green poster of the Opéra-Comique, but on the wine-red poster of the Comédie-Française, nothing seemed to me more different from the sparkling white plume of Les Diamants de la Couronne than the smooth, mysterious satin of Le Domino Noir,8 and, since my parents had told me that when I went to the theater for the first time I would have to choose between these two plays, as I tried to study exhaustively and in turn the title of one and then the title of the other, since this was all I knew of them, so as to attempt to discern the pleasure each one promised me and compare it to the pleasure that lay concealed within the other, I managed to picture to myself so forcefully, on the one hand a play that was dazzling and proud, on the other a play that was soft and velvety, that I was as incapable of deciding which I would prefer as if, for dessert, I had been given the choice between rice à l’Impératrice and chocolate custard.","Every morning I would hasten to the Moriss column to see what new plays it announced. Nothing could be more disinterested or happier than the dreams with which these announcements filled my mind, dreams which took their form from the inevitable associations of the words forming the title of the play, and also from the colour of the bills, still damp and wrinkled with paste, on which those words stood out. Nothing, unless it were such strange titles as the Testament de César Girodot, or Oedipe-Roi, inscribed not on the green bills of the Opéra-Comique, but on the wine-coloured bills of the Comédie-Française, nothing seemed to me to differ more profoundly from the sparkling white plume of the Diamants de la Couronne than the sleek, mysterious satin of the Domino Noir; and since my parents had told me that, for my first visit to the theatre, I should have to choose between these two pieces, I would study exhaustively and in turn the title of one and the title of the other (for those were all that I knew of either), attempting to snatch from each a foretaste of the pleasure which it offered me, and to compare this pleasure with that latent in the other title, until in the end I had shewn myself such vivid, such compelling pictures of, on the one hand, a play of dazzling arrogance, and on the other a gentle, velvety play, that I was as little capable of deciding which play I should prefer to see as if, at the dinner-table, they had obliged me to choose between rice à l'Impératrice and the famous cream of chocolate."
Et elle en était empoisonnée.,And she was poisoned by it.,And it was poisoned by them.,And they poisoned it.
"Comme MmeVerdurin donnait parfois à Swann ce qui seul pouvait constituer pour lui le bonheur ; comme, tel soir où il se sentait anxieux parce qu’Odette avait causé avec un invité plus qu’avec un autre, et où, irrité contre elle, il ne voulait pas prendre l’initiative de lui demander si elle reviendrait avec lui, MmeVerdurin lui apportait la paix et la joie en disant spontanément : « Odette, vous allez ramener M. Swann, n’est-ce pas » ? comme cet été qui venait et où il s’était d’abord demandé avec inquiétude si Odette ne s’absenterait pas sans lui, s’il pourrait continuer à la voir tous les jours, MmeVerdurin allait les inviter à le passer tous deux chez elle à la campagne – Swann laissant à son insu la reconnaissance et l’intérêt s’infiltrer dans son intelligence et influer sur ses idées, allait jusqu’à proclamer que MmeVerdurin était une grande âme. De quelques gens exquis ou éminents que tel de ses anciens camarades de l’école du Louvre lui parlât : « Je préfère cent fois les Verdurin », lui répondait-il. Et, avec une solennité qui était nouvelle chez lui : « Ce sont des êtres magnanimes, et la magnanimité est, au fond, la seule chose qui importe et qui distingue ici-bas. Vois-tu, il n’y a que deux classes d’êtres : les magnanimes et les autres ; et je suis arrivé à un âge où il faut prendre parti, décider une fois pour toutes qui on veut aimer et qui on veut dédaigner, se tenir à ceux qu’on aime et, pour réparer le temps qu’on a gâché avec les autres, ne plus les quitter jusqu’à sa mort. Eh bien ! ajoutait-il avec cette légère émotion qu’on éprouve quand, même sans bien s’en rendre compte, on dit une chose non parce qu’elle est vraie, mais parce qu’on a plaisir à la dire et qu’on l’écoute dans sa propre voix comme si elle venait d’ailleurs que de nous-mêmes, le sort en est jeté, j’ai choisi d’aimer les seuls cœurs magnanimes et de ne plus vivre que dans la magnanimité. Tu me demandes si MmeVerdurin est véritablement intelligente. Je t’assure qu’elle m’a donné les preuves d’une noblesse de cœur, d’une hauteur d’âme où, que veux-tu, on n’atteint pas sans une hauteur égale de pensée. Certes elle a la profonde intelligence des arts. Mais ce n’est peut-être pas là qu’elle est le plus admirable ; et telle petite action ingénieusement, exquisement bonne, qu’elle a accomplie pour moi, telle géniale attention, tel geste familièrement sublime, révèlent une compréhension plus profonde de l’existence que tous les traités de philosophie. »","As Madame Verdurin sometimes gave Swann what alone could constitute happiness for him; like, such an evening when he felt anxious because Odette had talked with one guest more than with another, and when, irritated with her, he did not want to take the initiative to ask her if she would come back with him, Mme Verdurin brought her peace and joy by saying spontaneously: ""Odette, you're going to bring Mr. Swann back, aren't you?"" like this summer which was coming and when he had first wondered with concern if Odette would not be absent without him, if he could continue to see her every day, Mme Verdurin was going to invite them both to spend it at her place. in the country – Swann, unwittingly letting gratitude and interest seep into his intelligence and influence his ideas, went so far as to proclaim that Madame Verdurin was a great soul. Of some exquisite or eminent people that one of his former comrades from the school of the Louvre spoke to him: ""I prefer the Verdurins a hundred times over"", he replied. And, with a solemnity that was new to him: ""They are magnanimous beings, and magnanimity is, at bottom, the only thing that matters and that distinguishes here below."" You see, there are only two classes of beings: the magnanimous and the others; and I've reached an age where you have to take sides, decide once and for all who you want to love and who you want to disdain, stick to those you love and, to make up for the time you've wasted with others , never to leave them again until his death. Well ! he added with that slight emotion that one feels when, even without realizing it, one says something not because it is true, but because one enjoys saying it and listen to your own voice as if it came from somewhere other than ourselves, the die is cast, I have chosen to love only magnanimous hearts and to live only in magnanimity. You ask me if Madame Verdurin is truly intelligent. I assure you that she has given me proof of a nobility of heart, of a loftiness of soul which, what do you want, one does not attain without an equal loftiness of thought. Certainly she has a deep understanding of the arts. But that may not be where she is most admirable; and such ingeniously, exquisitely good little deed she has done for me, such brilliant attention, such familiarly sublime gesture, reveal a deeper understanding of existence than all treatises of philosophy. »","Because Mme. Verdurin sometimes gave Swann the only thing that could constitute happiness for him; because, on a certain evening when he felt anxious because Odette had been talking to one guest more than another, and when, irritated at her, he did not want to take the initiative of asking her if she would return home with him, Mme. Verdurin brought him peace and joy by saying spontaneously: “Odette, you will take M. Swann home, won’t you?”; because, when summer was approaching, and he had at first wondered uneasily if Odette would be going away without him, if he could continue to see her every day, Mme. Verdurin invited them both to spend it at her home in the country—Swann, unconsciously allowing gratitude and self-interest to infiltrate into his intelligence and influence his ideas, went so far as to proclaim that Mme. Verdurin was the soul of high-mindedness. Apropos of a few delightful or eminent people whom one of his old classmates from the École du Louvre might mention to him, he would respond: “I prefer the Verdurins a hundred times over.” And, with a solemnity that was new to him: “They are magnanimous people, and magnanimity is, fundamentally, the only thing that matters and that gives us distinction here on earth. You know, there are only two classes of people: the magnanimous ones and all the rest; and when you reach my age you have to choose, you have to decide once and for all whom you intend to like and, whom you intend to despise, stick with the ones you like, and, so as to make up for the time you’ve wasted with the others, not leave them again until you die. Well!” he added with that slight emotion you feel when, even without fully realizing it, you say something not because it is true, but because you enjoy saying it and you listen to it in your own voice as if it came from somewhere other than from yourself, “my fate is settled, I have chosen to like only magnanimous hearts and to live from now on only in magnanimity. You ask me if Mme. Verdurin is truly intelligent. I assure you that she has given me proof of a nobility of heart, of a loftiness of soul which, you know, can’t be attained without an equal loftiness of mind. Certainly she has a profound intelligence where the arts are concerned. But perhaps this is not her most admirable quality; and every small, ingeniously, exquisitely good action that she has performed for me, every genial attention, every gesture of sublime familiarity, reveals a more profound understanding of life than any philosophical treatise.”","Verdurin gave Swann, now and then, what alone could constitute his happiness; since, on an evening when he felt anxious because Odette had talked rather more to one of the party than to another, and, in a spasm of irritation, would not take the initiative by asking her whether she was coming home, Mme. Verdurin brought peace and joy to his troubled spirit by the spontaneous exclamation: ""Odette! You'll see M. Swann home, won't you?""; since, when the summer holidays came, and after he had asked himself uneasily whether Odette might not leave Paris without him, whether he would still be able to see her every day, Mme. Verdurin was going to invite them both to spend the summer with her in the country; Swann, unconsciously allowing gratitude and self-interest to filter into his intelligence and to influence his ideas, went so far as to proclaim that Mme. Verdurin was ""a great and noble soul. "" Should any of his old fellow-pupils in the Louvre school of painting speak to him of some rare or eminent artist, ""I'd a hundred times rather,"" he would reply, ""have the Verdurins."" And, with a solemnity of diction which was new in him: ""They are magnanimous creatures, and magnanimity is, after all, the one thing that matters, the one thing that gives us distinction here on earth. Look you, there are only two classes of men, the magnanimous, and the rest; and I have reached an age when one has to take sides, to decide once and for all whom one is going to like and dislike, to stick to the people one likes, and, to make up for the time one has wasted with the others, never to leave them again as long as one lives. Very well!"" he went on, with the slight emotion which a man feels when, even without being fully aware of what he is doing, he says something, not because it is true but because he enjoys saying it, and listens to his own voice uttering the words as though they came from some one else, ""The die is now cast; I have elected to love none but magnanimous souls, and to live only in an atmosphere of magnanimity. You ask me whether Mme. Verdurin is really intelligent. I can assure you that she has given me proofs of a nobility of heart, of a loftiness of soul, to which no one could possibly attain— how could they?—without a corresponding loftiness of mind. Without question, she has a profound understanding of art. But it is not, perhaps, in that that she is most admirable; every little action, ingeniously, exquisitely kind, which she has performed for my sake, every friendly attention, simple little things, quite domestic and yet quite sublime, reveal a more profound comprehension of existence than all your textbooks of philosophy."" * * *"
"Ainsi elle et la Cité des lys n’étaient pas seulement des tableaux fictifs qu’on mettait à volonté devant son imagination, mais existaient à une certaine distance de Paris qu’il fallait absolument franchir si l’on voulait les voir, à une certaine place déterminée de la terre, et à aucune autre, en un mot étaient bien réelles.

They became even more so for me, when my father, by saying: “So you could stay in Venice from the twentieth of April until the twenty-ninth and arrive in Florence on Easter morning” made them both emerge no longer merely from abstract Space, but from that imaginary Time in which we situate, not one journey at a time but others simultaneously and without too much emotion since they are only possibilities—that Time which re-creates itself so effectively that we can spend it again in one town after we have spent it in another—and devoted to them some of those particular days which are the certificate of authenticity of the objects on which one employs them, for those unique days are consumed by use, they do not come back, one cannot live them here when one has lived them there; I felt that it was toward the week which began on the Monday when the washerwoman was to bring back the white waistcoat I had covered with ink that the two Queen Cities were heading, to absorb themselves in it as they emerged from that ideal time in which they did not yet exist—","So that it and the City of the Lilies were not just artificial scenes which I could set up at my pleasure in front of my imagination, but did actually exist at a certain distance from Paris which must inevitably be traversed if I wished to see them, at their appointed place on the earth's surface, and at no other; in a word they were entirely real.

"Peut-être sentait-elle qu’il ne pourrait pas y réussir, et même craignait-elle que rien qu’en parlant d’elle il ne provoquât des révélations qu’elle redoutait. Toujours est-il qu’elle lui avait fait promettre de ne jamais prononcer son nom. La raison pour laquelle elle ne voulait pas aller dans le monde, lui avait-elle dit, était une brouille qu’elle avait eue autrefois avec une amie qui, pour se venger, avait ensuite dit du mal d’elle. Swann objectait : « Mais tout le monde n’a pas connu ton amie. » – « Mais si, ça fait la tache d’huile, le monde est si méchant. » D’une part Swann ne comprit pas cette histoire, mais d’autre part il savait que ces propositions : « Le monde est si méchant » et « un propos calomnieux fait la tache d’huile », sont généralement tenues pour vraies ; il devait y avoir des cas auxquels elles s’appliquaient. Celui d’Odette était-il l’un de ceux-là ? Il se le demandait, mais pas longtemps, car il était sujet, lui aussi, à cette lourdeur d’esprit qui s’appesantissait sur son père, quand il se posait un problème difficile. D’ailleurs, ce monde qui faisait si peur à Odette ne lui inspirait peut-être pas de grands désirs, car pour qu’elle se le représentât bien nettement, il était trop éloigné de celui qu’elle connaissait. Pourtant, tout en étant restée à certains égards vraiment simple (elle avait par exemple gardé pour amie une petite couturière retirée dont elle grimpait presque chaque jour l’escalier raide, obscur et fétide), elle avait soif de chic, mais ne s’en faisait pas la même idée que les gens du monde. Pour eux, le chic est une émanation de quelques personnes peu nombreuses qui le projettent jusqu’à un degré assez éloigné – et plus ou moins affaibli dans la mesure où l’on est distant du centre de leur intimité – dans le cercle de leurs amis ou des amis de leurs amis dont les noms forment une sorte de répertoire. Les gens du monde le possèdent dans leur mémoire, ils ont sur ces matières une érudition d’où ils ont extrait une sorte de goût, de tact, si bien que Swann par exemple, sans avoir besoin de faire appel à son savoir mondain, s’il lisait dans un journal les noms des personnes qui se trouvaient à un dîner pouvait dire immédiatement la nuance du chic de ce dîner, comme un lettré, à la simple lecture d’une phrase, apprécie exactement la qualité littéraire de son auteur. Mais Odette faisait partie des personnes (extrêmement nombreuses quoi qu’en pensent les gens du monde, et comme il y en a dans toutes les classes de la société) qui ne possèdent pas ces notions, imaginent un chic tout autre, qui revêt divers aspects selon le milieu auquel elles appartiennent, mais a pour caractère particulier – que ce soit celui dont rêvait Odette, ou celui devant lequel s’inclinait MmeCottard – d’être directement accessible à tous. L’autre, celui des gens du monde, l’est à vrai dire aussi, mais il y faut quelque délai. Odette disait de quelqu’un :","Perhaps she felt that he could not succeed, and she even feared that nothing by speaking of her would provoke revelations that she dreaded. Still, she had made him promise never to say her name. The reason she didn't want to go out into the world, she told him, was a falling out she had once had with a friend who, in revenge, had then spoken ill of her. Swann objected: “But not everyone knew your friend. – “But yes, it does the oil stain, the world is so wicked. On the one hand Swann did not understand this story, but on the other hand he knew that these propositions: “The world is so wicked” and “a slanderous statement spreads oil” are generally held to be true; there had to be cases to which they applied. Was Odette's one of those? He wondered, but not for long, because he, too, was subject to that heaviness of spirit that weighed on his father when he faced a difficult problem. Besides, this world which frightened Odette so much perhaps did not inspire her with great desires, for for her to picture it clearly to herself, it was too far removed from the one she knew. However, while having remained in certain respects really simple (she had kept for a friend, for example, a little retired seamstress whose steep, dark and fetid staircase she climbed almost every day), she had a thirst for chic, but did not give up on it. did not have the same idea as the people of the world. For them, chic is an emanation of a few few people who project it to a fairly distant degree – and more or less weakened insofar as one is distant from the center of their intimacy – in the circle of their friends. or friends of their friends whose names form a kind of directory. The people of the world possess it in their memory, they have an erudition on these matters from which they have extracted a kind of taste, of tact, so that Swann for example, without needing to appeal to his worldly knowledge, s he read in a newspaper the names of the people who were at a dinner could immediately tell the nuance of the chic of this dinner, as a scholar, by simply reading a sentence, appreciates exactly the literary quality of its author. But Odette was one of the people (extremely numerous whatever people in the world think of it, and as there are in all classes of society) who do not possess these notions, imagine a completely different chic, which takes on various aspects according to the environment to which they belong, but has the particular character – whether it is the one Odette dreamed of, or the one before which Mme Cottard bowed – of being directly accessible to all. The other, that of the people of the world, is, to tell the truth, also, but it requires some delay. Odette said of someone:","Perhaps she felt that he might not be successful, or was even afraid that merely by talking about her he would prompt revelations that she dreaded. In any case, she had made him promise never to utter her name. The reason she did not want to go into society, she had told him, was a quarrel she had once had with a friend who, to avenge herself, had then said bad things about her. Swann objected: “But not everyone knew your friend.” “Well, yes, but these things get around. The world is cruel.” Swann did not understand this story, but on the other hand he knew that such precepts—“The world is cruel,” “A slanderous remark spreads like a drop of oil”—were generally held to be true; there must be cases to which they applied. Was Odette’s one of them? He wondered about this, but not for long, because he, too, was subject to the mental torpor that had burdened his father whenever he posed himself a difficult problem. Besides, this world which so frightened Odette did not, perhaps, inspire any great desire in her, because it was too far removed from the one she knew for her to picture it quite clearly. However, while she had remained in certain respects truly simple (for example she had kept as her friend a solitary little seamstress, whose steep, dark, and foul-smelling stair she climbed almost every day), she thirsted after fashion, but did not conceive of it as the fashionable people did. For them, fashion is a thing that emanates from a small number of individuals who project it to a considerable distance—more and more faintly the farther one is from the center of their closest associations—through the circle of their friends or the friends of their friends, whose names form a sort of register. Society people hold this register in their memory, they have an erudition about such matters, from which they have derived a sort of taste, a sort of discernment, so that if Swann, for example, read in a newspaper the names of the people who were at a dinner, he could immediately, without having to call upon his knowledge of the world, tell the exact degree of stylishness of that dinner, the way a literary person, simply by reading a sentence, can judge exactly the quality of its author. But Odette was one of those people (extremely numerous, whatever the fashionable world may think, and the likes of which exist in every class of society) who do not share these notions, who imagine a stylishness that is quite different, that assumes different guises according to the circle to which they belong, but has the particular characteristic—whether it be the sort of stylishness Odette dreamed of, or the sort Mme. Cottard worshiped—of being directly accessible to everyone. The other, the stylishness of the society people, is accessible too, in truth, but only after a certain delay. Odette would say of someone:","Perhaps she felt that such attempts would be bound to fail; perhaps, indeed, she feared lest, merely by speaking of her to his friends, he should provoke disclosures of an unwelcome kind. The fact remains that she had consistently held him to his promise never to mention her name. Her reason for not wishing to go into society was, she had told him, a quarrel which she had had, long ago, with another girl, who had avenged herself by saying nasty things about her. "" But,"" Swann objected, ""surely, people don't all know your friend."" ""Yes, don't you see, it's like a spot of oil; people are so horrid. "" Swann was unable, frankly, to appreciate this point; on the other hand, he knew that such generalisations as ""People are so horrid,"" and ""A word of scandal spreads like a spot of oil,"" were generally accepted as true; there must, therefore, be cases to which they were literally applicable. Could Odette's case be one of these? He teased himself with the question, though not for long, for he too was subject to that mental oppression which had so weighed upon his father, whenever he was faced by a difficult problem. In any event, that world of society which concealed such terrors for Odette inspired her, probably, with no very great longing to enter it, since it was too far removed from the world which she already knew for her to be able to form any clear conception of it. At the same time, while in certain respects she had retained a genuine simplicity (she had, for instance, kept up a friendship with a little dressmaker, now retired from business, up whose steep and dark and fetid staircase she clambered almost every day), she still thirsted to be in the fashion, though her idea of it was not altogether that held by fashionable people. For the latter, fashion is a thing that emanates from a comparatively small number of leaders, who project it to a considerable distance—with more or less strength according as one is nearer to or farther from their intimate centre—over the widening circle of their friends and the friends of their friends, whose names form a sort of tabulated index. People 'in society' know this index by heart, they are gifted in such matters with an erudition from which they have extracted a sort of taste, of tact, so automatic in its operation that Swann, for example, without needing to draw upon his knowledge of the world, if he read in a newspaper the names of the people who had been guests at a dinner, could tell at once how fashionable the dinner had been, just as a man of letters, merely by reading a phrase, can estimate exactly the literary merit of its author. But Odette was one of those persons (an extremely numerous class, whatever the fashionable world may think, and to be found in every section of society) who do not share this knowledge, but imagine fashion to be something of quite another kind, which assumes different aspects according to the circle to which they themselves belong, but has the special characteristic—common alike to the fashion of which Odette used to dream and to that before which Mme. Cottard bowed—of being directly accessible to all. The other kind, the fashion of 'fashionable people,' is, it must be admitted, accessible also; but there are inevitable delays. Odette would say of some one: ""He never goes to any place that isn't really smart."""

"Même à Paris, dans un des quartiers les plus laids de la ville, je sais une fenêtre où on voit après un premier, un second et même un troisième plan fait des toits amoncelés de plusieurs rues, une cloche violette, parfois rougeâtre, parfois aussi, dans les plus nobles « épreuves » qu’en tire l’atmosphère, d’un noir décanté de cendres, laquelle n’est autre que le dôme Saint-Augustin et qui donne à cette vue de Paris le caractère de certaines vues de Rome par Piranesi. Mais comme dans aucune de ces petites gravures, avec quelque goût que ma mémoire ait pu les exécuter, elle ne put mettre ce que j’avais perdu depuis longtemps, le sentiment qui nous fait non pas considérer une chose comme un spectacle, mais y croire comme en un être sans équivalent, aucune d’elles ne tient sous sa dépendance toute une partie profonde de ma vie, comme fait le souvenir de ces aspects du clocher de Combray dans les rues qui sont derrière l’église. Qu’on le vît à cinq heures, quand on allait chercher les lettres à la poste, à quelques maisons de soi, à gauche, surélevant brusquement d’une cime isolée la ligne de faîte des toits ; que si, au contraire, on voulait entrer demander des nouvelles de MmeSazerat, on suivît des yeux cette ligne redevenue basse après la descente de son autre versant en sachant qu’il faudrait tourner à la deuxième rue après le clocher ; soit qu’encore, poussant plus loin, si on allait à la gare, on le vît obliquement, montrant de profil des arêtes et des surfaces nouvelles comme un solide surpris à un moment inconnu de sa révolution ; ou que, des bords de la Vivonne, l’abside musculeusement ramassée et remontée par la perspective semblât jaillir de l’effort que le clocher faisait pour lancer sa flèche au cœur du ciel ; c’était toujours à lui qu’il fallait revenir, toujours lui qui dominait tout, sommant les maisons d’un pinacle inattendu, levé devant moi comme le doigt de Dieu dont le corps eût été caché dans la foule des humains sans que je le confondisse pour cela avec elle. Et aujourd’hui encore si, dans une grande ville de province ou dans un quartier de Paris que je connais mal, un passant qui m’a « mis dans mon chemin » me montre au loin, comme un point de repère, tel beffroi d’hôpital, tel clocher de couvent levant la pointe de son bonnet ecclésiastique au coin d’une rue que je dois prendre, pour peu que ma mémoire puisse obscurément lui trouver quelque trait de ressemblance avec la figure chère et disparue, le passant, s’il se retourne pour s’assurer que je ne m’égare pas, peut, à son étonnement, m’apercevoir qui, oublieux de la promenade entreprise ou de la course obligée, reste là, devant le clocher, pendant des heures, immobile, essayant de me souvenir, sentant au fond de moi des terres reconquises sur l’oubli qui s’assèchent et se rebâtissent ; et sans doute alors, et plus anxieusement que tout à l’heure quand je lui demandais de me renseigner, je cherche encore mon chemin, je tourne une rue… mais… c’est dans mon cœur…","Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest neighborhoods of the city, I know of a window where one sees after a first, a second and even a third plan made of the piled up roofs of several streets, a violet bell, sometimes reddish, sometimes also , in the most noble ""proofs"" that the atmosphere draws from it, of a black decanted with ashes, which is none other than the Saint-Augustin dome and which gives this view of Paris the character of certain views of Rome by Piranesi. But as in none of these little engravings, with whatever taste my memory may have executed them, it could not put what I had long since lost, the feeling which makes us not regard a thing as a spectacle, but believe in it. as in a being without equivalent, none of them holds under its dependence a whole profound part of my life, as does the memory of these aspects of the steeple of Combray in the streets which are behind the church. That one saw it at five o'clock, when one went to fetch letters from the post office, a few houses from one, to the left, suddenly raising with an isolated peak the line of the ridge of the roofs; that if, on the contrary, you wanted to go in and ask for news of Madame Sazerat, you would follow this line with your eyes, which had become low again after the descent of its other side, knowing that you would have to turn at the second street after the steeple; or that, pushing further, if you went to the station, you saw it obliquely, showing new edges and surfaces in profile like a solid surprised at an unknown moment in its revolution; or that, from the banks of the Vivonne, the apse muscularly gathered up and raised by the perspective seemed to spring from the effort that the steeple made to launch its spire into the heart of the sky; it was always to him that I had to return, always to him who dominated everything, surmounting the houses with an unexpected pinnacle, raised before me like the finger of God whose body had been hidden in the crowd of humans without my confused for that with her. And even today if, in a large provincial town or in a district of Paris that I don't know well, a passer-by who ""put me in my way"" shows me in the distance, like a landmark, such a belfry of hospital, like a convent steeple raising the tip of its ecclesiastical bonnet at the corner of a street that I must take, if only my memory can obscurely find in it some trait of resemblance to the dear and disappeared figure, the passer-by, he turns around to make sure I haven't lost my way, can, to his astonishment, see me who, oblivious to the walk undertaken or the rush that has to be done, remains there, in front of the steeple, for hours, motionless, trying to remember, feeling deep inside me lands reclaimed from oblivion that are drying up and rebuilding themselves; and no doubt then, and more anxiously than earlier when I asked him to find out more, I am still looking for my way, I turn a street... but... it is in my heart...","Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of the city, I know a window from which you can see, beyond a foreground, middle ground, and even third ground composed of the piled-up roofs of several streets, a violet bell, sometimes ruddy, sometimes also, in the noblest “proofs” of it printed by the atmosphere, a decanted cindery black, which is in fact the dome of Saint-Augustin and which gives this view of Paris the character of certain views of Rome by Piranesi. But since into none of these little engravings, with whatever taste my memory may have executed them, was it able to put what I had lost a long time ago, the feeling that makes us not consider a thing a spectacle, but believe in it as in a creature without equivalent, none of them holds in subjection an entire profound part of my life, as does the memory of those views of the Combray steeple from the streets behind the church. Whether we saw it at five o’clock, when we went to get the letters at the post office, a few houses away from us to the left, abruptly lifting with an isolated peak the ridgeline of the roofs; or whether, on the other hand, if we wanted to go in to ask for news of Mme. Sazerat, our eyes followed that line, low again after the descent of its other slope, knowing we would have to turn at the second street after the steeple; or whether, again, going on farther, if we went to the station, we saw it obliquely, showing in profile new edges and surfaces like a solid caught at an unfamiliar moment of its revolution; or whether, from the banks of the Vivonne, the apse, muscularly gathered and raised to a greater height by the perspective, seemed to spring with the effort the steeple was making to hurl its spire into the heart of the sky: it was always to the steeple that we had to return, always the steeple that dominated everything, summing up the houses with an unexpected pinnacle, raised before me like the finger of God, whose body might be hidden in the crowd of humans, though I would not confuse it with them because of that. And even today, if in a large provincial town or a part of Paris I do not know well, a passing stranger who has “put me on the right path” shows me in the distance, as a reference point, some hospital belfry, some convent steeple lifting the peak of its ecclesiastical cap at the corner of a street I am supposed to take, if only my memory can obscurely find in it some small feature resembling the dear departed form, the stranger, if he turns around to make sure I am not going astray, may, to his astonishment, see me, forgetting the walk I had begun or the necessary errand, remain there in front of the steeple for hours, motionless, trying to remember, feeling deep in myself lands recovered from oblivion draining and rebuilding themselves; and then no doubt, and more anxiously than a short time before when I asked him to direct me, I am still seeking my path, I am turning a corner . . . but . . . I am doing so in my heart . . .","Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of the town, I know a window from which one can see across a first, a second, and even a third layer of jumbled roofs, street beyond street, a violet bell, sometimes ruddy, sometimes too, in the finest 'prints' which the atmosphere makes of it, of an ashy solution of black; which is, in fact, nothing else than the dome of Saint-Augustin, and which imparts to this view of Paris the character of some of the Piranesi views of Rome. But since into none of these little etchings, whatever the taste my memory may have been able to bring to their execution, was it able to contribute an element I have long lost, the feeling which makes us not merely regard a thing as a spectacle, but believe in it as in a creature without parallel, so none of them keeps in dependence on it a whole section of my inmost life as does the memory of those aspects of the steeple of Combray from the streets behind the church. Whether one saw it at five o'clock when going to call for letters at the post-office, some doors away from one, on the left, raising abruptly with its isolated peak the ridge of housetops; or again, when one had to go in and ask for news of Mme. Sazerat, one's eyes followed the line where it ran low again beyond the farther, descending slope, and one knew that it would be the second turning after the steeple; or yet again, if pressing further afield one went to the station, one saw it obliquely, shewing in profile fresh angles and surfaces, like a solid body surprised at some unknown point in its revolution; or, from the banks of the Vivonne, the apse, drawn muscularly together and heightened in perspective, seemed to spring upwards with the effort which the steeple made to hurl its spire-point into the heart of heaven: it was always to the steeple that one must return, always it which dominated everything else, summing up the houses with an unexpected pinnacle, raised before me like the Finger of God, Whose Body might have been concealed below among the crowd of human bodies without fear of my confounding It, for that reason, with them. And so even to-day in any large provincial town, or in a quarter of Paris which I do not know well, if a passer-by who is 'putting me on the right road' shews me from afar, as a point to aim at, some belfry of a hospital, or a convent steeple lifting the peak of its ecclesiastical cap at the corner of the street which I am to take, my memory need only find in it some dim resemblance to that dear and vanished outline, and the passer-by, should he turn round to make sure that I have not gone astray, would see me, to his astonishment, oblivious of the walk that I had planned to take or the place where I was obliged to call, standing still on the spot, before that steeple, for hours on end, motionless, trying to remember, feeling deep within myself a tract of soil reclaimed from the waters of Lethe slowly drying until the buildings rise on it again; and then no doubt, and then more uneasily than when, just now, I asked him for a direction, I will seek my way again, I will turn a corner... but... the goal is in my heart..."

"Mais le concert recommença et Swann comprit qu’il ne pourrait pas s’en aller avant la fin de ce nouveau numéro du programme. Il souffrait de rester enfermé au milieu de ces gens dont la bêtise et les ridicules le frappaient d’autant plus douloureusement qu’ignorant son amour, incapables, s’ils l’avaient connu, de s’y intéresser et de faire autre chose que d’en sourire comme d’un enfantillage ou de le déplorer comme une folie, ils le lui faisaient apparaître sous l’aspect d’un état subjectif qui n’existait que pour lui, dont rien d’extérieur ne lui affirmait la réalité ; il souffrait surtout, et au point que même le son des instruments lui donnait envie de crier, de prolonger son exil dans ce lieu où Odette ne viendrait jamais, où personne, où rien ne la connaissait, d’où elle était entièrement absente.","But the concert started again and Swann understood that he could not leave before the end of this new number of the program. He suffered from remaining locked up in the midst of these people whose stupidity and ridiculousness struck him all the more painfully because they were unaware of his love, incapable, if they had known him, of taking an interest in it and of doing anything other than to smile at it as childishness or to deplore it as madness, they made it appear to him under the aspect of a subjective state which existed only for him, of which nothing external affirmed the reality to him; he suffered above all, and to the point that even the sound of the instruments made him want to cry out, to prolong his exile in this place where Odette would never come, where no one, where nothing knew her, from where she was entirely absent.","But the concert was beginning again and Swann realized he would not be able to leave before the end of this new number.

He suffered greatly from being shut up among all these people whose stupidity and absurdities wounded him all the more cruelly since, being ignorant of his love, incapable, had they known of it, of taking any interest, or of doing more than smile at it as at some childish joke, or deplore it as an act of insanity, they made it appear to him in the aspect of a subjective state which existed for himself alone, whose reality there was nothing external to confirm; he suffered overwhelmingly, to the point at which even the sound of the instruments made him want to cry, from having to prolong his exile in this place to which Odette would never come, in which no one, nothing was aware of her existence, from which she was entirely absent."
"– Je vais vous paraître bien provinciale, monsieur, dit MmeCottard à Swann, mais je n’ai pas encore vu cette fameuse Francillon dont tout le monde parle. Le docteur y est allé (je me rappelle même qu’il m’a dit avoir eu le très grand plaisir de passer la soirée avec vous) et j’avoue que je n’ai pas trouvé raisonnable qu’il louât des places pour y retourner avec moi. Évidemment, au Théâtre-Français, on ne regrette jamais sa soirée, c’est toujours si bien joué, mais comme nous avons des amis très aimables (MmeCottard prononçait rarement un nom propre et se contentait de dire « des amis à nous », « une de mes amies », par « distinction », sur un ton factice, et avec l’air d’importance d’une personne qui ne nomme que qui elle veut) qui ont souvent des loges et ont la bonne idée de nous emmener à toutes les nouveautés qui en valent la peine, je suis toujours sûre de voir Francillon un peu plus tôt ou un peu plus tard, et de pouvoir me former une opinion.","""I'm going to seem very provincial to you, sir,"" said Madame Cottard to Swann, ""but I haven't yet seen that famous Francillon everyone is talking about. The doctor went there (I even remember that he told me that he had had the great pleasure of spending the evening with you) and I confess that I did not find it reasonable for him to rent places for go back with me. Of course, at the Théâtre-Français, you never regret your evening, it's always played so well, but since we have very kind friends (Mme Cottard rarely pronounced a proper name and was content to say ""friends of ours"", "" one of my friends"", by ""distinction"", in a fake tone, and with the air of importance of a person who only names whomever she wants) who often have dressing rooms and have the good idea to take us to all the novelties that are worth it, I'm always sure to see Francillon a little earlier or a little later, and to be able to form an opinion.","“I’m going to seem very provincial to you, monsieur,” said Mme. Cottard to Swann, “ but I haven’t yet seen the famous Francillon everyone’s talking about. The doctor has already gone (I even recall that he told me he had the very great pleasure of spending the evening with you) and I confess that I didn’t find it reasonable that he should pay for seats to go again with me.

Cottard rarely uttered a proper name and simply referred to “some friends of ours” or “one of my friends,” because it was more “distinguished,” speaking in an artificial tone and with the air of importance of a person who names only those she chooses to) “who often have a box and are kind enough to take us to all the new productions that are worth going to, I’m certain to see Francillon sooner or later, and then I can form an opinion for myself.","""You will think me dreadfully provincial, sir,"" said Mme. Cottard to Swann, ""but, do you know, I haven't been yet to this famous Francillon that everybody's talking about. The Doctor has been (I remember now, he told me what a very great pleasure it had been to him to spend the evening with you there) and I must confess, I don't see much sense in spending money on seats for him to take me, when he's seen the play already. Of course an evening at the Théâtre-Français is never wasted, really; the acting's so good there always; but we have some very nice friends,"" (Mme. Cottard would hardly ever utter a proper name, but restricted herself to ""some friends of ours"" or ""one of my friends,"" as being more 'distinguished,' speaking in an affected tone and with all the importance of a person who need give names only when she chooses) ""who often have a box, and are kind enough to take us to all the new pieces that are worth going to, and so I'm certain to see this Francillon sooner or later, and then I shall know what to think."

"Vinteuil le disait ; et il est en effet remarquable combien une personne excite toujours d’admiration pour ses qualités morales chez les parents de toute autre personne avec qui elle a des relations charnelles. L’amour physique, si injustement décrié, force tellement tout être à manifester jusqu’aux moindres parcelles qu’il possède de bonté, d’abandon de soi, qu’elles resplendissent jusqu’aux yeux de l’entourage immédiat. Le docteur Percepied à qui sa grosse voix et ses gros sourcils permettaient de tenir tant qu’il voulait le rôle de perfide dont il n’avait pas le physique, sans compromettre en rien sa réputation inébranlable et imméritée de bourru bienfaisant, savait faire rire aux larmes le curé et tout le monde en disant d’un ton rude : « Hé bien ! il paraît qu’elle fait de la musique avec son amie, MlleVinteuil. Ça a l’air de vous étonner. Moi je sais pas. C’est le père Vinteuil qui m’a encore dit ça hier. Après tout, elle a bien le droit d’aimer la musique, c’te fille. Moi je ne suis pas pour contrarier les vocations artistiques des enfants. Vinteuil non plus à ce qu’il paraît. Et puis lui aussi il fait de la musique avec l’amie de sa fille. Ah ! sapristi on en fait une musique dans c’te boîte-là. Mais qu’est-ce que vous avez à rire ; mais ils font trop de musique ces gens. L’autre jour j’ai rencontré le père Vinteuil près du cimetière. Il ne tenait pas sur ses jambes. »","Vinteuil said so; and it is indeed remarkable how much a person always excites admiration for his moral qualities in the parents of any other person with whom he has carnal relations. Physical love, so unjustly decried, so forces every being to manifest even the smallest parcels that he possesses of kindness, of self-surrender, that they shine even in the eyes of the immediate entourage. Dr. Percepied, whose big voice and big eyebrows allowed him to play as long as he wanted the role of perfidious man for whom he did not have the physical appearance, without in any way compromising his unshakable and undeserved reputation as a benevolent gruff man, knew how to make people laugh. the priest and everyone in tears, saying harshly: “Well! it seems that she makes music with her friend, Mlle Vinteuil. It seems to surprise you. Me, I do not know. It was Father Vinteuil who told me that again yesterday. After all, she has every right to like music, that girl. I am not for upsetting the artistic vocations of children. Vinteuil either, it seems. And then he too makes music with his daughter's friend. Ah! Goddamn, we make music out of it in that box. But what are you laughing at; but these people make too much music. The other day I met Father Vinteuil near the cemetery. He couldn't stand on his legs. »","M. Vinteuil did say this; and in fact it is remarkable how a person always inspires admiration for her moral qualities in the family of the person with whom she is having carnal relations. Physical love, so unfairly disparaged, compels people to manifest the very smallest particles they possess of goodness, of self-abnegation, so much so that these particles glow even in the eyes of those immediately surrounding them. Dr. Percepied, whose loud voice and thick eyebrows permitted him to play to his heart’s content the role of the villain to which his general appearance was not suited, without in the least compromising his unshakable and undeserved reputation as a kindly old curmudgeon, was capable of making the curé and everyone else laugh until they cried by saying gruffly: “Well, now! It seems young Mlle. Vinteuil is making music with her friend. You seem surprised. Now I don’t know. It was old Vinteuil who told me just yesterday. After all, the girl certainly has a right to enjoy her music. It’s not for me to go against a child’s artistic vocation. Nor Vinteuil either, it seems. And then he himself plays music with his daughter’s friend, as well. Heaven help us! There’s certainly a good deal of music-making going on in that establishment. Well, why are you laughing? They play too much music, those people. The other day I met old Vinteuil near the cemetery. He was ready to drop.”","But M. Vinteuil assured them that it was, and indeed it is remarkable that people never fail to arouse admiration of their normal qualities in the relatives of anyone with whom they are in physical intercourse. Bodily passion, which has been so unjustly decried, compels its victims to display every vestige that is in them of unselfishness and generosity, and so effectively that they shine resplendent in the eyes of all beholders. Dr. Percepied, whose loud voice and bushy eyebrows enabled him to play to his heart's content the part of 'double-dealer,' a part to which he was not, otherwise, adapted, without in the least degree compromising his unassailable and quite unmerited reputation of being a kind-hearted old curmudgeon, could make the Curé and everyone else laugh until they cried by saying in a harsh voice: ""What d'ye say to this, now? It seems that she plays music with her friend, Mile. Vinteuil. That surprises you, does it? Oh, I know nothing, nothing at all. It was Papa Vinteuil who told me all about it yesterday. After all, she has every right to be fond of music, that girl. I should never dream of thwarting the artistic vocation of a child; nor Vinteuil either, it seems. And then he plays music too, with his daughter's friend. Why, gracious heavens, it must be a regular musical box, that house out there! What are you laughing at? I say they've been playing too much music, those people. I met Papa Vinteuil the other day, by the cemetery. It was all he could do to keep on his feet."""
"de Palancy ; dans un portrait de Tintoret, l’envahissement du gras de la joue par l’implantation des premiers poils des favoris, la cassure du nez, la pénétration du regard, la congestion des paupières du docteur du Boulbon. Peut-être ayant toujours gardé un remords d’avoir borné sa vie aux relations mondaines, à la conversation, croyait-il trouver une sorte d’indulgent pardon à lui accordé par les grands artistes, dans ce fait qu’ils avaient eux aussi considéré avec plaisir, fait entrer dans leur œuvre, de tels visages qui donnent à celle-ci un singulier certificat de réalité et de vie, une saveur moderne ; peut-être aussi s’était-il tellement laissé gagner par la frivolité des gens du monde qu’il éprouvait le besoin de trouver dans une œuvre ancienne ces allusions anticipées et rajeunissantes à des noms propres d’aujourd’hui. Peut-être au contraire avait-il gardé suffisamment une nature d’artiste pour que ces caractéristiques individuelles lui causassent du plaisir en prenant une signification plus générale, dès qu’il les apercevait déracinées, délivrées, dans la ressemblance d’un portrait plus ancien avec un original qu’il ne représentait pas. Quoi qu’il en soit, et peut-être parce que la plénitude d’impressions qu’il avait depuis quelque temps, et bien qu’elle lui fût venue plutôt avec l’amour de la musique, avait enrichi même son goût pour la peinture, le plaisir fut plus profond et devait exercer sur Swann une influence durable qu’il trouva à ce moment-là dans la ressemblance d’Odette avec la Zéphora de ce Sandro di Mariano auquel on ne donne plus volontiers son surnom populaire de Botticelli depuis que celui-ci évoque au lieu de l’œuvre véritable du peintre l’idée banale et fausse qui s’en est vulgarisée. Il n’estima plus le visage d’Odette selon la plus ou moins bonne qualité de ses joues et d’après la douceur purement carnée qu’il supposait devoir leur trouver en les touchant avec ses lèvres si jamais il osait l’embrasser, mais comme un écheveau de lignes subtiles et belles que ses regards dévidèrent, poursuivant la courbe de leur enroulement, rejoignant la cadence de la nuque à l’effusion des cheveux et à la flexion des paupières, comme en un portrait d’elle en lequel son type devenait intelligible et clair.","of Palancy; in a portrait of Tintoretto, the invasion of the fat of the cheek by the implantation of the first hairs of the whiskers, the break of the nose, the penetration of the gaze, the congestion of the eyelids of Doctor du Boulbon. Perhaps having always been remorseful for having limited his life to social relations, to conversation, he thought he had found a kind of indulgent pardon granted to him by the great artists, in this fact that they too had considered with pleasure, brings into their work, such faces which give it a singular certificate of reality and life, a modern flavor; perhaps also he had let himself be so won over by the frivolity of society people that he felt the need to find in an old work these anticipated and rejuvenating allusions to proper names of today. Perhaps, on the contrary, he had retained enough of an artist's nature for these individual characteristics to cause him pleasure by taking on a more general meaning, as soon as he saw them uprooted, freed, in the resemblance of an older portrait. with an original that he did not represent. Be that as it may, and perhaps because the plenitude of impressions which he had had for some time, and although it had come to him rather with the love of music, had even enriched his taste for painting, the pleasure was deeper and was to exert on Swann a lasting influence which he found at that time in the resemblance of Odette to the Zephora of this Sandro di Mariano to whom we no longer willingly give his popular nickname of Botticelli since that this one evokes instead of the true work of the painter the banal and false idea which has become popularized. He no longer estimated Odette's face according to the more or less good quality of her cheeks and according to the purely fleshy softness which he supposed he must find in them by touching them with his lips if he ever dared to kiss her, but like a skein of subtle and beautiful lines that her eyes unraveled, pursuing the curve of their winding, joining the rhythm of the nape of the neck to the shedding of the hair and the bending of the eyelids, like a portrait of her in which her type became intelligible and clear.","Swann had always had this peculiar penchant for amusing himself by rediscovering in the paintings of the masters not only the general characteristics of the real world that surrounds us, but what seems on the contrary the least susceptible to generalization, the individual features of the faces we know: for instance, in the material of a bust of the Doge Loredano by Antonio Rizzo,26 the jut of the cheekbones, the slant of the eyebrows, altogether the very evident resemblance to his coachman Rémi; under the colors of a Ghirlandaio,27 M. de Palancy’s nose; in a portrait by Tintoretto,28 the invasion of the cheek’s fat by the first implanted hairs of the side-whiskers, the break in the nose, the penetration of the gaze, the congestion of the eyelids of Dr. du Boulbon. Perhaps because he had always continued to feel a touch of remorse that he had limited his life to worldly relationships, to conversation, he believed he could find a sort of indulgent pardon granted him by the great artists, in the fact that they too had contemplated with pleasure, introduced into their work, faces like these which give it a singular certificate of reality and of truth to life, a modern flavor; perhaps, also, he had allowed himself to be so caught up in the frivolity of the society people that he felt the need to look into an old work of art for these anticipated and rejuvenating allusions to current proper names. Perhaps, on the other hand, he still had enough of an artist’s nature so that these individual characteristics gave him pleasure by assuming a more general meaning as soon as he saw them extirpated, emancipated, in the resemblance between an older portrait and an original which it did not represent. Whatever the case, and perhaps because the abundance of impressions that he had been receiving for some time, and even though this abundance had come to him more with his love of music, had enriched even his delight in painting, he now found a deeper pleasure—and this was to exert a permanent influence on Swann—in Odette’s resemblance to Zipporah as painted by Sandro di Mariano, whom people call more often by his popular nickname of Botticelli, since that name evokes, not the painter’s true work, but the idea of it that is vulgarized, banal, and false. He no longer appraised Odette’s face according to the finer or poorer quality of her cheeks and the purely flesh-colored softness he supposed he must find when he touched them with his lips if he ever dared to kiss her, but as a skein of subtle and beautiful lines that his eyes reeled off, following their winding curve, joining the cadence of her nape to the effusion of her hair and the flexion of her eyelids, as in a portrait of her in which her type became intelligible and clear.","He had always found a peculiar fascination in tracing in the paintings of the Old Masters, not merely the general characteristics of the people whom he encountered in his daily life, but rather what seems least susceptible of generalisation, the individual features of men and women whom he knew, as, for instance, in a bust of the Doge Loredan by Antonio Rizzo, the prominent cheekbones, the slanting eyebrows, in short, a speaking likeness to his own coachman Rémi; in the colouring of a Ghirlandaio, the nose of M. de Palancy; in a portrait by Tintoretto, the invasion of the plumpness of the cheek by an outcrop of whisker, the broken nose, the penetrating stare, the swollen eyelids of Dr. du Boulbon. Perhaps because he had always regretted, in his heart, that he had confined his attention to the social side of life, had talked, always, rather than acted, he felt that he might find a sort of indulgence bestowed upon him by those great artists, in his perception of the fact that they also had regarded with pleasure and had admitted into the canon of their works such types of physiognomy as give those works the strongest possible certificate of reality and trueness to life; a modern, almost a topical savour; perhaps, also, he had so far succumbed to the prevailing frivolity of the world of fashion that he felt the necessity of finding in an old masterpiece some such obvious and refreshing allusion to a person about whom jokes could be made and repeated and enjoyed to-day. Perhaps, on the other hand, he had retained enough of the artistic temperament to be able to find a genuine satisfaction in watching these individual features take on a more general significance when he saw them, uprooted and disembodied, in the abstract idea of similarity between an historic portrait and a modern original, whom it was not intended to represent. However that might be, and perhaps because the abundance of impressions which he, for some time past, had been receiving—though, indeed, they had come to him rather through the channel of his appreciation of music—had enriched his appetite for painting as well , it was with an unusual intensity of pleasure, a pleasure destined to have a lasting effect upon his character and conduct, that Swann remarked Odette's resemblance to the Zipporah of that Alessandro de Mariano, to whom one shrinks from giving his more popular surname, now that 'Botticelli' suggests not so much the actual work of the Master as that false and banal conception of it which has of late obtained common currency. He no longer based his estimate of the merit of Odette's face on the more or less good quality of her cheeks, and the softness and sweetness—as of carnation-petals—which, he supposed, would greet his lips there, should he ever hazard an embrace, but regarded it rather as a skein of subtle and lovely silken threads, which his gazing eyes collected and wound together, following the curving line from the skein to the ball, where he mingled the cadence of her neck with the spring of her hair and the droop of her eyelids, as though from a portrait of herself, in which her type was made clearly intelligible."

"Le plus grand charme du côté de Guermantes, c’est qu’on y avait presque tout le temps à côté de soi le cours de la Vivonne. On la traversait une première fois, dix minutes après avoir quitté la maison, sur une passerelle dite le Pont-Vieux. Dès le lendemain de notre arrivée, le jour de Pâques, après le sermon s’il faisait beau temps, je courais jusque-là, voir dans ce désordre d’un matin de grande fête où quelques préparatifs somptueux font paraître plus sordides les ustensiles de ménage qui traînent encore, la rivière qui se promenait déjà en bleu ciel entre les terres encore noires et nues, accompagnée seulement d’une bande de coucous arrivés trop tôt et de primevères en avance, cependant que çà et là une violette au bec bleu laissait fléchir sa tige sous le poids de la goutte d’odeur qu’elle tenait dans son cornet. Le Pont-Vieux débouchait dans un sentier de halage qui à cet endroit se tapissait l’été du feuillage bleu d’un noisetier sous lequel un pêcheur en chapeau de paille avait pris racine. À Combray où je savais quelle individualité de maréchal ferrant ou de garçon épicier était dissimulée sous l’uniforme du suisse ou le surplis de l’enfant de chœur, ce pêcheur est la seule personne dont je n’aie jamais découvert l’identité. Il devait connaître mes parents, car il soulevait son chapeau quand nous passions ; je voulais alors demander son nom, mais on me faisait signe de me taire pour ne pas effrayer le poisson. Nous nous engagions dans le sentier de halage qui dominait le courant d’un talus de plusieurs pieds ; de l’autre côté la rive était basse, étendue en vastes prés jusqu’au village et jusqu’à la gare qui en était distante. Ils étaient semés des restes, à demi enfouis dans l’herbe, du château des anciens comtes de Combray qui au moyen âge avait de ce côté le cours de la Vivonne comme défense contre les attaques des sires de Guermantes et des abbés de Martinville. Ce n’étaient plus que quelques fragments de tours bossuant la prairie, à peine apparents, quelques créneaux d’où jadis l’arbalétrier lançait des pierres, d’où le guetteur surveillait Novepont, Clairefontaine, Martinville-le-Sec, Bailleau-l’Exempt, toutes terres vassales de Guermantes entre lesquelles Combray était enclavé, aujourd’hui au ras de l’herbe, dominés par les enfants de l’école des frères qui venaient là apprendre leurs leçons ou jouer aux récréations – passé presque descendu dans la terre, couché au bord de l’eau comme un promeneur qui prend le frais, mais me donnant fort à songer, me faisant ajouter dans le nom de Combray à la petite ville d’aujourd’hui une cité très différente, retenant mes pensées par son visage incompréhensible et d’autrefois qu’il cachait à demi sous les boutons d’or. Ils étaient fort nombreux à cet endroit qu’ils avaient choisi pour leurs jeux sur l’herbe, isolés, par couples, par troupes, jaunes comme un jaune d’œuf, brillants d’autant plus, me semblait-il, que ne pouvant dériver vers aucune velléité de dégustation le plaisir que leur vue me causait, je l’accumulais dans leur surface dorée, jusqu’à ce qu’il devînt assez puissant pour produire de l’inutile beauté ; et cela dès ma plus petite enfance, quand du sentier de halage je tendais les bras vers eux sans pouvoir épeler complètement leur joli nom de Princes de contes de fées français, venus peut-être il y a bien des siècles d’Asie, mais apatriés pour toujours au village, contents du modeste horizon, aimant le soleil et le bord de l’eau, fidèles à la petite vue de la gare, gardant encore pourtant comme certaines de nos vieilles toiles peintes, dans leur simplicité populaire, un poétique éclat d’orient.","The greatest charm of the Guermantes side is that you almost always had the course of the Vivonne next to you. We crossed it for the first time, ten minutes after leaving the house, on a footbridge called the Pont-Vieux. The day after our arrival, on Easter Day, after the sermon if the weather was fine, I would run there, see in this disorder of a morning of a great feast where some sumptuous preparations make the kitchen utensils seem more sordid. household still hanging around, the river which was already strolling in sky blue between the lands still black and bare, accompanied only by a band of cuckoos which had arrived too early and primroses in advance, while here and there a violet with a blue beak left bend its stem under the weight of the drop of odor it held in its cone. The Pont-Vieux came out into a towpath which at this point was lined in summer with the blue foliage of a hazel tree under which a fisherman in a straw hat had taken root. In Combray, where I knew what individuality of blacksmith or grocer's boy was concealed under the uniform of the Swiss or the surplice of the altar boy, this fisherman is the only person whose identity I have never discovered. He must have known my parents, for he lifted his hat when we passed; I then wanted to ask his name, but they made me a sign to be quiet so as not to frighten the fish. We entered the towpath which overlooked the current by an embankment several feet high; on the other side the bank was low, extended in vast meadows to the village and to the station which was distant from it. They were strewn with the remains, half buried in the grass, of the castle of the former Counts of Combray which in the Middle Ages had the course of the Vivonne on this side as a defense against the attacks of the Lords of Guermantes and the Abbots of Martinville. There were no more than a few fragments of towers humping over the meadow, barely visible, a few battlements from which the crossbowman once threw stones, from which the lookout watched Novepont, Clairefontaine, Martinville-le-Sec, Bailleau-l. 'Exempt, all vassal lands of Guermantes between which Combray was landlocked, today level with the grass, dominated by the children of the brothers' school who came there to learn their lessons or play at recess - past almost descended into the land, lying at the edge of the water like a walker taking in the fresh air, but giving me much to think about, causing me to add to the name of Combray to the small town of today a very different city, retaining my thoughts by his incomprehensible, old-fashioned face which he half hid under the buttercups. They were very numerous at this place which they had chosen for their games on the grass, isolated, in pairs, in herds, yellow as an egg yolk, all the more brilliant, it seemed to me, as they could not diverting towards any inclination to taste the pleasure that their sight caused me, I accumulated it in their golden surface, until it became powerful enough to produce useless beauty; and that from my earliest childhood, when from the towpath I stretched out my arms towards them without being able to completely spell their pretty name of Princes of French fairy tales, who came perhaps many centuries ago from Asia, but were apatriates forever in the village, happy with the modest horizon, loving the sun and the water's edge, faithful to the small view of the station, yet still retaining, like some of our old painted canvases, in their popular simplicity, a poetic radiance of 'East.","The greatest charm of the Guermantes way was that we had next to us, almost the whole time, the course of the Vivonne. We crossed it first, ten minutes after leaving the house, on a footbridge called the Pont-Vieux. The day after we arrived, following the sermon on Easter Sunday, if the weather was fine, I would run there to see, amid all the disorder that prevails on the morning of a great festival, when the sumptuous preparations make the household utensils that are still lying about appear more sordid than usual, the river already promenading along dressed in sky blue between lands still black and bare, accompanied only by a flock of cuckooflowers that had arrived early and primroses ahead of their time, while here and there a violet with a blue beak bowed its stem under the weight of the drop of fragrance it held in its throat. The Pont-Vieux led to a towpath which at this spot would be draped in summer with the blue foliage of a hazel under which a fisherman in a straw hat had taken root. In Combray, where I knew which particular farrier or grocer’s boy was concealed within the verger’s uniform or choirboy’s surplice, this fisherman is the only person whose identity I never discovered. He must have known my parents, because he would raise his hat when we passed; I would then try to ask his name, but they would signal me to keep quiet so as not to frighten the fish. We would enter the towpath, which ran along an embankment a few feet above the stream; on the other side the bank was low, extending in vast meadows to the village and to the train station far away. They were strewn with the remains, half buried in the grass, of the château of the old counts of Combray, who during the Middle Ages had had the stream of the Vivonne as defense on this side against the attacks of the lords of Guermantes and the abbots of Martinville. These remains were now no more than a few fragments of towers embossing the grassland, barely apparent, a few battlements from which in the old days the crossbowman would hurl stones, from which the watchman would keep an eye on Novepont, Clairefontaine, Martinville-le-Sec, Bailleau-l’Exempt, all of them vassal lands of Guermantes among which Combray was enclosed, today level with the grass, gazed down upon by the children of the friars’ school, who came here to learn their lessons or play at recreation time—a past that had almost descended into the earth, lying by the edge of the water like some hiker enjoying the cool air, but giving me a great deal to think about, making me add to the little town of today, under the name of Combray, a very different town, captivating my thoughts with its incomprehensible face of long ago, which it half concealed under the buttercups. There were a great many of them in this spot, which they had chosen for their games on the grass, solitary, in couples, in groups, yellow as the yellow of an egg, shining all the more, it seemed to me, because, since I could not channel the pleasure which the sight of them gave me into any impulse to taste them, I would let it accumulate in their golden surface, until it became potent enough to produce some useless beauty; and I did this starting from my earliest childhood, when I would stretch my arms out toward them from the towpath though I could not yet correctly spell their pretty name,51 the name of some prince from a French fairy tale, whereas perhaps they had come from Asia many centuries ago, but were now naturalized for good in the village, content with the modest horizon, liking the sun and the water’s edge, faithful to the little view of the station, but still retaining, like some of our old paintings in their folksy simplicity, a poetic luster of the Orient.","The great charm of the 'Guermantes' way was that we had beside us, almost all the time, the course of the Vivonne. We crossed it first, ten minutes after leaving the house, by a foot-bridge called the Pont-Vieux. And every year, when we arrived at Combray, on Easter morning, after the sermon, if the weather was fine, I would run there to see (amid all the disorder that prevails on the morning of a great festival, the gorgeous preparations for which make the everyday household utensils that they have not contrived to banish seem more sordid than ever) the river flowing past, sky-blue already between banks still black and bare, its only companions a clump of daffodils, come out before their time, a few primroses, the first in flower, while here and there burned the blue flame of a violet, its stem bent beneath the weight of the drop of perfume stored in its tiny horn. The Pont-Vieux led to a tow-path which, at this point, would be overhung in summer by the bluish foliage of a hazel, under which a fisherman in a straw hat seemed to have taken root. At Combray, where I knew everyone, and could always detect the blacksmith or grocer's boy through his disguise of a beadle's uniform or chorister's surplice, this fisherman was the only person whom I was never able to identify. He must have known my family, for he used to raise his hat when we passed; and then I would always be just on the point of asking his name, when some one would make a sign to me to be quiet, or I would frighten the fish. We would follow the tow-path which ran along the top of a steep bank, several feet above the stream. The ground on the other side was lower, and stretched in a series of broad meadows as far as the village and even to the distant railway-station. Over these were strewn the remains, half-buried in the long grass, of the castle of the old Counts of Combray, who, during the Middle Ages, had had on this side the course of the Vivonne as a barrier and defence against attack from the Lords of Guermantes and Abbots of Martinville. Nothing was left now but a few stumps of towers, hummocks upon the broad surface of the fields, hardly visible, broken battlements over which, in their day, the bowmen had hurled down stones, the watchmen had gazed out over Novepont, Clairefontaine, Martinville-le-Sec, Bailleau-l'Exempt, fiefs all of them of Guermantes, a ring in which Combray was locked; but fallen among the grass now, levelled with the ground, climbed and commanded by boys from the Christian Brothers' school, who came there in their playtime, or with lesson-books to be conned; emblems of a past that had sunk down and well-nigh vanished under the earth, that lay by the water's edge now, like an idler taking the air, yet giving me strong food for thought, making the name of Combray connote to me not the little town of to-day only, but an historic city vastly different, seizing and holding my imagination by the remote, incomprehensible features which it half-concealed beneath a spangled veil of buttercups. For the buttercups grew past numbering on this spot which they had chosen for their games among the grass, standing singly, in couples, in whole companies, yellow as the yolk of eggs, and glowing with an added lustre, I felt, because, being powerless to consummate with my palate the pleasure which the sight of them never failed to give me, I would let it accumulate as my eyes ranged over their gilded expanse, until it had acquired the strength to create in my mind a fresh example of absolute, unproductive beauty; and so it had been from my earliest childhood, when from the tow-path I had stretched out my arms towards them, before even I could pronounce their charming name—a name fit for the Prince in some French fairy-tale; colonists, perhaps, in some far distant century from Asia, but naturalised now for ever in the village, well satisfied with their modest horizon, rejoicing in the sunshine and the water's edge, faithful to their little glimpse of the railway-station; yet keeping, none the less, as do some of our old paintings, in their plebeian simplicity, a poetic scintillation from the golden East."

"Cette complexité du bois de Boulogne qui en fait un lieu factice et, dans le sens zoologique ou mythologique du mot, un Jardin, je l’ai retrouvée cette année comme je le traversais pour aller à Trianon, un des premiers matins de ce mois de novembre où, à Paris, dans les maisons, la proximité et la privation du spectacle de l’automne qui s’achève si vite sans qu’on y assiste, donnent une nostalgie, une véritable fièvre des feuilles mortes qui peut aller jusqu’à empêcher de dormir. Dans ma chambre fermée, elles s’interposaient depuis un mois, évoquées par mon désir de les voir, entre ma pensée et n’importe quel objet auquel je m’appliquais, et tourbillonnaient comme ces taches jaunes qui parfois, quoi que nous regardions, dansent devant nos yeux. Et ce matin-là, n’entendant plus la pluie tomber comme les jours précédents, voyant le beau temps sourire aux coins des rideaux fermés comme aux coins d’une bouche close qui laisse échapper le secret de son bonheur, j’avais senti que ces feuilles jaunes, je pourrais les regarder traversées par la lumière, dans leur suprême beauté ; et ne pouvant pas davantage me tenir d’aller voir des arbres qu’autrefois, quand le vent soufflait trop fort dans ma cheminée, de partir pour le bord de la mer, j’étais sorti pour aller à Trianon, en passant par le bois de Boulogne. C’était l’heure et c’était la saison où le Bois semble peut-être le plus multiple, non seulement parce qu’il est plus subdivisé, mais encore parce qu’il l’est autrement. Même dans les parties découvertes où l’on embrasse un grand espace, çà et là, en face des sombres masses lointaines des arbres qui n’avaient pas de feuilles ou qui avaient encore leurs feuilles de l’été, un double rang de marronniers orangés semblait, comme dans un tableau à peine commencé, avoir seul encore été peint par le décorateur qui n’aurait pas mis de couleur sur le reste, et tendait son allée en pleine lumière pour la promenade épisodique de personnages qui ne seraient ajoutés que plus tard.","This complexity of the Bois de Boulogne which makes it an artificial place and, in the zoological or mythological sense of the word, a Garden, I rediscovered it this year as I was crossing it to go to Trianon, one of the first mornings of this month of November when, in Paris, in the houses, the proximity and deprivation of the spectacle of autumn which ends so quickly without anyone being present, gives a nostalgia, a real fever of dead leaves which can go as far as prevent sleep. In my closed room, they had been interposed for a month, evoked by my desire to see them, between my thoughts and any object to which I applied myself, and swirled like those yellow spots which sometimes, whatever we looked at, dance before our eyes. And that morning, no longer hearing the rain falling like the previous days, seeing the fine weather smiling at the corners of the closed curtains as at the corners of a closed mouth that lets out the secret of its happiness, I had felt that these yellow leaves, I could watch them traversed by the light, in their supreme beauty; and no more able to restrain myself from going to see the trees than before, when the wind blew too hard in my chimney, from leaving for the seaside, I had gone out to go to Trianon, passing through the woods. from Boulogne. It was the hour and it was the season when the Wood seems perhaps most multiple, not only because it is more subdivided, but also because it is so otherwise. Even in the open parts where one embraces a large space, here and there, opposite the dark distant masses of trees which had no leaves or which still had their summer leaves, a double row of orange chestnut trees seemed, as in a painting just begun, to have been painted alone by the decorator who would not have put any color on the rest, and tended its path in full light for the episodic walk of characters who would not be added until later .","That complexity of the Bois de Boulogne which makes it an artificial place and, in the zoological or mythological sense of the word, a Garden, I discovered again this year as I was crossing it to go to Trianon,36 on one of the first mornings of this month of November when, in Paris, inside the houses, we are so close to the autumn spectacle, and yet denied it, as it rapidly comes to an end without our witnessing it, that we are filled with a yearning, a veritable fever for the dead leaves that may go so far as to stop us from sleeping. In my closed room, they had been coming for a month now, summoned by my desire to see them, between my thoughts and any object to which I applied myself, and they eddied like those yellow spots that sometimes, whatever we may be looking at, dance in front of our eyes. And that morning, no longer hearing the rain fall as on the days before, seeing the fine weather smile at the corners of the drawn curtains as at the corners of a closed mouth that betrays the secret of its happiness, I had felt that I might be able to look at those yellow leaves as the light passed through them, in their supreme beauty; and being no more able to keep myself from going to see the trees than in earlier days, when the wind blew too hard in my chimney, from departing for the seaside, I had left to go to Trianon, by way of the Bois de Boulogne. It was the hour and it was the season when the Bois seems perhaps most multiform, not only because it is more subdivided, but also because it is subdivided in a different way. Even in the open parts where one embraces a great space, here and there, in front of the dark distant masses of the trees that had no leaves or still had their summer leaves, a double row of orange chestnut trees seemed, as in a picture just begun, to be the only thing painted so far by the scene painter, who had not put any color on the rest, and it offered its avenue in full light for the episodic walk of figures that would be added later on.","That sense of the complexity of the Bois de Boulogne which made it an artificial place and, in the zoological or mythological sense of the word, a Garden, I captured again, this year, as I crossed it on my way to Trianon, on one of those mornings, early in November, when in Paris, if we stay indoors, being so near and yet prevented from witnessing the transformation scene of autumn, which is drawing so rapidly to a close without our assistance, we feel a regret for the fallen leaves that becomes a fever, and may even keep us awake at night. Into my closed room they had been drifting already for a month, summoned there by my desire to see them, slipping between my thoughts and the object, whatever it might be, upon which I was trying to concentrate them, whirling in front of me like those brown spots that sometimes, whatever we may be looking at, will seem to be dancing or swimming before our eyes. And on that morning, not hearing the splash of the rain as on the previous days, seeing the smile of fine weather at the corners of my drawn curtains, as from the corners of closed lips may escape the secret of their happiness, I had felt that I could actually see those yellow leaves, with the light shining through them, in their supreme beauty; and being no more able to restrain myself from going to look at the trees than, in my childhood's days, when the wind howled in the chimney, I had been able to resist the longing to visit the sea, I had risen and left the house to go to Trianon, passing through the Bois de Boulogne. It was the hour and the season in which the Bois seems, perhaps, most multiform, not only because it is then most divided, but because it is divided in a different way. Even in the unwooded parts, where the horizon is large, here and there against the background of a dark and distant mass of trees, now leafless or still keeping their summer foliage unchanged, a double row of orange-red chestnuts seemed, as in a picture just begun, to be the only thing painted, so far, by an artist who had not yet laid any colour on the rest, and to be offering their cloister, in full daylight, for the casual exercise of the human figures that would be added to the picture later on."
"C’est qu’aussi – comme il arrive dans ces moments de rêverie au milieu de la nature où l’action de l’habitude étant suspendue, nos notions abstraites des choses mises de côté, nous croyons d’une foi profonde à l’originalité, à la vie individuelle du lieu où nous nous trouvons – la passante qu’appelait mon désir me semblait être non un exemplaire quelconque de ce type général : la femme, mais un produit nécessaire et naturel de ce sol. Car en ce temps-là tout ce qui n’était pas moi, la terre et les êtres, me paraissait plus précieux, plus important, doué d’une existence plus réelle que cela ne paraît aux hommes faits. Et la terre et les êtres, je ne les séparais pas. J’avais le désir d’une paysanne de Méséglise ou de Roussainville, d’une pêcheuse de Balbec, comme j’avais le désir de Méséglise et de Balbec. Le plaisir qu’elles pouvaient me donner m’aurait paru moins vrai, je n’aurais plus cru en lui, si j’en avais modifié à ma guise les conditions. Connaître à Paris une pêcheuse de Balbec ou une paysanne de Méséglise, c’eût été recevoir des coquillages que je n’aurais pas vus sur la plage, une fougère que je n’aurais pas trouvée dans les bois, c’eût été retrancher au plaisir que la femme me donnerait tous ceux au milieu desquels l’avait enveloppée mon imagination. Mais errer ainsi dans les bois de Roussainville sans une paysanne à embrasser, c’était ne pas connaître de ces bois le trésor caché, la beauté profonde. Cette fille que je ne voyais que criblée de feuillages, elle était elle-même pour moi comme une plante locale d’une espèce plus élevée seulement que les autres et dont la structure permet d’approcher de plus près qu’en elles la saveur profonde du pays. Je pouvais d’autant plus facilement le croire (et que les caresses par lesquelles elle m’y ferait parvenir seraient aussi d’une sorte particulière et dont je n’aurais pas pu connaître le plaisir par une autre qu’elle), que j’étais pour longtemps encore à l’âge où on ne l’a pas encore abstrait ce plaisir de la possession des femmes différentes avec lesquelles on l’a goûté, où on ne l’a pas réduit à une notion générale qui les fait considérer dès lors comme des instruments interchangeables d’un plaisir toujours identique. Il n’existe même pas, isolé, séparé et formulé dans l’esprit, comme le but qu’on poursuit en s’approchant d’une femme, comme la cause du trouble préalable qu’on ressent. À peine y songe-t-on comme un plaisir qu’on aura ; plutôt, on l’appelle son charme à elle ; car on ne pense pas à soi, on ne pense qu’à sortir de soi. Obscurément attendu, immanent et caché, il porte seulement à un tel paroxysme au moment où il s’accomplit les autres plaisirs que nous causent les doux regards, les baisers de celle qui est auprès de nous, qu’il nous apparaît surtout à nous-même comme une sorte de transport de notre reconnaissance pour la bonté de cœur de notre compagne et pour sa touchante prédilection à notre égard que nous mesurons aux bienfaits, au bonheur dont elle nous comble.","It is also - as happens in those moments of reverie in the midst of nature when the action of habit being suspended, our abstract notions of things set aside, we believe with a deep faith in originality, to the individual life of the place where we find ourselves – the passerby that my desire called for seemed to me to be not just any example of this general type: the woman, but a necessary and natural product of this soil. Because at that time everything that was not me, the earth and beings, seemed to me more precious, more important, endowed with a more real existence than it seems to grown men. And the earth and beings, I did not separate them. I wanted a peasant woman from Méséglise or Roussainville, a fisherwoman from Balbec, just as I wanted Méséglise and Balbec. The pleasure they could give me would have seemed less real to me, I would no longer have believed in him, if I had modified the conditions as I pleased. To know a fisherwoman from Balbec or a peasant woman from Méséglise in Paris would have been to receive shells that I would not have seen on the beach, a fern that I would not have found in the woods, would have been to cut off from the pleasure that woman would give me all those in the midst of which my imagination had enveloped her. But to wander thus in the woods of Roussainville without a peasant woman to embrace, was to not know of these woods the hidden treasure, the profound beauty. This girl whom I saw only riddled with foliage, she was herself for me like a local plant of a species only higher than the others and whose structure allows one to approach more closely than in them the deep flavor from the country. I could believe it all the more easily (and since the caresses by which she would get me there would also be of a particular kind and whose pleasure I could not have known from anyone other than her), that I I was for a long time still at the age when it has not yet been abstracted from this pleasure of possessing the different women with whom it has been tasted, when it has not been reduced to a general notion which makes them consider henceforth like interchangeable instruments of an always identical pleasure. It does not even exist, isolated, separated and formulated in the mind, as the goal one pursues in approaching a woman, as the cause of the prior trouble one feels. We hardly think of it as a pleasure we will have; rather, it is called her own charm; because we do not think of ourselves, we only think of getting out of ourselves. Obscurely awaited, immanent and hidden, it only brings to such a paroxysm at the moment when it is accomplished the other pleasures that the sweet glances, the kisses of the one who is near us cause us, that it appears to us above all to ourselves. even as a sort of transport of our gratitude for the kindness of our companion's heart and for her touching predilection for us, which we measure by the benefits, the happiness with which she fills us.","And, too—just as during those moments of reverie in the midst of nature when, the effect of habit being suspended, and our abstract notions of things set aside, we believe with a profound faith in the originality, in the individual life of the place in which we happen to be—the passing woman summoned by my desire seemed to be, not an ordinary exemplar of that general type—woman—but a necessary and natural product of this particular soil. For at that time everything which was not I, the earth and other people, appeared to me more precious, more important, endowed with a more real existence than they appear to grown men. And I did not separate the earth and the people. I desired a peasant girl from Méséglise or Roussainville, a fisherwoman from Balbec, just as I desired Méséglise and Balbec. The pleasure they might give me would have appeared less real to me, I would no longer have believed in it, if I had modified its conditions as I pleased. To meet a fisherwoman from Balbec or a countrywoman from Méséglise in Paris would have been like receiving a seashell I could not have seen on the beach, a fern I could not have found in the woods, it would have subtracted from the pleasure which the woman would give me all those pleasures in which my imagination had enveloped her. But to wander through the woods of Roussainville without a peasant girl to hold in my arms was to see these woods and yet know nothing of their hidden treasure, their profound beauty. For me that girl, whom I could only envisage dappled with leaves, was herself like a local plant, merely of a higher species than the rest and whose structure enabled one to approach more closely than one could in the others the essential flavor of the country. I could believe this all the more readily (and also that the caresses by which she would allow me to reach that flavor would themselves be of a special kind, whose pleasure I would not have been able to experience through anyone else but her) because I was, and would be for a long time to come, at an age when one has not yet abstracted this pleasure from the possession of the different women with whom one has tasted it, when one has not reduced it to a general notion that makes one regard them from then on as the interchangeable instruments of a pleasure that is always the same. This pleasure does not even exist, isolated, distinct and formulated in the mind, as the aim we are pursuing when we approach a woman, as the cause of the previous disturbance that we feel. We scarcely even contemplate it as a pleasure which we will enjoy; rather, we call it her charm; for we do not think of ourselves, we think only of leaving ourselves. Obscurely awaited, immanent and hidden, it merely rouses to such a paroxysm, at the moment of its realization, the other pleasures we find in the soft gazes, the kisses of the woman close to us, that it seems to us, more than anything else, a sort of transport of our gratitude for our companion’s goodness of heart and for her touching predilection for us, which we measure by the blessings, by the beatitude she showers upon us.","Moreover—just as in moments of musing contemplation of nature, the normal actions of the mind being suspended, and our abstract ideas of things set on one side, we believe with the profoundest faith in the originality, in the individual existence of the place in which we may happen to be—the passing figure which my desire evoked seemed to be not any one example of the general type of 'woman,' but a necessary and natural product of the soil. For at that time everything which was not myself, the earth and the creatures upon it, seemed to me more precious, more important, endowed with a more real existence than they appear to full-grown men. And between the earth and its creatures I made no distinction. I had a desire for a peasant-girl from Méséglise or Roussainville, for a fisher-girl from Balbec, just as I had a desire for Balbec and Méséglise. The pleasure which those girls were empowered to give me would have seemed less genuine, I should have had no faith in it any longer, if I had been at liberty to modify its conditions as I chose. To meet in Paris a fisher-girl from Balbec or a peasant-girl from Méséglise would have been like receiving the present of a shell which I had never seen upon the beach, or of a fern which I had never found among the woods, would have stripped from the pleasure which she was about to give me all those other pleasures in the thick of which my imagination had enwrapped her. But to wander thus among the woods of Roussainville without a peasant-girl to embrace was to see those woods and yet know nothing of their secret treasure, their deep-hidden beauty. That girl whom I never saw save dappled with the shadows of their leaves, was to me herself a plant of local growth, only taller than the rest, and one whose structure would enable me to approach more closely than in them to the intimate savour of the land from which she had sprung. I could believe this all the more readily (and also that the caresses by which she would bring that savour to my senses were themselves of a particular kind, yielding a pleasure which I could never derive from any but herself) since I was still, and must for long remain, in that period of life when one has not yet separated the fact of this sensual pleasure from the various women in whose company one has tasted it, when one has not reduced it to a general idea which makes one regard them thenceforward as the variable instruments of a pleasure that is always the same. Indeed, that pleasure does not exist, isolated and formulated in the consciousness, as the ultimate object with which one seeks a woman's company, or as the cause of the uneasiness which, in anticipation, one then feels. Hardly even does one think of oneself, but only how to escape from oneself. Obscurely awaited, immanent and concealed, it rouses to such a paroxysm, at the moment when at last it makes itself felt, those other pleasures which we find in the tender glance, in the kiss of her who is by our side, that it seems to us, more than anything else, a sort of transport of gratitude for the kindness of heart of our companion and for her touching predilection of ourselves, which we measure by the benefits, by the happiness that she showers upon us."

"Pendant que la fille de cuisine – faisant briller involontairement la supériorité de Françoise, comme l’Erreur, par le contraste, rend plus éclatant le triomphe de la Vérité – servait du café qui, selon maman, n’était que de l’eau chaude, et montait ensuite dans nos chambres de l’eau chaude qui était à peine tiède, je m’étais étendu sur mon lit, un livre à la main, dans ma chambre qui protégeait en tremblant sa fraîcheur transparente et fragile contre le soleil de l’après-midi derrière ses volets presque clos où un reflet de jour avait pourtant trouvé moyen de faire passer ses ailes jaunes, et restait immobile entre le bois et le vitrage, dans un coin, comme un papillon posé. Il faisait à peine assez clair pour lire, et la sensation de la splendeur de la lumière ne m’était donnée que par les coups frappés dans la rue de la Cure par Camus (averti par Françoise que ma tante ne « reposait pas » et qu’on pouvait faire du bruit) contre des caisses poussiéreuses, mais qui, retentissant dans l’atmosphère sonore, spéciale aux temps chauds, semblaient faire voler au loin des astres écarlates ; et aussi par les mouches qui exécutaient devant moi, dans leur petit concert, comme la musique de chambre de l’été : elle ne l’évoque pas à la façon d’un air de musique humaine, qui, entendu par hasard à la belle saison, vous la rappelle ensuite ; elle est unie à l’été par un lien plus nécessaire : née des beaux jours, ne renaissant qu’avec eux, contenant un peu de leur essence, elle n’en réveille pas seulement l’image dans notre mémoire, elle en certifie le retour, la présence effective, ambiante, immédiatement accessible.","While the kitchen maid – involuntarily making Françoise's superiority shine, as Error, by contrast, makes the triumph of Truth more dazzling – was serving coffee which, according to Mama, was only hot water. , and then came up to our rooms with hot water which was barely lukewarm, I had stretched out on my bed, a book in my hand, in my room which, trembling, protected its transparent and fragile coolness against the summer sun. afternoon behind its almost closed shutters where a reflection of day had nevertheless found a way to pass its yellow wings, and remained motionless between the wood and the glazing, in a corner, like a seated butterfly. It was barely bright enough to read, and the sensation of the splendor of the light was given to me only by the knocks struck in the rue de la Cure by Camus (warned by Françoise that my aunt was not ""resting"" and that (one could make noise) against dusty boxes, but which, resounding in the sonorous atmosphere, special to hot weather, seemed to make scarlet stars fly away; and also by the flies which performed in front of me, in their little concert, like summer chamber music: it does not evoke it in the way of a tune of human music, which, heard by chance in the beautiful season, then reminds you of it; it is united to summer by a more necessary link: born of fine weather, reborn only with them, containing a little of their essence, it not only awakens its image in our memory, it certifies its return, the effective presence, ambient, immediately accessible.","While the kitchen maid—involuntarily causing Françoise’s superiority to shine forth, just as Error, by contrast, renders more dazzling the triumph of Truth—served coffee which according to Mama was merely hot water, and then took up to our rooms hot water which was barely lukewarm, I had lain down on my bed, a book in my hand, in my room which tremulously protected its frail transparent coolness from the afternoon sun behind its nearly closed shutters, through which a gleam of daylight had nonetheless contrived to pass its yellow wings, remaining motionless between the wood and the windowpane, in a corner, like a poised butterfly. It was barely light enough to read, and the sensation of the splendid brightness of the day came to me only from the blows struck in the rue de la Cure by Camus (told by Françoise that my aunt was “not resting” and that one could make noise) against some dusty crates, which, however, reverberating in the sonorous atmosphere peculiar to hot weather, seemed to send scarlet stars flying into the distance; and also by the houseflies that performed for me, in a little concert, a sort of chamber music of summer: this music does not evoke summer in the same way as a melody of human music, which, when you happen to hear it during the warm season, afterward reminds you of it; it is connected to the summer by a more necessary bond: born of the fine days, born again only with them, containing a little of their essence, it not only awakens their image in our memory, it guarantees their return, their presence, actual, ambient, immediately accessible.","Then while the kitchen-maid—who, all unawares, made the superior qualities of Françoise shine with added lustre, just as Error, by force of contrast, enhances the triumph of Truth—took in coffee which (according to Mamma) was nothing more than hot water, and then carried up to our rooms hot water which was barely tepid, I would be lying stretched out on my bed, a book in my hand, in my room which trembled with the effort to defend its frail, transparent coolness against the afternoon sun, behind its almost closed shutters through which, however, a reflection of the sunlight had contrived to slip in on its golden wings, remaining motionless, between glass and woodwork, in a corner, like a butterfly poised upon a flower. It was hardly light enough for me to read, and my feeling of the day's brightness and splendour was derived solely from the blows struck down below, in the Rue de la Curé, by Camus (whom Françoise had assured that my aunt was not 'resting' and that he might therefore make a noise), upon some old packing-cases from which nothing would really be sent flying but the dust, though the din of them, in the resonant atmosphere that accompanies hot weather, seemed to scatter broadcast a rain of blood-red stars; and from the flies who performed for my benefit, in their small concert, as it might be the chamber music of summer; evoking heat and light quite differently from an air of human music which, if you happen to have heard it during a fine summer, will always bring that summer back to your mind, the flies' music is bound to the season by a closer, a more vital tie—born of sunny days, and not to be reborn but with them, containing something of their essential nature, it not merely calls up their image in our memory, but gives us a guarantee that they do really exist, that they are close around us, immediately accessible."

"De ce poste élevé elle participait avec entrain à la conversation des fidèles et s’égayait de leurs « fumisteries », mais depuis l’accident qui était arrivé à sa mâchoire, elle avait renoncé à prendre la peine de pouffer effectivement et se livrait à la place à une mimique conventionnelle qui signifiait, sans fatigue ni risques pour elle, qu’elle riait aux larmes. Au moindre mot que lâchait un habitué contre un ennuyeux ou contre un ancien habitué rejeté au camp des ennuyeux – et pour le plus grand désespoir de M. Verdurin qui avait eu longtemps la prétention d’être aussi aimable que sa femme, mais qui riant pour de bon s’essoufflait vite et avait été distancé et vaincu par cette ruse d’une incessante et fictive hilarité – elle poussait un petit cri, fermait entièrement ses yeux d’oiseau qu’une taie commençait à voiler, et brusquement, comme si elle n’eût eu que le temps de cacher un spectacle indécent ou de parer à un accès mortel, plongeant sa figure dans ses mains qui la recouvraient et n’en laissaient plus rien voir, elle avait l’air de s’efforcer de réprimer, d’anéantir un rire qui, si elle s’y fût abandonnée, l’eût conduite à l’évanouissement. Telle, étourdie par la gaîté des fidèles, ivre de camaraderie, de médisance et d’assentiment, MmeVerdurin, juchée sur son perchoir, pareille à un oiseau dont on eût trempé le colifichet dans du vin chaud, sanglotait d’amabilité.","From this lofty post she participated with enthusiasm in the conversation of the faithful and was amused by their ""humbugs"", but since the accident which had happened to her jaw, she had given up taking the trouble to actually giggle and indulged in the place to a conventional mimicry which meant, without fatigue or risks for her, that she laughed until she cried. At the slightest word that a regular uttered against a bore or against a former regular rejected in the camp of the bores - and to the greatest despair of M. Verdurin who had long claimed to be as amiable as his wife, but who laughed for de bon quickly ran out of steam and had been outdistanced and defeated by this ruse of incessant and fictitious hilarity - she uttered a little cry, closed her bird's eyes completely, which a pillowcase was beginning to veil, and suddenly, as if she had only had time to hide an indecent spectacle or to ward off a mortal attack, plunging her face into her hands which covered it and left nothing to be seen, she seemed to be trying to repress, to annihilate a laugh which, if she had abandoned herself to it, would have driven her to fainting. Such, stunned by the gaiety of the faithful, drunk with camaraderie, slander and assent, Madame Verdurin, perched on her perch, like a bird whose trinket had been dipped in mulled wine, sobbed with kindness.","From this elevated spot she took energetic part in the conversation of the faithful and revelled in their practical jokes, but after the accident involving her jaw, she no longer took pains to explode in true laughter and performed instead a conventionalized pantomime that signified, without fatigue or risk for her, that she was laughing to the point of tears. At the mildest remark fired off by a regular against a bore or against a former regular who had been flung back into the camp of the bores—and to the greatest despair of M. Verdurin, who for a long time had had pretensions of being as affable as his wife, but who, when laughing in earnest, would soon get out of breath and so had been outdistanced and defeated by this ruse of incessant and fictive hilarity—she would utter a little cry, entirely close her birdlike eyes, which were slightly dimmed by leucoma, and abruptly, as if she had only just had time to avoid some indecent spectacle or avert a fatal blow, plunging her face in her hands, which covered it and allowed nothing of it to be seen, would appear to be doing her best to suppress, to annihilate a fit of laughter which , had she given way to it, would have caused her to faint. So, dazed by the gaiety of the faithful, drunk with good-fellowship, scandal-mongering, and approbation, Mme. Verdurin, poised on her perch, like a bird whose seedcake has been soaked in warm wine, sobbed with affability.","From this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the conversation of the 'faithful,' and would revel in all their fun; but, since the accident to her jaw, she had abandoned the effort involved in real hilarity, and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumb-show which signified, without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way, that she was 'laughing until she cried.' At the least witticism aimed by any of the circle against a 'bore,' or against a former member of the circle who was now relegated to the limbo of 'bores'—and to the utter despair of M. Verdurin, who had always made out that he was just as easily amused as his wife, but who, since his laughter was the 'real thing,' was out of breath in a moment, and so was overtaken and vanquished by her device of a feigned but continuous hilarity—she would utter a shrill cry, shut tight her little bird-like eyes, which were beginning to be clouded over by a cataract, and quickly, as though she had only just time to avoid some indecent sight or to parry a mortal blow, burying her face in her hands, which completely engulfed it, and prevented her from seeing anything at all, she would appear to be struggling to suppress, to eradicate a laugh which, were she to give way to it, must inevitably leave her inanimate. So, stupefied with the gaiety of the 'faithful,' drunken with comradeship, scandal and asseveration, Mme. Verdurin, perched on her high seat like a cage-bird whose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine, would sit aloft and sob with fellow-feeling."

"Elle n’était pas chez Prévost ; il voulut chercher dans tous les restaurants des boulevards. Pour gagner du temps, pendant qu’il visitait les uns, il envoya dans les autres son cocher Rémi (le doge Loredan de Rizzo) qu’il alla attendre ensuite – n’ayant rien trouvé lui-même – à l’endroit qu’il lui avait désigné. La voiture ne revenait pas et Swann se représentait le moment qui approchait, à la fois comme celui où Rémi lui dirait : « cette dame est là », et comme celui où Rémi lui dirait : « cette dame n’était dans aucun des cafés. » Et ainsi il voyait la fin de la soirée devant lui, une et pourtant alternative, précédée soit par la rencontre d’Odette qui abolirait son angoisse, soit par le renoncement forcé à la trouver ce soir, par l’acceptation de rentrer chez lui sans l’avoir vue.","She was not at Prévost; he wanted to look in all the restaurants on the boulevards. To save time, while he was visiting some, he sent his coachman Rémi (Rizzo's doge Loredan) to the others, whom he then went to wait for – having found nothing himself – at the place he he had appointed him. The car did not come back and Swann imagined the moment approaching, both as when Rémi would say to him: “that lady is there,” and as when Rémi would say to him: “that lady was not in any of the cafes. And so he saw the end of the evening before him, one and yet alternative, preceded either by the meeting of Odette who would abolish his anguish, or by the forced renunciation of finding her this evening, by the acceptance of returning home. without seeing her.","She was not at Prévost’s; he wanted to look in every restaurant along the boulevards. In order to gain time, while he visited some he sent into the others his coachman Rémi (the Doge Loredano by Rizzo), for whom he then waited—having found nothing himself—at a place he had specified to him. The carriage did not return and Swann pictured to himself the approaching moment, as both the moment in which Rémi would say to him: “The lady is here,” and the moment in which Rémi would say to him: “The lady was not in any of the cafés.” And so he saw the end of the evening before him, one single outcome and yet an alternative as well, preceded either by a meeting with Odette which would put an end to his agony, or by a forced renunciation of finding her this evening, an acceptance of returning home without having seen her.","She was not at Prevost's; he must search for her, then, in every restaurant upon the boulevards. To save time, while he went in one direction, he sent in the other his coachman Rémi (Rizzo's Doge Loredan) for whom he presently—after a fruitless search—found himself waiting at the spot where the carriage was to meet him. It did not appear, and Swann tantalised himself with alternate pictures of the approaching moment, as one in which Rémi would say to him: ""Sir, the lady is there,"" or as one in which Rémi would say to him: ""Sir, the lady was not in any of the cafés."" And so he saw himself faced by the close of his evening—a thing uniform, and yet bifurcated by the intervening accident which would either put an end to his agony by discovering Odette, or would oblige him to abandon any hope of finding her that night, to accept the necessity of returning home without having seen her."
"– Mais ce pourrait être un parent, reprit Swann, cela serait assez triste, mais enfin un homme de génie peut être le cousin d’une vieille bête. Si cela était, j’avoue qu’il n’y a pas de supplice que je ne m’imposerais pour que la vieille bête me présentât à l’auteur de la sonate : d’abord le supplice de fréquenter la vieille bête, et qui doit être affreux.","“But it could be a relative,” resumed Swann, “that would be sad enough, but after all a man of genius can be the cousin of an old beast. If that were so, I confess that there is no torture that I would not impose on myself so that the old beast introduced me to the author of the sonata: first the torture of frequenting the old beast, and which must be awful.","“But he could be a relative,” Swann went on. “That would be rather sad, but the fact is, a man of genius can be cousin to an old fool. If this is so, I confess I would submit to any kind of torture to get the old fool to introduce me to the composer of that sonata: starting with the torture of associating with the old fool, which would be frightful.”","""But it may well be some relative,"" Swann went on. ""That would be bad enough; but, after all, there is no reason why a genius shouldn't have a cousin who is a silly old fool. And if that should be so, I swear there's no known or unknown form of torture I wouldn't undergo to get the old fool to introduce me to the man who composed the sonata; starting with the torture of the old fool's company, which would be ghastly."""
"Quand enfin Swann présenta M. de Froberville à la jeune Mme de Cambremer, comme c’était la première fois qu’elle entendait le nom du général, elle esquissa le sourire de joie et de surprise qu’elle aurait eu si on n’en avait jamais prononcé devant elle d’autre que celui-là, car ne connaissant pas les amis de sa nouvelle famille, à chaque personne qu’on lui amenait, elle croyait que c’était l’un d’eux, et pensant qu’elle faisait preuve de tact en ayant l’air d’en avoir tant entendu parler depuis qu’elle était mariée, elle tendait la main d’un air hésitant destiné à prouver la réserve apprise qu’elle avait à vaincre et la sympathie spontanée qui réussissait à en triompher. Aussi ses beaux-parents, qu’elle croyait encore les gens les plus brillants de France, déclaraient-ils qu’elle était un ange ; d’autant plus qu’ils préféraient paraître, en la faisant épouser à leur fils, avoir cédé à l’attrait plutôt de ses qualités que de sa grande fortune.","When at last Swann introduced M. de Froberville to the young Mme. had never spoken in front of her other than that, because not knowing the friends of her new family, to each person brought to her, she believed that it was one of them, and thinking that she was tactful in looking as though she had heard so much about it since she was married, holding out her hand with a hesitant air meant to prove the learned reserve she had to overcome and the spontaneous sympathy which succeeded in overcoming it. Also her parents-in-law, whom she still believed to be the most brilliant people in France, declared that she was an angel; all the more so since they preferred to appear, by marrying her to their son, to have yielded to the attraction rather of her qualities than of her great fortune.","When at last Swann introduced M. de Froberville to young Mme. de Cambremer, since it was the first time she had heard the general’s name she ventured the smile of joy and surprise she would have given him if no other name but that one had ever been uttered in her presence, for as she did not know the friends of her new family, each time a person was presented to her, she believed he was one of them, and thinking it would be tactful of her to look as though she had heard such a lot about him since she was married, she would put out her hand with a hesitant air meant as proof of the inculcated reserve she had to conquer and the spontaneous congeniality that succeeded in overcoming it. And so her parents-in-law, whom she still believed to be the most brilliant people in France, declared that she was an angel; especially since they preferred to appear, in marrying their son to her, to have responded to the attraction of her fine qualities rather than of her great wealth.","When Swann did finally introduce M. de Froberville to the young Mme. de Cambremer, since it was the first time that she had heard the General's name, she hastily outlined upon her lips the smile of joy and surprise with which she would have greeted him if she had never, in the whole of her life, heard anything else; for, as she did not yet know all the friends of her new family, whenever anyone was presented to her, she assumed that he must be one of them, and thinking that she would shew her tact by appearing to have heard 'such a lot about him' since her marriage, she would hold out her hand with an air of hesitation which was meant as a proof at once of the inculcated reserve which she had to overcome and of the spontaneous friendliness which successfully overcame it. And so her parents-in-law, whom she still regarded as the most eminent pair in France, declared that she was an angel; all the more that they preferred to appear, in marrying her to their son, to have yielded to the attraction rather of her natural charm than of her considerable fortune."
Il monta avec elle dans la voiture qu’elle avait et dit à la sienne de suivre.,He got into the car she had with her and told his to follow.,"He stepped up with her into the carriage that she had waiting there, and told his own to follow.","He climbed after her into the carriage which she had kept waiting, and ordered his own to follow."
"Mais, par les intimités déjà anciennes qu’il avait parmi eux, les gens du monde, dans une certaine mesure, faisaient aussi partie de sa maison, de son domestique et de sa famille. Il se sentait, à considérer ses brillantes amitiés, le même appui hors de lui-même, le même confort, qu’à regarder les belles terres, la belle argenterie, le beau linge de table, qui lui venaient des siens. Et la pensée que s’il tombait chez lui frappé d’une attaque, ce serait tout naturellement le duc de Chartres, le prince de Reuss, le duc de Luxembourg, et le baron de Charlus, que son valet de chambre courrait chercher, lui apportait la même consolation qu’à notre vieille Françoise de savoir qu’elle serait ensevelie dans des draps fins à elle, marqués, non reprisés (ou si finement que cela ne donnait qu’une plus haute idée du soin de l’ouvrière), linceul de l’image fréquente duquel elle tirait une certaine satisfaction, sinon de bien-être, au moins d’amour-propre. Mais surtout, comme dans toutes celles de ses actions et de ses pensées qui se rapportaient à Odette, Swann était constamment dominé et dirigé par le sentiment inavoué qu’il lui était peut-être pas moins cher, mais moins agréable à voir que quiconque, que le plus ennuyeux fidèle des Verdurin, quand il se reportait à un monde pour qui il était l’homme exquis par excellence, qu’on faisait tout pour attirer, qu’on se désolait de ne pas voir, il recommençait à croire à l’existence d’une vie plus heureuse, presque à en éprouver l’appétit, comme il arrive à un malade alité depuis des mois, à la diète, et qui aperçoit dans un journal le menu d’un déjeuner officiel ou l’annonce d’une croisière en Sicile.","But, by the already old intimacies he had among them, the people of the world, to a certain extent, were also part of his house, his servant and his family. He felt, in considering his brilliant friendships, the same support outside of himself, the same comfort, as in looking at the beautiful lands, the beautiful silverware, the beautiful table linen, which came to him from his family. And the thought that if he came home stricken with a stroke, it would quite naturally be the Duc de Chartres, the Prince de Reuss, the Duc de Luxembourg, and the Baron de Charlus, whom his valet would run to fetch, brought the same consolation as to our old Françoise to know that she would be buried in her own fine sheets, marked, not darned (or so finely that it only gave a higher idea of the worker's care), shroud from the frequent image from which she derived a certain satisfaction, if not from well-being, at least from self-love. But above all, as in all of his actions and thoughts which related to Odette, Swann was constantly dominated and directed by the unacknowledged feeling that he was perhaps not less dear to her, but less pleasant to see than anyone else, that the most boring faithful of the Verdurins, when he referred to a world for which he was the exquisite man par excellence, whom they did everything to attract, who were sorry not to see, he began to believe in the existence of a happier life, almost enough to make you crave for it, as happens to a patient who has been bedridden for months, on a diet, and who sees in a newspaper the menu of an official luncheon or the announcement of a a cruise in Sicily.","But, because of the long-standing close ties he had among them, the nobility, to a certain extent, were also part of his house, his household, and his family. He felt he possessed, when contemplating his distinguished friendships, the same support from outside, the same comfort, as when looking at the fine lands, the fine silverware, the fine table linen, that had come to him from his own people. And the thought that if he were to collapse at home from the effects of a sudden illness it would quite naturally be the Duc de Chartres, the Prince de Reuss, the Duc de Luxembourg, and the Baron de Charlus whom his valet would run off to find, brought him the same consolation as to our old Françoise the knowledge that she would be wrapped in a shroud of her own fine sheets, marked, not mended (or so finely that it gave only a loftier idea of the care of the seamstress), a shroud from the frequent image of which in her mind’s eye she derived a certain satisfying sense, if not of material well-being, at least of self-respect. But most important, since in every one of his actions and thoughts that referred to Odette, Swann was constantly governed and directed by the unavowed feeling that he was, perhaps not less dear, but less welcome to her than anyone else, than the most boring faithful of the Verdurins—when he returned to a world in which he was the highest example of excellence, whom one would do anything to attract, whom one was sorry not to see, he began to believe again in the existence of a happier life, almost to feel an appetite for it, as an invalid may feel who has been bedridden for months, on a strict diet, and who sees in a newspaper the menu for an official luncheon or an advertisement for a cruise to Sicily.","But, by virtue of his intimacy, already time-honoured, with so many of them, the people of fashion, in a certain sense, were also a part of his house, his service, and his family. He felt, when his mind dwelt upon his brilliant connections, the same external support, the same solid comfort as when he looked at the fine estate, the fine silver, the fine table-linen which had come down to him from his forebears. And the thought that, if he were seized by a sudden illness and confined to the house, the people whom his valet would instinctively run to find would be the Duc de Chartres, the Prince de Reuss, the Duc de Luxembourg and the Baron de Charlus, brought him the same consolation as our old Françoise derived from the knowledge that she would, one day, be buried in her own fine clothes, marked with her name, not darned at all (or so exquisitely darned that it merely enhanced one's idea of the skill and patience of the seamstress), a shroud from the constant image of which in her mind's eye she drew a certain satisfactory sense, if not actually of wealth and prosperity, at any rate of self-esteem. But most of all,—since in every one of his actions and thoughts which had reference to Odette, Swann was constantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed feeling that he was, perhaps not less dear, but at least less welcome to her than anyone, even the most wearisome of the Verdurins' 'faithful,'—when he betook himself to a world in which he was the paramount example of taste, a man whom no pains were spared to attract, whom people were genuinely sorry not to see, he began once again to believe in the existence of a happier life, almost to feel an appetite for it, as an invalid may feel who has been in bed for months and on a strict diet, when he picks up a newspaper and reads the account of an official banquet or the advertisement of a cruise round Sicily."
"MlleVinteuil frémit et se leva. Son cœur scrupuleux et sensible ignorait quelles paroles devaient spontanément venir s’adapter à la scène que ses sens réclamaient. Elle cherchait le plus loin qu’elle pouvait de sa vraie nature morale, à trouver le langage propre à la fille vicieuse qu’elle désirait d’être, mais les mots qu’elle pensait que celle-ci eût prononcés sincèrement lui paraissaient faux dans sa bouche. Et le peu qu’elle s’en permettait était dit sur un ton guindé où ses habitudes de timidité paralysaient ses velléités d’audace, et s’entremêlait de : « Tu n’as pas froid, tu n’as pas trop chaud, tu n’as pas envie d’être seule et de lire ? »","Mademoiselle Vinteuil shuddered and got up. His scrupulous and sensitive heart did not know which words had to come spontaneously to adapt to the scene that his senses demanded. She sought as far as she could from her true moral nature, to find the proper language for the vicious girl she wanted to be, but the words she thought she had uttered sincerely seemed false to her in his mouth. And the little she allowed herself was said in a stiff tone in which her habits of shyness paralyzed her daring inclinations, and was intertwined with: ""You're not cold, you're not too hot, don't you want to be alone and read? »","Mlle. Vinteuil shuddered and stood up. Her scrupulous and sensitive heart did not know what words ought to come to her spontaneously to suit the scene that her senses demanded.

And the little she allowed herself to say was said in a stiff tone of voice in which her habitual shyness paralyzed her inclinations toward boldness, and was interlarded with: “You’re not too cold, are you, you’re not too warm, would you rather be alone and read?”","Mlle. Vinteuil shuddered and rose to her feet. In her sensitive and scrupulous heart she was ignorant what words ought to flow, spontaneously, from her lips, so as to produce the scene for which her eager senses clamoured. She reached out as far as she could across the limitations of her true character to find the language appropriate to a vicious young woman such as she longed to be thought, but the words which, she imagined, such a young woman might have uttered with sincerity sounded unreal in her own mouth. And what little she allowed herself to say was said in a strained tone, in which her ingrained timidity paralysed her tendency to freedom and audacity of speech; while she kept on interrupting herself with: ""You're sure you aren't cold? You aren't too hot? You don't want to sit and read by yourself?..."
"Ne lui auraient-elles pas fourni, dans ce qu’elles contenaient de la vie d’Odette, le seul calmant efficace pour ses souffrances ? Comme il aurait couru avec joie passer les journées chez telle de ces petites gens avec lesquelles Odette gardait des relations, soit par intérêt, soit par simplicité véritable. Comme il eût volontiers élu domicile à jamais au cinquième étage de telle maison sordide et enviée où Odette ne l’emmenait pas, et où, s’il y avait habité avec la petite couturière retirée dont il eût volontiers fait semblant d’être l’amant, il aurait presque chaque jour reçu sa visite. Dans ces quartiers presque populaires, quelle existence modeste, abjecte, mais douce, mais nourrie de calme et de bonheur, il eût accepté de vivre indéfiniment.","Wouldn't they have provided him, in what they contained of Odette's life, with the only effective tranquilizer for his sufferings? How he would have run with joy to spend the days with one of those little people with whom Odette kept up relations, either out of interest or out of genuine simplicity. As he would gladly have taken up residence forever on the fifth floor of some sordid and envied house where Odette did not take him, and where, if he had lived there with the little retired seamstress whom he would gladly have pretended to be lover, he would have received her visit almost every day. In these almost working-class neighborhoods, what a modest existence, abject, but sweet, but nourished with calm and happiness, he would have accepted to live indefinitely.","Wouldn’t she have given him, with what she contained of Odette’s life, the only effective calmative for his pain? How happily he would have hurried to spend the days at the home of one of those humble people with whom Odette kept up friendly relations out of either self-interest or true simplicity! How willingly he would have taken up residence forever on the fifth floor of a certain sordid and coveted house to which Odette did not take him and in which, if he had lived there with the little retired dressmaker whose lover he would willingly have pretended to be, he would have had a visit from her almost every day! In these almost working-class neighborhoods, what a modest life, abject, but sweet, nourished with calm and happiness, he would have agreed to live indefinitely!","Would they not have supplied him, out of what was contained in their knowledge of the life of Odette, with the one potent anodyne for his pain? With what joy would he have hastened to spend his days with one or other of those humble folk with whom Odette kept up friendly relations, either with some ulterior motive or from genuine simplicity of nature. How willingly would he have fixed his abode for ever in the attics of some sordid but enviable house, where Odette went but never took him, and where, if he had lived with the little retired dressmaker, whose lover he would readily have pretended to be, he would have been visited by. Odette almost daily. In those regions, that were almost slums, what a modest existence, abject, if you please, but delightful, nourished by tranquillity and happiness, he would have consented to lead indefinitely."
"Maintenant, tous les soirs, quand il l’avait ramenée chez elle, il fallait qu’il entrât et souvent elle ressortait en robe de chambre et le conduisait jusqu’à sa voiture, l’embrassait aux yeux du cocher, disant : « Qu’est-ce que cela peut me faire, que me font les autres ? » Les soirs où il n’allait pas chez les Verdurin (ce qui arrivait parfois depuis qu’il pouvait la voir autrement), les soirs de plus en plus rares où il allait dans le monde, elle lui demandait de venir chez elle avant de rentrer, quelque heure qu’il fût. C’était le printemps, un printemps pur et glacé. En sortant de soirée, il montait dans sa victoria, étendait une couverture sur ses jambes, répondait aux amis qui s’en allaient en même temps que lui et lui demandaient de revenir avec eux qu’il ne pouvait pas, qu’il n’allait pas du même côté, et le cocher partait au grand trot sachant où on allait. Eux s’étonnaient, et de fait, Swann n’était plus le même. On ne recevait plus jamais de lettre de lui où il demandât à connaître une femme. Il ne faisait plus attention à aucune, s’abstenait d’aller dans les endroits où on en rencontre. Dans un restaurant, à la campagne, il avait l’attitude inverse de celle à quoi, hier encore, on l’eût reconnu et qui avait semblé devoir toujours être la sienne. Tant une passion est en nous comme un caractère momentané et différent qui se substitue à l’autre et abolit les signes jusque-là invariables par lesquels il s’exprimait ! En revanche ce qui était invariable maintenant, c’était que où que Swann se trouvât, il ne manquât pas d’aller rejoindre Odette. Le trajet qui le séparait d’elle était celui qu’il parcourait inévitablement et comme la pente même, irrésistible et rapide, de sa vie. À vrai dire, souvent resté tard dans le monde, il aurait mieux aimé rentrer directement chez lui sans faire cette longue course et ne la voir que le lendemain ; mais le fait même de se déranger à une heure anormale pour aller chez elle, de deviner que les amis qui le quittaient se disaient : « Il est très tenu, il y a certainement une femme qui le force à aller chez elle à n’importe quelle heure », lui faisait sentir qu’il menait la vie des hommes qui ont une affaire amoureuse dans leur existence, et en qui le sacrifice qu’ils font de leur repos et de leurs intérêts à une rêverie voluptueuse fait naître un charme intérieur. Puis sans qu’il s’en rendît compte, cette certitude qu’elle l’attendait, qu’elle n’était pas ailleurs avec d’autres, qu’il ne reviendrait pas sans l’avoir vue, neutralisait cette angoisse oubliée, mais toujours prête à renaître, qu’il avait éprouvée le soir où Odette n’était plus chez les Verdurin, et dont l’apaisement actuel était si doux que cela pouvait s’appeler du bonheur. Peut-être était-ce à cette angoisse qu’il était redevable de l’importance qu’Odette avait prise pour lui. Les êtres nous sont d’habitude si indifférents, que quand nous avons mis dans l’un d’eux de telles possibilités de souffrance et de joie, pour nous il nous semble appartenir à un autre univers, il s’entoure de poésie, il fait de notre vie comme une étendue émouvante où il sera plus ou moins rapproché de nous. Swann ne pouvait se demander sans trouble ce qu’Odette deviendrait pour lui dans les années qui allaient venir.","Now, every evening, when he had brought her home, he had to come in, and often she would come out in her dressing gown and lead him to her carriage, kiss him in the eyes of the coachman, saying: can this do to me, what do others do to me? The evenings when he did not go to the Verdurins' (which sometimes happened since he could see her differently), the increasingly rare evenings when he went out into society, she asked him to come to her house before leaving. to return, whatever time it was. It was spring, a pure and icy spring. Coming out of the evening, he got into his Victoria, spread a blanket over his legs, answered the friends who were leaving at the same time as him and asked him to come back with them that he couldn't, that he couldn't. not going in the same direction, and the coachman set off at a brisk trot knowing where we were going. They were surprised, and in fact, Swann was no longer the same. We never again received a letter from him asking to meet a woman. He no longer paid any attention to any, refrained from going to places where one met them. In a restaurant in the country, he had the opposite attitude to that by which, only yesterday, one would have recognized him and which had always seemed to be his. So much is one passion in us like a momentary and different character which replaces the other and abolishes the hitherto invariable signs by which it expressed itself! On the other hand, what was invariable now was that wherever Swann was, he would not fail to join Odette. The path that separated him from her was the one he inevitably traveled and like the very slope, irresistible and rapid, of his life. To tell the truth, often staying late in the world, he would have preferred to go directly home without making this long journey and not seeing her until the next day; but the very fact of getting out of his way at an abnormal hour to go to her house, of guessing that the friends who were leaving him said to themselves: ""He is very strict, there is certainly a woman who forces him to go to her house at any time."" what time,” made him feel that he was leading the life of men who have an amorous affair in their lives, and in whom the sacrifice they make of their rest and their interests to a voluptuous reverie gives birth to an inner charm. Then, without his realizing it, this certainty that she was waiting for him, that she was not elsewhere with others, that he would not return without having seen her, neutralized this forgotten anguish, but always ready to be reborn, which he had experienced on the evening when Odette was no longer with the Verdurins, and whose present relief was so sweet that it could be called happiness. Perhaps it was to this anguish that he was indebted for the importance that Odette had assumed for him. The beings are usually so indifferent to us, that when we put in one of them such possibilities of suffering and joy, for us it seems to us to belong to another universe, it surrounds itself with poetry, it makes our life like a moving expanse where he will be more or less close to us. Swann could not wonder without difficulty what Odette would become for him in the years to come.","Now, every evening, when he took her home, he had to go in, and often she came back out in a dressing gown and led him to his carriage, kissed him within view of the coachman, saying: “What difference does it make to me, what other people think of me?” On evenings when he did not go to the Verdurins’ (which happened sometimes now that he had another way of seeing her), on the increasingly rare evenings when he went into society, she would ask him to come to see her on his way home, whatever the hour. It was spring, a clear and icy spring. Coming out of a party, he would get into his victoria, spread a rug over his legs, tell the friends who were going off at the same time and who had asked him to join them that he could not, that he was not going in the same direction, and the coachman would leave at a fast trot knowing where to go. They would be amazed, and, in fact, Swann was no longer the same. No one ever received a letter from him now asking for an introduction to some woman. He no longer paid any attention to women, avoided going to places where one might meet them. In a restaurant, in the country, his attitude was the opposite of the one by which, just recently, he could be recognized and which had seemed to have been his always. To such an extent does a passion manifest itself in us as a temporary and distinct character that replaces our other character and eliminates the signs, invariable until then, by which it was expressed! Now, however, what was invariable was that, wherever Swann might be, he did not fail to go to meet Odette. The path that separated him from her was the one he inevitably traveled as though it were the slope itself, rapid and irresistible, of his life. In truth, when he had stayed out late, he would often have preferred to go directly home without making that long trip, and not see her until the next day; but the very fact of taking the trouble to go to her house at an unusual hour, of guessing that the friends who were leaving him were saying to themselves: “He is tied hand and foot, some woman must be insisting that he go to her whatever the hour,” made him feel he was leading the life of men known to be having a love affair and in whom the sacrifice they are making of their sleep and their other interests to a dream of sensuous pleasure produces an inner charm. Then again, without his realizing it, the certainty that she was waiting for him, that she was not somewhere else with other people, that he would not return without seeing her, neutralized the anguish, forgotten but always ready to be reawakened, which he had felt the night when Odette was not at the Verdurins’, and of which the present assuagement was so sweet that it could be named happiness. Perhaps it was to this anguish that he owed the importance which Odette had now assumed for him. Other people usually leave us so indifferent that when we have invested in one of them such possibilities of causing us pain and joy, that person seems to belong to another universe, is surrounded with poetry, turns our life into a sort of expanse of emotion in which that person will be more or less close to us. Swann could not ask himself without anxiety what Odette would mean to him in the years to come.","The ice once broken, every evening, when he had taken her home, he must follow her into the house; and often she would come out again in her dressing-gown, and escort him to his carriage, and would kiss him before the eyes of his coachman, saying: ""What on earth does it matter what people see?"" And on evenings when he did not go to the Verdurins' (which happened occasionally, now that he had opportunities of meeting Odette elsewhere), when—more and more rarely—he went into society, she would beg him to come to her on his way home, however late he might be. The season was spring, the nights clear and frosty. He would come away from an evening party, jump into his victoria, spread a rug over his knees, tell the friends who were leaving at the same time, and who insisted on his going home with them, that he could not, that he was not going in their direction; then the coachman would start off at a fast trot without further orders, knowing quite well where he had to go. His friends would be left marvelling, and, as a matter of fact, Swann was no longer the same man. No one ever received a letter from him now demanding an introduction to a woman. He had ceased to pay any attention to women, and kept away from the places in which they were ordinarily to be met. In a restaurant, or in the country, his manner was deliberately and directly the opposite of that by which, only a few days earlier, his friends would have recognised him, that manner which had seemed permanently and unalterably his own. To such an extent does passion manifest itself in us as a temporary and distinct character, which not only takes the place of our normal character but actually obliterates the signs by which that character has hitherto been discernible. On the other hand, there was one thing that was, now, invariable, namely that wherever Swann might be spending the evening, he never failed to go on afterwards to Odette. The interval of space separating her from him was one which he must as inevitably traverse as he must descend, by an irresistible gravitation, the steep slope of life itself. To be frank, as often as not, when he had stayed late at a party, he would have preferred to return home at once, without going so far out of his way, and to postpone their meeting until the morrow; but the very fact of his putting himself to such inconvenience at an abnormal hour in order to visit her, while he guessed that his friends, as he left them, were saying to one another: ""He is tied hand and foot; there must certainly be a woman somewhere who insists on his going to her at all hours,"" made him feel that he was leading the life of the class of men whose existence is coloured by a love-affair, and in whom the perpetual sacrifice which they are making of their comfort and of their practical interests has engendered a spiritual charm. Then, though he may not consciously have taken this into consideration, the certainty that she was waiting for him, that she was not anywhere or with anyone else, that he would see her before he went home, drew the sting from that anguish, forgotten, it is true, but latent and ever ready to be reawakened, which he had felt on the evening when Odette had left the Verdurins' before his arrival, an anguish the actual cessation of which was so agreeable that it might even be called a state of happiness. Perhaps it was to that hour of anguish that there must be attributed the importance which Odette had since assumed in his life. Other people are, as a rule, so immaterial to us that, when we have entrusted to any one of them the power to cause so much suffering or happiness to ourselves, that person seems at once to belong to a different universe, is surrounded with poetry, makes of our lives a vast expanse, quick with sensation, on which that person and ourselves are ever more or less in contact. Swann could not without anxiety ask himself what Odette would mean to him in the years that were to come."

"Dieu m’est témoin que j’ai sincèrement voulu tirer Odette de là, et l’élever dans une atmosphère plus noble et plus pure.

"– Ces de La Trémouaille que MmeVerdurin nous a montrés comme si peu recommandables, demanda Brichot, en articulant avec force, descendent-ils de ceux que cette bonne snob de Mme de Sévigné avouait être heureuse de connaître parce que cela faisait bien pour ses paysans ? Il est vrai que la marquise avait une autre raison, et qui pour elle devait primer celle-là, car gendelettre dans l’âme, elle faisait passer la copie avant tout. Or dans le journal qu’elle envoyait régulièrement à sa fille, c’est Mme de la Trémouaille, bien documentée par ses grandes alliances, qui faisait la politique étrangère.","“Those de La Trémouaille whom Madame Verdurin showed us to be so disreputable,” asked Brichot, articulating forcefully, “are they descended from those whom that good snob Madame de Sévigné confessed to being happy to know because it was good for her peasants?

True, the Marquise had another reason, which in her case probably came first, for she was a thorough journalist at heart, and always on the look-out for 'copy.'

"– Mais non, répondit M. de Forcheville et comme pour se rapprocher plus aisément d’Odette, il désirait être agréable à Swann, voulant saisir cette occasion, pour le flatter, de parler de ses belles relations, mais d’en parler en homme du monde sur un ton de critique cordiale et n’avoir pas l’air de l’en féliciter comme d’un succès inespéré : « N’est-ce pas, Swann ? je ne vous vois jamais. D’ailleurs, comment faire pour le voir ? Cet animal-là est tout le temps fourré chez les La Trémoïlle, chez les Laumes, chez tout ça !… » Imputation d’autant plus fausse d’ailleurs que depuis un an Swann n’allait plus guère que chez les Verdurin. Mais le seul nom de personnes qu’ils ne connaissaient pas était accueilli chez eux par un silence réprobateur. M. Verdurin, craignant la pénible impression que ces noms d’« ennuyeux », surtout lancés ainsi sans tact à la face de tous les fidèles, avaient dû produire sur sa femme, jeta sur elle à la dérobée un regard plein d’inquiète sollicitude. Il vit alors que dans sa résolution de ne pas prendre acte, de ne pas avoir été touchée par la nouvelle qui venait de lui être notifiée, de ne pas seulement rester muette, mais d’avoir été sourde comme nous l’affectons quand un ami fautif essaye de glisser dans la conversation une excuse que ce serait avoir l’air d’admettre que de l’avoir écoutée sans protester, ou quand on prononce devant nous le nom défendu d’un ingrat, MmeVerdurin pour que son silence n’eût pas l’air d’un consentement, mais du silence ignorant des choses inanimées, avait soudain dépouillé son visage de toute vie, de toute motilité ; son front bombé n’était plus qu’une belle étude de ronde bosse où le nom de ces La Trémoïlle, chez qui était toujours fourré Swann, n’avait pu pénétrer ; son nez légèrement froncé laissait voir une échancrure qui semblait calquée sur la vie. On eût dit que sa bouche entr’ouverte allait parler. Ce n’était plus qu’une cire perdue, qu’un masque de plâtre, qu’une maquette pour un monument, qu’un buste pour le Palais de l’Industrie, devant lequel le public s’arrêterait certainement pour admirer comment le sculpteur, en exprimant l’imprescriptible dignité des Verdurin opposée à celle des La Trémoïlle et des Laumes qu’ils valent certes ainsi que tous les ennuyeux de la terre, était arrivé à donner une majesté presque papale à la blancheur et à la rigidité de la pierre. Mais le marbre finit par s’animer et fit entendre qu’il fallait ne pas être dégoûté pour aller chez ces gens-là, car la femme était toujours ivre et le mari si ignorant qu’il disait collidor pour corridor.","“No,” replied M. de Forcheville, and as if to get closer to Odette more easily, he wanted to please Swann, wanting to seize this opportunity, to flatter him, to talk about his good relations, but to talk about them like a man. of the world in a tone of cordial criticism and without seeming to congratulate him on it as an unexpected success: ""Isn't it, Swann? I never see you. Besides, how do you see it? This animal is always stuffed with the La Trémoïlles, the Laumes, with all that!...” Imputation all the more false, moreover, since for a year Swann hardly went anywhere except at the Verdurins. But the mere names of people they didn't know were greeted in their homes with a reproving silence. M. Verdurin, fearing the painful impression that these names of ""boring"", especially thrown thus without tact in the face of all the faithful, must have produced on his wife, cast on her secretly a look full of anxious solicitude. . He saw then that in his resolution not to take note, not to have been touched by the news which had just been notified to him, not only to remain silent, but to have been deaf as we affect when a friend at fault tries to slip into the conversation an excuse that it would be seeming to admit only to have listened to it without protesting, or when we pronounce in front of us the forbidden name of an ingrate, Madame Verdurin, so that her silence would not have not the air of consent, but of the ignorant silence of inanimate things, had suddenly stripped his face of all life, of all motility; his domed forehead was now no more than a beautiful study in the round, into which the name of those La Trémoïlles, with whom Swann was always stuffed, had not been able to penetrate; her slightly wrinkled nose revealed an indentation that seemed modeled on life. One would have said that his half-open mouth was about to speak. It was nothing more than a lost wax, a plaster mask, a model for a monument, a bust for the Palais de l'Industrie, in front of which the public would certainly stop to admire how the sculptor, by expressing the imprescriptible dignity of the Verdurins opposed to that of the La Trémoïlle and the Laumes which they are certainly worth as well as all the boring people of the earth, had succeeded in giving an almost papal majesty to the whiteness and the rigidity of the rock. But the marble ended by becoming animated and made it understood that one must not be disgusted to go to these people, for the wife was always drunk and the husband so ignorant that he said collidor for corridor.","“Oh no,” answered M. de Forcheville, and since in order to approach Odette more easily he wanted to be pleasant to Swann, he attempted to seize this opportunity of flattering him by talking about his distinguished friends, but talking about them as a man of the world, in the tone of an affectionate critic and not as though he were congratulating him as on an unhoped-for success : “Isn’t it so, Swann? I never see you. Anyway, how could I ever see him? The man is always hanging about with the La Trémoïlles,57 with the Laumes, people like that! . . .” An imputation especially false, since, for a year now, Swann had hardly gone anywhere but to the Verdurins’. But the mere name of a person they did not know was greeted by a reproving silence on their part. M. Verdurin, afraid of the painful impression that these names of “bores,” especially when tactlessly hurled thus in the faces of all the faithful, must have produced on his wife, secretly cast at her a glance full of worried solicitude. He saw then that in her resolution not to take action, not to have been affected by the news that had just been announced to her, not merely to remain dumb but to have been deaf as well, the way we pretend to be deaf when a friend who has offended us tries to slip into the conversation an excuse which we would seem to accept if we listened to it without protesting, or when someone utters in our presence the forbidden name of an ingrate, Mme. Verdurin, so that her silence would not seem to be a form of consent, but rather the ignorant silence of an inanimate object, had suddenly divested her face of all life, all mobility; her prominent forehead was now merely a lovely study in the round, which the name of those La Trémoïlles at whose house Swann was always hanging about had not been able to penetrate; her slightly wrinkled nose revealed an indentation that seemed copied from life. Her half-open mouth seemed about to speak. She was now merely a lost wax,58 a plaster mask, a model for a monument, a bust for the Palais de l’Industrie59 in front of which the public would certainly stop to admire how the sculptor, by expressing the indefeasible dignity of the Verdurins as opposed to that of the La Trémoïlles and the Laumes, whose equals they naturally were, as they were the equals of all the bores on earth, had managed to give an almost papal majesty to the whiteness and rigidity of the stone. But at last the marble came to life and insinuated that one could not be squeamish if one wanted to go to the homes of these people, because the wife was always drunk and the husband so ignorant that he said “collidor” instead of “corridor.”","""Oh dear, no!"" he answered, and then, thinking that if he made himself pleasant to Swann he might find favour with Odette, he decided to take this opportunity of flattering him by speaking of his fashionable friends, but speaking as a man of the world himself, in a tone of good-natured criticism, and not as though he were congratulating Swann upon some undeserved good fortune: ""Isn't that so, Swann? I never see anything of you, do I?—But then, where on earth is one to see him? The creature spends all his time shut up with the La Trémoïlles, with the Laumes and all that lot!"" The imputation would have been false at any time, and was all the more so , now that for at least a year Swann had given up going to almost any house but the Verdurins'. But the mere names of families whom the Verdurins did not know were received by them in a reproachful silence. M. Verdurin, dreading the painful impression which the mention of these 'bores,' especially when flung at her in this tactless fashion, and in front of all the 'faithful,' was bound to make on his wife, cast a covert glance at her, instinct with anxious solicitude. He saw then that in her fixed resolution to take no notice, to have escaped contact, altogether, with the news which had just been addressed to her, not merely to remain dumb but to have been deaf as well, as we pretend to be when a friend who has been in the wrong attempts to slip into his conversation some excuse which we should appear to be accepting, should we appear to have heard it without protesting, or when some one utters the name of an enemy, the very mention of whom in our presence is forbidden; Mme. Verdurin, so that her silence should have the appearance, not of consent but of the unconscious silence which inanimate objects preserve, had suddenly emptied her face of all life, of all mobility; her rounded forehead was nothing, now, but an exquisite study in high relief, which the name of those La Trémoïlles, with whom Swann was always 'shut up,' had failed to penetrate; her nose, just perceptibly wrinkled in a frown, exposed to view two dark cavities that were, surely, modelled from life. You would have said that her half-opened lips were just about to speak. It was all no more, however, than a wax cast, a mask in plaster, the sculptor's design for a monument, a bust to be exhibited in the Palace of Industry, where the public would most certainly gather in front of it and marvel to see how the sculptor, in expressing the unchallengeable dignity of the Verdurins, as opposed to that of the La Trémoïlles or Laumes, whose equals (if not, indeed, their betters) they were, and the equals and betters of all other 'bores' upon the face of the earth, had managed to invest with a majesty that was almost Papal the whiteness and rigidity of his stone. But the marble at last grew animated and let it be understood that it didn't do to be at all squeamish if one went to that house, since the woman was always tipsy and the husband so uneducated that he called a corridor a 'collidor'!"
"Je me levai, j’avais une envie irrésistible de baiser la main de la dame en rose, mais il me semblait que c’eût été quelque chose d’audacieux comme un enlèvement. Mon cœur battait tandis que je me disais : « Faut-il le faire, faut-il ne pas le faire », puis je cessai de me demander ce qu’il fallait faire pour pouvoir faire quelque chose. Et d’un geste aveugle et insensé, dépouillé de toutes les raisons que je trouvais il y avait un moment en sa faveur, je portai à mes lèvres la main qu’elle me tendait.","I got up, I had an irresistible desire to kiss the hand of the lady in pink, but it seemed to me that it had been something audacious like an abduction. My heart was pounding as I thought to myself, “Should I do this, should I not do this,” and then I stopped thinking about what I had to do to be able to do something. And with a blind, senseless gesture, stripped of all the reasons I had a moment ago found in her favour, I raised to my lips the hand she held out to me.","I stood up, I had an irresistible desire to kiss the hand of the lady in pink, but it seemed to me this would have been something as bold as an abduction. My heart pounded as I said to myself: “Should I do it, should I not do it,” then I stopped asking myself what I should do so as to be able to do something. And with a blind and senseless gesture divested of all the reasons I had found in its favor a moment ago, I carried to my lips the hand she was holding out to me.","I rose; I could scarcely resist a desire to kiss the hand of the lady in pink, but I felt that to do so would require as much audacity as a forcible abduction of her. My heart beat loud while I counted out to myself ""Shall I do it, shall I not?"" and then I ceased to ask myself what I ought to do so as at least to do something. Blindly, hotly, madly, flinging aside all the reasons I had just found to support such action, I seized and raised to my lips the hand she held out to me."
"Mais il n’avait jamais eu aucun soupçon des actions inconnues des êtres, de celles qui sont sans liens visibles avec leurs propos. Et quand il voulut savoir si c’était plutôt sous le caractère apparent de M. de Charlus, de M. des Laumes, de M. d’Orsan, qu’il devait situer la région inconnue où cet acte ignoble avait dû naître, comme aucun de ces hommes n’avait jamais approuvé devant lui les lettres anonymes et que tout ce qu’ils lui avaient dit impliquait qu’ils les réprouvaient, il ne vit pas plus de raisons pour relier cette infamie plutôt à la nature de l’un que de l’autre. Celle de M. de Charlus était un peu d’un détraqué mais foncièrement bonne et tendre ; celle de M. des Laumes un peu sèche, mais saine et droite. Quant à M. d’Orsan, Swann n’avait jamais rencontré personne qui dans les circonstances même les plus tristes vînt à lui avec une parole plus sentie, un geste plus discret et plus juste.","But he had never had any suspicion of the unknown actions of the beings, of those which are without visible links with their words. And when he wanted to know if it was rather under the apparent character of M. de Charlus, of M. des Laumes, of M. d'Orsan, that he should locate the unknown region where this ignoble act must have been born, as none of these men had ever approved of the anonymous letters before him and that everything they said to him implied that they disapproved of them, he saw no more reason to connect this infamy rather with the nature of one than on the other. That of M. de Charlus was a little crazy, but fundamentally good and tender; that of M. des Laumes a little dry, but healthy and straight. As for M. d'Orsan, Swann had never met anyone who, in even the saddest circumstances, would come to him with a more heartfelt word, a more discreet and just gesture.","But he had never had any feelings of suspicion about the unknown actions of other people, those which had no visible connection with what they said. And when he tried to find out whether it was beneath the apparent character of M. de Charlus, or M. des Laumes, or M. d’Orsan, that he ought to situate the unknown region in which this ignoble act must have been conceived, since none of these men had ever spoken in praise of anonymous letters in his presence and since everything they had said to him implied that they condemned them, he saw no reason for connecting this infamy with the character of one rather than another. That of M. de Charlus was a little deranged but basically good and affectionate; that of M. des Laumes, a little hard, but sound and straightforward. As for M. d’Orsan, Swann had never met anyone who in even the most dismal circumstances would approach him with a more heartfelt remark, a more discreet or appropriate gesture.","But he had never had any suspicion with regard to the unknown actions of other people, those which had no visible connection with what they said.

M. de Charlus was somewhat inclined to eccentricity, but he was fundamentally good and kind ; M. des Laumes was a trifle dry, but wholesome and straight. As for M. d'Orsan, Swann had never met anyone who, even in the most depressing circumstances, would come to him with a more heartfelt utterance, would act more properly or with more discretion."
"Grave incertitude, toutes les fois que l’esprit se sent dépassé par lui-même ; quand lui, le chercheur, est tout ensemble le pays obscur où il doit chercher et où tout son bagage ne lui sera de rien.

""You can't expect him to catch the tone of the house the first time he comes; like Cottard, who has been one of our little 'clan' now for years. The first time doesn't count; it's just for looking round and finding out things. Odette, he understands all right, he's to join us to-morrow at the Châtelet. Perhaps you might call for him and bring him."""
"Pendant que ma tante devisait ainsi avec Françoise, j’accompagnais mes parents à la messe. Que je l’aimais, que je la revois bien, notre église ! Son vieux porche par lequel nous entrions, noir, grêlé comme une écumoire, était dévié et profondément creusé aux angles (de même que le bénitier où il nous conduisait) comme si le doux effleurement des mantes des paysannes entrant à l’église et de leurs doigts timides prenant de l’eau bénite, pouvait, répété pendant des siècles, acquérir une force destructive, infléchir la pierre et l’entailler de sillons comme en trace la roue des carrioles dans la borne contre laquelle elle bute tous les jours. Ses pierres tombales, sous lesquelles la noble poussière des abbés de Combray, enterrés là, faisait au chœur comme un pavage spirituel, n’étaient plus elles-mêmes de la matière inerte et dure, car le temps les avait rendues douces et fait couler comme du miel hors des limites de leur propre équarrissure qu’ici elles avaient dépassées d’un flot blond, entraînant à la dérive une majuscule gothique en fleurs, noyant les violettes blanches du marbre ; et en deçà desquelles, ailleurs, elles s’étaient résorbées, contractant encore l’elliptique inscription latine, introduisant un caprice de plus dans la disposition de ces caractères abrégés, rapprochant deux lettres d’un mot dont les autres avaient été démesurément distendues. Ses vitraux ne chatoyaient jamais tant que les jours où le soleil se montrait peu, de sorte que, fît-il gris dehors, on était sûr qu’il ferait beau dans l’église ; l’un était rempli dans toute sa grandeur par un seul personnage pareil à un Roi de jeu de cartes, qui vivait là-haut, sous un dais architectural, entre ciel et terre ; (et dans le reflet oblique et bleu duquel, parfois les jours de semaine, à midi, quand il n’y a pas d’office – à l’un de ces rares moments où l’église aérée, vacante, plus humaine, luxueuse, avec du soleil sur son riche mobilier, avait l’air presque habitable comme le hall de pierre sculptée et de verre peint, d’un hôtel de style moyen âge – on voyait s’agenouiller un instant MmeSazerat, posant sur le prie-Dieu voisin un paquet tout ficelé de petits fours qu’elle venait de prendre chez le pâtissier d’en face et qu’elle allait rapporter pour le déjeuner) ; dans un autre une montagne de neige rose, au pied de laquelle se livrait un combat, semblait avoir givré à même la verrière qu’elle boursouflait de son trouble grésil comme une vitre à laquelle il serait resté des flocons éclairés par quelque aurore (par la même sans doute qui empourprait le retable de l’autel de tons si frais qu’ils semblaient plutôt posés là momentanément par une lueur du dehors prête à s’évanouir que par des couleurs attachées à jamais à la pierre) ; et tous étaient si anciens qu’on voyait çà et là leur vieillesse argentée étinceler de la poussière des siècles et montrer brillante et usée jusqu’à la corde la trame de leur douce tapisserie de verre. Il y en avait un qui était un haut compartiment divisé en une centaine de petits vitraux rectangulaires où dominait le bleu, comme un grand jeu de cartes pareil à ceux qui devaient distraire le roi Charles VI ; mais soit qu’un rayon eût brillé, soit que mon regard en bougeant eût promené à travers la verrière tour à tour éteinte et rallumée un mouvant et précieux incendie, l’instant d’après elle avait pris l’éclat changeant d’une traîne de paon, puis elle tremblait et ondulait en une pluie flamboyante et fantastique qui dégouttait du haut de la voûte sombre et rocheuse, le long des parois humides, comme si c’était dans la nef de quelque grotte irisée de sinueux stalactites que je suivais mes parents, qui portaient leur paroissien ; un instant après les petits vitraux en losange avaient pris la transparence profonde, l’infrangible dureté de saphirs qui eussent été juxtaposés sur quelque immense pectoral, mais derrière lesquels on sentait, plus aimé que toutes ces richesses, un sourire momentané de soleil ; il était aussi reconnaissable dans le flot bleu et doux dont il baignait les pierreries que sur le pavé de la place ou la paille du marché ; et, même à nos premiers dimanches quand nous étions arrivés avant Pâques, il me consolait que la terre fût encore nue et noire, en faisant épanouir, comme en un printemps historique et qui datait des successeurs de saint Louis, ce tapis éblouissant et doré de myosotis en verre.","While my aunt chatted like this with Françoise, I accompanied my parents to mass. How I loved it, how well I can see it again, our church! Its old porch by which we entered, black, pockmarked like a slotted spoon, was deviated and deeply hollowed out at the corners (like the holy water font to which it led us) as if the soft touch of the mantis of the peasant women entering the church and their shy fingers taking holy water, could, repeated for centuries, acquire a destructive force, bend the stone and cut it with furrows like the wheel of the carts traces in the terminal against which it stumbles every day. Its tombstones, under which the noble dust of the abbots of Combray, buried there, made the choir like a spiritual paving, were no longer themselves inert and hard matter, for time had made them soft and made them flow like honey beyond the limits of their own quarrying, which here they had exceeded with a blond wave, dragging adrift a gothic capital letter in flowers, drowning the white violets of the marble; and below which, elsewhere, they had been reabsorbed, further contracting the elliptical Latin inscription, introducing one more whim into the arrangement of these abbreviated characters, bringing together two letters of a word from which the others had been disproportionately stretched. Its stained-glass windows never shimmered so much as on days when the sun was not very visible, so that, were it gray outside, one was sure that the weather would be fine in the church; one was filled in all its grandeur by a single character like a King of playing cards, who lived up there, under an architectural canopy, between heaven and earth; (and in the oblique blue reflection of which, sometimes on weekdays, at noon, when there is no service – at one of those rare times when the airy, vacant, more human, luxurious church , with sunlight on its rich furniture, looked almost habitable like the hall of carved stone and painted glass, of a medieval style hotel – one could see Mme Sazerat kneeling for a moment, posing on the prie-Dieu next door, a bundle of petit fours that she had just picked up from the pastry chef across the street and was going to bring back for lunch); in another, a mountain of pink snow, at the foot of which a fight was taking place, seemed to have frosted on the very glass roof, which it swelled with its hazy sleet like a pane on which there would have remained flakes lit by some dawn (by the even doubtless who empurpled the reredos of the altar with tones so fresh that they seemed to be put there momentarily by a light from outside ready to vanish rather than by colors attached forever to the stone); and all were so old that here and there their silvery oldness could be seen glinting from the dust of centuries, and showing gleaming and threadbare the thread of their soft tapestry of glass. There was one which was a high compartment divided into a hundred little rectangular stained-glass windows dominated by blue, like a large deck of cards like those which were to entertain King Charles VI; but either a ray had shone, or my gaze as it moved had wandered through the glass roof, which had been extinguished by turns and rekindled a moving and precious fire, the next moment it had taken on the changing brilliance of a train. then it trembled and undulated in a flamboyant and fantastic rain which dripped from the top of the dark and rocky vault, along the damp walls, as if it were in the nave of some iridescent cave of sinuous stalactites that I followed my parents, who carried their parishioner; a moment later the little lozenge-shaped stained-glass windows had taken on the profound transparency, the unbreakable hardness of sapphires which would have been juxtaposed on some immense pectoral, but behind which one felt, more beloved than all these riches, a momentary smile of the sun; he was as recognizable in the soft blue wave with which he bathed the jewels as on the pavement of the square or the straw of the market; and, even on our first Sundays when we had arrived before Easter, it consoled me that the earth was still bare and black, by causing to blossom, as in a historic spring and which dated from the successors of Saint Louis, this dazzling and golden carpet of glass forget-me-nots.","While my aunt was conferring thus with Françoise, I was going to Mass with my parents. How I loved it, how clearly I can see it again; our church! The old porch by which we entered, black, pocked like a skimming ladle, was uneven and deeply hollowed at the edges (like the font to which it led us), as if the gentle brushing of the countrywomen’s cloaks as they entered the church and of their timid fingers taking holy water could, repeated over centuries, acquire a destructive force, bend the stone and carve it with furrows like those traced by the wheel of a cart in a boundary stone which it knocks against every day. Its tombstones, under which the noble dust of the abbots of Combray, who were buried there, formed for the choir a sort of spiritual pavement, were themselves no longer inert and hard matter, for time had softened them and made them flow like honey beyond the bounds of their own square shapes, which, in one place, they had overrun in a flaxen billow, carrying off on their drift a flowery Gothic capital letter, drowning the white violets of the marble; and into which, elsewhere, they had reabsorbed themselves, further contracting the elliptical Latin inscription, introducing a further caprice in the arrangement of those abridged characters, bringing close together two letters of a word of which the others had been disproportionately distended. Its windows never sparkled as much as on the days when the sun hardly appeared, so that, if it was gray outside, we were sure it would be beautiful inside the church; one was filled to its very top by a single figure like a king in a game of cards, who lived up there, under an architectural canopy, between heaven and earth (and in whose slanting blue light, on weekdays sometimes, at noon, when there is no service—at one of those rare times when the church, airy, vacant, more human, luxurious, with some sun on its rich furniture, looked almost habitable, like the hall of a medieval-style mansion, of sculpted stone and stained glass—one would see Mme. Sazerat kneel for a moment, setting down on the next prayer stool a packet of petits fours tied with string that she had just picked up from the pastry shop across the street and was going to take back home for lunch); in another, a mountain of pink snow, at whose foot a battle was being fought, seemed to have frosted onto the glass itself, blistering it with its cloudy sleet like a windowpane on which a few snowflakes remained, but snowflakes lit by some aurora (the same, no doubt, that flushed the reredos of the altar with tints so fresh they seemed set there for a moment by a gleam from outside about to vanish, rather than by colors attached forever to the stone); and all were so old that here and there one saw their silvery age sparkle with the dust of the centuries and show, shimmering and worn down to the thread, the weft of their soft tapestry of glass. One of them, a tall compartment, was divided into a hundred or so small rectangular panes in which blue predominated, like a great deck of cards resembling those meant to entertain King Charles VI;2 but either because a beam of sunlight was shining, or because my gaze, as it moved, carried across the glass, snuffed and lit again by turns, a precious moving conflagration, the next moment it had assumed the changing luster of a peacock’s train, then trembled and undulated in a flaming chimerical rain that dripped from the top of the dark rocky vault, along the damp walls, as if this were the nave of some grotto iridescent with sinuous stalactites into which I was following my parents, who were carrying their prayer books; a moment later the little lozenge-shaped panes had assumed the deep transparency, the infrangible hardness of sapphires which had been juxtaposed on some immense breastplate, but behind which one felt, more beloved than all these riches, a momentary smile of sunlight; it was as recognizable in the soft blue billow with which it bathed the precious stones as on the pavement of the square or the straw of the marketplace; and even on our first Sundays when we had arrived before Easter, it consoled me for the earth being still bare and black, by bringing into bloom, as in a historical springtime dating from the age of Saint Louis’s successors, this dazzling gilded carpet of glass forget-me-nots.","While my aunt gossiped on in this way with Françoise I would have accompanied my parents to mass. How I loved it : how clearly I can see it still, our church at Combray! The old porch by which we went in, black, and full of holes as a cullender, was worn out of shape and deeply furrowed at the sides (as also was the holy water stoup to which it led us) just as if the gentle grazing touch of the cloaks of peasant-women going into the church, and of their fingers dipping into the water, had managed by agelong repetition to acquire a destructive force, to impress itself on the stone, to carve ruts in it like those made by cart-wheels upon stone gate-posts against which they are driven every day. Its memorial stones, beneath which the noble dust of the Abbots of Combray, who were buried there, furnished the choir with a sort of spiritual pavement, were themselves no longer hard and lifeless matter, for time had softened and sweetened them, and had made them melt like honey and flow beyond their proper margins, either surging out in a milky, frothing wave, washing from its place a florid gothic capital, drowning the white violets of the marble floor; or else reabsorbed into their limits, contracting still further a crabbed Latin inscription, bringing a fresh touch of fantasy into the arrangement of its curtailed characters, closing together two letters of some word of which the rest were disproportionately scattered. Its windows were never so brilliant as on days when the sun scarcely shone, so that if it was dull outside you might be certain of fine weather in church. One of them was filled from top to bottom by a solitary figure, like the king on a playing-card, who lived up there beneath his canopy of stone, between earth and heaven; and in the blue light of its slanting shadow, on weekdays sometimes, at noon, when there was no service (at one of those rare moments when the airy, empty church, more human somehow and more luxurious with the sun shewing off all its rich furnishings, seemed to have almost a habitable air, like the hall—all sculptured stone and painted glass—of some mediaeval mansion), you might see Mme. Sazerat kneel for an instant, laying down on the chair beside her own a neatly corded parcel of little cakes which she had just bought at the baker's and was taking home for her luncheon. In another, a mountain of rosy snow, at whose foot a battle was being fought, seemed to have frozen the window also, which it swelled and distorted with its cloudy sleet, like a pane to which snowflakes have drifted and clung, but flakes illumined by a sunrise—the same, doubtless, which purpled the reredos of the altar with tints so fresh that they seemed rather to be thrown on it for a moment by a light shining from outside and shortly to be extinguished than painted and permanently fastened on the stone. And all of them were so old that you could see, here and there, their silvery antiquity sparkling with the dust of centuries and shewing in its threadbare brilliance the very cords of their lovely tapestry of glass. There was one among them which was a tall panel composed of a hundred little rectangular windows, of blue principally, like a great game of patience of the kind planned to beguile King Charles VI; but, either because a ray of sunlight had gleamed through it or because my own shifting vision had drawn across the window, whose colours died away and were rekindled by turns, a rare and transient fire— the next instant it had taken on all the iridescence of a peacock's tail , then shook and wavered in a flaming and fantastic shower, distilled and dropping from the groin of the dark and rocky vault down the moist walls,"
"Mais vous pouvez durer encore comme ça », ceux-là, les uns comme les autres, étaient sûrs de ne plus jamais être reçus. Et si Françoise s’amusait de l’air épouvanté de ma tante quand de son lit elle avait aperçu dans la rue du Saint-Esprit une de ces personnes qui avait l’air de venir chez elle ou quand elle avait entendu un coup de sonnette, elle riait encore bien plus, et comme d’un bon tour, des ruses toujours victorieuses de ma tante pour arriver à les faire congédier et de leur mine déconfite en s’en retournant sans l’avoir vue, et, au fond, admirait sa maîtresse qu’elle jugeait supérieure à tous ces gens puisqu’elle ne voulait pas les recevoir. En somme, ma tante exigeait à la fois qu’on l’approuvât dans son régime, qu’on la plaignît pour ses souffrances et qu’on la rassurât sur son avenir.","But you can still go on like that,” these, like the others, were sure never to be received again. What if Françoise was amused by my aunt's horrified look when from her bed she saw one of those people in the rue du Saint-Esprit who seemed to be coming to her house or when she heard the doorbell ring , she laughed even more, and as if at a good trick, at my aunt's always victorious tricks to get them fired and at their crestfallen expression when she returned without having seen her, and, deep down, admired his mistress whom she considered superior to all these people since she did not want to receive them. In short, my aunt demanded at the same time that we approve of her diet, that we pity her for her sufferings and that we reassure her about her future.","Still, you may last awhile longer yet as you are”—these, the former as well as the latter, were certain never to be received again. And if Françoise was amused by my aunt’s horrified look when from her bed she saw one of these people in the rue du Saint-Esprit apparently coming toward her house or when she heard the doorbell ring, she would laugh more heartily still, and as though at a good trick, at my aunt’s ever-victorious ruses for managing to have them turned away, and at their discomfited expressions as they went off without having seen her, and at heart admired her mistress, whom she felt to be superior to all these people since she did not want to receive them. In short, my aunt required that her visitors at the same time commend her on her regimen, commiserate with her for her sufferings, and encourage her as to her future.","Still, you may last a while yet""; each party alike might be certain that her doors would never open to them again. And if Françoise was amused by the look of consternation on my aunt's face whenever she saw, from her bed, any of these people in the Rue du Saint-Esprit, who looked as if they were coming to see her, or heard her own door-bell ring, she would laugh far more heartily, as at a clever trick, at my aunt's devices (which never failed) for having them sent away, and at their look of discomfiture when they had to turn back without having seen her; and would be filled with secret admiration for her mistress, whom she felt to be superior to all these other people, inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to see them. In short, my aunt stipulated, at one and the same time, that whoever came to see her must approve of her way of life, commiserate with her in her sufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery."

"J’aurai trop prolongé la sieste que je fais tous les soirs en rentrant de ma promenade avec Mme de Saint-Loup, avant d’endosser mon habit. Car bien des années ont passé depuis Combray, où, dans nos retours les plus tardifs, c’était les reflets rouges du couchant que je voyais sur le vitrage de ma fenêtre. C’est un autre genre de vie qu’on mène à Tansonville, chez Mme de Saint-Loup, un autre genre de plaisir que je trouve à ne sortir qu’à la nuit, à suivre au clair de lune ces chemins où je jouais jadis au soleil ; et la chambre où je me serai endormi au lieu de m’habiller pour le dîner, de loin je l’aperçois, quand nous rentrons, traversée par les feux de la lampe, seul phare dans la nuit.","I will have overstayed the siesta I take every evening on returning from my walk with Madame de Saint-Loup, before putting on my coat. Because many years have passed since Combray, where, in our latest returns, it was the red reflections of the sunset that I saw on the glass of my window. It's a different kind of life that one leads in Tansonville, at Madame de Saint-Loup's, a different kind of pleasure that I find in going out only at night, in following in the moonlight these paths where I used to play once in the sun; and the room where I will have fallen asleep instead of dressing for dinner, I can see it from afar, when we return, crossed by the lights of the lamp, the only beacon in the night.","I must have overslept during the nap I take every evening when I come back from my walk with Mme. de Saint-Loup, before putting on my evening clothes. For many years have passed since Combray, where, however late we returned, it was the sunset’s red reflections I saw in the panes of my window. It is another sort of life one leads at Tansonville, at Mme. de Saint-Loup ’s , another sort of pleasure I take in going out only at night, in following by moonlight those lanes where I used to play in the sun; and the room where I fell asleep instead of dressing for dinner—from far off I can see it, as we come back, pierced by the flares of the lamp, a lone beacon in the night.","I must have overslept myself, in the little nap which I always take when I come in from my walk with Mme. de Saint-Loup, before dressing for the evening. For many years have now elapsed since the Combray days, when, coming in from the longest and latest walks, I would still be in time to see the reflection of the sunset glowing in the panes of my bedroom window. It is a very different kind of existence at Tansonville now with Mme. de Saint-Loup, and a different kind of pleasure that I now derive from taking walks only in the evenings, from visiting by moonlight the roads on which I used to play, as a child, in the sunshine; while the bedroom, in which I shall presently fall asleep instead of dressing for dinner, from afar off I can see it, as we return from our walk, with its lamp shining through the window, a solitary beacon in the night."

"Françoise, en effet, qui était depuis des années à son service et ne se doutait pas alors qu’elle entrerait un jour tout à fait au nôtre, délaissait un peu ma tante pendant les mois où nous étions là. Il y avait eu dans mon enfance, avant que nous allions à Combray, quand ma tante Léonie passait encore l’hiver à Paris chez sa mère, un temps où je connaissais si peu Françoise que, le 1er janvier, avant d’entrer chez ma grand’tante, ma mère me mettait dans la main une pièce de cinq francs et me disait : « Surtout ne te trompe pas de personne. Attends pour donner que tu m’entendes dire : « Bonjour Françoise » ; en même temps je te toucherai légèrement le bras. » À peine arrivions-nous dans l’obscure antichambre de ma tante que nous apercevions dans l’ombre, sous les tuyaux d’un bonnet éblouissant, raide et fragile comme s’il avait été de sucre filé, les remous concentriques d’un sourire de reconnaissance anticipé. C’était Françoise, immobile et debout dans l’encadrement de la petite porte du corridor comme une statue de sainte dans sa niche. Quand on était un peu habitué à ces ténèbres de chapelle, on distinguait sur son visage l’amour désintéressé de l’humanité, le respect attendri pour les hautes classes qu’exaltait dans les meilleures régions de son cœur l’espoir des étrennes. Maman me pinçait le bras avec violence et disait d’une voix forte : « Bonjour Françoise. » À ce signal mes doigts s’ouvraient et je lâchais la pièce qui trouvait pour la recevoir une main confuse, mais tendue. Mais depuis que nous allions à Combray je ne connaissais personne mieux que Françoise ; nous étions ses préférés, elle avait pour nous, au moins pendant les premières années, avec autant de considération que pour ma tante, un goût plus vif, parce que nous ajoutions, au prestige de faire partie de la famille (elle avait pour les liens invisibles que noue entre les membres d’une famille la circulation d’un même sang, autant de respect qu’un tragique grec), le charme de n’être pas ses maîtres habituels. Aussi, avec quelle joie elle nous recevait, nous plaignant de n’avoir pas encore plus beau temps, le jour de notre arrivée, la veille de Pâques, où souvent il faisait un vent glacial, quand maman lui demandait des nouvelles de sa fille et de ses neveux, si son petit-fils était gentil, ce qu’on comptait faire de lui, s’il ressemblerait à sa grand’mère.","Françoise, in fact, who had been in his service for years and had no idea then that she would one day fully join ours, somewhat neglected my aunt during the months we were there. There had been in my childhood, before we went to Combray, when my aunt Léonie was still spending the winter in Paris with her mother, a time when I knew Françoise so little that, on January 1, before going to my great-aunt, my mother put a five-franc piece in my hand and said to me: ""Above all, don't get the wrong person."" Wait to give that you hear me say: “Hello Françoise”; at the same time I will lightly touch your arm. No sooner had we arrived in my aunt's dark antechamber than we saw in the shadows, under the pipes of a dazzling bonnet, stiff and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the concentric eddies of a smile of anticipated recognition. It was Françoise, motionless and standing in the frame of the little door in the corridor like a statue of a saint in its niche. When one was a little accustomed to this darkness of the chapel, one could distinguish on his face the disinterested love of humanity, the tender respect for the upper classes which exalted in the best regions of his heart the hope of New Year's Eve. Mom pinched my arm violently and said in a loud voice: “Hello Françoise. At this signal my fingers opened and I let go of the coin, which found a confused but outstretched hand to receive it. But since we went to Combray I knew no one better than Françoise; we were her favourites, she had for us, at least during the first years, with as much consideration as for my aunt, a keener taste, because we added, to the prestige of being part of the family (she had for the ties invisible that ties between the members of a family the circulation of the same blood, as much respect as a tragic Greek), the charm of not being its usual masters. Also, with what joy she received us, complaining that the weather was not even better, the day of our arrival, the day before Easter, when it was often an icy wind, when Mama asked her about her daughter and of his nephews, if his grandson was nice, what they intended to do with him, if he would look like his grandmother.","Françoise, who had been in her service for years and did not suspect at that time that one day she would enter exclusively into ours, did in fact neglect my aunt a little during the months when we were there. There had been a time, in my childhood, before we went to Combray, when my aunt Léonie still spent the winters in Paris with her mother, when Françoise was such a stranger to me that on the first of January, before entering my great-aunt’s, my mother would put a five-franc coin in my hand and say to me: “Take great care not to give it to the wrong person. Wait until you hear me say, ‘Good morning, Françoise’; at the same time, I’ll touch you lightly on the arm.” Hardly had we arrived in my aunt’s dim hall than we would see in the shadows, under the flutes of a dazzling bonnet as stiff and fragile as if it were made of spun sugar, the concentric ripples of an anticipatory smile of gratitude. It was Françoise, standing motionless in the frame of the little door of the corridor like the statue of a saint in its niche. When we were a little used to this chapel darkness, we could distinguish on her face the disinterested love of humanity, the fond respect for the upper classes excited in the best regions of her heart by the hope of a New Year’s gift. Mama would pinch my arm violently and say in a loud voice: “Good morning, Françoise.” At this signal, my fingers would open and I would release the coin, which found a bashful but outstretched hand to receive it. But ever since we had begun going to Combray I knew no one better than Françoise, we were her favorites, she had for us, at least during the first years, not only as much regard as for my aunt, but also a keener liking, because we added, to the prestige of being part of the family (she had, for the invisible bonds formed between the members of a family by the circulation of the same blood, as much respect as a Greek tragedian), the charm of not being her usual masters. And so with what joy would she welcome us, commiserate with us that we did not yet have finer weather, the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was often an icy wind, while Mama would ask her for news of her daughter and her nephews, whether her grandson was a pretty child, what they were planning to make of him, whether he was going to be like his grandmother.","Françoise, who had been for many years in my aunt's service and did not at that time suspect that she would one day be transferred entirely to ours, was a little inclined to desert my aunt during the months which we spent in her house. There had been in my infancy, before we first went to Combray, and when my aunt Léonie used still to spend the winter in Paris with her mother, a time when I knew Françoise so little that on New Year's Day, before going into my great-aunt's house, my mother put a five-franc piece in my hand and said: ""Now, be careful. Don't make any mistake. Wait until you hear me say ' Good morning, Françoise,' and I touch your arm before you give it to her."" No sooner had we arrived in my aunt's dark hall than we saw in the gloom, beneath the frills of a snowy cap as stiff and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the concentric waves of a smile of anticipatory gratitude. It was Françoise, motionless and erect, framed in the small doorway of the corridor like the statue of a saint in its niche. When we had grown more accustomed to this religious darkness we could discern in her features a disinterested love of all humanity, blended with a tender respect for the 'upper classes' which raised to the most honourable quarter of her heart the hope of receiving her due reward. Mamma pinched my arm sharply and said in a loud voice: ""Good morning, Françoise. "" At this signal my fingers parted and I let fall the coin, which found a receptacle in a confused but outstretched hand. But since we had begun to go to Combray there was no one I knew better than Françoise. We were her favourites, and in the first years at least, while she shewed the same consideration for us as for my aunt, she enjoyed us with a keener relish, because we had, in addition to our dignity as part of 'the family' (for she had for those invisible bonds by which community of blood unites the members of a family as much respect as any Greek tragedian), the fresh charm of not being her customary employers. And so with what joy would she welcome us, with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so bad for us, on the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was often an icy wind; while Mamma inquired after her daughter and her nephews, and if her grandson was good-looking, and what they were going to make of him, and whether he took after his granny."
"N’est-il pas vrai, madame ? demanda Brichot à MmeVerdurin qui, pâmant, les yeux fermés, précipita sa figure dans ses mains d’où s’échappèrent des cris étouffés.","Isn't that right, lady?

Verdurin, who, swooning with laughter, her eyes shut, plunged her face into her hands, from which stifled cries escaped.","Am I not right, Madame? "" Brichot appealed to Mme. Verdurin, who, swooning with merriment, her eyes tightly closed, had buried her face in her two hands, from between which, now and then, escaped a muffled scream."
"S’il était assez simple d’aller du côté de Méséglise, c’était une autre affaire d’aller du côté de Guermantes, car la promenade était longue et l’on voulait être sûr du temps qu’il ferait. Quand on semblait entrer dans une série de beaux jours ; quand Françoise désespérée qu’il ne tombât pas une goutte d’eau pour les « pauvres récoltes », et ne voyant que de rares nuages blancs nageant à la surface calme et bleue du ciel s’écriait en gémissant : « Ne dirait-on pas qu’on voit ni plus ni moins des chiens de mer qui jouent en montrant là-haut leurs museaux ? Ah ! ils pensent bien à faire pleuvoir pour les pauvres laboureurs ! Et puis quand les blés seront poussés, alors la pluie se mettra à tomber tout à petit patapon, sans discontinuer, sans plus savoir sur quoi elle tombe que si c’était sur la mer » ; quand mon père avait reçu invariablement les mêmes réponses favorables du jardinier et du baromètre, alors on disait au dîner : « Demain s’il fait le même temps, nous irons du côté de Guermantes. » On partait tout de suite après déjeuner par la petite porte du jardin et on tombait dans la rue des Perchamps, étroite et formant un angle aigu, remplie de graminées au milieu desquelles deux ou trois guêpes passaient la journée à herboriser, aussi bizarre que son nom d’où me semblaient dériver ses particularités curieuses et sa personnalité revêche, et qu’on chercherait en vain dans le Combray d’aujourd’hui où sur son tracé ancien s’élève l’école. Mais ma rêverie (semblable à ces architectes élèves de Viollet-le-Duc, qui, croyant retrouver sous un jubé Renaissance et un autel du XVIIe siècle les traces d’un chœur roman, remettent tout l’édifice dans l’état où il devait être au VIIe siècle) ne laisse pas une pierre du bâtiment nouveau, reperce et « restitue » la rue des Perchamps. Elle a d’ailleurs pour ces reconstitutions des données plus précises que n’en ont généralement les restaurateurs : quelques images conservées par ma mémoire, les dernières peut-être qui existent encore actuellement, et destinées à être bientôt anéanties, de ce qu’était le Combray du temps de mon enfance ; et parce que c’est lui-même qui les a tracées en moi avant de disparaître, émouvantes – si on peut comparer un obscur portrait à ces effigies glorieuses dont ma grand’mère aimait à me donner des reproductions – comme ces gravures anciennes de la Cène ou ce tableau de Gentile Bellini, dans lesquels l’on voit en un état qui n’existe plus aujourd’hui le chef-d’œuvre de Vinci et le portail de Saint-Marc.","If it was quite easy to go towards Méséglise, it was another matter to go towards Guermantes, because the walk was long and we wanted to be sure of the weather. When we seemed to be entering a series of beautiful days; when Françoise, in despair that not a drop of water would fall for the ""poor harvests"", and seeing only rare white clouds swimming on the calm and blue surface of the sky, exclaimed with a groan: ""Wouldn't one say that we see no more and no less sea dogs playing, showing their muzzles up there? Ah! they think of making it rain for the poor ploughmen! And then when the wheat has sprung up, then the rain will begin to fall little by little patapon, without stopping, without knowing what it is falling on any more than if it were on the sea”; when my father had invariably received the same favorable answers from the gardener and the barometer, then we said at dinner: ""Tomorrow if the weather is the same, we will go to Guermantes."" We would leave immediately after lunch through the little garden gate and find ourselves in the Rue des Perchamps, narrow and forming an acute angle, filled with grasses in the midst of which two or three wasps were spending the day planting herbs, as bizarre as its appearance. a name from which it seemed to me to derive its curious peculiarities and its surly personality, and which one would seek in vain in the Combray of today where on its old layout stands the school. But my reverie (like those architects who were students of Viollet-le-Duc, who, believing they had found traces of a Romanesque choir under a Renaissance rood screen and a 17th-century altar, restored the whole building to the state it should have be in the 7th century) does not leave a stone of the new building, pierces and ""restores"" the rue des Perchamps. Moreover, she has more precise data for these reconstructions than restorers generally have: a few images preserved by my memory, the last perhaps which still exist today, and destined to be soon annihilated, of what was the Combray from my childhood; and because it was he himself who traced them in me before disappearing, moving – if one can compare an obscure portrait to those glorious effigies of which my grandmother liked to give me reproductions – like those old engravings of the Last Supper or this painting by Gentile Bellini, in which we see in a state that no longer exists today the masterpiece of Vinci and the portal of Saint Mark.","If it was fairly simple to go the Méséglise way, it was another matter to go the Guermantes way, because the walk was long and we wanted to be sure what sort of weather we would be having. When we seemed to be entering a succession of fine days; when Françoise, desperate because not a single drop of water had fallen on the “poor crops,” and seeing only rare white clouds swimming on the calm blue surface of the sky, exclaimed with a moan: “Why, they look just like a lot of dog-fishes playing about up yonder showing us their muzzles! Ah, they never think to make it rain a little for the poor farmers! And then as soon as the wheat is well up, that’s when the rain will begin to fall pit-a-pat pit-a-pat without a break, and think no more of where it’s falling than if ’ twas falling on the sea”; when my father had been given the same unvarying favorable responses by both the gardener and the barometer, then we would say over dinner: “Tomorrow, if the weather’s the same, we’ll go the Guermantes way.” We would leave right after lunch by the little garden gate and we would tumble out into the rue des Perchamps, narrow and bent at a sharp angle and filled with different varieties of grasses among which two or three wasps would spend the day botanizing, a street as odd as its name, which it seemed to me was the source of its curious peculiarities and its cantankerous personality, a street one would seek in vain in Combray now, for on its old path the school now stands. But in my daydreams (like those architects, pupils of Viollet-le-Duc,49 who, thinking they will find under a Renaissance rood screen or a seventeenth-century altar the traces of a Romanesque choir, restore the whole edifice to the state in which it must have been in the twelfth century) I do not leave one stone of the new structure standing, I pierce through it and “reinstate” the rue des Perchamps. And for these reconstructions I also have more precise data than restorers generally have: a few pictures preserved by my memory, perhaps the last still in existence now, and destined soon to be obliterated, of what Combray was during the time of my childhood; and, because Combray itself drew them in me before disappearing, they are as moving—if one may compare an obscure portrait to those glorious representations of which my grandmother liked to give me reproductions—as those old engravings of the Last Supper or that painting by Gentile Bellini, in which one sees, in a state in which they no longer exist, da Vinci’s masterpiece and the portal of Saint Mark’s.50","* * * If the 'Méséglise way' was so easy, it was a very different matter when we took the 'Guermantes way,' for that meant a long walk, and we must make sure, first, of the weather. When we seemed to have entered upon a spell of fine days, when Françoise, in desperation that not a drop was falling upon the 'poor crops,' gazing up at the sky and seeing there only a little white cloud floating here and there upon its calm, azure surface, groaned aloud and exclaimed: ""You would say they were nothing more nor less than a lot of dogfish swimming about and sticking up their snouts! Ah, they never think of making it rain a little for the poor labourers! And then when the corn is all ripe, down it will come, rattling all over the place, and think no more of where it is falling than if it was on the sea!""—when my father's appeals to the gardener had met with the same encouraging answer several times in succession, then some one would say, at dinner: ""To-morrow, if the weather holds, we might go the Guermantes way."" And off we would set, immediately after luncheon, through the little garden gate which dropped us into the Rue des Perchamps, narrow and bent at a sharp angle, dotted with grass-plots over which two or three wasps would spend the day botanising, a street as quaint as its name, from which its odd characteristics and its personality were, I felt, derived; a street for which one might search in vain through the Combray of to-day, for the public school now rises upon its site. But in my dreams of Combray (like those architects, pupils of Viollet-le-Duc, who, fancying that they can detect, beneath a Renaissance rood-loft and an eighteenth-century altar, traces of a Norman choir, restore the whole church to the state in which it probably was in the twelfth century) I leave not a stone of the modern edifice standing, I pierce through it and 'restore' the Rue des Perchamps. And for such reconstruction memory furnishes me with more detailed guidance than is generally at the disposal of restorers; the pictures which it has preserved—perhaps the last surviving in the world to-day, and soon to follow the rest into oblivion—of what Combray looked like in my childhood's days; pictures which, simply because it was the old Combray that traced their outlines upon my mind before it vanished, are as moving—if I may compare a humble landscape with those glorious works, reproductions of which my grandmother was so fond of bestowing on me—as those old engravings of the 'Cenacolo,' or that painting by Gentile Bellini, in which one sees, in a state in which they no longer exist, the masterpiece of Leonardo and the portico of Saint Mark's."
"D’ailleurs on commençait à éteindre partout. Sous les arbres des boulevards, dans une obscurité mystérieuse, les passants plus rares erraient, à peine reconnaissables. Parfois l’ombre d’une femme qui s’approchait de lui, lui murmurant un mot à l’oreille, lui demandant de la ramener, fit tressaillir Swann.

Under the trees of the boulevards, in a mysterious darkness, the rarer passers-by wandered, barely recognizable.

He anxiously brushed past all those obscure bodies as if among the ghosts of the dead, in the dark realm, he had been looking for Eurydice.","Lights were beginning to go out all around him.

He brushed anxiously against all those dim bodies as if, among the phantoms of the dead, in the kingdom of darkness, he were searching for Eurydice.","Meanwhile the restaurants were closing, and their lights began to go out. Under the trees of the boulevards there were still a few people strolling to and fro, barely distinguishable in the gathering darkness. Now and then the ghost of a woman glided up to Swann, murmured a few words in his ear, asked him to take her home, and left him shuddering. Anxiously he explored every one of these vaguely seen shapes, as though among the phantoms of the dead, in the realms of darkness, he had been searching for a lost Eurydice."

"– Je n’irai pas jusqu’à dire que c’est ce qu’il y a de plus vilain, car s’il y a à Saint-Hilaire des parties qui méritent d’être visitées, il y en a d’autres qui sont bien vieilles dans ma pauvre basilique, la seule de tout le diocèse qu’on n’ait pas restaurée ! Mon Dieu, le porche est sale et antique, mais enfin d’un caractère majestueux ; passe même pour les tapisseries d’Esther dont personnellement je ne donnerais pas deux sous, mais qui sont placées par les connaisseurs tout de suite après celles de Sens. Je reconnais d’ailleurs, qu’à côté de certains détails un peu réalistes, elles en présentent d’autres qui témoignent d’un véritable esprit d’observation. Mais qu’on ne vienne pas me parler des vitraux. Cela a-t-il du bon sens de laisser des fenêtres qui ne donnent pas de jour et trompent même la vue par ces reflets d’une couleur que je ne saurais définir, dans une église où il n’y a pas deux dalles qui soient au même niveau et qu’on se refuse à me remplacer sous prétexte que ce sont les tombes des abbés de Combray et des seigneurs de Guermantes, les anciens comtes de Brabant. Les ancêtres directs du Duc de Guermantes d’aujourd’hui et aussi de la Duchesse puisqu’elle est une demoiselle de Guermantes qui a épousé son cousin. » (Ma grand’mère qui à force de se désintéresser des personnes finissait par confondre tous les noms, chaque fois qu’on prononçait celui de la Duchesse de Guermantes prétendait que ce devait être une parente de Mme de Villeparisis. Tout le monde éclatait de rire ; elle tâchait de se défendre en alléguant une certaine lettre de faire part : « Il me semblait me rappeler qu’il y avait du Guermantes là dedans. » Et pour une fois j’étais avec les autres contre elle, ne pouvant admettre qu’il y eût un lien entre son amie de pension et la descendante de Geneviève de Brabant.) – « Voyez Roussainville, ce n’est plus aujourd’hui qu’une paroisse de fermiers, quoique dans l’antiquité cette localité ait dû un grand essor au commerce de chapeaux de feutre et des pendules.

Je croirais volontiers que le nom primitif était Rouville (Radulfi villa) comme Châteauroux (Castrum Radulfi), mais je vous parlerai de cela une autre fois.) Hé bien ! l’église a des vitraux superbes, presque tous modernes, et cette imposante Entrée de Louis-Philippe à Combray qui serait mieux à sa place à Combray même, et qui vaut, dit-on, la fameuse verrière de Chartres. Je voyais même hier le frère du docteur Percepied qui est amateur et qui la regarde comme d’un plus beau travail.","– I won't go so far as to say that it's the worst part, because if there are parts of Saint-Hilaire that deserve to be visited, there are others. which are very old in my poor basilica, the only one in the whole diocese which has not been restored! My God, the porch is dirty and ancient, but still of a majestic character; goes even for the tapestries of Esther which personally I would not give two cents, but which are placed by connoisseurs immediately after those of Sens. I recognize, moreover, that alongside some slightly realistic details, they present others that bear witness to a true spirit of observation. But don't talk to me about the stained glass windows. Does it make sense to leave windows which do not let in daylight and even deceive the view by these reflections of a color which I cannot define, in a church where there are not two slabs which are at the same level and that they refuse to replace me on the pretext that these are the tombs of the abbots of Combray and the lords of Guermantes, the former counts of Brabant. The direct ancestors of today's Duke of Guermantes and also of the Duchess since she is a young lady of Guermantes who married her cousin. (My grandmother, who by dint of being disinterested in people, ended up by confusing all the names, each time the name of the Duchesse de Guermantes was mentioned, she claimed that she must be a relative of Madame de Villeparisis. Everyone was bursting with laughing; she tried to defend herself by alleging a certain letter to share: ""I seemed to remember that there was some Guermantes in there.""

I would gladly believe that the primitive name was Rouville (Radulfi villa) like Châteauroux (Castrum Radulfi), but I will tell you about that another time.) Well! the church has superb stained-glass windows, almost all of them modern, and this imposing Entry of Louis-Philippe at Combray which would be better placed in Combray itself, and which, it is said, is worth the famous glass roof of Chartres. I even saw Dr. Percepied's brother yesterday, who is an amateur and who regards it as a finer piece of work.","“I will not go so far as to say it is the ugliest, for if there are some parts of Saint-Hilaire that are well worth a visit, there are others that are very old now, in my poor basilica, the only one in all the diocese that has never even been restored!

I can quite see, too, that apart from certain rather realistic details, they offer other details that show a genuine power of observation. But don’t talk to me about the windows! Is it really sensible to leave us with windows that give no light and even deceive our eyes with patches of color I would never be able to identify, in a church where no two paving stones are on the same level and they refuse to replace them for me, giving the excuse that these are the tombstones of the Abbés de Combray and the Seigneurs de Guermantes, the old Comtes de Brabant? The direct ancestors of the present Duc de Guermantes and of the Duchesse too since she’s a Demoiselle de Guermantes who married her cousin.” (My grandmother, who, because she took no great interest in “persons,” ended by confusing all names, would claim, each time anyone mentioned the Duchesse de Guermantes, that she must be a relative of Mme. de Villeparisis. Everyone would burst out laughing; she would try to defend herself by citing as proof a certain letter containing an announcement: “It seems to me I recall there was something about Guermantes in it.” And for once I would side with the others against her, unable to admit that there was any connection between her friend from boarding school and the descendant of Geneviève de Brabant.) “Look at Roussainville, today it is no more than a parish of farmers, though in ancient times the locality experienced a great boom in the commerce of felt hats and clocks.

The Lord knows, our porch is dirty and out of date; still, it is of a majestic character; take, for instance, the Esther tapestries, though personally I would not give a brass farthing for the pair of them, but experts put them next after the ones at Sens. I can quite see, too, that apart from certain details which are—well, a trifle realistic, they shew features which testify to a genuine power of observation. But don't talk to me about the windows.

The whole family would then burst out laughing; and she would attempt to justify herself by harking back to some invitation to a christening or funeral: ""I feel sure that there was a Guermantes in it somewhere."" And for once I would side with the others, and against her, refusing to admit that there could be any connection between her school-friend and the descendant of Geneviève de Brabant.)

Very well; the church there has superb windows, almost all quite modern, including that most imposing 'Entry of Louis-Philippe into Combray' which would be more in keeping, surely, at Combray itself, and which is every bit as good, I understand, as the famous^windows at Chartres.

"Nous rentrions toujours de bonne heure de nos promenades pour pouvoir faire une visite à ma tante Léonie avant le dîner. Au commencement de la saison où le jour finit tôt, quand nous arrivions rue du Saint-Esprit, il y avait encore un reflet du couchant sur les vitres de la maison et un bandeau de pourpre au fond des bois du Calvaire qui se reflétait plus loin dans l’étang, rougeur qui, accompagnée souvent d’un froid assez vif, s’associait, dans mon esprit, à la rougeur du feu au-dessus duquel rôtissait le poulet qui ferait succéder pour moi au plaisir poétique donné par la promenade, le plaisir de la gourmandise, de la chaleur et du repos. Dans l’été au contraire, quand nous rentrions, le soleil ne se couchait pas encore ; et pendant la visite que nous faisions chez ma tante Léonie, sa lumière qui s’abaissait et touchait la fenêtre était arrêtée entre les grands rideaux et les embrasses, divisée, ramifiée, filtrée, et incrustant de petits morceaux d’or le bois de citronnier de la commode, illuminait obliquement la chambre avec la délicatesse qu’elle prend dans les sous-bois. Mais certains jours fort rares, quand nous rentrions, il y avait bien longtemps que la commode avait perdu ses incrustations momentanées, il n’y avait plus quand nous arrivions rue du Saint-Esprit nul reflet de couchant étendu sur les vitres et l’étang au pied du calvaire avait perdu sa rougeur, quelquefois il était déjà couleur d’opale et un long rayon de lune qui allait en s’élargissant et se fendillait de toutes les rides de l’eau le traversait tout entier. Alors, en arrivant près de la maison, nous apercevions une forme sur le pas de la porte et maman me disait :","We always came home early from our walks so that we could pay my aunt Léonie a visit before dinner. At the beginning of the season when the day ends early, when we arrived in the rue du Saint-Esprit, there was still a reflection of the setting sun on the windows of the house and a band of purple at the bottom of the woods of Calvaire which was reflected further on. in the pond, a redness which, often accompanied by a fairly sharp cold, was associated, in my mind, with the redness of the fire above which the chicken was roasting, which for me would succeed the poetic pleasure given by the walk, the pleasure of gluttony, warmth and rest. In summer, on the contrary, when we returned, the sun had not yet set; and during our visit to my Aunt Léonie, her light, which lowered and touched the window, was stopped between the large curtains and the tiebacks, divided, branched, filtered, and encrusting the lemon tree wood with small pieces of gold. of the chest of drawers, obliquely illuminated the room with the delicacy it takes on in the undergrowth. But on some very rare days, when we came home, the chest of drawers had long since lost its momentary encrustations, when we arrived in rue du Saint-Esprit there was no longer any reflection of the setting sun stretched out on the windows and the pond. at the foot of the Calvary had lost its redness, sometimes it was already the color of opal and a long ray of the moon which grew wider and cracked with all the ripples of the water crossed it entirely. So, when we got near the house, we saw a shape on the doorstep and mom said to me:","We always returned in good time from our walks so that we could pay a visit to my aunt Léonie before dinner. At the beginning of the season, when the days ended early, when we reached the rue du Saint-Esprit there was still a reflection of the sunset on the windowpanes of the house and a band of crimson deep in the timbers of the Calvary, which was reflected farther off in the pool, a red which, often accompanied by a rather brisk chill, was associated in my mind with the red of the fire over which was roasting the chicken that would allow the poetic pleasure given me by the walk to be succeeded by the pleasure of gluttony, warmth and rest. But in the summer, when we returned, the sun was not yet setting; and during the visit we made to my aunt Léonie, its light, lowering and touching the window, had stopped between the great curtains and the curtain loops, divided, ramified, filtered, and, encrusting the lemon wood of the chest of drawers with little pieces of gold, illuminated the room obliquely with the delicacy it acquires in the forest undergrowth. But on certain very rare days, when we returned, the chest had lost its momentary encrustations long before, when we reached the rue du Saint-Esprit there was no reflection of the sunset spread over the windowpanes, and the pool at the foot of the Calvary had lost its red, sometimes it was already the color of opal and a long ray of moonlight that grew broader and broader and broke over all the wrinkles of the water traversed it entirely. Then, as we came near the house, we would see a figure on the doorstep and Mama would say to me:","We used always to return from our walks in good time to pay aunt Léonie a visit before dinner. In the first weeks of our Combray holidays, when the days ended early, we would still be able to see, as we turned into the Rue du Saint-Esprit, a reflection of the western sky from the windows of the house and a band of purple at the foot of the Calvary, which was mirrored further on in the pond; a fiery glow which, accompanied often by a cold that burned and stung, would associate itself in my mind with the glow of the fire over which, at that very moment, was roasting the chicken that was to furnish me, in place of the poetic pleasure I had found in my walk, with the sensual pleasures of good feeding, warmth and rest. But in summer, when we came back to the house, the sun would not have set; and while we were upstairs paying our visit to aunt Léonie its rays, sinking until they touched and lay along her window-sill, would there be caught and held by the large inner curtains and the bands which tied them back to the wall, and split and scattered and filtered; and then, at last, would fall upon and inlay with tiny flakes of gold the lemonwood of her chest-of-drawers, illuminating the room in their passage with the same delicate, slanting, shadowed beams that fall among the boles of forest trees. But on some days, though very rarely, the chest-of-drawers would long since have shed its momentary adornments, there would no longer, as we turned into the Rue du Saint-Esprit, be any reflection from the western sky burning along the line of window-panes; the pond beneath the Calvary would have lost its fiery glow, sometimes indeed had changed already to an opalescent pallor, while a long ribbon of moonlight, bent and broken and broadened by every ripple upon the water's surface, would be lying across it, from end to end. Then, as we drew near the house, we would make out a figure standing upon the doorstep, and Mamma would say to me: """
"– Tiens, disait ma tante en se frappant le front, cela me fait penser que je n’ai point su si elle était arrivée à l’église après l’élévation. Il faudra que je pense à le demander à Eulalie…","""Look,"" said my aunt, slapping her forehead, ""that makes me think I didn't know if she had arrived at the church after the elevation."" I'll have to remember to ask Eulalie...","“Oh dear,” said my aunt, striking her forehead, “that reminds me I never found out if she arrived at church after the Elevation. I will have to remember to ask Eulalie . . .","""There, now,"" went on my aunt, beating her brow, ""that reminds me that I never heard if she got to church this morning before the Elevation. I must remember to ask Eulalie..."
"– Quand je vous disais qu’on ne peut pas garder son sérieux avec lui, dit MmeVerdurin à Forcheville.

When you least expect it, he pulls out a calembredaine.","“Didn’t I tell you? He won’t allow anyone to be serious,” said Mme. Verdurin to Forcheville. “Just when you least expect it, he comes out with a pun.”","""What did I tell you?"" said Mme. Verdurin to Forcheville. ""It's simply impossible to be serious with him.

"Les sadiques de l’espèce de MlleVinteuil sont des êtres si purement sentimentaux, si naturellement vertueux que même le plaisir sensuel leur paraît quelque chose de mauvais, le privilège des méchants. Et quand ils se concèdent à eux-mêmes de s’y livrer un moment, c’est dans la peau des méchants qu’ils tâchent d’entrer et de faire entrer leur complice, de façon à avoir eu un moment l’illusion de s’être évadés de leur âme scrupuleuse et tendre, dans le monde inhumain du plaisir. Et je comprenais combien elle l’eût désiré en voyant combien il lui était impossible d’y réussir. Au moment où elle se voulait si différente de son père, ce qu’elle me rappelait, c’était les façons de penser, de dire, du vieux professeur de piano. Bien plus que sa photographie, ce qu’elle profanait, ce qu’elle faisait servir à ses plaisirs mais qui restait entre eux et elle et l’empêchait de les goûter directement, c’était la ressemblance de son visage, les yeux bleus de sa mère à lui qu’il lui avait transmis comme un bijou de famille, ces gestes d’amabilité qui interposaient entre le vice de MlleVinteuil et elle une phraséologie, une mentalité qui n’était pas faite pour lui et l’empêchait de le connaître, comme quelque chose de très différent des nombreux devoirs de politesse auxquels elle se consacrait d’habitude. Ce n’est pas le mal qui lui donnait l’idée du plaisir, qui lui semblait agréable ; c’est le plaisir qui lui semblait malin. Et comme chaque fois qu’elle s’y adonnait il s’accompagnait pour elle de ces pensées mauvaises qui le reste du temps étaient absentes de son âme vertueuse, elle finissait par trouver au plaisir quelque chose de diabolique, par l’identifier au Mal. Peut-être MlleVinteuil sentait-elle que son amie n’était pas foncièrement mauvaise, et qu’elle n’était pas sincère au moment où elle lui tenait ces propos blasphématoires. Du moins avait-elle le plaisir d’embrasser sur son visage des sourires, des regards, feints peut-être, mais analogues dans leur expression vicieuse et basse à ceux qu’aurait eus non un être de bonté et de souffrance, mais un être de cruauté et de plaisir. Elle pouvait s’imaginer un instant qu’elle jouait vraiment les jeux qu’eût joués, avec une complice aussi dénaturée, une fille qui aurait ressenti en effet ces sentiments barbares à l’égard de la mémoire de son père. Peut-être n’eût-elle pas pensé que le mal fût un état si rare, si extraordinaire, si dépaysant, où il était si reposant d’émigrer, si elle avait su discerner en elle, comme en tout le monde, cette indifférence aux souffrances qu’on cause et qui, quelques autres noms qu’on lui donne, est la forme terrible et permanente de la cruauté.","Sadists like Mlle. Vinteuil are such purely sentimental beings, so naturally virtuous that even sensual pleasure seems to them something bad, the privilege of the wicked. And when they concede to themselves to indulge in it for a moment, it is in the skin of the wicked that they try to enter and bring in their accomplice, so as to have had for a moment the illusion of having escaped from their scrupulous and tender soul, into the inhuman world of pleasure. And I understood how much she would have desired it, seeing how impossible it was for her to succeed. When she wanted to be so different from her father, what she reminded me of was the ways of thinking, of saying, of the old piano teacher. Much more than her photograph, what she profane, what she used for her pleasures but which remained between them and her and prevented her from tasting them directly, was the resemblance of her face, the blue eyes of his own mother that he had passed on to her like a family jewel, these gestures of kindness which interposed between Mlle Vinteuil's vice and her a phraseology, a mentality which was not made for him and prevented her from knowing it , as something very different from the many polite duties to which she usually devoted herself. It was not evil that gave him the idea of pleasure, which seemed agreeable to him; it was pleasure that seemed to him malignant. And as each time she indulged in it, it was accompanied for her by those evil thoughts which the rest of the time were absent from her virtuous soul, she ended up finding something diabolical in pleasure, identifying it with Evil. . Perhaps Mademoiselle Vinteuil felt that her friend was not fundamentally bad, and that she was not sincere when she said these blasphemous remarks to her. At least she had the pleasure of embracing on her face smiles, looks, feigned perhaps, but analogous in their vicious and base expression to those which would have had not a being of goodness and suffering, but a being cruelty and pleasure. She could imagine for a moment that she was really playing the games that would have been played, with such an unnatural accomplice, by a girl who would indeed have felt these barbarous feelings with regard to the memory of her father. Perhaps she would not have thought that illness was such a rare, extraordinary, exotic state, where it was so restful to emigrate, if she had been able to discern in herself, as in everyone else, this indifference to the sufferings that we cause and which, whatever other names we give to it, is the terrible and permanent form of cruelty.","Sadists of Mlle. Vinteuil’s kind are creatures so purely sentimental, so naturally virtuous that even sensual pleasure seems to them something bad, the privilege of the wicked. And when they allow themselves to yield to it for a moment, they are trying to step into the skin of the wicked and to make their partner do so as well, so as to have the illusion, for a moment, of escaping from their scrupulous and tender soul into the inhuman world of pleasure. And I understood how much she longed for it when I saw how impossible it was for her to succeed in it. At the very moment when she wanted to be so different from her father, what she at once suggested to me were the old piano teacher’s ways of thinking, of speaking. Far more than his photograph, what she really desecrated, what she was really using for her pleasures, though it remained between them and her and kept her from enjoying them directly, was the resemblance between her face and his, his own mother’s blue eyes which he had handed down to her like a family jewel, those kind gestures which interposed between Mlle. Vinteuil’s vice and herself a style of talking, a mentality that was not made for it and that prevented her from recognizing it as something very different from the numberless obligatory courtesies to which she usually devoted herself. It was not evil which gave her the idea of pleasure, which seemed agreeable to her; it was pleasure that seemed to her malign. And since each time she indulged in it, it was accompanied by these bad thoughts which were absent the rest of the time from her virtuous soul, she came to see pleasure as something diabolical, to identify it with Evil. Perhaps Mlle. Vinteuil felt that her friend was not fundamentally bad and was not really sincere when she talked to her in this blasphemous way. At least she had the pleasure of kissing her friend’s face with its smiles and glances that might have been feigned but were similar in their depraved and base expression to the smiles and glances of, not a kind, suffering person, but one given to cruelty and pleasure. She could imagine for a moment that she was really playing the games that would have been played, with so unnatural a confederate, by a girl who actually had these barbaric feelings toward her father’s memory. Perhaps she would not have thought that evil was a state so rare, so extraordinary, so disorienting, and to which it was so restful to emigrate, if she had been able to discern in herself, as in everyone else, that indifference to the sufferings one causes which, whatever other names one gives it, is the terrible and lasting form assumed by cruelty.","Sadists' of Mlle. Vinteuil's sort are creatures so purely sentimental, so virtuous by nature, that even sensual pleasure appears to them as something bad, a privilege reserved for the wicked. And when they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it they endeavour to impersonate, to assume all the outward appearance of wicked people, for themselves and their partners in guilt, so as to gain the momentary illusion of having escaped beyond the control of their own gentle and scrupulous natures into the inhuman world of pleasure. And I could understand how she must have longed for such an escape when I realised that it was impossible for her to effect it. At the moment when she wished to be thought the very antithesis of her father, what she at once suggested to me were the mannerisms, in thought and speech, of the poor old music-master. Indeed, his photograph was nothing; what she really desecrated, what she corrupted into ministering to her pleasures, but what remained between them and her and prevented her from any direct enjoyment of them, was the likeness between her face and his, his mother's blue eyes which he had handed down to her, like some trinket to be kept in the family, those little friendly movements and inclinations which set up between the viciousness of Mlle. Vinteuil and herself a phraseology, a mentality not designed for vice, which made her regard it as not in any way different from the numberless little social duties and courtesies to which she must devote herself every day. It was not evil that gave her the idea of pleasure, that seemed to her attractive; it was pleasure, rather, that seemed evil. And as, every time that she indulged in it, pleasure came to her attended by evil thoughts such as, ordinarily, had no place in her virtuous mind , she came at length to see in pleasure itself something diabolical, to identify it with Evil. Perhaps Mlle. Vinteuil felt that at heart her friend was not altogether bad, not really sincere when she gave vent to those blasphemous utterances. At any rate, she had the pleasure of receiving those kisses on her brow, those smiles, those glances; all feigned, perhaps, but akin in their base and vicious mode of expression to those which would have been discernible on the face of a creature formed not out of kindness and long-suffering, but out of self-indulgence and cruelty. She was able to delude herself for a moment into believing that she was indeed amusing herself in the way in which, with so unnatural an accomplice, a girl might amuse herself who really did experience that savage antipathy towards her father's memory. Perhaps she would not have thought of wickedness as a state so rare, so abnormal, so exotic, one which it was so refreshing to visit, had she been able to distinguish in herself, as in all her fellow-men and women, that indifference to the sufferings which they cause which, whatever names else be given it, is the one true, terrible and lasting form of cruelty."

Sincèrement je ne vous gêne pas ? Voyez, il y a un peu… je pense que c’est du pollen qui s’est répandu sur vous ; vous permettez que je l’essuie avec ma main ? Je ne vais pas trop fort, je ne suis pas trop brutal ? Je vous chatouille peut-être un peu ? mais c’est que je ne voudrais pas toucher le velours de la robe pour ne pas le friper.

Honestly, I don't bother you? See, there's a little... I guess it's pollen got on you; will you allow me to wipe it with my hand? Am I not going too hard, am I not being too brutal? Am I tickling you a little? but that's because I wouldn't want to touch the velvet of the dress so as not to wrinkle it.

I don’t want to touch the velvet of your dress, I’m afraid I might crush it. But look, it really was necessary to fasten them, they would have fallen; and this way, by pushing them in a little myself . . .","But he, chilled a little by her answer, perhaps, also, to bear out the pretence that he had been sincere in adopting the stratagem, or even because he was already beginning to believe that he had been, exclaimed: ""No, no; you mustn't speak. You will be out of breath again. You can easily answer in signs; I shall understand. Really and truly now, you don't mind my doing this? Look, there is a little —I think it must be pollen, spilt over your dress,—may I brush it off with my hand? That's not too hard; I'm not hurting you, am I? I'm tickling you, perhaps, a little; but I don't want to touch the velvet in case I rub it the wrong way. But, don't you see, I really had to fasten the flowers; they would have fallen out if I hadn't. Like that, now; if I just push them a little farther down...."

"Et comme Eulalie savait avec cela comme personne distraire ma tante sans la fatiguer, ses visites qui avaient lieu régulièrement tous les dimanches sauf empêchement inopiné, étaient pour ma tante un plaisir dont la perspective l’entretenait ces jours-là dans un état agréable d’abord, mais bien vite douloureux comme une faim excessive, pour peu qu’Eulalie fût en retard. Trop prolongée, cette volupté d’attendre Eulalie tournait en supplice, ma tante ne cessait de regarder l’heure, bâillait, se sentait des faiblesses.","And since Eulalie knew how to distract my aunt like no one else without tiring her, her visits, which took place regularly every Sunday unless unexpectedly prevented, were a pleasure for my aunt, the prospect of which kept her on those days in a pleasant state of first, but quickly painful like excessive hunger, if Eulalie was late.

For, if unduly prolonged, the rapture of waiting for Eulalie became a torture, and my aunt would never cease from looking at the time, and yawning, and complaining of each of her symptoms in turn."
"J’aurais dû être heureux : je ne l’étais pas. Il me semblait que ma mère venait de me faire une première concession qui devait lui être douloureuse, que c’était une première abdication de sa part devant l’idéal qu’elle avait conçu pour moi, et que pour la première fois, elle, si courageuse, s’avouait vaincue. Il me semblait que si je venais de remporter une victoire c’était contre elle, que j’avais réussi comme auraient pu faire la maladie, des chagrins, ou l’âge, à détendre sa volonté, à faire fléchir sa raison, et que cette soirée commençait une ère, resterait comme une triste date. Si j’avais osé maintenant, j’aurais dit à maman : « Non je ne veux pas, ne couche pas ici. » Mais je connaissais la sagesse pratique, réaliste comme on dirait aujourd’hui, qui tempérait en elle la nature ardemment idéaliste de ma grand’mère, et je savais que, maintenant que le mal était fait, elle aimerait mieux m’en laisser du moins goûter le plaisir calmant et ne pas déranger mon père. Certes, le beau visage de ma mère brillait encore de jeunesse ce soir-là où elle me tenait si doucement les mains et cherchait à arrêter mes larmes ; mais justement il me semblait que cela n’aurait pas dû être, sa colère eût été moins triste pour moi que cette douceur nouvelle que n’avait pas connue mon enfance ; il me semblait que je venais d’une main impie et secrète de tracer dans son âme une première ride et d’y faire apparaître un premier cheveu blanc. Cette pensée redoubla mes sanglots, et alors je vis maman, qui jamais ne se laissait aller à aucun attendrissement avec moi, être tout d’un coup gagnée par le mien et essayer de retenir une envie de pleurer.","I should have been happy: I was not. It seemed to me that my mother had just made a first concession to me which must have been painful to her, that it was a first abdication on her part before the ideal that she had conceived for me, and that for the first time, she, so brave, admitted defeat. It seemed to me that if I had just won a victory it was against her, that I had succeeded, as illness, grief, or age could have done, in relaxing her will, in making her reason bend, and that this evening was beginning an era, would remain as a sad date. If I had dared now, I would have said to mum: ""No I don't want to, don't sleep here. But I knew the practical wisdom, realistic as we would say today, which tempered in her the ardently idealistic nature of my grandmother, and I knew that, now that the damage was done, she would rather leave some to me. less taste the calming pleasure and not disturb my father. Certainly, my mother's beautiful face still shone with youth that evening when she held my hands so gently and tried to stop my tears; but precisely it seemed to me that it should not have been, his anger would have been less sad for me than this new sweetness that my childhood had not known; it seemed to me that I had just, with an impious and secret hand, traced a first wrinkle in his soul and caused a first white hair to appear there. This thought redoubled my sobs, and then I saw Mama, who never allowed herself to be tender with me, suddenly won over by mine and trying to hold back a desire to cry.","I ought to have been happy: I was not. It seemed to me that my mother had just made me a first concession which must have been painful to her, that this was a first abdication on her part from the ideal she had conceived for me, and that for the first time she, who was so courageous, had to confess herself beaten. It seemed to me that, if I had just gained a victory, it was over her, that I had succeeded, as illness, affliction, or age might have done, in relaxing her will, in weakening her judgment, and that this evening was the beginning of a new era, would remain as a sad date. If I had dared, now, I would have said to Mama: “No, I don’t want you to do this, don’t sleep here.” But I was aware of the practical wisdom, the realism as it would be called now, which in her tempered my grandmother’s ardently idealistic nature, and I knew that, now that the harm was done, she would prefer to let me at least enjoy the soothing pleasure of it and not disturb my father. To be sure, my mother’s lovely face still shone with youth that evening when she so gently held my hands and tried to stop my tears; but it seemed to me that this was precisely what should not have been, her anger would have saddened me less than this new gentleness which my childhood had not known before; it seemed to me that with an impious and secret hand I had just traced in her soul a first wrinkle and caused a first white hair to appear. At the thought of this my sobs redoubled, and then I saw that Mama, who never let herself give way to any emotion with me, was suddenly overcome by my own and was trying to suppress a desire to cry.","I ought then to have been happy; I was not.

It struck me that if I had just scored a victory it was over her; that I had succeeded, as sickness or sorrow or age might have succeeded, in relaxing her will, in altering her judgment; that this evening opened a new era, must remain a black date in the calendar. And if I had dared now, I should have said to Mamma: ""No, I don't want you; you mustn't sleep here. "" But I was conscious of the practical wisdom, of what would be called nowadays the realism with which she tempered the ardent idealism of my grandmother's nature, and I knew that now the mischief was done she would prefer to let me enjoy the soothing pleasure of her company, and not to disturb my father again. Certainly my mother's beautiful features seemed to shine again with youth that evening, as she sat gently holding my hands and trying to check my tears; but, just for that reason, it seemed to me that this should not have happened; her anger would have been less difficult to endure than this new kindness which my childhood had not known; I felt that I had with an impious and secret finger traced a first wrinkle upon her soul and made the first white hair shew upon her head. This thought redoubled my sobs, and then I saw that Mamma, who had never allowed herself to go to any length of tenderness with me, was suddenly overcome by my tears and had to struggle to keep back her own."

"Une ou deux fois par mois, à Paris, on m’envoyait lui faire une visite, comme il finissait de déjeuner, en simple vareuse, servi par son domestique en veste de travail de coutil rayé violet et blanc. Il se plaignait en ronchonnant que je n’étais pas venu depuis longtemps, qu’on l’abandonnait ; il m’offrait un massepain ou une mandarine, nous traversions un salon dans lequel on ne s’arrêtait jamais, où on ne faisait jamais de feu, dont les murs étaient ornés de moulures dorées, les plafonds peints d’un bleu qui prétendait imiter le ciel et les meubles capitonnés en satin comme chez mes grands-parents, mais jaune ; puis nous passions dans ce qu’il appelait son cabinet de « travail » aux murs duquel étaient accrochées de ces gravures représentant sur fond noir une déesse charnue et rose conduisant un char, montée sur un globe, ou une étoile au front, qu’on aimait sous le second Empire parce qu’on leur trouvait un air pompéien, puis qu’on détesta, et qu’on recommence à aimer pour une seule et même raison, malgré les autres qu’on donne, et qui est qu’elles ont l’air second Empire. Et je restais avec mon oncle jusqu’à ce que son valet de chambre vînt lui demander, de la part du cocher, pour quelle heure celui-ci devait atteler. Mon oncle se plongeait alors dans une méditation qu’aurait craint de troubler d’un seul mouvement son valet de chambre émerveillé, et dont il attendait avec curiosité le résultat, toujours identique. Enfin, après une hésitation suprême, mon oncle prononçait infailliblement ces mots : « Deux heures et quart », que le valet de chambre répétait avec étonnement, mais sans discuter : « Deux heures et quart ? bien… je vais le dire…","Once or twice a month, in Paris, I was sent to pay him a visit, just as he was finishing lunch, in a simple jacket, served by his servant in a work jacket of purple and white striped drill. He complained grumblingly that I hadn't come for a long time, that he was being abandoned; he offered me a marzipan or a tangerine, we passed through a living room in which we never stopped, where we never made a fire, whose walls were adorned with gilded moldings, the ceilings painted a blue which claimed to imitate the sky and the upholstered furniture in satin like at my grandparents', but yellow; then we went into what he called his ""work"" study, on the walls of which were hung these engravings representing on a black background a plump and pink goddess driving a chariot, mounted on a globe, or a star on the forehead, which we loved under the Second Empire because we found them to have a Pompeian air, then we hated, and we start to love again for one and the same reason, despite the others we give, and which is that they have Second Empire look. And I stayed with my uncle until his valet came to ask him, on behalf of the coachman, what time he was to hitch up. My uncle then plunged into a meditation that his amazed valet would have feared to disturb with a single movement, and of which he awaited with curiosity the result, always identical. Finally, after a supreme hesitation, my uncle infallibly uttered these words: “Quarter past two,” which the valet repeated with astonishment, but without discussion: “Quarter two? ok...i'll say it...","Once or twice a month, in Paris, I used to be sent to pay him a visit as he was finishing lunch wearing a plain loose-fitting jacket and waited on by his servant who was dressed in a work jacket of striped duck, violet and white.

And I would stay with my uncle until his valet came to him from the coachman to ask what time the latter should harness up. My uncle would then sink into a deep meditation while his admiring valet, afraid of disturbing him by the slightest movement, waited curiously for the result, which was always identical. At last, after the greatest hesitation, my uncle would unfailingly utter these words: “At quarter past two,” which the valet would repeat with surprise, but without disputing them: “At quarter past two?

And there I would stay with my uncle until his man came, with a message from the coachman, to ask him at what time he would like the carriage. My uncle would then be lost in meditation, while his astonished servant stood there, not daring to disturb him by the least movement, wondering and waiting for his answer, which never varied. For in the end, after a supreme crisis of hesitation, my uncle would utter, infallibly, the words: ""A quarter past two,"" which the servant would echo with amazement, but without disputing them: ""A quarter past two!

"J’étais au contraire enchanté et maman alla chercher un paquet de livres dont je ne pus deviner, à travers le papier qui les enveloppait, que la taille courte et large, mais qui, sous ce premier aspect, pourtant sommaire et voilé, éclipsaient déjà la boîte à couleurs du Jour de l’An et les vers à soie de l’an dernier. C’était la Mare au Diable, François le Champi, la Petite Fadette et les Maîtres Sonneurs. Ma grand’mère, ai-je su depuis, avait d’abord choisi les poésies de Musset, un volume de Rousseau et Indiana ; car si elle jugeait les lectures futiles aussi malsaines que les bonbons et les pâtisseries, elles ne pensait pas que les grands souffles du génie eussent sur l’esprit même d’un enfant une influence plus dangereuse et moins vivifiante que sur son corps le grand air et le vent du large. Mais mon père l’ayant presque traitée de folle en apprenant les livres qu’elle voulait me donner, elle était retournée elle-même à Jouy-le-Vicomte chez le libraire pour que je ne risquasse pas de ne pas avoir mon cadeau (c’était un jour brûlant et elle était rentrée si souffrante que le médecin avait averti ma mère de ne pas la laisser se fatiguer ainsi) et elle s’était rabattue sur les quatre romans champêtres de George Sand.","On the contrary, I was enchanted and Mama went to fetch a bundle of books of which I could only guess, through the paper which wrapped them, the size short and wide, but which, under this first aspect, however summary and veiled, already eclipsed the New Year's Day color box and last year's silkworms. It was the Mare au Diable, François le Champi, the Petite Fadette and the Maîtres Sonneurs. My grandmother, as I learned since, had first chosen the poems of Musset, a volume of Rousseau and Indiana; for if she considered trivial reading as unhealthy as sweets and pastries, she did not think that the great breaths of genius had a more dangerous and less vivifying influence on the very mind of a child than on his body the open air. and the offshore wind. But my father having almost called her crazy when she learned of the books she wanted to give me, she had gone back to Jouy-le-Vicomte herself to the bookseller so that I wouldn't risk not having my present (c It was a hot day and she had come home so ill that the doctor had warned my mother not to let her get so tired) and she had fallen back on George Sand's four country novels.","On the contrary, I was delighted, and Mama went to get a packet of books, of which I could not distinguish, through the paper in which they were wrapped, more than their shape, short and thick, but which, in this first guise, though summary and veiled, already eclipsed the box of colors from New Year’s Day and the silkworms from last year. They were La Mare au Diable, François le Champi, La Petite Fadette, and Les Maîtres Sonneurs. My grandmother, as I learned afterward, had first chosen the poems of Musset, a volume of Rousseau, and Indiana;29 for though she judged frivolous reading to be as unhealthy as sweets and pastries, it did not occur to her that a great breath of genius might have a more dangerous and less invigorating influence on the mind even of a child than would the open air and the sea breeze on his body. But as my father had nearly called her mad when he learned which books she wanted to give me, she had returned to the bookstore in Jouy-le-Vicomte herself, so that I would not risk not having my present (it was a burning-hot day and she had come home so indisposed that the doctor had warned my mother not to let her tire herself out that way again) and she had resorted to the four pastoral novels of George Sand.","I was only too delighted, and Mamma went to find a parcel of books in which I could not distinguish, through the paper in which it was wrapped, any more than its squareness and size, but which, even at this first glimpse, brief and obscure as it was, bade fair to eclipse already the paint-box of last New Year's Day and the silkworms of the year before. It contained La Mare au Diable, François le Champi, La Petite Fadette, and Les Maîtres Sonneurs. My grandmother, as I learned afterwards, had at first chosen Mussel's poems, a volume of Rousseau, and Indiana; for while she considered light reading as unwholesome as sweets and cakes, she did not reflect that the strong breath of genius must have upon the very soul of a child an influence at once more dangerous and less quickening than those of fresh air and country breezes upon his body. But when my father had seemed almost to regard her as insane on learning the names of the books she proposed to give me, she had journeyed back by herself to Jouy-le-Vicomte to the bookseller's, so that there should be no fear of my not having my present in time (it was a burning hot day, and she had come home so unwell that the doctor had warned my mother not to allow her again to tire herself in that way), and had there fallen back upon the four pastoral novels of George Sand."

My heart beat with impatience when I thought that it was going to be another moment before all these people, in the midst of whom I noticed with desolation that he was not a mulatto banker by whom I felt despised, saw the young man stranger to whom they paid no attention, to greet (without knowing her, to tell the truth, but I thought I was authorized to do so because my parents knew her husband and I was her daughter's comrade), this woman whose reputation as beauty, misconduct and elegance was universal.","Though I could not hear these comments, I did perceive all around her the indistinct murmur of celebrity. My heart raced with impatience at the thought that yet another instant was going to pass before the moment when all these people, among whom I was disconsolate not to find a certain mulatto banker by whom I felt I was despised, would see the young stranger to whom they had paid no attention bow (without knowing her, in fact, but I felt I was authorized to do so because my parents knew her husband and I was her daughter’s playmate) to that woman whose reputation for beauty, improper behavior, and elegance was universal.","Without listening to these memories, I could feel all about her the indistinct murmur of fame. My heart leaped with impatience when I thought that a few seconds must still elapse before all these people, among whom I was dismayed not to find a certain mulatto banker who (or so I felt) had a contempt for me, were to see the unknown youth, to whom they had not, so far, been paying the slightest attention, salute (without knowing her, it was true, but I thought that I had sufficient authority since my parents knew her husband and I was her daughter's playmate) this woman whose reputation for beauty, for misconduct, and for elegance was universal."
"– Voilà le salut passé ! Eulalie ne viendra plus, soupirait ma tante ; ce sera le temps qui lui aura fait peur.","""Here is the past salvation!"" Eulalie won't come any more, sighed my aunt; it will be the weather that will have frightened him.","The Benediction is over! Eulalie won’t be coming,” sighed my aunt; “the weather must have frightened her away.”","""There's Benediction over! Eulalie will never come now,"" sighed my aunt. ""It will be the weather that's frightened her away."""
"Le coup de sonnette d’Eulalie, s’il arrivait tout à la fin de la journée, quand elle ne l’espérait plus, la faisait presque se trouver mal. En réalité, le dimanche, elle ne pensait qu’à cette visite et sitôt le déjeuner fini, Françoise avait hâte que nous quittions la salle à manger pour qu’elle pût monter « occuper » ma tante. Mais (surtout à partir du moment où les beaux jours s’installaient à Combray) il y avait bien longtemps que l’heure altière de midi, descendue de la tour de Saint-Hilaire qu’elle armoriait des douze fleurons momentanés de sa couronne sonore, avait retenti autour de notre table, auprès du pain bénit venu lui aussi familièrement en sortant de l’église, quand nous étions encore assis devant les assiettes des Mille et une Nuits, appesantis par la chaleur et surtout par le repas. Car, au fond permanent d’œufs, de côtelettes, de pommes de terre, de confitures, de biscuits, qu’elle ne nous annonçait même plus, Françoise ajoutait – selon les travaux des champs et des vergers, le fruit de la marée, les hasards du commerce, les politesses des voisins et son propre génie, et si bien que notre menu, comme ces quatre-feuilles qu’on sculptait au XIIIe siècle au portail des cathédrales, reflétait un peu le rythme des saisons et des épisodes de la vie – : une barbue parce que la marchande lui en avait garanti la fraîcheur, une dinde parce qu’elle en avait vu une belle au marché de Roussainville-le-Pin, des cardons à la moelle parce qu’elle ne nous en avait pas encore fait de cette manière-là, un gigot rôti parce que le grand air creuse et qu’il avait bien le temps de descendre d’ici sept heures, des épinards pour changer, des abricots parce que c’était encore une rareté, des groseilles parce que dans quinze jours il n’y en aurait plus, des framboises que M. Swann avait apportées exprès, des cerises, les premières qui vinssent du cerisier du jardin après deux ans qu’il n’en donnait plus, du fromage à la crème que j’aimais bien autrefois, un gâteau aux amandes parce qu’elle l’avait commandé la veille, une brioche parce que c’était notre tour de l’offrir. Quand tout cela était fini, composée expressément pour nous, mais dédiée plus spécialement à mon père qui était amateur, une crème au chocolat, inspiration, attention personnelle de Françoise, nous était offerte, fugitive et légère comme une œuvre de circonstance où elle avait mis tout son talent. Celui qui eût refusé d’en goûter en disant : « J’ai fini, je n’ai plus faim », se serait immédiatement ravalé au rang de ces goujats qui, même dans le présent qu’un artiste leur fait d’une de ses œuvres, regardent au poids et à la matière alors que n’y valent que l’intention et la signature. Même en laisser une seule goutte dans le plat eût témoigné de la même impolitesse que se lever avant la fin du morceau au nez du compositeur.","Eulalie's ringing of the doorbell, if it came at the very end of the day, when she no longer hoped for it, almost made her faint. In reality, on Sunday, she only thought of this visit and as soon as lunch was over, Françoise was in a hurry for us to leave the dining room so that she could go upstairs to “occupy” my aunt. But (especially from the moment when the beautiful days settled in Combray) it had been a long time since the haughty noon hour, descended from the tower of Saint-Hilaire which it emblazoned with the twelve momentary florets of its sonorous crown , had resounded around our table, near the holy bread that also came familiarly on leaving church, when we were still seated in front of the plates of the Thousand and One Nights, weighed down by the heat and especially by the meal. Because, to the permanent stock of eggs, cutlets, potatoes, jams, biscuits, which she no longer even announced to us, Françoise would add – depending on the work in the fields and orchards, the fruit of the tide, the chances of commerce, the courtesies of neighbors and his own genius, and so much so that our menu, like those four-leaf leaves carved in the thirteenth century on the portals of cathedrals, somewhat reflected the rhythm of the seasons and episodes of the life –: a brill because the vendor had guaranteed it to be fresh, a turkey because she had seen a nice one at the Roussainville-le-Pin market, cardoons because she didn’t have any for us still made that way, a roast lamb because the open air is digging in and he had plenty of time to come down in seven o'clock, spinach for a change, apricots because it was still a rarity, currants because in a fortnight there would be none left, raspberries that Mr. Swann had brought on purpose, cherries, the first that came from the cherry tree in the garden after two years of not giving any, cream cheese that I used to like, an almond cake because she ordered it the day before, a brioche because it was our turn to offer it. When all that was over, composed expressly for us, but dedicated more especially to my father who was an amateur, a chocolate cream, inspiration, personal attention of Françoise, was offered to us, fleeting and light as a work of circumstance in which she had put all his talent. Anyone who had refused to taste it, saying: ""I'm finished, I'm not hungry anymore,"" would have immediately reduced himself to the rank of those cads who, even in the present that an artist gives them with one of his works, look at the weight and the material whereas only the intention and the signature are worth there. Even leaving a single drop in the dish would have shown the same rudeness as getting up before the end of the piece in the composer's face.","The sound of Eulalie’s chime, if it came at the very end of the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would almost make her ill. The fact was that on Sunday, she thought only of this visit, and as soon as lunch was finished, Françoise would be in a hurry for us to leave the dining room so that she could go up and “occupy” my aunt. But (especially once the fine weather settled in at Combray) a good long time would go by after the haughty hour of noon, descending from the Saint-Hilaire steeple, which it had emblazoned with the twelve momentary rosettes of its sonorous crown, had echoed around our table close to the consecrated bread which had also come in, familiarly, after church, while we remained sitting in front of the Thousand and One Nights plates, oppressed by the heat and especially by the meal. For, upon a permanent foundation of eggs, cutlets, potatoes, jams, biscuits which she no longer even announced to us, Françoise would add—depending on the labors in the fields and orchards, the fruit of the tide, the luck of the marketplace, the kindness of neighbors, and her own genius, and with the result that our menu, like the quatrefoils carved on the portals of cathedrals in the thirteenth century, reflected somewhat the rhythm of the seasons and the incidents of daily life—a brill because the monger had guaranteed her that it was fresh, a turkey hen because she had seen a large one at the Roussainville-le-Pin market, cardoons with marrow because she had not made them for us that way before, a roast leg of mutton because fresh air whets the appetite and it would have plenty of time to “descend” in the next seven hours, spinach for a change, apricots because they were still uncommon, gooseberries because in two weeks there would not be any more, raspberries that M. Swann had brought especially, cherries, the first that had come from the cherry tree in the garden after two years in which it had not given any, cream cheese, which I liked very much at one time, an almond cake because she had ordered it the day before, a brioche because it was our turn to present it. When all of that was finished, there came a work of art composed expressly for us, but more particularly dedicated to my father who was so fond of it, a chocolate custard, the product of Françoise’s personal inspiration and attention, ephemeral and light as an occasional piece into which she had put all her talent. If anyone had refused to taste it, saying: “I’m finished, I’m not hungry anymore,” that person would immediately have been relegated to the rank of those barbarians who, even in a gift an artist makes them of one of his works, scrutinize its weight and its material when the only things of value in it are its intention and its signature. To leave even a single drop of it on the plate would have been to display the same impoliteness as to stand up before the end of a piece under the very nose of the composer.","Eulalie's ring, if it sounded from the front door at the very end of the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would almost make her ill. For the fact was that on Sundays she thought of nothing else than this visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended Françoise would become impatient for us to leave the dining-room so that she might go upstairs to 'occupy' my aunt. But—and this more than ever from the day on which fine weather definitely set in at Combray—the proud hour °f noon, descending from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which it blazoned for a moment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown, would long have echoed about our table, beside the 'holy bread,' which too had come in, after church, in its familiar way; and we would still be found seated in front of our Arabian Nights plates, weighed down by the heat of the day, and even more by our heavy meal. For upon the permanent foundation of eggs, cutlets, potatoes, preserves, and biscuits, whose appearance on the table she no longer announced to us, Françoise would add—as the labour of fields and orchards, the harvest of the tides, the luck of the markets, the kindness of neighbours, and her own genius might provide; and so effectively that our bill of fare, like the quatrefoils that were carved on the porches of cathedrals in the thirteenth century, reflected to some extent the march of the seasons and the incidents of human life—a brill, because the fish-woman had guaranteed its freshness; a turkey, because she had seen a beauty in the market at Roussainville-le-Pin; cardoons with marrow, because she had never done them for us in that way before; a roast leg of mutton, because the fresh air made one hungry and there would be plenty of time for it to 'settle down' in the seven hours before dinner; spinach, by way of a change; apricots, because they were still hard to get; gooseberries, because in another fortnight there would be none left; raspberries, which M. Swann had brought specially; cherries, the first to come from the cherry-tree, which had yielded none for the last two years; a cream cheese, of which in those days I was extremely fond; an almond cake, because she had ordered one the evening before; a fancy loaf, because it was our turn to 'offer' the holy bread. And when all these had been eaten, a work composed expressly for ourselves, but dedicated more particularly to my father, who had a fondness for such things, a cream of chocolate, inspired in the mind, created by the hand of Françoise, would be laid before us, light and fleeting as an 'occasional piece' of music, into which she had poured the whole of her talent. Anyone who refused to partake of it, saying: ""No, thank you, I have finished; I am not hungry,"" would at once have been lowered to the level of the Philistines who, when an artist makes them a present of one of his works, examine its weight and material, whereas what is of value is the creator's intention and his signature. To have left even the tiniest morsel in the dish would have shewn as much discourtesy as to rise and leave a concert hall while the 'piece' was still being played, and under the composer's-very eyes."

"Voilà une femme en qui j’avais confiance, qui a l’air si simple, si honnête, en tous cas, si même elle était légère, qui semblait bien normale et saine dans ses goûts : sur une dénonciation invraisemblable, je l’interroge et le peu qu’elle m’avoue révèle bien plus que ce qu’on eût pu soupçonner. » Mais il ne pouvait pas se borner à ces remarques désintéressées. Il cherchait à apprécier exactement la valeur de ce qu’elle lui avait raconté, afin de savoir s’il devait conclure que ces choses, elle les avait faites souvent, qu’elles se renouvelleraient. Il se répétait ces mots qu’elle avait dits : « Je voyais bien où elle voulait en venir », « Deux ou trois fois », « Cette blague ! », mais ils ne reparaissaient pas désarmés dans la mémoire de Swann, chacun d’eux tenait son couteau et lui en portait un nouveau coup. Pendant bien longtemps, comme un malade ne peut s’empêcher d’essayer à toute minute de faire le mouvement qui lui est douloureux, il se redisait ces mots : « Je suis bien ici », « Cette blague ! », mais la souffrance était si forte qu’il était obligé de s’arrêter.","Here is a woman in whom I had confidence, who seemed so simple, so honest, in any case, even if she was slight, who seemed very normal and healthy in her tastes: on an implausible denunciation, I question her and the little she confesses to me reveals much more than one might have suspected. But he could not confine himself to these disinterested remarks. He was trying to appreciate exactly the value of what she had told him, in order to know whether he should conclude that these things, she had done them often, that they would be repeated. He repeated to himself these words she had said: “I could see where she was coming from”, “Two or three times”, “That joke! but they did not reappear disarmed in Swann's memory, each of them holding his knife and dealing him a fresh blow.

He tried to estimate the exact value of what she had told him, in order to know if he ought to conclude that she had done these things often, that they would happen again.

But he could not confine himself to these detached observations. He sought to form an exact estimate of the importance of what she had just told him, so as to know whether he might conclude that she had done these things often, and was likely to do them again. He repeated her words to himself: ""I knew quite well what she was after."" ""Two or three times."" ""I've heard that tale before."" But they did not reappear in his memory unarmed; each of them held a knife with which it stabbed him afresh.

"Et ma tante ne répondait même pas, exhalant un soupir qui semblait devoir être le dernier, les yeux clos, comme morte. Mais à peine Françoise était-elle descendue que quatre coups donnés avec la plus grande violence retentissaient dans la maison et ma tante, dressée sur son lit, criait : – Est-ce qu’Eulalie est déjà partie ?

Et déjà le charme dont son nom avait encensé cette place sous les épines roses où il avait été entendu ensemble par elle et par moi, allait gagner, enduire, embaumer tout ce qui l’approchait, ses grands-parents que les miens avaient eu l’ineffable bonheur de connaître, la sublime profession d’agent de change, le douloureux quartier des Champs-Élysées qu’elle habitait à Paris.","However, I walked away, carrying away forever, as the first type of a happiness inaccessible to children of my kind by natural laws impossible to transgress, the image of a little red-haired girl, with skin strewn with pink spots, who was holding a spade and who was laughing, letting long, sly, expressionless glances pass over me. And already the charm with which his name had incensed this place under the pink thorns where he had been heard together by her and by me, was going to win, coat, embalm all that approached him, his grandparents that mine had had the ineffable happiness to know, the sublime profession of stockbroker, the painful district of the Champs-Élysées where she lived in Paris.","But I went away, carrying with me forever, as the first example of a type of happiness inaccessible to children of my kind because of certain laws of nature impossible to transgress, the image of a little girl with red hair, her skin scattered with pink freckles, holding a spade and smiling as she cast at me long, cunning, and inexpressive glances. And already the charm with which the incense of her name had imbued that place under the pink hawthorns where it had been heard by her and by me together was beginning to reach, to overlay, to perfume everything that came near it, her grandparents, whom my own had had the ineffable happiness of knowing, the sublime profession of stockbroker, the harrowing neighborhood of the Champs-Élysées where she lived in Paris.","However, I walked away, carrying with me, then and for ever afterwards, as the first illustration of a type of happiness rendered inaccessible to a little boy of my kind by certain laws of nature which it was impossible to transgress, the picture of a little girl with reddish hair, and a skin freckled with tiny pink marks, who held a trowel in her hand, and smiled as she directed towards me a long and subtle and inexpressive stare. And already the charm with which her name, like a cloud of incense, had filled that archway in the pink hawthorn through which she and I had, together, heard its sound, was beginning to conquer, to cover, to embalm, to beautify everything with which it had any association: her grandparents, whom my own had been so unspeakably fortunate as to know, the glorious profession of a stockholder, even the melancholy neighbourhood of the Champs-Elysées, where she lived in Paris."
"L’année où nous mangeâmes tant d’asperges, la fille de cuisine habituellement chargée de les « plumer » était une pauvre créature maladive, dans un état de grossesse déjà assez avancé quand nous arrivâmes à Pâques, et on s’étonnait même que Françoise lui laissât faire tant de courses et de besogne, car elle commençait à porter difficilement devant elle la mystérieuse corbeille, chaque jour plus remplie, dont on devinait sous ses amples sarraus la forme magnifique. Ceux-ci rappelaient les houppelandes qui revêtent certaines des figures symboliques de Giotto dont M. Swann m’avait donné des photographies. C’est lui-même qui nous l’avait fait remarquer et quand il nous demandait des nouvelles de la fille de cuisine, il nous disait : « Comment va la Charité de Giotto ? » D’ailleurs elle-même, la pauvre fille, engraissée par sa grossesse, jusqu’à la figure, jusqu’aux joues qui tombaient droites et carrées, ressemblait en effet assez à ces vierges, fortes et hommasses, matrones plutôt, dans lesquelles les vertus sont personnifiées à l’Arena. Et je me rends compte maintenant que ces Vertus et ces Vices de Padoue lui ressemblaient encore d’une autre manière. De même que l’image de cette fille était accrue par le symbole ajouté qu’elle portait devant son ventre, sans avoir l’air d’en comprendre le sens, sans que rien dans son visage en traduisît la beauté et l’esprit, comme un simple et pesant fardeau, de même c’est sans paraître s’en douter que la puissante ménagère qui est représentée à l’Arena au-dessous du nom « Caritas » et dont la reproduction était accrochée au mur de ma salle d’études, à Combray, incarne cette vertu, c’est sans qu’aucune pensée de charité semble avoir jamais pu être exprimée par son visage énergique et vulgaire. Par une belle invention du peintre elle foule aux pieds les trésors de la terre, mais absolument comme si elle piétinait des raisins pour en extraire le jus ou plutôt comme elle aurait monté sur des sacs pour se hausser ; et elle tend à Dieu son cœur enflammé, disons mieux, elle le lui « passe », comme une cuisinière passe un tire-bouchon par le soupirail de son sous-sol à quelqu’un qui le lui demande à la fenêtre du rez-de-chaussée. L’Envie, elle, aurait eu davantage une certaine expression d’envie. Mais dans cette fresque-là encore, le symbole tient tant de place et est représenté comme si réel, le serpent qui siffle aux lèvres de l’Envie est si gros, il lui remplit si complètement sa bouche grande ouverte, que les muscles de sa figure sont distendus pour pouvoir le contenir, comme ceux d’un enfant qui gonfle un ballon avec son souffle, et que l’attention de l’Envie – et la nôtre du même coup – tout entière concentrée sur l’action de ses lèvres, n’a guère de temps à donner à d’envieuses pensées.","The year we ate so many asparagus, the kitchen maid usually in charge of ""plucking"" them was a poor sickly creature, in a fairly advanced state of pregnancy when we arrived at Easter, and we were even surprised that Françoise she would let her do so much shopping and work, for she was beginning to carry with difficulty the mysterious basket in front of her, each day more full, whose magnificent form under her ample smocks you could guess. These were reminiscent of the greatcoats which adorn some of Giotto's symbolic figures of which M. Swann had given me photographs. It was he himself who had pointed this out to us and when he asked us about the kitchen maid, he said to us: “How is Giotto’s Charity? Besides, the poor girl herself, fattened by her pregnancy, down to the face, down to the cheeks which fell straight and square, did indeed resemble those virgins, strong and manly, matrons rather, in whom the virtues are personified at the Arena. And I realize now that these Virtues and Vices of Padua resembled him in yet another way. Just as the image of this girl was heightened by the added symbol she wore in front of her belly, without seeming to understand its meaning, without anything in her face conveying its beauty and spirit, like a simple and heavy burden, just as it is without seeming to suspect it that the powerful housewife who is represented in the Arena under the name ""Caritas"" and whose reproduction was hung on the wall of my meeting room studies, at Combray, embodies this virtue, it is without any thought of charity ever seeming to have been able to be expressed by his energetic and vulgar face. By a beautiful invention of the painter she tramples the treasures of the earth under her feet, but absolutely as if she were trampling grapes to extract their juice or rather as she would have climbed on sacks to raise herself; and she holds out her inflamed heart to God, let's put it better, she ""passes"" it to him, like a cook passes a corkscrew through the vent in her basement to someone who asks her for it at the ground floor window. floor. Envy would have had more of a certain expression of envy. But in this fresco again, the symbol takes up so much space and is represented as so real, the serpent which hisses at Envy's lips is so big, it fills his wide open mouth so completely, that the muscles of his figure are distended to be able to contain it, like those of a child who inflates a balloon with his breath, and that the attention of Envy - and ours at the same time - entirely concentrated on the action of his lips, has little time for envious thoughts.","The year we ate so much asparagus, the kitchen maid usually given the job of “scraping” them was a poor, sickly creature, in a state of pregnancy already rather advanced when we arrived at Easter, and we were in fact surprised that Françoise allowed her to do so many errands and so much heavy work, for she was beginning to have difficulty carrying before her the mysterious basket, rounder every day, whose magnificent form one could divine under her ample smocks. These smocks reminded me of the cloaks worn by certain of Giotto’s symbolic figures, photographs of whom I had been given by M. Swann. He himself was the one who had pointed this out to us and when he asked for news of the kitchen maid he would say: “How is Giotto’s Charity?” What was more, she herself, poor girl, fattened by her pregnancy even in her face, even in her cheeks, which descended straight and square, rather resembled, in fact, those strong, mannish virgins, matrons really, in whom the virtues are personified in the Arena. And I realize now that those Virtues and Vices of Padua12 resembled her in still another way. Just as the image of this girl was increased by the added symbol she carried before her belly without appearing to understand its meaning, without expressing in her face anything of its beauty and spirit, as a mere heavy burden, in the same way the powerful housewife who is represented at the Arena below the name “Caritas,” and a reproduction of whom hung on the wall of my schoolroom at Combray, embodies this virtue without seeming to suspect it, without any thought of charity seeming ever to have been capable of being expressed by her vulgar, energetic face. Through a lovely invention of the painter, she is trampling upon the treasures of the earth, but absolutely as if she were treading grapes to extract their juice or rather as she would have climbed on some sacks to raise herself up; and she holds her flaming heart out to God, or, to put it more exactly, “hands” it to him, as a cook hands a corkscrew through the vent of her cellar to someone who is asking her for it at the ground-floor window. Envy, too, might have had more of a particular expression of envy. But in this fresco too, the symbol occupies such a large place and is represented as so real, the serpent hissing at the lips of Envy is so fat, it fills her wide-open mouth so completely, that the muscles of her face are distended to contain it, like those of a child swelling a balloon with its breath, and that Envy’s attention—and ours along with it—entirely concentrated as it is on the action of her lips, has scarcely any time for envious thoughts.","In the year in which we ate such quantities of asparagus, the kitchen-maid whose duty it was to dress them was a poor sickly creature, some way 'gone' in pregnancy when we arrived at Combray for Easter, and it was indeed surprising that Françoise allowed her to run so many errands in the town and to do so much work in the house, for she was beginning to find a difficulty in bearing before her the mysterious casket, fuller and larger every day, whose splendid outline could be detected through the folds of her ample smocks. These last recalled the cloaks in which Giotto shrouds some of the allegorical figures in his paintings, of which M. Swann had given me photographs. He it was who pointed out the resemblance, and when he inquired after the kitchen-maid he would say: ""Well, how goes it with Giotto's Charity?"" And indeed the poor girl, whose pregnancy had swelled and stoutened every part of her, even to her face, and the vertical, squared outlines of her cheeks, did distinctly suggest those virgins, so strong and mannish as to seem matrons rather, in whom the Virtues are personified in the Arena Chapel. And I can see now that those Virtues and Vices of Padua resembled her in another respect as well. For just as the figure of this girl had been enlarged by the additional symbol which she carried in her body, without appearing to understand what it meant, without any rendering in her facial expression of all its beauty and spiritual significance, but carried as if it were an ordinary and rather heavy burden, so it is without any apparent suspicion of what she is about that the powerfully built housewife who is portrayed in the Arena beneath the label 'Caritas,' and a reproduction of whose portrait hung upon the wall of my schoolroom at Combray, incarnates that virtue, for it seems impossible, that any thought of charity can ever have found expression in her vulgar and energetic face. By a fine stroke of the painter's invention she is tumbling all the treasures of the earth at her feet, but exactly as if she were treading grapes in a wine-press to extract their juice, or, still more, as if she had climbed on a heap of sacks to raise herself higher; and she is holding out her flaming heart to God, or shall we say 'handing' it to Him, exactly as a cook might hand up a corkscrew through the skylight of her underground kitchen to some one who had called down to ask her for it from the ground-level above. The 'Invidia,' again, should have had some look on her face of envy. But in this fresco, too, the symbol occupies so large a place and is represented with such realism; the serpent hissing between the lips of Envy is so huge, and so completely fills her wide-opened mouth that the muscles of her face are strained and contorted, like a child's who is filling a balloon with his breath, and that Envy, and we ourselves for that matter, when we look at her, since all her attention and ours are concentrated on the action of her lips, have no time, almost, to spare for envious thoughts."

"Avec quelle joie mélancolique Swann lui répondait : – Oh ! sapristi non ! je te dirai, je ne peux pas prendre Lorédan quand je vais rue La Pérouse.

"Mais plus loin le courant se ralentit, il traverse une propriété dont l’accès était ouvert au public par celui à qui elle appartenait et qui s’y était complu à des travaux d’horticulture aquatique, faisant fleurir, dans les petits étangs que forme la Vivonne, de véritables jardins de nymphéas. Comme les rives étaient à cet endroit très boisées, les grandes ombres des arbres donnaient à l’eau un fond qui était habituellement d’un vert sombre mais que parfois, quand nous rentrions par certains soirs rassérénés d’après-midi orageux, j’ai vu d’un bleu clair et cru, tirant sur le violet, d’apparence cloisonnée et de goût japonais. Çà et là, à la surface, rougissait comme une fraise une fleur de nymphéa au cœur écarlate, blanc sur les bords. Plus loin, les fleurs plus nombreuses étaient plus pâles, moins lisses, plus grenues, plus plissées, et disposées par le hasard en enroulements si gracieux qu’on croyait voir flotter à la dérive, comme après l’effeuillement mélancolique d’une fête galante, des roses mousseuses en guirlandes dénouées. Ailleurs un coin semblait réservé aux espèces communes qui montraient le blanc et rose proprets de la julienne, lavés comme de la porcelaine avec un soin domestique, tandis qu’un peu plus loin, pressées les unes contre les autres en une véritable plate-bande flottante, on eût dit des pensées des jardins qui étaient venues poser comme des papillons leur ailes bleuâtres et glacées sur l’obliquité transparente de ce parterre d’eau ; de ce parterre céleste aussi : car il donnait aux fleurs un sol d’une couleur plus précieuse, plus émouvante que la couleur des fleurs elles-mêmes ; et, soit que pendant l’après-midi il fît étinceler sous les nymphéas le kaléidoscope d’un bonheur attentif, silencieux et mobile, ou qu’il s’emplît vers le soir, comme quelque port lointain, du rose et de la rêverie du couchant, changeant sans cesse pour rester toujours en accord, autour des corolles de teintes plus fixes, avec ce qu’il y a de plus profond, de plus fugitif, de plus mystérieux – avec ce qu’il y a d’infini – dans l’heure, il semblait les avoir fait fleurir en plein ciel.","But further on the current slows down, it crosses a property whose access was open to the public by the person to whom it belonged and who had enjoyed working there in aquatic horticulture, causing flowers to bloom in the small ponds that form the Vivonne, veritable gardens of water lilies. As the shores were very wooded there, the long shadows of the trees gave the water a background which was usually a dark green but that sometimes, when we returned on certain reassured evenings of stormy afternoons, I I saw a light blue and raw, verging on purple, compartmentalised in appearance and Japanese in taste. Here and there, on the surface, blushed like a strawberry a waterlily flower with a scarlet heart, white at the edges. Further on, the more numerous flowers were paler, less smooth, more grainy, more pleated, and arranged by chance in windings so graceful that one thought one saw floating adrift, as after the melancholy stripping of a gallant feast. , sparkling roses in loose garlands. Elsewhere a corner seemed reserved for the common species which showed the clean white and pink of the julienne, washed like porcelain with domestic care, while a little further on, pressed together in a veritable floating flowerbed , one would have said of the pansies of the gardens which had come to pose like butterflies their bluish and icy wings on the transparent obliquity of this parterre of water; of this celestial parterre also: for it gave to the flowers a soil of a color more precious, more moving than the color of the flowers themselves; and whether in the afternoon it caused the kaleidoscope of attentive, silent and mobile happiness to sparkle under the water lilies, or whether it filled towards evening, like some distant port, with rose and reverie. of the sunset, constantly changing to always remain in harmony, around the corollas of more fixed hues, with what is deepest, most fleeting, most mysterious – with what is infinite – within the hour he seemed to have made them bloom in the sky.","But farther on the current slows down, it crosses an estate to which access was opened to the public by the man who owned it, who had delighted in creating works of aquatic horticulture, turning the little pools formed by the Vivonne into true flowering gardens of white water lilies. Because the banks were heavily wooded here, the trees’ great shadows gave the water a depth that was usually dark green although sometimes, when we came home on an evening that was calm again after a stormy afternoon, I saw that it was a light, raw blue verging on violet, cloisonné in appearance and Japanese in style. Here and there on the surface, the flower of a water lily blushed like a strawberry, with a scarlet heart, white on its edges. Farther off, the more numerous flowers were paler, less smooth, coarser-grained, creased, and grouped by chance in coils so graceful that one thought one saw, floating adrift as after the melancholy dismantling of some gay party, loosened garlands of moss roses. In another place one corner seemed reserved for the various common species, of a tidy white or pink like dame’s rocket, washed clean like porcelain with housewifely care, while a little farther off, others, pressed against one another in a true floating flower border, suggested garden pansies that had come like butterflies to rest their glossy blue-tinged wings on the transparent obliquity of that watery bed; of that celestial bed as well: for it gave the flowers a soil of a color more precious, more affecting than the color of the flowers themselves; and, whether it sparkled beneath the water lilies in the afternoon in a kaleidoscope of silent, watchful, and mobile contentment, or whether toward evening it filled, like some distant port, with the rose and reverie of the sunset, ceaselessly changing so as to remain in harmony, around the more fixed colors of the corollas themselves, with all that is most profound, most fleeting, most mysterious—all that is infinite—in the hour, it seemed to have caused them to flower in the middle of the sky itself.","But farther on the current slackened, where the stream ran through a property thrown open to the public by its owner, who had made a hobby of aquatic gardening, so that the little ponds into which the Vivonne was here diverted were aflower with water-lilies. As the banks at this point were thickly wooded, the heavy shade of the trees gave the water a background which was ordinarily dark green, although sometimes, when we were coming home on a calm evening after a stormy afternoon, I have seen in its depths a clear, crude blue that was almost violet, suggesting a floor of Japanese cloisonné. Here and there, on the surface, floated, blushing like a strawberry, the scarlet heart of a lily set in a ring of white petals. Beyond these the flowers were more frequent, but paler, less glossy, more thickly seeded, more tightly folded, and disposed, by accident, in festoons so graceful that I would fancy I saw floating upon the stream, as though after the dreary stripping of the decorations used in some Watteau festival, moss-roses in loosened garlands. Elsewhere a corner seemed to be reserved for the commoner kinds of lily; of a neat pink or white like rocket-flowers, washed clean like porcelain, with housewifely care; while, a little farther again, were others, pressed close together in a floating garden-bed, as though pansies had flown out of a garden like butterflies and were hovering with blue and burnished wings over the transparent shadowiness of this watery border; this skiey border also, for it set beneath the flowers a soil of a colour more precious, more moving than their own; and both in the afternoon, when it sparkled beneath the lilies in the kaleidoscope of a happiness silent, restless, and alert, and towards evening, when it was filled like a distant heaven with the roseate dreams of the setting sun, incessantly changing and ever remaining in harmony, about the more permanent colour of the flowers themselves, with the utmost profundity, evanescence, and mystery—with a quiet suggestion of infinity; afternoon or evening, it seemed to have set them flowering in the heart of the sky."

But, catching sight of Swann's face, she changed her tone, and: ""You are a fiend!"" she flung at him, ""you enjoy tormenting me, making me tell you lies, just so that you'll leave me in peace."""
"Ils leur ajoutent aussi un charme, une signification qui n’est que pour moi. Quand par les soirs d’été le ciel harmonieux gronde comme une bête fauve et que chacun boude l’orage, c’est au côté de Méséglise que je dois de rester seul en extase à respirer, à travers le bruit de la pluie qui tombe, l’odeur d’invisibles et persistants lilas.","They also add a charm to them, a meaning that is only for me.

"J’avais entendu parler de Bergotte pour la première fois par un de mes camarades plus âgé que moi et pour qui j’avais une grande admiration, Bloch. En m’entendant lui avouer mon admiration pour la Nuit d’Octobre, il avait fait éclater un rire bruyant comme une trompette et m’avait dit : « Défie-toi de ta dilection assez basse pour le sieur de Musset. C’est un coco des plus malfaisants et une assez sinistre brute. Je dois confesser, d’ailleurs, que lui et même le nommé Racine, ont fait chacun dans leur vie un vers assez bien rythmé, et qui a pour lui, ce qui est selon moi le mérite suprême, de ne signifier absolument rien.","I had heard of Bergotte for the first time from one of my comrades older than me and for whom I had great admiration, Bloch. Hearing me confess my admiration for the Nuit d'Octobre, he let out a loud laugh like a trumpet and said to me: ""Beware of your rather low love for the Sieur de Musset. He is one of the most evil commies and quite a sinister brute. I must confess, moreover, that he and even the man named Racine, have each written in their lives a rather well-paced verse, and which has for him, which is in my opinion the supreme merit, of signifying absolutely nothing.","I had heard Bergotte mentioned for the first time by a friend of mine older than I whom I greatly admired, Bloch. When he heard me admit how much I admired “La Nuit d’Octobre,”13 he had exploded in laughter as noisy as a trumpet and said to me: “Beware this rather low fondness of yours for the Honorable de Musset. He’s an extremely pernicious individual and a rather sinister brute. I must admit, however, that he and even our man Racine did, each of them, in the course of their lives, make one fairly rhythmical line of verse that also has in its favor what I believe to be the supreme merit of meaning absolutely nothing.","I had heard Bergotte spoken of, for the first time, by a friend older than myself, for whom I had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the name of Bloch. Hearing me confess my love of the Nuit d'Octobre, he had burst out in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me, by way of warning: ""You must conquer your vile taste for A. de Musset, Esquire. He is a bad egg, one of the very worst, a pretty detestable specimen. I am bound to admit, natheless,"" he added graciously, ""that he, and even the man Racine, did, each of them, once in his life, compose a line which is not only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is in my eyes the supreme merit of meaning absolutely nothing."
"Elle avait disparu. Swann savait qu’elle reparaîtrait à la fin du dernier mouvement, après tout un long morceau que le pianiste de MmeVerdurin sautait toujours. Il y avait là d’admirables idées que Swann n’avait pas distinguées à la première audition et qu’il percevait maintenant, comme si elles se fussent, dans le vestiaire de sa mémoire, débarrassées du déguisement uniforme de la nouveauté. Swann écoutait tous les thèmes épars qui entreraient dans la composition de la phrase, comme les prémisses dans la conclusion nécessaire, il assistait à sa genèse. « Ô audace aussi géniale peut-être, se disait-il, que celle d’un Lavoisier, d’un Ampère, l’audace d’un Vinteuil expérimentant, découvrant les lois secrètes d’une force inconnue, menant à travers l’inexploré, vers le seul but possible, l’attelage invisible auquel il se fie et qu’il n’apercevra jamais. » Le beau dialogue que Swann entendit entre le piano et le violon au commencement du dernier morceau ! La suppression des mots humains, loin d’y laisser régner la fantaisie, comme on aurait pu croire, l’en avait éliminée ; jamais le langage parlé ne fut si inflexiblement nécessité, ne connut à ce point la pertinence des questions, l’évidence des réponses. D’abord le piano solitaire se plaignit, comme un oiseau abandonné de sa compagne ; le violon l’entendit, lui répondit comme d’un arbre voisin. C’était comme au commencement du monde, comme s’il n’y avait encore eu qu’eux deux sur la terre, ou plutôt dans ce monde fermé à tout le reste, construit par la logique d’un créateur et où ils ne seraient jamais que tous les deux : cette sonate. Est-ce un oiseau, est-ce l’âme incomplète encore de la petite phrase, est-ce une fée, invisible et gémissant, dont le piano ensuite redisait tendrement la plainte ? Ses cris étaient si soudains que le violoniste devait se précipiter sur son archet pour les recueillir.","She had disappeared. Swann knew she would reappear at the end of the last movement, after a whole long piece which Madame Verdurin's pianist was always skipping. There were admirable ideas there which Swann had not distinguished at the first hearing and which he perceived now, as if they had been, in the cloakroom of his memory, rid of the uniform disguise of novelty. Swann listened to all the scattered themes that would enter into the composition of the sentence, like the premises in the necessary conclusion, he was present at its genesis. “O audacity as brilliant perhaps, he said to himself, as that of a Lavoisier, of an Ampère, the audacity of a Vinteuil experimenting, discovering the secret laws of an unknown force, leading through the unexplored, towards the only possible goal, the invisible team in which he trusts and which he will never perceive. » The beautiful dialogue that Swann heard between the piano and the violin at the beginning of the last piece! The suppression of human words, far from letting fantasy reign there, as one might have thought, had eliminated it; Never has spoken language been so inflexibly necessary, never known to such an extent the relevance of the questions, the evidence of the answers. First the solitary piano complained, like a bird abandoned by its companion; the violin heard him, answered him as if from a nearby tree. It was like at the beginning of the world, as if there had still been only the two of them on earth, or rather in this world closed to everything else, built by the logic of a creator and where they would only ever be both: this sonata. Is it a bird, is it the still incomplete soul of the little phrase, is it a fairy, invisible and moaning, whose lament the piano then tenderly repeated? Its cries were so sudden that the violinist had to rush to his bow to collect them.","It had disappeared. Swann knew that it would reappear at the end of the last movement, after a whole long passage that Mme. Verdurin’s pianist always skipped.

"" Audacity,"" he exclaimed to himself, ""as inspired, perhaps, as a Lavoisier's or an Ampere's, the audacity of a Vinteuil making experiment, discovering the secret laws that govern an unknown force, driving across a region unexplored towards the one possible goal the invisible team in which he has placed his trust and which he never may discern!"" How charming the dialogue which Swann now heard between piano and violin, at the beginning of the last passage. The suppression of human speech, so far from letting fancy reign there uncontrolled (as one might have thought), had eliminated it altogether. Never was spoken language of such inflexible necessity, never had it known questions so pertinent, such obvious replies. At first the piano complained alone, like a bird deserted by its mate; the violin heard and answered it, as from a neighbouring tree. It was as at the first beginning of the world, as if there were not yet but these twain upon the earth, or rather in this world closed against all the rest, so fashioned by the logic of its creator that in it there should never be any but themselves; the world of this sonata. Was it a bird, was it the soul, not yet made perfect, of the little phrase, was it a fairy, invisibly somewhere lamenting, whose plaint the piano heard and tenderly repeated? Its cries were so sudden that the violinist must snatch up his bow and race to catch them as they came."
"Cependant le pianiste redoublant de vitesse, l’émotion musicale était à son comble, un domestique passait des rafraîchissements sur un plateau et faisait tinter des cuillers et, comme chaque semaine, Mme de Saint-Euverte lui faisait, sans qu’il la vît, des signes de s’en aller. Une nouvelle mariée, à qui on avait appris qu’une jeune femme ne doit pas avoir l’air blasé, souriait de plaisir, et cherchait des yeux la maîtresse de maison pour lui témoigner par son regard sa reconnaissance d’avoir « pensé à elle » pour un pareil régal. Pourtant, quoique avec plus de calme que Mme de Franquetot, ce n’est pas sans inquiétude qu’elle suivait le morceau ; mais la sienne avait pour objet, au lieu du pianiste, le piano sur lequel une bougie tressautant à chaque fortissimo risquait, sinon de mettre le feu à l’abat-jour, du moins de faire des taches sur le palissandre. À la fin elle n’y tint plus et, escaladant les deux marches de l’estrade, sur laquelle était placé le piano, se précipita pour enlever la bobèche. Mais à peine ses mains allaient-elles la toucher que, sur un dernier accord, le morceau finit et le pianiste se leva. Néanmoins l’initiative hardie de cette jeune femme, la courte promiscuité qui en résulta entre elle et l’instrumentiste, produisirent une impression généralement favorable.","However, the pianist redoubled his speed, the musical emotion was at its height, a servant passed refreshments on a tray and clinked spoons and, as every week, Mme de Saint-Euverte gave him, without his seeing her, signs of going away. A new bride, who had been taught that a young woman should not look jaded, smiled with pleasure, and looked around for the mistress of the house to show her with her eyes her gratitude for having ""thought of her. for such a treat. However, although with more calm than Madame de Franquetot, it was not without anxiety that she followed the piece; but his had for its object, instead of the pianist, the piano on which a candle quivering at each fortissimo risked, if not setting fire to the lampshade, at least making stains on the rosewood. In the end she couldn't stand it any longer and, climbing the two steps of the platform on which the piano was placed, rushed to remove the bobèche. But no sooner had his hands touched it than, on a final chord, the piece ended and the pianist stood up. Nevertheless, the bold initiative of this young woman, the brief promiscuity that resulted between her and the instrumentalist, produced a generally favorable impression.","Meanwhile, the pianist having redoubled his speed, the musical emotion was at its height, a servant was passing refreshments on a tray and making the spoons clink, and, as happened every week, Mme. de Saint-Euverte signaled to him without his seeing her, to go away. A newlywed, who had been taught that a young woman must not appear bored, smiled with pleasure, and tried to catch the hostess’s eye in order to send her a look of gratitude for having “thought of her” for such a treat. However, although she remained calmer than Mme. de Franquetot , it was not without some uneasiness that she followed the music; but the object of her uneasiness was, not the pianist, but the piano, on which a candle jumping with each fortissimo risked, if not setting its shade on fire, at least spotting the Brazilian rosewood. In the end she could not bear it any longer and, scaling the two steps of the dais on which the piano was placed, swooped down to remove the sconce. But her hands were just about to touch it when, with a final chord, the piece ended and the pianist stood up. Nevertheless the young woman’s bold initiative, the resulting brief promiscuity between her and the instrumentalist, produced a generally favorable impression.","Meanwhile, the pianist having doubled his speed, the emotion of the music-lovers was reaching its climax, a servant was handing refreshments about on a salver, and was making the spoons rattle, and, as on every other 'party-night', Mme. de Saint-Euverte was making signs to him, which he never saw, to leave the room. A recent bride, who had been told that a young woman ought never to appear bored, was smiling vigorously, trying to catch her hostess's eye so as to flash a token of her gratitude for the other's having 'thought of her' in connection with so delightful an entertainment. And yet, although she remained more calm than Mme. de Franquetot , it was not without some uneasiness that she followed the flying fingers; what alarmed her being not the pianist's fate but the piano's, on which a lighted candle, jumping at each fortissimo, threatened, if not to set its shade on fire, at least to spill wax upon the ebony. At last she could contain herself no longer, and, running up the two steps of the platform on which the piano stood, flung herself on the candle to adjust its sconce. But scarcely had her hand come within reach of it when, on a final chord, the piece finished, and the pianist rose to his feet. Nevertheless the bold initiative shewn by this young woman and the moment of blushing confusion between her and the pianist which resulted from it, produced an impression that was favourable on the whole."

"Mais quand sur le chemin du retour j’avais aperçu sur la gauche une ferme, assez distante de deux autres qui étaient au contraire très rapprochées, et à partir de laquelle pour entrer dans Combray il n’y avait plus qu’à prendre une allée de chênes bordée d’un côté de prés appartenant chacun à un petit clos et plantés à intervalles égaux de pommiers qui y portaient, quand ils étaient éclairés par le soleil couchant, le dessin japonais de leurs ombres, brusquement mon cœur se mettait à battre, je savais qu’avant une demi-heure nous serions rentrés, et que, comme c’était de règle les jours où nous étions allés du côté de Guermantes et où le dîner était servi plus tard, on m’enverrait me coucher sitôt ma soupe prise, de sorte que ma mère, retenue à table comme s’il y avait du monde à dîner, ne monterait pas me dire bonsoir dans mon lit. La zone de tristesse où je venais d’entrer était aussi distincte de la zone où je m’élançais avec joie il y avait un moment encore que dans certains ciels une bande rose est séparée comme par une ligne d’une bande verte ou d’une bande noire. On voit un oiseau voler dans le rose, il va en atteindre la fin, il touche presque au noir, puis il y est entré. Les désirs qui tout à l’heure m’entouraient, d’aller à Guermantes, de voyager, d’être heureux, j’étais maintenant tellement en dehors d’eux que leur accomplissement ne m’eût fait aucun plaisir. Comme j’aurais donné tout cela pour pouvoir pleurer toute la nuit dans les bras de maman ! Je frissonnais, je ne détachais pas mes yeux angoissés du visage de ma mère, qui n’apparaîtrait pas ce soir dans la chambre où je me voyais déjà par la pensée, j’aurais voulu mourir. Et cet état durerait jusqu’au lendemain, quand les rayons du matin, appuyant, comme le jardinier, leurs barreaux au mur revêtu de capucines qui grimpaient jusqu’à ma fenêtre, je sauterais à bas du lit pour descendre vite au jardin, sans plus me rappeler que le soir ramènerait jamais l’heure de quitter ma mère. Et de la sorte c’est du côté de Guermantes que j’ai appris à distinguer ces états qui se succèdent en moi, pendant certaines périodes, et vont jusqu’à se partager chaque journée, l’un revenant chasser l’autre, avec la ponctualité de la fièvre ; contigus, mais si extérieurs l’un à l’autre, si dépourvus de moyens de communication entre eux, que je ne puis plus comprendre, plus même me représenter, dans l’un, ce que j’ai désiré, ou redouté, ou accompli dans l’autre.","But when on the way back I had seen a farm on the left, quite distant from two others which were on the contrary very close together, and from which to enter Combray there was only to take an alley of oaks bordered on one side by meadows, each belonging to a small enclosure and planted at equal intervals with apple trees which bore there, when they were lit by the setting sun, the Japanese design of their shadows, suddenly my heart began to beat, I knew that before half an hour we would be back, and that, as was the rule on the days when we had gone towards Guermantes and when dinner was served later, they would send me to bed as soon as my soup taken, so that my mother, kept at the table as if there were people at dinner, would not come up to my bed to say goodnight. The zone of sadness into which I had just entered was as distinct from the zone into which I was rushing with joy. There was still a moment that in certain skies a pink band is separated as by a line from a green band or a black band. We see a bird flying in the pink, it will reach the end of it, it almost touches black, then it has entered it. The desires that surrounded me just now, to go to Guermantes, to travel, to be happy, I was now so outside of them that their fulfillment would have given me no pleasure. How I would have given all that to be able to cry all night in mother's arms! I shivered, I did not take my anguished eyes away from my mother's face, who would not appear this evening in the room where I already saw myself in thought, I would have liked to die. And this state would last until the next day, when the morning rays, resting, like the gardener, their bars on the wall covered with nasturtiums that climbed up to my window, I would jump out of bed to go down quickly to the garden, no more. reminding myself that the evening would never bring back the time to leave my mother. And in this way it was from Guermantes that I learned to distinguish these states which follow one another in me, during certain periods, and go so far as to share each day, one returning to drive out the other, with the punctuality of the fever; contiguous, but so external to each other, so deprived of means of communication between them, that I can no longer understand, no longer even represent myself, in one, what I have desired, or feared, or accomplished in the other.","But when on the way back I saw on the left a farm which was fairly distant from two others very close to each other, and from which, in order to enter Combray, one had only to go down an avenue of oaks bordered on one side by meadows, each of which was part of a little enclosure and was planted at equal intervals with apple trees that wore, when they were lit by the setting sun, the Japanese design of their shadows, my heart would abruptly begin to beat faster, I would know that within half an hour we would be home and that, as was the rule on the days when we had gone the Guermantes way and dinner was served later, they would send me to bed as soon as I had had my soup, so that my mother, kept at the table as though there were company for dinner, would not come up to say goodnight to me in my bed. The region of sadness I had just entered was as distinct from the region into which I had hurled myself with such joy only a moment before, as in certain skies a band of pink is separated as though by a line from a band of green or black. One sees a bird fly into the pink, it is about to reach the end of it , it is nearly touching the black, then it has entered it. The desires that had surrounded me a short time ago, to go to Guermantes, to travel, to be happy, were so far behind me now that their fulfillment would not have brought me any pleasure. How I would have given all that up in order to be able to cry all night in Mama’s arms! I was trembling, I did not take my anguished eyes off my mother’s face, which would not be appearing that evening in the room where I could already see myself in my thoughts, I wanted to die. And that state of mind would continue until the following day, when the morning rays, like the gardener, would lean their bars against the wall clothed in nasturtiums that climbed up to my window, and I would jump out of bed to hurry down into the garden, without remembering, now, that evening would ever bring back with it the hour for leaving my mother. And so it was from the Guermantes way that I learned to distinguish those states of mind that follow one another in me, during certain periods, and that even go so far as to share out each day among them, one returning to drive out the other, with the punctuality of a fever; contiguous, but so exterior to one another, so lacking in means of communication among them, that I can no longer comprehend, no longer even picture to myself in one, what I desired, or dreaded, or accomplished in the other.","But when, on our way home, I had caught sight of a farm, on the left of the road, at some distance from two other farms which were themselves close together, and from which, to return to Combray, we need only turn down an avenue of oaks, bordered on one side by a series of orchard-closes, each one planted at regular intervals with apple-trees which cast upon the ground, when they were lighted by the setting sun, the Japanese stencil of their shadows; then, sharply, my heart would begin to beat, I would know that in half an hour we should be at home, and that there, as was the rule on days when we had taken the 'Guermantes way' and dinner was, in consequence, served later than usual, I should be sent to bed as soon as I had swallowed my soup, so that my mother, kept at table, just as though there had been company to dinner, would not come upstairs to say good night to me in bed. The zone of melancholy which I then entered was totally distinct from that other zone, in which I had been bounding for joy a moment earlier, just as sometimes in the sky a band of pink is separated, as though by a line invisibly ruled, from a band of green or black. You may see a bird flying across the pink; it draws near the border-line, touches it, enters and is lost upon the black. The longings by which I had just now been absorbed, to go to Guermantes, to travel, to live a life of happiness—I was now so remote from them that their fulfilment would have afforded me no pleasure. How readily would I have sacrificed them all, just to be able to cry, all night long, in the arms of Mamma! Shuddering with emotion, I could not take my agonised eyes from my mother's face, which was not to appear that evening in the bedroom where I could see myself already lying, in imagination; and wished only that I were lying dead. And this state would persist until the morrow, when, the rays of morning leaning their bars of light, as the gardener might lean his ladder, against the wall overgrown with nasturtiums, which clambered up it as far as my window-sill, I would leap out of bed to run down at once into the garden, with no thought of the fact that evening must return, and with it the hour when I must leave my mother. And so it was from the 'Guermantes way' that I learned to distinguish between these states which reigned alternately in my mind, during certain periods, going so far as to divide every day between them, each one returning to dispossess the other with the regularity of a fever and ague: contiguous, and yet so foreign to one another, so devoid of means of communication, that I could no longer understand, or even picture to myself, in one state what I had desired or dreaded or even done in the other."

"Certes, elle avait la prétention d’aimer les « antiquités » et prenait un air ravi et fin pour dire qu’elle adorait passer toute une journée à « bibeloter », à chercher « du bric-à-brac », des choses « du temps ». Bien qu’elle s’entêtât dans une sorte de point d’honneur (et semblât pratiquer quelque précepte familial) en ne répondant jamais aux questions et en ne « rendant pas de comptes » sur l’emploi de ses journées, elle parla une fois à Swann d’une amie qui l’avait invitée et chez qui tout était « de l’époque ». Mais Swann ne put arriver à lui faire dire quelle était cette époque. Pourtant, après avoir réfléchi, elle répondit que c’était « moyenâgeux ». Elle entendait par là qu’il y avait des boiseries. Quelque temps après elle lui reparla de son amie et ajouta, sur le ton hésitant et de l’air entendu dont on cite quelqu’un avec qui on a dîné la veille et dont on n’avait jamais entendu le nom, mais que vos amphitryons avaient l’air de considérer comme quelqu’un de si célèbre qu’on espère que l’interlocuteur saura bien de qui vous voulez parler : « Elle a une salle à manger… du… dix-huitième ! »","Admittedly, she pretended to like ""antiques"" and put on a delighted and shrewd air to say that she adored spending a whole day ""trinkets"", looking for ""bric-a-brac"", things ""from the time "". Although she persisted in a kind of point of honor (and seemed to practice some family precept) by never answering questions and by not ""rendering accounts"" for the use of her days, she once spoke to Swann from a friend who had invited her and with whom everything was ""from the time"". But Swann could not get him to say what that period was. However, after thinking it over, she replied that it was “medieval”. By that she meant there was woodwork. Some time later she spoke to him again about her friend and added, in the hesitant tone and knowing air with which one quotes someone with whom one had dined the day before and whose name one had never heard, but that your hosts seemed to consider someone so famous that one hopes the interlocutor will know who you are talking about: ""She has a dining room… from the… eighteenth!"" »","Of course she claimed she loved “antiques” and assumed a rapturous and discriminating air when she said she adored spending a whole day “collecting curios,” looking for “bric-a-brac,” things “from the past.” Although she persisted in a sort of point of honor (and as though she were obeying some family precept) in never answering questions or “accounting” for how she spent her days, she talked to Swann once about a friend who had invited her to her house, where everything was “period.” But Swann could not manage to make her say what that period was. After some reflection, however, she answered that it was “medieval.” By this she meant that there was wood paneling. Sometime later, she talked to him about her friend again and added, in the hesitant tone and with the knowing look with which you mention someone you have had dinner with the night before and whose name you never heard before, but whom your hosts seemed to consider someone so celebrated that you hope the person you are talking to will know who you are talking about: “Her dining room . . . is . . . eighteenth century!”","It was true that she claimed to be fond of 'antiques,' and used to assume a rapturous and knowing air when she confessed how she loved to spend the whole day 'rummaging' in second-hand shops, hunting for 'bric-à-brac,' and things of the 'right date.' Although it was a point of honour, to which she obstinately clung, as though obeying some old family custom, that she should never answer any questions, never give any account of what she did during the daytime, she spoke to Swann once about a friend to whose house she had been invited, and had found that everything in it was 'of the period.' Swann could not get her to tell him what 'period' it was. Only after thinking the matter over she replied that it was 'mediaeval'; by which she meant that the walls were panelled. Some time later she spoke to him again of her friend, and added, in the hesitating but confident tone in which one refers to a person whom one has met somewhere, at dinner, the night before, of whom one had never heard until then, but whom one's hosts seemed to regard as some one so celebrated and important that one hopes that one's listener will know quite well who is meant, and will be duly impressed: ""Her dining-room... is... eighteenth century!"""

"Un jour, comme je m’ennuyais à notre place familière, à côté des chevaux de bois, Françoise m’avait emmené en excursion – au delà de la frontière que gardent à intervalles égaux les petits bastions des marchandes de sucre d’orge – dans ces régions voisines mais étrangères où les visages sont inconnus, où passe la voiture aux chèvres ; puis elle était revenue prendre ses affaires sur sa chaise adossée à un massif de lauriers ; en l’attendant je foulais la grande pelouse chétive et rase, jaunie par le soleil, au bout de laquelle le bassin est dominé par une statue quand, de l’allée, s’adressant à une fillette à cheveux roux qui jouait au volant devant la vasque, une autre, en train de mettre son manteau et de serrer sa raquette, lui cria, d’une voix brève : « Adieu, Gilberte, je rentre, n’oublie pas que nous venons ce soir chez toi après dîner. » Ce nom de Gilberte passa près de moi, évoquant d’autant plus l’existence de celle qu’il désignait qu’il ne la nommait pas seulement comme un absent dont on parle, mais l’interpellait ; il passa ainsi près de moi, en action pour ainsi dire, avec une puissance qu’accroissait la courbe de son jet et l’approche de son but ; – transportant à son bord, je le sentais, la connaissance, les notions qu’avait de celle à qui il était adressé, non pas moi, mais l’amie qui l’appelait, tout ce que, tandis qu’elle le prononçait, elle revoyait ou, du moins, possédait en sa mémoire, de leur intimité quotidienne, des visites qu’elles se faisaient l’une chez l’autre, de tout cet inconnu, encore plus inaccessible et plus douloureux pour moi d’être au contraire si familier et si maniable pour cette fille heureuse qui m’en frôlait, sans que j’y puisse pénétrer, et le jetait en plein air dans un cri ; – laissant déjà flotter dans l’air l’émanation délicieuse qu’il avait fait se dégager, en les touchant avec précision, de quelques points invisibles de la vie de Mlle Swann, du soir qui allait venir, tel qu’il serait, après dîner, chez elle ; – formant, passager céleste au milieu des enfants et des bonnes, un petit nuage d’une couleur précieuse, pareil à celui qui, bombé au-dessus d’un beau jardin du Poussin, reflète minutieusement comme un nuage d’opéra, plein de chevaux et de chars, quelque apparition de la vie des dieux ; – jetant enfin, sur cette herbe pelée, à l’endroit où elle était un morceau à la fois de pelouse flétrie et un moment de l’après-midi de la blonde joueuse de volant (qui ne s’arrêta de le lancer et de le rattraper que quand une institutrice à plumet bleu l’eût appelée), une petite bande merveilleuse et couleur d’héliotrope, impalpable comme un reflet et superposée comme un tapis, sur lequel je ne pus me lasser de promener mes pas attardés, nostalgiques et profanateurs, tandis que Françoise me criait : « Allons, aboutonnez voir votre paletot et filons », et que je remarquais pour la première fois avec irritation qu’elle avait un langage vulgaire, et hélas, pas de plumet bleu à son chapeau.","One day, as I was bored in our familiar place, next to the wooden horses, Françoise had taken me on an excursion - beyond the border guarded at equal intervals by the small bastions of the barley-sugar sellers - in these neighboring but foreign regions where the faces are unknown, where the goat cart passes; then she returned to take her things from her chair, leaning against a clump of laurels; while I was waiting for him, I was treading the large scrawny, shaven lawn, yellowed by the sun, at the end of which the pool is dominated by a statue when, from the driveway, speaking to a little girl with red hair who was playing another, in the process of putting on her coat and clutching her racket, cried to her in a curt voice: ""Adieu, Gilberte, I'm going home, don't forget that we're coming to your house this evening after dinner."" This name of Gilberte passed close to me, evoking the existence of the one it designated all the more because it not only named her as an absentee of whom we speak, but challenged her; it thus passed close to me, in action, so to speak, with a power which increased the curve of its jet and the approach of its goal; – carrying on board, I felt, the knowledge, the notions that had of the one to whom it was addressed, not me, but the friend who called him, all that, while she pronounced it, she saw again or, at least, possessed in her memory, of their daily intimacy, of the visits they made to each other, of all this unknown, even more inaccessible and more painful for me to be on the contrary so familiar and so manageable for this happy girl who brushed against me, without my being able to penetrate it, and threw it into the open air with a cry; – already letting float in the air the delicious emanation which he had caused to emerge, by touching them with precision, from a few invisible points in Mlle.

"Quelquefois j’étais tiré de ma lecture, dès le milieu de l’après-midi, par la fille du jardinier, qui courait comme une folle, renversant sur son passage un oranger, se coupant un doigt, se cassant une dent et criant : « Les voilà, les voilà ! » pour que Françoise et moi nous accourions et ne manquions rien du spectacle. C’était les jours où, pour des manœuvres de garnison, la troupe traversait Combray, prenant généralement la rue Sainte-Hildegarde. Tandis que nos domestiques assis en rang sur des chaises en dehors de la grille regardaient les promeneurs dominicaux de Combray et se faisaient voir d’eux, la fille du jardinier, par la fente que laissaient entre elles deux maisons lointaines de l’avenue de la Gare, avait aperçu l’éclat des casques. Les domestiques avaient rentré précipitamment leurs chaises, car quand les cuirassiers défilaient rue Sainte-Hildegarde, ils en remplissaient toute la largeur, et le galop des chevaux rasait les maisons, couvrant les trottoirs submergés comme des berges qui offrent un lit trop étroit à un torrent déchaîné.","Sometimes I was pulled from my reading, in the middle of the afternoon, by the gardener's daughter, who ran like a madwoman, knocking over an orange tree in her path, cutting her finger, breaking a tooth and shouting: “There they are, there they are! so that Françoise and I would come running and miss nothing of the show. These were the days when, for garrison manoeuvres, the troops crossed Combray, generally taking the rue Sainte-Hildegarde. While our servants, seated in a row on chairs outside the gate, watched the Sunday strollers of Combray and made themselves visible to them, the gardener's daughter, through the gap left between them by two distant houses on the Avenue de la Station, had seen the shine of the helmets. The servants had hastily tucked in their chairs, for when the cuirassiers marched past rue Sainte-Hildegarde, they filled the entire width of it, and the galloping horses skimmed the houses, covering the submerged sidewalks like banks that offer too narrow a bed to a torrent. unleashed.","Sometimes I would be drawn from my reading, in the middle of the afternoon, by the gardener’s daughter, who would run like a lunatic, overturning an orange tree in its tub as she went by, cutting a finger, breaking a tooth, and shouting, “They’re coming, they’re coming!” so that Françoise and I should run out too and not miss any of the show. This was on the days when the regiment passed through Combray on its way to garrison maneuvers, generally going down the rue Sainte-Hildegarde. While our servants, sitting in a row on chairs outside the railings, gazed at the people of Combray taking their Sunday walk and allowed themselves to be gazed at in return, the gardener’s daughter through a slit left between two distant houses in the avenue de la Gare had caught sight of the glitter of helmets. The servants had rushed to bring in their chairs, for when the cuirassiers paraded down the rue Sainte-Hildegarde, they filled its entire breadth, and the cantering horses grazed the houses, covering pavements submerged like banks that offer too narrow a bed for a torrent unleashed.","Sometimes I would be torn from my book, in the middle of the afternoon, by the gardener's daughter, who came running like a mad thing, overturning an orange-tree in its tub, cutting a finger, breaking a tooth, and screaming out ""They're coming, they're coming!"" so that Françoise and I should run too and not miss anything of the show. That was on days when the cavalry stationed in Combray went out for some military exercise, going as a rule by the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde. While our servants, sitting in a row on their chairs outside the garden railings, stared at the people of Combray taking their Sunday walks and were stared at in return, the gardener's daughter, through the gap which there was between two houses far away in the Avenue de la Gare, would have spied the glitter of helmets. The servants then hurried in with their chairs, for when the troopers filed through the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde they filled it from side to side, and their jostling horses scraped against the walls of the houses, covering and drowning the pavements like banks which present too narrow a channel to a river in flood. ""Poor children,"" Françoise would exclaim, in tears almost before she had reached the railings; ""poor boys, to be mown down like grass in a meadow."
"Et enfin il avait mécontenté tout le monde parce que, étant venu déjeuner une heure et demie en retard et couvert de boue, au lieu de s’excuser, il avait dit : – Je ne me laisse jamais influencer par les perturbations de l’atmosphère ni par les divisions conventionnelles du temps.

There’s Françoise, watching for us. Your aunt must be worried; that means we’re late.”","Good heavens! There is Françoise looking out for us; your aunt must be anxious; that means we are late."""
"Il la regardait ; un fragment de la fresque apparaissait dans son visage et dans son corps, que dès lors il chercha toujours à y retrouver, soit qu’il fût auprès d’Odette, soit qu’il pensât seulement à elle, et bien qu’il ne tînt sans doute au chef-d’œuvre florentin que parce qu’il le retrouvait en elle, pourtant cette ressemblance lui conférait à elle aussi une beauté, la rendait plus précieuse. Swann se reprocha d’avoir méconnu le prix d’un être qui eût paru adorable au grand Sandro, et il se félicita que le plaisir qu’il avait à voir Odette trouvât une justification dans sa propre culture esthétique. Il se dit qu’en associant la pensée d’Odette à ses rêves de bonheur, il ne s’était pas résigné à un pis-aller aussi imparfait qu’il l’avait cru jusqu’ici, puisqu’elle contentait en lui ses goûts d’art les plus raffinés. Il oubliait qu’Odette n’était pas plus pour cela une femme selon son désir, puisque précisément son désir avait toujours été orienté dans un sens opposé à ses goûts esthétiques. Le mot d’« œuvre florentine » rendit un grand service à Swann. Il lui permit, comme un titre, de faire pénétrer l’image d’Odette dans un monde de rêves où elle n’avait pas eu accès jusqu’ici et où elle s’imprégna de noblesse. Et tandis que la vue purement charnelle qu’il avait eue de cette femme, en renouvelant perpétuellement ses doutes sur la qualité de son visage, de son corps, de toute sa beauté, affaiblissait son amour, ces doutes furent détruits, cet amour assuré quand il eut à la place pour base les données d’une esthétique certaine ; sans compter que le baiser et la possession qui semblaient naturels et médiocres s’ils lui étaient accordés par une chair abîmée, venant couronner l’adoration d’une pièce de musée, lui parurent devoir être surnaturels et délicieux.","He looked at her; a fragment of the fresco appeared in her face and in her body, which from then on he always sought to find there, whether he was near Odette, or whether he was thinking only of her, and although he could not keep no doubt to the Florentine masterpiece only because he found it in her, yet this resemblance conferred a beauty on her too, made her more precious. Swann reproached himself for having misunderstood the value of a being who would have seemed adorable to the great Sandro, and he congratulated himself that the pleasure he had in seeing Odette found a justification in his own aesthetic culture. He said to himself that by associating the thought of Odette with his dreams of happiness, he had not resigned himself to a makeshift as imperfect as he had believed until now, since she was satisfying his finest artistic tastes. He forgot that Odette was no more for that reason a woman according to his desire, since precisely his desire had always been oriented in a direction opposed to his aesthetic tastes. The term ""Florentine work"" did Swann a great service. It allowed her, like a title, to bring the image of Odette into a world of dreams to which she had not had access until now and where she became imbued with nobility. And while the purely carnal sight he had had of this woman, perpetually renewing his doubts about the quality of her face, of her body, of all her beauty, weakened his love, these doubts were destroyed, this love assured when instead, it had as its basis the data of a certain aesthetic; not to mention that the kiss and the possession which seemed natural and mediocre if granted to him by damaged flesh, coming to crown the adoration of a museum piece, seemed to him to be supernatural and delicious.","He looked at her; a fragment of the fresco appeared in her face and in her body, and from then on he would always try to find it in her again, whether he was with Odette or was only thinking of her, and even though he probably valued the Florentine masterpiece only because he found it again in her, nevertheless that resemblance conferred a certain beauty on her too, made her more precious. Swann reproached himself for having misunderstood the value of a creature who would have appeared captivating to the great Sandro, and he felt happy that his pleasure in seeing Odette could be justified by his own aesthetic culture. He told himself that, in associating the thought of Odette with his dreams of happiness, he had not been resigning himself to a second best as imperfect as he had believed until now, since she satisfied his most refined artistic tastes. He forgot that this did not make Odette any more the sort of woman he desired, since in fact his desire had always been oriented in a direction opposite to his aesthetic tastes. The words “Florentine painting” did Swann a great service. They allowed him, like a title, to bring the image of Odette into a world of dreams to which it had not had access until now and where it was steeped in nobility. And, while the simple view he had had of this woman in the flesh, by perpetually renewing his doubts about the quality of her face, her body, her whole beauty, had weakened his love, these doubts were vanquished, that love confirmed when he had instead, for a foundation, the principles of an unquestionable aesthetic; while the kiss and the possession that would seem natural and ordinary if they had been granted him by damaged flesh, coming as they did to crown the adoration of a museum piece appeared to him necessarily supernatural and delicious.","He stood gazing at her; traces of the old fresco were apparent in her face and limbs, and these he tried incessantly, afterwards, to recapture, both when he was with Odette, and when he was only thinking of her in her absence; and, albeit his admiration for the Florentine masterpiece was probably based upon his discovery that it had been reproduced in her, the similarity enhanced her beauty also, and rendered her more precious in his sight. Swann reproached himself with his failure, hitherto, to estimate at her true worth a creature whom the great Sandro would have adored, and counted himself fortunate that his pleasure in the contemplation of Odette found a justification in his own system of aesthetic. He told himself that, in choosing the thought of Odette as the inspiration of his dreams of ideal happiness, he was not, as he had until then supposed, falling back, merely, upon an expedient of doubtful and certainly inadequate value, since she contained in herself what satisfied the utmost refinement of his taste in art. He failed to observe that this quality would not naturally avail to bring Odette into the category of women whom he found desirable, simply because his desires had always run counter to his aesthetic taste. The words 'Florentine painting' were invaluable to Swann. They enabled him (gave him, as it were, a legal title) to introduce the image of Odette into a world of dreams and fancies which, until then, she had been debarred from entering, and where she assumed a new and nobler form. And whereas the mere sight of her in the flesh, by perpetually reviving his misgivings as to the quality of her face, her figure, the whole of her beauty, used to cool the ardour of his love, those misgivings were swept away and that love confirmed now that he could re-erect his estimate of her on the sure foundations of his aesthetic principles; while the kiss, the bodily surrender which would have seemed natural and but moderately attractive, had they been granted him by a creature of somewhat withered flesh and sluggish blood, coming, as now they came, to crown his adoration of a masterpiece in a gallery, must, it seemed, prove as exquisite as they would be supernatural."
"Ils m’ont été signalés à la décharge de ces deux malandrins par un article de mon très cher maître, le père Lecomte, agréable aux Dieux immortels. À propos voici un livre que je n’ai pas le temps de lire en ce moment qui est recommandé, paraît-il, par cet immense bonhomme. Il tient, m’a-t-on dit, l’auteur, le sieur Bergotte, pour un coco des plus subtils ; et bien qu’il fasse preuve, des fois, de mansuétudes assez mal explicables, sa parole est pour moi oracle delphique. Lis donc ces proses lyriques, et si le gigantesque assembleur de rythmes qui a écrit Bhagavat et le Levrier de Magnus a dit vrai, par Apollon tu goûteras, cher maître, les joies nectaréennes de l’Olympos. » C’est sur un ton sarcastique qu’il m’avait demandé de l’appeler « cher maître » et qu’il m’appelait lui-même ainsi. Mais en réalité nous prenions un certain plaisir à ce jeu, étant encore rapprochés de l’âge où on croit qu’on crée ce qu’on nomme.","They were pointed out to me in defense of these two villains by an article by my very dear master, Father Lecomte, pleasing to the immortal Gods. By the way here is a book that I don't have time to read at the moment which is recommended, it seems, by this huge fellow. He holds, I have been told, the author, the Sieur Bergotte, for one of the most subtle coconuts; and although he shows, at times, inexplicable leniency, his word is for me a Delphic oracle. Read then these lyrical proses, and if the gigantic assembler of rhythms who wrote Bhagavat and the Greyhound of Magnus was right, by Apollo you will taste, dear master, the nectarean joys of Olympos. It was in a sarcastic tone that he had asked me to call him ""dear master"" and that he himself called me that. But in reality we took a certain pleasure in this game, being still close to the age when one believes that one creates what one names.","They were pointed out to me in defense of those two rogues in an article by my very dear master, old Leconte, acceptable to the Immortal Gods. Speaking of which, here’s a book I don’t have time to read right now which is recommended, it seems, by that colossal fellow. I’ve been told he considers the author, the Honorable Bergotte, to be a most subtle individual; and even though he may evince, at times, a goodness of heart rather hard to explain, for me his word is a Delphic Oracle. Do read these lyrical pieces of prose, therefore, and if the titanic rhymester who composed ‘Bhagavat’ and ‘Le Lévrier de Magnus’15 has spoken the truth, by Apollo, you will taste, dear master, the nectarine joys of Olympos.” It was in a sarcastic tone that he had asked me to call him “dear master” and that he called me the same. But in reality we took a certain pleasure in this game, since we were still close to the age when one believes one creates what one names.","They were submitted to my judgment, as evidence for the defence of the two runagates, in an article by my very dear master Father Lecomte, who is found pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods. By which token, here is a book which I have not the time, just now, to read, a book recommended, it would seem, by that colossal fellow. He regards, or so they tell me, its author, one Bergotte, Esquire, as a subtle scribe, more subtle, indeed, than any beast of the field; and, albeit he exhibits on occasion a critical pacifism, a tenderness in suffering fools, for which it is impossible to account, and hard to make allowance, still his word has weight with me as it were the Delphic Oracle. Read you then this lyrical prose, and, if the Titanic master-builder of rhythm who composed Bhagavat and the Lévrier de Magnus speaks not falsely, then, by Apollo, you may taste, even you, my master, the ambrosial joys of Olympus. "" It was in an ostensible vein of sarcasm that he had asked me to call him, and that he himself called me, ""my master."" But, as a matter of fact, we each derived a certain amount of satisfaction from the mannerism, being still at the age in which one believes that one gives a thing real existence by giving it a name."
"Aussi après avoir trouvé la maison bien située, ils parlaient d’une autre qui l’était mieux, mais qui n’avait rien à voir avec Gilberte, ou de financiers d’un cran supérieur à son grand-père ; et s’ils avaient eu l’air un moment d’être du même avis que moi, c’était par un malentendu qui ne tardait pas à se dissiper. C’est que, pour percevoir dans tout ce qui entourait Gilberte, une qualité inconnue analogue dans le monde des émotions à ce que peut être dans celui des couleurs l’infra-rouge, mes parents étaient dépourvus de ce sens supplémentaire et momentané dont m’avait doté l’amour.","So after having found the house well situated, they spoke of another which was better, but which had nothing to do with Gilberte, or of financiers of a rank superior to her grandfather; and if they had seemed for a moment to be of the same opinion as me, it was through a misunderstanding which was not long in dissipating. It is because, in order to perceive in everything that surrounded Gilberte, an unknown quality analogous in the world of emotions to what infra-red can be in that of colors, my parents were devoid of this additional and momentary sense of which I had endowed love.","And so, after having agreed that the house was well situated, they would talk about another that was better situated, but that had nothing to do with Gilberte, or about financiers a cut above her grandfather; and if they had seemed for a moment to be of the same opinion as me, it was because of a misunderstanding that would soon be dispelled. For, in order to perceive in everything that surrounded Gilberte an indefinable quality analogous in the world of emotions to what infrared may be in the world of colors, my parents would have needed that supplementary and ephemeral sense with which I had been endowed by love.","And so, after admitting that the house was in a good position, they would go on to speak of some other house that was in a better, but had nothing to do with Gilberte, or of financiers on a larger scale than her grandfather had been; and if they had appeared, for a moment, to be of my opinion, that was a mistake which was very soon corrected. For in order to distinguish in all Gilberte's surroundings an indefinable quality analogous, in the scale of emotions, to what in the scale of colours is called infra-red, a supplementary sense of perception was required, with which love, for the time being, had endowed me; and this my parents lacked."
"Je ne savais pas la raison du plaisir que j’avais eu à les apercevoir à l’horizon et l’obligation de chercher à découvrir cette raison me semblait bien pénible ; j’avais envie de garder en réserve dans ma tête ces lignes remuantes au soleil et de n’y plus penser maintenant. Et il est probable que si je l’avais fait, les deux clochers seraient allés à jamais rejoindre tant d’arbres, de toits, de parfums, de sons, que j’avais distingués des autres à cause de ce plaisir obscur qu’ils m’avaient procuré et que je n’ai jamais approfondi. Je descendis causer avec mes parents en attendant le docteur. Puis nous repartîmes, je repris ma place sur le siège, je tournai la tête pour voir encore les clochers qu’un peu plus tard j’aperçus une dernière fois au tournant d’un chemin.","I did not know the reason for the pleasure I had had in seeing them on the horizon and the obligation to seek to discover this reason seemed to me very painful; I wanted to keep those stirring lines in the sun in my head and forget about them now. And it is probable that if I had done so, the two steeples would have gone forever to join so many trees, roofs, perfumes, sounds, which I had distinguished from the others because of this dark pleasure that they had given me and that I never went into. I went downstairs to chat with my parents while waiting for the doctor. Then we left, I resumed my place on the seat, I turned my head to still see the steeples which a little later I saw for the last time at the bend in a path.","I did not know why I had taken such pleasure in the sight of them on the horizon and the obligation to try to discover the reason seemed to me quite painful; I wanted to hold in reserve in my head those lines moving in the sun, and not think about them anymore now. And it is quite likely that had I done so, the two steeples would have gone forever to join the many trees, rooftops, fragrances, sounds, that I had distinguished from others because of the obscure pleasure they gave me which I never thoroughly studied. I got down to talk to my parents while we waited for the doctor. Then we set off again, I was back in my place on the seat, I turned my head to see the steeples again, a little later glimpsing them one last time at a bend in the road.","I did not know the reason for the pleasure which I had found in seeing them upon the horizon, and the business of trying to find out what that reason was seemed to me irksome; I wished only to keep in reserve in my brain those converging lines, moving in the sunshine, and, for the time being, to think of them no more. And it is probable that, had I done so, those two steeples would have vanished for ever, in a great medley of trees and roofs and scents and sounds which I had noticed and set apart on account of the obscure sense of pleasure which they gave me, but without ever exploring them more fully. I got down from the box to talk to my parents while we were waiting for the Doctor to reappear. Then it was time to start; I climbed up again to my place, turning my head to look back, once more, at my steeples, of which, a little later, I caught a farewell glimpse at a turn in the road."
"– Comme il est gentil ! il est déjà galant, il a un petit œil pour les femmes : il tient de son oncle. Ce sera un parfait gentleman, ajouta-t-elle en serrant les dents pour donner à la phrase un accent légèrement britannique.

"Je m’amusais à regarder les carafes que les gamins mettaient dans la Vivonne pour prendre les petits poissons, et qui, remplies par la rivière, où elles sont à leur tour encloses, à la fois « contenant » aux flancs transparents comme une eau durcie, et « contenu » plongé dans un plus grand contenant de cristal liquide et courant, évoquaient l’image de la fraîcheur d’une façon plus délicieuse et plus irritante qu’elles n’eussent fait sur une table servie, en ne la montrant qu’en fuite dans cette allitération perpétuelle entre l’eau sans consistance où les mains ne pouvaient la capter et le verre sans fluidité où le palais ne pourrait en jouir. Je me promettais de venir là plus tard avec des lignes ; j’obtenais qu’on tirât un peu de pain des provisions du goûter ; j’en jetais dans la Vivonne des boulettes qui semblaient suffire pour y provoquer un phénomène de sursaturation, car l’eau se solidifiait aussitôt autour d’elles en grappes ovoïdes de têtards inanitiés qu’elle tenait sans doute jusque-là en dissolution, invisibles, tout près d’être en voie de cristallisation.","I had fun looking at the carafes that the kids put in the Vivonne to catch the little fish, and which, filled by the river, where they are in turn enclosed, both ""container"" with transparent sides like hardened water , and ""contents"" immersed in a larger container of liquid and current crystal, evoked the image of freshness in a more delicious and more irritating way than they would have done on a served table, by showing it only on the run in this perpetual alliteration between the water without consistency where the hands could not capture it and the glass without fluidity where the palate could not enjoy it. I promised myself to come there later with lines; I managed to get a little bread from the snack provisions; I threw balls of it into the Vivonne which seemed to be enough to cause a phenomenon of supersaturation there, because the water immediately solidified around them in ovoid clusters of inanitiated tadpoles which it had probably held until then in dissolution, invisible , very close to being in the process of crystallization.","I liked to look at the carafes which the boys put in the Vivonne to catch little fish, and which were filled by the river that in turn enclosed them, so that they became at once a “container” with transparent sides like hardened water and a “content” immersed in a larger container of coursing liquid crystal, and evoked the image of coolness more deliciously and vexingly than they would have done on a table laid for dinner, by showing it only in that perpetual alliterative flight between the water without consistency in which my hands could not capture it and the glass without fluidity in which my palate could not enjoy it. I promised myself I would return there later with some fishing lines; I persuaded them to take out a bit of bread from the provisions for our snack; I threw it into the Vivonne in pellets that seemed sufficient to provoke a phenomenon of supersaturation, for the water immediately solidified around them in ovoid clusters of starving tadpoles which until then it had no doubt been holding in solution, invisible, on the point of beginning to crystallize.","I would amuse myself by watching the glass jars which the boys used to lower into the Vivonne, to catch minnows, and which, filled by the current of the stream, in which they themselves also were enclosed, at once 'containers' whose transparent sides were like solidified water and 'contents' plunged into a still larger container of liquid, flowing crystal, suggested an image of coolness more delicious and more provoking than the same water in the same jars would have done, standing upon a table laid for dinner, by shewing it as perpetually in flight between the impalpable water, in which my hands could not arrest it, and the insoluble glass, in which my palate could not enjoy it. I decided that I would come there again with a line and catch fish; I begged for and obtained a morsel of bread from our luncheon basket; and threw into the Vivonne pellets which had the power, it seemed, to bring about a chemical precipitation, for the water at once grew solid round about them in oval clusters of emaciated tadpoles, which until then it had, no doubt, been holding in solution, invisible, but ready and alert to enter the stage of crystallisation."
"ne pût pas se renouveler. Pour cela il lui fallait veiller sur Odette. On dit souvent qu’en dénonçant à un ami les fautes de sa maîtresse, on ne réussit qu’à le rapprocher d’elle parce qu’il ne leur ajoute pas foi, mais combien davantage s’il leur ajoute foi ! « Mais, se disait Swann, comment réussir à la protéger ? Il pouvait peut-être la préserver d’une certaine femme, mais il y en avait des centaines d’autres, et il comprit quelle folie avait passé sur lui quand il avait, le soir où il n’avait pas trouvé Odette chez les Verdurin, commencé de désirer la possession, toujours impossible, d’un autre être. Heureusement pour Swann, sous les souffrances nouvelles qui venaient d’entrer dans son âme comme des hordes d’envahisseurs, il existait un fond de nature plus ancien, plus doux et silencieusement laborieux, comme les cellules d’un organe blessé qui se mettent aussitôt en mesure de refaire les tissus lésés, comme les muscles d’un membre paralysé qui tendent à reprendre leurs mouvements. Ces plus anciens, plus autochtones habitants de son âme, employèrent un instant toutes les forces de Swann à ce travail obscurément réparateur qui donne l’illusion du repos à un convalescent, à un opéré. Cette fois-ci ce fut moins comme d’habitude dans le cerveau de Swann que se produisit cette détente par épuisement, ce fut plutôt dans son cœur. Mais toutes les choses de la vie qui ont existé une fois tendent à se récréer, et comme un animal expirant qu’agite de nouveau le sursaut d’une convulsion qui semblait finie, sur le cœur, un instant épargné, de Swann, d’elle-même la même souffrance vint retracer la même croix. Il se rappela ces soirs de clair de lune, où allongé dans sa victoria qui le menait rue La Pérouse, il cultivait voluptueusement en lui les émotions de l’homme amoureux, sans savoir le fruit empoisonné qu’elles produiraient nécessairement. Mais toutes ces pensées ne durèrent que l’espace d’une seconde, le temps qu’il portât la main à son cœur, reprit sa respiration et parvînt à sourire pour dissimuler sa torture. Déjà il recommençait à poser ses questions. Car sa jalousie qui avait pris une peine qu’un ennemi ne se serait pas donnée pour arriver à lui faire asséner ce coup, à lui faire faire la connaissance de la douleur la plus cruelle qu’il eût encore jamais connue, sa jalousie ne trouvait pas qu’il eut assez souffert et cherchait à lui faire recevoir une blessure plus profonde encore. Telle, comme une divinité méchante, sa jalousie inspirait Swann et le poussait à sa perte. Ce ne fut pas sa faute, mais celle d’Odette seulement si d’abord son supplice ne s’aggrava pas.","could not be renewed. For that he had to watch over Odette. It is often said that by denouncing to a friend the faults of his mistress, one only succeeds in bringing him closer to her because he does not believe them, but how much more if he does believe them! ""But,"" Swann said to himself, ""how can we succeed in protecting her?"" He could perhaps save her from a certain woman, but there were hundreds of others, and he understood what madness had passed over him when he had, the evening when he had not found Odette at the Verdurins'. , began to desire the possession, always impossible, of another being. Fortunately for Swann, under the new sufferings which had just entered his soul like hordes of invaders, there existed an older, softer and silently laboring background of nature, like the cells of a wounded organ which immediately able to rebuild damaged tissues, such as the muscles of a paralyzed limb which tend to resume their movements. These oldest, most native inhabitants of his soul, for a moment employed all of Swann's strength in this obscurely restorative work which gives the illusion of rest to a convalescent, to an operator. This time it was less as usual in Swann's brain that this relaxation by exhaustion occurred, it was rather in his heart. But all the things in life that once existed tend to recreate themselves, and like an expiring animal stirred again by the start of a convulsion that seemed to be over, on the heart, for a moment spared, of Swann, of itself the same suffering came to retrace the same cross. He remembered those moonlit evenings when, lying in his victoria which led him to the Rue La Pérouse, he voluptuously cultivated within himself the emotions of a man in love, without knowing the poisonous fruit they would necessarily produce. But all these thoughts only lasted for a second, the time he put his hand to his heart, caught his breath and managed to smile to hide his torture. He was already beginning to ask his questions again. For his jealousy, which had taken pains that an enemy would not have taken in order to get him to deal this blow, to introduce him to the cruellest pain he had ever known, his jealousy found no not that he had suffered enough and was trying to cause her to receive an even deeper wound. Such, like a wicked divinity, his jealousy inspired Swann and drove him to his ruin. It was not his fault, but Odette's only if her ordeal did not increase in the first place.","He wanted the frightful thing she had told him she had done “two or three times” not to be repeated. For this, he had to watch over Odette. People often say that when we inform a friend of his mistress’s wrongdoings, we succeed only in attaching him to her more closely because he places no faith in them, but how much more so if he does place faith in them! But, said Swann to himself, how could he manage to protect her? He could perhaps keep her safe from a particular woman, but there were hundreds of others, and he realized what madness had come over him when he had begun, on the evening when he had not found Odette at the Verdurins’, to want something that was always impossible—to possess another person. Happily for Swann, beneath the new sufferings that had just entered his soul like hordes of invaders, there lay a natural substratum, older, gentler, and silently industrious, like the cells of an injured organ that immediately set about preparing to restore the damaged tissues, like the muscles of a paralyzed limb that try to resume their former movements. These older, more autochthonous inhabitants of his soul employed, for a moment, all of Swann’s strength in this dim recuperative work that gives the illusion of repose to a convalescent, to a surgical patient. This time it was not so much, as it usually was, in Swann’s brain that this relaxation induced by exhaustion took effect, it was rather in his heart. But all the things in life that have once existed tend to recur, and like a dying animal shaken one last time by the throes of a convulsion which seemed to have ended, upon Swann’s heart, spared for a moment, the same suffering returned of its own volition to carve the same cross again. He remembered those moonlit evenings when, lying back in the victoria that was taking him to the rue La Pérouse, he would voluptuously cultivate within himself the emotions of a man in love, without knowing the poisoned fruit they would necessarily bear. But all these thoughts did not last more than the space of a second, the time he took to bring his hand to his heart, catch his breath, and manage a smile to hide his agony. Already he was beginning to ask his questions again. For his jealousy, which had taken pains an enemy would not have taken to strike this blow, to introduce him to the most intense suffering he had yet known, did not believe he had suffered enough and sought to expose him to a wound that was deeper still. Thus, like a wicked deity, his jealousy inspired Swann and pushed him to his ruin. It was not his fault but only Odette’s if at first his torment did not grow worse.","He wished that the horrible thing which, she had told him, she had done ""two or three times"" might be prevented from occurring again. To ensure that, he must watch over Odette. People often say that, by pointing out to a man the faults of his mistress, you succeed only in strengthening his attachment to her, because he does not believe you; yet how much more so if he does! But, Swann asked himself, how could he manage to protect her? He might perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of any one woman, but there were hundreds of other women; and he realised how insane had been his ambition when he had begun (on the evening when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins') to desire the possession—as if that were ever possible—of another person. Happily for Swann, beneath the mass of suffering which had invaded his soul like a conquering horde of barbarians, there lay a natural foundation, older, more placid, and silently laborious, like the cells of an injured organ which at once set to work to repair the damaged tissues, or the muscles of a paralysed limb which tend to recover their former movements. These older, these autochthonous in-dwellers in his soul absorbed all Swann's strength, for a while, in that obscure task of reparation which gives one an illusory sense of repose during convalescence, or after an operation. This time it was not so much—as it ordinarily was—in Swann's brain that the slackening of tension due to exhaustion took effect, it was rather in his heart. But all the things in life that have once existed tend to recur, and, like a dying animal that is once more stirred by the throes of a convulsion which was, apparently, ended, upon Swann's heart, spared for a moment only, the same agony returned of its own accord to trace the same cross again. He remembered those moonlit evenings, when, leaning back in the victoria that was taking him to the Rue La Pérouse, he would cultivate with voluptuous enjoyment the emotions of a man in love, ignorant of the poisoned fruit that such emotions must inevitably bear. But all those thoughts lasted for no more than a second, the time that it took him to raise his hand to his heart, to draw breath again and to contrive to smile, so as to dissemble his torment. Already he had begun to put further questions. For his jealousy, which had taken an amount of trouble, such as no enemy would have incurred, to strike him this mortal blow, to make him forcibly acquainted with the most cruel pain that he had ever known, his jealousy was not satisfied that he had yet suffered enough, and sought to expose his bosom to an even deeper wound. Like an evil deity, his jealousy was inspiring Swann, was thrusting him on towards destruction. It was not his fault, but Odette's alone, if at first his punishment was not more severe."

But she told us about it at her next ‘at-home’; apparently it was quite horrible , she made us laugh till we cried.

"Et – ô merveilleuse indépendance des regards humains, retenus au visage par une corde si lâche, si longue, si extensible qu’ils peuvent se promener seuls loin de lui – pendant que Mme de Guermantes était assise dans la chapelle au-dessus des tombes de ses morts, ses regards flânaient çà et là, montaient le long des piliers, s’arrêtaient même sur moi comme un rayon de soleil errant dans la nef, mais un rayon de soleil qui, au moment où je reçus sa caresse, me sembla conscient. Quant à Mme de Guermantes elle-même, comme elle restait immobile, assise comme une mère qui semble ne pas voir les audaces espiègles et les entreprises indiscrètes de ses enfants qui jouent et interpellent des personnes qu’elle ne connaît pas, il me fut impossible de savoir si elle approuvait ou blâmait, dans le désœuvrement de son âme, le vagabondage de ses regards.","And – oh marvelous independence of human gazes, held in the face by a cord so loose, so long, so extensible that they can walk alone far from him – while Madame de Guermantes was seated in the chapel above the tombs of his dead, his gaze wandered hither and thither, climbed along the pillars, even rested on me like a ray of sunlight wandering in the nave, but a ray of sunlight which, the moment I received his caress, seemed to me conscious . As for Madame de Guermantes herself, as she remained motionless, seated like a mother who seems not to see the mischievous boldness and the indiscreet enterprises of her children who are playing and calling out to people she does not know, it was impossible for me to know whether she approved or blamed, in the idleness of her soul, the wandering of her eyes.","And—oh, the marvelous independence of the human gaze, tied to the face by a cord so lax, so long, so extensible that it can travel out alone far away from it—while Mme. de Guermantes sat in the chapel above the tombs of her dead, her gaze strolled here and there, climbed up the pillars, paused even on me like a ray of sunlight wandering through the nave, but a ray of sunlight which, at the moment I received its caress, seemed to me conscious. As for Mme. de Guermantes herself, since she remained motionless, sitting there like a mother who does not appear to see the bold pranks and indiscreet enterprises of her children, who play and call out to people she does not know , it was impossible for me to tell if she approved or disapproved, in the idleness of her soul, of the vagabondage of her gaze.","And then—oh, marvellous independence of the human gaze, tied to the human face by a cord so loose, so long, so elastic that it can stray, alone, as far as it may choose—while Mme. de Guermantes sat in the chapel above the tombs of her dead ancestors, her gaze lingered here and wandered there, rose to the capitals of the pillars, and even rested upon myself, like a ray of sunlight straying down the nave, but a ray of sunlight which, at the moment when I received its caress, appeared conscious of where it fell. As for Mme. de Guermantes herself, since she remained there motionless, sitting like a mother who affects not to notice the rude or awkward conduct of her children who, in the course of their play, are speaking to people whom she does not know, it was impossible for me to determine whether she approved or condemned the vagrancy of her eyes in the careless detachment of her heart."
"L’idée de perfection que je portais en moi, je l’avais prêtée alors à la hauteur d’une victoria, à la maigreur de ces chevaux furieux et légers comme des guêpes, les yeux injectés de sang comme les cruels chevaux de Diomède, et que maintenant, pris d’un désir de revoir ce que j’avais aimé, aussi ardent que celui qui me poussait bien des années auparavant dans ces mêmes chemins, je voulais avoir de nouveau sous les yeux, au moment où l’énorme cocher de Mme Swann, surveillé par un petit groom gros comme le poing et aussi enfantin que saint Georges, essayait de maîtriser leurs ailes d’acier qui se débattaient effarouchées et palpitantes.","The idea of perfection that I carried in me, I had lent it then to the height of a victoria, to the thinness of these furious horses and light as wasps, their eyes bloodshot like the cruel horses of Diomede, and that now, seized with a desire to see again what I had loved, as ardent as that which pushed me many years before along these same paths, I wanted to have before my eyes again, at the moment when the enormous coachman of Madame Swann, watched by a little groom the size of a fist and as childish as Saint George, tried to control their steel wings which fluttered startled and throbbing.","The idea of perfection which I carried inside me I had conferred at that time upon the height of a victoria, upon the slenderness of those horses, as furious and light as wasps, their eyes bloodshot like the cruel steeds of Diomedes,37 which now, filled as I was with a desire to see again what I had once loved, as ardent as the desire that had driven me down these same paths many years before, I wanted to see before my eyes again at the moment when Mme. Swann’s enormous coachman, watched over by a little groom as fat as a fist and as childlike as Saint George, tried to control those wings of steel as they thrashed about quivering with fear.","The idea of perfection which I had within me I had bestowed, in that other time, upon the height of a victoria, upon the raking thinness of those horses, frenzied and light as wasps upon the wing, with bloodshot eyes like the cruel steeds of Diomed, which now, smitten by a desire to sea again what I had once loved, as ardent as the desire that had driven me, many years before, along the same paths, I wished to see renewed before my eyes at the moment when Mme. Swann's enormous coachman, supervised by a groom no bigger than his fist, and as infantile as Saint George in the picture, endeavoured to curb the ardour of the flying, steel-tipped pinions with which they thundered along the ground."
"Si alors Françoise, remplie comme un poète d’un flot de pensées confuses sur le chagrin, sur les souvenirs de famille, s’excusait de ne pas savoir répondre à mes théories et disait : « Je ne sais pas m’esprimer », je triomphais de cet aveu avec un bon sens ironique et brutal digne du docteur Percepied ; et si elle ajoutait : « Elle était tout de même de la parentèse, il reste toujours le respect qu’on doit à la parentèse », je haussais les épaules et je me disais : « Je suis bien bon de discuter avec une illettrée qui fait des cuirs pareils », adoptant ainsi pour juger Françoise le point de vue mesquin d’hommes dont ceux qui les méprisent le plus dans l’impartialité de la méditation, sont fort capables de tenir le rôle, quand ils jouent une des scènes vulgaires de la vie.","If then Françoise, filled like a poet with a flood of confused thoughts about grief, about family memories, apologized for not knowing how to respond to my theories and said: ""I don't know how to express myself,"" I triumphed over this confession with an ironic and brutal good sense worthy of Doctor Percepied; and if she added: ""She was all the same from parentesis, there is always the respect one owes to parentesis"", I would shrug my shoulders and say to myself: ""I'm very good to discuss with an illiterate person who such leathers"", thus adopting to judge Françoise the petty point of view of men of whom those who despise them the most in the impartiality of meditation, are very capable of playing the role, when they play one of the vulgar scenes of the life.","If Françoise then, filled like a poet with a flood of confused thoughts about bereavement, about family memories, excused herself for not knowing how to answer my theories and said: “I don’t know how to espress myself,” I would gloat over that admission with a harsh and ironic common sense worthy of Dr. Percepied; and if she added: “All the same, she was your own kith and kindred,48 and there’s a proper respect we owe to our kith and kindred , you know,’ I would shrug my shoulders and say to myself: “Look at me, arguing with an illiterate woman who makes such blunders,” adopting, in judging Françoise, the mean-spirited attitude of men whose behavior those people who despise them the most when contemplating them impartially are quite capable of adopting, when actually playing one of life’s vulgar scenes.","And if Françoise then, inspired like a poet with a flood of confused reflections upon bereavement, grief, and family memories, were to plead her inability to rebut my theories, saying: ""I don't know how to espress myself""—I would triumph over her with an ironical and brutal common sense worthy of Dr. Percepied; and if she went on: ""All the same she was a geological relation; there is always the respect due to your geology,"" I would shrug my shoulders and say: ""It is really very good of me to discuss the matter with an illiterate old woman who cannot speak her own language,"" adopting, to deliver judgment on Françoise, the mean and narrow outlook of the pedant, whom those who are most contemptuous of him in the impartiality of their own minds are only too prone to copy when they are obliged to play a part upon the vulgar stage of life."
"Mais elle remarqua que seul Swann ne s’était pas déridé. Du reste il n’était pas très content que Cottard fît rire de lui devant Forcheville. Mais le peintre, au lieu de répondre d’une façon intéressante à Swann, ce qu’il eût probablement fait s’il eût été seul avec lui, préféra se faire admirer des convives en plaçant un morceau sur l’habileté du maître disparu.","But she noticed that only Swann hadn't cheered up. Besides, he was not very happy that Cottard made people laugh at him in front of Forcheville. But the painter, instead of responding in an interesting way to Swann, which he would probably have done if he had been alone with him, preferred to make himself admired by the guests by placing a piece on the skill of the deceased master.","But she noticed that Swann alone had not brightened up. What was more, he was not very pleased that Cottard had made fun of him in front of Forcheville. But the painter, instead of answering Swann in an interesting way, which he probably would have done if he had been alone with him, preferred to win the admiration of the guests by contributing a little set piece on the skill of the deceased master.","But she observed that Swann, and Swann alone, had not unbent. For one thing he was none too well pleased with Cottard for having secured a laugh at his expense in front of Forcheville. But the painter, instead of replying in a way that might have interested Swann, as he would probably have done had they been alone together, preferred to win the easy admiration of the rest by exercising his wit upon the talent of their dead friend."
"Alors Swann la détestait. « Mais aussi, je suis trop bête, se disait-il, je paie avec mon argent le plaisir des autres. Elle fera tout de même bien de faire attention et de ne pas trop tirer sur la corde, car je pourrais bien ne plus rien donner du tout. En tous cas, renonçons provisoirement aux gentillesses supplémentaires ! Penser que pas plus tard qu’hier, comme elle disait avoir envie d’assister à la saison de Bayreuth, j’ai eu la bêtise de lui proposer de louer un des jolis châteaux du roi de Bavière pour nous deux dans les environs. Et d’ailleurs elle n’a pas paru plus ravie que cela, elle n’a encore dit ni oui ni non ; espérons qu’elle refusera, grand Dieu ! Entendre du Wagner pendant quinze jours avec elle qui s’en soucie comme un poisson d’une pomme, ce serait gai ! » Et sa haine, tout comme son amour, ayant besoin de se manifester et d’agir, il se plaisait à pousser de plus en plus loin ses imaginations mauvaises, parce que, grâce aux perfidies qu’il prêtait à Odette, il la détestait davantage et pourrait si – ce qu’il cherchait à se figurer – elles se trouvaient être vraies, avoir une occasion de la punir et d’assouvir sur elle sa rage grandissante. Il alla ainsi jusqu’à supposer qu’il allait recevoir une lettre d’elle où elle lui demanderait de l’argent pour louer ce château près de Bayreuth, mais en le prévenant qu’il n’y pourrait pas venir, parce qu’elle avait promis à Forcheville et aux Verdurin de les inviter.","So Swann hated her. But also, I'm too stupid, he said to himself, I pay with my money for the pleasure of others. She will still do well to be careful and not to pull too much on the rope, because I might not give anything at all. In any case, let's forgo the extra niceties for the time being! To think that just yesterday, as she said she wanted to attend the Bayreuth season, I was stupid enough to offer her to rent one of the beautiful castles of the King of Bavaria for the two of us in the vicinity. And besides, she didn't seem any more delighted than that, she still hadn't said yes or no; let's hope she refuses, good God! To hear Wagner for a fortnight with her, who cares like a fish for an apple, that would be fun! And his hatred, just like his love, needing to manifest itself and to act, he took pleasure in pushing his evil imaginations further and further, because, thanks to the perfidy he ascribed to Odette, he hated her. more and could if – which he was trying to imagine – they happened to be true, have a chance to punish her and to sate his growing rage on her. He went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from her in which she would ask him for money to rent this castle near Bayreuth, but warning him that he could not come there, because she had promised Forcheville and the Verdurins to invite them.","Then Swann detested her. “But also, I’m too stupid,” he would tell himself, “I’m paying with my own money for other people’s pleasures. All the same, she ought to take care and not pull too hard on her bowstring, because I might very well not give anything more at all. In any case, let’s forgo the supplementary favors for the time being! To think that only yesterday, when she said she wanted to attend the season at Bayreuth,83 I was stupid enough to propose renting for the two of us one of the King of Bavaria’s pretty castles in the vicinity. And anyway she did not seem all that delighted, she hasn’t yet said either yes or no; let’s hope she will decide against it. Good Lord! To spend two weeks listening to Wagner with her when she cares as much for it as a fish for an apple—what fun that would be!” And because his hatred, like his love, needed to manifest itself and to act, he took pleasure in pursuing his evil fantasies further and further, since, because of the perfidies he imputed to Odette, he detested her still more and could, if—something he tried to picture to himself— they were found to be true, have an occasion for punishing her and for satiating on her his increasing rage. Thus he went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from her in which she would ask him for money to rent that castle near Bayreuth, but warning him that he could not go there himself, because she had promised Forcheville and the Verdurins that she would invite them.","At such times Swann detested her. "" But I've been a fool, too,"" he would argue. ""I'm paying for other men's pleasures with my money. All the same, she'd better take care, and not pull the string too often, for I might very well stop giving her anything at all. At any rate, we'd better knock off supplementary favours for the time being. To think that, only yesterday, when she said she would like to go to Bayreuth for the season, I was such an ass as to offer to take one of those jolly little places the King of Bavaria has there, for the two of us. However she didn't seem particularly keen; she hasn't said yes or no yet. Let's hope that she'll refuse. Good God! Think of listening to Wagner for a fortnight on end with her, who takes about as much interest in music as a fish does in little apples; it will be fun!"" And his hatred, like his love, needing to manifest itself in action, he amused himself with urging his evil imaginings further and further, because, thanks to the perfidies with which he charged Odette, he detested her still more, and would be able, if it turned out—as he tried to convince himself—that she was indeed guilty of them, to take the opportunity of punishing her, emptying upon her the overflowing vials of his wrath. In this way, he went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from her, in which she would ask him for money to take the house at Bayreuth, but with the warning that he was not to come there himself, as she had promised Forcheville and the Verdurins to invite them."

"Brusquement le souvenir de sa femme morte lui revint, et trouvant sans doute trop compliqué de chercher comment il avait pu à un pareil moment se laisser aller à un mouvement de joie, il se contenta, par un geste qui lui était familier chaque fois qu’une question ardue se présentait à son esprit, de passer la main sur son front, d’essuyer ses yeux et les verres de son lorgnon. Il ne put pourtant pas se consoler de la mort de sa femme, mais pendant les deux années qu’il lui survécut, il disait à mon grand-père : « C’est drôle, je pense très souvent à ma pauvre femme, mais je ne peux y penser beaucoup à la fois. »","Suddenly the memory of his dead wife came back to him, and doubtless finding it too complicated to find out how he had been able at such a moment to give way to a movement of joy, he contented himself, by a gesture which was familiar to him each time an arduous question presented itself to his mind, to pass his hand over his forehead, to wipe his eyes and the lenses of his spectacles. He could not, however, console himself for the death of his wife, but during the two years that he survived her, he said to my grandfather: ""It's funny, I think very often of my poor wife, but I can't think about it much at once. »","Suddenly the memory of his dead wife came back to him and, no doubt feeling it would be too complicated to try to understand how he could have yielded to an impulse of happiness at such a time, he confined himself, in a habitual gesture of his whenever a difficult question came into his mind, to passing his hand over his forehead, wiping his eyes and the lenses of his lorgnon. Yet he could not be consoled for the death of his wife, but, during the two years he survived her, would say to my grandfather: “It’s odd, I think of my poor wife often, but I can’t think of her for long at a time.”","And then, abruptly, the memory of his dead wife returned to him, and probably thinking it too complicated to inquire into how, at such a time, he could have allowed himself to be carried away by an impulse of happiness, he confined himself to a gesture which he habitually employed whenever any perplexing question came into his mind: that is, he passed his hand across his forehead, dried his eyes, and wiped his glasses. And he could never be consoled for the loss of his wife, but used to say to my grandfather, during the two years for which he survived her, ""It's a funny thing, now; I very often think of my poor wife, but I cannot think of her very much at any one time."""
"D’autres fois il lui disait que ce qui plus que tout ferait qu’il cesserait de l’aimer, c’est qu’elle ne voulût pas renoncer à mentir. « Même au simple point de vue de la coquetterie, lui disait-il, ne comprends-tu donc pas combien tu perds de ta séduction en t’abaissant à mentir ? Par un aveu, combien de fautes tu pourrais racheter ! Vraiment tu es bien moins intelligente que je ne croyais ! » Mais c’est en vain que Swann lui exposait ainsi toutes les raisons qu’elle avait de ne pas mentir ; elles auraient pu ruiner chez Odette un système général du mensonge ; mais Odette n’en possédait pas ; elle se contentait seulement, dans chaque cas où elle voulait que Swann ignorât quelque chose qu’elle avait fait, de ne pas le lui dire. Ainsi le mensonge était pour elle un expédient d’ordre particulier ; et ce qui seul pouvait décider si elle devait s’en servir ou avouer la vérité, c’était une raison d’ordre particulier aussi, la chance plus ou moins grande qu’il y avait pour que Swann pût découvrir qu’elle n’avait pas dit la vérité.","Other times he told her that what more than anything would make him stop loving her was that she didn't want to give up lying. “Even from the simple point of view of coquetry,” he said to her, “don’t you understand how much of your seduction you lose by stooping to lying? By a confession, how many faults you could redeem! Really you are much less intelligent than I thought! But it was in vain that Swann explained to her thus all the reasons she had for not lying; they could have ruined a general system of lies in Odette; but Odette had none; she was content only, whenever she wanted Swann to ignore something she had done, not to tell him. Thus lying was for her a special expedient; and the only thing that could decide whether she should use it or confess the truth was a particular reason too, the greater or lesser chance that there was that Swann might discover that she wasn't. hadn't told the truth.","On other occasions he told her that the one thing that was more likely than anything else to make him stop loving her was that she would not give up lying. “Even from the point of view of your desire to be attractive,” he told her, “don’t you understand how much of your charm you lose when you stoop to lying? With one confession, think how many faults you could redeem! Really you are much less intelligent than I thought!” But it was in vain that Swann expounded for her thus all the reasons she had for not lying; they might have undermined some general and systematic approach to lying; but Odette had none; she merely contented herself, whenever she wanted Swann not to know about something she had done, with not telling him about it. And so lying was for her an expedient of a particular order; and the only thing that could decide whether she ought to make use of it or confess the truth was a reason of a particular order too, the greater or lesser likelihood that Swann might discover she had not told the truth.","On other occasions he had assured himself that the one thing which, more than anything else, would make him cease to love her, would be her refusal to abandon the habit of lying. "" Even from the point of view of coquetry, pure and simple,"" he had told her, ""can't you see how much of your attraction you throw away when you stoop to lying? By a frank admission—how many faults you might redeem! Really, you are far less intelligent than I supposed! "" In vain, however, did Swann expound to her thus all the reasons that she had for not lying; they might have succeeded in overthrowing any universal system of mendacity, but Odette had no such system; she contented herself, merely, whenever she wished Swann to remain in ignorance of anything that she had done, with not telling him of it. So that a lie was, to her, something to be used only as a special expedient; and the one thing that could make her decide whether she should avail herself of a lie or not was a reason which, too, was of a special and contingent order, namely the risk of Swann's discovering that she had not told him the truth."
"(elle disait x avec une difficulté affectée et un sourire pour se railler elle-même, ignorante, d’employer ce terme savant), qu’on a fait venir pour Mme Octave et qui voient ce que vous avez dans le cœur », et disparaissait, confuse qu’on s’occupât d’elle, peut-être pour qu’on ne la vît pas pleurer ; maman était la première personne qui lui donnât cette douce émotion de sentir que sa vie, ses bonheurs, ses chagrins de paysanne pouvaient présenter de l’intérêt, être un motif de joie ou de tristesse pour une autre qu’elle-même. Ma tante se résignait à se priver un peu d’elle pendant notre séjour, sachant combien ma mère appréciait le service de cette bonne si intelligente et active, qui était aussi belle dès cinq heures du matin dans sa cuisine, sous son bonnet dont le tuyautage éclatant et fixe avait l’air d’être en biscuit, que pour aller à la grand’messe ; qui faisait tout bien, travaillant comme un cheval, qu’elle fût bien portante ou non, mais sans bruit, sans avoir l’air de rien faire, la seule des bonnes de ma tante qui, quand maman demandait de l’eau chaude ou du café noir, les apportait vraiment bouillants ; elle était un de ces serviteurs qui, dans une maison, sont à la fois ceux qui déplaisent le plus au premier abord à un étranger, peut-être parce qu’ils ne prennent pas la peine de faire sa conquête et n’ont pas pour lui de prévenance, sachant très bien qu’ils n’ont aucun besoin de lui, qu’on cesserait de le recevoir plutôt que de les renvoyer ; et qui sont en revanche ceux à qui tiennent le plus les maîtres qui ont éprouvé leur capacités réelles, et ne se soucient pas de cet agrément superficiel, de ce bavardage servile qui fait favorablement impression à un visiteur, mais qui recouvre souvent une inéducable nullité.","(she said x with affected difficulty and a smile to mock herself, ignorant of using this scholarly term), who have been brought in for Madame Octave and who see what is in your heart"", and disappeared, confused that they were taking care of her, perhaps so that they wouldn't see her cry; Mama was the first person who gave her that sweet emotion of feeling that her life, her happiness, her sorrows as a peasant could be of interest, be a cause of joy or sadness for someone other than herself. My aunt resigned herself to depriving herself a little of her during our stay, knowing how much my mother appreciated the service of this intelligent and active maid, who was also beautiful from five o'clock in the morning in her kitchen, under her cap whose piping dazzling and fixed seemed to be in biscuit, only to go to high mass; who did everything well, working like a horse, healthy or not, but quietly, without seeming to do anything, the only one of my aunt's maids who, when Mama asked for hot water or black coffee, brought them really hot; she was one of those servants who, in a house, are at the same time the ones who most displease a stranger at first sight, perhaps because they do not take the trouble to win her over and do not have the he thoughtfully, knowing very well that they had no need of him, that they would stop receiving him rather than send them away; and who are, on the other hand, those who are most attached to the masters who have tested their real capacities, and who do not care about this superficial pleasantness, this servile chatter which makes a favorable impression on a visitor, but which often conceals an ineducable nullity.","Octave and that see what you have in your heart,” and disappeared, embarrassed that someone was paying attention to her, perhaps so that we would not see her cry; Mama was the first person who gave her that sweet sensation, the feeling that her life as a countrywoman, her joys, her sorrows could be of some interest, could be a reason for pleasure or sadness in someone other than herself. My aunt was resigned to managing with less help from her during our stay, knowing how much my mother appreciated the service of this maid who was so intelligent and active, who was as handsome at five o’clock in the morning in her kitchen, under a bonnet whose dazzling rigid flutes appeared to be made of porcelain, as she was when going to High Mass; who did everything well, working like a horse, whether she was in good health or not, but without a fuss, as though it were nothing, the only one of my aunt’s maids who, when Mama asked for hot water or black coffee, brought them really boiling; she was one of those servants who, in a household, are at the same time those most immediately displeasing to a stranger, perhaps because they do not bother to win him over and are not attentive to him, knowing very well they have no need of him , that one would stop seeing him rather than dismiss them; and who are, on the other hand, those most valued by masters who have tested their real capacities, and do not care about the superficial charm, the servile chatter that makes a favorable impression on a visitor, but that often cloaks an ineducable incompetence.","Octave, which see what is in your heart""—and she went off, disturbed that anyone should be caring about her, perhaps anxious that we should not see her in tears: Mamma was the first person who had given her the pleasure of feeling that her peasant existence, with its simple joys and sorrows, might offer some interest, might be a source of grief or pleasure to some one other than herself. My aunt resigned herself to doing without Françoise to some extent during our visits, knowing how much my mother appreciated the services of so active and intelligent a maid, one who looked as smart at five o'clock in the morning in her kitchen, under a cap whose stiff and dazzling frills seemed to be made of porcelain, as when dressed for churchgoing; who did everything in the right way, who toiled like a horse, whether she was well or ill, but without noise, without the appearance of doing anything; the only one of my aunt's maids who when Mamma asked for hot water or black coffee would bring them actually boiling; she was one of those servants who in a household seem least satisfactory, at first, to a stranger, doubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest of him and shew him no special attention, knowing very well that they have no real need of him, that he will cease to be invited to the house sooner than they will be dismissed from it; who, on the other hand, cling with most fidelity to those masters and mistresses who have tested and proved their real capacity, and do not look for that superficial responsiveness, that slavish affability, which may impress a stranger favourably, but often conceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of training can produce the least trace of individuality."
"Mais au moment même, je ne pouvais apprécier la valeur de ces plaisirs nouveaux.

Même après être rentré à la maison je ne les goûtais pas, car chaque jour, la nécessité qui me faisait espérer que le lendemain j’aurais la contemplation exacte, calme, heureuse de Gilberte, qu’elle m’avouerait enfin son amour, en m’expliquant pour quelles raisons elle avait dû me le cacher jusqu’ici, cette même nécessité me forçait à tenir le passé pour rien, à ne jamais regarder que devant moi, à considérer les petits avantages qu’elle m’avait donnés non pas en eux-mêmes et comme s’ils se suffisaient, mais comme des échelons nouveaux où poser le pied, qui allaient me permettre de faire un pas de plus en avant et d’atteindre enfin le bonheur que je n’avais pas encore rencontré.","But at the same time, I could not appreciate the value of these new pleasures.

Even after returning home I did not taste them, because every day, the necessity that made me hope that the next day I would have the exact, calm, happy contemplation of Gilberte, that she would finally confess her love to me, in explaining to me why she had had to hide it from me until now, this same necessity forced me to regard the past as nothing, to never look except in front of me, to consider the little advantages that she had given me not in themselves and as if they were enough, but as new rungs on which to set foot, which were going to allow me to take another step forward and finally reach the happiness I had not yet encountered.","But in the moment itself, I could not appreciate the value of these new pleasures.

Hélas ! il sentait bien qu’avec l’argent qu’elle avait, ou qu’elle trouverait facilement, elle pourrait tout de même louer à Bayreuth puisqu’elle en avait envie, elle qui n’était pas capable de faire de différence entre Bach et Clapisson. Mais elle y vivrait malgré tout plus chichement.","So this terrible answer, every word of which he had stopped the day before without daring to hope that it could ever be used, he had the joy of conveying to her. Alas! he felt that with the money she had, or that she could find easily, she could all the same rent in Bayreuth since she wanted to, she who was not able to make a difference between Bach and Clapisson. But she would still live there more sparingly.","And so that terrible answer, whose every word he had determined the day before without daring to hope that it would ever be used, he could now have the joy of sending off to her. Alas! He was quite aware that, all the same, with the money she had, or that she might easily find, she could rent something at Bayreuth since she wanted to, she who was incapable of telling the difference between Bach and Clapisson.84 But still, she would live there more frugally.","Then that annihilating answer, every word of which he had carefully rehearsed overnight, without venturing to hope that it could ever be used, he had the satisfaction of having it conveyed to her. Alas! he felt only too certain that with the money which she had, or could easily procure, she would be able, all the same, to take a house at Bayreuth, since she wished to do so, she who was incapable of distinguishing between Bach and Clapisson. Let her take it, then; she would have to live in it more frugally, that was all."
"– Mais ce sera un bonheur… , commençait à répondre Swann, quand le docteur l’interrompit d’un air moqueur. En effet, ayant retenu que dans la conversation l’emphase, l’emploi de formes solennelles, était suranné, dès qu’il entendait un mot grave dit sérieusement comme venait de l’être le mot « bonheur », il croyait que celui qui l’avait prononcé venait de se montrer prudhommesque. Et si, de plus, ce mot se trouvait figurer par hasard dans ce qu’il appelait un vieux cliché, si courant que ce mot fût d’ailleurs, le docteur supposait que la phrase commencée était ridicule et la terminait ironiquement par le lieu commun qu’il semblait accuser son interlocuteur d’avoir voulu placer, alors que celui-ci n’y avait jamais pensé.","“But it will be a joy…” was beginning to reply Swann, when the doctor interrupted him with a mocking air. Indeed, having remembered that in conversation the emphasis, the use of solemn forms, was outdated, as soon as he heard a serious word said seriously as the word ""happiness"" had just been said, he believed that the one who had uttered it had just shown himself prudhommesque. And if, moreover, this word happened to appear by chance in what he called an old cliche, however common this word was, the doctor supposed that the sentence begun was ridiculous and ended it ironically with the commonplace that he seemed to accuse his interlocutor of having wanted to place, when the latter had never thought of it.","“Why, it would be a joy . . .” Swann was beginning to answer, when the doctor interrupted him with a mocking look. In fact, having acquired the notion that in conversation, to be emphatic, to employ formal expressions was old-fashioned, as soon as he heard a solemn word used seriously, as the word joy had just been used, he thought the person who haduttered it had just been guilty of pomposity. And if, in addition, the word happened to occur in what he called an old cliché, however current it might be in other respects, the doctor would assume that the sentence that had been begun was ridiculous and would finish it ironically using the platitude he seemed to be accusing the speaker of having wanted to deploy, although the latter had never thought of it.","""I should count myself most fortunate..."" Swann was beginning, a trifle pompously, when the Doctor broke in derisively. Having once heard it said, and never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis and the use of formal expressions were out of date, whenever he heard a solemn word used seriously, as the word 'fortunate' had been used just now by Swann, he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately pedantic. And if, moreover, the same word happened to occur, also, in what he called an old 'tag' or 'saw,' however common it might still be in current usage, the Doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole thing was a joke, and interrupted with the remaining words of the quotation, which he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended to introduce at that point, although in reality it had never entered his mind."

"Saniette qui, depuis qu’il avait rendu précipitamment au maître d’hôtel son assiette encore pleine, s’était replongé dans un silence méditatif, en sortit enfin pour raconter en riant l’histoire d’un dîner qu’il avait fait avec le duc de La Trémoïlle et d’où il résultait que celui-ci ne savait pas que George Sand était le pseudonyme d’une femme. Swann, qui avait de la sympathie pour Saniette, crut devoir lui donner sur la culture du duc des détails montrant qu’une telle ignorance de la part de celui-ci était matériellement impossible ; mais tout d’un coup il s’arrêta, il venait de comprendre que Saniette n’avait pas besoin de ces preuves et savait que l’histoire était fausse pour la raison qu’il venait de l’inventer il y avait un moment. Cet excellent homme souffrait d’être trouvé si ennuyeux par les Verdurin ; et ayant conscience d’avoir été plus terne encore à ce dîner que d’habitude, il n’avait voulu le laisser finir sans avoir réussi à amuser. Il capitula si vite, eut l’air si malheureux de voir manqué l’effet sur lequel il avait compté et répondit d’un ton si lâche à Swann pour que celui-ci ne s’acharnât pas à une réfutation désormais inutile : « C’est bon, c’est bon ; en tous cas, même si je me trompe, ce n’est pas un crime, je pense »","Saniette who, since he had hurriedly returned his still full plate to the butler, had plunged back into a meditative silence, finally came out to tell, laughing, the story of a dinner he had had with the Duke of La Trémoïlle and from which it resulted that he did not know that George Sand was the pseudonym of a woman. Swann, who was sympathetic to Saniette, thought it his duty to give him details of the Duke's culture showing that such ignorance on his part was materially impossible; but suddenly he stopped, he had just understood that Saniette did not need this proof and knew that the story was false for the reason that he had just invented it a moment ago. This excellent man suffered from being found so dull by the Verdurins; and being aware that he had been even duller than usual at this dinner, he had not wanted to let it end without having succeeded in amusing him. He capitulated so quickly, looked so unhappy to see the effect he had counted on missed, and replied in such a cowardly tone to Swann so that the latter would not insist on a now useless refutation: ""C is good, it is good; in any case, even if I'm wrong, it's not a crime, I think ""","Saniette, who, after hurriedly giving the butler his plate, which was still full, had plunged back into a meditative silence, emerged from it at last to tell them with a smile the story of a dinner he had attended with the Duc de La Trémoïlle at which it turned out that the Duc did not know George Sand was the pseudonym of a woman. Swann, who was fond of Saniette, thought he ought to supply him with a few particulars about the Duc’s culture proving that such ignorance on the latter’s part was materially impossible; but suddenly he stopped, realizing that Saniette did not need these proofs and knew the story was untrue for the simple reason that he had just invented it a moment ago. That excellent man suffered from being thought such a bore by the Verdurins; and, aware that he had been even duller than usual at this dinner, he had not wanted to let it end before he succeeded in amusing them. He capitulated so quickly, looked so unhappy at seeing that the effect on which he had counted had failed, and answered Swann in such a pitiful tone so that Swann would not persist in a refutation that was henceforth pointless, “ All right, all right; and if I’m mistaken it ’s","Saniette who, ever since he had surrendered his untouched plate to the butler, had been plunged once more in silent meditation, emerged finally to tell them, with a nervous laugh, a story of how he had once dined with the Duc de La Trémoïlle, the point of which was that the Duke did not know that George Sand was the pseudonym of a woman. Swann, who really liked Saniette, felt bound to supply him with a few facts illustrative of the Duke's culture, which would prove that such ignorance on his part was literally impossible; but suddenly he stopped short; he had realised, as he was speaking, that Saniette needed no proof, but knew already that the story was untrue for the simple reason that he had at that moment invented it. The worthy man suffered acutely from the Verdurins' always finding him so dull; and as he was conscious of having been more than ordinarily morose this evening, he had made up his mind that he would succeed in being amusing, at least once, before the end of dinner. He surrendered so quickly, looked so wretched at the sight of his castle in ruins, and replied in so craven a tone to Swann, appealing to him not to persist in a refutation which was already superfluous, ""All right; all right; anyhow, even if I have made a mistake that's not a crime, I hope,"" that Swann longed to be able to console him by insisting that the story was indubitably true and exquisitely funny."

"Sans me dire que ce qui était caché derrière les clochers de Martinville devait être quelque chose d’analogue à une jolie phrase, puisque c’était sous la forme de mots qui me faisaient plaisir que cela m’était apparu, demandant un crayon et du papier au docteur, je composai malgré les cahots de la voiture, pour soulager ma conscience et obéir à mon enthousiasme, le petit morceau suivant que j’ai retrouvé depuis et auquel je n’ai eu à faire subir que peu de changements : « Seuls, s’élevant du niveau de la plaine et comme perdus en rase campagne, montaient vers le ciel les deux clochers de Martinville. Bientôt nous en vîmes trois : venant se placer en face d’eux par une volte hardie, un clocher retardataire, celui de Vieuxvicq, les avait rejoints. Les minutes passaient, nous allions vite et pourtant les trois clochers étaient toujours au loin devant nous, comme trois oiseaux posés sur la plaine, immobiles et qu’on distingue au soleil. Puis le clocher de Vieuxvicq s’écarta, prit ses distances, et les clochers de Martinville restèrent seuls, éclairés par la lumière du couchant que même à cette distance, sur leurs pentes, je voyais jouer et sourire. Nous avions été si longs à nous rapprocher d’eux, que je pensais au temps qu’il faudrait encore pour les atteindre quand, tout d’un coup, la voiture ayant tourné, elle nous déposa à leurs pieds ; et ils s’étaient jetés si rudement au-devant d’elle, qu’on n’eut que le temps d’arrêter pour ne pas se heurter au porche. Nous poursuivîmes notre route ; nous avions déjà quitté Martinville depuis un peu de temps et le village après nous avoir accompagnés quelques secondes avait disparu, que restés seuls à l’horizon à nous regarder fuir, ces clochers et celui de Vieuxvicq agitaient encore en signe d’adieu leurs cimes ensoleillées. Parfois l’un s’effaçait pour que les deux autres pussent nous apercevoir un instant encore ; mais la route changea de direction, ils virèrent dans la lumière comme trois pivots d’or et disparurent à mes yeux. Mais, un peu plus tard, comme nous étions déjà près de Combray, le soleil étant maintenant couché, je les aperçus une dernière fois de très loin, qui n’étaient plus que comme trois fleurs peintes sur le ciel au-dessus de la ligne basse des champs. Ils me faisaient penser aussi aux trois jeunes filles d’une légende, abandonnées dans une solitude où tombait déjà l’obscurité ; et tandis que nous nous éloignions au galop, je les vis timidement chercher leur chemin et après quelques gauches trébuchements de leurs nobles silhouettes, se serrer les uns contre les autres, glisser l’un derrière l’autre, ne plus faire sur le ciel encore rose qu’une seule forme noire, charmante et résignée, et s’effacer dans la nuit. « Je ne repensai jamais à cette page, mais à ce moment-là, quand, au coin du siège où le cocher du docteur plaçait habituellement dans un panier les volailles qu’il avait achetées au marché de Martinville, j’eus fini de l’écrire, je me trouvai si heureux, je sentais qu’elle m’avait si parfaitement débarrassé de ces clochers et de ce qu’ils cachaient derrière eux, que comme si j’avais été moi-même une poule et si je venais de pondre un œuf, je me mis à chanter à tue-tête.","Without telling me that what was hidden behind the steeples of Martinville must have been something analogous to a pretty phrase, since it was in the form of words that gave me pleasure that it appeared to me, asking for a pencil and paper to the doctor, I composed despite the jolting of the car, to ease my conscience and obey my enthusiasm, the following little piece which I have since found and to which I have had to undergo only a few changes: ""Alone , rising from the level of the plain and as if lost in open country, rose towards the sky the two steeples of Martinville. Soon we saw three of them: coming to stand in front of them by a bold volte, a belated steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, had joined them. The minutes passed, we were going fast and yet the three steeples were still far ahead of us, like three birds perched on the plain, motionless and distinguishable in the sun. Then the steeple of Vieuxvicq parted, took its distance, and the steeples of Martinville remained alone, lit by the light of the setting sun which even at this distance, on their slopes, I saw playing and smiling. We had taken so long to approach them that I was thinking how long it would still take to reach them when, suddenly, the car having turned, it set us down at their feet; and they had thrown themselves so roughly in front of her that they barely had time to stop so as not to run into the porch. We continued on our way; we had already left Martinville a little while ago and the village, after having accompanied us for a few seconds, had disappeared, that, left alone on the horizon to watch us flee, these steeples and that of Vieuxvicq still waved their sunny summits as a sign of farewell . Sometimes one stood aside so that the other two could see us for a moment longer; but the road changed direction, they veered into the light like three golden pivots and disappeared from my sight. But, a little later, as we were already near Combray, the sun having now set, I saw them one last time from very far away, which were no more than three flowers painted on the sky above the line low fields. They also made me think of the three young girls of a legend, abandoned in a solitude where darkness was already falling; and while we galloped away, I saw them timidly seek their way and after a few awkward stumbles of their noble silhouettes, huddle together, slide one behind the other, no longer do on the sky again rose just a single black shape, charming and resigned, and fade into the night. ""I never thought of that page again, but at that moment, when, at the corner of the seat where the doctor's coachman usually placed in a basket the poultry he had bought at the Martinville market, I had finished reading it. writing, I found myself so happy, I felt that she had so perfectly rid me of these steeples and what they hid behind them, that as if I had been a hen myself and had just lay an egg, I began to sing at the top of my voice.","Without saying to myself that what was hidden behind the steeples of Martinville had to be something analogous to a pretty sentence, since it had appeared to me in the form of words that gave me pleasure, I asked the doctor for a pencil and some paper and I composed, despite the jolts of the carriage, and in order to ease my conscience and yield to my enthusiasm, the following little piece that I have since found again and that I have not had to submit to more than a few changes: “Alone, rising from the level of the plain, and appearing lost in the open country, the two steeples of Martinville ascended toward the sky. Soon we saw three : wheeling around boldly to position itself opposite them, the laggard steeple of Vieuxvicq had come along to join them. The minutes were passing, we were going fast, and yet the three steeples were still far away ahead of us, like three birds poised on the plain, motionless, distinguishable in the sunlight. Then the steeple of Vieuxvicq moved away, receded into the distance, and the steeples of Martinville remained alone, illuminated by the light of the setting sun, which even at that distance I saw playing and smiling on their sloping sides. We had taken so long approaching them that I was thinking about the time we would still need in order to reach them, when suddenly the carriage turned and set us down at their feet; and they had flung themselves so roughly in front of it that we had only just time to stop in order not to run into the porch. We continued on our way; we had already left Martinville a little while before, and the village, after accompanying us for a few seconds, had disappeared, when, lingering alone on the horizon to watch us flee, its steeples and that of Vieuxvicq still waved good-bye with their sunlit tops. At times one of them would draw aside so that the other two could glimpse us again for an instant; but the road changed direction, they swung around in the light like three golden pivots and disappeared from my gaze. But a little later, when we were already close to Combray, and the sun had set, I caught sight of them one last time from very far away, seeming now no more than three flowers painted on the sky above the low line of the fields. They reminded me, too, of the three young girls in a legend, abandoned in a solitary place where darkness was already falling; and while we moved off at a gallop, I saw them timidly seek their way and, after some awkward stumbling of their noble silhouettes, press against one another, slip behind one another, now forming, against the still pink sky, no more than a single black shape, charming and resigned, and fade away into the night.” I never thought of this page again, but at that moment, when in the corner of the seat where the doctor’s coachman usually placed in a basket the poultry he had bought at the market in Martinville, I had finished writing it, I was so happy , I felt it had so perfectly relieved me of those steeples and what they had been hiding behind them, that, as if I myself were a hen and had just laid an egg, I began to sing at the top of my voice.","Without admitting to myself that what lay buried within the steeples of Martinville must be something analogous to a charming phrase, since it was in the form of words which gave me pleasure that it had appeared to me, I borrowed a pencil and some paper from the Doctor, and composed, in spite of the jolting of the carriage, to appease my conscience and to satisfy my enthusiasm, the following little fragment, which I have since discovered, and now reproduce, with only a slight revision here and there. * * * Alone, rising from the level of the plain, and seemingly lost in that expanse of open country, climbed to the sky the twin steeples of Martinville. Presently we saw three: springing into position confronting them by a daring volt, a third, a dilatory steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, was come to join them. The minutes passed, we were moving rapidly, and yet the three steeples were always a long way ahead of us, like three birds perched upon the plain, motionless and conspicuous in the sunlight. Then the steeple of Vieuxvicq withdrew, took its proper distance, and the steeples of Martinville remained alone, gilded by the light of the setting sun, which, even at that distance, I could see playing and smiling upon their sloped sides. We had been so long in approaching them that I was thinking of the time that must still elapse before we could reach them when, of a sudden, the carriage, having turned a corner, set us down at their feet; and they had flung themselves so abruptly in our path that we had barely time to stop before being dashed against the porch of the church. We resumed our course; we had left Martinville some little time, and the village, after accompanying us for a few seconds, had already disappeared, when, lingering alone on the horizon to watch our flight, its steeples and that of Vieuxvicq waved once again, in token of farewell, their sun-bathed pinnacles. Sometimes one would withdraw, so that the other two might watch us for a moment still; then the road changed direction, they veered in the light like three golden pivots, and vanished from my gaze. But, a little later, when we were already close to Combray, the sun having set meanwhile, I caught sight of them for the last time, far away, and seeming no more now than three flowers painted upon the sky above the low line of fields. They made me think, too, of three maidens in a legend, abandoned in a solitary place over which night had begun to fall; and while we drew away from them at a gallop, I could see them timidly seeking their way, and, after some awkward, stumbling movements of their noble silhouettes, drawing close to one another, slipping one behind another, shewing nothing more, now, against the still rosy sky than a single dusky form, charming and resigned, and so vanishing in the night. * * * I never thought again of this page, but at the moment when, on my corner of the box-seat, where the Doctor's coachman was in the habit of placing, in a hamper, the fowls which he had bought at Martinville market , I had finished writing it, I found such a sense of happiness, felt that it had so entirely relieved my mind of the obsession of the steeples, and of the mystery which they concealed, that, as though I myself were a hen and had just laid an egg, I began to sing at the top of my voice."
"Le pianiste ayant terminé le morceau de Liszt et ayant commencé un prélude de Chopin, Mme de Cambremer lança à Mme de Franquetot un sourire attendri de satisfaction compétente et d’allusion au passé.

"« Pensez à le remercier intelligiblement de son vin, vous savez qu’il est délicieux et la caisse est énorme », recommanda mon grand-père à ses deux belles-sœurs. « Ne commencez pas à chuchoter, dit ma grand’tante. Comme c’est confortable d’arriver dans une maison où tout le monde parle bas. » – « Ah ! voilà M. Swann. Nous allons lui demander s’il croit qu’il fera beau demain », dit mon père. Ma mère pensait qu’un mot d’elle effacerait toute la peine que dans notre famille on avait pu faire à Swann depuis son mariage. Elle trouva le moyen de l’emmener un peu à l’écart. Mais je la suivis ; je ne pouvais me décider à la quitter d’un pas en pensant que tout à l’heure il faudrait que je la laisse dans la salle à manger et que je remonte dans ma chambre sans avoir comme les autres soirs la consolation qu’elle vînt m’embrasser.","""Remember to thank him intelligibly for his wine, you know it's delicious and the case is huge,"" recommended my grandfather to his two sisters-in-law.

We are going to ask him if he thinks the weather will be nice tomorrow,” my father said. My mother thought that a word from her would erase all the pain our family had caused Swann since his marriage. She found a way to take him a little aside. But I followed her; I couldn't make up my mind to take one step away from her, thinking that later on I would have to leave her in the dining room and go back to my room without having the consolation that she was coming, as on other evenings. Kiss me.","“Remember to thank him intelligibly for the wine, you know how delicious it is and the case is enormous,” my grandfather exhorted his two sisters-in-law. “Don’t start whispering,” said my great-aunt. “How comfortable would you feel arriving at a house where everyone is speaking so quietly!” “Ah! Here’s M. Swann. Let’s ask him if he thinks the weather will be good tomorrow,” said my father. My mother thought that one word from her would wipe out all the pain that we in our family might have caused Swann since his marriage. She found an opportunity to take him aside.

""Let's ask him if he thinks it will be fine to-morrow."" My mother fancied that a word from her would wipe out all the unpleasantness which my family had contrived to make Swann feel since his marriage. She found an opportunity to draw him aside for a moment. But I followed her: I could not bring myself to let her go out of reach of me while I felt that in a few minutes I should have to leave her in the dining-room and go up to my bed without the consoling thought, as on ordinary evenings, that she would come up, later, to kiss me."

"Le cocher, qui ne semblait pas disposé à causer, ayant à peine répondu à mes propos, force me fut, faute d’autre compagnie, de me rabattre sur celle de moi-même et d’essayer de me rappeler mes clochers. Bientôt, leurs lignes et leurs surfaces ensoleillées, comme si elles avaient été une sorte d’écorce, se déchirèrent, un peu de ce qui m’était caché en elles m’apparut, j’eus une pensée qui n’existait pas pour moi l’instant avant, qui se formula en mots dans ma tête, et le plaisir que m’avait fait tout à l’heure éprouver leur vue s’en trouva tellement accru que, pris d’une sorte d’ivresse, je ne pus plus penser à autre chose. À ce moment et comme nous étions déjà loin de Martinville, en tournant la tête je les aperçus de nouveau, tout noirs cette fois, car le soleil était déjà couché. Par moments les tournants du chemin me les dérobaient, puis ils se montrèrent une dernière fois et enfin je ne les vis plus.","The coachman, who did not seem disposed to talk, having scarcely replied to my remarks, was forced, for lack of other company, to fall back on that of myself and to try to remember my steeples. Soon their lines and their sunny surfaces, as if they had been a kind of bark, tore, a little of what was hidden from me in them appeared to me, I had a thought that did not exist for me the moment before, which was formulated in words in my head, and the pleasure that I had just experienced in seeing them was so increased that, seized with a kind of intoxication, I could not no longer think of anything else. At that moment and as we were already far from Martinville, turning my head I saw them again, quite black this time, because the sun had already set. At times the bends in the road hid them from me, then they showed themselves one last time and finally I saw them no more.","Since the coachman, who did not seem inclined to talk, had hardly answered anything I said, I was obliged, for lack of other company, to fall back on my own and try to recall my steeples. Soon their lines and their sunlit surfaces split apart, as if they were a sort of bark, a little of what was hidden from me inside them appeared to me, I had a thought which had not existed a moment before, which took shape in words in my head, and the pleasure I had just recently experienced at the sight of them was so increased by this that, seized by a sort of drunkenness, I could no longer think of anything else. At that moment, as we were already far away from Martinville, turning my head I caught sight of them again, quite black this time, for the sun had already set. At moments the bends of the road would hide them from me, then they showed themselves one last time, and finally I did not see them again.","The coachman, who seemed little inclined for conversation, having barely acknowledged my remarks, I was obliged, in default of other society, to fall back on my own, and to attempt to recapture the vision of my steeples. And presently their outlines and their sunlit surface, as though they had been a sort of rind, were stripped apart; a little of what they had concealed from me became apparent; an idea came into my mind which had not existed for me a moment earlier, framed itself in words in my head; and the pleasure with which the first sight of them, just now, had filled me was so much enhanced that, overpowered by a sort of intoxication, I could no longer think of anything but them. At this point, although we had now travelled a long way from Martinville, I turned my head and caught sight of them again, quite black this time, for the sun had meanwhile set. Every few minutes a turn in the road would sweep them out of sight; then they shewed themselves for the last time, and so I saw them no more."
"M. Verdurin avait d’ailleurs fait sagement en ne retirant pas sa pipe de sa bouche, car Cottard qui avait besoin de s’éloigner un instant fit à mi-voix une plaisanterie qu’il avait apprise depuis peu et qu’il renouvelait chaque fois qu’il avait à aller au même endroit : « Il faut que j’aille entretenir un instant le duc d’Aumale », de sorte que la quinte de M. Verdurin recommença.","M. Verdurin had, moreover, acted wisely in not removing his pipe from his mouth, for Cottard, who needed to go away for a moment, whispered a joke which he had recently learned and which he repeated each time. time he had to go to the same place: ""I must go and talk to the Duc d'Aumale for a moment,"" so that M. Verdurin's fit began again.","M. Verdurin had in fact been wise not to withdraw his pipe from his mouth, for Cottard, who needed to leave the room for a moment, made a joke under his breath that he had learned recently and that he repeated each time he had to go to the same place: “I must absent myself for a moment in aid of the Duc d’Aumale,”63 so that M. Verdurin’s fit began again.","M. Verdurin had been wiser than he knew in not taking his pipe out of his mouth, for Cottard, having occasion to leave the room for a moment, murmured a witty euphemism which he had recently acquired and repeated now whenever he had to go to the place in question: ""I must just go and see the Duc d'Aumale for a minute,"" so drolly, that M. Verdurin's cough began all over again."
"– C’est drôle qu’il aille même chez la mère Saint-Euverte, dit Mme de Gallardon.

"Il se trompait. Il devait la revoir une fois encore, quelques semaines plus tard. Ce fut en dormant, dans le crépuscule d’un rêve. Il se promenait avec MmeVerdurin, le docteur Cottard, un jeune homme en fez qu’il ne pouvait identifier, le peintre, Odette, Napoléon III et mon grand-père, sur un chemin qui suivait la mer et la surplombait à pic tantôt de très haut, tantôt de quelques mètres seulement, de sorte qu’on montait et redescendait constamment ; ceux des promeneurs qui redescendaient déjà n’étaient plus visibles à ceux qui montaient encore, le peu de jour qui restât faiblissait et il semblait alors qu’une nuit noire allait s’étendre immédiatement. Par moment les vagues sautaient jusqu’au bord, et Swann, sentait sur sa joue des éclaboussures glacées. Odette lui disait de les essuyer, il ne pouvait pas et en était confus vis-à-vis d’elle, ainsi que d’être en chemise de nuit. Il espérait qu’à cause de l’obscurité on ne s’en rendait pas compte, mais cependant MmeVerdurin le fixa d’un regard étonné durant un long moment pendant lequel il vit sa figure se déformer, son nez s’allonger et qu’elle avait de grandes moustaches. Il se détourna pour regarder Odette, ses joues étaient pâles, avec des petits points rouges, ses traits tirés, cernés, mais elle le regardait avec des yeux pleins de tendresse prêts à se détacher comme des larmes pour tomber sur lui, et il se sentait l’aimer tellement qu’il aurait voulu l’emmener tout de suite. Tout d’un coup Odette tourna son poignet, regarda une petite montre et dit : « Il faut que je m’en aille », elle prenait congé de tout le monde, de la même façon, sans prendre à part Swann, sans lui dire où elle le reverrait le soir ou un autre jour. Il n’osa pas le lui demander, il aurait voulu la suivre et était obligé, sans se retourner vers elle, de répondre en souriant à une question de MmeVerdurin, mais son cœur battait horriblement, il éprouvait de la haine pour Odette, il aurait voulu crever ses yeux qu’il aimait tant tout à l’heure, écraser ses joues sans fraîcheur. Il continuait à monter avec MmeVerdurin, c’est-à-dire à s’éloigner à chaque pas d’Odette, qui descendait en sens inverse. Au bout d’une seconde il y eut beaucoup d’heures qu’elle était partie. Le peintre fit remarquer à Swann que Napoléon III s’était éclipsé un instant après elle. « C’était certainement entendu entre eux, ajouta-t-il, ils ont dû se rejoindre en bas de la côte, mais n’ont pas voulu dire adieu ensemble à cause des convenances. Elle est sa maîtresse. » Le jeune homme inconnu se mit à pleurer. Swann essaya de le consoler.","He was wrong. He was to see her again, a few weeks later. It was while sleeping, in the twilight of a dream. He was walking with Madame Verdurin, Doctor Cottard, a young man in a fez whom he could not identify, the painter, Odette, Napoleon III and my grandfather, on a path that followed the sea and sometimes overlooked it very high, sometimes only a few meters, so that we were constantly going up and down; those of the walkers who were already going down were no longer visible to those who were still going up, the little daylight that remained was weakening and it seemed then that a dark night was going to spread immediately. At times the waves jumped to the edge, and Swann felt icy splashes on his cheek. Odette told him to wipe them off, he couldn't and was confused about her, as well as being in his nightgown. He hoped that because of the darkness no one would notice it, but nevertheless Madame Verdurin stared at him with astonishment for a long moment during which he saw her face distort, her nose lengthen and that she had big mustaches. He turned away to look at Odette, her cheeks were pale, with little red dots, her features drawn, dark circles, but she looked at him with eyes full of tenderness ready to break away like tears to fall on him, and he felt love her so much that he wanted to take her away right away. Suddenly Odette turned her wrist, looked at a small watch and said: ""I have to go"", she was saying goodbye to everyone, in the same way, without taking Swann aside, without telling him where she would see him again in the evening or another day. He didn't dare ask her, he would have liked to follow her and was obliged, without turning towards her, to answer Madame Verdurin's question with a smile, but his heart was beating horribly, he felt hatred for Odette, he would have wanted to gouge out his eyes that he loved so much just now, crush his lackluster cheeks. He continued to climb with Madame Verdurin, that is to say, to move away with each step of Odette, who was descending in the opposite direction. After a second she had been gone for many hours. The painter pointed out to Swann that Napoleon III had slipped away a moment after her. “It was certainly understood between them, he added, they had to meet at the bottom of the hill, but did not want to say goodbye together because of the proprieties. She is his mistress. The unknown young man began to cry. Swann tried to console him.","He was mistaken. He did see see her again, one more time, a few weeks later. It was while he was asleep, in the twilight of a dream. He was walking with Mme. Verdurin, Dr. Cottard, a young man in a fez whom he could not identify, the painter, Odette, Napoleon III, and my grandfather, along a path that followed the sea and overhung it steeply sometimes very high up, sometimes by a few yards only, so that one climbed and descended again constantly; those who were descending again were already no longer visible to those who were still climbing, what little daylight remained was failing, and it seemed then as though a profound darkness was going to spread over them at any moment. Now and again the waves leaped right up to the edge and Swann felt sprays of icy water on his cheek. Odette told him to wipe them off, he could not and was embarrassed by this in front of her, as he was embarrassed to be in his nightshirt. He hoped that in the darkness no one would realize, but Mme. Verdurin stared at him with a look of surprise for a long moment during which he saw her face change shape, her nose lengthen, and that she had a large mustache. He turned away to look at Odette, her cheeks were pale, with little red spots, her features drawn, ringed with shadows, but she was looking at him with eyes full of tenderness that were about to separate from her like teardrops and fall on him, and he felt he loved her so much that he wanted to take her away at once. Suddenly Odette turned her wrist, looked at a little watch, and said: “I have to go,” she said good-bye to everyone, in the same manner, without taking Swann aside, without telling him where she would see him again that evening or another day. He did not dare ask her, he would have liked to follow her and was obliged, without turning back toward her, to answer with a smile some question of Mme. Verdurin ’s, but his heart was pounding horribly, he felt he hated Odette, he would have liked to cut out those eyes of hers that he had loved so much just a moment ago, crush those pallid cheeks. He continued to climb with Mme. Verdurin, which meant that with each step he moved farther away from Odette, who was descending in the opposite direction. After one second, it was many hours ago that she had left them. The painter remarked to Swann that Napoleon III had vanished an instant after she had. “They certainly must have arranged it together,” he added. “They must have met at the bottom of the hill, but they didn’t want to say good-bye at the same time for the sake of appearances. She’s obviously his mistress.” The unknown young man began to cry. Swann tried to comfort him.","He was mistaken. He was destined to see her once again, a few weeks later. It was while he was asleep, in the twilight of a dream. He was walking with Mme. Verdurin, Dr. Cottard, a young man in a fez whom he failed to identify, the painter, Odette, Napoleon III and my grandfather, along a path which followed the line of the coast, and overhung the sea, now at a great height, now by a few feet only, so that they were continually going up and down; those of the party who had reached the downward slope were no longer visible to those who were still climbing; what little daylight yet remained was failing, and it seemed as though a black night was immediately to fall on them. Now and then the waves dashed against the cliff, and Swann could feel on his cheek a shower of freezing spray. Odette told him to wipe this off, but he could not, and felt confused and helpless in her company, as well as because he was in his nightshirt. He hoped that, in the darkness, this might pass unnoticed; Mme. Verdurin, however, fixed her astonished gaze upon him for an endless moment, in which he saw her face change its shape, her nose grow longer, while beneath it there sprouted a heavy moustache. He turned away to examine Odette; her cheeks were pale, with little fiery spots, her features drawn and ringed with shadows; but she looked back at him with eyes welling with affection, ready to detach themselves like tears and to fall upon his face, and he felt that he loved her so much that he would have liked to carry her off with him at once. Suddenly Odette turned her wrist, glanced at a tiny watch, and said: ""I must go. "" She took leave of everyone, in the same formal manner, without taking Swann aside, without telling him where they were to meet that evening, or next day. He dared not ask, he would have liked to follow her, he was obliged, without turning back in her direction, to answer with a smile some question by Mme. Verdurin ; but his heart was frantically beating, he felt that he now hated Odette, he would gladly have crushed those eyes which, a moment ago, he had loved so dearly, have torn the blood into those lifeless cheeks. He continued to climb with Mme. Verdurin, that is to say that each step took him farther from Odette, who was going downhill, and in the other direction. A second passed and it was many hours since she had left him. The painter remarked to Swann that Napoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately after Odette. ""They had obviously arranged it between them,"" he added; ""they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff, but they wouldn't say good-bye together; it might have looked odd. She is his mistress. "" The strange young man burst into tears. Swann endeavoured to console him."
"Que ne répondait-il du moins comme Forcheville : « Dame, c’est une duchesse ! il y a des gens que ça impressionne encore », ce qui aurait permis au moins à MmeVerdurin de répliquer : « Grand bien leur fasse ! » Au lieu de cela, Swann se contenta de rire d’un air qui signifiait qu’il ne pouvait même pas prendre au sérieux une pareille extravagance. M. Verdurin, continuant à jeter sur sa femme des regards furtifs, voyait avec tristesse et comprenait trop bien qu’elle éprouvait la colère d’un grand inquisiteur qui ne parvient pas à extirper l’hérésie, et pour tâcher d’amener Swann à une rétractation, comme le courage de ses opinions paraît toujours un calcul et une lâcheté aux yeux de ceux à l’encontre de qui il s’exerce, M. Verdurin l’interpella : – Dites donc franchement votre pensée, nous n’irons pas le leur répéter.","Why not answer at least like Forcheville: ""Lady, she's a duchess!"" there are people that it still impresses”, which would have allowed at least Mrs. Verdurin to reply: “Great good for them! Instead, Swann just laughed in a way that meant he couldn't even take such an extravagance seriously. M. Verdurin, continuing to cast furtive glances at his wife, saw with sadness and understood only too well that she felt the wrath of a Grand Inquisitor who does not manage to eradicate heresy, and to try to bring Swann to a retraction, as the courage of his opinions always seems calculated and cowardly in the eyes of those against whom it is exercised, M. Verdurin challenged him: repeat it to them.","But he might at least have answered like Forcheville: “Lord, she’s a duchess; some people are still impressed by that,” which had at least allowed Mme. Verdurin to reply: “Much good may it do them!” Instead of that, Swann merely laughed with an air that signified that he could not even take such extravagant nonsense seriously. M. Verdurin, continuing to cast furtive glances at his wife, saw with sadness and understood all too well that she was feeling the rage of a grand inquisitor who cannot manage to extirpate the heresy, and in order to try to lead Swann to a recantation, since the courage of one’s convictions always seem to be a calculation and an act of cowardice in the eyes of those who do not share them, M. Verdurin challenged him: “Now tell us frankly what you think of them, we won’t repeat it to them.”","But he might, at least, have replied, like Forcheville: ""Gad, she's a duchess; there are still plenty of people who are impressed by that sort of thing,"" which would at least have permitted Mme. Verdurin the final retort, ""And a lot of good may it do them!"" Instead of which, Swann merely smiled, in a manner which shewed, quite clearly, that he could not, of course, take such an absurd suggestion seriously. M. Verdurin, who was still casting furtive and intermittent glances at his wife, could see with regret, and could understand only too well that she was now inflamed with the passion of a Grand Inquisitor who cannot succeed in stamping out a heresy; and so, in the hope of bringing Swann round to a retractation (for the courage of one's opinions is always a form of calculating cowardice in the eyes of the 'other side'), he broke in:"
"Alors je ne m’occupais plus de cette chose inconnue qui s’enveloppait d’une forme ou d’un parfum, bien tranquille puisque je la ramenais à la maison, protégée par le revêtement d’images sous lesquelles je la trouverais vivante, comme les poissons que, les jours où on m’avait laissé aller à la pêche, je rapportais dans mon panier, couverts par une couche d’herbe qui préservait leur fraîcheur. Une fois à la maison je songeais à autre chose et ainsi s’entassaient dans mon esprit (comme dans ma chambre les fleurs que j’avais cueillies dans mes promenades ou les objets qu’on m’avait donnés), une pierre où jouait un reflet, un toit, un son de cloche, une odeur de feuilles, bien des images différentes sous lesquelles il y a longtemps qu’est morte la réalité pressentie que je n’ai pas eu assez de volonté pour arriver à découvrir. Une fois pourtant – où notre promenade s’étant prolongée fort au delà de sa durée habituelle, nous avions été bien heureux de rencontrer à mi-chemin du retour, comme l’après-midi finissait, le docteur Percepied qui passait en voiture à bride abattue, nous avait reconnus et fait monter avec lui – j’eus une impression de ce genre et ne l’abandonnai pas sans un peu l’approfondir. On m’avait fait monter près du cocher, nous allions comme le vent parce que le docteur avait encore avant de rentrer à Combray à s’arrêter à Martinville-le-Sec chez un malade à la porte duquel il avait été convenu que nous l’attendrions. Au tournant d’un chemin j’éprouvai tout à coup ce plaisir spécial qui ne ressemblait à aucun autre, à apercevoir les deux clochers de Martinville, sur lesquels donnait le soleil couchant et que le mouvement de notre voiture et les lacets du chemin avaient l’air de faire changer de place, puis celui de Vieuxvicq qui, séparé d’eux par une colline et une vallée, et situé sur un plateau plus élevé dans le lointain, semblait pourtant tout voisin d’eux.","So I no longer bothered about this unknown thing which enveloped itself in a form or in a perfume, quite peaceful since I was bringing it home, protected by the covering of images under which I would find it alive, like the fish which, on the days when I had been allowed to go fishing, I brought back in my basket, covered by a layer of grass which preserved their freshness. Once at home I was thinking of something else and so there was a pile in my mind (as in my bedroom of the flowers I had picked during my walks or the objects that had been given to me), a stone on which a reflection, a roof, a sound of a bell, a smell of leaves, many different images under which the sensed reality long ago died that I didn't have enough willpower to manage to discover. Once, however – when our walk had been prolonged well beyond its usual duration, we had been very happy to meet halfway back, as the afternoon was drawing to a close, Doctor Percepied who was passing by in a horse-drawn carriage downcast, had recognized us and brought him up with him – I had such an impression and did not leave him without looking into it a little. I had been put up near the coachman, we were going like the wind because the doctor still had to stop at Martinville-le-Sec before returning to Combray at the door of a patient at whose door it had been agreed that we would go there. would wait. At a bend in a road, I suddenly experienced that special pleasure which was unlike any other, in seeing the two steeples of Martinville, on which the setting sun looked and which the movement of our car and the twists and turns of the road had I seemed to change places, then that of Vieuxvicq which, separated from them by a hill and a valley, and situated on a higher plateau in the distance, nevertheless seemed very close to them.","And so I would stop concerning myself with this unknown thing that was enveloped in a form or a fragrance, feeling quite easy in my mind since I was bringing it back to the house protected by the covering of images under which I would find it alive, like the fish that, on days when I had been allowed to go fishing, I would carry home in my creel covered by a layer of grass that kept them fresh. Once I was back at the house I would think about other things, and so there would accumulate in my mind (as in my room the flowers I had gathered on my walks or objects I had been given) a stone on which a glimmer of light played, a roof, the sound of a bell, a smell of leaves, many different images beneath which the reality I sensed but did not have enough determination to discover had died long before. Once, however—when our walk had extended far beyond its usual duration and we were very happy to encounter halfway home, as the afternoon was ending, Dr. Percepied, who, going past at full speed in his carriage, recognized us and invited us to climb in with him—I had an impression of this kind and did not abandon it without studying it a little. They had had me climb up next to the coachman, we were going like the wind because, before returning to Combray, the doctor still had to stop at Martinville-le-Sec to see a patient at whose door it had been agreed that we would wait for him. At the bend of a road I suddenly experienced that special pleasure which was unlike any other, when I saw the two steeples of Martinville, shining in the setting sun and appearing to change position with the motion of our carriage and the windings of the road, and then the steeple of Vieuxvicq, which, though separated from them by a hill and a valley and situated on a higher plateau in the distance, seemed to be right next to them.","And so I concerned myself no longer with the mystery that lay hidden in a form or a perfume, quite at ease in my mind, since I was taking it home with me, protected by its visible and tangible covering, beneath which I should find it still alive, like the fish which, on days when I had been allowed to go out fishing, I used to carry back in my basket, buried in a couch of grass which kept them cool and fresh. Once in the house again I would begin to think of something else, and so my mind would become littered (as my room was with the flowers that I had gathered on my walks, or the odds and ends that people had given me) with a stone from the surface of which the sunlight was reflected, a roof, the sound of a bell, the smell of fallen leaves, a confused mass of different images, under which must have perished long ago the reality of which I used to have some foreboding, but which I never had the energy to discover and bring to light. Once, however, when we had prolonged our walk far beyond its ordinary limits, and so had been very glad to encounter, half way home, as afternoon darkened into evening, Dr. Percepied, who drove past us at full speed in his carriage, saw and recognised us, stopped, and made us jump in beside him, I received an impression of this sort which I did not abandon without having first subjected it to an examination a little more thorough. I had been set on the box beside the coachman, we were going like the wind because the Doctor had still, before returning to Combray, to call at Martinville-le-Sec, at the house of a patient, at whose door he asked us to wait for him. At a bend in the road I experienced, suddenly, that special pleasure, which bore no resemblance to any other, when I caught sight of the twin steeples of Martinville, on which the setting sun was playing, while the movement of the carriage and the windings of the road seemed to keep them continually changing their position; and then of a third steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, which, although separated from them by a hill and a valley, and rising from rather higher ground in the distance, appeared none the less to be standing by their side."
* * *,* * *,"When on summer evenings the melodious sky growls like a wild animal and everyone grumbles at the storm, it is because of the Méséglise way that I am the only one in ecstasy inhaling, through the noise of the falling rain, the smell of invisible, enduring lilacs.","When, on a summer evening, the resounding sky growls like a tawny lion, and everyone is complaining of the storm, it is along the 'Méséglise way' that my fancy strays alone in ecstasy, inhaling, through the noise of falling rain, the odour of invisible and persistent lilac-trees."
"Mais Swann se disait que s’il montrait à Odette (en consentant seulement à la retrouver après dîner), qu’il y avait des plaisirs qu’il préférait à celui d’être avec elle, le goût qu’elle ressentait pour lui ne connaîtrait pas de longtemps la satiété. Et, d’autre part, préférant infiniment à celle d’Odette la beauté d’une petite ouvrière fraîche et bouffie comme une rose et dont il était épris, il aimait mieux passer le commencement de la soirée avec elle, étant sûr de voir Odette ensuite. C’est pour les mêmes raisons qu’il n’acceptait jamais qu’Odette vînt le chercher pour aller chez les Verdurin. La petite ouvrière l’attendait près de chez lui à un coin de rue que son cocher Rémi connaissait, elle montait à côté de Swann et restait dans ses bras jusqu’au moment où la voiture l’arrêtait devant chez les Verdurin. À son entrée, tandis que MmeVerdurin montrant des roses qu’il avait envoyées le matin lui disait : « Je vous gronde » et lui indiquait une place à côté d’Odette, le pianiste jouait, pour eux deux, la petite phrase de Vinteuil qui était comme l’air national de leur amour. Il commençait par la tenue des trémolos de violon que pendant quelques mesures on entend seuls, occupant tout le premier plan, puis tout d’un coup ils semblaient s’écarter et comme dans ces tableaux de Pieter de Hooch, qu’approfondit le cadre étroit d’une porte entr’ouverte, tout au loin, d’une couleur autre, dans le velouté d’une lumière interposée, la petite phrase apparaissait, dansante, pastorale, intercalée, épisodique, appartenant à un autre monde. Elle passait à plis simples et immortels, distribuant çà et là les dons de sa grâce, avec le même ineffable sourire ; mais Swann y croyait distinguer maintenant du désenchantement. Elle semblait connaître la vanité de ce bonheur dont elle montrait la voie. Dans sa grâce légère, elle avait quelque chose d’accompli, comme le détachement qui succède au regret. Mais peu lui importait, il la considérait moins en elle-même – en ce qu’elle pouvait exprimer pour un musicien qui ignorait l’existence et de lui et d’Odette quand il l’avait composée, et pour tous ceux qui l’entendraient dans des siècles – que comme un gage, un souvenir de son amour qui, même pour les Verdurin ou pour le petit pianiste, faisait penser à Odette en même temps qu’à lui, les unissait ; c’était au point que, comme Odette, par caprice, l’en avait prié, il avait renoncé à son projet de se faire jouer par un artiste la sonate entière, dont il continua à ne connaître que ce passage. « Qu’avez-vous besoin du reste ? lui avait-elle dit. C’est ça notre morceau. » Et même, souffrant de songer, au moment où elle passait si proche et pourtant à l’infini, que tandis qu’elle s’adressait à eux, elle ne les connaissait pas, il regrettait presque qu’elle eût une signification, une beauté intrinsèque et fixe, étrangère à eux, comme en des bijoux donnés, ou même en des lettres écrites par une femme aimée, nous en voulons à l’eau de la gemme et aux mots du langage, de ne pas être faits uniquement de l’essence d’une liaison passagère et d’un être particulier.","But Swann said to himself that if he showed Odette (by simply agreeing to see her after dinner) that there were pleasures he preferred to that of being with her, the taste she felt for him would not would not know satiety for a long time. And, on the other hand, infinitely preferring to Odette's the beauty of a little working girl, fresh and puffy like a rose and with whom he was in love, he preferred to spend the beginning of the evening with her, being sure of seeing Odette. then. It was for the same reasons that he never agreed to Odette coming to fetch him to go to the Verdurins. The little working girl was waiting for him near his home at a corner of the street that his driver Rémi knew, she got in next to Swann and stayed in his arms until the car stopped him in front of the Verdurins. As he entered, while Madame Verdurin showing the roses he had sent in the morning was saying to her: ""I am scolding you"" and showing her a place next to Odette, the pianist played, for both of them, the little phrase from Vinteuil which was like the national air of their love. It began with the sustain of the violin tremolos that for a few bars we hear alone, occupying the entire foreground, then suddenly they seemed to move away and, as in those paintings by Pieter de Hooch, deepened by the narrow frame from a half-open door, far away, in a different color, in the velvetiness of an interposed light, the little phrase appeared, dancing, pastoral, intercalated, episodic, belonging to another world. She passed in simple and immortal folds, distributing here and there the gifts of her grace, with the same ineffable smile; but Swann now thought he saw disenchantment in it. She seemed to know the vanity of this happiness to which she was showing the way. In her light grace, she had something accomplished, like the detachment that follows regret. But it mattered little to him, he considered it less in itself – in what it could express for a musician who was unaware of the existence of both him and Odette when he had composed it, and for all those who would hear centuries from now – that as a token, a memory of his love which, even for the Verdurins or for the little pianist, made Odette think of him at the same time as him, united them; it was to the point that, as Odette, on a whim, had begged him to, he had given up his plan to have an artist play the entire sonata, of which he continued to know only this passage. ""What else do you need?"" she had told him. This is our piece. And even, pained to think, at the moment when she passed so close and yet infinitely, that while she was speaking to them she did not know them, he almost regretted that she had a meaning, a meaning. intrinsic and fixed beauty, foreign to them, as in jewelry given, or even in letters written by a beloved woman, we resent the water of the gem and the words of language, not to be made only of essence of a passing connection and of a particular being.","But Swann said to himself that if he showed Odette (by agreeing only to meet her after dinner) that there were other pleasures he preferred to the pleasure of being with her, a long time would pass before her appetite for him was surfeited. And, too, since he infinitely preferred to Odette’s kind of beauty the beauty of a little working girl as fresh and plump as a rose with whom he was smitten, he chose to spend the beginning of the evening with her, being sure of seeing Odette afterward. It was for the same reasons that he never agreed to have Odette pick him up on her way to the Verdurins’. The little working girl would wait for him near his house at a corner known to his coachman Rémi, she would get in beside Swann and stay there in his arms until the moment the carriage drew up in front of the Verdurins’. When he came in, as Mme. Verdurin, pointing to some roses he had sent that morning, said to him: “You deserve a scolding” and showed him a spot next to Odette, the pianist would play for the two of them the little phrase by Vinteuil that was like the anthem of their love. He would begin with the sustained violin tremolos that are heard alone for a few measures, occupying the entire foreground, then all of a sudden they seemed to move away and, as in those paintings by Pieter de Hooch,22 which assume greater depth because of the narrow frame of a half-open door, away in the distance, in a different color, in the velvet of an interposed light, the little phrase would appear, dancing, pastoral, interpolated, episodic, belonging to another world. It rippled past, simple and immortal, distributing here and there the gifts of its grace, with the same ineffable smile; but Swann thought he could now distinguish within it some disenchantment. It seemed to realize how futile this happiness was to which it showed the way. In its light grace, there was something finished about it, like the detachment that follows regret. But this hardly mattered to him; he considered the phrase less in itself—in what it could express to a musician who was unaware of his existence or of Odette’s when he composed it, and to all those who would hear it in the centuries to come—than as a token, a memory of his love which, even for the Verdurins, even for the young pianist, would remind them of Odette and him at the same time, would join them together; so much so that when Odette, capriciously, had begged him to, he had given up the idea of having some pianist play him the entire sonata, of which he knew as yet only this passage. “Why would you need the rest?” she said to him. “This is our piece.” And in fact, pained by the thought that, at the moment when it passed so close and yet infinitely far away, though it was addressed to them it did not know them, he was almost sorry it had any meaning, any intrinsic and unalterable beauty, alien to them, just as in the jewels given to us, or even the letters written to us by a woman we love, we resent the water of the gem and the words of the language, because they are not created exclusively from the essence of a passing love affair and a particular person.","But Swann said to himself that, if he could make Odette feel (by consenting to meet her only after dinner) that there were other pleasures which he preferred to that of her company, then the desire that she felt for his would be all the longer in reaching the point of satiety. Besides, as he infinitely preferred to Odette's style of beauty that of a little working girl, as fresh and plump as a rose, with whom he happened to be simultaneously in love, he preferred to spend the first part of the evening with her, knowing that he was sure to see Odette later on. For the same reason, he would never allow Odette to call for him at his house, to take him on to the Verdurins'. The little girl used to wait, not far from his door, at a street corner; Rémi, his coachman, knew where to stop; she would jump in beside him, and hold him in her arms until the carriage drew up at the Verdurins'. He would enter the drawing-room; and there, while Mme. Verdurin, pointing to the roses which he had sent her that morning, said: ""I am furious with you!"" and sent him to the place kept for him, by the side of Odette, the pianist would play to them—for their two selves, and for no one else—that little phrase by Vinteuil which was, so to speak, the national anthem of their love. He began, always, with a sustained tremolo from the violin part, which, for several bars, was unaccompanied, and filled all the foreground; until suddenly it seemed to be drawn aside, and—just as in those interiors by Pieter de Hooch, where the subject is set back a long way through the narrow framework of a half-opened door—infinitely remote, in colour quite different, velvety with the radiance of some intervening light, the little phrase appeared, dancing, pastoral, interpolated, episodic, belonging to another world. It passed, with simple and immortal movements, scattering on every side the bounties of its grace, smiling ineffably still; but Swann thought that he could now discern in it some disenchantment. It seemed to be aware how vain, how hollow was the happiness to which it shewed the way. In its airy grace there was, indeed, something definitely achieved, and complete in itself, like the mood of philosophic detachment which follows an outburst of vain regret. But little did that matter to him; he looked upon the sonata less in its own light—as what it might express, had, in fact, expressed to a certain musician, ignorant that any Swann or Odette, anywhere in the world, existed, when he composed it, and would express to all those who should hear it played in centuries to come—than as a pledge, a token of his love, which made even the Verdurins and their little pianist think of Odette and, at the same time, of himself—which bound her to him by a lasting tie; and at that point he had (whimsically entreated by Odette) abandoned the idea of getting some 'professional' to play over to him the whole sonata, of which he still knew no more than this one passage. ""Why do you want the rest? "" she had asked him. ""Our little bit; that's all we need."" He went farther; agonised by the reflection, at the moment when it passed by him, so near and yet so infinitely remote, that, while it was addressed to their ears, it knew them not, he would regret, almost, that it had a meaning of its own, an intrinsic and unalterable beauty, foreign to themselves, just as in the jewels given to us, or even in the letters written to us by a woman with whom we are in love, we find fault with the 'water' of a stone, or with the words of a sentence because they are not fashioned exclusively from the spirit of a fleeting intimacy and of a 'lass unparalleled.'"
"sur la lettre où il avait lu : « Ma main tremble si fort en vous écrivant » – le rapprochement de ses sourcils quand elle lui avait dit d’un air suppliant : « Ce n’est pas dans trop longtemps que vous me ferez signe ? » ; il sentit l’odeur du fer du coiffeur par lequel il se faisait relever sa « brosse » pendant que Lorédan allait chercher la petite ouvrière, les pluies d’orage qui tombèrent si souvent ce printemps-là, le retour glacial dans sa victoria, au clair de lune, toutes les mailles d’habitudes mentales, d’impressions saisonnières, de créations cutanées, qui avaient étendu sur une suite de semaines un réseau uniforme dans lequel son corps se trouvait repris. À ce moment-là, il satisfaisait une curiosité voluptueuse en connaissant les plaisirs des gens qui vivent par l’amour. Il avait cru qu’il pourrait s’en tenir là, qu’il ne serait pas obligé d’en apprendre les douleurs ; comme maintenant le charme d’Odette lui était peu de chose auprès de cette formidable terreur qui le prolongeait comme un trouble halo, cette immense angoisse de ne pas savoir à tous moments ce qu’elle avait fait, de ne pas la posséder partout et toujours ! Hélas, il se rappela l’accent dont elle s’était écriée : « Mais je pourrai toujours vous voir, je suis toujours libre ! » elle qui ne l’était plus jamais ! l’intérêt, la curiosité qu’elle avait eus pour sa vie à lui, le désir passionné qu’il lui fît la faveur – redoutée au contraire par lui en ce temps-là comme une cause d’ennuyeux dérangements – de l’y laisser pénétrer ; comme elle avait été obligée de le prier pour qu’il se laissât mener chez les Verdurin ; et, quand il la faisait venir chez lui une fois par mois, comme il avait fallu, avant qu’il se laissât fléchir, qu’elle lui répétât le délice que serait cette habitude de se voir tous les jours dont elle rêvait alors qu’elle ne lui semblait à lui qu’un fastidieux tracas, puis qu’elle avait prise en dégoût et définitivement rompue, pendant qu’elle était devenue pour lui un si invincible et si douloureux besoin. Il ne savait pas dire si vrai quand, à la troisième fois qu’il l’avait vue, comme elle lui répétait : « Mais pourquoi ne me laissez-vous pas venir plus souvent », il lui avait dit en riant, avec galanterie : « par peur de souffrir ». Maintenant, hélas ! il arrivait encore parfois qu’elle lui écrivît d’un restaurant ou d’un hôtel sur du papier qui en portait le nom imprimé ; mais c’était comme des lettres de feu qui le brûlaient. « C’est écrit de l’hôtel Vouillemont ? Qu’y peut-elle être allée faire ! avec qui ? que s’y est-il passé ? » Il se rappela les becs de gaz qu’on éteignait boulevard des Italiens quand il l’avait rencontrée contre tout espoir parmi les ombres errantes, dans cette nuit qui lui avait semblé presque surnaturelle et qui en effet – nuit d’un temps où il n’avait même pas à se demander s’il ne la contrarierait pas en la cherchant, en la retrouvant, tant il était sûr qu’elle n’avait pas de plus grande joie que de le voir et de rentrer avec lui – appartenait bien à un monde mystérieux où on ne peut jamais revenir quand les portes s’en sont refermées. Et Swann aperçut, immobile en face de ce bonheur revécu, un malheureux qui lui fit pitié parce qu’il ne le reconnut pas tout de suite, si bien qu’il dut baisser les yeux pour qu’on ne vît pas qu’ils étaient pleins de larmes.","on the letter where he had read: “My hand is shaking so much while writing to you” – the closeness of her eyebrows when she had said pleadingly to him: “Won’t you be calling me for too long? » ; he smelled the odor of the hairdresser's iron with which he had his ""brush"" raised while Lorédan went to fetch the little worker, the stormy rains which fell so often that spring, the icy return to his victoria, to the moonlight, all the meshes of mental habits, of seasonal impressions, of cutaneous creations, which had extended over a series of weeks a uniform network in which his body found itself caught up. At that time, he was satisfying a voluptuous curiosity by knowing the pleasures of people who live by love. He had believed that he could stop there, that he would not be obliged to learn the pains of it; as now Odette's charm was little to him compared to this formidable terror which prolonged it like a troubled halo, this immense anguish of not knowing at all times what she had done, of not possessing her everywhere and always. ! Alas, he remembered the tone in which she had exclaimed: ""But I can always see you, I am always free!"" “She who was never again! the interest, the curiosity she had had for his life, the passionate desire that he would do her the favor - on the contrary, dreaded by him at that time as a cause for bothersome disturbances - let in; as she had been obliged to beg him to allow himself to be taken to the Verdurins; and, when he made her come to his house once a month, as he had had to, before he allowed himself to relent, that she repeated to him the delight that would be this habit of seeing each other every day of which she dreamed when she seemed to him only a tedious hassle, then one that she had taken in disgust and finally broken with, while she had become such an invincible and painful need for him. He did not know how to tell the truth when, the third time he had seen her, as she repeated to him: ""But why don't you let me come more often"", he had said to her, laughing, with gallantry: “for fear of suffering”. Now, alas! it still sometimes happened that she wrote to him from a restaurant or a hotel on paper which bore the name printed on it; but it was like letters of fire burning him. “Is it written from the Hotel Vouillemont? What could she have been doing! with whom ? what happened there? He remembered the gaslights that were being turned off on the Boulevard des Italiens when he had met her against all did not even have to wonder if he would not upset her by looking for her, by finding her, so sure was he that she had no greater joy than to see him and to return with him - belonged well to a mysterious world where you can never return when the doors have closed. And Swann saw, motionless in the face of this relived happiness, an unfortunate man who made him pity because he did not recognize him right away, so much so that he had to lower his eyes so that no one could see that they were full of tears.","In place of the abstract expressions the time when I was happy, the time when I was loved, which he had often used before now without suffering too much, for his mind had enclosed within them only spurious extracts of the past that preserved nothing of it, he now recovered everything which had fixed forever the specific, volatile essence of that lost happiness; he saw everything again, the snowy curled petals of the chrysanthemum that she had tossed to him in his carriage, that he had held against his lips—the embossed address of the “Maison Dorée” on the letter in which he had read: “My hand is shaking so badly as I write to you”—the way her eyebrows had come together when she said to him with a supplicating look: “It won’t be too long before you send word to me?”; he smelled the fragrance of the hairdresser’s iron by which he would have his “brush cut” straightened while Lorédan went to fetch the young working girl, the stormy rains that fell so often that spring, the icy drive home in his victoria, by moonlight, all the meshes formed from habits of thinking, impressions of the seasons, reactions on the surface of his skin, which had laid over a succession of weeks a uniform net in which his body was now recaptured. At that time, he was satisfying a sensual curiosity by experiencing the pleasures of people who live for love. He had believed he could stop there, that he would not be obliged to learn their sorrows; how small a thing Odette’s charm was for him now compared with the astounding terror that extended out from it like a murky halo, the immense anguish of not knowing at every moment what she had been doing, of not possessing her everywhere and always! Alas, he recalled the accents in which she had exclaimed: “But I will always be able to see you, I am always free!”—she who was never free now!—the interest, the curiosity she had shown in his own life, the passionate desire that he should do her the favor—which he in fact dreaded in those days as a cause of tiresome inconveniences—of allowing her to enter it; how she had been obliged to beg him to let her take him to the Verdurins’; and when he had allowed her to come to him once a month, how she had had to tell him over and over again, before he would let himself give in to her, how delightful it would be to have the habit of seeing each other every day, a habit which she dreamed of whereas to him it seemed only a tedious bother, which she had then grown tired of and broken once and for all, while for him it had become such an irresistible and painful need. He did not know how truthfully he was speaking when, the third time he saw her, as she said to him yet again: “But why don’t you let me come more often?” he had said to her with a laugh, gallantly: “for fear of being hurt.” Now, alas, she still wrote to him occasionally from a restaurant or hotel on paper that bore its printed name; but now the letters of that name burned him like letters of fire. “It’s written from the Hôtel Vouillemont?105 What can she have gone there to do? And with whom? What has been going on there?” He remembered the gas jets being extinguished along the boulevard des Italiens when he had met her against all hope among the wandering shades on that night which had seemed to him almost supernatural and which indeed—since it belonged to a time when he did not even have to ask himself if he would vex her by looking for her, by finding her, so sure was he that her greatest joy was to see him and go home with him—was truly part of a mysterious world to which one can never return once its doors have closed. And Swann saw, motionless before that relived happiness, a miserable figure who filled him with pity because he did not recognize him right away, and he had to lower his eyes so that no one would see that they were full of tears.","You won't let it be very long before you send for me?""; he could smell the heated iron of the barber whom he used to have in to singe his hair while Loredan went to fetch the little working girl; could feel the torrents of rain which fell so often that spring, the ice-cold homeward drive in his victoria, by moonlight; all the network of mental habits, of seasonable impressions, of sensory reactions, which had extended over a series of weeks its uniform meshes, by which his body now found itself inextricably held. At that time he had been satisfying a sensual curiosity to know what were the pleasures of those people who lived for love alone. He had supposed that he could stop there, that he would not be obliged to learn their sorrows also; how small a thing the actual charm of Odette was now in comparison with that formidable terror which extended it like a cloudy halo all around her, that enormous anguish of not knowing at every hour of the day and night what she had been doing, of not possessing her wholly, at all times and in all places! Alas, he recalled the accents in which she had exclaimed: ""But I can see you at any time; I am always free!""—she, who was never free now; the interest, the curiosity that she had shewn in his life, her passionate desire that he should do her the favour—of which it was he who, then, had felt suspicious, as of a possibly tedious waste of his time and disturbance of his arrangements—of granting her access to his study; how she had been obliged to beg that he would let her take him to the Verdurins'; and, when he did allow her to come to him once a month, how she had first, before he would let himself be swayed, had to repeat what a joy it would be to her, that custom of their seeing each other daily, for which she had longed at a time when to him it had seemed only a tiresome distraction, for which, since that time, she had conceived a distaste and had definitely broken herself of it, while it had become for him so insatiable, so dolorous a need. Little had he suspected how truly he spoke when, on their third meeting, as she repeated: ""But why don't you let me come to you oftener?"" he had told her, laughing, and in a vein of gallantry, that it was for fear of forming a hopeless passion. Now, alas, it still happened at times that she wrote to him from a restaurant or hotel, on paper which bore a printed address, but printed in letters of fire that seared his heart. "" Written from the Hôtel Vouillemont. What on earth can she have gone there for? With whom? What happened there?"" He remembered the gas-jets that were being extinguished along the Boulevard des Italiens when he had met her, when all hope was gone among the errant shades upon that night which had seemed to him almost supernatural and which now (that night of a period when he had not even to ask himself whether he would be annoying her by looking for her and by finding her, so certain was he that she knew no greater happiness than to see him and to let him take her home) belonged indeed to a mysterious world to which one never may return again once its doors are closed. And Swann could distinguish, standing, motionless, before that scene of happiness in which it lived again, a wretched figure which filled him with such pity, because he did not at first recognise who it was, that he must lower his head, lest anyone should observe that his eyes were filled with tears."

"Mais c’est abominable, tout simplement. Et vous osez citer cela ? » Et mon grand-père navré, sentant l’impossibilité, devant cette obstruction, de chercher à faire raconter à Swann les histoires qui l’eussent amusé, disait à voix basse à maman : « Rappelle-moi donc le vers que tu m’as appris et qui me soulage tant dans ces moments-là. Ah !","But it's just awful. And you dare to quote that?

Ah!","Why, it’s quite abominable. And you dare to quote that?” And my grandfather, terribly upset and sensing how impossible it would be, in the face of this obstruction, to try to get Swann to tell the stories that would have amused him, said quietly to Mama: “Now remind me of the line you taught me that comforts me so much at times like this. Oh, yes! ‘","Really and truly, it's abominable. And you dare to quote it!"" And my grandfather, utterly depressed, realising how futile it would be for him, against this opposition, to attempt to get Swann to tell him the stories which would have amused him, murmured to my mother: ""Just tell me again that line of yours which always comforts me so much on these occasions.

"Mais quand j’arrivais aux Champs-Élysées – et que d’abord j’allais pouvoir confronter mon amour, pour lui faire subir les rectifications nécessaires, à sa cause vivante, indépendante de moi – dès que j’étais en présence de cette Gilberte Swann sur la vue de laquelle j’avais compté pour rafraîchir les images que ma mémoire fatiguée ne retrouvait plus, de cette Gilberte Swann avec qui j’avais joué hier, et que venait de me faire saluer et reconnaître un instinct aveugle comme celui qui dans la marche nous met un pied devant l’autre avant que nous ayons eu le temps de penser, aussitôt tout se passait comme si elle et la fillette qui était l’objet de mes rêves avaient été deux êtres différents. Par exemple si depuis la veille je portais dans ma mémoire deux yeux de feu dans des joues pleines et brillantes, la figure de Gilberte m’offrait maintenant avec insistance quelque chose que précisément je ne m’étais pas rappelé, un certain effilement aigu du nez qui, s’associant instantanément à d’autres traits, prenait l’importance de ces caractères qui en histoire naturelle définissent une espèce, et la transmuait en une fillette du genre de celles à museau pointu. Tandis que je m’apprêtais à profiter de cet instant désiré pour me livrer, sur l’image de Gilberte que j’avais préparée avant de venir et que je ne retrouvais plus dans ma tête, à la mise au point qui me permettrait dans les longues heures où j’étais seul d’être sûr que c’était bien elle que je me rappelais, que c’était bien mon amour pour elle que j’accroissais peu à peu comme un ouvrage qu’on compose, elle me passait une balle ; et comme le philosophe idéaliste dont le corps tient compte du monde extérieur à la réalité duquel son intelligence ne croit pas, le même moi qui m’avait fait la saluer avant que je l’eusse identifiée, s’empressait de me faire saisir la balle qu’elle me tendait (comme si elle était une camarade avec qui j’étais venu jouer, et non une âme sœur que j’étais venu rejoindre), me faisait lui tenir par bienséance jusqu’à l’heure où elle s’en allait, mille propos, aimables et insignifiants et m’empêchait ainsi, ou de garder le silence pendant lequel j’aurais pu enfin remettre la main sur l’image urgente et égarée, ou de lui dire les paroles qui pouvaient faire faire à notre amour les progrès décisifs sur lesquels j’étais chaque fois obligé de ne plus compter que pour l’après-midi suivante. Il en faisait pourtant quelques-uns. Un jour que nous étions allés avec Gilberte jusqu’à la baraque de notre marchande qui était particulièrement aimable pour nous – car c’était chez elle que M. Swann faisait acheter son pain d’épices, et par hygiène, il en consommait beaucoup, souffrant d’un eczéma ethnique et de la constipation des Prophètes – Gilberte me montrait en riant deux petits garçons qui étaient comme le petit coloriste et le petit naturaliste des livres d’enfants. Car l’un ne voulait pas d’un sucre d’orge rouge parce qu’il préférait le violet et l’autre, les larmes aux yeux, refusait une prune que voulait lui acheter sa bonne, parce que, finit-il par dire d’une voix passionnée : « J’aime mieux l’autre prune, parce qu’elle a un ver ! » J’achetai deux billes d’un sou. Je regardais avec admiration, lumineuses et captives dans une sébile isolée, les billes d’agate qui me semblaient précieuses parce qu’elles étaient souriantes et blondes comme des jeunes filles et parce qu’elles coûtaient cinquante centimes pièce. Gilberte, à qui on donnait beaucoup plus d’argent qu’à moi, me demanda laquelle je trouvais la plus belle. Elles avaient la transparence et le fondu de la vie. Je n’aurais voulu lui en faire sacrifier aucune. J’aurais aimé qu’elle pût les acheter, les délivrer toutes. Pourtant je lui en désignai une qui avait la couleur de ses yeux. Gilberte la prit, chercha son rayon doré, la caressa, paya sa rançon, mais aussitôt me remit sa captive en me disant : « Tenez, elle est à vous, je vous la donne, gardez-la comme souvenir. »","But when I arrived at the Champs-Élysées – and when I was first going to be able to confront my love, to make it undergo the necessary rectifications, with its living cause, independent of me – as soon as I was in the presence of this Gilberte Swann on whose sight I had counted to refresh the images that my tired memory no longer found, of this Gilberte Swann with whom I had played yesterday, and whom I had just made me salute and recognize a blind instinct like the one which in walking puts us one foot in front of the other before we had time to think, immediately everything happened as if she and the little girl who was the object of my dreams had been two different beings. For example, if since the day before I had carried in my memory two fiery eyes in full, shining cheeks, Gilberte's face now offered me insistently something that I had not precisely remembered, a certain sharp tapering of the nose. which, associating itself instantaneously with other traits, took on the importance of those characters which in natural history define a species, and transmuted it into a little girl of the kind of those with pointed snouts. While I was about to take advantage of this desired moment to deliver myself, on the image of Gilberte that I had prepared before coming and that I could no longer find in my head, to the development that would allow me in the long hours when I was alone to be sure that it was indeed her that I remembered, that it was indeed my love for her that I grew little by little like a work that one composes, she gave me a ball ; and like the idealistic philosopher whose body takes account of the external world whose reality his intelligence does not believe, the same me who had made me greet her before I had identified her, hastened to make me seize the ball that she held out to me (as if she were a friend with whom I had come to play, and not a soul mate whom I had come to join), made me hold her to her out of decorum until the hour when she left was going, a thousand words, kind and insignificant and thus prevented me, either from keeping silence during which I could finally have put my hand back on the urgent and lost image, or from saying to him the words that could make our love do the decisive progress on which I was each time obliged to count only for the following afternoon. He did, however, a few. One day when we had gone with Gilberte to the barracks of our merchant who was particularly kind to us - because it was at her place that Mr. Swann had his gingerbread bought, and for hygiene he ate a lot of it, suffering from ethnic eczema and the constipation of the Prophets – Gilberte laughingly showed me two little boys who were like the little colorist and the little naturalist in children's books. Because one didn't want a red candy cane because he preferred purple and the other, with tears in his eyes, refused a plum that his maid wanted to buy him, because, he ended up saying in an impassioned voice: ""I like the other plum better, because it has a worm!"" I bought two penny balls. I gazed with admiration, luminous and captive in an isolated bowl, at the agate balls which seemed precious to me because they were smiling and blond like young girls and because they cost fifty centimes each. Gilberte, to whom much more money was given than to me, asked me which one I thought was the prettiest. They had the transparency and fade of life. I would not have wanted to make him sacrifice any of them. I wish she could buy them, deliver them all. However, I pointed out one that had the color of his eyes. Gilberte took her, looked for her golden ray, caressed her, paid her ransom, but immediately handed her captive over to me, saying: ""Here, she is yours, I give her to you, keep her as a souvenir."" »","But when I reached the Champs-Élysées—and when, before anything else, I would be able to confront my love, so as to subject it to the necessary corrections, with its living cause, independent of me—as soon as I was in the presence of that Gilberte Swann on the sight of whom I had counted to refresh the images that my tired memory could no longer recapture, of that Gilberte Swann with whom I had played yesterday, and whom I had just been moved to greet and recognize by a blind instinct like that which, when we are walking, sets one of our feet in front of the other before we have had time to think, immediately it was as if she and the little girl who was the object of my dreams had been two different creatures. For example if, since the day before, I had been carrying in my memory two blazing eyes in full and shining cheeks, Gilberte’s face now presented me insistently with something that quite specifically I had not recalled, a certain sharp tapering of the nose, which, instantaneously associating itself with certain other features, assumed the importance of those characteristics which in natural history define a whole species, and transmuted her into a little girl of the type that have pointed snouts. While I was preparing to take advantage of this longed-for moment in order to devote myself to submitting the image of Gilberte which I had prepared before coming, and which I could no longer find again in my mind, to an amendment that would allow me, in the long hours when I was alone, to be sure it was truly she whom I was recalling, that it was truly my love for her that I was augmenting little by little like a book as it is being written, she would pass me a ball; and, like the idealist philosopher whose body makes allowances for the external world in the reality of which his intelligence does not believe, the same self who had made me greet her before I identified her, hastened to make me take the ball she was holding out to me (as if she were a friend with whom I had come here to play, and not a sister soul with whom I had come to be united), made me exchange with her, for the sake of decorum, until the hour when she went off, a thousand friendly and meaningless remarks and thus kept me both from preserving a silence during which I could at last have laid hands once more on the urgent truant image and from uttering the words that might have brought about the decisive progress in our love, the hope of which I was obliged each time to postpone until the following afternoon. It did, however, make some progress. One day when we had gone off with Gilberte to the booth of the vendor who was particularly nice to us—for it was to her that M. Swann sent for his spice cake,19 and for health reasons, he consumed a great deal of it, suffering from ethnic eczema and the Prophets’ constipation— Gilberte showed me with a smile two little boys who were like the little artist and the little naturalist in children’s storybooks. For one of them did not want a stick of red barley sugar because he preferred violet, and the other, tears in his eyes, was refusing the plum his nanny wanted to buy for him because, he finally said with passion: “ I like the other plum better, because it has a worm!” I bought two one-sou marbles. I gazed with admiration at the agates, luminous and captive in their separate wooden bowl, precious in my eyes because they were as blond and beaming as young girls and because they cost fifty centimes apiece. Gilberte, who was given a great deal more money than I was, asked me which I thought was the most beautiful. They had the molten transparency of life itself. I did not want to make her sacrifice a single one of them. I would have liked her to be able to buy them, liberate them, all. Yet I pointed to one which was the same color as her eyes. Gilberte took it, looked for its golden ray of light, stroked it, paid its ransom, but immediately handed her captive over to me saying: “Here, it’s for you, I’m giving it to you, keep it as a souvenir.”","But when I arrived at the Champs-Elysées,—and, as at first sight it appeared, was in a position to confront my love, so as to make it undergo the necessary modifications, with its living and independent cause—as soon as I was in the presence of that Gilberte Swann on the sight of whom I had counted to revive the images that my tired memory had lost and could not find again, of that Gilberte Swann with whom I had been playing the day before, and whom I had just been prompted to greet, and then to recognise, by a blind instinct like that which, when we are walking, sets one foot before the other, without giving us time to think what we are doing, then at once it became as though she and the little girl who had inspired my dreams had been two different people. If, for instance, I had retained in my memory overnight two fiery eyes above plump and rosy cheeks, Gilberte's face would now offer me (and with emphasis) something that I distinctly had not remembered, a certain sharpening and prolongation of the nose which, instantaneously associating itself with certain others of her features, assumed the importance of those characteristics which, in natural history, are used to define a species, and transformed her into a little girl of the kind that have sharpened profiles. While I was making myself ready to take advantage of this long expected moment, and to surrender myself to the impression of Gilberte which I had prepared beforehand but could no longer find in my head, to an extent which would enable me, during the long hours which I must spend alone, to be certain that it was indeed herself whom I had in mind, that it was indeed my love for her that I was gradually making grow, as a book grows when one is writing it , she threw me a ball; and, like the idealist philosopher whose body takes account of the external world in the reality of which his intellect declines to believe, the same self which had made me salute her before I had identified her now urged me to catch the ball that she tossed to me (as though she had been a companion, with whom I had come to play, and not a sister-soul with whom my soul had come to be limited), made me, out of politeness, until the time came when she had to I go, address a thousand polite and trivial remarks to her, and so prevented me both from keeping a silence in which I might at last have laid my hand upon the indispensable, escaped idea, and from uttering the words which might have made that definite progress in the course of our love on which I was always obliged to count only for the following afternoon. There was, however, an occasional development. One day, we had gone with Gilberte to the stall of our own special vendor, who was always particularly nice to us, since it was to her that M. Swann used to send for his gingerbread, of which, for reasons of health (he suffered from a racial eczema, and from the constipation of the prophets), he consumed a great quantity,—Gilberte pointed out to me with a laugh two little boys who were like the little artist and the little naturalist in the children's storybooks. For one of them would not have a red stick of rock because he preferred the purple, while the other, with tears in his eyes, refused a plum which his nurse was buying for him, because, as he finally explained in passionate tones: ""I want the other plum; it's got a worm in it!"" I purchased two ha'penny marbles. With admiring eyes I saw, luminous and imprisoned in a bowl by themselves, the agate marbles which seemed precious to me because they were as fair and smiling as little girls, and because they cost five-pence each. Gilberte, who was given a great deal more pocket money than I ever had, asked me which I thought the prettiest. They were as transparent, as liquid-seeming as life itself. I would not have had her sacrifice a single one of them. I should have liked her to be able to buy them, to liberate them all. Still, I pointed out one that had the same colour as her eyes. Gilberte took it, turned it about until it shone with a ray of gold, fondled it, paid its ransom, but at once handed me her captive, saying: ""Take it; it is for you, I give it to you, keep it to remind yourself of me."""
"Quand après la messe, on entrait dire à Théodore d’apporter une brioche plus grosse que d’habitude parce que nos cousins avaient profité du beau temps pour venir de Thiberzy déjeuner avec nous, on avait devant soi le clocher qui, doré et cuit lui-même comme une plus grande brioche bénie, avec des écailles et des égouttements gommeux de soleil, piquait sa pointe aiguë dans le ciel bleu. Et le soir, quand je rentrais de promenade et pensais au moment où il faudrait tout à l’heure dire bonsoir à ma mère et ne plus la voir, il était au contraire si doux, dans la journée finissante, qu’il avait l’air d’être posé et enfoncé comme un coussin de velours brun sur le ciel pâli qui avait cédé sous sa pression, s’était creusé légèrement pour lui faire sa place et refluait sur ses bords ; et les cris des oiseaux qui tournaient autour de lui semblaient accroître son silence, élancer encore sa flèche et lui donner quelque chose d’ineffable.","When, after mass, we went in to tell Theodore to bring a bigger brioche than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the fine weather to come from Thiberzy to have lunch with us, we had in front of us the steeple which, gilded and baked -even like a blessed larger bun, with scales and gummy drips of sunshine, poked its sharp point into the blue sky. And in the evening, when I came back from a walk and thought about the moment when I would have to say good evening to my mother and not see her again, he was on the contrary so gentle, at the end of the day, that he had the the air of being posed and sunk like a cushion of brown velvet on the pale sky which had yielded under its pressure, had hollowed itself out slightly to make room for it and was flowing back to its edges; and the cries of the birds which circled around him seemed to increase his silence, to shoot his arrow still further, and to give him something ineffable.","When after Mass we went in to ask Théodore to bring us a brioche larger than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the fine weather to come from Thiberzy to have lunch with us, we would have the steeple there in front of us, itself golden and baked like a greater blessed brioche, with flakes and gummy drippings of sun, pricking its sharp point into the blue sky. And in the evening, when I was coming home from a walk and thinking about the moment when I would soon have to say goodnight to my mother and not see her anymore, it was on the contrary so soft, at the close of day, that it looked as if it had been set down and crushed like a cushion of brown velvet against the pale sky which had yielded under its pressure, hollowing slightly to give it room and flowing back over its edges; and the cries of the birds that wheeled around it seemed to increase its silence, lift its spire to a greater height, and endow it with something ineffable.","And again, after mass, when we looked in to tell Théodore to bring a larger loaf than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the fine weather to come over from Thiberzy for luncheon, we had in front of us the steeple, which, baked and brown itself like a larger loaf still of 'holy bread,' with flakes and sticky drops on it of sunlight, pricked its sharp point into the blue sky. And in the evening, as I came in from my walk and thought of the approaching moment when I must say good night to my mother and see her no more, the steeple was by contrast so kindly , there at the close of day, that I would imagine it as being laid, like a brown velvet cushion, against—as being thrust into the pallid sky which had yielded beneath its pressure, had sunk slightly so as to make room for it, and had correspondingly risen on either side; while the cries of the birds wheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence, to elongate its spire still further, and to invest it with some quality beyond the power of words."
"Le nom de Beuzeval l’avait fait penser à celui d’une autre localité de cette région, Beuzeville, qui porte uni à celui-là par un trait d’union un autre nom, celui de Bréauté, qu’il avait vu souvent sur les cartes, mais dont pour la première fois il remarquait que c’était le même que celui de son ami M. de Bréauté, dont la lettre anonyme disait qu’il avait été l’amant d’Odette.","The name of Beuzeval had made him think of that of another locality in this region, Beuzeville, which bears united to that one by a hyphen another name, that of Bréauté, which he had often seen on the cards, but which for the first time he noticed was the same as that of his friend M. de Bréauté, whose anonymous letter said he had been Odette's lover.","The name Beuzeval had reminded him of the name of another place in the same area, Beuzeville, whose name is joined by a hyphen to another, Bréauté, which he had often seen on maps, but without ever noticing before that it was the same as that of his friend M. de Bréauté, whom the anonymous letter mentioned as having been Odette’s lover.","The name of Beuzeval had suggested to him that of another place in the same district, Beuzeville, which carried also, bound to it by a hyphen, a second name, to wit Bréauté, which he had often seen on maps, but without ever previously remarking that it was the same name as that borne by his friend M. de Bréauté, whom the anonymous letter accused of having been Odette's lover."
"Parfois c’était après quelques jours où elle ne lui avait pas causé de souci nouveau ; et comme, des visites prochaines qu’il lui ferait, il savait qu’il ne pouvait tirer nulle bien grande joie, mais plus probablement quelque chagrin qui mettrait fin au calme où il se trouvait, il lui écrivait qu’étant très occupé il ne pourrait la voir aucun des jours qu’il lui avait dit.","Sometimes it was after a few days when she had caused him no new concern; and as, from the forthcoming visits he would make to her, he knew that he could derive no very great joy, but more probably some sorrow which would put an end to the calm in which he was, he wrote to her that being very busy he would not could see her any of the days he had told her.","Sometimes this was after several days during which she had not given him any new reason to worry; and since, from the next few visits he would make to her, he knew he would not derive any very great joy but more probably some vexation that would put an end to his present state of calm , he would write to her that since he was very busy he would not be able to see her on any of the days on which he had said he would.","Sometimes several days had elapsed, during which she had caused him no fresh anxiety; and as, from the next few visits which he would pay her, he knew that he was likely to derive not any great pleasure, but, more probably, some annoyance which would put an end to the state of calm in which he found himself, he wrote to her that he was very busy, and would not be able to see her on any of the days that he had suggested."
"Quelques mois après, si mon grand-père demandait au nouvel ami de Swann : « Et Swann, le voyez-vous toujours beaucoup ? » la figure de l’interlocuteur s’allongeait : « Ne prononcez jamais son nom devant moi ! » – « Mais je croyais que vous étiez si liés… » Il avait été ainsi pendant quelques mois le familier de cousins de ma grand’mère, dînant presque chaque jour chez eux. Brusquement il cessa de venir, sans avoir prévenu. On le crut malade, et la cousine de ma grand’mère allait envoyer demander de ses nouvelles, quand à l’office elle trouva une lettre de lui qui traînait par mégarde dans le livre de comptes de la cuisinière. Il y annonçait à cette femme qu’il allait quitter Paris, qu’il ne pourrait plus venir. Elle était sa maîtresse, et au moment de rompre, c’était elle seule qu’il avait jugé utile d’avertir.","A few months later, if my grandfather asked Swann's new friend: ""And Swann, do you still see him a lot?"" the face of the interlocutor lengthened: “Never pronounce his name in front of me! – “But I thought you were so close…” He had been thus for several months the familiar of my grandmother’s cousins, dining almost every day with them. Suddenly he stopped coming, without warning. They thought he was ill, and my grandmother's cousin was going to send for news of him, when in the pantry she found a letter from him which was inadvertently lying around in the cook's account book. He announced to this woman that he was going to leave Paris, that he could no longer come. She was his mistress, and when it came time to break up, it was she alone he had seen fit to warn.","A few months later, if my grandfather asked Swann’s new friend: “And Swann—do you still see as much of him as ever?” the face of the man he was talking to would grow long: “Never mention his name to me again!” “But I thought you were so close . . .” For several months he had, for instance, been intimate friends with cousins of my grandmother, dining almost every day at their house. Suddenly, and without letting them know, he stopped coming. They thought he was ill, and my grandmother’s cousin was about to send word asking for news of him, when in the pantry she found a letter from him left inadvertently in the cook’s account book. In it he told the woman he was leaving Paris, that he would not be able to continue seeing her. She was his mistress, and when he broke it off with her, she was the only one he thought he needed to tell.","A few months later, if my grandfather asked Swann's new friend ""What about Swann? Do you still see as much of him as ever? "" the other's face would lengthen: ""Never mention his name to me again!"" ""But I thought that you were such friends..."" He had been intimate in this way for several months with some cousins of my grandmother, dining almost every evening at their house. Suddenly, and without any warning, he ceased to appear. They supposed him to be ill, and the lady of the house was going to send to inquire for him when, in her kitchen, she found a letter in his hand, which her cook had left by accident in the housekeeping book. In this he announced that he was leaving Paris and would not be able to come to the house again. The cook had been his mistress, and at the moment of breaking off relations she was the only one of the household whom he had thought it necessary to inform."
"Mais aussitôt sa jalousie, comme si elle était l’ombre de son amour, se complétait du double de ce nouveau sourire qu’elle lui avait adressé le soir même – et qui, inverse maintenant, raillait Swann et se chargeait d’amour pour un autre – de cette inclinaison de sa tête mais renversée vers d’autres lèvres, et, données à un autre, toutes les marques de tendresse qu’elle avait eues pour lui.","But immediately her jealousy, as if she were the shadow of his love, was completed by the double of that new smile which she had addressed to him that very evening – and which, in reverse now, mocked Swann and was charged with love for a another – of this inclination of her head but tilted towards other lips, and, given to another, all the marks of tenderness that she had had for him.","But instantly his jealousy, as if it were the shadow of his love, would furnish itself with a duplicate of the new smile she had given him that very evening—and which, inverse now, mocked Swann and was filled with love for another man; with that inclination of her head but reversed toward other lips; with all the marks of affection, now given to another man, that she had given him.","But then, at once, his jealousy, as it had been the shadow of his love, presented him with the complement, with the converse of that new smile with which she had greeted him that very evening,—with which, now, perversely, she was mocking Swann while she tendered her love to another—of that lowering of her head, but lowered now to fall on other lips, and (but bestowed upon a stranger) of all the marks of affection that she had shewn to him."
"À la grande surprise de MmeVerdurin, il ne lâcha jamais. Il allait les rejoindre n’importe où, quelquefois dans les restaurants de banlieue où on allait peu encore, car ce n’était pas la saison, plus souvent au théâtre, que MmeVerdurin aimait beaucoup ; et comme un jour, chez elle, elle dit devant lui que pour les soirs de première, de gala, un coupefile leur eût été fort utile, que cela les avait beaucoup gênés de ne pas en avoir le jour de l’enterrement de Gambetta, Swann qui ne parlait jamais de ses relations brillantes, mais seulement de celles mal cotées qu’il eût jugé peu délicat de cacher, et au nombre desquelles il avait pris dans le faubourg Saint-Germain l’habitude de ranger les relations avec le monde officiel, répondit :","To Madame Verdurin's great surprise, he never let go. He went to join them anywhere, sometimes in restaurants in the suburbs where people rarely went, for it was not the season, more often at the theatre, which Madame Verdurin was very fond of; and as one day, at home, she said in front of him that for the evenings of the premiere, of the gala, a queue jumper would have been very useful to them, that it had greatly embarrassed them not to have one on the day of Gambetta's funeral, Swann, who never spoke of his brilliant connections, but only of those with low ratings which he would have deemed difficult to hide, and among which he had taken to the habit of classifying relations with the official world in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. , replied:","To Mme. Verdurin’s great surprise, he never abandoned them. He went to meet them wherever they were, sometimes in restaurants in the outlying districts where no one went much yet, because it was not the season, more often to the theater, which Mme. Verdurin liked very much; and because one day, at her house, she said in his presence that on evenings when there were premieres, or galas, a pass would have been very useful to them, that it had inconvenienced them very much not to have one the day of Gambetta’s funeral,18 Swann, who never talked about his distinguished connections, but only about those which were not very highly esteemed, which he thought it indelicate to conceal, and among which he had, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, fallen into the habit of including his relations with the official world, answered:","Greatly to Mme. Verdurin's surprise, he never failed them. He would go to meet them, no matter where, at restaurants outside Paris (not that they went there much at first, for the season had not yet begun), and more frequently at the play, in which Mme. Verdurin delighted. One evening, when they were dining at home, he heard her complain that she had not one of those permits which would save her the trouble of waiting at doors and standing in crowds, and say how useful it would be to them at first-nights, and gala performances at the Opera, and what a nuisance it had been, not having one, on the day of Gambetta's funeral. Swann never spoke of his distinguished friends, but only of such as might be regarded as detrimental, whom, therefore, he thought it snobbish, and in not very good taste to conceal; while he frequented the Faubourg Saint-Germain he had come to include, in the latter class, all his friends in the official world of the Third Republic, and so broke in, without thinking: ""I'll see to that, all right."
