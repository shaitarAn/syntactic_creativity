"« Joannetti, fermez les portes et les fenêtres. – Je ne veux plus voir la lumière ; qu’aucun homme n’entre dans ma chambre ; – mettez mon sabre à la portée de ma main ; – sortez vous-même, et ne reparaissez plus devant moi !","“Joannetti, close the doors and windows. “I no longer want to see the light; let no man enter my room; – put my saber within reach of my hand; – come out yourself, and do not appear before me again!","Joannetti! shut the door and windows! I do not wish to see the light! Let no one enter my room. Put my sword within reach. Go out yourself, and keep away from me.","* “Joanetti!

"Comment et pourquoi cette rose sèche se trouve sur une tablette de mon bureau, c’est ce que je ne dirai certainement pas, parce que j’ai déclaré qu’une rose sèche ne mérite pas un chapitre.","How and why this dry rose is on a shelf in my office, I will certainly not say, because I have declared that a dry rose does not deserve a chapter.","Why and wherefore that rose is upon my shelf, I shall certainly not explain, for, as I said before, a withered rose does not deserve a chapter.","How and why this withered rose happens to be on a shelf over my desk, I certainly shall never tell, for I said that a withered rose did not merit a chapter."

"J’avais couché mes pincettes sur la braise pour faire griller mon pain ; et, quelque temps après, tandis que mon âme voyageait, voilà qu’une souche enflammée roule sur le foyer : – ma pauvre bête porta la main aux pincettes, et je me brûlai les doigts.","I had laid my tongs on the coals to toast my bread; and, some time later, while my soul was traveling, behold, a flaming stump rolls over the hearth: – my poor beast put his hand to the tongs, and I burned my fingers.","I had rested my tongs on the embers to toast my bread, and some little time afterwards, while my soul was travelling, a burning stick fell on the hearth: my poor animal seized the tongs, and I burnt my fingers.

"L’agitation de la plus noble partie de moi-même se communiquait à l’autre, et celle-ci à son tour agissait puissamment sur mon âme. – J’étais parvenu tout entier à un état difficile à décrire, lorsque enfin mon âme, soit par sagacité, soit par hasard, trouva la manière de se délivrer des gazes qui la suffoquaient. Je ne sais si elle rencontra une ouverture, ou si elle s’avisa tout simplement de les relever, ce qui est plus naturel ; le fait est qu’elle trouva l’issue du labyrinthe. Les tresses de cheveux en désordre étaient toujours là ; mais ce n’était plus un obstacle, c’était plutôt un moyen : mon âme le saisit, comme un homme qui se noie s’accroche aux herbes du rivage ; mais le collier de perles se rompit dans l’action, et les perles se défilant roulèrent sur le sofa et de là sur le parquet de Mme de Hautcastel : car mon âme, par une bizarrerie dont il serait difficile de rendre raison, s’imaginait être chez cette dame ; un gros bouquet de violettes tomba par terre, et mon âme, s’éveillant alors, rentra chez elle, amenant à sa suite la raison et la réalité. Comme on l’imagine, elle désapprouva fortement tout ce qui s’était passé en son absence, et c’est ici que commence le dialogue qui fait l’objet de ce chapitre.","The agitation of the noblest part of myself was communicated to the other, and this in its turn acted powerfully on my soul. – I had completely arrived at a state difficult to describe, when at last my soul, either by sagacity or by chance, found the way to free itself from the gauzes which were suffocating it. I don't know if she encountered an opening, or if she simply took it into her head to pick them up, which is more natural; the fact is that she found the exit from the labyrinth. The messy hair braids were still there; but it was no longer an obstacle, it was rather a means: my soul seized it, as a drowning man clings to the grass of the shore; but the string of pearls broke in the action, and the unraveling pearls rolled onto the sofa and thence onto Madame de Hautcastel's floor: for my soul, by some oddity for which it would be difficult to explain, imagined to be with this lady; a large bouquet of violets fell to the ground, and my soul, waking then, returned home, bringing reason and reality in its wake. As one can imagine, she strongly disapproved of everything that had happened in her absence, and this is where the dialogue that is the subject of this chapter begins.","The agitation of the nobler part of myself communicated itself to the OTHER; and the latter, in its turn, reacted powerfully upon my soul. I worked myself, at last, into a state which it would be hard to describe, while my soul, either sagaciously or by chance, hit upon a way of escaping from the gauzes by which it was being suffocated. I know not whether she discovered an outlet, or whether, which is a more natural conclusion, it occurred to her to raise them: at all events, she found a means of egress from the labyrinth. The tresses of disheveled hair were still there; but they were now rather help than hindrance; my soul seized them, as a drowning man clutches the sedge on a river’s bank, but the pearl necklace broke in the act, and the unstrung pearls rolled on the sofa, and from the sofa to Madame Hautcastel’s floor (for my soul, by an eccentricity for which it would be difficult to give a reason, fancied she was at that lady’s house); then a great bunch of violets fell to the ground, and my soul, which then awoke, returned home, bringing with her common sense and reality. She strongly disapproved, as you will readily imagine, of all that had passed in her absence; and here it is that the dialogue begins which forms the subject of this chapter.","The agitation of the noblest part of myself was imparted to the other, and then he, in turn, exerted his own powerful influence upon my soul.—I had fully reached a state difficult to describe, when my soul, either by cleverness or by chance, suddenly discovered the way to free herself from the veils that were suffocating her. I do not know whether she found an opening or simply took it upon herself to remove them, which would have been more natural; in any event, she found her way out of the labyrinth. The tangled braids of hair were still there, but they were no longer an obstacle; they were, rather, a means of escape: my soul seized them as a drowning man fastens on to the grasses of the riverbank, but the pearl necklace broke in the process, and the pearls came unstrung, rolling onto the sofa and thence onto the parquet of Mme de Hautcastel;—for my soul, in an extravagance that would be difficult to explain, imagined she was at that Lady’s home: a large bouquet of violets fell to the floor, and my soul, then waking, returned home, bringing reason and reality with her.

"Est-il en effet d’être assez malheureux, assez abandonné, pour n’avoir pas de réduit où il puisse se retirer et se cacher à tout le monde ?

"Et pourquoi refuserais-je mon affection à cet être caressant qui n’a jamais cessé de m’aimer depuis l’époque où nous avons commencé de vivre ensemble ? Ma mémoire ne suffirait pas à faire l’énumération des personnes qui se sont intéressées à moi et qui m’ont oublié. J’ai eu quelques amis, plusieurs maîtresses, une foule de liaisons, encore plus de connaissances ; – et maintenant je ne suis plus rien pour tout ce monde, qui a oublié jusqu’à mon nom.","And why would I refuse my affection to this caressing being who has never stopped loving me since the time when we began to live together?

My memory would not enable me to enumerate all the people who have interested themselves in me but to forget me. I have had some few friends, several lady-loves, a host of acquaintances; and now I am to all these people as if I had never lived; they have forgotten my very name.","How could I ever deny affection to this tender creature that has never ceased loving me since the day we began living together? It would be beyond my memory’s power to enumerate all the people who once took an interest in me only to forget me.

"Mais l’aube matinale commence à blanchir le ciel ; les noires idées qui m’agitaient s’évanouissent avec la nuit, et l’espérance renaît dans mon cœur. – Non, celui qui inonde ainsi l’orient de lumière ne l’a point fait briller à mes regards pour me plonger bientôt dans la nuit du néant. Celui qui étendit cet horizon incommensurable, celui qui éleva ces masses énormes, dont le soleil dore les sommets glacés, est aussi celui qui a ordonné à mon cœur de battre et à mon esprit de penser.","But the morning dawn begins to whiten the sky; the dark ideas which agitated me vanish with the night, and hope is reborn in my heart. – No, he who thus floods the Orient with light has not made it shine before my eyes to plunge me soon into the night of nothingness.

The gloomy thoughts that troubled me vanish with the darkness, and hope awakens again in my heart. No! He who thus suffuses the east with light, has not made it to shine upon my eyes only to plunge me into the night of annihilation. He who has spread out that vast horizon, who raised those lofty mountains whose icy tops the sun is even now gilding, is also He who made my heart to beat, and my mind to think.","But the glow of daybreak now begins to brighten the sky; the dark thoughts troubling me vanish with the night, and hope is reborn in my heart.—No, he who thus floods the East with light does not make it shine in my eyes only to plunge me shortly into the night of nothingness.

"Lorsque je veux me donner ensuite une scène d’enthousiasme, et jouir de toutes les forces de mon imagination, je m’attache hardiment aux plis de la robe flottante du sublime aveugle d’Albion, au moment où il s’élance dans le ciel, et qu’il ose approcher du trône de l’Éternel. – Quelle muse a pu le soutenir à cette hauteur, où nul homme avant lui n’avait osé porter ses regards ? – De l’éblouissant parvis céleste que l’avare Mammon regardait avec des yeux d’envie, je passe avec horreur dans les vastes cavernes du séjour de Satan ; – j’assiste au conseil infernal, je me mêle à la foule des esprits rebelles, et j’écoute leurs discours.","When I want to give myself afterwards a scene of enthusiasm, and enjoy all the forces of my imagination, I attach myself boldly to the folds of the floating dress of the sublime blind man of Albion, at the moment when he soars into the sky. , and dare to approach the throne of the Lord. – What muse could support him at this height, where no man before him had dared to raise his gaze? – From the dazzling celestial court which the miser Mammon gazed with eyes of envy, I pass with horror into the vast caverns of Satan's abode; – I attend the infernal council, I mingle with the crowd of rebellious spirits, and I listen to their speeches.","When I would visit a scene full of enthusiasm, and put forth all the strength of my imagination, I cling boldly to the flowing robe of the sublime blind poet of Albion at the moment when he soars heavenward, and dares approach the throne of the Eternal. What muse was able to sustain him in a flight so lofty that no man before him ever ventured to raise his eyes so high? From heaven’s dazzling pavement which avaricious Mammon looked down upon with envious eyes, I pass, horror-stricken, to the vast caverns of Satan’s sojourn. I take my place at the infernal council, mingle with the host of rebellious spirits, and listen to their discourse.","Then, when I wish to afford myself a view of divine inspiration and to delight in all the powers of my imagination, I cling fearlessly to the flowing robe of Albion’s sublime blind poet as he prepares to soar heavenward and dares to approach the throne of the Eternal.—What Muse could have sustained him at such a lofty height, whither no man before him had ever dared lift his eyes?—And from Heaven’s dazzling vault upon which Mammon gazed with eyes of envy, I descend, in horror, into the vast caverns of Satan’s abode;—I take part in the Infernal Council; I join the crowd of rebellious spirits and listen to their speeches.—"
"Mais pour son élégante amie, j’avoue humblement que ce fut l’autre qui lui fit signe. – Cependant, quand j’y pense, je serais tenté d’éprouver un petit mouvement d’orgueil ; car il est clair que dans ce songe la balance en faveur de la raison était de quatre contre un. – C’est beaucoup pour un militaire de mon âge.","But for her elegant friend, I humbly confess that it was the other who beckoned her. – However, when I think of it, I would be tempted to experience a little movement of pride; for it is clear that in this dream the balance in favor of reason was four to one. “That’s a lot for a soldier my age.","But as to his graceful friend, I humbly own that it was the OTHER who beckoned her to come. Still, however, when I think of the interview, I am tempted to feel some little pride, for it is evident that in this dream the balance in favor of reason was as four to one. Pretty fair this, methinks, for a lieutenant.","As for his lovely companion,* I humbly confess that it was the other who had called her to mind. When I think about it, however, I feel a tempting flutter of pride; for it is clear that in this daydream, the balance was four to one in favor of reason.—No small thing for a lieutenant. Be that as it may, as I abandoned myself to these reflections, my eyes managed to shut and I fell into a deep sleep; yet as I closed my eyes, the images of the people I had been thinking of remained painted on that fine canvas that we call memory, and as these images mingled in my brain with the idea of the evocation of the dead, I soon saw arrive, one after another, Hippocrates, Plato, Pericles, Aspasia, and Doctor Cigna in his wig."
"Malgré la supériorité qu’il en acquérait sur moi, il ne sentit pas le moindre mouvement d’orgueil, et ne chercha point à profiter de son avantage. – Après un petit moment de silence, il prit le portrait, le remit à sa place, et se retira légèrement sur la pointe du pied. – Il sentait bien que sa présence était une espèce d’humiliation pour moi, et sa délicatesse lui suggéra de se retirer sans m’en laisser apercevoir. – Sa conduite, dans cette occasion, m’intéressa vivement, et le plaça toujours plus avant dans mon cœur. Il aura sans doute une place dans celui du lecteur ; et s’il en est quelqu’un assez insensible pour la lui refuser après avoir lu le chapitre suivant, le ciel lui a sans doute donné un cœur de marbre.","Despite the superiority he acquired over me, he did not feel the slightest movement of pride, and did not seek to take advantage of his advantage. – After a moment of silence, he took the portrait, put it back in its place, and retired slightly on tiptoe. “He felt that his presence was a kind of humiliation for me, and his delicacy suggested that he withdraw without letting me notice. “His conduct, on this occasion, interested me deeply, and placed him always nearer in my heart. It will undoubtedly have a place in that of the reader; and if there is one so insensitive as to refuse it to him after reading the next chapter, heaven has doubtless given him a heart of marble.","Notwithstanding the superiority he had hereby gained over me, he felt no movement of pride, and did not seek to profit by his advantage. After a moment’s silence, he took the picture, put it back in its place, and withdrew softly on tip-toe. He felt that his presence was a sort of humiliation to me, and his delicacy of feeling led him thus to retire unobserved. His behavior on this occasion interested me greatly, and gave him a higher place than ever in my affections. And he will have too, without doubt, a place in the heart of my readers. If there be one among them who will refuse it him after reading the next chapter, such a one must surely have a heart of stone.","Despite the advantage he thus gained over me, he felt not the slightest hint of pride, and made no attempt to profit from this ascendancy.—After a brief moment of silence, he took the portrait, returned it to its place, and withdrew lightly on tiptoe.—He was keenly aware that his presence was a sort of humiliation for me, and his sense of tact told him he should withdraw, without my noticing.—His behavior on this occasion impressed me greatly and brought him forever closer to my heart. No doubt he will also find a place in the reader’s heart; and if, after reading the chapter to follow, there is anyone so insensitive to deny him that, then heaven must have given him a heart of stone."
"Le trouble de l’amour, l’espoir du bonheur n’inondent-ils pas notre cœur de sensations aussi vives que variées !","The trouble of love, the hope of happiness, do they not flood our hearts with sensations as lively as they are varied!","The excitement of love, and the anticipation of happiness, do they not fill our hearts to the brim with emotions no less lively and various?","Do not love’s turmoil and the hope of happiness flood our hearts with sensations as keen as they are diverse?—The spectacle of nature, its contemplation as a whole and in its details, affords the mind a vast, open field of delights."

"Je tiens d’un vieux professeur (c’est du plus loin qu’il me souvienne) que Platon appelait la matière l’autre. C’est fort bien ; mais j’aimerais mieux donner ce nom par excellence à la bête qui est jointe à notre âme. C’est réellement cette substance qui est l’autre, et qui nous lutine d’une manière si étrange. On s’aperçoit bien en gros que l’homme est double, mais c’est, dit-on, parce qu’il est composé d’une âme et d’un corps ; et l’on accuse ce corps de je ne sais combien de choses, mais bien mal à propos assurément, puisqu’il est aussi incapable de sentir que de penser. C’est à la, bête qu’il faut s’en prendre, à cet être sensible, parfaitement distinct de l’âme, véritable individu, qui a son existence séparée, ses goûts, ses inclinations, sa volonté, et qui n’est au-dessus des autres animaux que parce qu’il est mieux élevé et pourvu d’organes plus parfaits.","I learned from an old professor (it is as far back as I can remember) that Plato called matter the other. It is very good; but I would rather give this name par excellence to the beast which is joined to our soul. It is really this substance which is the other, and which lures us in such a strange way. We realize very roughly that man is double, but it is, they say, because he is composed of a soul and a body; and we accuse this body of I don't know how many things, but very badly certainly, since it is as incapable of feeling as of thinking. It is the beast that must be blamed, this sentient being, perfectly distinct from the soul, a true individual, which has its separate existence, its tastes, its inclinations, its will, and which does not is above other animals only because he is better brought up and provided with more perfect organs.","I have it from an old professor (and this is as long ago as I can remember), that Plato used to call matter the OTHER. This is all very well; but I prefer giving this name par excellence to the animal which is joined to our soul. This substance it is which is really the OTHER, and which plays such strange tricks upon us. It is easy enough to see, in a sort of general way, that man is twofold. But this, they say, is because he is made up of soul and body; and they accuse the body of I don’t know how many things, and very inconsistently, seeing that it can neither feel nor think. It is upon the animal that the blame should fall; upon that sensitive being, which, while it is perfectly distinct from the soul, is a real individual, enjoying a separate existence, with its own tastes, inclinations, and will, and which only ranks higher than other animals, because it is better educated than they, and is provided with more perfect organs.","An old professor once told me (that’s as much as I can remember) that Plato called matter the other. That’s quite good, yet I would rather give that quintessential name to the beast that is united with our soul. For that substance is the real other and pesters us in a most distressing manner. It is rather frequently observed that man is twofold, but this is, they say, because he is made up of a soul and a body; and this body is accused of I know not how many dreadful things, quite inappropriately I am sure, since it is as incapable of feeling as it is of thinking. The real culprit is the beast, that sentient being utterly distinct from the soul, that veritable individual that has his own separate existence, tastes, inclinations and will, and is superior to the other animals only because he happens to be a little more well-bred and endowed with more perfect organs."

"Mais comment aurait-elle fait attention à moi ? elle était occupée à se regarder elle-même. Debout devant un grand miroir, toute coiffée, elle mettait la dernière main à sa parure : elle était si fort préoccupée, son attention était si totalement absorbée par des rubans, des gazes et des pompons de toute espèce, amoncelés devant elle, que je n’obtins pas même un regard, un signe. Je me résignai : je tenais humblement des épingles toutes prêtes, arrangées dans ma main ; mais, son carreau se trouvait plus à sa portée, elle les prenait à son carreau, – et, si j’avançais la main, elle les prenait de ma main – indifféremment ; – et pour les prendre elle tâtonnait, sans ôter les yeux de son miroir, de crainte de se perdre de vue.","But how would she have paid attention to me? she was busy looking at herself. Standing in front of a large mirror, all her hair done, she was putting the finishing touches to her finery: she was so preoccupied, her attention was so totally absorbed by the ribbons, gauzes and pompoms of all kinds, piled up in front of her, that I couldn't didn't even get a look, a sign. I resigned myself: I humbly held pins ready, arranged in my hand; but, her diamond was more within reach, she took them from her diamond – and, if I put out my hand, she took them from my hand – indifferently; – and to take them she groped her way, without taking her eyes off her mirror, for fear of losing sight of herself.","And how could she have given me any of her attention? She was engaged in looking at herself. There she stood before a large mirror; her hair was ornamented for a fête, and the decorations of her dress were undergoing their final arrangement. She was so fully occupied, her attention was so totally absorbed by the ribbons, gauzes, and all sorts of finery that lay in heaps before her, that I did not get a look or any sign of recognition. There was nothing for me but resignation. I held out humbly in my hand a number of pins arranged in order. But her pincushion being more within reach, she took them from her pincushion, and when I brought my hand nearer, she took them from my hand, quite indifferently, and in taking them up she would feel about for them with the tips of her fingers, without taking her eyes from the glass, lest she should lose sight of herself.","how could she ever notice me, when she was so busy looking at herself? Standing before a tall mirror, her hair all dressed, she was putting the last touches on her toilette; indeed so preoccupied was she, her attention so utterly absorbed in the ribbons, veils, and finery of every sort piled up before her, that I received not even a glance or a sign.—I resigned myself: humbly, I held out a ready assortment of pins in my hand; but since her pin cushion was within easier reach, she took her pins from there;—if I extended my hand, she did take them, indifferently, from there as well, though groping about, never removing her eyes from the mirror, lest she should lose sight of herself."
"Comme il est ressemblant ! – Voilà bien les traits que la nature avait donnés au plus vertueux des hommes.

"Il le disait à tout le monde, un peu pour soutenir la gageure, un peu aussi parce qu’il croyait l’être tout de bon. – Insensiblement l’influence de la robe de chambre opérait : les bouillons qu’il avait pris, bon gré, mal gré, lui causaient des nausées ; bientôt les parents et amis envoyaient demander des nouvelles : il n’en fallait pas tant pour le mettre décidément au lit.","He said it to everyone, a little to support the bet, a little also because he thought he was really. – Insensibly the influence of the dressing gown operated: the broths which he had taken, willy-nilly, caused him nausea; soon relatives and friends sent to ask for news: it did not take so much to put him decidedly to bed.","He told every one he was not very well, partly for the sake of appearances, and partly because he positively believed himself to be indisposed. Gradually the influence of the dressing-gown began to work. The slops he was obliged to take upset his stomach. His relations and friends sent to ask after him. He was soon quite ill enough to take to his bed.","He said so to everyone, in part to keep up appearances, in part because he really believed that was how he felt.—Imperceptibly, the dressing gown exerted its influence; the broths he had drunk, willynilly, nauseated him; soon relatives and friends were inquiring after his health; that was more than enough to put him decidedly to bed."
"On m’avouera qu’il n’est pas possible de désapprouver ma pensée avec plus d’esprit et de discrétion : aussi je ne résiste jamais à cette invitation tacite ; j’étends les bras pour lui témoigner que j’ai compris, et me voilà assis.","It will be admitted to me that it is not possible to disapprove of my thought with more wit and discretion: so I never resist this tacit invitation; I stretch out my arms to show him that I have understood, and here I am seated.","It must be admitted that it would be impossible to show disapproval of my idleness with greater judgment and address. I never resist this tacit invitation, but, stretching out my arms to show I understand him, get up at once.","It must be admitted that one could not protest my laziness with more wit or discretion. And indeed, I can never resist this tacit invitation: I stretch out my arms to show him that I have understood, and I sit up at once."
"Entre ces deux tiroirs est un enfoncement où je jette les lettres à mesure que je les reçois ; on trouve là toutes celles que j’ai reçues depuis dix ans ; les plus anciennes sont rangées selon leur date, en plusieurs paquets ; les nouvelles sont pêle-mêle ; il m’en reste plusieurs qui datent de ma première jeunesse.","Between these two drawers is a recess where I throw the letters as I receive them; one finds there all those which I received for ten years; the oldest are arranged according to their date, in several packages; the news is pell-mell; I still have several that date from my early youth.","Between these two drawers is a recess into which I throw whatever letters I receive. All that have reached me during the last ten years are there. The oldest of them are arranged according to date in several packets; the new ones lie pell-mell. Besides these, I have several dating from my early boyhood.",Between these two drawers there is a hollow in which I toss my letters as I receive them. There you will find every letter I have received in the last ten years; the oldest are arranged in several packets according to their dates; the new ones are all jumbled together. I even have several from my early youth.

J’ai dit que j’aimais singulièrement à méditer dans la douce chaleur de mon lit et que sa couleur agréable contribue beaucoup au plaisir que j’y trouve.,I have said that I particularly like to meditate in the soft warmth of my bed and that its pleasant color contributes much to the pleasure I find there.,Joannetti. I REMARKED that I was singularly fond of meditating when influenced by the agreeable warmth of my bed; and that its agreeable color added not a little to the pleasure I experienced.,"I have said that I am particularly fond of meditating in the sweet warmth of my bed, and that its delightful color plays a large part in the pleasure I take in it."
"C’est aujourd’hui donc que je suis libre ou plutôt que je vais rentrer dans les fers ! Le joug des affaires va de nouveau peser sur moi ; je ne ferai plus un pas qui ne soit mesuré par la bienséance et le devoir. – Heureux encore si quelque déesse capricieuse ne me fait pas oublier l’un et l’autre, et si j’échappe à cette nouvelle et dangereuse captivité !","It is today therefore that I am free or rather that I will go back to irons! The yoke of business will again weigh on me; I will no longer take a step that is not measured by propriety and duty. “Happy still if some capricious goddess does not make me forget both, and if I escape this new and dangerous captivity!","I am now free, then; or rather, I must enter again into bondage. The yoke of office is again to weigh me down, and every step I take must conform with the exigencies of politeness and duty. Fortunate shall I be if some capricious goddess do not again make me forget both, and if I escape from this new and dangerous captivity.","So today is the day of my freedom, or rather the day that I shall put my shackles back on. The yoke of worldly matters will weigh heavy on me once again; I shall no longer take a single step that is not measured by decorum and duty.—And I shall be happy simply if some capricious goddess does not make me forget both! And if I can escape this new and dangerous captivity!"
"« Ce n’est pas un crâne lui répondit le docteur en prenant sa perruque et la jetant au feu ; c’est une perruque, mademoiselle, et je ne sais pourquoi je n’ai pas jeté cet ornement ridicule dans les flammes du Tartare lorsque j’arrivai parmi vous : mais les ridicules et les préjugés sont si fort inhérents à notre misérable nature, qu’ils nous suivent encore quelque temps au delà du tombeau. Je prenais un plaisir singulier à voir le docteur abjurer ainsi tout à la fois sa médecine et sa perruque.","“It is not a skull,” replied the doctor, taking his wig and throwing it into the fire; it is a wig, mademoiselle, and I do not know why I did not throw this ridiculous ornament into the flames of Tartarus when I arrived among you: but ridicule and prejudice are so strongly inherent in our miserable nature, that 'they follow us for some time beyond the tomb. I took a singular pleasure in seeing the doctor thus abjure both his medicine and his wig.","“It is no skull,” said the doctor, addressing her, and taking off his wig, which he threw on the fire, “it is a wig, madam; and I know not why I did not cast this ridiculous ornament into the flames of Tartarus when first I came among you. But absurdities and prejudices adhere so closely to our miserable nature that they even follow us sometimes beyond the grave.” I took singular pleasure in seeing the doctor thus abjure his physic and his wig at the same moment.","“It’s not a skull,” replied the doctor, taking his wig in hand and tossing it into the fire, “it’s a wig, Mademoiselle, and I know not why I did not throw this ridiculous ornament into the flames of Tartarus when I first arrived among you. But ridiculous customs and prejudices are so deeply ingrained in our petty nature that they follow us for a while even beyond the grave. ”—I was singularly amused to see doctor abjure at once his medicine and his wig."
"Les estampes et les tableaux dont je viens de parler pâlissent et disparaissent au premier coup d’œil qu’on jette sur le tableau vivant : les ouvrages immortels de Raphaël, de Corrège et de toute l’Ecole d’Italie ne soutiendraient pas le parallèle. Aussi je le garde toujours pour le dernier morceau, pour la pièce de réserve, lorsque je procure à quelques curieux le plaisir de voyager avec moi ; et je puis assurer que, depuis que je fais voir ce tableau sublime aux connaisseurs et aux ignorants, aux gens du monde, aux artisans, aux femmes et aux enfants, aux animaux même, j’ai toujours vu les spectateurs quelconques donner, chacun à sa manière, des signes de plaisir et d’étonnement : tant la nature y est admirablement rendue !","The prints and paintings of which I have just spoken turn pale and disappear at the first glance that one casts on the living picture: the immortal works of Raphael, Correggio and the whole School of Italy would not support the parallel . So I always keep it for the last piece, for the spare piece, when I give a few curious people the pleasure of traveling with me; and I can assure you that, ever since I showed this sublime picture to connoisseurs and the ignorant, to people in the world, to craftsmen, to women and children, even to animals, I have always seen ordinary spectators give, each to its way, signs of pleasure and astonishment: so admirably is nature rendered there!","A Perfect Picture. MY engravings, and the paintings of which I have spoken, fade away into nothing at the first glance bestowed upon the next picture. The immortal works of Raphael and Correggio, and of the whole Italian school, are not to be compared to it. Hence it is that when I accord to an amateur the pleasure of travelling with me, I always keep this until the last as a special luxury, and ever since I first exhibited this sublime picture to connoisseurs and to ignorant, to men of the world, to artists, to women, to children, to animals even , I have always found the spectators, whoever they might be, show, each in his own way, signs of pleasure and surprise, so admirably is nature rendered therein.","The prints and paintings of which I have just spoken pale and cease to exist the moment one sets one’s eyes on the picture that follows; indeed the immortal works of Raphael, Correggio, and the entire Italian school suffer from the comparison. I always save it for last, as the pièce de réserve, whenever I grant some interested wayfarer the pleasure of traveling with me; and I assure you that ever since I have been showing this sublime image to connoisseurs and illiterates, to sophisticates, artisans, women, children, and even to animals , I have always seen the spectators show, each in his own way, signs of pleasure and astonishment, so admirably is nature rendered in it."

"Périclès, qui s’était approché de la fenêtre, fit un gros soupir, dont je devinai la cause. Il lisait un numéro du Moniteur qui annonçait la décadence des arts et des sciences ; il voyait des savants illustres quitter leurs sublimes spéculations peur inventer de nouveaux crimes ; et il frémissait d’entendre une horde de cannibales se comparer aux héros de la généreuse Grèce, en faisant périr sur l’échafaud, sans honte et sans remords, des vieillards vénérables, des femmes, des enfants, et commettant de sang-froid les crimes les plus atroces et les plus inutiles.","Pericles, who had approached the window, heaved a deep sigh, the cause of which I guessed.

He was reading a number of the “Moniteur,” which announced the decadence of the arts and sciences. He saw illustrious scholars desert their sublime conceptions to invent new crimes, and shuddered at hearing a rabble herd compare themselves with the heroes of generous Greece; and this, forsooth, because they put to death, without shame or remorse, venerable old men, women, and children, and coolly perpetrated the blackest and most useless crimes.","Pericles, who had approached the window, heaved a great sigh, of which I guessed the cause.

"« Croirai-je, lui répondis-je alors, que ces grands hommes ignorent tout ce que vous venez de leur dire, et que leur âme dégagée des entraves de la matière, trouve quelque chose d’obscur dans toute la nature ? – Ah ! quelle est votre erreur ! s’écria le proto-médecin du Péloponèse ; les mystères de la nature sont cachés aux morts comme aux vivants ; celui qui a créé et qui dirige tout sait lui seul le grand secret auquel les hommes s’efforcent en vain d’atteindre : voilà ce que nous apprenons de certain sur les bords du Styx ; et, croyez-moi, ajouta-t-il en adressant la parole au docteur, dépouillez-vous de ce reste d’esprit de corps que vous avez apporté du séjour des mortels ; et puisque les travaux de mille générations et toutes les découvertes des hommes n’ont pu allonger d’un seul instant leur existence ; puisque Caron passe chaque jour dans sa barque une égale quantité d’ombres, ne nous fatiguons plus à défendre un art qui, chez les morts où nous sommes, ne serait pas même utile aux médecins. » Ainsi parla le fameux Hippocrate, à mon grand étonnement.","“Shall I believe,” I answered him then, “that these great men are unaware of everything you have just told them, and that their soul, freed from the shackles of matter, finds something obscure in all nature? – Ah! what is your mistake! cried the proto-doctor of Peloponnesus; the mysteries of nature are hidden from the dead as well as from the living; he who created and who directs everything alone knows the great secret which men strive in vain to reach: this is what we learn for certain on the banks of the Styx; and, believe me,” he added, speaking to the doctor, “divest yourself of that remnant of esprit de corps which you have brought from mortal abode; and since the work of a thousand generations and all the discoveries of men have not been able to lengthen their existence for a single instant; since Caron spends an equal number of shadows in his boat every day, we no longer tire ourselves of defending an art which, among the dead where we are, would not even be useful to doctors. So spoke the famous Hippocrates, to my astonishment.","“But am I to believe,” I replied, “that these great men were ignorant of all you have been telling them, and that their souls, having shuffled off this mortal coil, still meet with any obscurities in nature?” “Ah! how great is your error!” exclaimed the proto-physician[12] of the Peloponnesus. The mysteries of nature are as closely hidden from the dead as from the living. Of one thing we who linger on the banks of the Styx are certain, that He who created all things alone knows the great secret which men vainly strive to solve. “And,” added he, turning to the doctor, “do be persuaded by me to divest yourself of what still clings to you of the party-spirit you have brought with you from the sojourn of mortals. And since, seeing that Charon daily ferries over in his boat as many shades as heretofore, the labors of a thousand generations and all the discoveries men have made have not been able to prolong their existence, let us not uselessly weary ourselves in defending an art which, among the dead, cannot even profit its practitioners.” Thus, to my great amazement, spoke the famous Hippocrates.","“Am I to believe,” I replied to him, “that these great men know nothing of what you have just told them, and that their souls, released from the shackles of matter, find all of nature somewhat obscure?” “Ah, how mistaken you are!” exclaimed the protophysician* of the Peloponnesus. “The mysteries of nature are concealed from the dead as from the living. Only he who created and rules all knows the great secret that men strive in vain to attain: that is the only sure thing we learn on the banks of the Styx. And take my advice,” he said, turning to the doctor, “cast aside that remnant of esprit de corps that you have brought with you from the realm of the living. Since the labors of a thousand generations, and all the discoveries man has ever made, have not prolonged human life by so much as an instant, and since Charon each day ferries an equal number of shades in his bark, let us cease to trouble ourselves uselessly defending an art that, in the land of the dead where we are, would not be of any use even to doctors.” Thus spoke the celebrated Hippocrates, to my great astonishment."
"Mon âme vit bien qu’elle ne jouait pas le meilleur rôle dans cette occasion ; – elle commençait d’ailleurs à s’apercevoir que la chaleur de la dispute en avait supprimé la cause, et profitant de la circonstance pour faire une diversion : « Faites du café », dit-elle à Joannetti, qui entrait dans la chambre. – Le bruit des tasses attirant toute l’attention de l’insurgente, dans l’instant elle oublia tout le reste. C’est ainsi qu’en montrant un hochet aux enfants, on leur fait oublier les fruits malsains qu’ils demandent en trépignant.","My soul saw well that it did not play the best part on this occasion; – she was beginning, moreover, to perceive that the heat of the argument had removed the cause, and taking advantage of the circumstance to make a diversion: “Make some coffee,” she said to Joannetti, who entered the room. – The noise of the cups attracting all the attention of the insurgent, in an instant she forgot all the rest. This is how by showing a rattle to children, we make them forget the unhealthy fruits they ask for while stamping their feet.","My soul saw very well that the part she was playing on this occasion was no flattering one. She began, too, to perceive that the warmth of the dispute had put the cause of it out of sight. Profiting from this circumstance, she caused a further distraction by saying to Joannetti, who at that moment entered the room, “Make some coffee!” The noise of the cups attracted all the rebel’s attention, who forthwith forgot everything else. In like manner we show children a toy to make them forget the unwholesome fruit for which they beg and stamp.","My soul saw clearly that she was not playing the better part on this occasion;—she was beginning, moreover, to realize that the heat of the dispute had effaced the cause, and so, taking advantage of the circumstance to create a diversion, “Go make some coffee,” she said to Joanetti, as he entered the room. Once the tinkling of the cups attracted the insurgent’s full attention, he quickly forgot all the rest. In the same way, one shows a child a toy to make him forget the unwholesome fruit he demands with stamping feet."
"Je me garde encore avec plus de soin d’en tirer des conséquences générales sur la réalité, la force et la durée de l’affection des dames pour leurs amis. – Je me contente de jeter ce chapitre (puisque c’en est un), de le jeter, dis-je, dans le monde, avec le reste du voyage, sans l’adresser à personne, et sans le recommander à personne.","I am even more careful not to draw any general conclusions from it on the reality, the strength and the duration of the affection of ladies for their friends. – I content myself with throwing away this chapter (since it is one), throwing it, I say, into the world, with the rest of the voyage, without addressing it to anyone, and without recommending it to anyone.","I take special care to deduce therefrom no general conclusions about the reality, the strength, and the duration of the affection of ladies for their friends.

"Lorsque je porte la main dans ce réduit, il est rare que je m’en tire de toute la journée. C’est ainsi que le voyageur traverse rapidement quelques provinces d’Italie, en faisant à la hâte quelques observations superficielles, pour se fixer à Rome pendant des mois entiers. – C’est la veine la plus riche de la mine que j’exploite. Quel changement dans mes idées et dans mes sentiments ! quelle différence dans mes amis ! Lorsque je les examine alors et aujourd’hui, je les vois mortellement agités par des projets qui ne les touchent plus maintenant. Nous regardions comme un grand malheur un événement ; mais la fin de la lettre manque, et l’événement est complètement oublié : je ne puis savoir de quoi il était question. – Mille préjugés nous assiégeaient ; le monde et les hommes nous étaient totalement inconnus ; mais aussi quelle chaleur dans notre commerce ! quelle liaison intime ! quelle confiance sans bornes !","When I carry my hand in this den, it is rare that I get out of it all day. It is thus that the traveler rapidly crosses several provinces of Italy, hastily making a few superficial observations, to settle in Rome for whole months. – It is the richest vein of the mine that I operate. What a change in my ideas and feelings! what a difference in my friends! When I examine them then and now, I see them mortally agitated by projects that no longer touch them now. We regarded an event as a great misfortune; but the end of the letter is missing, and the event is completely forgotten: I cannot know what it was about. – A thousand prejudices besieged us; the world and men were totally unknown to us; but also what warmth in our business! what an intimate connection! what boundless confidence!","When I put my hand into this recess, I seldom leave the spot for the whole day. In like manner, a traveller will pass rapidly through whole provinces of Italy, making a few hurried and trivial observations on the way, and upon reaching Rome will take up his abode there for months. This is the richest vein in the mine I am exploring. How changed I find my ideas and sentiments, and how altered do my friends appear when I examine them as they were in days gone by, and as they are now! In these mirrors of the past I see them in mortal agitation about plans which no longer disturb them. Here I find an event announced which we evidently looked upon as a great misfortune; but the end of the letter is wanting, and the circumstance is so entirely forgotten that I cannot now make out what the matter was which so concerned us. We were possessed by a thousand prejudices. We knew nothing of the world, and of men. But then, how warm was our intercourse! How intimate our friendship! How unbounded our confidence!","When I put my hand inside that nook, rarely do I escape before the end of the day. Thus does the traveler pass quickly through a few Italian provinces, look at a few things in haste and superficially, only to settle in Rome for months at a time.—I work the mine’s richest vein: how my ideas have changed, and my feelings too! How different my friends are, when I look at them then and now! I see them madly driven by schemes that no longer move them at all! There was one event that we considered a great calamity—but the end of the letter is missing, and the event has been competely forgotten. I shall never know what it was.—We were besieged by a thousand preconceptions: we knew nothing of the world or the people in it; but on the other hand, what fervor in our intercourse! What intimate ties! What boundless confidence!"
"Mon âme, surprise de tant de vivacité et d’éloquence, ne savait que répondre. – Pour arranger l’affaire, elle entreprit de couvrir du voile de la bienveillance les reproches qu’elle venait de se permettre, et, afin de ne pas avoir l’air de faire les premiers pas vers la réconciliation, elle imagina de prendre aussi le ton de la cérémonie. – « Madame, » dit-elle à son tour avec une cordialité affectée… – (Si le lecteur a trouvé ce mot déplacé lorsqu’il s’adressait à mon âme, que dira-t-il maintenant, pour peu qu’il veuille se rappeler le sujet de la dispute ? – Mon âme ne sentit point l’extrême ridicule de cette façon de parler, tant la passion obscurcit l’intelligence !) – Madame, dit-elle donc, je vous assure que rien ne me ferait autant de plaisir que de vous voir jouir de tous les plaisirs dont votre nature est susceptible, quand même je ne les partagerais pas, si ces plaisirs ne vous étaient pas nuisibles et s’ils n’altéraient pas l’harmonie qui… » Ici mon âme fut interrompue vivement : « Non, non, je ne suis point la dupe de votre bienveillance supposée : – le séjour forcé que nous faisons ensemble dans cette chambre où nous voyageons ; la blessure que j’ai reçue, qui a failli me détruire et qui saigne encore ; tout cela n’est-il pas le fruit de votre orgueil extravagant et de vos préjugés barbares ?

My well-being and my very existence are counted for nothing when your passions carry you away – and you pretend to be interested in me, and your reproaches come from your friendship! »","My soul, surprised at so much vivacity and eloquence, did not know how to reply. In order to settle the dispute amicably, she endeavored to veil with the semblance of good-nature the reproaches that had escaped her. But, that she might not seem to take the first steps towards reconciliation, she affected a formal tone. “Madame,” she said, with assumed cordiality.... If the reader thought the word misplaced when addressed to my soul, what will he say of it now, if he call to mind the cause of the quarrel? But my soul did not feel the extreme absurdity of this mode of expression, so much does passion obscure the intellect! “Madame,” she said, “nothing, be assured, would give me so much pleasure as to see you enjoy those pleasures of which your nature is susceptible, if even I did not participate in them, were it not that such pleasures are harmful to you, injuriously affecting the harmony which....” Here my soul was rudely interrupted, “No, no, I am not the dupe of your pretended kindness. The sojourn we are compelled to make together in this room in which we travel; the wound which I received, which still bleeds, and which nearly destroyed me,—is not all this the fruit of your overweening conceit and your barbarous prejudices? My comfort, my very existence, is counted as nothing when your passions sway you: and then, forsooth, you pretend that you take an interest in my welfare, and that your insults spring from friendship.”","My soul, surprised by such spirit and eloquence, did not know what to reply.—To settle the matter, she attempted to cover in a veil of benevolence the reproaches to which she had just given vent; and to avoid the appearance of taking the first steps toward reconciliation, she likewise thought to assume a tone of ceremony.—“Monsieur,” she said in turn, with affected cordiality.—If the reader found such formality out of place when addressed to my soul, what will he say now, though he may well have no wish to recall the subject of the dispute?—My soul had no idea of the utter ridiculousness of this manner of speaking , so thoroughly does passion obfuscate the intellect!—“Monsieur,” she said, “I assure you that nothing would please me more than to see you enjoy all the pleasures of which your nature is capable, even when I may not share them, if these pleasures were not harmful to you and did not threaten the harmony that—” Here my soul was forcefully interrupted:—“No, no, I’ll not be fooled by your pretended benevolence;—our compulsory stay in this room of our voyage, the wound I received, which nearly destroyed me, and which still bleeds,—are not all these things the fruit of your immoderate pride and your barbarous prejudices? My well-being, indeed, my very existence count for nothing when you are swept away by your passions—and you claim to care about me? And that your reproaches are dictated by our friendship?”"

"A mesure que le linge enlevait la poussière et faisait paraître les boucles de cheveux blonds et la guirlande de roses dont ils sont couronnés, mon âme, depuis le soleil où elle s’était transportée, sentit un léger frémissement de cœur et partagea sympathiquement la jouissance de mon cœur. Cette jouissance devint moins confuse et plus vive lorsque le linge, d’un seul coup, découvrit le front éclatant de cette charmante physionomie ; mon âme fut sur le point de quitter les cieux pour jouir du spectacle. Mais se fût-elle trouvée dans les Champs-Elysées, eût-elle assisté à un concert de chérubins, elle n’y serait pas demeurée une demi-seconde, lorsque sa compagne, prenant toujours plus d’intérêt à son ouvrage, s’avisa de saisir une éponge mouillée qu’on lui présentait et de la passer tout à coup sur les sourcils et les yeux, – sur le nez, – sur les joues, – sur cette bouche ; – ah ! Dieu ! le cœur me bat – sur le menton, sur le sein : ce fut l’affaire d’un moment ; toute la figure parut renaître et sortir du néant. – Mon âme se précipita du ciel comme une étoile tombante ; elle trouva l’autre dans une extase ravissante, et parvint à l’augmenter en la partageant. Cette situation singulière et imprévue fit disparaître le temps et l’espace pour moi. – J’existai pour un instant dans le passé et je rajeunis, contre l’ordre de la nature. – Oui, la voilà, cette femme adorée, c’est elle-même, je la vois qui sourit ; elle va parler pour dire qu’elle m’aime. – Quel regard ! viens, que je te serre contre mon cœur, âme de ma vie, ma seconde existence ! viens partager mon ivresse et mon bonheur ! – Ce moment fut court, mais il fut ravissant : la froide raison reprit bientôt son empire, et, dans l’espace d’un clin d’œil, je vieillis d’une année entière : – mon cœur devint froid, glacé et je me trouvai de nouveau avec la foule des indifférents qui pèsent sur le globe.","As the linen removed the dust and showed the locks of blond hair and the garland of roses with which they are crowned, my soul, from the sun to which it had been transported, felt a slight quivering of the heart and sympathetically shared the enjoyment from my heart. This enjoyment became less confused and more vivid when the linen suddenly revealed the dazzling forehead of that charming countenance; my soul was about to leave the heavens to enjoy the spectacle. But had she been in the Champs-Elysées, had she attended a concert of cherubs, she would not have remained there for half a second, when her companion, taking ever more interest in her work, advised him to take a wet sponge which was offered to him and to pass it suddenly over the eyebrows and the eyes, – over the nose, – over the cheeks, – over this mouth; – oh! God ! my heart beats – on my chin, on my breast: it was a matter of a moment; the whole face seemed to be reborn and emerge from nothingness. – My soul rushed from heaven like a falling star; she found the other in a ravishing ecstasy, and succeeded in increasing it by sharing it. This singular and unforeseen situation made time and space disappear for me. – I existed for a moment in the past and I am rejuvenated, against the order of nature. – Yes, there she is, this adored woman, it is herself, I see her smiling; she will speak to say that she loves me. - What a look ! come, let me hug you to my heart, soul of my life, my second existence! come and share my intoxication and my happiness! – This moment was short, but it was delightful: cold reason soon resumed its empire, and, in the space of the twinkling of an eye, I aged a whole year: – my heart became cold, frozen and I I found myself again with the crowd of indifferent people who weigh on the globe.","Whilst the cloth removed the dust, and brought to light those flaxen curls and the wreaths of roses that crowned them, my soul, from the sun, whither she had transported herself, felt a slight thrill of pleasure, and partook sympathetically of the joy of my heart. This joy became less indistinct and more lively, when, by a single sweep, the beautiful forehead of that charming face was revealed. My soul was on the point of leaving the skies in order to enjoy the spectacle. But had she been in the Elysian Fields, had she been engaged in a seraphic concert , she could not have stayed a single second longer when her companion, glowing with the work, seized a proffered sponge, and passed it at once over the eyebrows and the eyes, over the nose, over that mouth, ah heavens!—my heart beats at the thought—over the chin and neck! It was the work of an instant. The whole face seemed suddenly recalled into existence. My soul precipitated herself like a falling star from the sky. She found the OTHER in a state of ecstasy, which she herself increased by sharing it. This strange and unexpected position caused all thought of time and space to vanish from my mind. I lived for a moment in the past, and, contrary to the order of nature, I grew young again. Yes, before me stands that adored one; ’tis she, her very self! She smiles on me, she will speak and own her love. That glance! ... come, let me press thee to my heart, O, my loved one, my other self! Partake with me this intoxicating bliss! The moment was short, but ravishing. Cool reason soon reasserted her sway, and in the twinkling of an eye I had grown a whole year older. My heart grew icy cold, and I found myself on a level with the crowd of heedless ones who throng the earth.","As the cloth removed the dust and began to uncover the blond curls and the garland of roses crowning them, my soul, from the distant sun to which she had flown, felt a gentle quiver of delight and sympathetically shared my heart’s joy. This joy became keener and less confused when the cloth, in a single stroke, revealed the stunning brow of that lovely countenance, and my soul made ready to quit the heavens to enjoy the spectacle. Even had she been in the Elysian Fields, or listening to a concert of cherubim, she would not have tarried half a second when her companion, taking ever greater interest in his work, thought to seize a wet sponge that had been brought and to run this at once over the eyebrows and eyes,—over the nose,—the cheeks,—and that mouth.—Oh, God! my heart is racing:—over the chin, the bosom; it took but a moment, and the entire figure seemed to return to life, to emerge from oblivion.—My soul dashed headlong from the sky like a falling star; she found the other in a state of rapt ecstasy, and succeeded in augmenting this by taking part in it. This unusual, unforeseen situation made time and space disappear for me.—For an instant, I existed in the past; I grew younger, contrary to the laws of nature.—Yes, there she is: the beloved woman. It is she, none other: I see her smiling; she is about to speak, to tell me she loves me.—What a gaze! Come closer and let me clutch you to my breast, light of my life, my second existence! Come and share my transport and my happiness.—This moment was brief, but entrancing. Soon cold reason resumed its rule, and in the twinkling of an eye I aged an entire year: my heart grew cold, icy, and I found myself again among the indifferent crowd weighing down the planet."

"Eh ! quel tableau pourrait-on vous présenter, messieurs ; quel spectacle pourrait-on mettre sous vos yeux, mesdames, plus sûr de votre suffrage que la fidèle représentation de vous-même ? Le tableau dont je parle est un miroir, et personne, jusqu’à présent, ne s’est encore avisé de le critiquer ; il est, pour tous ceux qui le regardent, un tableau parfait auquel il n’y a rien à redire.","Hey! what picture could we present to you, gentlemen; what spectacle could be put before your eyes, ladies, surer of your suffrage than the faithful representation of yourselves? The picture I am talking about is a mirror, and no one, until now, has thought of criticizing it; it is, for all those who look at it, a perfect picture to which there is nothing to complain about.","And what picture could be presented to you, gentlemen; what spectacle, ladies, could be placed before your eyes more certain of gaining your approval than the faithful portraiture of yourselves? The picture of which I speak is a mirror, and no one has as yet ventured to criticise it. It is to all who look on it a perfect picture, in depreciation of which not a word can be said.","Well, what image could one present to you, Gentlemen, what spectacle could one place before your eyes, Ladies , that would be more certain to win your approval than a faithful representation of yourselves? The image of which I speak is a mirror’s reflection, and as yet nobody has ever dared criticize it. It is, for all those who look at it, a perfect image to which none can take exception."
"Je ne sais pas trop, dans ce moment, ce qu’on pourrait répondre à cette observation, à laquelle je ne m’attendais pas en commençant ce chapitre.","I do not really know, at this moment, what one could answer to this observation, which I did not expect when starting this chapter.","I hardly know at this moment how one could reply to this observation, which I did not foresee when I began my chapter.","I have little idea, at present, how one might respond to this observation, which I hardly expected when beginning this chapter."
"Il y a tant de personnes curieuses dans le monde ! – Je suis persuadé qu’on voudrait savoir pourquoi mon voyage autour de ma chambre a duré quarante-deux jours au lieu de quarante-trois, ou de tout autre espace de temps ; mais comment l’apprendrais-je au lecteur, puisque je l’ignore moi-même ? Tout ce que je puis assurer, c’est que, si l’ouvrage est trop long à son gré, il n’a pas dépendu de moi de le rendre plus court ; toute vanité de voyageur à part, je me serais contenté d’un chapitre. J’étais, il est vrai dans ma chambre, avec tout le plaisir et l’agrément possibles ; mais, hélas ! je n’étais pas le maître d’en sortir à ma volonté ; je crois même que sans l’entremise de certaines personnes puissantes qui s’intéressaient à moi, et pour lesquelles ma reconnaissance n’est pas éteinte, j’aurais eu tout le temps de mettre un in-folio au jour, tant les protecteurs qui me faisaient voyager dans ma chambre étaient disposés en ma faveur !","There are so many curious people in the world! “I am sure people would like to know why my journey around my room lasted forty-two days instead of forty-three, or any other space of time; but how should I inform the reader of this, since I am ignorant of it myself? All I can assure is that, if the work is too long for his taste, it was not up to me to make it shorter; all traveler's vanity aside, I would have contented myself with a chapter. I was, it is true, in my room, with all possible pleasure and comfort; but unfortunately ! I was not free to leave it at my will; I even believe that without the intervention of certain powerful people who were interested in me, and for whom my gratitude is not extinguished, I would have had plenty of time to bring a folio to light, both the protectors who made me travel to my room were arranged in my favour!","HOW many inquisitive people there are in the world! I am sure my reader wants to know why the journey round my room has lasted forty-two days rather than forty-three, or any other number. But how am I to tell him what I do not know myself? All I can say is, that if the work is too long for him, it is not my fault that it was not shorter. I dismiss all the pride a traveller may fairly indulge in, and candidly declare I should have been well contented, for my part, with a single chapter. It is quite true that I made myself as comfortable as possible in my room; but still, alas, I was not my own master in the matter of leaving it. Nay, more, I even think that had it not been for the intervention of certain powerful persons who interested themselves in me, and towards whom I entertain a lively sense of gratitude, I should have had ample time for producing a folio volume; so prejudiced in my favor were the guardians who made me travel round my room.","There are so many curious people in this world.—I am convinced that some would like to know why my voyage around my room lasted forty-two days instead of forty-three or some other length of time. But how can I impart this to the reader, if I myself do not know? All I can say with any assurance is that if this work is too long for his liking, it was not within my power to shorten it: a traveler’s vanity notwithstanding, I would have been content with a single chapter. I was, it is true, quite pleased and amused to stay in my room; but I was not, alas, free to come out at will. Indeed, I believe that without the intervention of certain powerful persons interested in my case, and for whom my gratitude is most keen, I should have had all the time I needed to bring out an in-folio volume, so disposed in my favor were the protectors who sent me on my voyage around my room."
"Voici, je l’avoue, une des occasions où j’ai eu le plus à me plaindre de mon âme ; car, au lieu d’être fâchée de l’absence qu’elle venait de faire, et de tancer sa compagne sur sa précipitation, elle s’oublia au point de partager le ressentiment le plus animal, et de maltraiter de paroles ce pauvre innocent. Fainéant, allez travailler lui dit-elle (apostrophe exécrable, inventée par l’avare et cruelle richesse !) « Monsieur, dit-il alors, pour m’attendrir, je suis de Chambéry… – Tant pis pour vous. – Je suis Jacques ; c’est moi que vous avez vu à la campagne ; c’est moi qui menais les moutons aux champs… – Que venez-vous faire ici ? » Mon âme commençait à se repentir de la brutalité de mes premières paroles. – Je crois même qu’elle s’en était repentie un instant avant de les laisser échapper. C’est ainsi que, lorsqu’on rencontre inopinément dans sa course un fossé ou un bourbier, on le voit, mais on n’a pas le temps de l’éviter.","This, I confess, is one of the occasions when I have had the most reason to complain of my soul; for, instead of being sorry for the absence she had just made, and of scolding her companion for her haste, she forgot herself to the point of sharing the most animal resentment, and of mistreating this poor innocent with words. . Lazy, go to work she said to him (execrable apostrophe, invented by the miser and cruel wealth!) “Sir, he said then, to soften me, I am from Chambéry… – Too bad for you. – I am Jack; it was I you saw in the country; I was the one leading the sheep to the fields… – What are you doing here? My soul began to repent of the brutality of my first words. “I even believe that she had repented of it for a moment before she let them slip away. Thus, when one unexpectedly encounters a ditch or a quagmire in one's course, one sees it, but one does not have time to avoid it.","This was, I must own, one of the occasions upon which I had most to complain of my soul. For instead of being vexed at herself for having been absent, and scolding her companion for its hurry, she so far forgot herself as to give way to the most animal resentment, and to insult the poor fellow cruelly. “Idle rascal,” she said, “go and work.” (An execrable apostrophe this, the invention of miserly, heartless Mammon.) “Sir,” replied the man, hoping to soften my heart, “I come from Chambéry.” “So much the worse for you.” “I am James. You saw me when you were in the country. I used to drive the sheep into the fields.” “And what do you do here?” My soul began to regret the harshness of my first words; I almost think she regretted them a moment before they were uttered. In like manner, when one meets in the road a rut or puddle, one sees it, but has not time to avoid it.","This, I must admit, is one of those occasions where my greatest complaint is with my soul; for instead of getting angry at her own momentary truancy and scolding her companion for his reckless haste, she so forgot herself that she partook of a most animal resentment and abused, with words, that poor innocent at the door. “Good-for-nothing!” she shouted at him. (An abominable reproach, invented by avaricious, cruel wealth!)—“Monsieur,” he said, to move me to pity, “I am from Chambéry. ”—“Too bad for you. ”—“My name is Jacques; I’m the man you saw in the country;—it was I who was taking the sheep to pasture. ”—“What are you doing here?”—My soul was beginning to regret the brutality of her initial words.—I even think she regretted them an instant before blurting them out. As when suddenly coming upon a ditch or a mudhole along the road, one may see it, but one hasn’t enough time to avoid it."
"Enfin, lorsque j’ai épuisé toutes mes ressources, il s’avance au milieu de la chambre, et se plante là, les bras croisés, dans la plus parfaite immobilité.","Finally, when I have exhausted all my resources, he walks into the middle of the room and stands there, his arms crossed, in the most perfect immobility.","At last, when I have exhausted all my resources, he advances to the middle of the room, and with folded arms, plants himself there in a perfectly immovable position.","When, at last, I have exhausted all my expedients, he advances to the center of the room and plants himself there, arms crossed, without moving."
"Il ne faut pas anticiper sur les événements ; l’empressement de communiquer au lecteur mon système de l’âme et de la bête m’a fait abandonner la description de mon lit plus tôt que je ne devais ; lorsque je l’aurai terminée, je reprendrai mon voyage à l’endroit où je l’ai interrompu dans le chapitre précédent. – Je vous prie seulement de vous ressouvenir que nous avons laissé la moitié de moi-même, tenant le portrait de Mme de Hautcastel, tout près de la muraille, à quatre pas de mon bureau. J’avais oublié, en parlant de mon lit, de conseiller à tout homme qui le pourra d’avoir un lit de couleur rose et blanc : il est certain que les couleurs influent sur nous au point de nous égayer ou de nous attrister suivant leurs nuances. – Le rose et le blanc sont deux couleurs consacrées au plaisir et à la félicité. – La nature, en les donnant à la rose, lui a donné la couronne de l’empire de Flore ; et lorsque le ciel veut annoncer une belle journée au monde, il colore les nues de cette teinte charmante au lever du soleil.","We must not anticipate events; the eagerness to communicate to the reader my system of the soul and the beast made me abandon the description of my bed sooner than I should; when I have finished it, I will resume my journey where I left off in the previous chapter. “I only beg you to remember that we left half of me, holding the portrait of Madame de Hautcastel, very close to the wall, four paces from my office. I had forgotten, speaking of my bed, to advise any man who can to have a pink and white bed: it is certain that the colors influence us to the point of making us happy or saddening us according to their shades. – Pink and white are two colors dedicated to pleasure and bliss. – Nature, by giving them to the rose, gave her the crown of the empire of Flora; and when the sky wants to announce a beautiful day to the world, it colors the clouds with this charming hue at sunrise.","BUT we must not anticipate events. My hurry to communicate to the reader my system of the soul and animal caused me to abandon the description of my bed earlier than I ought to have done. When I have completed this description, I will continue my journey where I interrupted it in the last chapter. But let me pray you to bear in mind that we left one half of my ego four steps from my bureau, close to the wall, and holding the portrait of Madame de Hautcastel. In speaking of my bed, I forgot to recommend every man to have, if possible, a bed with rose and white furniture. There can be no doubt that colors so far affect us as to make us cheerful or sad, according to their hues. Now, rose and white are two colors that are consecrated to pleasure. Nature in bestowing them upon the rose has given her the crown of Flora’s realm. And when the sky would announce to the world a fine day, it paints the clouds at sunrise with this charming tint.","I must not get ahead of myself: in my eagerness to communicate to the reader my system of the soul and the beast, I left off the description of my bed sooner than I ought to have done; once I have taken care of that, I shall resume my voyage at the very place where I interrupted it in the preceding chapter.—I ask you only to remember that we left half of me holding the portrait of Mme de Hautcastel very close to the wall, a few steps from my desk; I had forgotten, when talking about my bed, to advise every man who can to have a pink and white bed; there is no question but that colors have an influence on our moods, and may cheer us up or sadden us depending on their shades.—Pink and white are two colors given to pleasure and happiness.—In assigning them to the rose, nature gave it the crown of the realm of Flora.—And when the heavens wish to announce to the world the coming of a beautiful day, they color the clouds with that lovely hue at sunrise."
"En prenant le miroir pour ce qu’il est, j’espère que personne ne me blâmera de l’avoir placé au-dessus de tous les tableaux de l’École d’Italie. Les dames, dont le goût ne saurait être faux, et dont la décision doit tout régler, jettent ordinairement leur premier coup d’œil sur ce tableau lorsqu’elles entrent dans un appartement.","Taking the mirror for what it is, I hope no one will blame me for having placed it above all the paintings of the School of Italy. The ladies, whose taste cannot be wrong, and whose decision must regulate everything, usually cast their first glance at this picture when they enter an apartment.","Taking the mirror as we find it, I hope no one will blame me for ranking it above all the pictures of the Italian school. Ladies, whose taste cannot be faulty, and whose opinion should decide the question, generally upon entering a room let their first glance fall upon this picture.","In seeing the mirror for what it is, I hope nobody will blame me for having ranked it above all the paintings of the Italian school.

"Non, mon ami n’est point entré dans le néant ; quelle que soit la barrière qui nous sépare, je le reverrai. – Ce n’est point sur un syllogisme que je fonde mes espérances. – Le vol d’un insecte qui traverse les airs suffit pour me persuader ; et souvent l’aspect de la campagne, le parfum des airs, et je ne sais quel charme répandu autour de moi, élèvent tellement mes pensées, qu’une preuve invincible de l’immortalité entre avec violence dans mon âme et l’occupe tout entière.","No, my friend has not entered into nothingness; whatever barrier separates us, I will see him again. – It is not on a syllogism that I base my hopes. – The flight of an insect which crosses the air suffices to persuade me; and often the aspect of the countryside, the perfume of the air, and I do not know what charm diffused around me, so elevate my thoughts, that an invincible proof of immortality enters violently into my soul and occupies it all. whole.","No! My friend is not annihilated. Whatever may be the barrier that separates us, I shall see him again. My hopes are based on no mere syllogism. The flight of an insect suffices to persuade me. And often the prospect of the surrounding country, the perfume of the air, and an indescribable charm which is spread around me, so raise my thoughts, that an invincible proof of immortality forces itself upon my soul, and fills it to the full. XXII.","No, my friend did not pass into nothingness; no matter what barrier may separate us, I will see him again.—But it’s not on a syllogism that I base my hopes.—The flight of an insect through the air is enough to convince me; and often the sight of the countryside, the sweet scent of the wind, and I know not what spell inhabiting the air about me, raise my thoughts so high that irrefutable proof of immortality forcefully enters my soul and fills it wholly. CHAPTER XXII"
"Tandis que mon âme fait ces observations, sa compagne, en fixant un œil attentif sur la figure ravissante de cette funeste beauté, se sent toute prête à lui pardonner la mort de Raphaël.","While my soul makes these observations, her companion, fixing an attentive eye on the ravishing face of this fatal beauty, feels quite ready to forgive her the death of Raphael.","While my soul makes these observations, her companion, whose eyes are attentively fixed upon the lovely face of that fatal beauty, feels quite ready to forgive her the death of Raphael.","As my soul was making these observations, her companion, casting an attentive eye upon the ravishing face of that deadly beauty, felt quite ready to forgive her for the death of Raphael."
"Je ne sais comment cela m’arrive ; depuis quelque temps mes chapitres finissent toujours sur un ton sinistre. En vain je fixe en les commençant mes regards sur quelque objet agréable, – en vain je m’embarque par le calme, j’essuie bientôt une bourrasque qui me fait dériver. – Pour mettre fin à cette agitation, qui ne me laisse pas le maître de mes idées, et pour apaiser les battements de mon cœur, que tant d’images attendrissantes ont trop agité, je ne vois d’autre remède qu’une dissertation. – Oui, je veux mettre ce morceau de glace sur mon cœur.","I don't know how it happens to me; for some time now my chapters have always ended in a sinister tone. In vain do I fix my gaze on beginning them on some agreeable object – in vain do I embark calmly, I soon experience a squall which makes me drift. – To put an end to this agitation, which does not leave me the master of my ideas, and to calm the beating of my heart, which so many touching images have agitated too much, I see no other remedy than a dissertation. – Yes, I want to put this piece of ice on my heart.","Painting and Music. I DO not know how it is, but of late my chapters have always ended in a mournful strain. In vain do I begin by fixing my eyes on some agreeable object; in vain do I embark when all is calm: a sudden gale soon drifts me away. To put an end to an agitation which deprives me of the mastery of my ideas, and to quiet the beating of a heart too much disturbed by so many touching images, I see no remedy but a dissertation. Yes, thus will I steel my heart.","I do not know how it happens, but for some time now my chapters all end on an ominous note. In vain I fix my gaze, at the start of each, on some agreeable object;—in vain I set sail in calm waters, only to meet with a squall which sets me adrift.—To put an end to these disturbances, which leave me unable to master my thoughts, and to pacify my racing heart, which so many touching images have overly excited , I see no other remedy than to give a disquisition.—Yes, I wish to put such a block of ice on my heart."

"« Mais apprenez-nous, dit-elle, pourquoi les femmes d’aujourd’hui semblent plutôt avoir des habillements pour se cacher que pour se vêtir : à peine laissent-elles apercevoir leur visage, auquel seul on peut reconnaître leur sexe, tant les formes de leur corps sont défigurées par les plis bizarres des étoffes ! De toutes les figures qui sont représentées dans ces feuilles, aucune ne laisse à découvert la gorge, les bras et les jambes : comment vos jeunes guerriers n’ont-ils pas tenté de détruire de semblables costumes ? Apparemment, ajouta-t-elle, la vertu des femmes d’aujourd’hui, qui se montre dans tous leurs habillements, surpasse de beaucoup celle de mes contemporaines ? » En finissant ces mots, Aspasie me regardait et semblait me demander une réponse. – Je feignis de ne pas m’en apercevoir ; – et pour me donner un air de distinction, je poussai sur la braise, avec des pincettes, les restes de la perruque du docteur qui avaient échappé à l’incendie. – M’apercevant ensuite qu’une des bandelettes qui serraient le brodequin d’Aspasie était dénouée : « Permettez, lui dis-je, charmante personne » et, en parlant ainsi, je me baissai vivement, portant les mains vers la chaise où je croyais voir ces deux jambes qui firent jadis extravaguer de grands philosophes.","""But teach us,"" she said, ""why today's women seem to wear clothes for hiding rather than for dressing themselves: they barely allow their faces to be seen, by which only one can recognize their sex, so much the the shapes of their bodies are disfigured by the bizarre folds of the fabrics! Of all the figures which are represented in these sheets, none leaves the throat, the arms and the legs uncovered: how did your young warriors not try to destroy similar costumes? Apparently, she added, the virtue of women today, which shows itself in all their dress, far surpasses that of my contemporaries? As she finished these words, Aspasie looked at me and seemed to ask me for an answer. “I pretended not to notice it; – and to give myself an air of distinction, I pushed on the embers, with tweezers, the remains of the doctor's wig which had escaped the fire. – Then noticing that one of the bandages which tightened Aspasie's boot was undone: ""Allow me, I said to her, charming person"" and, while speaking thus, I bent down quickly, putting my hands towards the chair where I I thought I saw those two legs that once made great philosophers extravagant.","“But do explain,” she said, “why women of the present day seem to wear dresses to hide rather than to clothe them. They scarcely allow their faces to be seen, those faces by which alone their sex is to be guessed, so strangely are their bodies disfigured by the eccentric folds of their garments. Among all the figures represented in these pages, I do not find one with the neck, arms, and legs bare. How is it your young warriors are not tempted to put an end to such a fashion? It would appear,” she added, “that the virtue of the women of this age, which they parade in all their articles of dress, greatly surpasses that of my contemporaries.” As she ended these words, Aspasia turned her eyes on me as if to ask a reply. I pretended not to notice this, and in order to give myself an absent air, took up the tongs and pushed away among the embers the shreds of the doctor’s wig which had escaped the flames. Observing presently afterwards that one of the bandelets which clasped Aspasia’s buskin had come undone, “Permit me,” said I, “charming lady,”—and eagerly stooping, stretched out my hands towards the chair on which I had fancied I saw those legs about which even great philosophers went into ecstacies.","“But tell us,” she said, “why do today’s women seem to wear clothes to hide themselves rather than to dress themselves? They hardly even show their faces, though that is the sole means whereby one might tell their sex, so misshapen are their figures by the bizarre pleats of the fabrics they wear. Of all the fashions presented in these pages, not one leaves the throat, arms, or legs uncovered: why have your young warriors not attempted to destroy such a custom? Apparently,” she added, “the virtue of today’s women, which can be seen in all their clothing, is far greater than that of my contemporaries. ”—In finishing this statement, Aspasia looked at me as if expecting a reply.—I pretended not to notice;—and to give the appearance of distraction, I took the tongs and pushed the remainder of the doctor’s wig, which had escaped the fire, onto the hot embers.—Then I noticed, however, that one of the thongs fastening Aspasia’s buskin had come untied. “My lovely lady,” I said, “please allow me”—and so saying, I bent down briskly, bringing my hands to the chair where I truly believed I was seeing the legs that long ago had made great philosophers rave."

"J’ai promis un dialogue, je tiens parole. – C’était le matin à l’aube du jour : les rayons du soleil doraient à la fois le sommet du mont Viso et celui des montagnes les plus élevées de l’île qui est à nos antipodes ; et déjà elle était éveillée, soit que son réveil prématuré fût l’effet des visions nocturnes qui la mettent souvent dans une agitation aussi fatigante qu’inutile, soit que le carnaval, qui tirait alors vers sa fin, fût la cause occulte de son réveil, ce temps de plaisir et de folie ayant une influence sur la machine humaine comme les phases de la lune et de la conjonction de certaines planètes. – Enfin, elle était éveillée et très éveillée, lorsque mon âme se débarrassa elle-même des liens du sommeil.","I promised a dialogue, I keep my word. – It was morning at daybreak: the rays of the sun gilded both the summit of Mount Viso and that of the highest mountains of the island which is at our antipodes; and she was already awake, either because her premature awakening was the effect of the nocturnal visions which often put her in an agitation as tiring as it was useless, or because the carnival, which was then drawing towards its end, was the occult cause of her awakening. , this time of pleasure and madness having an influence on the human machine like the phases of the moon and the conjunction of certain planets. “Finally, she was awake, and wide awake, when my soul rid itself of the bonds of sleep.","A Dialogue. I PROMISED a dialogue, and I will keep my word. It was daybreak. The rays of the sun were gilding the summit of Mount Viso, and the tops of the highest hills on the island beneath our feet. My soul was already awake. This early awakening may have been the effect of those night visions which often excite in her a fatiguing and useless agitation: or perhaps the carnival, then drawing to a close, was the secret cause; for this season of pleasure and folly influences the human organization much as do the phases of the moon and the conjunction of certain planets. However this may be, my soul was awake, and wide awake, when she shook off the bands of sleep.","I promised a dialogue, and I will keep my word.—One morning, at daybreak, as the sun’s rays were gilding the peaks of Mount Viso and of the highest mountains of the island at our antipodes,* he was already awake, having been prematurely roused either by the nocturnal visions that often put him in an agitated state as fatiguing as it is useless, or by the carnival that was then drawing to a close—this time of pleasure and folly having an influence on the human organism comparable to that of phases of the moon and the conjunction of certain planets.—In short, he was awake, quite awake, in fact, when my soul also decided to shake off the bonds of sleep."
"Messieurs et mesdames, soyez fiers de votre intelligence tant qu’il vous plaira ; mais défiez-vous beaucoup de l’autre surtout quand vous êtes ensemble !","Gentlemen and ladies, be proud of your intelligence as long as you please; but be very suspicious of each other, especially when you are together!","Ladies and gentlemen! Be as proud of your intellect as you please, but be very suspicious of the OTHER, especially when you are together.","Ladies and Gentlemen, be as proud of your intelligence as you please, but beware of that other—especially when you are together."
"Je finis par perdre patience, et, ne pouvant plus résister au dépit qui me dévorait, je posai le miroir que je tenais à la main, et je sortis d’un air de colère, et sans prendre congé.","I ended by losing patience, and, no longer able to resist the spite that was devouring me, I put down the mirror which I held in my hand, and I left with an air of anger, and without taking my leave.","In a word, I must confess that my rose and I cut a very poor figure. At last I lost all patience, and unable longer to control the vexation that preyed upon me, I put down the looking-glass I had been holding, and went out angrily without taking leave.","In short, shall I say it?—we were a sorry sight, my rose and I. In the end I lost patience and, unable any longer to resist the resentment eating away at me, I set down the mirror and exited angrily, without saying goodbye."
"Le docteur Cigna sourit ; et, comme les esprits ne sauraient se refuser à l’évidence ni taire la vérité, non seulement il fut de l’avis d’Hippocrate, mais il avoua même, en rougissant à la manière des intelligences, qu’il s’en était toujours douté.","Doctor Cigna smiled; and, as minds cannot deny themselves the evidence or conceal the truth, not only did he agree with Hippocrates, but he even confessed, blushing like intelligences, that he was wrong. always doubted.","Doctor Cigna smiled; and as spirits can neither withstand evidence, nor silence truth, he not only agreed with Hippocrates, but, blushing after the manner of disembodied intelligences, he protested that he had himself always had his doubts.","Doctor Cigna smiled. And as ghosts could never turn a blind eye to the facts, nor silence the truth, not only did he agree with Hippocrates, but he actually confessed, blushing the way spirits blush, that he had always suspected it was so."
"Mais, permettez-moi de vous le demander, messieurs, vous amusez-vous autant qu’autrefois au bal et à la comédie ? Pour moi, je vous l’avoue, depuis quelque temps, toutes les assemblées nombreuses m’inspirent une certaine terreur. – J’y suis assailli par un songe sinistre. – En vain je fais mes efforts pour le chasser, il revient toujours, comme celui d’Athalie. – C’est peut-être parce que l’âme, inondée aujourd’hui d’idées noires et de tableaux déchirants, trouve partout des sujets de tristesse – comme un estomac vicié convertit en poisons les aliments les plus sains. Quoi qu’il en soit, voici mon songe : – Lorsque je suis dans une de ces fêtes, au milieu de cette foule d’hommes aimables et caressants qui dansent, qui chantent, – qui pleurent aux tragédies, qui n’expriment que la joie, la franchise et la cordialité, je me dis : – Si dans cette assemblée polie il entrait tout à coup un ours blanc, un philosophe, un tigre, ou quelque autre animal de cette espèce, et que, montant à l’orchestre, il s’écriât d’une voix forcenée : – « Malheureux humains ! écoutez la vérité qui vous parle par ma bouche : vous êtes opprimés, tyrannisés ; vous êtes malheureux ; vous vous ennuyez. – Sortez de cette léthargie !","But, allow me to ask you, gentlemen, do you enjoy the ball and the comedy as much as you used to? As for me, I confess to you, for some time now, all large assemblies have inspired a certain terror in me. – I am assailed by a sinister dream. – In vain do I try to chase it away, it always comes back, like Athalie’s. – It is perhaps because the soul, inundated today with dark thoughts and heartrending pictures, finds subjects of sadness everywhere – as a stale stomach converts the healthiest foods into poisons. Be that as it may, here is my dream: – When I am at one of these parties, in the midst of this crowd of pleasant and caressing men who dance, who sing, – who cry at tragedies, who express only the joy, frankness and cordiality, I said to myself: – If in this polite assembly there suddenly entered a white bear, a philosopher, a tiger, or some other animal of this species, and that, going up to the orchestra, he exclaimed in a frenzied voice: “Unfortunate humans! listen to the truth that speaks to you through my mouth: you are oppressed, tyrannized; you are unhappy; you're bored. – Get out of this lethargy!","Misanthropy. BUT, gentlemen, allow me to ask a question. Do you enjoy balls and plays as much as you used to do? As for me, I avow that for some time past crowded assemblies have inspired me with a kind of terror. When in their midst, I am assailed by an ominous dream. In vain I try to shake it off; like the dream of Athalie, it constantly returns. Perhaps this is because the soul, overwhelmed at the present moment by dark fancies and painful pictures, sees nothing but sadness around it, just as a disordered stomach turns the most wholesome food into poison. However this may be, my dream is as follows. When I am at one of these fêtes, among a crowd of kind, good-natured men, who dance and sing, who weep at tragedies, and are full of frankness and cordiality, I say to myself:— “If suddenly a white bear, a philosopher, a tiger, or some other animal of this kind were to enter, and ascending to the orchestra, were to shout out furiously: ‘Wretched beings! Listen to the truth that comes from my lips! You are oppressed! You are the slaves of tyrants! You are wretched and heart-sick! Awake from your lethargy!","But allow me, Gentlemen, to ask you a question: Do you enjoy yourselves as much as you used to at a ball or at the theatre?—For my part, I must say that for some time now, any large gathering of people inspires a kind of terror in me.—I am, in such circumstances, assailed by a sinister dream.—Try as I might to banish it from my mind, it always comes back, like Athaliah’s dream. * This is perhaps because the soul, now inundated with so many dark ideas and heartrending spectacles, everywhere finds causes for sorrow;—like a tainted stomach that turns even the most wholesome foods to poison.—Be that as it may, my dream is as follows: When I am at one of those balls, amidst that crowd of amiable, handsome people dancing and singing—people who weep at tragedies, who express only joy, candor, and cordiality—I say to myself:—What if suddenly a white bear, a philosopher, a tiger, or some other animal of that sort were to join this polite gathering, go up to the orchestra, and shout out madly: “Wretched humans! Harken to the truth that speaks through me: you are oppressed and tyrannized; you are unhappy; you are bored.—Rouse yourselves from your sleep."
"Le soir, lorsqu’elle a été grondée, elle se retire tristement et sans murmurer : le lendemain, à la pointe du jour, elle est auprès de mon lit, dans une attitude respectueuse ; et, au moindre mouvement de son maître, au moindre signe de réveil, elle annonce sa présence par les battements précipités de sa queue sur ma table de nuit.","In the evening, when she has been scolded, she retires sadly and without a murmur: the next day, at daybreak, she is by my bed, in a respectful attitude; and, at the slightest movement of her master, at the slightest sign of awakening, she announces her presence by the hasty beats of her tail on my bedside table.","In the evening, if she has been scolded she withdraws sadly and without a murmur. The next morning at daybreak, she stands near my bed in a respectful attitude, and at her master’s slightest movement, at the first sign of his being awake, she makes her presence known by rapidly tapping my little table with her tail.","In the evening, when she has been scolded, she retires gloomily and without a sound; the following day, at sunrise, she is at my bedside in an attitude of respect, and at the slightest movement from her master, at the first sign of waking, she announces her presence with the rapid thumping of her tail against my night table."
"J’ai voulu dire quelque chose de ces malheureux dans mon voyage, parce que l’idée de leur misère est souvent venue me distraire en chemin. Quelquefois, frappé de la différence de leur situation et de la mienne, j’arrêtais tout à coup ma berline, et ma chambre me paraissait prodigieusement embellie. Quel luxe inutile ! Six chaises, deux tables, un bureau, un miroir, quelle ostentation ! Mon lit surtout, mon lit couleur de rose et blanc, et mes deux matelas, me semblaient défier la magnificence et la mollesse des monarques de l’Asie. – Ces réflexions me rendaient indifférents les plaisirs qu’on m’avait défendus ; et, de réflexions en réflexions, mon accès de philosophie devenait tel que j’aurais entendu le son des violons et des clarinettes sans remuer de ma place – j’aurais entendu de mes deux oreilles la voix mélodieuse de Marchesini, cette voix qui m’a si souvent mis hors de moi-même, – oui, je l’aurais entendue sans m’ébranler ; – bien plus, j’aurais regardé sans la moindre émotion la plus belle femme de Turin, Eugénie elle-même, parée de la tête aux pieds par les mains de mademoiselle Rapous. – Cela n’est cependant pas bien sûr.","I wanted to say something about these unfortunates on my journey, because the idea of their misery has often distracted me on the way. Sometimes, struck by the difference between their situation and mine, I suddenly stopped my carriage, and my room seemed to me prodigiously embellished. What unnecessary luxury! Six chairs, two tables, a desk, a mirror, what ostentation! My bed especially, my pink and white bed, and my two mattresses, seemed to defy the magnificence and softness of the monarchs of Asia. “These reflections made me indifferent to the pleasures that I had been forbidden; and, from reflection to reflection, my access to philosophy became such that I would have heard the sound of violins and clarinets without moving from my place – I would have heard with my two ears the melodious voice of Marchesini, this voice that so often pissed me off – yes, I would have heard it without flinching; – even more, I would have looked without the slightest emotion at the most beautiful woman in Turin, Eugenie herself, adorned from head to foot by the hands of Mademoiselle Rapous. – However, that is not certain.","I COULD not help saying a word in my journey about those poor creatures, for the thought of them has often come across me on my way, and turned the current of my reflections. Sometimes, struck with the difference between their case and my own, I have suddenly stopped my travelling-carriage, and thought my chamber extravagantly embellished! What superfluous luxury! Six chairs, two tables, a bureau, and a looking-glass! What vain display! My bed above all things, my rose and white bed, with its two mattresses, seemed to rival the magnificence and effeminacy of Asiatic monarchs. These meditations made me indifferent to the pleasures that had been forbidden me. And, as I went on from one reflection to another, my fit of philosophy became so serious that I could have seen a ball going on in the next room, and heard the sound of violins and flutes without stirring. I could have heard Marchesini’s melodious voice, that voice which has so often transported me, yes, I could have listened to it without being moved. Nay, more, I could have gazed upon the most beauteous woman in Turin, upon Eugénie herself, adorned from head to foot by the hands of Mademoiselle Rapoux,[4] without emotion. But, of this last, I must confess myself not quite sure.","I wanted to say something about those unfortunate people during my voyage, because the thought of their misery has often distracted me along the road. Several times, struck by the difference between their situation and my own, I have stopped my coach at once, and my room has suddenly seemed prodigiously lavish. What useless luxury! Six chairs, two tables, a writing desk, a mirror! What ostentation! My bed especially: my pink-and-white bed, with its two mattresses, seemed to outdo the monarchs of the East in magnificence and voluptuousness.—Such reflections made me indifferent to the pleasures that had been forbidden me. And after reflection upon reflection, my outburst of philosophy became so great that, had I seen a ball in the neighboring room , had I heard the sounds of violins and clarinets, I should not have stirred from my place;—I could have heard with my own ears the melodious voice of Marchesini, a voice that has often transported me outside myself, and still I should not have moved;—even more than this, I could have gazed upon the most beautiful woman in Turin, Eugénie herself, decked out from head to toe by Mme Repous,* and felt nothing at all.—That, however, is not a good thing."
"Or, puisque les miroirs communs annoncent en vain la vérité, et que chacun est content de sa figure ; puisqu’ils ne peuvent faire connaître aux hommes leurs imperfections physiques, à quoi servirait un miroir moral ? Peu de monde y jetterait les yeux, et personne ne s’y reconnaîtrait, – excepté les philosophes. – J’en doute même un peu.","Now, since the common mirrors announce the truth in vain, and everyone is content with his face; since they cannot make known to men their physical imperfections, of what use would a moral mirror be? Few people would cast their eyes on it, and no one would recognize themselves in it – except the philosophers. - I even doubt it a bit.","Now, seeing that ordinary looking-glasses record the truth in vain, and that they cannot make men see their own imperfections, every one being satisfied with his face, what would a moral mirror avail? Few people would look at it, and no one would recognize himself. None save philosophers would spend their time in examining themselves,—I even have my doubts about the philosophers.","Now, since ordinary mirrors proclaim the truth in vain, and everyone remains pleased with his appearance,—since they fail to make people acknowledge their physical imperfections , what would be the use of a moral mirror? Few would cast so much as a glance at it, and none would recognize himself in it.—Philosophers alone would waste their time looking at themselves.—And I even have my doubts of that."

"J’étais assis près de mon feu, après dîner, plié dans mon habit de voyage, et livré volontairement à toute son influence, en attendant l’heure du départ, lorsque les vapeurs de la digestion, se portant à mon cerveau, obstruèrent tellement les passages par lesquels les idées s’y rendaient en venant des sens que toute communication se trouva interceptée ; et de même que mes sens ne transmettaient plus aucune idée à mon cerveau, celui-ci, à son tour, ne pouvait plus envoyer le fluide électrique qui les anime et avec lequel l’ingénieux docteur Valli ressuscite des grenouilles mortes.","I was seated by my fire after dinner, folded in my traveling clothes, and voluntarily given over to all its influence, awaiting the hour of departure, when the fumes of digestion, reaching my brain, obstructed so much the passages through which ideas traveled there from the senses that all communication was intercepted; and just as my senses no longer transmitted any idea to my brain, the latter, in its turn, could no longer send the electric fluid which animates them and with which the ingenious doctor Valli resurrects dead frogs.","I WAS sitting near my fire after dinner, enveloped in my “habit de voyage,” and freely abandoning myself to its influence: the hour for starting was, I knew, drawing nigh; but the fumes generated by digestion rose to my brain, and so obstructed the channels along which thoughts glide on their way from the senses, that all communication between them was intercepted.

See with what gravity it walks among men. The crowd falls back with respect, and believe me, none will remark that it is alone. The people among whom it walks care very little whether it has a soul or not, whether it thinks or not. A thousand sentimental women will fall desperately in love with it without discovering the defect. It may even raise itself without thy soul’s help to the highest favor and fortune. Nay, I should not be astonished if, on thy return from the empyrean, thy soul, on getting home, were to find itself in the animal of a noble lord.","Ah, but why does he not leave these miserable cares, the torment of ambition, to the other?—Come, unhappy wretch! Try to break out of your prison and, from the sky where I will take you, amidst the heavenly orbs and the empyrean, look down upon your beast cast into the world, as he beats the path of fortune and honor all alone; see how solemnly he walks among men: the rabble steps aside in respect. And take my word, none shall ever notice that he is alone; that is the least concern of the mob in whose midst he moves; little do they care whether or not he has a soul, whether or not he thinks.—Hundreds of passionate women will love him madly unawares; and he can even, without the aid of your soul, raise himself to the highest station, the pinnacle of success.—In short, I should not be at all surprised if, upon our return from the empyrean, your soul, in going back home, found herself inside the beast of a great lord."
"La chute de ma chaise de poste a rendu le service au lecteur de raccourcir mon voyage d’une bonne douzaine de chapitres, parce qu’en me relevant je me trouvai vis-à-vis et tout près de mon bureau, et que je ne fus plus à temps de faire des réflexions sur le nombre d’estampes et de tableaux que j’avais encore à parcourir, et qui auraient pu allonger mes excursions sur la peinture.","The fall from my post-chaise did the reader the service of shortening my journey by a good dozen chapters, because when I got up I found myself opposite and very close to my desk, and I I was more in time to reflect on the number of prints and paintings that I still had to go through, and which could have lengthened my excursions into painting.","THE upset of my post-chaise has rendered the reader the service of shortening my journey by a good dozen chapters, for, upon getting up, I found myself close to my bureau, and saw that I had no time left for any observations upon a number of engravings and pictures which had yet to be surveyed, and which might have lengthened my excursions into the realm of painting.","The fall from my post-chaise has done the reader the favor of shortening my voyage by a good dozen chapters, since while picking myself up I found myself right in front of my writing desk, having missed my chance to comment upon a number of prints and paintings still remaining to be examined, which might have prolonged my digressions on art."
"Quel riche trésor de jouissances la bonne nature a livré aux hommes dont le cœur sait jouir et quelle variété dans ces jouissances ! Qui pourra compter leurs nuances innombrables dans les divers individus et dans les différents âges de la vie ? Le souvenir confus de celles de mon enfance me font encore tressaillir. Essayerai-je de peindre celles qu’éprouve le jeune homme dont le cœur commence à brûler de tous les feux du sentiment ? Dans cet âge heureux où l’on ignore encore jusqu’au nom de l’intérêt, de l’ambition, de la haine et de toutes les passions honteuses qui dégradent et tourmentent l’humanité ; durant cet âge, hélas ! trop court, le soleil brille d’un éclat qu’on ne lui retrouve plus dans le reste de la vie. L’air est plus pur ; – les fontaines sont plus limpides et plus fraîches ; – la nature a des aspects, les bocages ont des sentiers qu’on ne retrouve plus dans l’âge mur. Dieu ! quels parfums envoient les fleurs ! que ces fruits sont délicieux ! de quelles couleurs se pare l’aurore ! – Toutes les femmes sont aimables et fidèles ; tous les hommes sont bons, généreux et sensibles : partout on rencontre la cordialité, la franchise et le désintéressement ; il n’existe dans la nature que des fleurs, des vertus et des plaisirs.","What a rich treasure of enjoyments good nature has delivered to men whose heart knows how to enjoy, and what variety in these enjoyments! Who will be able to count their innumerable shades in different individuals and at different ages of life? The confused memory of those of my childhood still make me shudder. Shall I try to paint those felt by the young man whose heart begins to burn with all the fires of feeling? In this happy age when we are still ignorant even of the name of self-interest, of ambition, of hatred and of all the shameful passions which degrade and torment humanity; during this age, alas! too short, the sun shines with a brilliance that we no longer find in the rest of life. The air is purer; – the fountains are clearer and cooler; – nature has aspects, the groves have paths that are no longer found in mature age. God ! what perfumes the flowers send out! These fruits are delicious! what colors the dawn is adorned with! – All women are kind and faithful; all men are good, generous and sensitive: everywhere one finds cordiality, frankness and disinterestedness; there are only flowers, virtues and pleasures in nature.","WHAT a wealth of delights has kind Nature given to those who can enjoy them. Who can count the innumerable phases they assume in different individuals, and at different periods of life! The confused remembrance of the pleasures of my boyhood sends a thrill through my heart. Shall I attempt to paint the joys of the youth whose soul glows with all the warmth of love, at an age when interest, ambition, hatred, and all the base passions that degrade and torment humanity are unknown to him, even by name? During this age, too short, alas! the sun shines with a brightness it never displays in after-life; the air is then purer, the streams clearer and fresher, and nature has aspects, and the woods have paths, which in our riper age we never find again. O, what perfumes those flowers breathe! How delicious are those fruits! With what colors is the morning sky adorned! Men are all good, generous, kind-hearted; and women all lovely and faithful. On all sides we meet with cordiality, frankness, and unselfishness. Nature presents to us nothing but flowers, virtues, and pleasures.","What a great wealth of delights good Mother Nature has bestowed upon people who in their hearts know how to enjoy life! And what variety in these delights! Who could ever count their innumerable shades of difference from one individual to the next, and in the different ages of life!—The blurred memory of those of my childhood still makes me quiver. Shall I attempt to describe those felt by a young man whose heart is beginning to burn with all the fires of sentiment?—At that happy age when one still knows nothing, not even the names, of self-interest, ambition, hatred, and all the shameful passions that debase and torment humanity; at that age—too brief, alas!—the sun shines with a brilliance that one will not see again for the rest of one’s life. The air is purer, the fountains fresher, more limpid;—nature has aspects, woodlands have paths that one no longer finds in later years. Heavens! what fragrances the flowers exude! how delicious the fruit is! what colors paint the dawn!—All women are lovely and faithful; and men are good, kind, and sensitive. One encounters cordiality, sincerity, and unselfishness at every turn: in nature there are only flowers, virtues, and pleasures."
"Si le lecteur réfléchit sur la conduite de mon domestique, il pourra se convaincre que, dans certaines affaires délicates, du genre de celle-ci, la simplicité et le bon sens valent infiniment mieux que l’esprit le plus adroit. J’ose assurer que le discours le plus étudié sur les inconvénients de la parole ne me déciderait pas à sortir aussi promptement de mon lit que le reproche muet de M. Joannetti.","If the reader reflects on the conduct of my servant, he will be able to convince himself that, in certain delicate matters, such as this, simplicity and common sense are infinitely better than the most skilful mind. I dare to assure you that the most studied discourse on the inconveniences of speech would not persuade me to get out of bed as quickly as the mute reproach of M. Joannetti.","If the reader will reflect upon the behavior of my servant, he will convince himself that in certain delicate matters of this kind, simplicity and good sense are much better than the sharpest wit. I dare assert that the most studied discourse on the impropriety of sloth would not make me spring so readily from my bed as the silent reproach of Monsieur Joannetti.","If the reader reflects a moment on my valet’s conduct, he will realize that, in certain delicate matters such as the one at hand, simplicity and common sense are of infinitely greater value than the cleverest mind. I assure you that the most elaborate speech on the disadvantages of laziness would never convince me to get out of my bed so promptly as does the mute disapproval of Monsieur Joanetti."

"J’espère avoir suffisamment développé mes idées dans les chapitres précédents pour donner à penser au lecteur, et pour le mettre à même de faire des découvertes dans cette brillante carrière ; il ne pourra qu’être satisfait de lui, s’il parvient un jour à savoir faire voyager son âme toute seule ; les plaisirs que cette faculté lui procurera balanceront du reste les quiproquo qui pourront en résulter. Est-il une jouissance plus flatteuse que celle d’étendre ainsi son existence, d’occuper à la fois la terre et les cieux, et de doubler, pour ainsi dire, son être ? – Le désir éternel et jamais satisfait de l’homme n’est-il pas d’augmenter sa puissance et ses facultés, de vouloir être où il n’est pas, de rappeler le passé et de vivre dans l’avenir ? – Il veut commander aux armées, présider aux académies ; il veut être adoré des belles, et, s’il possède tout cela, il regrette alors les champs et la tranquillité, et porte envie à la cabane des bergers : ses projets, ses espérances échouent sans cesse contre les malheurs réels attachés à la nature humaine ; il ne saurait trouver le bonheur. Un quart d’heure de voyage avec moi lui en montrera le chemin.","I hope I have sufficiently developed my ideas in the preceding chapters to give the reader thought, and to enable him to make discoveries in this brilliant career; he can only be satisfied with himself, if he manages one day to know how to make his soul travel alone; the pleasures that this faculty will procure for him will moreover balance the misunderstandings that may result from it. Is there a more flattering enjoyment than that of thus extending one's existence, of occupying both the earth and the heavens, and of doubling, so to speak, one's being? – Is not the eternal and never satisfied desire of man to increase his power and his faculties, to want to be where he is not, to remember the past and to live in the future? – He wants to command the armies, preside over the academies; he wants to be adored by the fair ones, and if he possesses all that, then he misses the fields and the tranquility, and is envious of the hut of the shepherds: his projects, his hopes constantly fail against the real misfortunes attached to nature. human; he cannot find happiness. A quarter of an hour of travel with me will show him the way.","I HOPE I have sufficiently developed my ideas in the foregoing chapters to furnish you, good reader, with matter for thought, and to enable you to make discoveries along the brilliant career before you. You cannot be other than highly satisfied with yourself if you succeed in the long run in making your soul travel alone. The pleasure afforded by this power will amply counterbalance any inconvenience that may arise from it. What more flattering delight is there than the being able thus to expand one’s existence, to occupy at once earth and heaven, to double, so to speak, one’s being? Is it not man’s eternal, insatiable desire to augment his strength and his faculties, to be where he is not, to recall the past, and live in the future? He would fain command armies, preside over learned societies, and be the idol of the fair. And, if he attain to all this, then he regrets the tranquillity of a rural life, and envies the shepherd’s cot. His plans, his hopes, are constantly foiled by the ills that flesh is heir to. He can find happiness nowhere. A quarter of an hour’s journey with me will show him the way to it.","I hope that in the preceding chapters I have set forth my ideas well enough to give the reader food for thought and enable him to make discoveries of his own in this luminous realm. He could not help but be pleased with himself should he succeed one day in making his soul travel all by herself; the delights that this ability will bring to him will more than outweigh the misunderstandings that might result from it. Indeed, could there be any joy more gratifying than that of thus stretching one’s existence, of inhabiting the earth and the heavens at once, of doubling, as it were, one ’s being?—Is it not man’s eternal and forever unfulfilled wish to increase his power and abilities, to be where he is not, to recall the past and to live in the future? He wants to command armies and preside over academies; he wants to be worshiped by beautiful women; yet if he has all this, he misses the calm of the countryside, and envies the shepherd his cabin. His plans and hopes are forever doomed to founder against the real sorrows inherent in human nature: he cannot find happiness.—A quarter of an hour’s travel with me will show him the way."
"Je n’ajouterai qu’un conseil pour vous, messieurs : c’est de vous mettre bien dans l’esprit qu’un jour de bal votre maîtresse n’est plus à vous.","I will only add one piece of advice for you, gentlemen: it is to bear in mind that one day at the ball your mistress is no longer yours.","I will only add, gentlemen, a word of counsel.

"S’il est utile et agréable d’avoir une âme dégagée de la matière au point de la faire voyager toute seule lorsqu’on le juge à propos, cette faculté a aussi ses inconvénients. C’est à elle, par exemple, que je dois la brûlure dont j’ai parlé dans les chapitres précédents. – Je donne ordinairement à ma bête le soin des apprêts de mon déjeuner ; c’est elle qui fait griller mon pain et le coupe en tranches. Elle fait à merveille le café, et le prend même très souvent sans que mon âme s’en mêle, à moins que celle-ci ne s’amuse à la voir travailler ; mais cela est rare et très difficile à exécuter : car il est aisé, lorsqu’on fait quelque opération mécanique, de penser à toute autre chose ; mais il est extrêmement difficile de se regarder agir, pour ainsi dire ; – ou, pour m’expliquer suivant mon système, d’employer son âme à examiner la marche de sa bête, et de la voir travailler sans y prendre part. – Voilà le plus étonnant tour de force métaphysique que l’homme puisse exécuter.","If it is useful and pleasant to have a soul freed from matter to the point of making it travel on its own when it is deemed appropriate, this faculty also has its drawbacks. It is to her, for example, that I owe the burning of which I have spoken in the preceding chapters. “I usually give my animal the care of preparing my breakfast; she is the one who toasts my bread and cuts it into slices. She makes coffee wonderfully, and even takes it very often without my soul getting involved, unless my soul enjoys watching her work; but this is rare and very difficult to perform: for it is easy, when performing some mechanical operation, to think of quite another thing; but it is extremely difficult to watch oneself act, so to speak; – or, to explain myself according to my system, to employ his soul to examine the progress of his animal, and to see it working without taking part in it. – This is the most astonishing metaphysical tour de force that man can perform.","The Animal. IF it is both useful and agreeable to have a soul so disengaged from matter that we can let it travel alone whenever we please, this has also its disadvantages. Through this, for instance, I got the burn I spoke of a few chapters back. I generally leave my animal to prepare my breakfast. Its care it is to slice and toast my bread. My coffee it makes admirably, and helps itself thereto without my soul’s concerning herself in the transaction. But this is a very rare and nice performance to execute; for though it is easy enough while busied in a mechanical operation, to think of something quite different, it is extremely difficult, so to speak, to watch one’s self-work, or, if I express myself systematically, to employ one’s soul to examine the animal’s progress, and to watch its work without taking part in it. This is the most extraordinary metaphysical feat a man can execute.","If it is useful and agreeable to have a soul so disengaged from matter that one can let her travel alone as one sees fit, this faculty also has its inconveniences. It was, for example, to blame for the burn I mentioned a few chapters back.—Customarily I leave to my beast the task of preparing my breakfast: he toasts and slices my bread, makes excellent coffee, and often drinks it without the participation of my soul, unless the latter wishes to amuse herself while watching the other work, but that happens rarely, and is very difficult to carry out; for it is easy, when one is performing a mechanical operation, to have one’s mind on something else entirely, but it is extremely difficult to watch oneself working, so to speak, or—to put it more clearly in terms of my system—to use one’s soul to observe the working of the beast without taking part.—For that is the most stunning metaphysical tour de force that man can perform."

"Je m’acheminais insensiblement à une dissertation sur la médecine et sur les progrès qu’elle a faits depuis Hippocrate. – Je me demandais si les personnages fameux de l’antiquité qui sont morts dans leur lit, comme Périclès, Platon, la célèbre Aspasie et Hippocrate lui-même, étaient morts comme des gens ordinaires, d’une fièvre putride, inflammatoire ou vermineuse ; si on les avait saignés et bourrés de remèdes.","I was heading imperceptibly towards a dissertation on medicine and the progress it has made since Hippocrates. – I wondered if the famous people of antiquity who died in their beds, like Pericles, Plato, the famous Aspasia and Hippocrates himself, had died like ordinary people, of a putrid, inflammatory or verminous fever; if they had been bled and stuffed with medicine.","I travelled insensibly to a dissertation on medicine and the progress it has made since the time of Hippocrates. I asked myself whether the famous personages of antiquity who died in their beds, as Pericles, Plato, the celebrated Aspasia, and Hippocrates, died, after the manner of ordinary mortals, of some putrid or inflammatory fever; and whether they were bled, and crammed with specifics.","I had embarked unawares on a disquisition on medicine and the advances it has made since Hippocrates.—I wondered whether the famous figures of antiquity who died in their beds, such as Pericles, Plato, the celebrated Aspasia, and Hippocrates himself, had died like ordinary people, of worms, inflammations, or putrid fever, and had been bled and plied with endless cures."
"Que de protestations, que d’offres de services ! Je pouvais compter sur leur fortune, sur une amitié éternelle et sans réserve !","What protests, what offers of services! I could count on their fortune, on an eternal and unreserved friendship!","And yet what protestations they made, what offers of assistance! Their purse was at my disposal, and they begged me to depend upon their eternal and entire friendship!","All those declarations, those offers of services! Oh, I could count on them, on their fortunes, on their eternal, unconditional friendship!"
"J’ai fait je ne sais combien d’expériences sur l’union de ces deux créatures hétérogènes. Par exemple, j’ai reconnu clairement que l’âme peut se faire obéir par la bête, et que, par un fâcheux retour, celle-ci oblige très souvent l’âme d’agir contre son gré. Dans les règles, l’une a le pouvoir législatif, et l’autre le pouvoir exécutif ; mais ces deux pouvoirs se contrarient souvent. – Le grand art d’un homme de génie est de savoir bien élever sa bête, afin qu’elle puisse aller seule, tandis que l’âme, délivrée de cette pénible accointance, peut s’élever jusqu’au ciel.","I have done I don't know how many experiments on the union of these two heterogeneous creatures. For example, I clearly recognized that the soul can make itself obeyed by the beast, and that, by an unfortunate return, the latter very often obliges the soul to act against its will. In the rules, one has the legislative power, and the other the executive power; but these two powers often contradict each other. – The great art of a man of genius is to know how to raise his animal well, so that it can go alone, while the soul, freed from this painful acquaintance, can rise to heaven.","I have experimented I know not how oft, upon the union of these two heterogeneous creatures. I have, for instance, clearly ascertained that the soul can make herself obeyed by the animal, and that, by way of retaliation, the animal makes the soul act contrary to its own inclination. The one, as a rule, has the legislative, the other the executive power, but these two are often at variance. The great business of a man of genius is to train his animal well, in order that it may go alone, while the soul, delivered from this troublesome companion, can raise herself to the skies.","I have conducted I know not how many experiments on the union of these two heterogeneous creatures. For example, I have clearly determined that the soul can command obedience from the beast, and that, by an unfortunate reciprocity, the latter can very often compel the soul to act against her will. According to the rules, the one has legislative power, the other executive power; but very often these powers oppose each other.—The great skill of a man of genius lies in knowing how to bring his beast up well, so that he may go his own way in the world while the soul, released from this distressing intimacy, raises herself to the heavens. *"
"Enfin, dans la classe des hommes parmi lesquels je vis, combien n’en est-il pas qui, se voyant parés d’un uniforme, se croient fermement officiers, – jusqu’au moment où l’apparition inattendue de l’ennemi les détrompe ? – Il y a plus : s’il plaît au roi de permettre à l’un d’eux d’ajouter à son habit une certaine broderie, voilà qu’il se croit un général, et toute l’armée lui donne ce titre, sans rire, tant l’influence de l’habit est forte sur l’imagination humaine.","Finally, in the class of men among whom I live, how many are there who, seeing themselves decked out in uniform, believe themselves firmly to be officers - until the moment when the unexpected appearance of the enemy correct? – There is more: if the king pleases to allow one of them to add a certain embroidery to his coat, he thinks himself a general, and the whole army gives him this title, without laughing, so strong is the influence of clothing on the human imagination.","And in the class of men among whom I live, how many there are who, finding themselves clothed in uniform, firmly believe they are officers, until the unexpected appearance of the enemy shows them their mistake. And more than this, if it be the king’s good pleasure to allow one of them to add to his coat a certain trimming, he straightway believes himself to be a general, and the whole army gives him the title without any notion of making fun of him! So great an influence has a coat upon the human imagination!","In short, among the class of men in whose midst I live, how many are there who, seeing themselves clad in a uniform, firmly believe themselves to be officers—until the sudden appearance of the enemy undeceives them?—Or worse still, if it pleases the king to allow one of them to add some embroidery to his dress, suddenly he thinks he’s a general, and the whole army also gives him this title without laughing,—so great is clothing’s influence on the human imagination."

"Lorsque les spacieuses et triples portes des Enfers s’ouvrirent tout à coup devant lui à deux battants, et que la profonde fosse du néant et de la nuit parut à ses pieds dans toute son horreur, – il parcourut d’un œil intrépide le sombre empire du chaos, et, sans hésiter, ouvrant ses larges ailes, qui auraient pu couvrir une armée entière, il se précipita dans l’abîme.","When the spacious triple gates of Hell suddenly opened double before him, and the deep pit of nothingness and night appeared at his feet in all its horror, - he looked fearlessly into the dark empire of chaos, and without hesitation, opening its wide wings, which could have covered an entire army, it rushed into the abyss.","When the thrice-threefold gates of hell fly open before him, and the dark, boundless ocean discloses itself in all its horror at his feet, with undaunted eye he surveys the realm of chaos, and then, opening his sail-broad wings, precipitates himself into the abyss.[10]","When the vast, threefold gates of hell flew open before him, and the pit of night and the void yawned in all its horror at his feet, he ran his intrepid eye over chaos’s dark empire and, without hesitation, spreading his tremendous wings, which could have covered a whole army, cast himself into the abyss."
"On concevra facilement, après avoir lu ce préambule, pourquoi ma tête tomba sur ma poitrine, et comment les muscles du pouce et de l’index de la main droite, n’étant plus irrités par ce fluide, se relâchèrent au point qu’un volume des œuvres du marquis Caraccioli, que je tenais serré entre ces deux doigts, m’échappa sans que je m’en aperçusse, et tomba sur le foyer.","It will be easy to understand, after reading this preamble, why my head fell on my chest, and how the muscles of the thumb and index finger of the right hand, no longer being irritated by this fluid, relaxed to the point that a volume of the works of the Marquis Caraccioli, which I held tight between these two fingers, escaped me without my noticing it, and fell on the hearth.","After reading this preamble, you will easily understand why my head fell on my chest, and why the muscles of the thumb and forefinger of my right hand, being no longer excited by the electric fluid, became so relaxed that a volume of the works of the Marquis Caraccioli, which I was holding tightly between these two fingers, imperceptibly eluded my grasp, and fell upon the hearth.","* Having read this preamble, one will have little difficulty conceiving why my head fell onto my chest or how the muscles of the thumb and index finger of my right hand, being no longer quickened by that fluid, relaxed to the point that a volume of the marquis Caraccioli,* which I was holding between that very thumb and finger, slipped out without my noticing and fell onto the hearthstone."
"Un jour (l’avouerai-je ?) sans ce fidèle domestique qui la rattrapa au bas de l’escalier, l’étourdie s’acheminait vers la cour sans épée, aussi hardiment que le grand maître des cérémonies portant l’auguste baguette.","One day (shall I admit it?) without this faithful servant who caught up with her at the bottom of the stairs, the scatterbrain made her way towards the court without a sword, as boldly as the grand master of ceremonies bearing the august wand.","One day, I must confess, had it not been for this faithful servant, who caught it up just at the bottom of the staircase, the silly creature would have presented itself at court without a sword, as boldly as if it had been the chief gentleman-usher, bearing the august rod.","One day (shall I admit it?), before the intervention of this faithful servant, the scatterbrain was headed to the Court without his sword, as fearlessly as a master of ceremonies wielding his august wand."
"Au moment où la parure commence, l’amant n’est plus qu’un mari, et le bal seul devient l’amant.","The moment the adornment begins, the lover is no more than a husband, and the ball alone becomes the lover.","As soon as dressing begins, a lover is no more thought of than a husband would be; and the ball takes the place of a lover.","The moment the dressing begins, the lover becomes nothing more than a husband: the ball alone is the lover."

NEXT to my arm-chair, as we go northward, my bed comes into sight. It is placed at the end of my room, and forms the most agreeable perspective.

The elm-trees opposite my windows divide them into a thousand patterns as they dance upon my bed, and, reflecting its rose-and-white color, shed a charming tint around. I hear the confused twitter of the swallows that have taken possession of my roof, and the warbling of the birds that people the elms. Then do a thousand smiling fancies fill my soul; and in the whole universe no being enjoys an awakening so delightful, so peaceful, as mine.","Heading north from my armchair, we discover my bed, which sits at the back of the room and creates a most agreeable perspective: it is most felicitously situated, receiving the morning sun’s first rays as they shine through my curtains.—On lovely summer days , I see them advance along the white wall as the sun slowly rises; the elm trees outside my window break them up in a thousand different ways, sending them rippling across my pink and white bed, which everywhere casts a charming glow from their reflection.—I hear the confused twitter of the swallows that have made a home of the building’s roof, and the other birds that inhabit the elms: a thousand happy ideas fill my mind, and no man alive enjoys an awakening so pleasant and peaceful as mine."

Je n’aime pas les gens qui sont si fort les maîtres de leurs pas et de leurs idées, qui disent : « Aujourd’hui je ferai trois visites, j’écrirai quatre lettres, je finirai cet ouvrage que j’ai commencé ». – Mon âme est tellement ouverte à toutes sortes d’idées, de goûts et de sentiments ; elle reçoit si avidement tout ce qui se présente !… – Et pourquoi refuserait-elle les jouissances qui sont éparses sur le chemin si difficile de la vie ? Elles sont si rares, si clairsemées, qu’il faudrait être fou pour ne pas s’arrêter, se détourner même de son chemin, pour cueillir toutes celles qui sont à notre portée. Il n’en est pas de plus attrayante, selon moi, que de suivre ses idées à la piste, comme le chasseur poursuit le gibier, sans affecter de tenir aucune route. Aussi, lorsque je voyage dans ma chambre, je parcours rarement une ligne droite : je vais de ma table vers un tableau qui est placé dans un coin ; de là je pars obliquement pour aller à la porte ; mais, quoique en partant mon intention soit bien de m’y rendre, si je rencontre mon fauteuil en chemin, je ne fais pas de façons, et je m’y arrange tout de suite. – C’est un excellent meuble qu’un fauteuil ; il est surtout de la dernière utilité pour tout homme méditatif. Dans les longues soirées d’hiver, il est quelquefois doux et toujours prudent de s’y étendre mollement, loin du fracas des assemblées nombreuses. – Un bon feu, des livres, des plumes, que de ressources contre l’ennui ! Et quel plaisir encore d’oublier ses livres et ses plumes pour tisonner son feu, en se livrant à quelque douce méditation, ou en arrangeant quelques rimes pour égayer ses amis ! Les heures glissent alors sur vous, et tombent en silence dans l’éternité, sans vous faire sentir leur triste passage.","My room is situated under the forty-fifth degree of latitude, according to Father Beccaria's measurements; its direction is from east to west; it forms a long square which is thirty-six paces in circumference, skimming the wall very closely. My journey, however, will contain more; for I will often cross long and wide, or else diagonally, without following any rule or method. – I will even do zigzags, and I will go through all the possible lines in geometry if the need requires it. I don't like people who are so much masters of their steps and their ideas, who say: ""Today I will make three visits, I will write four letters, I will finish this work that I started"". – My soul is so open to all sorts of ideas, tastes and feelings; she receives everything that presents itself so eagerly!… – And why would she refuse the pleasures that are scattered along the so difficult path of life? They are so rare, so sparse, that one would have to be mad not to stop, even to turn away from one's path, to pick all those within reach. There is nothing more attractive, in my opinion, than to follow one's ideas on the trail, as the hunter pursues the game, without affecting to hold any road. Also, when I travel in my room, I rarely walk in a straight line: I go from my table to a picture that is placed in a corner; from there I go obliquely to go to the door; but, although when I leave it is my intention to go there, if I meet my armchair on the way, I do not make any fuss, and I arrange myself there at once. – An armchair is an excellent piece of furniture; it is above all of the ultimate utility for every meditative man. In the long winter evenings, it is sometimes pleasant and always prudent to stretch out there gently, far from the din of the numerous assemblies. – A good fire, books, pens, what resources against boredom! And what pleasure still to forget one's books and pens to poke one's fire, giving oneself up to some gentle meditation, or arranging a few rhymes to enliven one's friends! The hours then slip over you, and fall silently into eternity, without making you feel their sad passage.","Latitude and Topography. MY room is situated in latitude 48° east, according to the measurement of Father Beccaria. It lies east and west, and, if you keep very close to the wall, forms a parallelogram of thirty-six steps round. My journey will, however, be longer than this; for I shall traverse my room up and down and across, without rule or plan. I shall even zig-zag about, following, if needs be, every possible geometrical line. I am no admirer of people who are such masters of their every step and every idea that they can say: “To-morrow I shall make three calls, write four letters, and finish this or that work.” So open is my soul to all sorts of ideas, tastes, and feelings; so greedily does it absorb whatever comes first, that ... but why should it deny itself the delights that are scattered along life’s hard path? So few and far between are they, that it would indeed be senseless not to stop, and even turn aside, to gather such as are placed within our reach. Of these joys, none, to my thinking, is more attractive than following the course of one’s fancies as a hunter follows his game, without pretending to keep to any set route. Hence, when I travel in my room, I seldom keep to a straight line. From my table I go towards a picture which is placed in a corner; thence I set out in an oblique direction for the door; and then, although on starting I had intended to return to my table, yet, if I chance to fall in with my arm-chair on the way, I at once, and most unceremoniously, take up my quarters therein. By the by, what a capital article of furniture an arm-chair is, and, above all, how convenient to a thoughtful man. In long winter evenings it is ofttimes sweet, and always prudent, to stretch yourself therein, far from the bustle of crowded assemblies. A good fire, some books and pens; what safeguards these against ennui! And how pleasant, again, to forget books and pens in order to stir the fire, while giving one’s self up to some agreeable meditation, or stringing together a few rhymes for the amusement of friends, as the hours glide by and fall into eternity, without making their sad passage felt.","My room is situated at forty-five degrees latitude, according to the measurements of Father Beccaria. * It runs from east to west, and forms a rectangle that is thirty-six paces around, keeping well nigh to the walls. My voyage, however, will encompass a great deal more; for I shall often walk across it lengthwise and breadthwise, and diagonally too, following no rule or method.—I shall even zigzag this way and that, and follow every line possible in geometry, if necessary. I do not care much for people who so control their steps and ideas, who say, “Today I will pay three visits, write four letters, and finish the piece I have begun. ”—My soul is so open to every manner of idea, taste, and sentiment, it avidly takes in everything that turns up! . . . —And why should it refuse any of the delights scattered along the difficult path of life? They are so rare, so few and far between, that one would have to be mad not to stop, indeed to stray from one’s path, to gather every one that is within reach. And there is none more enticing, in my opinion, than to follow the trail of one’s ideas, as the hunter stalks his quarry, without keeping to any one course. I too, when traveling in my room, rarely follow a straight line! I go from my table toward a painting hung in a corner, and from there I set off obliquely for the door; yet although in setting out my intention is to reach that spot, if I happen to encounter my armchair along the way, without hesitation I settle right down into it.—What a splendid piece of furniture an armchair is, of utmost importance and usefulness for every contemplative man. During those long winter evenings, it is often sweet and always advisable to stretch out luxuriously in one, far from the din of the crowds. A good fire, a few books, some quills— what excellent antidotes to boredom! And what a pleasure then to forget your books and quills and to poke the fire, relinquishing your thoughts to some pleasant meditation—or composing some rhymes to amuse your friends: the hours slide over you and fall silently into eternity, and you do not even feel their melancholy passing."
"Je mis aussitôt mon habit de voyage, après l’avoir examiné avec un œil de complaisance ; et ce fut alors que je résolus de faire un chapitre ad hoc, pour le faire connaître au lecteur. La forme et l’utilité de ces habits étant assez généralement connues, je traiterai plus particulièrement de leur influence sur l’esprit des voyageurs. – Mon habit de voyage pour l’hiver est fait de l’étoffe la plus chaude et la plus moelleuse qu’il m’ait été possible de trouver ; il m’enveloppe entièrement de la tête aux pieds ; et lorsque je suis dans mon fauteuil, les mains dans mes poches et la tête enfoncée dans le collet de l’habit, je ressemble à la statue de Vishnou sans pieds et sans mains, qu’on voit dans les pagodes des Indes.","I immediately put on my traveling coat, after having examined it with an eye of complaisance; and it was then that I resolved to make a chapter ad hoc, to make it known to the reader. The form and utility of these garments being fairly generally known, I shall deal more particularly with their influence on the minds of travellers. “My traveling winter coat is made of the warmest, softest stuff I could find; it completely envelops me from head to toe; and when I am in my armchair, my hands in my pockets and my head buried in the collar of my coat, I look like the statue of Vishnu without feet and without hands, which one sees in the pagodas of India.","The Travelling-coat.

The form and use of such coats being rather generally known, I shall speak more specifically of their influence on the traveler’s mind.—My winter traveling coat is made of the warmest, most luxurious fabric I could find: it covers me whole, from head to toe; and when I am in my armchair, hands in my pockets, head buried in the coat’s collar, I resemble the footless, handless statue of Vishnu that one sees in the temples of India."
"Hélas ! il est si rare que la laideur se reconnaisse et casse le miroir ! En vain les glaces se multiplient autour de nous, et réfléchissent avec une exactitude géométrique la lumière et la vérité : au moment où les rayons vont pénétrer dans notre œil et nous peindre tels que nous sommes, l’amour-propre glisse son prisme trompeur entre nous et notre image, et nous présente une divinité.","Alas! it is so rare that ugliness recognizes itself and breaks the mirror! In vain the mirrors multiply around us, and reflect light and truth with geometric precision: at the moment when the rays are about to penetrate our eye and paint us as we are, self-love slips its deceptive prism between us and our image, and presents us with a divinity.","Alas! how rare it is for ugliness to recognize itself and break the mirror!

Voila donc qui est entendu ; il faudra vous résigner et attendre que votre rôle de mari soit passé. – J’en connais plus d’un qui voudraient en être quittes a si bon marché.,Here then is what is understood; you will have to resign yourself and wait until your role as husband has passed. “I know more than one who would like to get off so cheaply.,"You must resign yourself to your fate, and wait until the husband’s rôle is played.

"Je passerai sous silence le plaisir qu’éprouve le physicien méditant sur les étranges phénomènes de la lumière qui représente tous les objets de la nature sur cette surface polie.

"Mais, si je cherche ainsi de feintes afflictions, je trouve, en revanche, dans ce monde imaginaire, la vertu, la bonté, le désintéressement, que je n’ai pas encore trouvés réunis dans le monde réel où j’existe. – J’y trouve une femme comme je la désire, sans humeur, sans légèreté, sans détour ; je ne dis rien de la beauté ; on peut s’en fier a mon imagination : je la fais si belle qu’il n’y a rien à redire. Ensuite, fermant le livre, qui ne répand plus à mes idées, je la prends par la main, et nous parcourons ensemble un pays mille fois plus délicieux que celui d’Eden. Quel peintre pourrait représenter le paysage enchanté ou j’ai placé la divinité de mon cœur ? et quel poète pourra jamais décrire les sensations vives et variées que j’éprouve dans ces régions enchantées ?","But, if I thus seek feigned afflictions, I find, on the other hand, in this imaginary world, virtue, kindness, disinterestedness, which I have not yet found united in the real world where I exist. – I find there a woman as I desire, without temper, without levity, without detour; I say nothing of beauty; you can rely on my imagination: I make it so beautiful that there is nothing to complain about. Then, closing the book, which no longer spreads my ideas, I take her by the hand, and together we travel through a country a thousand times more delicious than that of Eden. What painter could represent the enchanted landscape where I placed the divinity of my heart? and what poet will ever be able to describe the vivid and varied sensations I experience in these enchanted regions?","But if I go out of my way in search of unreal afflictions, I find in return, such virtue, kindness, and disinterestedness in this imaginary world as I have never yet found united in the real world around me.

And then, closing the book, which no longer keeps pace with my ideas, I take the fair one by the hand, and we travel together over a country a thousand times more delightful than Eden itself. What painter could represent the fairy land in which I have placed the goddess of my heart?

"Un jour nous montions avec peine le long d’un sentier rapide : l’aimable Rosalie était en avant ; son agilité lui donnait des ailes : nous ne pouvions la suivre. – Tout à coup, arrivée au sommet d’un tertre, elle se tourna vers nous pour reprendre haleine, et sourit à notre lenteur. – Jamais peut-être les deux couleurs dont je fais l’éloge n’avaient ainsi triomphé. – Ses joues enflammées, ses lèvres de corail, ses dents brillantes, son cou d’albâtre, sur un fond de verdure, frappèrent tous les regards. Il fallut nous arrêter pour la contempler : je ne dis rien de ses yeux bleus, ni du regard qu’elle jeta sur nous, parce que je sortirais de mon sujet, et que d’ailleurs je n’y pense jamais que le moins qu’il m’est possible. Il me suffit d’avoir donné le plus bel exemple imaginable de la supériorité de ces deux couleurs sur toutes les autres, et de leur influence sur le bonheur des hommes.","One day we were climbing with difficulty along a steep path: the amiable Rosalie was in front; her agility gave her wings: we couldn't follow her. – Suddenly, having reached the top of a mound, she turned towards us to catch her breath, and smiled at our slowness. “Perhaps the two colors I praise had never thus triumphed. – Her inflamed cheeks, her coral lips, her shining teeth, her alabaster neck, against a background of verdure, struck all eyes. We had to stop to look at her: I said nothing about her blue eyes, nor about the look she cast on us, because I would be getting off topic, and besides, I never think about it except the least. it is possible for me. It is enough for me to have given the finest example imaginable of the superiority of these two colors over all the others, and of their influence on the happiness of men.","One day we were with some difficulty climbing a steep pathway. The amiable Rosalie, whose agility had given her wings, was far in front. We could not overtake her. All on a sudden, having reached the top of a hillock, she turned toward us to take breath, and smiled at our slowness. Never, perhaps, did the two colors whose praise I proclaim so triumph. Her burning cheeks, her coral lips, her alabaster neck, were thrown into relief by the verdure around, and entranced us all. We could not but pause and gaze upon her. I will not speak of her blue eyes, or of the glance she cast upon us, because this would be going from the subject, and because I dwell upon these memories as little as possible. Let it suffice that I have given the best illustration conceivable of the superiority of these two colors over all others, and of their influence upon the happiness of man.","One day we were walking with difficulty up a steep path.

"« Je vous assure, lui dit Aspasie, que la plupart des coiffures qui sont représentées dans le cahier que je feuillette mériteraient le même sort que la vôtre, tant elles sont extravagantes ! » La belle Athénienne s’amusait extrêmement parcourir ces estampes, et s’étonnait avec raison de la variété et de la bizarrerie des ajustements modernes. Une figure entre autres la frappa : c’était celle d’une jeune dame représentée avec une coiffure des plus élégantes, et qu’Aspasie trouva seulement un peu trop haute ; mais la pièce de gaze qui couvrait la gorge était d’une ampleur si extraordinaire qu’ « à peine apercevait-on la moitié du visage ». Aspasie, ne sachant pas que ces formes prodigieuses n’étaient que l’ouvrage de l’amidon, ne put s’empêcher de témoigner un étonnement qui aurait redoublé en sens inverse si la gaze eût été transparente.","""I assure you,"" Aspasie told him, ""that most of the hairstyles represented in the notebook I'm leafing through would deserve the same fate as yours, they are so extravagant!"" The beautiful Athenian was extremely amused perusing these prints, and was justly amazed at the variety and oddity of the modern adjustments. One figure among others struck her: it was that of a young lady represented with the most elegant hairstyle, and whom Aspasie found only a little too high; but the piece of gauze that covered the throat was of such extraordinary size that “you could barely see half of the face”. Aspasia, not knowing that these prodigious forms were only the work of starch, could not help showing an astonishment which would have redoubled in the opposite direction if the gauze had been transparent.","“I assure you,” said Aspasia, “that most of the head-dresses represented in the pages I have been turning over deserve the same fate as yours, so very extravagant are they.” The fair Athenian amused herself vastly in looking over the engravings, and was very reasonably surprised by the variety and oddity of modern contrivances. One figure, especially struck her. It was that of a young lady with a really elegant head-dress which Aspasia only thought somewhat too high. But the piece of gauze that covered the neck was so very full you could scarcely see half her face. Aspasia, not knowing that these extraordinary developments were produced by starch, could not help showing a surprise which would have been redoubled (but inversely), had the gauze been transparent.","“I can assure you,” said Aspasia to him, “that most of the hairstyles presented in this booklet I have been leafing through deserve the same fate as yours. ”—The beautiful Athenian was enjoying herself immensely as she perused those prints, and she had every reason to wonder at the variety and extravagance of modern adornments. One figure especially caught her eye, that of a young lady presented in a coiffure of the most elegant sort, which Aspasia found a bit too high; on the other hand, the veil covering her bust was so vast that scarcely half her face was visible. Not knowing that these extraordinary shapes were but the product of starch, Aspasia could not help but express amazement, though her surprise would have been doubly great, for the opposite reason, had the veil been transparent."
"« Il vous sied bien, Madame (pour éloigner de la discussion toute idée de familiarité), il vous sied bien de vous donner des airs de décence et de vertu !

Why weren't you there? – Why would you have the right to enjoy without me, in the frequent trips you make alone? “Have I ever disapproved of your seances in the Empyrean or the Champs-Elysées, your conversations with intellects, your deep speculations (a little mockery as we see), your castles in Spain, your sublime systems? And I would not have the right, when you thus abandon me, to enjoy the benefits that nature grants me and the pleasures that she presents to me! »","“Really, madame” (this madame was meant to remove from the discussion anything like familiarity), “really, this affectation of virtuous decorum is highly becoming to you! Is it not to the sallies of your imagination, and to your extravagant ideas, that I owe what in me displeases you? What right have you to go on those pleasant excursions so often, without taking me with you?

Ha! Are not your flights of fancy and your extravagant ideas the cause of all that you find disagreeable in me?—Eh, why were you not here?—Why should you have the right to enjoy yourself without me, all by yourself, on your frequent voyages?—Have I ever objected to your sojourns in the empyrean or in the Elysian Fields, your conversations with invisible intelligences, your profound speculations (a bit of mockery, as we can see), your castles in the air, your sublime systems?—So why, when you abandon me so, should I not also have the right to enjoy the benefits and pleasures that nature offers me?”"

"Je résolus de dîner en cet endroit : la matinée était fort avancée, et un pas de plus dans ma chambre aurait porté mon dîner à la nuit. Je me glissai jusqu’au bord de mon fauteuil, et, mettant les deux pieds sur la cheminée, j’attendis patiemment le repas. – C’est une attitude délicieuse que celle-là : il serait, je crois, bien difficile d’en trouver une autre qui réunît autant d’avantages, et qui fût aussi commode pour les séjours inévitables dans un long voyage.","I resolved to dine there: the morning was far advanced, and one step further in my room would have brought my dinner into the night. I slipped to the edge of my armchair, and putting both feet on the fireplace, I patiently awaited the meal. “It is a delightful attitude, that one: it would be, I believe, very difficult to find another which combined so many advantages, and which was so convenient for the inevitable stays on a long journey.","I determined to dine where I was. The morning was far advanced, and another step in my room would have delayed my dinner until night-fall. I let myself slip to the edge of my chair, and putting both feet on the mantel-piece, patiently awaited my meal. This was a most comfortable attitude; indeed, it would be difficult to find another possessing so many advantages, and so well adapted to the inevitable sojourns of a long voyage.","I decided to take my lunch in that very spot. The morning was wearing on; another step farther in my room would have carried my midday meal over into the night. I slid to the edge of my armchair, and setting both feet on the mantelpiece, I patiently awaited my meal.—What an exquisite position, that: it would, I think, be very difficult to find one that combines as many advantages and is as convenient for the inevitable stops one must make on a long voyage."
