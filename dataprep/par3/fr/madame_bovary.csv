"Il serait maintenant impossible à aucun de nous de se rien rappeler de lui. C’était un garçon de tempérament modéré, qui jouait aux récréations, travaillait à l’étude, écoutant en classe, dormant bien au dortoir, mangeant bien au réfectoire. Il avait pour correspondant un quincaillier en gros de la rue Ganterie, qui le faisait sortir une fois par mois, le dimanche, après que sa boutique était fermée, l’envoyait se promener sur le port à regarder les bateaux, puis le ramenait au collège dès sept heures, avant le souper. Le soir de chaque jeudi, il écrivait une longue lettre à sa mère, avec de l’encre rouge et trois pains à cacheter ; puis il repassait ses cahiers d’histoire, ou bien lisait un vieux volume d’Anacharsis qui traînait dans l’étude. En promenade, il causait avec le domestique, qui était de la campagne comme lui.","It would now be impossible for any of us to remember anything about him. He was a boy of moderate temperament, who played at recess, worked at study, listened in class, slept well in the dormitory, ate well in the refectory. His correspondent was a wholesale hardware store in the rue Ganterie, who took him out once a month, on Sundays, after his shop was closed, sent him out for a walk in the harbor to look at the boats, then brought him back to college. at seven o'clock, before supper. Every Thursday evening he wrote a long letter to his mother in red ink and three sealing loaves; then he went over his history notebooks, or else read an old volume of Anacharsis lying around in the study. When out walking, he chatted with the servant, who was from the country like him.","It would be impossible by now for any of us to recall a thing about him. He was a boy of even temperament, who played at recess, worked in study hall, listening in class, sleeping well in the dormitory, eating well in the dining hall. He had as local guardian a wholesale hardware dealer in the rue Ganterie, who would take him out once a month, on a Sunday, after his shop was closed, send him off to walk along the harbor looking at the boats, then return him to the school by seven o’clock, before supper. In the evening, every Thursday, he would write a long letter to his mother, with red ink and three pats of sealing wax; then he would review his history notebooks or read an old volume of Anacharsis that was lying around in the study hall. Out walking, he would talk to the servant, who, like him, was from the country.","It would be very difficult today for any of us to say what he was like. There was nothing striking about him: he played during recess, worked in study-hall, paid attention in class, slept soundly in the dormitory, ate heartily in the refectory. His local guardian was a wholesale hardware dealer in the rue Ganterie, who called for him one Sunday a month after early closing, sent him for a walk along the riverfront to look at the boats, then brought him back to school by seven, in time for supper. Every Thursday night Charles wrote a long letter to his mother, using red ink and three seals; then he looked over his history notes, or leafed through an old volume of Anacharsis that lay around the study-hall. When his class went for outings he talked with the school servant who accompanied them, a countryman like himself."
"Elle le charmait par quantité de délicatesses : c’était tantôt une manière nouvelle de façonner pour les bougies des bobèches de papier, un volant qu’elle changeait à sa robe, ou le nom extraordinaire d’un mets bien simple, et que la bonne avait manqué, mais que Charles, jusqu’au bout, avalait avec plaisir. Elle vit à Rouen des dames qui portaient à leur montre un paquet de breloques ; elle acheta des breloques. Elle voulut sur sa cheminée deux grands vases de verre bleu, et, quelque temps après, un nécessaire d’ivoire, avec un dé de vermeil. Moins Charles comprenait ces élégances, plus il en subissait la séduction. Elles ajoutaient quelque chose au plaisir de ses sens et à la douceur de son foyer. C’était comme une Poussière d’or qui sablait tout du long le petit sentier de sa vie.","She charmed him with a number of delicacies: sometimes it was a new way of fashioning paper bobèches for candles, a frill that she changed into her dress, or the extraordinary name of a very simple dish, which the maid had missed, but which Charles, right to the end, swallowed with pleasure. She saw ladies at Rouen who wore a bundle of trinkets on their watches; she bought charms. She wanted two large vases of blue glass on her mantelpiece, and, some time later, an ivory case with a silver-gilt thimble. The less Charles understood these elegances, the more he suffered from their seduction. They added something to the pleasure of his senses and to the comfort of his home. It was like a dust of gold that sanded all along the little path of his life.","She would delight him with countless niceties; it was sometimes a new way of fashioning paper sconces for the candles, a flounce she would change on her dress, or the extraordinary name for a perfectly simple dish that the servant had spoiled, but every last bit of which Charles would swallow with pleasure. In Rouen she saw some ladies wearing clusters of charms on their watches; she bought some watch charms. She wanted two large vases of blue glass on her mantelpiece and, sometime after, an ivory sewing box, with a silver-gilt thimble. The less Charles understood these refinements, the more captivating he found them. They added something to the pleasure of his senses and to the sweetness of his home. They were like gold dust sprinkled all along the little path of his life.","She delighted him by countless little niceties: a new way of making sconces out of paper to catch the wax under candles, a flounce that she changed on her dress, or the fancy name of some very plain dish that the maid hadn’t got right but that Charles enjoyed eating every bit of. In Rouen she saw ladies with charms dangling from their watch fobs; she bought some charms. She took a fancy to a pair of large blue glass vases for her mantelpiece, and a little later to an ivory workbox with a silver-gilt thimble. The less Charles understood these refinements, the more alluring he found them. They added something to the pleasure of his senses and the charm of his home. They were like a trickle of golden dust along the petty pathway of his life."
"– Aussi, disait Rodolphe, je m’enfonce dans une tristesse…","– Also, said Rodolphe, I sink into a sadness…","“And so I myself,” said Rodolphe, “sink into such melancholy …”","“So,” said Rodolphe, “I just get more and more engulfed in gloom as time goes on …”"

"Alors, afin de procéder dans l’ordre, le Suisse les conduisit jusqu’à l’entrée près de la place, où, leur montrant avec sa canne un grand cercle de pavés noirs, sans inscriptions ni ciselures :","So, in order to proceed in order, the Swiss led them to the entrance near the square, where, showing them with his cane a large circle of black cobblestones, without inscriptions or carvings:","Then, so that they might proceed in the right order, the verger led them to the entrance close to the square, where, pointing with his staff to a great circle of black paving stones without inscription or engraving:","Insisting that they must “begin at the beginning,” the verger led them outside the entrance door to the edge of the square, and there pointed with his staff to a large circle of black stones in the pavement, devoid of carving or inscription: “That,” he said majestically, “is the circumference of the great Amboise bell."
"Elle ne tarda pas à vomir du sang. Ses lèvres se serrèrent davantage. Elle avait les membres crispés, le corps couvert de taches brunes, et son pouls glissait sous les doigts comme un fil tendu, comme une corde de harpe près de se rompre.","She was soon vomiting blood. His lips tightened more. Her limbs were tense, her body covered with brown spots, and her pulse slipped under her fingers like a taut thread, like a harp string about to break.","She was soon vomiting blood. Her lips pressed together more tightly. Her limbs were contracted, her body was covered with brown spots, and her pulse was slipping under their fingers like a taut thread, like a harp string about to snap.","Soon she was vomiting blood. Her lips pressed together more tightly. Her limbs were contorted, her body was covered with brown blotches, her pulse quivered under the doctor’s fingers like a taut thread, like a harpstring about to snap."
"Puis elle pensa qu’elle s’était trompée. Au reste, elle n’en savait rien. Tout, en elle-même et au dehors, l’abandonnait. Elle se sentait perdue, roulant au hasard dans des abîmes indéfinissables ; et ce fut presque avec joie qu’elle aperçut, en arrivant à la Croix rouge, ce bon Homais qui regardait charger sur l’Hirondelle une grande boîte pleine de provisions pharmaceutiques. Il tenait à sa main, dans un foulard, six cheminots pour son épouse.","Then she thought she was wrong. Besides, she didn't know. Everything, inside and outside, abandoned her. She felt lost, rolling haphazardly through indefinable abysses; and it was almost with joy that she perceived, on arriving at the Red Cross, this good Homais who was watching the loading on the Hirondelle of a large box full of pharmaceutical provisions. He held in his hand, in a scarf, six railway workers for his wife.","Then she thought she had been mistaken. The truth was, she had no idea. Everything, within and outside her, was abandoning her. She felt lost, tumbling haphazardly through indefinable chasms; and it was almost with joy that she saw, when she reached the Croix Rouge, good old Homais watching as a large box full of pharmaceutical supplies was loaded onto the Hirondelle. In his hand he held, wrapped in a scarf, six cheminots for his wife.","Then she thought that she might be mistaken. How could she tell? She had no way of knowing. Everything—everything within her, everything without—was abandoning her. She felt lost, rolling dizzily down into some dark abyss; and she was almost glad, when she reached the Croix-Rouge, to see good old Monsieur Homais. He was watching a case of pharmaceutical supplies being loaded onto the Hirondelle, and in his hand he carried a present for his wife—six cheminots wrapped in a foulard handkerchief."
"« Je ne vous oublierai pas, croyez-le bien, et j’aurai continuellement pour vous un dévouement profond ; mais, un jour, tôt ou tard, cette ardeur (c’est là le sort des choses humaines) se fût diminuée, sans doute ! Il nous serait venu des lassitudes, et qui sait même si je n’aurais pas eu l’atroce douleur d’assister à vos remords et d’y participer moi-même, puisque je les aurais causés. L’idée seule des chagrins qui vous arrivent me torture, Emma ! Oubliez-moi ! Pourquoi faut-il que je vous aie connue ? Pourquoi étiez-vous si belle ? Est-ce ma faute ? O mon Dieu ! non, non, n’en accusez que la fatalité ! »","“I will not forget you, believe me, and I will always have a deep devotion to you; but, one day, sooner or later, this ardor (this is the fate of human affairs) would doubtless have diminished! We would have come to weariness, and who knows even if I would not have had the excruciating pain of witnessing your remorse and of participating in it myself, since I would have caused it. The mere idea of the sorrows that befall you tortures me, Emma! Forget me ! Why do I have to know you? Why were you so beautiful? Is it my fault? Oh my God ! no, no, blame only fatality! »","I will never forget you, believe me, and I will continue to be deeply devoted to you; but one day, sooner or later, this ardor would no doubt have diminished (such being the destiny of all things human)! We would have had moments of weariness, and who knows, even, if I would not have suffered the atrocious pain of witnessing your remorse and partaking of it myself, since I would have been the cause of it. The very idea of the sorrows that burden you is torture to me, Emma! Forget me! Why did I ever have to meet you? Why were you so beautiful? Is it my fault? Oh, Lord, no! Fate is to blame, only fate!","“I’ll never forget you—believe me—and I’ll always feel the deepest devotion to you. But some day sooner or later our passion would have cooled—inevitably—it’s the way with everything human. We would have had moments of weariness. Who knows—I might even have had the dreadful anguish of witnessing your remorse—and of sharing in it, since it would have been I who caused it. The very thought of the grief in store for you is a torture to me, Emma! Forget me! Why was it ordained that we should meet? Why were you so beautiful? Is the fault mine? In God’s name, no! No! Fate alone is to blame—nothing and no one but fate!”"
"– Car, disait l’ecclésiastique d’un ton paterne, tu négligeais un peu tes devoirs ; on te voyait rarement à l’office divin ; combien y a-t-il d’années que tu ne t’es approché de la sainte table ? Je comprends que tes occupations, que le tourbillon du monde aient pu t’écarter du soin de ton salut. Mais à présent, c’est l’heure d’y réfléchir. Ne désespère pas cependant ; j’ai connu de grands coupables qui, près de comparaître devant Dieu (tu n’en es point encore là, je le sais bien), avaient imploré sa miséricorde, et qui certainement sont morts dans les meilleures dispositions. Espérons que, tout comme eux, tu nous donneras de bons exemples ! Ainsi, par précaution, qui donc t’empêcherait de réciter matin et soir un « Je vous salue, Marie, pleine de grâce », et un « Notre Père, qui êtes aux cieux » ? Oui fais cela ! pour moi, pour m’obliger. Qu’est-ce que ça coûte ?… Me le promets-tu ?","“For,” said the ecclesiastic in a paternal tone, “you neglected your duties a little; you were rarely seen at the divine office; how many years have you not approached the holy table? I understand that your occupations, that the whirlwind of the world could have taken you away from the care of your salvation. But now is the time to think about it. Don't despair though; I have known great culprits who, close to appearing before God (you are not there yet, I know it well), had implored his mercy, and who certainly died in the best dispositions. We hope that, just like them, you will give us good examples! So, as a precaution, who would prevent you from reciting morning and evening a “Hail Mary, full of grace”, and an “Our Father, who art in heaven”? Yes do that! for me, to oblige me. What does it cost?... Do you promise me?","“For,” said the clergyman in a fatherly tone, “you were neglecting your duties a little; one rarely saw you at the divine service; how many years has it been since you approached the holy altar? I understand that your occupations, the hustle and bustle of the world, may have distracted you from tending to your salvation. But now it’s time to reflect on it. Do not despair, however; I have known some great sinners who, when they were about to appear before God (you’ve not yet reached that point , I’m well aware), implored His mercy and certainly died in the best of situations. Let us hope that, like them, you will set us a good example! For instance, as a precaution, why not recite a ‘Hail Mary, full of grace’ and an ‘Our Father, who art in heaven’ every morning and every evening? Yes! Do this for me, to oblige me. What will it cost you? … Will you promise?”","“You’ve been a little neglectful of your religious duties,” he pointed out in a paternal tone. “I’ve seldom seen you at Mass. How many years is it since you’ve been to Communion? It’s understandable that your work and other distractions should have made you careless about your eternal salvation. But now is the time to think about it. Don’t give way to despair: I’ve known grievous sinners who implored God’s mercy when they were about to appear before Him— I know you haven’t reached that point yet—and who certainly made better deaths as a result. Be an example to us, as they were! What’s to prevent you from saying a Hail Mary and an Our Father every night and morning just as a precaution? Do it! Do it for me, to oblige me! It doesn’t amount to much. Will you promise?”"
"– Eh bien, reprit la nourrice poussant des soupirs entre chaque mot, j’ai peur qu’il ne se fasse une tristesse de me voir prendre du café toute seule ; vous savez, les hommes…","“Well,” resumed the nurse, heaving a sigh between each word, “I'm afraid he'll be sad to see me having coffee alone; you know, men...","“Well,” the wet nurse resumed, heaving a sigh after every word, “I’m afraid he’ll be vexed to see me drinking coffee on my own—you know, men …”","“Well, what I mean is,” the wet nurse said, sighing after every word, “I’m afraid he wouldn’t like it, seeing me sitting there drinking coffee by myself; you know how men are, they …”"
"Ce fut moins par vanité que dans le seul but de lui complaire. Il ne discutait pas ses idées ; il acceptait tous ses goûts ; il devenait sa maîtresse plutôt qu’elle n’était la sienne.

Où donc avait-elle appris cette corruption, presque immatérielle à force d’être profonde et dissimulée ?","It was less out of vanity than for the sole purpose of pleasing him. He did not discuss his ideas; he accepted all his tastes; he was becoming his mistress rather than her being his. She had tender words with kisses that took her soul away. Where had she learned this corruption, almost immaterial by dint of being deep and concealed?","He did this less out of vanity than with the sole aim of pleasing her. He did not question her ideas; he accepted all her tastes; he was becoming her mistress more than she was his. She said tender things to him and gave him kisses that transported his soul. Where could she have learned this depravity, so deep and so dissembled that it was almost incorporeal?","He did that less out of vanity than out of a desire to please her. He never disputed any of her ideas; he fell in with all her tastes: he was becoming her mistress, far more than she was his. Her sweet words and her kisses swept away his soul.

"Et, comme elle n’osait, il s’avança lui-même, les ciseaux à la main. Il tremblait si fort, qu’il piqua la peau des tempes en plusieurs places. Enfin, se raidissant contre l’émotion, Homais donna deux ou trois grands coups au hasard, ce qui fit des marques blanches dans cette belle chevelure noire.","And, as she dared not, he came forward himself, scissors in hand. He was shaking so hard that he pricked the skin of his temples in several places. Finally, bracing himself against the emotion, Homais gave two or three sweeping blows at random, which left white marks in that beautiful black hair.","And since she did not dare, he stepped forward himself, the scissors in his hand. He was shaking so hard that he punctured the skin of the temples in several places. At last, stiffening himself against his emotion, Homais made two or three large cuts at random, leaving white marks in that lovely head of black hair.","She didn’t dare, and he stepped forward himself, scissors in hand. He trembled so violently that he nicked the skin on the temples in several places. Finally, steeling himself, Homais slashed blindly two or three times, leaving white marks in the beautiful black tresses."
"Ce qu’il ne comprenait pas, c’était tout ce trouble dans une chose aussi simple que l’amour. Elle avait un motif, une raison, et comme un auxiliaire à son attachement.","What he didn't understand was all the trouble in something as simple as love. She had a motive, a reason, and like an auxiliary to her attachment.","What he did not understand was all this disturbance over such a simple thing as love. She had a motive, a reason, a sort of auxiliary force strengthening her passion for him.",He saw no reason why there should be all this to-do about so simple a thing as love-making. But for her there was a reason: there was a motive force that gave an additional impetus to her passion.
"– Ah ! encore, dit Rodolphe. Toujours les devoirs, je suis assommé de ces mots-là. Ils sont un tas de vieilles ganaches en gilet de flanelle, et de bigotes à chaufferette et à chapelet, qui continuellement nous chantent aux oreilles : « Le devoir ! le devoir ! » Eh ! parbleu ! le devoir, c’est de sentir ce qui est grand, de chérir ce qui est beau, et non pas d’accepter toutes les conventions de la société, avec les ignominies qu’elle nous impose.","– Ah! again, said Rodolphe. Always the homework, I am stunned by these words. They're a bunch of old goons in flannel waistcoats, and bigots in heaters and beads, who continually sing in our ears: ""Duty!"" the duty ! “Hey! parbleu! duty is to feel what is great, to cherish what is beautiful, and not to accept all the conventions of society, with the ignominies it imposes on us.","“Ah! Again!” said Rodolphe. “They’re always going on about one’s duty—I’m bored to death by the word. They’re a bunch of old drivelers in flannel vests, church hens with foot warmers and rosaries forever singing in our ears: ‘Duty! Duty!’ Lord help me! Our duty is to feel what is great, cherish what is beautiful—not to accept all of society’s conventions, with the humiliations it imposes on us.”","“Ah, there they go again!” said Rodolphe. “Duty, duty, always duty—I’m sick of that word. Listen to them! They’re a bunch of doddering old morons and bigoted old church mice with foot warmers and rosaries, always squeaking, ‘Duty! Duty!’ at us. I have my own idea of duty. Our duty is to feel what is great and love what is beautiful—not to accept all the social conventions and the infamies they impose on us.”"

"Les étoiles brillaient à travers les branches du jasmin sans feuilles. Ils entendaient derrière eux la rivière qui coulait, et, de temps à autre, sur la berge, le claquement des roseaux secs. Des massifs d’ombre, çà et là, se bombaient dans l’obscurité, et parfois, frissonnant tous d’un seul mouvement, ils se dressaient et se penchaient comme d’immenses vagues noires qui se fussent avancées pour les recouvrir. Le froid de la nuit les faisait s’étreindre davantage ; les soupirs de leurs lèvres leur semblaient plus forts ; leurs yeux, qu’ils entrevoyaient à peine, leur paraissaient plus grands, et, au milieu du silence, il y avait des paroles dites tout bas qui tombaient sur leur âme avec une sonorité cristalline et qui s’y répercutaient en vibrations multipliées.","The stars shone through the branches of the leafless jasmine. They heard the river flowing behind them, and, from time to time, on the bank, the snapping of dry reeds. Clumps of shadow, here and there, bulged in the darkness, and sometimes, all quivering in one movement, they rose and leaned like immense black waves which had come forward to cover them. The cold of the night made them hug each other tighter; the sighs of their lips seemed to them stronger; their eyes, which they barely caught a glimpse of, seemed larger to them, and, in the midst of the silence, there were words spoken softly which fell on their soul with a crystalline sonority and which reverberated there in multiplied vibrations.","The stars shone through the branches of the leafless jasmine. They could hear the stream flowing behind them, and from time to time, on the bank, the clacking of dry reeds. Mounds of shadow loomed here and there in the darkness, and sometimes they would quiver with a single motion, rise up, and bend over like immense black waves advancing to submerge them. The cold of the night made them clasp each other all the more tightly; the sighs on their lips seemed to them deeper; their eyes, which they could barely glimpse, seemed larger; and in the midst of the silence, the words they spoke so quietly dropped into their souls, echoing and reechoing with a crystalline sonority in multiplied vibrations.","The stars glittered through the bare branches of the jasmine. Behind them they heard the flowing of the river, and now and again the crackle of dry reeds on the bank.

"Vers quatre heures du matin, Charles, bien enveloppé dans son manteau, se mit en route pour les Bertaux. Encore endormi par la chaleur du sommeil, il se laissait bercer au trot pacifique de sa bête. Quand elle s’arrêtait d’elle-même devant ces trous entourés d’épines que l’on creuse au bord des sillons, Charles se réveillant en sursaut, se rappelait vite la jambe cassée, et il tâchait de se remettre en mémoire toutes les fractures qu’il savait. La pluie ne tombait plus ; le jour commençait à venir, et, sur les branches des pommiers sans feuilles, des oiseaux se tenaient immobiles, hérissant leurs petites plumes au vent froid du matin. La plate campagne s’étalait à perte de vue, et les bouquets d’arbres autour des fermes faisaient, à intervalles éloignés, des taches d’un violet noir sur cette grande surface grise, qui se perdait à l’horizon dans le ton morne du ciel. Charles, de temps à autre, ouvrait les yeux ; puis, son esprit se fatiguant et le sommeil revenant de soi-même, bientôt il entrait dans une sorte d’assoupissement où, ses sensations récentes se confondant avec des souvenirs, lui-même se percevait double, à la fois étudiant et marié, couché dans son lit comme tout à l’heure, traversant une salle d’opérés comme autrefois. L’odeur chaude des cataplasmes se mêlait dans sa tête à la verte odeur de la rosée ; il entendait rouler sur leur tringle les anneaux de fer des lits et sa femme dormir… Comme il passait par Vassonville, il aperçut, au bord d’un fossé, un jeune garçon assis sur l’herbe.","Around four o'clock in the morning, Charles, well wrapped up in his coat, set out for Bertaux. Still asleep from the warmth of sleep, he let himself be rocked by the peaceful trot of his beast. When she stopped of her own accord in front of those holes surrounded by thorns that are dug at the edge of the furrows, Charles waking up with a start, quickly remembered the broken leg, and he tried to recall all the broken bones he knew. The rain was no longer falling; day was beginning to come, and on the branches of the leafless apple trees birds stood motionless, their little feathers bristling in the cold morning wind. The flat country stretched out as far as the eye could see, and the clumps of trees around the farms made, at distant intervals, spots of a black violet on this great gray surface, which was lost on the horizon in the gloomy tone. from the sky. Charles, from time to time, opened his eyes; then, his mind growing weary and sleep returning of its own accord, he soon fell into a kind of slumber in which, his recent sensations merging with memories, he perceived himself to be double, both student and married, lying in his bed like before, crossing an operating room like before. The warm smell of poultices mingled in his head with the green smell of dew; he heard the iron rings of the beds rolling on their rails and his wife sleeping.","At about four o’clock in the morning, Charles, well wrapped in his cloak, set off for Les Bertaux. Still drowsy from the warmth of his sleep, he swayed to the peaceful trot of his mare. Whenever she stopped of her own accord in front of one of those holes edged with brambles that farmers dig alongside their furrows, Charles, waking with a start, would quickly recall the broken leg and try to summon up what he remembered of all the fractures he knew. The rain was no longer falling; day was beginning to dawn, and on the branches of the leafless apple trees, birds were perched motionless, ruffling their little feathers in the cold morning wind. The flat country spread out as far as the eye could see, and the clumps of trees around the farms formed patches of dark violet at distant intervals on that vast gray surface, which vanished, at the horizon, into the bleak tones of the sky. Charles, from time to time, would open his eyes; then, his 			mind tiring and sleep returning of itself, he would soon enter a sort of somnolence in which, his recent sensations becoming confused with his memories, he would see himself double, at once student and married man, lying in his bed as he had been just now, crossing a surgical ward as in the past. The warm smell of the poultices would mingle in his head with the tart smell of the dew; he would hear the iron rings of the bed curtains running on their rods and his wife sleeping … As he was passing through Vassonville, he saw, by the side of a ditch, a young boy sitting on the grass.","About four o’clock in the morning Charles set out for Les Bertaux, wrapped in a heavy coat. He was still drowsy from his warm sleep, and the peaceful trot of his mare lulled him like the rocking of a cradle. Whenever she stopped of her own accord in front of one of those spike-edged holes that farmers dig along the roadside to protect their crops, he would wake up with a start, quickly remember the broken leg, and try to recall all the fractures he had ever seen. The rain had stopped; day was breaking, and on the leafless branches of the apple trees birds were perched motionless, ruffling up their little feathers in the cold morning wind. The countryside stretched flat as far as eye could see; and the tufts of trees clustered around the farmhouses were widely spaced dark purple stains on the vast gray surface that merged at the horizon into the dull tone of the sky. From time to time Charles would open his eyes; and then, his senses dimmed by a return of sleep, he would fall again into a drowsiness in which recent sensations became confused with older memories to give him double visions of himself: as husband and as student—lying in bed as he had been only an hour or so before, and walking through a surgical ward as in the past. In his mind the hot smell of poultices mingled with the fresh smell of dew; he heard at once the rattle of the curtain rings on hospital beds, and the sound of his wife’s breathing as she lay asleep. At Vassonville he saw a little boy sitting in the grass beside a ditch."

"Il n’avait plus, comme autrefois, de ces mots si doux qui la faisaient pleurer, ni de ces véhémentes caresses qui la rendaient folle ; si bien que leur grand amour, où elle vivait plongée, parut se diminuer sous elle, comme l’eau d’un fleuve qui s’absorberait dans son lit, et elle aperçut la vase.

"Paris, plus vague que l’Océan, miroitait donc aux yeux d’Emma dans une atmosphère vermeille. La vie nombreuse qui s’agitait en ce tumulte y était cependant divisée par parties, classée en tableaux distincts. Emma n’en apercevait que deux ou trois qui lui cachaient tous les autres, et représentaient à eux seuls l’humanité complète. Le monde des ambassadeurs marchait sur des parquets luisants, dans des salons lambrissés de miroirs, autour de tables ovales couvertes d’un tapis de velours à crépines d’or. Il y avait là des robes à queue, de grands mystères, des angoisses dissimulées sous des sourires. Venait ensuite la société des duchesses ; on y était pâle ; on se levait à quatre heures ; les femmes, pauvres anges ! portaient du point d’Angleterre au bas de leur jupon, et les hommes, capacités méconnues sous des dehors futiles, crevaient leurs chevaux par partie de plaisir, allaient passer à Bade la saison d’été, et, vers la quarantaine enfin, épousaient des héritières. Dans les cabinets de restaurant où l’on soupe après minuit riait, à la clarté des bougies, la foule bigarrée des gens de lettres et des actrices. Ils étaient, ceux-là, prodigues comme des rois, pleins d’ambitions idéales et de délires fantastiques. C’était une existence au-dessus des autres, entre ciel et terre, dans les orages, quelque chose de sublime. Quant au reste du monde, il était perdu, sans place précise, et comme n’existant pas. Plus les choses, d’ailleurs, étaient voisines, plus sa pensée s’en détournait. Tout ce qui l’entourait immédiatement, campagne ennuyeuse, petits bourgeois imbéciles, médiocrité de l’existence, lui semblait une exception dans le monde, un hasard particulier où elle se trouvait prise, tandis qu’au delà s’étendait à perte de vue l’immense pays des félicités et des passions. Elle confondait, dans son désir, les sensualités du luxe avec les joies du cœur, l’élégance des habitudes et les délicatesses du sentiment. Ne fallait-il pas à l’amour, comme aux plantes indiennes, des terrains préparés, une température particulière ? Les soupirs au clair de lune, les longues étreintes, les larmes qui coulent sur les mains qu’on abandonne, toutes les fièvres de la chair et les langueurs de la tendresse ne se séparaient donc pas du balcon des grands châteaux qui sont pleins de loisirs, d’un boudoir à stores de soie avec un tapis bien épais, des jardinières remplies, un lit monté sur une estrade, ni du scintillement des pierres précieuses et des aiguillettes de la livrée.","Paris, vaguer than the ocean, shimmered in Emma's eyes in a vermilion atmosphere. The numerous life which was agitated in this tumult was however divided there into parts, classified in distinct tables. Emma saw only two or three of them, which hid all the others from her, and alone represented complete humanity. The world of ambassadors walked on gleaming parquet floors, in salons paneled with mirrors, around oval tables covered with a carpet of velvet with gold strains. There were dresses with tails, great mysteries, anxieties concealed under smiles. Next came the society of duchesses; one was pale there; we got up at four o'clock; women, poor angels! wore English point at the bottom of their petticoats, and the men, unrecognized abilities under a futile exterior, killed their horses for pleasure, went to Baden for the summer season, and, towards forty finally, married women. heiresses. In the restaurant cabinets where one sups after midnight laughed, by the light of the candles, the motley crowd of men of letters and actresses. They were prodigal like kings, full of ideal ambitions and fantastic delusions. It was an existence above others, between heaven and earth, in storms, something sublime. As for the rest of the world, it was lost, without a precise place, and as if it did not exist. The closer things were, the more his thoughts turned away from them. Everything that immediately surrounded her, boring countryside, stupid petty bourgeois, mediocrity of existence, seemed to her an exception in the world, a particular chance in which she found herself caught, while beyond that stretched as far as the eye could see. the immense country of felicities and passions. She confused, in her desire, the sensualities of luxury with the joys of the heart, the elegance of habits and the delicacies of sentiment. Did not love, like Indian plants, require prepared soils, a particular temperature? The sighs in the moonlight, the long embraces, the tears which flow on the hands that one abandons, all the fevers of the flesh and the languor of tenderness were therefore not separated from the balcony of the great castles which are full of leisure. , of a boudoir with silk blinds and a very thick rug, filled planters, a bed mounted on a platform, or the glitter of precious stones and aiguillettes of the livery.","And so Paris, vaster than the Ocean, glimmered before Emma’s eyes in a rosy haze. But the teeming life of that tumultuous place was divided into separate parts, sorted into distinct tableaux. Emma saw only two or three, which concealed the rest from her and themselves alone represented all of humanity. The world of ambassadors walked over gleaming parquet floors, through drawing rooms lined with mirrors, around oval tables covered with velvet cloths fringed with gold. Here were trailing gowns, high mysteries, anguish concealed behind a smile. Next came the society of duchesses: here, one was pale; one rose at four o’clock; the women, poor angels! wore Brussels lace at the hems of their petticoats, and the men, their abilities unappreciated beneath their frivolous exteriors, rode their horses to death for the enjoyment of it, went to spend the summer season at Baden, and eventually, at about forty years of age, married heiresses. In the private 			rooms of restaurants, where one has supper after midnight, the motley crowd of literary folk and actresses would laugh by candlelight. They were as prodigal as kings, full of idealistic ambitions and delirious fantasies. Theirs was a life elevated above others, between heaven and earth, among the storm clouds, something sublime. As for the rest of the world, it was lost, without any exact place, as though it did not exist. The closer things were to her, anyway, the more her thoughts shrank from them. Everything that immediately surrounded her—the tiresome countryside, the idiotic petits bourgeois, the mediocrity of life—seemed to her an exception in the world, a particular happenstance in which she was caught, while beyond, as far as the eye could see, extended the immense land of felicity and passion. In her desire, she confused the sensual pleasures of luxury with the joys of the heart, elegance of manner with delicacy of feeling. Didn’t love, like a 			plant from India, require a prepared soil, a particular temperature? Sighs in the moonlight, long embraces, tears flowing over hands yielded to a lover, all the fevers of the flesh and the languors of tenderness thus could not be separated from the balconies of great châteaux filled with idle amusements, a boudoir with silk blinds, a good thick carpet, full pots of flowers, and a bed raised on a dais, nor from the sparkle of precious stones and shoulder knots on servants’ livery.","Paris, city vaster than the ocean, glittered before Emma’s eyes in a rosy light. But the teeming life of the tumultuous place was divided into compartments, separated into distinct scenes. Emma was aware of only two or three, which shut out the sight of the others and stood for all of mankind. In drawing rooms with mirrored walls and gleaming floors, around oval tables covered with gold-fringed velvet, moved the world of the ambassadors. It was full of trailing gowns, deep secrets, and unbearable tensions concealed beneath smiles. Then came the circle of the duchesses: here everyone was pale and lay in bed till four; the women—poor darlings!—wore English lace on their petticoat hems; and the men, their true worth unsuspected under their frivolous exteriors, rode horses to death for the fun of it, spent their summers at Baden-Baden, and eventually, when they were about forty, married heiresses. After midnight, the gay, motley world of writers and actresses congregated at candlelit suppers in the private rooms of restaurants. They were profligate as kings, full of idealistic ambitions and fantastic frenzies. They lived on a higher plane than other people, somewhere sublime between heaven and earth, up among the storm clouds. As for the rest of the world, it was in some indeterminate place beyond the pale; it could scarcely be said to exist. Indeed the closer to her things were, the further away from them her thoughts turned. Everything immediately surrounding her—boring countryside, inane petty bourgeois, the mediocrity of daily life—seemed to her the exception rather than the rule. She had been caught in it all by some accident: out beyond, there stretched as far as eye could see the immense territory of rapture and passions. In her longing she made no difference between the pleasures of luxury and the joys of the heart, between elegant living and sensitive feeling. Didn’t love, like Indian plants, require rich soils, special temperatures? Sighs in the moonlight, long embraces, hands bathed in lovers’ tears—all the fevers of the flesh and the languors of love—were inseparable from the balconies of great idle-houred castles, from a silk-curtained, thick-carpeted, beflowered boudoir with its bed on a dais, from the sparkle of precious stones and the swank of liveries."

"Cette vision splendide demeura dans sa mémoire comme la chose la plus belle qu’il fût possible de rêver ; si bien qu’à présent elle s’efforçait d’en ressaisir la sensation, qui continuait cependant, mais d’une manière moins exclusive et avec une douceur aussi profonde. Son âme, courbatue d’orgueil, se reposait enfin dans l’humilité chrétienne ; et, savourant le plaisir d’être faible, Emma contemplait en elle-même la destruction de sa volonté, qui devait faire aux envahissements de la grâce une large entrée. Il existait donc à la place du bonheur des félicités plus grandes, un autre amour au-dessus de tous les amours, sans intermittence ni fin, et qui s’accroîtrait éternellement !

She glimpsed, among the illusions of her hope, a state of purity floating above the earth, merging with the sky, and where she longed to be. She wanted to become a saint. She bought rosaries, she wore amulets; she wished to have in her room, at the bedside of her couch, a reliquary encased in emeralds, to kiss it every evening.","This splendid vision lingered in her memory as the most beautiful thing she could ever have dreamed; so that now she kept striving to recapture the sensation of it, which persisted in a less all-encompassing manner but with a sweetness as profound.

Son mari, qui était un filateur, s’emporta contre le maladroit ; et, tandis qu’avec son mouchoir elle épongeait les taches sur sa belle robe de taffetas cerise, il murmurait d’un ton bourru les mots d’indemnité, de frais, de remboursement.

"Puis ils se chauffèrent dans la cuisine, pendant qu’on apprêtait leur chambre. Charles se mit à fumer. Il fumait en avançant les lèvres, crachant à toute minute, se reculant à chaque bouffée.","Then they warmed themselves in the kitchen, while their room was being prepared. Charles began to smoke.

"À ce moment, le fiacre du Conseiller sortit de l’auberge. Son cocher, qui était ivre, s’assoupit tout à coup ; et l’on apercevait de loin, par-dessus la capote, entre les deux lanternes, la masse de son corps qui se balançait de droite et de gauche selon le tangage des soupentes.","At this moment the Counselor's cab left the inn. His coachman, who was drunk, suddenly dozed off; and one could see from afar, above the greatcoat, between the two lanterns, the mass of his body which swayed to right and left according to the pitch of the lofts.","At that moment, the Councilor’s fiacre emerged from the inn yard.

The drunken coachman chose that moment to collapse; and high above the hood, between the two lamps, everyone could see the mass of his body swaying right and left with the pitching of the springs."

"Charles descendit dans la salle, au rez-de-chaussée. Deux couverts, avec des timbales d’argent, y étaient mis sur une petite table, au pied d’un grand lit à baldaquin revêtu d’une indienne à personnages représentant des Turcs. On sentait une odeur d’iris et de draps humides, qui s’échappait de la haute armoire en bois de chêne, faisant face à la fenêtre. Par terre, dans les angles, étaient rangés, debout, des sacs de blé. C’était le trop-plein du grenier proche, où l’on montait par trois marches de pierre. Il y avait, pour décorer l’appartement, accrochée à un clou, au milieu du mur dont la peinture verte s’écaillait sous le salpêtre, une tête de Minerve au crayon noir, encadrée de dorure, et qui portait au bas, écrit en lettres gothiques : « À mon cher papa. »","Charles went down to the room, on the ground floor. Two place settings, with silver beakers, were placed there on a small table, at the foot of a large four-poster bed covered with an Indian figure representing Turks. One could smell an odor of irises and damp sheets, which escaped from the tall oak cupboard facing the window. On the floor, in the corners, were ranged, upright, sacks of wheat. It was the overflow from the nearby attic, to which one ascended by three stone steps. To decorate the apartment, hung on a nail, in the middle of the wall whose green paint was peeling off under the saltpeter, a head of Minerva in black pencil, framed in gilding, and which bore at the bottom, written in gothic letters: “To my dear papa. »","Charles went down into the parlor, on the ground floor.

This was the overflow from the nearby granary, which one reached by three stone steps.

In corners stood rows of grain sacks—the overflow from the granary, which was just adjoining, approached by three stone steps. The room’s only decoration, hanging from a nail in the center of the flaking green-painted wall, was a black pencil drawing of a head of Minerva framed in gold and inscribed at the bottom in Gothic letters “To my dear Papa.”"
Il demandait :,He asked:,He would ask:,“What others?”
"– Quel malheur donc peut-il me survenir ? Il n’y a pas de désert, pas de précipice ni d’océan que je ne traverserais avec toi.

"Alors on vit descendre du carrosse un monsieur vêtu d’un habit court à broderie d’argent, chauve sur le front, portant toupet à l’occiput, ayant le teint blafard et l’apparence des plus bénignes. Ses deux yeux, fort gros et couverts de paupières épaisses, se fermaient à demi pour considérer la multitude, en même temps qu’il levait son nez pointu et faisait sourire sa bouche rentrée. Il reconnut le maire à son écharpe, et lui exposa que M. le préfet n’avait pu venir. Il était, lui, un conseiller de préfecture ; puis il ajouta quelques excuses. Tuvache y répondit par des civilités, l’autre s’avoua confus ; et ils restaient ainsi, face à face, et leurs fronts se touchant presque, avec les membres du jury tout alentour, le conseil municipal, les notables, la garde nationale et la foule. M. le conseiller, appuyant contre sa poitrine son petit tricorne noir, réitérait ses salutations, tandis que Tuvache, courbé comme un arc, souriait aussi, bégayait, cherchait ses phrases, protestait de son dévouement à la monarchie, et de l’honneur que l’on faisait à Yonville.","Then a gentleman alighted from the carriage, dressed in a short coat with silver embroidery, bald on the forehead, with a toupee on the occiput, having a pallid complexion and the most benign appearance. His two eyes, very large and covered with thick lids, half closed to contemplate the multitude, at the same time that he raised his pointed nose and made his sunken mouth smile. He recognized the mayor by his scarf, and explained to him that the prefect had not been able to come. He was a councilor from the prefecture; then he added some excuses. Tuvache replied with civilities, the other confessed to being confused; and they remained thus, face to face, and their foreheads almost touching, with the members of the jury all around, the municipal council, the notables, the national guard and the crowd. Monsieur the Councillor, leaning his little black three-cornered hat against his bosom, repeated his greetings, while Tuvache, bent like a bow, also smiled, stammered, searched for his sentences, protested his devotion to the monarchy, and the honor that we did in Yonville.","They then saw, descending from the carriage, a gentleman dressed in a short coat embroidered in silver, bald over his forehead, his hair tufted on the crown of his head, with a pallid complexion and a most benign expression. He half closed his large, heavy-lidded eyes in order to study the crowd, at the same time lifting his sharp nose and arranging his sunken mouth into a smile. He recognized the mayor by his sash and explained to him that the prefect had been unable to come. He himself was a prefectural councilor. Then he added some excuses; Tuvache responded to these with civilities; the other confessed himself overwhelmed; and they remained thus, face-to-face, their foreheads almost touching, surrounded by the members of the jury, the town council, the local dignitaries, the national guard, and the crowd. The councilor, resting his little black tricornered hat against his chest, reiterated his salutations, while Tuvache, bent like a bow, smiled in turn, 			stammered, searched for words, protested his devotion to the monarchy and his recognition of the honor that was being bestowed on Yonville.","Then there emerged from the carriage a gentleman clad in a short, silver-embroidered coat, his forehead high and bald, the back of his head tufted, his complexion wan and his expression remarkably benign.

"Donc, il fut résolu que l’on empêcherait Emma de lire des romans. L’entreprise ne semblait point facile. La bonne dame s’en chargea : elle devait quand elle passerait par Rouen, aller en personne chez le loueur de livres et lui représenter qu’Emma cessait ses abonnements. N’aurait-on pas le droit d’avertir la police, si le libraire persistait quand même dans son métier d’empoisonneur ?","So it was resolved that Emma would be prevented from reading novels. The business did not seem easy. The good lady took care of it: when she passed through Rouen, she was to go in person to the book rental company and tell him that Emma was ceasing her subscriptions.

The project presented certain difficulties, but the old lady undertook to carry it out: on her way through Rouen she would personally call on the proprietor of the lending library and tell him that Emma was canceling her subscription.

"– À cause du changement de régime, continua le pharmacien, et de la perturbation qui en résulte dans l’économie générale. Et puis, l’eau de Paris, voyez-vous ! les mets de restaurateurs, toutes ces nourritures épicées finissent par vous échauffer le sang et ne valent pas, quoi qu’on en dise, un bon pot-au-feu. J’ai toujours, quant à moi, préféré la cuisine bourgeoise : c’est plus sain ! Aussi, lorsque j’étudiais à Rouen la pharmacie, je m’étais mis en pension dans une pension ; je mangeais avec les professeurs.","“Because of the change of diet,” continued the pharmacist, “and the consequent disturbance in the general economy. And then, the water of Paris, you see! Restaurant food, all these spicy foods end up making your blood run hot and are not worth, whatever people say, a good stew. As for me, I have always preferred home cooking: it's healthier! Also, when I was studying pharmacy in Rouen, I boarded in a boarding house; I ate with the teachers.","“Because of the change in regimen,” agreed the pharmacist, “and the resulting perturbation of the whole system. And then, you know, there’s the Paris water! And the restaurant meals, all those spicy foods that end by overheating your blood and aren’t worth as much, whatever they may say, as a good stew. I myself have always preferred home cooking: it’s healthier! For instance, when I was studying pharmacy at Rouen, I stayed in a boardinghouse; I ate with the professors.”","“Because of the change of diet,” agreed the pharmacist, “and the way it upsets the entire system. And don’t forget the Paris water! The dishes they serve in restaurants—all those spicy foods—they overheat the blood: don’t let anybody tell you they’re worth a good stew. I’ve always said there’s nothing like home cooking: it’s better for the health. That was why when I was studying pharmacy in Rouen I went to board in a boarding house: I ate where my teachers ate.”"
"Outre la compagnie de sa belle-mère, qui la raffermissait un peu par sa rectitude de jugement et ses façons graves, Emma, presque tous les jours, avait encore d’autres sociétés. C’était madame Langlois, madame Caron, madame Dubreuil, madame Tuvache et, régulièrement, de deux à cinq heures, l’excellente madame Homais, qui n’avait jamais voulu croire, celle-là, à aucun des cancans que l’on débitait sur sa voisine. Les petits Homais aussi venaient la voir ; Justin les accompagnait. Il montait avec eux dans la chambre, et il restait debout près de la porte, immobile, sans parler. Souvent même, madame Bovary, n’y prenant garde, se mettait à sa toilette. Elle commençait par retirer son peigne, en secouant sa tête d’un mouvement brusque ; et, quand il aperçut la première fois cette chevelure entière qui descendait jusqu’aux jarrets en déroulant ses anneaux noirs, ce fut pour lui, le pauvre enfant, comme l’entrée subite dans quelque chose d’extraordinaire et de nouveau dont la splendeur l’effraya.","Besides the company of her mother-in-law, who strengthened her somewhat by her rectitude of judgment and her grave manners, Emma, almost every day, had still other company.

The little Homais also came to see her; Justin accompanied them. He went up with them into the room, and he remained standing near the door, motionless, without speaking. Often even, Madame Bovary, taking no notice, began to dress. She began by removing her comb, shaking her head with a sudden movement; and, when he saw the first time this whole hair which descended to the hocks in unrolling its black rings, it was for him, the poor child, like the sudden entry into something extraordinary and new whose splendor l frightened.","Besides the company of her mother-in-law, who steadied her somewhat because of her rectitude of judgment and her sober ways, Emma also received, nearly every day, other visitors.

The Homais children would also come to see her; Justin would bring them. He would accompany them up to the bedroom, and he would remain standing by the door without moving or speaking. Often, indeed, Madame Bovary, taking no notice, would begin to dress. She would start by taking out her comb and shaking her head briskly; and the first time he saw that full mane of hair with its black ringlets tumbling down to her knees, it was for him, poor boy, like suddenly entering something new and extraordinary, something whose splendor 			frightened him.","In addition to the company of her mother-in-law, whom she found a steadying influence because of her unswerving principles and solemn demeanor, Emma nearly every day had other visits—from Madame Langlois, Madame Caron, Madame Dubreuil, Madame Tuvache, and, regularly from two to five, from Madame Homais, who—good soul that she was—had always refused to believe any of the gossip that was spread about her neighbor. The Homais children visited her, too; Justin brought them. He came with them up into her bedroom and stood quietly near the door, never saying a word. Often while he was there Madame Bovary would start to dress, oblivious of him. She would begin by taking out her comb and tossing her head; and the first time he saw her mass of black hair fall in ringlets to her knees, it was for the boy like the sudden opening of a door upon something marvelous and new, something whose splendor frightened him."

"Malgré ses airs évaporés (c’était le mot des bourgeoises d’Yonville), Emma pourtant ne paraissait pas joyeuse, et, d’habitude, elle gardait aux coins de la bouche cette immobile contraction qui plisse la figure des vieilles filles et celle des ambitieux déchus.

"Néanmoins, ne reculant pas devant ce qu’il appelait sa mission, il retourna chez Bovary en compagnie de Canivet, que M. Larivière, avant de partir, avait engagé fortement à cette démarche ; et même, sans les représentations de sa femme, il eût emmené avec lui ses deux fils, afin de les accoutumer aux fortes circonstances, pour que ce fût une leçon, un exemple, un tableau solennel qui leur restât plus tard dans la tête.","Nevertheless, not recoiling from what he called his mission, he returned to Bovary in the company of Canivet, whom M.

"Sa poitrine aussitôt se mit à haleter rapidement. La langue tout entière lui sortit hors de la bouche ; ses yeux, en roulant, pâlissaient comme deux globes de lampe qui s’éteignent, à la croire déjà morte, sans l’effrayante accélération de ses côtes, secouées par un souffle furieux, comme si l’âme eût fait des bonds pour se détacher. Félicité s’agenouilla devant le crucifix, et le pharmacien lui-même fléchit un peu les jarrets, tandis que M. Canivet regardait vaguement sur la place. Bournisien s’était remis en prière, la figure inclinée contre le bord de la couche, avec sa longue soutane noire qui traînait derrière lui dans l’appartement. Charles était de l’autre côté, à genoux, les bras étendus vers Emma. Il avait pris ses mains et il les serrait, tressaillant à chaque battement de son cœur, comme au contrecoup d’une ruine qui tombe. À mesure que le râle devenait plus fort, l’ecclésiastique précipitait ses oraisons ; elles se mêlaient aux sanglots étouffés de Bovary, et quelquefois tout semblait disparaître dans le sourd murmure des syllabes latines, qui tintaient comme un glas de cloche.","His chest immediately began to heave rapidly.

Félicité knelt down before the crucifix, and the pharmacist himself bent his knees a little, while M. Canivet gazed vaguely on the square. Bournisien had resumed his prayers, his face bent against the edge of the bed, with his long black cassock trailing behind him in the apartment. Charles was on the other side, on his knees, arms outstretched towards Emma.

As the death rattle grew louder, the ecclesiastic hurried up his prayers; they mingled with Bovary's stifled sobs, and sometimes everything seemed to disappear in the dull murmur of the Latin syllables, which rang like the tolling of a bell.","At once her chest began rising and falling rapidly.

Félicité knelt in front of the crucifix, and even the pharmacist bent a little at the knees, while Monsieur Canivet looked vaguely out at the square.

"Comme au retour de la Vaubyessard, quand les quadrilles tourbillonnaient dans sa tête, elle avait une mélancolie morne, un désespoir engourdi. Léon réapparaissait plus grand, plus beau, plus suave, plus vague ; quoiqu’il fût séparé d’elle, il ne l’avait pas quittée, il était là, et les murailles de la maison semblaient garder son ombre. Elle ne pouvait détacher sa vue de ce tapis où il avait marché, de ces meubles vides où il s’était assis. La rivière coulait toujours, et poussait lentement ses petits flots le long de la berge glissante. Ils s’y étaient promenés bien des fois, à ce même murmure des ondes, sur les cailloux couverts de mousse. Quels bons soleils ils avaient eus ! quelles bonnes après-midi, seuls, à l’ombre, dans le fond du jardin ! Il lisait tout haut, tête nue, posé sur un tabouret de bâtons secs ; le vent frais de la prairie faisait trembler les pages du livre et les capucines de la tonnelle… Ah ! il était parti, le seul charme de sa vie, le seul espoir possible d’une félicité ! Comment n’avait-elle pas saisi ce bonheur-là, quand il se présentait ! Pourquoi ne l’avoir pas retenu à deux mains, à deux genoux, quand il voulait s’enfuir ? Et elle se maudit de n’avoir pas aimé Léon ; elle eut soif de ses lèvres. L’envie la prit de courir le rejoindre, de se jeter dans ses bras, de lui dire : « C’est moi, je suis à toi ! » Mais Emma s’embarrassait d’avance aux difficultés de l’entreprise, et ses désirs, s’augmentant d’un regret, n’en devenaient que plus actifs.","As on her return from Vaubyessard, when the quadrilles swirled in her head, she had a gloomy melancholy, a numb despair. Leon reappeared taller, more handsome, more suave, more vague; although he was separated from her, he had not left her, he was there, and the walls of the house seemed to keep his shadow. She couldn't take her eyes off that rug where he had walked, those empty pieces of furniture where he had sat. The river was still flowing, and slowly pushed its small waves along the slippery bank. They had walked there many times, to the same murmur of the waves, on the pebbles covered with moss. What good suns they had had! what a good afternoon, alone, in the shade, at the bottom of the garden! He was reading aloud, bareheaded, resting on a stool of dry sticks; the fresh wind from the meadow made the pages of the book tremble and the nasturtiums of the arbor… Ah! he was gone, the only charm of his life, the only possible hope of happiness! How had she failed to grasp that happiness when it presented itself! Why didn't you hold him back with both hands, on both knees, when he wanted to run away? And she cursed herself for not having loved Leon; she thirsted for his lips. The urge seized her to run to join him, to throw herself into his arms, to say to him: “It’s me, I’m yours! But Emma embarrassed herself in advance with the difficulties of the enterprise, and her desires, increased by a regret, only became the more active.","As on her return from La Vaubyessard, when the quadrilles whirled around in her head, she was filled with a bleak melancholy, a numb despair. Léon reappeared to her, taller, handsomer, more delightful, less distinct; though gone from her, he had not left her, he was there, and the walls of the house seemed to retain his shadow. She could not take her eyes off the carpet on which he had stepped, the empty furniture on which he had sat. The river still flowed past and slowly nudged its little billows along the shining bank. They had walked there many times, accompanied by the same murmur of the waves, over the moss-covered stones. What lovely sunlight they had enjoyed! What fine afternoons, alone in the shade, at the bottom of the garden! He would read aloud, his head bare, seated on a stool made of dry sticks; the cool wind from the meadow would flutter the pages of the book and the nasturtiums in the arbor … Oh! He was 			gone— the only delight in her life, her only possible hope of happiness! Why hadn’t she seized that happiness when it was offered! Why hadn’t she held on to it with both hands, on both knees, when it tried to slip away? And she cursed herself for not having loved Léon; she thirsted for his lips. She was seized with a longing to run to him, to throw herself into his arms, to say: “Here I am, I’m yours!” But the difficulties of the undertaking discouraged Emma in advance, and her desires, increased by regret, merely became all the more urgent.","It was like the days following her return from La Vaubyessard, when the dance tunes had kept whirling in her head: she was sunk in the same mournful melancholy, the same torpid despair. Léon seemed taller, handsomer, more charming and less distinct: though he had gone, he had not left her; he was there, and the walls of her house seemed to retain his shadow. She kept staring at the rug he had walked on, the empty chairs he had sat in. The stream at the foot of her garden flowed on as usual, rippling past the slippery bank. They had often strolled there, listening to this same murmur of the water over the moss-covered stones. How they had enjoyed the sun! And the shade, too, afternoons by themselves in the garden! He had read aloud to her, bareheaded on a rustic bench, the cool wind from the meadows ruffling the pages of his book and the nasturtiums on the arbor. … And now he was gone, the one bright spot in her life, her one possible hope of happiness! Why hadn’t she grasped that good fortune when it had offered itself? And when it had first threatened to slip away—why hadn’t she seized it with both hands, implored it on her knees? She cursed herself for not having surrendered to her love for Léon: she thirsted for his lips. She was seized with a longing to run after him, to fling herself into his arms, to cry, “Take me! I’m yours!” But the difficulties of such an enterprise discouraged her in advance; and her longings, increased by regret, became all the more violent."
"La mariée avait supplié son père qu’on lui épargnât les plaisanteries d’usage. Cependant, un mareyeur de leurs cousins (qui même avait apporté, comme présent de noces, une paire de soles) commençait à souffler de l’eau avec sa bouche par le trou de la serrure, quand le père Rouault arriva juste à temps pour l’en empêcher, et lui expliqua que la position grave de son gendre ne permettait pas de telles inconvenances. Le cousin, toutefois, céda difficilement à ces raisons. En dedans de lui-même, il accusa le père Rouault d’être fier, et il alla se joindre dans un coin à quatre ou cinq autres des invités qui, ayant eu par hasard plusieurs fois de suite à table les bas morceaux des viandes, trouvaient aussi qu’on les avait mal reçus, chuchotaient sur le compte de leur hôte et souhaitaient sa ruine à mots couverts.","The bride had begged her father to be spared the usual jokes.

The cousin, however, reluctantly yielded to these reasons. Inside himself, he accused old Rouault of being proud, and he went to join in a corner four or five other guests who, having by chance had several times in a row at the table the low cuts of meat, also thought that they had been badly received, whispered about their host and wished his ruin in veiled words.","The bride had begged her father that she be spared the customary pranks.

The cousin, however, yielded only with difficulty to these arguments. Inwardly, he accused Père Rouault of being proud, and he went off into a corner to join four or five other guests who, having by chance been served the cheapest cuts of meat several times in succession at table, also felt they had been poorly treated and were whispering against their host, quietly hoping he would ruin himself.","The bride had begged her father that she be spared the usual pranks. However, a fishmonger cousin (who had actually brought a pair of soles as a wedding present) was just beginning to spurt water from his mouth through the keyhole when Rouault came along and stopped him, explaining that the importance of his son-in-law’s position didn’t permit such unseemliness. The cousin complied very grudgingly. In his heart he accused Rouault of being a snob, and he joined a group of four or five other guests, who had happened several times in succession to be given inferior cuts of meat at table and so considered that they, too, had been badly treated. The whole group sat there whispering derogatory things about their host, and in veiled language expressed hopes for his downfall."

I was stupid and mean! I love you, I will always love you!...

I enjoy a change of scene.”"
"C’était une ferme de bonne apparence. On voyait dans les écuries, par le dessus des portes ouvertes, de gros chevaux de labour qui mangeaient tranquillement dans des râteliers neufs. Le long des bâtiments s’étendait un large fumier, de la buée s’en élevait, et, parmi les poules et les dindons, picoraient dessus cinq ou six paons, luxe des basses-cours cauchoises. La bergerie était longue, la grange était haute, à murs lisses comme la main. Il y avait sous le hangar deux grandes charrettes et quatre charrues, avec leurs fouets, leurs colliers, leurs équipages complets, dont les toisons de laine bleue se salissaient à la poussière fine qui tombait des greniers. La cour allait en montant ; plantée d’arbres symétriquement espacés, et le bruit gai d’un troupeau d’oies retentissait près de la mare.","It was a good-looking farm. You could see in the stables, above the open doors, big workhorses eating quietly in new racks. Along the buildings stretched a large manure, mist rose from it, and, among the hens and turkeys, five or six peacocks pecked on it, a luxury of the barns in Cauchoise. The sheepfold was long, the barn was high, with walls smooth as a hand. There were under the shed two large carts and four plows, with their whips, their collars, their complete equipages, whose blue woolen fleeces were soiled by the fine dust which fell from the attics. The court went uphill; planted with symmetrically spaced trees, and the gay sound of a flock of geese resounded near the pond.","It was a prosperous-looking farm.

In the shed were two large carts and four plows, with their whips, their collars, their full harnesses, whose blue wool fleeces were dirtied by the fine dust that fell from the lofts.

"Cette tendresse, en effet, chaque jour s’accroissait davantage sous la répulsion du mari. Plus elle se livrait à l’un, plus elle exécrait l’autre ; jamais Charles ne lui paraissait aussi désagréable, avoir les doigts aussi carrés, l’esprit aussi lourd, les façons si communes qu’après ses rendez-vous avec Rodolphe, quand ils se trouvaient ensemble. Alors, tout en faisant l’épouse et la vertueuse, elle s’enflammait à l’idée de cette tête dont les cheveux noirs se tournaient en une boucle vers le front hâlé, de cette taille à la fois si robuste et si élégante, de cet homme enfin qui possédait tant d’expérience dans la raison, tant d’emportement dans le désir ! C’était pour lui qu’elle se limait les ongles avec un soin de ciseleur, et qu’il n’y avait jamais assez de cold-cream sur sa peau, ni de patchouli dans ses mouchoirs. Elle se chargeait de bracelets, de bagues, de colliers. Quand il devait venir, elle emplissait de roses ses deux grands vases de verre bleu, et disposait son appartement et sa personne comme une courtisane qui attend un prince. Il fallait que la domestique fût sans cesse à blanchir du linge ; et, de toute la journée, Félicité ne bougeait de la cuisine, où le petit Justin, qui souvent lui tenait compagnie, la regardait travailler.","This tenderness, in fact, increased each day more under the repulsion of the husband. The more she indulged in one, the more she hated the other; Never had Charles appeared to her so disagreeable, with such square fingers, so dull-witted, so common manners, as after his appointments with Rodolphe, when they were together. So, while pretending to be the wife and the virtuous, she was inflamed by the idea of this head whose black hair turned in a curl towards the tanned forehead, of this figure at once so robust and so elegant, of this man, finally, who possessed so much experience in reason, so much passion in desire! It was for him that she filed her nails with the care of an engraver, and that there was never enough cold-cream on her skin, nor enough patchouli in her handkerchiefs. She took care of bracelets, rings, necklaces. When he was to come, she filled her two large vases of blue glass with roses, and arranged her apartment and her person like a courtesan expecting a prince. The maid had to be constantly laundering linen; and all day Felicite did not move from the kitchen, where little Justin, who often kept her company, watched her work.","This affection, indeed, grew each day with her aversion for her husband. The more fully she gave herself to the one, the more she despised the other; Charles had never appeared to her so unpleasant, with such square fingers, such clumsy wit, such common manners, as when they happened to be together after her meetings with Rodolphe. Then, even as she played at being the wife and virtuous woman, she would become inflamed at the thought of that head with its black hair turning in a curl over the suntanned forehead, of that body at once so robust and so elegant, of that man so experienced in his judgment, so passionate in his desire! It was for him that she would file her nails with the care of an engraver, and that there was never enough cold cream on her skin, nor patchouli on her handkerchiefs. She would load herself with bracelets, rings, necklaces. When he was coming, she would fill her two large blue glass vases 			with roses, and arrange her room and herself like a courtesan waiting for a prince. The maid had to launder her linens constantly; and so all day long, Félicité would not move from the kitchen, where young Justin, who often kept her company, would watch her as she worked.","Every day her love for Rodolphe was fanned by her aversion for her husband. The more completely she surrendered to the one, the more intensely she loathed the other: never did Charles seem to her so repulsive, so thick-fingered, so heavy-witted, so common, as when she was alone with him after her meetings with Rodolphe. Acting, at such times, the role of wife, of virtuous woman, she thought feverishly of her lover—of his black hair curling over his tanned forehead, of his body so powerful and yet so elegant, of the cool judgment that went hand in hand with his fiery passion. It was for him that she filed her fingernails with the care of the most exquisite artist, that she kept massaging her skin with cold cream, scenting her handkerchiefs with patchouli. She decked herself with bracelets, rings and necklaces. Whenever he was expected she filled her two big blue glass vases with roses; both her room and herself were made ready for him, as though she were a courtesan awaiting a prince. Félicité was perpetually bleaching lingerie: all day long she was in the kitchen, and Justin often sat there with her, watching her work."

Hivert would be harnessing the horses at a leisurely pace, while listening to Mère Lefrançois, who, putting her head, in its nightcap, out a little window above, was charging him with commissions and giving him explanations that would have bewildered a different sort of man. Emma would tap the soles of her little boots on the paving stones of the courtyard.","When the clock said quarter past seven she made her way to the Lion d’Or and was let in by the yawning Artémise.

"Mais, avec cette supériorité de critique appartenant à celui qui, dans n’importe quel engagement, se tient en arrière, Rodolphe aperçut en cet amour d’autres jouissances à exploiter.

"Peu à peu, ces craintes de Rodolphe la gagnèrent. L’amour l’avait enivrée d’abord, et elle n’avait songé à rien au delà. Mais, à présent qu’il était indispensable à sa vie, elle craignait d’en perdre quelque chose, ou même qu’il ne fût troublé. Quand elle s’en revenait de chez lui, elle jetait tout alentour des regards inquiets, épiant chaque forme qui passait à l’horizon et chaque lucarne du village d’où l’on pouvait l’apercevoir. Elle écoutait les pas, les cris, le bruit des charrues ; et elle s’arrêtait plus blême et plus tremblante que les feuilles des peupliers qui se balançaient sur sa tête.","Little by little, these fears of Rodolphe won over her.

She would listen to the footsteps, the shouts, the sound of the plows; and she would stop short, paler and more tremulous than the leaves of the poplars swaying over her head.","As time went on she came to share Rodolphe’s fears. Love had intoxicated her at first, and she had had no thought beyond it.

Her ears picked up the sound of every footstep, every voice, every plough; and she would stand still, paler and more trembling than the leaves of the swaying poplars overhead."

There was Think About It; the Man of the World at the Feet of Mary, by M. de, decorated with several orders; Errors of Voltaire, for the use of young people, etc.","The curé marveled at these tendencies, although he felt that Emma’s piety might in the end, because of its fervor, verge on heresy and even nonsense. But not being very well versed in these matters once they went beyond certain bounds, he wrote to Monsieur Boulard, Monseigneur’s bookseller, to send him something particularly good, for a female of high intelligence. The bookseller, with as much indifference as if he were dispatching cheap trinkets to black Africans, packaged up a hodgepodge of everything then current in the religious book trade. Included were slim handbooks in the form of questions and answers, haughty-toned pamphlets in the manner of Monsieur de Maistre, and novels of a certain sort in pink paperboards and a sickly-sweet style fabricated by troubadour seminarists or repentant bluestockings. There was Think On It Well; The Man of the World at Mary’s Feet, 				by Monsieur de ***, decorated with many orders; The Errors of Voltaire, Intended for the Young, etc.","The priest was enchanted by her change of heart, though he was of the opinion that her faith might by its very fervor come to border on heresy and even on extravagance. But not being versed in these matters once they went beyond a certain point, he wrote Monsieur Boulard, the bishop’s bookseller, and asked him to send him “something particularly good for a lady who had a very fine mind.” As casually as though he were shipping trinkets to savages, the bookseller made up a heterogeneous package of everything just then current in the religious book trade—little question-and-answer manuals , pamphlets couched in the contemptuous language made popular by Monsieur de Maistre, so-called novels in pink bindings and sugary style concocted by romantic-minded seminarists or reformed blue-stockings. There were titles such as Think It Over Carefully; The Man of the World at the Feet of Mary, by Monsieur de—–, recipient of several decorations; The Errors of Voltaire, for the use of the young; etc."
"Enfin, pour se tenir au courant, il prit un abonnement à la Ruche médicale, journal nouveau dont il avait reçu le prospectus. Il en lisait, un peu après son dîner ; mais la chaleur de l’appartement, jointe à la digestion, faisait qu’au bout de cinq minutes il s’endormait ; et il restait là, le menton sur ses deux mains, et les cheveux étalés comme une crinière jusqu’au pied de la lampe. Emma le regardait en haussant les épaules. Que n’avait-elle, au moins, pour mari un de ces hommes d’ardeurs taciturnes qui travaillent la nuit dans les livres, et portent enfin, à soixante ans, quand vient l’âge des rhumatismes, une brochette de croix, sur leur habit noir, mal fait. Elle aurait voulu que ce nom de Bovary, qui était le sien, fût illustre, le voir étalé chez les libraires, répété dans les journaux, connu par toute la France. Mais Charles n’avait point d’ambition !

Quand Charles lui raconta, le soir, cette anecdote, Emma s’emporta bien haut contre le confrère. Charles en fut attendri. Il la baisa au front avec une larme. Mais elle était exaspérée de honte, elle avait envie de le battre, elle alla dans le corridor ouvrir la fenêtre et huma l’air frais pour se calmer.","Finally, to keep up to date, he took out a subscription to the Medical Hive, a new journal whose prospectus he had received. He was reading some a little after his dinner; but the heat of the apartment, added to the digestion, caused him to fall asleep after five minutes; and he remained there, his chin on his two hands, and his hair spreading like a mane to the foot of the lamp. Emma looked at him with a shrug. Why did she not have, at least, for husband one of those men of taciturn ardor who work at night in books, and finally wear, at sixty years of age, when the age of rheumatism comes, a skewer of crosses, on their badly made black coat. She would have liked the name of Bovary, which was hers, to be illustrious, to see it displayed in booksellers, repeated in the newspapers, known throughout France. But Charles had no ambition! A doctor from Yvetot, with whom he had lately been in consultation, had somewhat humiliated him, at the very bedside of the patient, in front of the assembled relatives. When Charles told her this anecdote that evening, Emma got very angry with her colleague. Charles was touched. He kissed her forehead with a tear. But she was exasperated with shame, she wanted to beat him, she went into the corridor to open the window and breathe in the fresh air to calm herself down.","Finally, in order to keep up to date, he took out a subscription to La Ruche Médicale, a new journal whose prospectus he had received.

Emma looked at him and shrugged her shoulders. Why didn’t she at least have for a husband one of those silent, dedicated men who spend their nights immersed in books and who by the time they’re sixty and rheumatic have acquired a row of decorations to wear on their ill-fitting black coats? She would have liked the name Bovary—her name—to be famous, on display in all the bookshops, constantly mentioned in the newspapers, known all over France. But Charles had no ambition! A doctor from Yvetot with whom he had recently held a consultation had humiliated him right at the sickbed, in front of the assembled relatives. When Charles told her the story that evening, Emma burst out furiously against the other doctor. Charles was so moved that he shed a tear and kissed her on the forehead.

"Emma, dès le vestibule, sentit tomber sur ses épaules, comme un linge humide, le froid du plâtre. Les murs étaient neufs, et les marches de bois craquèrent. Dans la chambre, au premier, un jour blanchâtre passait par les fenêtres sans rideaux.

Au milieu de l’appartement, pêle-mêle, il y avait des tiroirs de commode, des bouteilles, des tringles, des bâtons dorés avec des matelas sur des chaises et des cuvettes sur le parquet, – les deux hommes qui avaient apporté, les meubles ayant tout laissé là, négligemment.","Emma, from the vestibule, felt the coldness of the plaster fall on her shoulders, like a damp cloth.

In the middle of the apartment, pell-mell, were dresser drawers, bottles, clothes rails, gilt sticks with mattresses on chairs and basins on the floor--the two men who had brought them, the furniture having left everything there, carelessly.","As soon as she entered the front hall, Emma felt the chill from the plaster descend on her shoulders like a damp cloth.

"La Place, dès le matin, était encombrée par une file de charrettes qui, toutes à cul et les brancards en l’air, s’étendaient le long des maisons depuis l’église, jusqu’à l’auberge. De l’autre côté, il y avait des baraques de toile où l’on vendait des cotonnades, des couvertures et des bas de laine, avec des licous pour les chevaux et des paquets de rubans bleus, qui par le bout s’envolaient au vent. De la grosse quincaillerie s’étalait par terre, entre les pyramides d’œufs et les bannettes de fromages, d’où sortaient des pailles gluantes ; près des machines à blé, des poules qui gloussaient dans des cages plates passaient leurs cous par les barreaux. La foule, s’encombrant au même endroit sans en vouloir bouger, menaçait quelquefois de rompre la devanture de la pharmacie. Les mercredis, elle ne désemplissait pas et l’on s’y poussait, moins pour acheter des médicaments que pour prendre des consultations, tant était fameuse la réputation du sieur Homais dans les villages circonvoisins. Son robuste aplomb avait fasciné les campagnards. Ils le regardaient comme un plus grand médecin que tous les médecins.","The Square, from the morning, was encumbered by a line of carts which, all at their backs and stretchers in the air, stretched along the houses from the church to the inn. On the other side, there were canvas shacks where they sold cotton goods, blankets and woolen stockings, with halters for the horses and packets of blue ribbons, which at the end flew off at the wind. Heavy hardware was spread out on the floor, between the pyramids of eggs and the bunks of cheese, from which sticky straws were sticking out; near the wheat machines, clucking hens in flat cages stuck their necks through the bars. The crowd, encumbered in the same place without wanting to budge, sometimes threatened to break the front of the pharmacy. On Wednesdays, it was always full and people pushed there, less to buy medicine than to take consultations, so famous was the reputation of Mr. Homais in the surrounding villages. His robust poise had fascinated the country folk. They looked upon him as a greater physician than all physicians.","From morning on, the Square was congested with a line of carts, all tipped up with their shafts in the air, extending along the housefronts from the church to the inn.

Larger metal goods were spread over the ground, between the pyramids of eggs and the small hampers of cheeses, from which sticky pieces of straw poked out; near the threshers, clucking hens in flat cages thrust their necks through the bars. The people, crowding together in one spot and unwilling to move, at times seemed about to break the pharmacy’s front window. On Wednesdays the shop never emptied out, and people pushed their way in not so much to buy medicines as to have consultations, so celebrated was Monsieur Homais ’s reputation in the surrounding villages.

"Le père Rouault, en revenant, se mit tranquillement à fumer une pipe ; ce que Homais, dans son for intérieur, jugea peu convenable. Il remarqua de même que M. Binet s’était abstenu de paraître, que Tuvache « avait filé » après la messe, et que Théodore, le domestique du notaire, portait un habit bleu, « comme si l’on ne pouvait pas trouver un habit noir, puisque c’est l’usage, que diable ! » Et pour communiquer ses observations, il allait d’un groupe à l’autre.

"Dans l’avenue, un jour vert rabattu par le feuillage éclairait la mousse rase qui craquait doucement sous ses pieds. Le soleil se couchait ; le ciel était rouge entre les branches, et les troncs pareils des arbres plantés en ligne droite semblaient une colonnade brune se détachant sur un fond d’or ; une peur la prenait, elle appelait Djali, s’en retournait vite à Tostes par la grande route, s’affaissait dans un fauteuil, et de toute la soirée ne parlait pas.","In the avenue, a green day beaten down by the foliage lit up the short moss which creaked softly under his feet.

"La conversation fut languissante, madame Bovary l’abandonnant à chaque minute, tandis qu’il demeurait lui-même comme tout embarrassé.

"Lorsqu’il s’aperçut donc que Charles avait les pommettes rouges près de sa fille, ce qui signifiait qu’un de ces jours on la lui demanderait en mariage, il rumina d’avance toute l’affaire. Il le trouvait bien un peu gringalet, et ce n’était pas là un gendre comme il l’eût souhaité ; mais on le disait de bonne conduite, économe, fort instruit, et sans doute qu’il ne chicanerait pas trop sur la dot. Or, comme le père Rouault allait être forcé de vendre vingt-deux acres de son bien, qu’il devait beaucoup au maçon, beaucoup au bourrelier, que l’arbre du pressoir était à remettre :","So when he noticed that Charles had red cheekbones near his daughter, which meant that one of these days she would be asked to marry him, he brooded over the whole affair in advance. He found him a little weakling, and he was not the son-in-law he would have liked; but he was said to be of good conduct, thrifty, well-informed, and doubtless that he would not quibble too much about the dowry. Now, as Father Rouault was about to be forced to sell twenty-two acres of his property, as he owed a lot to the mason, a lot to the saddler, and the shaft of the press had to be handed over:","And so when he noticed that Charles’s cheeks turned red in the presence of his daughter, which meant that one of these days Charles would ask for her hand in marriage, he pondered the whole matter in advance. He certainly found him a little puny, and this wasn’t the sort of son-in-law he would have wished for; but he was said to be sober in his habits, thrifty, well educated, and he would probably not haggle too much over the dowry. Therefore, since Père Rouault was going to be forced to sell twenty-two acres of his property, since he owed a good deal to the mason, a good deal to the harness maker, since the shaft of the press needed to be repaired:","So when he noticed that Charles tended to be flushed in his daughter’s presence—meaning that one of these days he would ask for her hand—he pondered every aspect of the question well in advance. Charles was a bit namby-pamby, not his dream of a son-in-law; but he was said to be reliable, thrifty, very well educated; and he probably wouldn’t haggle too much over the dowry. Moreover, Rouault was soon going to have to sell twenty-two of his acres: he owed considerable to the mason and considerable to the harness-maker, and the cider press needed a new shaft."

So that evening, on recognizing Madame Bovary in L'Hirondelle, the cure told her of his embarrassment, without seeming to attach any importance to it; for he began the eulogy of a preacher who at that time was doing wonders at the cathedral, and whom all the ladies ran to hear.","One morning when she had just set off, as was her habit, rather lightly dressed, there was a sudden snowfall; and as Charles was watching the weather out the window, he caught sight of Monsieur Bournisien in the boc belonging to Sieur Tuvache, who was driving him to Rouen. So he went downstairs to entrust the clergyman with a thick shawl so that he might deliver it to Madame, as soon as he should reach the Croix Rouge. Scarcely had he arrived at the inn than Bournisien asked where the wife of the Yonville doctor was. The hotel keeper answered that she spent very little time at her establishment. And so, that evening, when he recognized Madame Bovary in the Hirondelle, the curé told her about his difficulty, without appearing, however, to attach any importance to it; for he commenced singing the praises of a preacher who at that time was performing wonders in the cathedral and whom all the ladies 			were rushing to hear.","One morning just after she had gone, rather lightly clad as usual, there was a sudden snowfall; and Charles, looking out the window at the weather, saw Monsieur Bournisien setting out for Rouen in Monsieur Tuvache’s buggy. So he ran down with a heavy shawl and asked the priest to give it to Madame as soon as he got to the Croix-Rouge. The moment he reached the inn, Bournisien asked where the wife of the Yonville doctor was. The hotel-keeper replied that she spent very little time there. That evening, therefore, finding Madame Bovary in the Hirondelle, the curé told her of the contretemps: he seemd to attach little importance to it, however, for he launched into praise of a preacher, the sensation at the cathedral, adored by all the ladies."

"C’était par un beau matin d’été. Des argenteries reluisaient aux boutiques des orfèvres, et la lumière qui arrivait obliquement sur la cathédrale posait des miroitements à la cassure des pierres grises ; une compagnie d’oiseaux tourbillonnaient dans le ciel bleu, autour des clochetons à trèfles ; la place, retentissante de cris, sentait les fleurs qui bordaient son pavé, roses, jasmins, œillets, narcisses et tubéreuses, espacés inégalement par des verdures humides, de l’herbe-au-chat et du mouron pour les oiseaux ; la fontaine, au milieu, gargouillait, et, sous de larges parapluies, parmi des cantaloups s’étageant en pyramides, des marchandes, nu-tête, tournaient dans du papier des bouquets de violettes.","It was a beautiful summer morning.

"Avec beaucoup de précautions, pour ne pas déranger la position du membre, on retira donc la boîte, et l’on vit un spectacle affreux. Les formes du pied disparaissaient dans une telle bouffissure, que la peau tout entière semblait près de se rompre, et elle était couverte d’ecchymoses occasionnées par la fameuse machine. Hippolyte déjà s’était plaint d’en souffrir ; on n’y avait pris garde ; il fallut reconnaître qu’il n’avait pas eu tort complètement ; et on le laissa libre quelques heures. Mais à peine l’œdème eut-il un peu disparu, que les deux savants jugèrent à propos de rétablir le membre dans l’appareil, et en l’y serrant davantage, pour accélérer les choses. Enfin, trois jours après, Hippolyte n’y pouvant plus tenir, ils retirèrent encore une fois la mécanique, tout en s’étonnant beaucoup du résultat qu’ils aperçurent. Une tuméfaction livide s’étendait sur la jambe, et avec des phlyctènes de place en place, par où suintait un liquide noir. Cela prenait une tournure sérieuse. Hippolyte commençait à s’ennuyer, et la mère Lefrançois l’installa dans la petite salle, près de la cuisine, pour qu’il eût au moins quelque distraction.","With great care, so as not to disturb the position of the limb, the box was therefore withdrawn, and a dreadful sight was seen. The shapes of the foot disappeared in such a puffiness that the whole skin seemed ready to break, and it was covered with bruises caused by the famous machine. Hippolyte had already complained of suffering from it; no one took notice; it had to be admitted that he had not been completely wrong; and they left him free for a few hours. But no sooner had the edema disappeared than the two scientists thought fit to re-establish the member in the appliance, and tightening it more, to speed things up. Finally, three days later, Hippolyte being unable to bear it any longer, they withdrew the mechanism once again, while being very surprised at the result they saw. A livid swelling extended over the leg, and with blisters here and there, from which oozed a black liquid. It was taking a serious turn. Hippolyte was beginning to get bored, and Mother Lefrançois installed him in the little room, near the kitchen, so that he had at least some distraction.","With many precautions so as not to disturb the position of the leg, they therefore removed the box, and a horrifying sight met their eyes. The shape of the foot had disappeared within a swelling so extreme that the skin seemed about to split, and the entire surface was covered with ecchymoses caused by the much-vaunted machine. Hippolyte had complained before this that it was hurting him; no one had paid any attention; they had to admit he had not been entirely wrong; and they left him free for a few hours. But scarcely had the edema gone down a little than the two experts deemed it advisable to return the limb to the apparatus, tightening it further in order to speed things up. At last, three days later, Hippolyte being unable to endure it any longer, they removed the contrivance again, and were quite astonished at the result they observed. A livid tumefaction was now spreading up the leg, with phlyctenae here and there from which a black liquid was seeping 			out. Things were taking a serious turn. Hippolyte was becoming despondent, and Mère Lefrançois moved him into the small parlor, next to the kitchen, so that he would at least have some distraction.","Taking every precaution not to disturb the position of the leg, Charles and Monsieur Homais removed the box—and a terrible sight met their eyes. The foot was completely formless, so immensely swollen that the skin seemed ready to burst; and the entire surface was covered with black and blue spots caused by the much-vaunted apparatus. Hippolyte had been complaining of pain for some time, but no one had paid any attention; now it was clear that he hadn’t entirely imagined it, and he was allowed to keep his foot out of the box for several hours. But hardly had the swelling subsided a little than the two experts decided that the treatment should be resumed; and they screwed the apparatus on more tightly than before, to hasten results. Finally, three days later, when Hippolyte could bear it no longer, they removed the box again and were amazed by what they saw. A livid tumescence now extended up the leg, and a dark liquid was oozing from a number of blood blisters. Things were taking a serious turn. Hippolyte had no courage left; and Madame Lefrançois moved him into the small room, just off the kitchen, so that he might at least have some distraction."

"Le soir, en s’en retournant, Charles reprit une à une les phrases qu’elle avait dites, tâchant de se les rappeler, d’en compléter le sens, afin de se faire la portion d’existence qu’elle avait vécu dans le temps qu’il ne la connaissait pas encore. Mais jamais il ne put la voir en sa pensée, différemment qu’il ne l’avait vue la première fois, ou telle qu’il venait de la quitter tout à l’heure. Puis il se demanda ce qu’elle deviendrait, si elle se marierait, et à qui ? hélas ! le père Rouault était bien riche, et elle !… si belle ! Mais la figure d’Emma revenait toujours se placer devant ses yeux, et quelque chose de monotone comme le ronflement d’une toupie bourdonnait à ses oreilles : « Si tu te mariais, pourtant ! si tu te mariais ! » La nuit, il ne dormit pas, sa gorge était serrée, il avait soif ; il se leva pour aller boire à son pot à l’eau et il ouvrit la fenêtre ; le ciel était couvert d’étoiles, un vent chaud passait, au loin des chiens aboyaient. Il tourna la tête du côté des Bertaux.","In the evening, when he returned, Charles took up the sentences she had said one by one, trying to remember them, to complete their meaning, in order to make up for himself the portion of existence that she had lived in the time he did not know her yet. But he was never able to see her in his thoughts, differently than he had seen her the first time, or as he had just left her. Then he wondered what would become of her, if she would marry, and to whom? alas! Father Rouault was very rich, and she!... so beautiful! But Emma's face always came back to stand before her eyes, and something monotonous like the hum of a spinning top buzzed in her ears: ""If you were getting married, however!"" if you got married! At night he did not sleep, his throat was tight, he was thirsty; he got up to go and drink from his water jug and he opened the window; the sky was covered with stars, a warm wind was blowing, in the distance dogs were barking. He turned his head in the direction of the Bertaux.","That evening, as he was returning home, Charles took up again one by one the words she had used, trying to recall them, to complete their meaning, in order to re-create for himself the portion of her life that she had lived during the time when he did not yet know her.

Then he wondered what would become of her, whether she would marry, and whom. Alas! Père Rouault was very rich, and she! … so lovely! But Emma’s face kept returning to linger before his eyes, and something monotonous like the drone of a top kept buzzing in his ears: “But what if you were to get married!

He turned his face toward Les Bertaux.","That evening, on his homeward ride, Charles went over one by one the things she had said, trying to remember her exact words and sense their implications, in an effort to picture what her life had been like before their meeting. But in his thoughts he could never see her any differently from the way she had been when he had seen her the first time, or as she had been just now, when he left her. Then he wondered what would become of her, whether she would marry, and whom. Alas! Monsieur Rouault was very rich, and she … so beautiful!

"N’avaient-ils rien autre chose à se dire ? Leurs yeux pourtant étaient pleins d’une causerie plus sérieuse ; et, tandis qu’ils s’efforçaient à trouver des phrases banales, ils sentaient une même langueur les envahir tous les deux ; c’était comme un murmure de l’âme, profond, continu, qui dominait celui des voix. Surpris d’étonnement à cette suavité nouvelle, ils ne songeaient pas à s’en raconter la sensation ou à en découvrir la cause. Les bonheurs futurs, comme les rivages des tropiques, projettent sur l’immensité qui les précède leurs mollesses natales, une brise parfumée, et l’on s’assoupit dans cet enivrement sans même s’inquiéter de l’horizon que l’on n’aperçoit pas.","Didn't they have anything else to say to each other? Their eyes, however, were full of a more serious conversation; and, as they struggled to find banal phrases, they felt the same languor invade them both; it was like a murmur of the soul, deep, continuous, which dominated that of the voices. Surprised with astonishment at this new sweetness, they did not dream of telling each other its sensation or discovering its cause.

Surprised by a sweetness new to them, they did not think of describing the sensation to each other or of discovering its cause. Future joys, like tropical shores, project over the immensity that lies before them their native softness, a fragrant breeze, and one grows drowsy in that intoxication without even worrying about the horizon one cannot see.","Had they nothing more to say to each other?

"Enfin, Emma se souvint qu’au château de la Vaubyessard elle avait entendu la marquise appeler Berthe une jeune femme ; dès lors ce nom-là fut choisi, et, comme le père Rouault ne pouvait venir, on pria M. Homais d’être parrain. Il donna pour cadeaux tous produits de son établissement, à savoir : six boîtes de jujubes, un bocal entier de racahout, trois coffins de pâte à la guimauve, et, de plus, six bâtons de sucre candi qu’il avait retrouvés dans un placard. Le soir de la cérémonie, il y eut un grand dîner ; le curé s’y trouvait ; on s’échauffa. M. Homais, vers les liqueurs, entonna le Dieu des bonnes gens. M. Léon chanta une barcarolle, et madame Bovary mère, qui était la marraine, une romance du temps de l’Empire ; enfin M. Bovary père exigea que l’on descendît l’enfant, et se mit à le baptiser avec un verre de champagne qu’il lui versait de haut sur la tête. Cette dérision du premier des sacrements indigna l’abbé Bournisien ; le père Bovary répondit par une citation de la Guerre des dieux, le curé voulut partir ; les dames suppliaient ; Homais s’interposa ; et l’on parvint à faire rasseoir l’ecclésiastique, qui reprit tranquillement, dans sa soucoupe, sa demi-tasse de café à moitié bue.","Finally, Emma remembered that at the Château de la Vaubyessard she had heard the marquise call Berthe a young woman; from then on that name was chosen, and as Father Rouault could not come, M. Homais was asked to be godfather. He gave as gifts all the products of his establishment, namely: six boxes of jelly beans, an entire jar of racahout, three coffins of marshmallow paste, and, in addition, six sticks of candy sugar which he had found in a cupboard. . On the evening of the ceremony, there was a big dinner; the priest was there; we warmed up. M. Homais, towards the liquors, intoned the God of good people. M. Léon sang a barcarolle, and Madame Bovary senior, who was the godmother, a ballad from the time of the Empire; finally M. Bovary senior demanded that the child be lowered, and began to baptize him with a glass of champagne which he poured from above on his head. This derision of the first of the sacraments indignant the Abbé Bournisien; Father Bovary replied with a quotation from The War of the Gods, the priest wanted to leave; the ladies begged; Homais intervened; and they managed to get the ecclesiastic to sit down again, and he calmly took back his half-drunk half-cup of coffee from his saucer.","At last, Emma remembered that at the La Vaubyessard château she had heard the marquise address a young woman as Berthe; from that moment, the name was decided, and since Père Rouault could not come, they asked Monsieur Homais to be godfather. The gifts he gave were all products of his establishment, namely, six boxes of jujubes, a whole jar of racahout, three pans of marshmallow paste, and, in addition, six sticks of sugar candy that he had found in a cupboard. The evening of the ceremony, there was a large dinner; the curé was there; the company became excited. Over the liqueurs, Monsieur Homais intoned “The God of Good Folks.” Monsieur Léon sang a barcarolle, and the elder Madame Bovary, who was godmother, a romantic ballad from the time of the Empire; finally the elder Monsieur Bovary demanded that the child be brought downstairs, and he proceeded to baptize her with a glass of Champagne, pouring it over her head from above. 			 This mockery of the first sacrament filled the Abbé Bournisien with indignation; Père Bovary responded with a quotation from “The War of the Gods,” and the curé tried to leave; the ladies pleaded; Homais intervened; and they succeeded in getting the clergyman to return to his seat, where he tranquilly picked up from his saucer his half-drunk demitasse of coffee.","In the end, Emma remembered hearing the marquise at Vaubyessard address a young woman as Berthe, and that promptly became the chosen name. Since Monsieur Rouault was unable to come, Monsieur Homais was asked to be godfather. As presents he brought several items from his pharmaceutical stock, namely, six boxes of jujubes, a full jar of racahout, three packages of marshmallow paste, and six sticks of sugar candy that he found in a cupboard and threw in for good measure. The evening of the ceremony there was a large dinner party. The priest was present: words became rather heated, and with the liqueurs Monsieur Homais broke into Béranger’s Le Dien des bonnes gens. Monsieur Léon sang a barcarolle, and the older Madame Bovary (who was godmother) a Napoleonic ballad. Finally the older Monsieur Bovary insisted that the baby be brought down, and proceeded to baptise it with a glass of champagne, pouring the wine over its head. This mockery of the first sacrament brought indignant words from the Abbé Bournisien; the older Monsieur Bovary replied with a quotation from La Guerre des dieux; and the priest started to leave. The ladies implored him to stay; Homais intervened; and after considerable persuasion the abbé sat down again in his chair and calmly took up his saucer and his half-finished demitasse."

"Donc, elle reporta sur lui seul la haine nombreuse qui résultait de ses ennuis, et chaque effort pour l’amoindrir ne servait qu’à l’augmenter ; car cette peine inutile s’ajoutait aux autres motifs de désespoir et contribuait encore plus à l’écartement. Sa propre douceur à elle-même lui donnait des rébellions. La médiocrité domestique la poussait à des fantaisies luxueuses, la tendresse matrimoniale en des désirs adultères. Elle aurait voulu que Charles la battît, pour pouvoir plus justement le détester, s’en venger.

She would have liked Charles to beat her, so that she could more justly hate him, take revenge. She was sometimes astonished at the atrocious conjectures which occurred to her; and you had to keep smiling, hear yourself repeat that she was happy, pretend to be, let believe it!","And so she directed at him alone the manifold hatred born of her troubles, and every attempt she made to diminish that hatred only increased it; for her useless effort gave her yet another reason for despair and contributed even more to her estrangement from him.

She wished that Charles would beat her: then she would feel more justified in hating him and betraying him out of revenge.

Les oreilles du pharmacien lui tintèrent à croire qu’il allait tomber d’un coup de sang ; il entrevit des culs de basse-fosse, sa famille en pleurs, la pharmacie vendue, tous les bocaux disséminés ; et il fut obligé d’entrer dans un café prendre un verre de rhum avec de l’eau de Seltz, pour se remettre les esprits.","He had broken the law of 19 Ventôse year XI, article I, which prohibits any individual without a diploma from practicing medicine; so that, on dark denunciations, Homais had been summoned to Rouen, near the king's attorney, to his private office.

In the corridor you could hear the heavy boots of the gendarmes passing, and, like a distant noise, great locks closing.

People even said, because of this: “Ah! Monsieur Canivet—what a character!” And he was all the more respected for his unshakable self-possession. The universe might have perished down to the last man, and he would not have neglected the least of his habits.","The doctor drew up in the hotel yard with a flourish and called loudly for someone to unharness his mare; and then he went to the stable to see whether she was really being given oats as he had ordered. His first concern, whenever he arrived at a patient’s, was always for his mare and his gig. “That Canivet—he’s a character!” people said of him; and they thought the more of him for his unshakable self-assurance. The universe might have perished to the last man, and he wouldn’t have altered his habits a jot."

"Lorsque le moment fut venu des embrassades, madame Homais pleura ; Justin sanglotait ; Homais, en homme fort, dissimula son émotion ; il voulut lui-même porter le paletot de son ami jusqu’à la grille du notaire, qui emmenait Léon à Rouen dans sa voiture. Ce dernier avait juste le temps de faire ses adieux à M. Bovary.","When the time came for an embrace, Madame Homais wept; Justin was sobbing; Homais, like a strong man, concealed his emotion; he wanted to carry his friend's overcoat himself to the gate of the notary, who was taking Léon to Rouen in his carriage. The latter had just enough time to bid farewell to Mr. Bovary.","When the moment came for the farewell embraces, Madame Homais wept; Justin sobbed; Homais, as befitted a strong man, concealed his emotion; he insisted on personally carrying his friend’s overcoat to the notary’s gate; the latter was to take Léon to Rouen in his carriage. The clerk had just enough time to say his goodbyes to Monsieur Bovary.","When the moment came for farewells, Madame Homais wept and Justin sobbed. Homais hid his emotion as a strong man should, and insisted on carrying his friend’s overcoat as far as the notary’s. Maître Guillaumin was to drive Léon to Rouen in his carriage. There was just time to say good-bye to Monsieur Bovary."
"Que faire ?… C’était dans vingt-quatre heures ; demain ! Lheureux, pensa-t-elle, voulait sans doute l’effrayer encore ; car elle devina du coup toutes ses manœuvres, le but de ses complaisances. Ce qui la rassurait, c’était l’exagération même de la somme.","What to do?… It was in twenty-four hours; tomorrow ! Lheureux, she thought, must have wanted to frighten her again; for she guessed at once all his maneuvers, the object of his complacency. What reassured her was the very exaggeration of the sum.","What was she to do? … Within twenty-four hours; tomorrow! Lheureux, she thought, no doubt wanted to frighten her again; for she suddenly understood all his maneuvers, the purpose behind his obliging manner. What reassured her was the very exaggeration of the sum.","What was to be done? In twenty-four hours: tomorrow! Lheureux, she thought, was probably trying to frighten her again. Suddenly she saw through all his schemes; the reason for his amiability burst upon her. What reassured her was the very enormity of the amount."

"Bovary commanda donc d’apporter une bande et une cuvette, et pria Justin de la soutenir. Puis, s’adressant au villageois déjà blême :","Bovary therefore ordered a bandage and a basin to be brought, and begged Justin to support her.

– Crois-tu m’avoir pris vierge ? exclamait-il en riant.,"""Do you think you took me a virgin?"" he exclaimed, laughing.","“Do you think I was a virgin when you met me?” he would exclaim, laughing.","That made him laugh: “Do you think you deflowered me?” When Emma burst into tears he tried to comfort her, protesting his love and saying things to make her smile."
"Lheureux n’en continua pas moins sa besogne, aidé par une jeune fille de treize ans environ, un peu bossue, et qui lui servait à la fois de commis et de cuisinière.","Lheureux none the less continued his work, aided by a young girl of about thirteen, a little hunchbacked, and who served him both as clerk and as cook.","Yet Lheureux went on with his task, helped by a slightly hunchbacked girl of about thirteen, who served him as both shop assistant and cook.","He didn’t interrupt his task: his clerk, a slightly hunch-backed girl of thirteen or so, who also did his cooking, was helping him."
"Dès lors, ce souvenir de Léon fut comme le centre de son ennui ; il y pétillait plus fort que, dans un steppe de Russie, un feu de voyageurs abandonné sur la neige. Elle se précipitait vers lui, elle se blottissait contre, elle remuait délicatement ce foyer près de s’éteindre, elle allait cherchant tout autour d’elle ce qui pouvait l’aviver davantage ; et les réminiscences les plus lointaines comme les plus immédiates occasions, ce qu’elle éprouvait avec ce qu’elle imaginait, ses envies de volupté qui se dispersaient, ses projets de bonheur qui craquaient au vent comme des branchages morts, sa vertu stérile, ses espérances tombées, la litière domestique, elle ramassait tout, prenait tout, et faisait servir tout à réchauffer sa tristesse.","From then on, this memory of Leon was like the center of his boredom; it sparkled there more than, in a Russian steppe, a travelers' fire abandoned on the snow. She rushed towards him, she snuggled up against him, she delicately moved this hearth which was about to be extinguished, she went looking all around her for anything that could enliven it more; and the most distant reminiscences as well as the most immediate occasions, what she felt with what she imagined, her cravings for pleasure which dispersed, her projects of happiness which crackled in the wind like dead branches, her sterile virtue, her hopes dashed, the household litter, she picked up everything, took everything, and made everything serve to warm up her sadness.","From then on, the memory of Léon occupied the center of her feeling of weariness; there it sparkled more brightly than a fire abandoned by travelers on the snow of a Russian steppe. She would rush up to it, she would crouch down next to it, she would delicately stir its embers, so close to dying out, she would look all around for something that could revive it; and the most distant memories, as well as the most recent events, what she was feeling and what she was imagining, her sensuous desires, which were dissipating, her plans for happiness, which were cracking in the wind like dead branches, her sterile virtue, her disappointed hopes, the litter of her domestic life—she gathered all of it up, took it, and used it to rekindle her sadness.","Thereafter, the image she had of Léon became the center of her distress: it glowed more brightly than a travelers’ fire left burning on the snow of a Russian steppe. She ran up to it, crouched beside it, stirred it carefully when it was on the verge of extinction, grasped at everything within reach that might bring it back to life. Distant memories and present-day events, experiences actual and imagined, her starved sensuality, her plans for happiness, blown down like dead branches in the wind, her barren “virtue,” the collapse of her hopes, the litter of her domestic life—all these she gathered up and used as fuel for her misery."
– Eh ! qu’importe ?,– Hey! what does it matter?,“Oh! What does it matter?”,"“Ah, never mind …”"
"Elle semblait déterminée à le laisser parler sans l’interrompre. Croisant les bras et baissant la figure, elle considérait la rosette de ses pantoufles, et elle faisait dans leur satin de petits mouvements, par intervalles, avec les doigts de son pied.","She seemed determined to let him speak without interrupting him. Crossing her arms and lowering her face, she gazed at the rosette of her slippers, and she made little movements in their satin, at intervals, with the toes of her foot.","She seemed determined to let him talk without interrupting him.

"Le festin fut long, bruyant, mal servi ; l’on était si tassé, que l’on avait peine à remuer les coudes, et les planches étroites qui servaient de bancs faillirent se rompre sous le poids des convives.

Il rêvait à ce qu’elle avait dit et à la forme de ses lèvres ; sa figure, comme en un miroir magique, brillait sur la plaque des shakos ; les plis de sa robe descendaient le long des murs, et des journées d’amour se déroulaient à l’infini dans les perspectives de l’avenir.","The feast was long, noisy, badly served; they were so crowded together that it was hard to move their elbows, and the narrow planks which served as benches almost broke under the weight of the guests.

Rodolphe, leaning his back against the calico of the tent, was thinking so hard of Emma that he heard nothing. Behind him, on the lawn, servants were piling up dirty plates; his neighbors were talking, he did not answer them; they filled his glass, and a silence settled over his thoughts, in spite of the increasing noise. He dreamed of what she had said and the shape of her lips; his face, as in a magic mirror, shone on the plate of the shakos; the folds of her dress ran down the walls, and days of love unfolded endlessly in the prospect of the future.","The feast was long, noisy, badly served; they were packed in together so tightly they had trouble moving their elbows, and the narrow boards that served as benches nearly broke under the weight of the guests.

All the memories and thoughts in her mind poured out at once, like a thousand fireworks. She saw her father, Lheureux’s office, their room in Rouen, another landscape. Madness began to take hold of her; she was frightened, but managed to control herself—without, however, emerging from her confusion, for the cause of her horrible state—the question of money—had faded from her mind. It was only her love that was making her suffer, and she felt her soul leave her at the thought—just as a wounded man, as he lies dying, feels his life flowing out with his blood through the gaping hole."

"Le tiède appartement, avec son tapis discret, ses ornements folâtres et sa lumière tranquille, semblait tout commode pour les intimités de la passion.

"Par peur d’être vue, elle ne prenait pas ordinairement le chemin le plus court. Elle s’engouffrait dans les ruelles sombres, et elle arrivait tout en sueur vers le bas de la rue Nationale, près de la fontaine qui est là. C’est le quartier du théâtre, des estaminets et des filles. Souvent une charrette passait près d’elle, portant quelque décor qui tremblait.

"Sa femme avait été folle de lui autrefois ; elle l’avait aimé avec mille servilités qui l’avaient détaché d’elle encore davantage. Enjouée jadis, expansive et tout aimante, elle était, en vieillissant, devenue (à la façon du vin éventé qui se tourne en vinaigre) d’humeur difficile, piaillarde, nerveuse. Elle avait tant souffert, sans se plaindre, d’abord, quand elle le voyait courir après toutes les gotons de village et que vingt mauvais lieux le lui renvoyaient le soir, blasé et puant l’ivresse ! Puis l’orgueil s’était révolté. Alors elle s’était tue, avalant sa rage dans un stoïcisme muet, qu’elle garda jusqu’à sa mort. Elle était sans cesse en courses, en affaires. Elle allait chez les avoués, chez le président, se rappelait l’échéance des billets, obtenait des retards ; et, à la maison, repassait, cousait, blanchissait, surveillait les ouvriers, soldait les mémoires, tandis que, sans s’inquiéter de rien, Monsieur, continuellement engourdi dans une somnolence boudeuse dont il ne se réveillait que pour lui dire des choses désobligeantes, restait à fumer au coin du feu, en crachant dans les cendres.","His wife had once been mad about him; she had loved him with a thousand servilities which had detached him from her even more.

Then pride revolted. So she was silent, swallowing her rage in a mute stoicism, which she kept until her death. She was constantly on the run, on business. She went to the lawyers, to the president, remembered the expiry of the tickets, got delays; and, at home, ironed, sewed, washed, watched the workmen, sold the memoirs, while, without worrying about anything, Monsieur, continually numb in a sulky drowsiness from which he awoke only to say unkind things to her , stood smoking by the fire, spitting in the ashes.","His wife had been madly in love with him at one time; she had doted on him with countless slavish attentions that had estranged him from her even further.

She had suffered so much, without complaining at first, when she saw him running after every slut in the village and when a score of low-life places would send him back to her at night surfeited and stinking drunk! Then her pride had rebelled. She fell silent, swallowing her rage in a mute stoicism, which she maintained until her death. She was constantly out on errands, on business. She would go see the lawyers, the presiding judge, remember the due dates of the notes, obtain extensions; and, at home, she would iron, sew, wash, look after the workers, settle the accounts, while Monsieur, troubling himself about nothing, eternally sunk in a sullen 			torpor from which he roused himself only to say unpleasant things to her, sat smoking by the fire, spitting in the ashes.","His wife had been mad about him at the beginning; in her love she had tendered him a thousand servilities that had alienated him all the more.

Then her pride rebelled. She withdrew into her shell; and swallowing her rage she bore up stoically until her death. She was always busy, always doing things. She was constantly running to lawyers, to the judge, remembering when notes fell due and obtaining renewals; and at home she was forever ironing, sewing, washing, keeping an eye on the hired men, figuring their wages. Monsieur, meanwhile, never lifted a finger. He sat smoking in the chimney corner and spitting into the ashes, continually falling into a grumpy doze and waking to utter uncomplimentary remarks."

"Accoudé en face de lui, il mâchait son cigare tout en causant, et Charles se perdait en rêveries devant cette figure qu’elle avait aimée. Il lui semblait revoir quelque chose d’elle.

"Elle sortit, elle traversa le boulevard, la place Cauchoise et le faubourg, jusqu’à une rue découverte qui dominait des jardins. Elle marchait vite, le grand air la calmait : et peu à peu les figures de la foule, les masques, les quadrilles, les lustres, le souper, ces femmes, tout disparaissait comme des brumes emportées.

"Au choc imprévu de cette phrase tombant sur sa pensée comme une balle de plomb clins un plat d’argent, Emma tressaillant leva la tête pour deviner ce qu’il voulait dire ; et ils se regardèrent silencieusement, presque ébahis de se voir, tant ils étaient par leur conscience éloignés l’un de l’autre. Charles la considérait avec le regard trouble d’un homme ivre, tout en écoutant, immobile, les derniers cris de l’amputé qui se suivaient en modulations traînantes, coupées de saccades aiguës, comme le hurlement lointain de quelque bête qu’on égorge. Emma mordait ses lèvres blêmes, et, roulant entre ses doigts un des brins du polypier qu’elle avait cassé, elle fixait sur Charles la pointe ardente de ses prunelles, comme deux flèches de feu prêtes à partir. Tout en lui l’irritait maintenant, sa figure, son costume, ce qu’il ne disait pas, sa personne entière, son existence enfin. Elle se repentait, comme d’un crime, de sa vertu passée, et ce qui en restait encore s’écroulait sous les coups furieux de son orgueil. Elle se délectait dans toutes les ironies mauvaises de l’adultère triomphant. Le souvenir de son amant revenait à elle avec des attractions vertigineuses : elle y jetait son âme, emportée vers cette image par un enthousiasme nouveau ; et Charles lui semblait aussi détaché de sa vie, aussi absent pour toujours, aussi impossible et anéanti, que s’il allait mourir et qu’il eût agonisé sous ses yeux.","At the unexpected shock of this sentence falling on his mind like a leaden ball against a silver platter, Emma, startling, raised her head to guess what he meant; and they looked at each other silently, almost amazed to see each other, so distant were they in their conscience from each other. Charles gazed at her with the troubled gaze of a drunken man, while he listened, motionless, to the last cries of the amputee which followed each other in drawling modulations, broken by sharp jerks, like the distant howl of some beast being slaughtered. Emma bit her pale lips, and, rolling between her fingers one of the sprigs of the polypary she had broken, she fixed the burning point of her pupils on Charles, like two arrows of fire ready to shoot. Everything about him irritated her now, his face, his costume, what he did not say, his whole person, his existence in short. She repented, as of a crime, of her past virtue, and what still remained of it crumbled under the furious blows of her pride. She reveled in all the evil ironies of triumphant adultery. The memory of her lover came back to her with dizzying attractions: she threw her soul into it, carried away towards this image by a new enthusiasm; and Charles seemed to her as detached from her life, as forever absent, as impossible and annihilated, as if he were about to die and had been dying before her eyes.","At the unexpected shock of that sentence falling upon her thoughts like a lead ball on a silver plate, Emma, with a shudder, lifted her head to try to understand what he meant; and they looked at each other in silence, almost dumbfounded to see each other there, so far apart had their thoughts taken them. Charles was contemplating her with the clouded gaze of a drunken man, even as he listened, motionless, to the amputee’s last cries, which followed one another in lingering modulations punctuated by sharp shrieks, like the howling of some animal whose throat is being cut in the distance. Emma was biting her pale lips, and, as she rolled in her fingers one of the fragments of coral she had broken off, she fastened on Charles the burning points of her eyes, like two arrows of fire about to be loosed. Everything about him irritated her now— his face, his clothes, what he was not saying, his entire person, his very existence. She repented her past 			virtue as though it had been a crime, and what remained of it crumbled under the furious blows of her pride. She relished all the wretched ironies of triumphant adultery. The memory of her lover returned to her with dizzying enticements: she flung her soul at it, swept away toward that image by a new fervor; and Charles seemed to her as detached from her life, as forever absent, as impossible and annihilated, as if he were about to die and were suffering his death throes before her eyes.","At the sudden impact of those words, crashing into her mind like a leaden bullet into a silver dish, Emma felt herself shudder; and she raised her head, straining to understand what he had meant by them. They looked at each other in silence, almost wonderstruck, each of them, to see that the other was there, so far apart had their thoughts carried them. Charles stared at her with the clouded gaze of a drunken man; motionless in his chair, he was listening to the screams that continued to come from the hotel. One followed after another; each was a long, drawn-out succession of tones, and they were interspersed with short, shrill shrieks; it was all like the howling of some animal being butchered far away. Emma bit her pale lips; and twisting and turning in her fingers a sliver she had broken off the coral, she stared fixedly at Charles with blazing eyes that were like twin fiery arrows. Everything, everything about him exasperated her now—his face, his clothes, what he didn’t say, his entire person, his very existence. She repented her virtue of days past as though it had been a crime; and what virtue she had left now crumbled under the furious assault of her pride. Adultery was triumphant; and she reveled in the prospect of its sordid ironies. The thought of her lover made her reel with desire; heart and soul she flung herself into her longing, borne toward him on waves of new rapture; and Charles seemed to her as detached from her life, as irrevocably gone, as impossible and done for, as though he were a dying man, gasping his last before her eyes."

Il portait un gilet de drap noir, un col de crin, un pantalon gris, et, en toute saison, des bottes bien cirées qui avaient deux renflements parallèles, à cause de la saillie de ses orteils.

Puis, quand ses yeux se reportaient sur la cheminée garnie d’écrans chinois, sur les larges rideaux, sur les fauteuils, sur toutes ces choses enfin qui avaient adouci l’amertume de sa vie, un remords la prenait, ou plutôt un regret immense et qui irritait la passion, loin de l’anéantir. Charles tisonnait avec placidité, les deux pieds sur les chenets.","Charles, during the evening, seemed worried to her. Emma watched him with a look full of anguish, thinking she saw accusations in the wrinkles of his face. Then, when her eyes fell back on the fireplace furnished with Chinese screens, on the wide curtains, on the armchairs, on all those things that had softened the bitterness of her life, a remorse seized her, or rather an immense regret. and which irritated passion, far from annihilating it. Charles poked placidly, both feet on the andirons.","During the evening, Charles seemed to her careworn. Emma studied him with an anguished gaze, believing she could read accusations in the wrinkles on his face. Then, when her eyes rested again on the mantelpiece decorated with Chinese screens, on the wide drapes, the armchairs, all those things that had sweetened the bitterness of her life, she would be overcome with remorse, or, rather, with a vast regret that stimulated her passion rather than killing it. Charles placidly poked the fire, his feet on the andirons.","Charles, she thought during the evening, looked careworn. She scrutinized him with an agonized stare, reading accusations in the drawn lines of his face. Then, as her eyes roved over the mantelpiece, gay with Chinese fans, over the full curtains, the armchairs, all the things that had tempered the bitterness of her life, she was overcome with remorse, or rather with immense regret; and this, far from eclipsing her passion, only exasperated it. Charles placidly stirred the fire, lounging in his chair."
"Les bonnes religieuses, qui avaient si bien présumé de sa vocation, s’aperçurent avec de grands étonnements que mademoiselle Rouault semblait échapper à leur soin. Elles lui avaient, en effet, tant prodigué les offices, les retraites, les neuvaines et les sermons, si bien prêché le respect que l’on doit aux saints et aux martyrs, et donné tant de bons conseils pour la modestie du corps et le salut de son âme, qu’elle fit comme les chevaux que l’on tire par la bride : elle s’arrêta court et le mors lui sortit des dents. Cet esprit, positif au milieu de ses enthousiasmes, qui avait aimé l’église pour ses fleurs, la musique pour les paroles des romances, et la littérature pour ses excitations passionnelles, s’insurgeait devant les mystères de la foi, de même qu’elle s’irritait davantage contre la discipline, qui était quelque chose d’antipathique à sa constitution. Quand son père la retira de pension, on ne fut point fâché de la voir partir. La supérieure trouvait même qu’elle était devenue, dans les derniers temps, peu révérencieuse envers la communauté.","The good nuns, who had presumed so well of her vocation, noticed with great astonishment that Mademoiselle Rouault seemed to escape their care. They had, in fact, lavished on him so many offices, retreats, novenas and sermons, preached the respect due to saints and martyrs so well, and given so much good advice for modesty of body and Salvation of her soul, which she did like horses that are drawn by the bridle: she stopped short and the bit slipped from her teeth. This spirit, positive in the midst of its enthusiasms, which had loved the church for its flowers, music for the words of ballads, and literature for its passionate excitements, rose up before the mysteries of the faith, just as she was more irritated with discipline, which was something antipathetic to her constitution. When her father withdrew her from boarding school, no one was sorry to see her go. The superior even found that she had become, in recent times, not very reverent towards the community.","The good nuns, who had been so confident of her vocation, perceived with great surprise that Mademoiselle Rouault seemed to be slipping out of their control. They had, indeed, lavished upon her so many masses, retreats, novenas, and sermons, so thoroughly preached the respect owed to the saints and martyrs, and given so much good advice concerning the modesty of the body and the salvation of her soul, that she did what horses do when pulled by the reins: she stopped short and the bit slipped from her teeth. That spirit of hers, practical in the midst of its enthusiasms, loving the church for its flowers, music for the words of its songs, and literature for its power to stir the passions, rebelled before the mysteries of faith, just as she grew ever more irritated by its discipline, which was antipathetic to her nature. When her father withdrew her from school, no one was sorry to see her go. The Mother Superior even thought she had become, lately, rather 			irreverent toward the community.","The good nuns, who had been taking her vocation quite for granted, were greatly surprised to find that Mademoiselle Rouault was apparently slipping out of their control. And indeed they had so deluged her with prayers, retreats, novenas and sermons, preached so constantly the respect due the saints and the martyrs, and given her so much good advice about modest behavior and the saving of her soul, that she reacted like a horse too tightly reined: she balked, and the bit fell from her teeth. In her enthusiasms she had always looked for something tangible: she had loved the church for its flowers, music for its romantic words, literature for its power to stir the passions; and she rebelled before the mysteries of faith just as she grew ever more restive under discipline, which was antipathetic to her nature. When her father took her out of school no one was sorry to see her go. The Mother Superior, indeed, remarked that she had lately been displaying a certain lack of reverence toward the community."
"La clef tourna dans la serrure, et elle alla droit vers la troisième tablette, tant son souvenir la guidait bien, saisit le bocal bleu, en arracha le bouchon, y fourra sa main, et, la retirant pleine d’une poudre blanche, elle se mit à manger à même.","The key turned in the lock, and she went straight to the third tablet, her memory guided her so well, seized the blue jar, tore off the cork, thrust her hand into it, and, drawing it out full of white powder, she began to eat himself.","The key turned in the lock, and she went straight to the third shelf, so well did her memory guide her, seized the blue jar, wrenched out the cork, thrust in her hand, and, withdrawing it full of white powder, began to eat it.","The key turned in the lock, and she went straight to the third shelf—so well did her memory serve her as guide—seized the blue jar, tore out the cork, plunged in her hand, withdrew it full of white powder, and ate greedily."

"Au petit jour, madame Bovary mère arriva ; Charles en l’embrassant, eut un nouveau débordement de pleurs.

"Elle se plaignit d’éprouver, depuis le commencement de la saison, des étourdissements ; elle demanda si les bains de mer lui seraient utiles ; elle se mit à causer du couvent, Charles de son collège, les phrases leur vinrent. Ils montèrent dans sa chambre. Elle lui fit voir ses anciens cahiers de musique, les petits livres qu’on lui avait donnés en prix et les couronnes en feuilles de chêne, abandonnées dans un bas d’armoire. Elle lui parla encore de sa mère, du cimetière, et même lui montra dans le jardin la plate-bande dont elle cueillait les fleurs, tous les premiers vendredis de chaque mois, pour les aller mettre sur sa tombe. Mais le jardinier qu’ils avaient n’y entendait rien ; on était si mal servi ! Elle eût bien voulu, ne fût-ce au moins que pendant l’hiver, habiter la ville, quoique la longueur des beaux jours rendît peut-être la campagne plus ennuyeuse encore durant l’été ; – et, selon ce qu’elle disait, sa voix était claire, aiguë, ou se couvrant de langueur tout à coup, traînait des modulations qui finissaient presque en murmures, quand elle se parlait à elle-même, – tantôt joyeuse, ouvrant des yeux naïfs, puis les paupières à demi closes, le regard noyé d’ennui, la pensée vagabondant.","She complained of feeling dizzy since the beginning of the season; she asked if sea bathing would be useful to her; she began to talk about the convent, Charles about his college, the phrases came to them. They went up to his room. She showed him her old music books, the little books she had been given as prizes, and the oak-leaf wreaths abandoned in the bottom of the cupboard. She spoke to him again of her mother, of the cemetery, and even showed him in the garden the flowerbed from which she picked the flowers, every first Friday of each month, to go and put them on her grave. But the gardener they had knew nothing about it; we were so badly served! She would have liked, were it at least only during the winter, to live in the city, although the length of the fine days made the country perhaps even more tiresome during the summer; – and, depending on what she said, her voice was clear, high-pitched, or suddenly covered with languor, trailing modulations which ended almost in murmurs, when she spoke to herself – sometimes joyful, opening up naive eyes, then half-closed eyelids, eyes drowned in boredom, thoughts wandering.","She complained of having suffered, since the beginning of the season, from dizzy spells; she asked if sea bathing would be useful; she began to talk about the convent, Charles about his school, words came to them.

She talked to him, too, about her mother, about the cemetery, and even showed him, in the garden, the bed from which she gathered flowers, on the first Friday of each month, to put on her grave.

Then she spoke of her mother, and the cemetery, and took him out to the garden to see the bed where she picked flowers the first Friday of every month to put on her grave. But their gardener had no understanding of such things: farm help was so trying! She would love, if only for the winter, to live in the city—though she had to say that it was really in summer, with the days so long, that the country was most boring of all. Depending on what she talked about, her voice was clear, or shrill, or would grow suddenly languorous and trail off almost into a murmur, as though she were speaking to herself. One moment she would be gay and wide-eyed; the next, she would half shut her eyelids and seem to be drowned in boredom, her thoughts miles away."

"Les pièces pyrotechniques envoyées à l’adresse du sieur Tuvache avaient, par excès de précaution, été enfermées dans sa cave ; aussi la poudre humide ne s’enflammait guère, et le morceau principal, qui devait figurer un dragon se mordant la queue, rata complètement. De temps à autre, il partait une pauvre chandelle romaine ; alors la foule béante poussait une clameur où se mêlait le cri des femmes à qui l’on chatouillait la taille pendant l’obscurité. Emma, silencieuse, se blottissait doucement contre l’épaule de Charles ; puis, le menton levé, elle suivait dans le ciel noir le jet lumineux des fusées. Rodolphe la contemplait à la lueur des lampions qui brûlaient.","The pyrotechnic pieces sent to the address of Sieur Tuvache had, out of an excess of precaution, been locked up in his cellar; so the wet powder hardly ignited, and the main piece, which must have featured a dragon biting its own tail, failed completely.

Emma, silent, was snuggling gently against Charles’s shoulder; then, lifting her chin, she would follow the rocket’s trail of light through the black sky. Rodolphe was watching her by the glow of the burning oil lamps.","Through overprecaution, the fireworks, which had been delivered in care of Monsieur Tuvache, had been stored in his cellar, with the result that the damp powder could scarcely be got to light; and the culminating number, which was to have depicted a dragon swallowing its own tail, was a complete fiasco. Now and then some pathetic little Roman candle would go off and bring a roar from the gaping crowd—a roar amidst which could be heard the screams of women, fair game for ticklers in the darkness. Emma nestled silently against Charles’s shoulder, raising her head to follow the bright trail of the rockets in the black sky. Rodolphe watched her in the glow of the colored lamps."
"En rentrant, Charles se déshabilla, et le père Rouault repassa sa blouse bleue.

"Elle ne manquait point, il est vrai, de lui prodiguer toute sorte d’attentions, depuis les recherches de table jusqu’aux coquetteries du costume et aux langueurs du regard.

"Il se tenait les bras croisés sur ses genoux, et, ainsi levant la figure vers Emma, il la regardait de près, fixement. Elle distinguait dans ses yeux des petits rayons d’or s’irradiant tout autour de ses pupilles noires, et même elle sentait le parfum de la pommade qui lustrait sa chevelure. Alors une mollesse la saisit, elle se rappela ce vicomte qui l’avait fait valser à la Vaubyessard, et dont la barbe exhalait, comme ces cheveux-là, cette odeur de vanille et de citron ; et, machinalement, elle entreferma les paupières pour la mieux respirer : Mais, dans ce geste qu’elle fit en se cambrant sur sa chaise, elle aperçut au loin, tout au fond de l’horizon, la vieille diligence l’Hirondelle, qui descendait lentement la côte des Leux, en traînant après soi un long panache de poussière. C’était dans cette voiture jaune que Léon, si souvent, était revenu vers elle ; et par cette route là-bas qu’il était parti pour toujours ! Elle crut le voir en face, à sa fenêtre ; puis tout se confondit, des nuages passèrent ; il lui sembla qu’elle tournait encore dans la valse, sous le feu des lustres, au bras du vicomte, et que Léon n’était pas loin, qui allait venir … et cependant elle sentait toujours la tête de Rodolphe à côté d’elle. La douceur de cette sensation pénétrait ainsi ses désirs d’autrefois, et comme des grains de sable sous un coup de vent, ils tourbillonnaient dans la bouffée subtile du parfum qui se répandait sur son âme. Elle ouvrit les narines à plusieurs reprises, fortement, pour aspirer la fraîcheur des lierres autour des chapiteaux. Elle retira ses gants, elle s’essuya les mains ; puis, avec son mouchoir, elle s’éventait la figure, tandis qu’à travers le battement de ses tempes elle entendait la rumeur de la foule et la voix du Conseiller qui psalmodiait ses phrases.","He stood with his arms crossed on his knees, and thus raising his face to Emma, he gazed at her closely and fixedly. She could make out small rays of gold in his eyes radiating all around his black pupils, and she even smelled the perfume of the pomade that polished her hair. Then a softness seized her, she remembered that viscount who had made her waltz at the Vaubyessard, and whose beard exhaled, like that hair, that odor of vanilla and lemon; and, mechanically, she closed her eyelids to breathe it better. slowly descended the coast of Les Leux, dragging a long plume of dust behind it. It was in this yellow carriage that Leon had so often returned to her; and by that road yonder he was gone forever! She thought she saw him opposite, at her window; then everything became confused, clouds passed; it seemed to her that she was still spinning in the waltz, under the fire of the chandeliers, on the arm of the Viscount, and that Léon was not far away, who was coming... and yet she still felt Rodolphe's head next to her . The sweetness of this sensation thus penetrated her longings of old, and like grains of sand under a gust of wind, they swirled in the subtle puff of the perfume which spread over her soul. She opened her nostrils several times, strongly, to breathe in the freshness of the ivy around the capitals. She took off her gloves, she wiped her hands; then, with her handkerchief, she fanned her face, while through the beating of her temples she heard the murmur of the crowd and the voice of the Counselor who chanted his phrases.","He sat with his arms crossed over his knees, and, lifting his face toward Emma, he looked at her fixedly from very near.

Then a languor came over her; she recalled the vicomte who had waltzed with her at La Vaubyessard, whose beard had given off the same smell of vanilla and lemon as this hair; and reflexively she half closed her eyelids the better to breathe it in. But as she did this, straightening in her chair, she saw in the distance, on the farthest horizon, the old stagecoach, the Hirondelle, slowly descending the hill of Les Leux, trailing a long plume of dust behind it. It was in that yellow carriage that Léon had so often returned to her; and by that very road he had left forever!

And so the sweetness of this sensation permeated her desires of earlier times, and like grains of sand before a gust of wind, they whirled about in the subtle whiff of the fragrance that was spreading through her soul. Again and again she opened wide her nostrils to breathe in the freshness of the ivy around the capitals. She drew off her gloves, she dried her hands; then, with her handkerchief, she fanned her face, while through the pulsing at her temples she could hear the murmur of the crowd and the voice of the Councilor intoning his phrases.","He was leaning forward with his arms crossed on his knees, and lifting his face to Emma ’s he looked at her fixedly from very near.

Aussi jugea-t-elle utile de descendre chaque fois à la Croix rouge, de sorte que les bonnes gens de son village qui la voyaient dans l’escalier ne se doutaient de rien.","No matter if he had not asked for explanations, others later could be less discreet. So she thought it useful to go down each time to the Red Cross, so that the good people of her village who saw her on the stairs suspected nothing.","It did not matter that he had not asked for explanations, others might later prove less discreet. And so she felt it useful to get out at the Croix Rouge, each time, so that the good people of her village who saw her on the stairs would not suspect anything.","Still, though he hadn’t asked for explanations, others, in the future, might be less discreet. So she thought it practical to take a room each time at the Croix-Rouge, in order that her fellow villagers might see her there and have no suspicion."
"– Sot ! disait-il ; petit sot, vraiment ! sot en trois lettres ! Grand-chose, après tout, qu’une phlébotomie ! et un gaillard qui n’a peur de rien ! une espèce d’écureuil, tel que vous le voyez, qui monte locher des noix à des hauteurs vertigineuses. Ah ! oui, parle, vante-toi ! voilà de belles dispositions à exercer plus tard la pharmacie ; car tu peux te trouver appelé en des circonstances graves, par-devant les tribunaux, afin d’y éclairer la conscience des magistrats ; et il faudra pourtant garder son sang-froid, raisonner, se montrer homme, ou bien passer pour un imbécile !","– Stupid! he said ; fool, really! stupid in three letters! Much more, after all, than a phlebotomy! and a fellow who is not afraid of anything! a kind of squirrel, such as you see, that climbs to loaf nuts to dizzying heights. Ah! yes, speak, brag! here are fine dispositions to practice pharmacy later on; for you may find yourself called in serious circumstances, before the tribunals, in order to enlighten the conscience of the magistrates there; and yet you will have to keep your cool, reason, show yourself to be a man, or else pass for an imbecile!","“Fool!” he said. “You little fool! Really! Fool, spelled f-o-o-l! Quite an event, isn’t it—a phlebotomy! A strapping fellow like you, who isn’t afraid of anything! Just look at him—like a squirrel, he climbs up to shake the nuts down from dizzying heights. Ah, yes! Speak up, boast about yourself! What a fine natural aptitude you’ll have for being a pharmacist later on; you know, you may be called before a tribunal in some serious situation, to enlighten the magistrates; and you’ll have to maintain your composure, speak rationally, show yourself to be a man, or else be taken for an imbecile!”","“Idiot!” he said. “Idiot with a capital I! A terrible thing, a little blood-letting, isn’t it! A fine fearless fellow, too. Just look at him! And yet I’ve seen him go up a tree after nuts like a squirrel—up to the dizziest heights, Messieurs et Madame! Say something, can’t you? Tell us how good you are! You’ll certainly make a fine pharmacist! Don’t you know that some day you may be called on to give important evidence in court? The judges may need your expert opinion. You’ll have to keep calm at such times, and know what to say! You’ll have to show them you’re a man, or else be called a fool!”"

"Les bêtes étaient là, le nez tourné vers la ficelle, et alignant confusément leurs croupes inégales. Des porcs assoupis enfonçaient en terre leur groin ; des veaux beuglaient ; des brebis bêlaient ; les vaches, un jarret replié, étalaient leur ventre sur le gazon, et, ruminant lentement, clignaient leurs paupières lourdes, sous les moucherons qui bourdonnaient autour d’elles. Des charretiers, les bras nus, retenaient par le licou des étalons cabrés, qui hennissaient à pleins naseaux du côté des juments. Elles restaient paisibles, allongeant la tête et la crinière pendante, tandis que leurs poulains se reposaient à leur ombre, ou venaient les téter quelquefois ; et, sur la longue ondulation de tous ces corps tassés, on voyait se lever au vent, comme un flot, quelque crinière blanche, ou bien saillir des cornes aiguës, et des têtes d’hommes qui couraient. À l’écart, en dehors des lices, cent pas plus loin, il y avait un grand taureau noir muselé, portant un cercle de fer à la narine, et qui ne bougeait pas plus qu’une bête de bronze. Un enfant en haillons le tenait par une corde.","The beasts were there, their noses turned towards the string, and confusedly aligning their uneven rumps. Drowsy pigs buried their snouts in the ground; calves bellowing; sheep were bleating; the cows, one hock bent, spread their bellies on the grass, and, ruminating slowly, blinked their heavy eyelids, under the gnats which buzzed around them. Carters, bare-armed, were restraining prancing stallions by the halters, who neighed with full nostrils towards the mares. They remained peaceful, stretching out their heads and hanging manes, while their foals rested in their shade, or sometimes came to suckle them; and, on the long undulation of all these huddled bodies, one saw rising in the wind, like a wave, some white mane, or else sticking out sharp horns, and the heads of running men. Away, outside the lists, a hundred paces beyond, there was a large black muzzled bull, wearing an iron hoop at its nostril, and which moved no more than a bronze beast. A ragged child held him by a rope.","The animals were there, their noses turned to the rope, their unequal hindquarters forming a ragged line. Drowsy pigs were burrowing in the earth with their snouts; calves were bawling; sheep were bleating; cows, one leg folded in, spread their bellies over the grass and, slowly chewing their cuds, blinked their heavy eyelids under the flies that buzzed around them. Bare-armed carters held the halters of rearing stallions that whinnied with widened nostrils in the direction of the mares, who remained calm, reaching out their heads and hanging manes while their foals rested in their shadow or came now and then to suckle from them; and over the long undulation of all these massed bodies, one could see a white mane rising in the wind, like a wave, or sharp horns thrusting up, and the heads of men running. Off to one side, beyond the enclosure, a hundred paces away, was a big black bull wearing a muzzle and an iron ring in its nose, as 			motionless as a bronze statue. A child in rags held it by a rope.","Here stood the livestock, noses to the rope, rumps of all shapes and sizes forming a ragged line. Lethargic pigs were nuzzling the earth with their snouts; calves were lowing and sheep bleating; cows with their legs folded under them lay on the grass, slowly chewing their cud and blinking their heavy eyelids under the midges buzzing around them. Bare-armed teamsters were holding rearing stallions by the halter: these were neighing loudly in the direction of the mares, who stood there quietly, necks outstretched and manes drooping, as their foals rested in their shadow or came now and again to suck. Above the long undulating line of these massed bodies a white mane would occasionally surge up like a wave in the wind, or a pair of sharp horns would stick out, or men’s heads would bob up as they ran. Quite apart, outside the arena, a hundred yards off, was a big black bull with a strap harness and an iron ring through its nose, motionless as a brazen image. A ragged little boy held it by a rope."
"M. Lieuvain se rassit alors ; M. Derozerays se leva, commençant un autre discours. Le sien peut-être, ne fut point aussi fleuri que celui du Conseiller ; mais il se recommandait par un caractère de style plus positif, c’est-à-dire par des connaissances plus spéciales et des considérations plus relevées. Ainsi, l’éloge du gouvernement y tenait moins de place ; la religion et l’agriculture en occupaient davantage. On y voyait le rapport de l’une et de l’autre, et comment elles avaient concouru toujours à la civilisation. Rodolphe, avec madame Bovary, causait rêves, pressentiments, magnétisme. Remontant au berceau des sociétés, l’orateur vous dépeignait ces temps farouches où les hommes vivaient de glands, au fond des bois. Puis ils avaient quitté la dépouille des bêtes ; endossé le drap, creusé des sillons, planté la vigne. Était-ce un bien, et n’y avait-il pas dans cette découverte plus d’inconvénients que d’avantages ? M. Derozerays se posait ce problème. Du magnétisme, peu à peu, Rodolphe en était venu aux affinités, et, tandis que M. le président citait Cincinnatus à sa charrue, Dioclétien plantant ses choux, et les empereurs de la Chine inaugurant l’année par des semailles, le jeune homme expliquait à la jeune femme que ces attractions irrésistibles tiraient leur cause de quelque existence antérieure.","M. Lieuvain then sat down again; Mr. Derozerays rose, beginning another speech. His, perhaps, was not so flowery as that of the Councillor; but he recommended himself by a more positive character of style, that is to say by more special knowledge and more elevated considerations. Thus, the praise of the government held less place in it; religion and agriculture occupied more. We saw there the relationship of one to the other, and how they had always contributed to civilization. Rodolphe, with Madame Bovary, talked dreams, presentiments, magnetism. Going back to the cradle of societies, the speaker depicted those wild times when men lived on acorns, deep in the woods. Then they had left the remains of the beasts; put on the sheet, dug the furrows, planted the vines. Was it a good thing, and were there not in this discovery more disadvantages than advantages? Mr. Derozerays posed this problem. From magnetism, little by little, Rodolphe had come to affinities, and, while the president quoted Cincinnatus to his plow, Diocletian planting his cabbage, and the emperors of China inaugurating the year with sowing, the young man explained to the young woman that these irresistible attractions drew their cause from some previous existence.","Then Monsieur Lieuvain sat down; Monsieur Derozerays stood up and began another speech. His was perhaps not as flowery as the Councilor’s; but it merited respect for its more positive style, that is, for its more specialized knowledge and loftier considerations. Thus, less space was taken up by praise of the government; religion and agriculture occupied more. Clearly shown was the relationship between the two, and how they had always contributed to civilization. Rodolphe was talking with Madame Bovary about dreams, presentiments, magnetism. Going back to the cradle of human society, the orator was depicting those primitive times in which men lived on acorns deep in the forest. Then they had left off their animal skins, donned cloth, dug furrows, planted vines. Was this a good thing? Weren’t there more drawbacks than advantages in this discovery? This was the problem Monsieur Derozerays had set himself. From magnetism, Rodolphe had gradually moved 			on to affinities, and while the chairman cited Cincinnatus at his plow, Diocletian planting his cabbages, and the emperors of China inaugurating the new year by sowing seed, the young man was explaining to the young woman that these irresistible attractions had their source in some previous existence.","Monsieur Lieuvain sat down. Monsieur Derozerays stood up, and began another speech. His was perhaps not quite so flowery as the councilor’s; but it had the advantage of being characterized by a more positive style—by a more specialized knowledge, that is, and more pertinent arguments. There was less praise of the government, and more mention of religion and agriculture. He showed the relation between the two and how they had always worked together for the good of civilization. Rodolphe was talking to Madame Bovary about dreams, forebodings, magnetism. Going back to the cradle of human society, the orator depicted the savage ages when men lived off acorns in the depths of the forest. Then they had cast off their animal skins, garbed themselves in cloth, dug the ground and planted the vine. Was this an advance? Didn’t this discovery entail more disadvantages than benefits? That was the problem Monsieur Derozerays set himself. From magnetism Rodolphe gradually moved on to affinities; and as the chairman cited Cincinnatus and his plow, Diogenes planting his cabbages and the Chinese emperors celebrating the New Year by sowing seed, the young man was explaining to the young woman that these irresistible attractions had their roots in some earlier existence."

"– Du reste, disait l’apothicaire, l’exercice de la médecine n’est pas fort pénible en nos contrées ; car l’état de nos routes permet l’usage du cabriolet, et, généralement, l’on paye assez bien, les cultivateurs étant aisés. Nous avons, sous le rapport médical, à part les cas ordinaires d’entérite, bronchite, affections bilieuses, etc., de temps à autre quelques fièvres intermittentes à la moisson, mais, en somme, peu de choses graves, rien de spécial à noter, si ce n’est beaucoup d’humeurs froides, et qui tiennent sans doute aux déplorables conditions hygiéniques de nos logements de paysan. Ah ! vous trouverez bien des préjugés à combattre, monsieur Bovary ; bien des entêtements de la routine, où se heurteront quotidiennement tous les efforts de votre science ; car on a recours encore aux neuvaines, aux reliques, au curé, plutôt que de venir naturellement chez le médecin ou chez le pharmacien. Le climat, pourtant, n’est point, à vrai dire, mauvais, et même nous comptons dans la commune quelques nonagénaires. Le thermomètre (j’en ai fait les observations) descend en hiver jusqu’à quatre degrés, et, dans la forte saison, touche vingt-cinq, trente centigrades tout au plus, ce qui nous donne vingt-quatre Réaumur au maximum, ou autrement cinquante-quatre Fahrenheit (mesure anglaise), pas davantage ! – et, en effet, nous sommes abrités des vents du nord par la forêt d’Argueil d’une part, des vents d’ouest par la côte Saint-Jean de l’autre, et cette chaleur, cependant, qui à cause de la vapeur d’eau dégagée par la rivière et la présence considérable de bestiaux dans les prairies, lesquels exhalent, comme vous savez, beaucoup d’ammoniaque, c’est-à-dire azote, hydrogène et oxygène (non, azote et hydrogène seulement), et qui, pompant à elle l’humus de la terre, confondant toutes ces émanations différentes, les réunissant en un faisceau, pour ainsi dire, et se combinant de soi-même avec l’électricité répandue dans l’atmosphère, lorsqu’il y en a, pourrait à la longue, comme dans les pays tropicaux, engendrer des miasmes insalubres ; – cette chaleur, dis-je, se trouve justement tempérée du côté où elle vient, ou plutôt d’où elle viendrait, c’est-à-dire du côté sud, par les vents de sud-est, lesquels, s’étant rafraîchis d’eux-mêmes en passant sur la Seine, nous arrivent quelquefois tout d’un coup, comme des brises de Russie !","“Besides,” said the apothecary, “the practice of medicine is not very difficult in our country; because the state of our roads allows the use of the convertible, and, generally, one pays rather well, the farmers being well off. We have, from a medical point of view, apart from the ordinary cases of enteritis, bronchitis, bilious affections, etc., from time to time a few intermittent fevers at harvest, but, on the whole, few serious things, nothing special to to note, if not many cold moods, and which are doubtless due to the deplorable hygienic conditions of our peasant dwellings. Ah! you will find many prejudices to combat, Monsieur Bovary; many of the stubbornnesses of routine, with which all the efforts of your science will daily come up against; because we still have recourse to novenas, to relics, to the priest, rather than coming naturally to the doctor or the pharmacist. The climate, however, is not, to tell the truth, bad, and we even count in the commune a few nonagenarians. The thermometer (I have made observations of it) descends in winter to four degrees, and, in the high season, touches twenty-five, thirty centigrades at the most, which gives us twenty-four Réaumur at the most, or otherwise fifty-four Fahrenheit (English measure), no more! – and, indeed, we are sheltered from the north winds by the forest of Argueil on the one hand, from the westerly winds by the Saint-Jean coast on the other, and this heat, however, which because of the water vapor released by the river and the considerable presence of cattle in the prairies, which exhale, as you know, a lot of ammonia, that is to say nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen (no, nitrogen and hydrogen only ), and which, pumping to it the humus of the earth, confounding all these different emanations, uniting them in a bundle, so to speak, and combining of itself with the electricity diffused in the atmosphere, when there are, could in the long run, as in tropical countries, generate unhealthy miasma; – this heat, I say, is precisely tempered on the side where it comes, or rather where it would come from, that is to say on the south side, by the south-easterly winds, which, having Refreshed by themselves as they pass over the Seine, they sometimes come to us suddenly, like breezes from Russia!","“As a matter of fact,” said the apothecary, “the practice of medicine is not very arduous in our area; for the condition of our roads permits the use of a carriage, and generally one is quite well paid, the farmers being prosperous. Medically speaking, apart from ordinary cases of enteritis, bronchitis, bilious attacks, and so forth, now and then we have some intermittent fevers at harvest time, but on the whole, very little that’s serious, nothing especially noteworthy, except a good deal of scrofula, due, no doubt, to the deplorable hygienic conditions of our peasants’ homes. Ah, yes, you’ll find yourself struggling against a good many prejudices, Monsieur Bovary, a good deal of pigheaded adherence to tradition, which all your scientific efforts will run up against every day; for people still resort to novenas, relics, the curé, instead of doing the natural thing and going to the doctor or the pharmacist. Still, the 			climate is not, in truth, bad, and we can even number a few nonagenarians in the community. The thermometer (I have made the observations myself) descends in the winter as low as four degrees and in the warm season reaches twenty-five, thirty centigrade at the very most, which gives us twenty-four Réaumur maximum or, to put it another way, fifty-four Fahrenheit (English measure), and no more!—and, in fact, we’re sheltered from the north winds by the Argueil forest on the one hand, from the west winds by the Saint-Jean hill on the other; and yet this warmth, which, because of the water vapor given off by the stream and the considerable presence of cattle in the meadows, exhaling, as you know, a good deal of ammonia, that is to say nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (no, just nitrogen and hydrogen), and which, sucking the moisture from the earth’s humus, mingling all these different emanations, bringing them together in a bundle, so to 			speak, and itself combining with the electricity diffused in the atmosphere, when there is any, could eventually, as in the tropical countries, engender unhealthy miasmas;—this warmth, I say, is tempered precisely in the quarter from which it comes, or rather from which it would come, that is, in the south, by the southeast winds, which, having cooled as they passed over the Seine, sometimes swoop down upon us, like breezes from Russia!”","“If you have the opportunity, of course.” “As a matter of fact,” said the apothecary, “the practice of medicine isn’t particularly arduous in this part of the world. The condition of our roads makes it possible to use a gig, and, generally speaking, payment is good—the farmers are well off. Aside from the usual cases of enteritis, bronchitis, liver complaint, etc., our roster of illnesses includes an occasional intermittent fever at harvest time, but on the whole very little that’s serious except for a good deal of scrofula, probably the result of the deplorable hygienic conditions in our countryside. Ah! You’ll have to fight many a prejudice, Monsieur Bovary; every day your scientific efforts will be thwarted by the peasant’s stubborn adherence to his old ways. Plenty of our people still have recourse to novenas and relics and the priest, instead of doing the natural thing and coming to the doctor or the pharmacist. To tell the truth, however, the climate isn’t at all bad: we even have a few nonagenarians. The thermometer—this I can tell you from personal observation—goes down in winter to four degrees, and in the hottest season touches twenty-five or thirty degrees Centigrade at the most—that is, twenty-four degrees Réaumur at a maximum, or, in other words, fifty-four degrees Fahrenheit, to use the English scale—not more! You see, we’re sheltered from the north winds by the Argueil forest on the one side and from the west winds by the bluffs of Saint-Jean on the other. However, this warmth, which because of the dampness given off by the river and the number of cattle in the pastures, which themselves exhale, as you know, a great deal of ammonia, that is nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (no, just nitrogen and hydrogen), and which, sucking up the humus from the soil, mixing all these different emanations together—making a package of them, so to speak—and combining also with the electricity in the atmosphere when there is any, could in the long run result in noxious miasmas, as in tropical countries; this warmth, I was saying, is actually moderated from the direction from which it comes, or rather the direction from which it could come, namely, from the south, by southeast winds, which being of course cool themselves as a result of crossing the Seine sometimes burst on us all of a sudden like arctic air from Russia!”"

"De temps à autre, on entendait des coups de fouet derrière la haie ; bientôt la barrière s’ouvrait : c’était une carriole qui entrait. Galopant jusqu’à la première marche du perron, elle s’y arrêtait court, et vidait son monde, qui sortait par tous les côtés en se frottant les genoux et en s’étirant les bras. Les dames, en bonnet, avaient des robes à la façon de la ville, des chaînes de montre en or, des pèlerines à bouts croisés dans la ceinture, ou de petits fichus de couleur attachés dans le dos avec une épingle, et qui leur découvraient le cou par derrière. Les gamins, vêtus pareillement à leurs papas, semblaient incommodés par leurs habits neufs (beaucoup même étrennèrent ce jour-là la première paire de bottes de leur existence), et l’on voyait à côté d’eux, ne soufflant mot dans la robe blanche de sa première communion rallongée pour la circonstance, quelque grande fillette de quatorze ou seize ans, leur cousine ou leur sœur aînée sans doute, rougeaude, ahurie, les cheveux gras de pommade à la rose, et ayant bien peur de salir ses gants. Comme il n’y avait point assez de valets d’écurie pour dételer toutes les voitures, les messieurs retroussaient leurs manches et s’y mettaient eux-mêmes. Suivant leur position sociale différente, ils avaient des habits, des redingotes, des vestes, des habits-vestes : – bons habits, entourés de toute la considération d’une famille, et qui ne sortaient de l’armoire que pour les solennités ; redingotes à grandes basques flottant au vent, à collet cylindrique, à poches larges comme des sacs ; vestes de gros drap, qui accompagnaient ordinairement quelque casquette cerclée de cuivre à sa visière ; habits-vestes très courts, ayant dans le dos deux boutons rapprochés comme une paire d’yeux, et dont les pans semblaient avoir été coupés à même un seul bloc, par la hache du charpentier. Quelques-uns encore (mais ceux-là, bien sûr, devaient dîner au bas bout de la table) portaient des blouses de cérémonie, c’est-à-dire dont le col était rabattu sur les épaules, le dos froncé à petits plis et la taille attachée très bas par une ceinture cousue.","From time to time, whippings could be heard behind the hedge; soon the barrier opened: a cart was entering.

The kids, dressed similarly to their fathers, seemed bothered by their new clothes (many even tried on that day the first pair of boots of their existence), and one could see next to them, not breathing a word in the dress white from her First Communion lengthened for the occasion, some tall little girl of fourteen or sixteen, their cousin or elder sister no doubt, ruddy, bewildered, her hair greasy with rose pomade, and very much afraid of soiling her gloves. As there were not enough stablemen to unhitch all the carriages, the gentlemen rolled up their sleeves and set about it themselves. According to their different social position, they had clothes, frock coats, jackets, coat-jackets: – good clothes, surrounded by all the consideration of a family, and which only came out of the wardrobe for solemnities; frock coats with large tails fluttering in the wind, cylindrical collars, pockets the size of sacks; jackets of coarse cloth, which usually accompanied some copper-rimmed cap at its visor; Very short jackets, with two buttons in the back close together like a pair of eyes, and the tails of which seemed to have been cut from a single block by the carpenter's axe. A few more (but these, of course, had to dine at the lower end of the table) wore ceremonial blouses, that is to say whose collars were turned down over the shoulders, the backs gathered in small pleats. and the waist fastened very low by a sewn belt.","From time to time, a whip would be heard cracking behind the hedge; soon the gate would open: it was a cariole entering.

The ladies wore country-style headdresses and city-style gowns, with gold watch chains, tippets (the ends crossed and tucked into their belts), or small colored fichus attached at the back with pins and leaving the neck bare. The boys, attired exactly like their papas, looked ill at ease in their new clothes (and indeed many of them were wearing leather shoes that day for the first time in their lives); and next to them would be some speechless, gangling girl of fourteen or sixteen, probably their cousin or their older sister, flushed and awkward in her white First Communion dress let down for the occasion, her hair sticky with scented pomade, terribly worried lest she dirty her gloves. Since there weren’t enough stable hands to unharness all the carriages, the men rolled up their sleeves and went to it themselves. According to their social status, they wore tail coats, frock coats, long jackets or short jackets. The tail coats were worthy garments, each of them a prized family possession taken out of the closet only on great occasions; the frock coats had great flaring skirts that billowed in the wind, cylindrical collars, and pockets as capacious as bags; the long jackets were double-breasted, of coarse wool, and usually worn with a cap of some kind, its peak trimmed with brass; and the short jackets were very short indeed, with two back buttons set close together like a pair of eyes, and stiff tails that looked as though a carpenter had hacked them with his axe out of a single block of wood. A few guests (these, of course, would sit at the foot of the table) wore dress smocks—that is, smocks with turned-down collars, fine pleating at the back, and stitched belts low on the hips."

"– C’est pour éviter ce gros homme : vous savez, l’apothicaire.","“It’s to avoid that big man: you know, the apothecary.","“I was trying to avoid that coarse fellow—you know, the pharmacist.”","“I was trying to avoid that bore,” he said savagely. “You know, the apothecary.”"
"– Vous avez raison, interrompit l’apothicaire, c’est le revers de la médaille ! et l’on y est obligé continuellement d’avoir la main posée sur son gousset. Ainsi, vous êtes dans un jardin public, je suppose ; un quidam se présente, bien mis, décoré même, et qu’on prendrait pour un diplomate ; il vous aborde ; vous causez ; il s’insinue, vous offre une prise ou vous ramasse votre chapeau. Puis on se lie davantage ; il vous mène au café, vous invite à venir dans sa maison de campagne, vous fait faire, entre deux vins, toutes sortes de connaissances, et, les trois quarts du temps ce n’est que pour flibuster votre bourse ou vous entraîner en des démarches pernicieuses.","“You are right,” interrupted the apothecary, “that is the other side of the coin! and one is continually obliged to have one's hand resting on one's pocket. So you're in a park, I suppose; a fellow presents himself, well dressed, even decorated, and whom one would take for a diplomat; he approaches you; you are talking; he insinuates himself, offers you a catch or picks up your hat. Then we bond more; he takes you to the cafe, invites you to come to his country house, makes you, between two wines, make all sorts of acquaintances, and three-quarters of the time it is only to filibuster your purse or train you in pernicious steps.","“You’re right,” interrupted the apothecary; “that’s the other side of the coin! And you must always keep your hand on your pocket there. For instance, supposing you’re in a public park; some fellow comes up to you, well turned out, even decorated, someone you would take for a diplomat; he speaks to you; you get into a conversation with him; he ingratiates himself, offers you a pinch of snuff or picks up your hat for you. Then the two of you become friendlier; he takes you to a café, invites you to his house in the country, introduces you, between one glass and the next, to all sorts of people, and three-quarters of the time, it’s only to make off with your purse or entice you into some pernicious adventure.”","“You’re right,” interrupted the apothecary. “It’s the reverse of the medal. In the city you’ve got to keep your hand in your watch-pocket every minute. Suppose you’re sitting in a park. Some fellow comes up to you—well dressed, perhaps even wearing a decoration—somebody you could take for a diplomat. He addresses you, you talk, he ingratiates himself—offers you a pinch of snuff or picks up your hat for you. Then you get friendlier; he takes you to a café, invites you to visit him in the country, introduces you to all kinds of people over your drinks—and three-quarters of the time it’s only to get his hands on your purse or lead you into evil ways.”"
"Il était là, geignant sous ses grosses couvertures, pâle, la barbe longue, les yeux caves, et, de temps à autre, tournant sa tête en sueur sur le sale oreiller où s’abattaient les mouches.

"En effet, la petite fille se roulait alors sur le gazon, au milieu de l’herbe qu’on fanait. Elle était couchée à plat ventre, au haut d’une meule. Sa bonne la retenait par la jupe.

"Elle se demandait s’il n’y aurait pas eu moyen, par d’autres combinaisons du hasard, de rencontrer un autre homme ; et elle cherchait à imaginer quels eussent été ces événements non survenus, cette vie différente, ce mari qu’elle ne connaissait pas.

What were they doing now? In the city, with the noise of the streets, the hum of the theaters and the lights of the ball, they had existences where the heart expands, where the senses blossom. But her life was cold as an attic whose skylight is to the north, and boredom, a silent spider, spun its web in the shadows in all the corners of her heart. She remembered the days when prizes were given out, when she would come up to the stage to get her little wreaths. With her braided hair, her white dress, and her open shoes, she had a nice manner, and the gentlemen, when she returned to her place, leaned over to pay her compliments; the yard was full of carriages, they were bidding him farewell through the doors, the music master was passing in salute, with his violin box.

"Tous les jours, à la même heure, le maître d’école, en bonnet de soie noire, ouvrait les auvents de sa maison, et le garde-champêtre passait, portant son sabre sur sa blouse. Soir et matin, les chevaux de la poste, trois par trois, traversaient la rue pour aller boire à la mare. De temps à autre, la porte d’un cabaret faisait tinter sa sonnette, et, quand il y avait du vent ; l’on entendait grincer sur leurs deux tringles les petites cuvettes en cuivre du perruquier, qui servaient d’enseigne à sa boutique. Elle avait pour décoration une vieille gravure de modes collée contre un carreau et un buste de femme en cire, dont les cheveux étaient jaunes. Lui aussi, le perruquier, il se lamentait de sa vocation arrêtée, de son avenir perdu, et, rêvant quelque boutique dans une grande ville, comme à Rouen par exemple, sur le port, près du théâtre, il restait toute la journée à se promener en long, depuis la mairie jusqu’à l’église, sombre, et attendant la clientèle. Lorsque madame Bovary levait les yeux, elle le voyait toujours là, comme une sentinelle en faction, avec son bonnet grec sur l’oreille et sa veste de lasting.","Every day, at the same hour, the schoolmaster, in a black silk cap, opened the awnings of his house, and the rural policeman passed by, carrying his saber over his blouse. Evening and morning, the post-horses, three by three, crossed the street to go and drink at the pond. From time to time the door of a cabaret rang its bell, and when it was windy; you could hear the wigmaker's little brass basins creaking on their two rods, which served as a sign in his shop. It had for decoration an old fashion plate pasted against a pane and a wax bust of a woman, whose hair was yellow. He too, the wigmaker, he lamented his career stopped, his lost future, and, dreaming of some shop in a big city, as in Rouen for example, on the port, near the theater, he remained all day long walk along, from the town hall to the church, dark, and waiting for customers. When Madame Bovary raised her eyes, she always saw him there, like a sentinel on duty, with his Greek cap over his ears and his lasting jacket.","Every day, at the same hour, the schoolmaster, in a black silk cap, would open the shutters of his house, and the village policeman would pass, wearing his sword over his smock.

The hairdresser, too, lamented the vocation that had never come to pass, his ruined future, and, dreaming of a shop in a large city, such as Rouen, for example, on the harbor, near the theater, he would spend all day walking back and forth from the village hall to the church, gloomily waiting for customers.

His window display consisted of an old fashion plate stuck on one of the panes, and a wax bust of a woman with yellow hair. The barber, too, was accustomed to bewail the waste of his talents, his ruined career; and dreaming of a shop in a large city—in Rouen, perhaps, on the river front, or near the theatre—he paced back and forth all day between the mayor’s office and the church, gloomily waiting for customers. When Madame Bovary raised her eyes she always saw him there with his cap over one ear, and his short work jacket, like a sentry on duty."

"Elle songeait quelquefois que c’étaient là pourtant les plus beaux jours de sa vie, la lune de miel, comme on disait. Pour en goûter la douceur, il eût fallu, sans doute, s’en aller vers ces pays à noms sonores où les lendemains de mariage ont de plus suaves paresses ! Dans des chaises de poste, sous des stores de soie bleue, on monte au pas des routes escarpées, écoutant la chanson du postillon, qui se répète dans la montagne avec les clochettes des chèvres et le bruit sourd de la cascade. Quand le soleil se couche, on respire au bord des golfes le parfum des citronniers ; puis, le soir, sur la terrasse des villas, seuls et les doigts confondus, on regarde les étoiles en faisant des projets. Il lui semblait que certains lieux sur la terre devaient produire du bonheur, comme une plante particulière au sol et qui pousse mal tout autre part. Que ne pouvait-elle s’accouder sur le balcon des chalets suisses ou enfermer sa tristesse dans un cottage écossais, avec un mari vêtu d’un habit de velours noir à longues basques, et qui porte des bottes molles, un chapeau pointu et des manchettes !","She sometimes thought that those were the happiest days of her life, the honeymoon, as they said. To taste its sweetness, it would have been necessary, no doubt, to go to those countries with sonorous names where the aftermath of marriage has the sweetest laziness! In post-chaises, under blinds of blue silk, we climb the steep roads at a step, listening to the song of the postilion, which is repeated in the mountains with the bells of the goats and the muffled sound of the waterfall. When the sun goes down, we breathe the perfume of the lemon trees on the edge of the gulfs; then, in the evening, on the terrace of the villas, alone and with confused fingers, we look at the stars while making plans. It seemed to him that certain places on earth must produce happiness, like a particular plant on the ground that does not grow well anywhere else. Why couldn't she lean on the balcony of the Swiss chalets or shut up her sadness in a Scottish cottage, with a husband dressed in a black velvet coat with long skirts, and who wears soft boots, a pointed hat and headlines!","She sometimes imagined that these were, nevertheless, the most beautiful days of her life—the honeymoon, as it was called. To savor its sweetness, she would doubtless have had to go off to one of those lands with melodious names where the days following a wedding have a softer indolence! In a post chaise, under curtains of blue silk, you climb the steep roads at a walk, listening to the postilion’s song as it echoes through the mountains, mingling with the bells of the goats and the muffled sound of a waterfall. As the sun goes down, you stand together on the shore of some bay, inhaling the fragrance of the lemon trees; then, at night, alone on the terrace of a villa, your fingers intertwined, you gaze at the stars and make plans. It seemed to her that certain places on earth must produce happiness, like a plant that was peculiar to that soil and grew poorly in any other spot. If only she could have leaned her elbows on 			the balcony of a Swiss chalet or locked away her sadness in a cottage in Scotland, with a husband dressed in a long-skirted black velvet coat, soft boots, a pointed hat, and ruffles at his wrist!","She reflected occasionally that these were, nevertheless, the most beautiful days of her life—the honeymoon days, as people called them. To be sure, their sweetness would be best enjoyed far off, in one of those lands with exciting names where the first weeks of marriage can be savored so much more deliciously and languidly! The post-chaise with its blue silk curtains would have climbed slowly up the mountain roads, and the postilion’s song would have reechoed among the cliffs, mingling with the tinkling of goat bells and the dull roar of waterfalls. They would have breathed the fragrance of lemon trees at sunset by the shore of some bay; and at night, alone on the terrace of a villa, their fingers intertwined, they would have gazed at the stars and planned their lives. It seemed to her that certain portions of the earth must produce happiness—as though it were a plant native only to those soils and doomed to languish elsewhere. Why couldn’t she be leaning over the balcony of some Swiss chalet? Or nursing her melancholy in a cottage in Scotland, with a husband clad in a long black velvet coat and wearing soft leather shoes, a high-crowned hat and fancy cuffs?"

"Quand Charles rentrait, il trouvait auprès des cendres ses pantoufles à chauffer.

"Il arriva qu’au commencement du printemps, un notaire d’Ingouville, détenteur de fonds de la veuve Dubuc, s’embarqua, par une belle marée, emportant avec lui tout l’argent de son étude. Héloïse, il est vrai, possédait encore, outre une part de bateau évaluée six mille francs, sa maison de la rue Saint-François ; et cependant, de toute cette fortune que l’on avait fait sonner si haut, rien, si ce n’est un peu de mobilier et quelques nippes, n’avait paru dans le ménage. Il fallut tirer la chose au clair. La maison de Dieppe se trouva vermoulue d’hypothèques jusque dans ses pilotis ; ce qu’elle avait mis chez le notaire, Dieu seul le savait, et la part de barque n’excéda point mille écus. Elle avait donc menti, la bonne dame ! Dans son exaspération, M. Bovary père, brisant une chaise contre les pavés, accusa sa femme d’avoir fait le malheur de leur fils en l’attelant à une haridelle semblable, dont les harnais ne valaient pas la peau. Ils vinrent à Tostes. On s’expliqua. Il y eut des scènes. Héloïse, en pleurs, se jetant dans les bras de son mari, le conjura de la défendre de ses parents. Charles voulut parler pour elle. Ceux-ci se fâchèrent, et ils partirent.","It happened that at the beginning of spring, a notary from Ingouville, holder of the widow Dubuc's funds, embarked on a fine tide, taking with him all the money for his office. Héloïse, it is true, still owned, besides a share of the boat valued at six thousand francs, her house in the Rue Saint-François; and yet, of all this fortune which had been made to ring so high, nothing, except a little furniture and a few clothes, had appeared in the household. It had to be cleared up. The house in Dieppe was found to be worm-eaten with mortgages even to its pilings; what she had taken to the notary, God alone knew, and the share of the boat did not exceed a thousand crowns. So she had lied, the good lady! In his exasperation, M. Bovary senior, smashing a chair against the cobblestones, accused his wife of having made their son's misfortune by harnessing him to a similar haridelle, whose harnesses were not worth the skin. They came to Tostes. We explained. There were scenes. Heloise, in tears, throwing herself into her husband's arms, besought him to defend her from her parents. Charles wanted to speak for her. They got angry, and they left.","It happened that early in the spring, a notary in Ingouville, custodian of the Widow Dubuc’s capital, sailed off on a favorable tide, taking away with him all the money in his keeping. Héloïse, it is true, also possessed, besides a share in a ship valued at six thousand francs, her house in the rue Saint-François; and yet, of all that fortune that had been so loudly vaunted, nothing, except a few pieces of furniture and some rags of clothing, had ever appeared in the household. The thing had to be cleared up. The house in Dieppe was found to be riddled with mortgages down to its pilings; what she had placed with the notary, God only knew, and her share in the ship did not amount to more than a thousand ecus. So she had lied, the fine lady! In his anger, the elder Monsieur Bovary, breaking a chair on the flagstones, accused his wife of having brought calamity down upon their son by hitching him to an old nag whose harness wasn’t 			worth her skin. They came to Tostes. They had it out. There were scenes. Héloïse, in tears, throwing herself into her husband’s arms, begged him to defend her from his parents. Charles tried to speak up for her. His parents became furious, and they left.","Early in the spring it happened that a notary in Ingouville, custodian of the Widow Dubuc’s capital, sailed away one day, taking with him all his clients’ money.

Now, inevitably, everything came under investigation. The house in Dieppe, it turned out, was mortgaged up to its eaves; what she had placed with the notary, God only knew; and her share in the boat didn’t amount to more than three thousand. So she’d been lying—lying all along, the dear, good lady! In his rage the older Monsieur Bovary dashed a chair to pieces on the floor and accused his wife of ruining their son’s life by yoking him to such an ancient nag, whose harness was worth even less than her carcass. They came to Tostes. The four of them had it out. There were scenes. The weeping Heloise threw herself into her husband’s arms and appealed to him to defend her against his parents. Charles began to take her part. The others flew into a rage and left."

"Loin de s’ennuyer au couvent les premiers temps, elle se plut dans la société des bonnes sœurs, qui, pour l’amuser, la conduisaient dans la chapelle, où l’on pénétrait du réfectoire par un long corridor. Elle jouait fort peu durant les récréations, comprenait bien le catéchisme, et c’est elle qui répondait toujours à M. le vicaire dans les questions difficiles. Vivant donc sans jamais sortir de la tiède atmosphère des classes et parmi ces femmes au teint blanc portant des chapelets à croix de cuivre, elle s’assoupit doucement à la langueur mystique qui s’exhale des parfums de l’autel, de la fraîcheur des bénitiers et du rayonnement des cierges. Au lieu de suivre la messe, elle regardait dans son livre les vignettes pieuses bordées d’azur, et elle aimait la brebis malade, le Sacré-Cœur percé de flèches aiguës, ou le pauvre Jésus, qui tombe en marchant sur sa croix.

Living therefore without ever leaving the warm atmosphere of the classrooms and among these white-faced women wearing rosaries with copper crosses, she dozes gently in the mystical languor which is exhaled from the perfumes of the altar, from the freshness of the stoups and the radiance of candles. Instead of following the mass, she looked in her book at the pious vignettes bordered with azure, and she loved the sick sheep, the Sacred Heart pierced with sharp arrows, or poor Jesus, who falls while walking on his cross.

And, besides, that does not surprise me; because, you, gentlemen pharmacists, you are constantly stuffed in your kitchen, which must end up altering your temperament. Look at me instead: every day, I get up at four o'clock, I do my beard with cold water (I'm never cold), and I don't wear flannels, I don't catch any colds, the box is good! I live sometimes in one way, sometimes in another, as a philosopher, at random from the fork.

I eat well one day, badly the next, however it comes. I take it philosophically. That’s why I’m not a bit squeamish, like you.

"Jamais madame Bovary ne fut aussi belle qu’à cette époque ; elle avait cette indéfinissable beauté qui résulte de la joie, de l’enthousiasme, du succès, et qui n’est que l’harmonie du tempérament avec les circonstances. Ses convoitises, ses chagrins, l’expérience du plaisir et ses illusions toujours jeunes, comme font aux fleurs le fumier, la pluie, les vents et le soleil, l’avaient par gradations développée, et elle s’épanouissait enfin dans la plénitude de sa nature. Ses paupières semblaient taillées tout exprès pour ses longs regards amoureux où la prunelle se perdait, tandis qu’un souffle fort écartait ses narines minces et relevait le coin charnu de ses lèvres, qu’ombrageait à la lumière un peu de duvet noir. On eût dit qu’un artiste habile en corruptions avait disposé sur sa nuque la torsade de ses cheveux : ils s’enroulaient en une masse lourde, négligemment, et selon les hasards de l’adultère, qui les dénouait tous les jours.

Her eyelids seemed shaped expressly for those long, loving glances in which her pupils would disappear, while a heavy sigh would widen her delicate nostrils and lift the fleshy corners of her lips, shadowed, in the light, by a trace of dark down. Some artist skilled in depravity might have arranged the coil of her hair over the nape of her neck; it was looped in a heavy mass, carelessly, according to the chance dictates of her adulterous affair, which loosened it every day. Her voice now took on softer 			inflections, her body, too; something subtle and penetrating emanated even from the folds of her dress and the arch of her foot. Charles, as in the early days of his marriage, found her delicious and quite irresistible.","Never had Madame Bovary been as beautiful as now. She had that indefinable beauty that comes from happiness, enthusiasm, success—a beauty that is nothing more or less than a harmony of temperament and circumstances. Her desires, her sorrows, her experience of sensuality, her evergreen illusions, had developed her step by step, like a flower nourished by manure and by the rain, by the wind and the sun; and she was finally blooming in the fullness of her nature. Her eyelids seemed strangely perfect when she half closed them in a long amorous glance; and each of her deep sighs dilated her fine nostrils and raised the fleshy corners of her lips, lightly shadowed by dark down. Some artist skilled in corruption seemed to have designed the knot of her hair; it lay on her neck coiled in a heavy mass, twisted carelessly and always a little differently, for every day it was loosened by embraces. Her voice now took on softer inflections; her body, too; something subtle and penetrating emanated from the very folds of her dress, from the very arch of her foot. Charles found her exquisite and utterly irresistible, as in the first days of their marriage."

"Lorsque la partie de cartes était finie, l’apothicaire et le médecin jouaient aux dominos, et Emma changeant de place, s’accoudait sur la table, à feuilleter l’Illustration. Elle avait apporté son journal de modes. Léon se mettait près d’elle ; ils regardaient ensemble les gravures et s’attendaient au bas des pages. Souvent elle le priait de lui lire des vers ; Léon les déclamait d’une voix traînante et qu’il faisait expirer soigneusement aux passages d’amour. Mais le bruit des dominos le contrariait ; M. Homais y était fort, il battait Charles à plein double-six. Puis, les trois centaines terminées, ils s’allongeaient tous deux devant le foyer et ne tardaient pas à s’endormir. Le feu se mourait dans les cendres ; la théière était vide ; Léon lisait encore. Emma l’écoutait, en faisant tourner machinalement l’abat-jour de la lampe, où étaient peints sur la gaze des pierrots dans des voitures et des danseuses de corde, avec leurs balanciers. Léon s’arrêtait, désignant d’un geste son auditoire endormi, alors ils se parlaient à voix basse, et la conversation qu’ils avaient leur semblait plus douce, parce qu’elle n’était pas entendue.","When the game of cards was over, the apothecary and the doctor played dominoes, and Emma, changing places, leaned on the table, leafing through the Illustration. She had brought her fashion journal. Leon sat down beside her; they looked together at the engravings and waited at the bottom of the pages. She often asked him to read her verses; Léon declaimed them in a drawling voice, which he let out carefully at the passages of love. But the noise of the dominoes annoyed him; Mr. Homais was strong there, he beat Charles at full double-six. Then, the three hundred finished, they both stretched out in front of the hearth and soon fell asleep. The fire was dying in the ashes; the teapot was empty; Leon was still reading. Emma listened to him, mechanically turning the shade of the lamp, on which were painted on the gauze pierrots in carriages and tightrope walkers with their pendulums. Leon would stop, pointing with a gesture to his sleeping audience, then they would talk to each other in low voices, and the conversation they were having seemed to them sweeter, because it was not overheard.","When the card game was finished, the apothecary and the doctor would play dominoes, and Emma would move to another chair, lean her elbows on the table, and leaf through L’Illustration. She had brought along her fashion magazine. Léon would sit down next to her; they would look at the pictures together and wait for each other at the bottoms of the pages. Often she would ask him to read some poems to her; Léon would declaim them in a languid voice, which he would carefully let die away at the love passages. But the noise of the dominoes interfered; Monsieur Homais was good at the game, he would beat Charles by a full double six. Then, having reached three hundred, the two of them would stretch out in front of the fireplace and soon fall asleep. The fire was dying down in the embers; the teapot was empty; Léon was still reading. Emma would listen to him, absently turning the lampshade, its gauze painted with 			Pierrots in carriages and tightrope dancers with their balancing poles.

"Le coude sur la longue planche où elle repassait, il considérait avidement toutes ces affaires de femmes étalées autour de lui : les jupons de basin, les fichus, les collerettes, et les pantalons à coulisse, vastes de hanches et qui se rétrécissaient par le bas.","His elbow on the long board where she was ironing, he eagerly considered all the women's things spread out around him: the basin petticoats, the neckerchiefs, the collarettes, and the drawstring trousers, wide at the hips and which narrowed at the bottom. .","His elbow on the long board where she was ironing, he would stare avidly at all these women’s things spread out around him: the dimity petticoats, the fichus, the collars, and the drawstring pantalets, vast at the hips and narrowing lower down. “What’s this for?”","His elbows on the ironing board, he would stare hungrily at all the feminine garments strewn about him—the dimity petticoats, the fichus, the collars, the drawstring pantaloons enormously wide at the waist and narrowing below. “What is this for?”"

"Elle souhaitait un fils ; il serait fort et brun, elle l’appellerait Georges ; et cette idée d’avoir pour enfant un mâle était comme la revanche en espoir de toutes ses impuissances passées. Un homme, au moins, est libre ; il peut parcourir les passions et les pays, traverser les obstacles, mordre aux bonheurs les plus lointains. Mais une femme est empêchée continuellement. Inerte et flexible à la fois, elle a contre elle les mollesses de la chair avec les dépendances de la loi.

A man, at least, is free; he can explore every passion, every land, overcome obstacles, taste the most distant pleasures. But a woman is continually thwarted. Inert and pliant at the same time, she must struggle against both the softness of her flesh and subjection to the law. Her will, like the veil tied to her hat by a string, flutters with every breeze; there is always some desire luring her on, some convention holding her back.","She wanted a son. He would be strong and dark; she would call him Georges; and this idea of having a male child was like a promise of compensation for all her past frustrations.

"Cependant la volupté de sa douleur était incomplète, car il n’avait autour de lui personne qui la partageât ; et il faisait des visites à la mère Lefrançois afin de pouvoir parler d’elle.

"Le soir, à l’Étude, il tira ses bouts de manches de son pupitre, mit en ordre ses petites affaires, régla soigneusement son papier. Nous le vîmes qui travaillait en conscience, cherchant tous les mots dans le dictionnaire et se donnant beaucoup de mal. Grâce, sans doute, à cette bonne volonté dont il fit preuve, il dut de ne pas descendre dans la classe inférieure ; car, s’il savait passablement ses règles, il n’avait guère d’élégance dans les tournures. C’était le curé de son village qui lui avait commencé le latin, ses parents, par économie, ne l’ayant envoyé au collège que le plus tard possible.","In the evening, at the Etude, he pulled out his ends of his sleeves from his desk, put his little things in order, carefully arranged his paper. We saw him working conscientiously, looking up all the words in the dictionary and going to great lengths.

It was the priest of his village who had taught him Latin, his parents, to save money, having sent him to college as late as possible.","That evening, in Study Hall, he drew his cuff guards from his desk, put his little things in order, carefully ruled his paper. We saw him working conscientiously, looking up all the words in the dictionary and taking great pains. Thanks, no doubt, to this willingness he displayed, he did not have to go down into the lower class; for while he knew his rules passably well, he had almost no elegance in his constructions. It was the curé of his village who had started him on Latin, his parents, for reasons of economy, having delayed as long as possible sending him to school.","That evening, in study period, he took his sleeveguards from his desk, arranged his meager equipment, and carefully ruled his paper. We saw him working conscientiously, looking up every word in the dictionary, taking great pains. It was doubtless thanks to this display of effort that he was not demoted to a lower form. For while he had a fair knowledge of grammatical rules, his translations lacked elegance.

"Afin de ressaisir quelque chose d’elle, il alla chercher dans l’armoire, au chevet de son lit, une vieille boîte à biscuits de Reims où il enfermait d’habitude ses lettres de femmes, et il s’en échappa une odeur de poussière humide et de roses flétries. D’abord il aperçut un mouchoir de poche, couvert de gouttelettes pâles. C’était un mouchoir à elle, une fois qu’elle avait saigné du nez, en promenade ; il ne s’en souvenait plus. Il y avait auprès, se cognant à tous les angles, la miniature donnée par Emma ; sa toilette lui parut prétentieuse et son regard en coulisse du plus pitoyable effet ; puis, à force de considérer cette image et d’évoquer le souvenir du modèle, les traits d’Emma peu à peu se confondirent en sa mémoire, comme si la figure vivante et la figure peinte, se frottant l’une contre l’autre, se fussent réciproquement effacées. Enfin il lut de ses lettres ; elles étaient pleines d’explications relatives à leur voyage, courtes, techniques et pressantes comme des billets d’affaires. Il voulut revoir les longues, celles d’autrefois ; pour les trouver au fond de la boîte, Rodolphe dérangea toutes les autres ; et machinalement il se mit à fouiller dans ce tas de papiers et de choses, y retrouvant pêle-mêle des bouquets, une jarretière, un masque noir, des épingles et des cheveux – des cheveux ! de bruns, de blonds ; quelques-uns même, s’accrochant à la ferrure de la boîte, se cassaient quand on l’ouvrait.","In order to recapture something of her, he went to look in the cupboard, at the head of his bed, for an old biscuit tin from Reims where he usually locked up his letters from women, and from it escaped a smell of damp dust and withered roses. First he saw a pocket handkerchief, covered with pale droplets. It was a handkerchief of hers, once her nose had bled on a walk; he no longer remembered. Nearby, bumping into each other, was the miniature given by Emma; her toilet seemed to her pretentious and her glance behind the scenes of the most pitiful effect; then, by dint of considering this image and evoking the memory of the model, Emma's features gradually merged in her memory, as if the living figure and the painted figure, rubbing against each other , would have been reciprocally erased. Finally he read his letters; they were full of explanations relating to their trip, short, technical and pressing like business tickets. He wanted to see the long ones again, those of the past; to find them at the bottom of the box, Rodolphe disturbed all the others; and mechanically he began to rummage through this heap of papers and things, finding pell-mell bouquets, a garter, a black mask, pins and hair – hair! browns, blondes; some even, clinging to the fittings of the box, broke when opened.","To recapture something of her, he went to the cupboard by the head of his bed and took out an old Reims cookie tin in which he was in the habit of putting the letters women sent to him, and there escaped from it a smell of damp dust and withered roses. First he saw a pocket handkerchief covered with pale droplets. It was one of hers, from when she had had a nosebleed, once when they were out together; he had forgotten. Near it, knocking against the corners of the box, was the miniature Emma had given him; he found her clothing pretentious and her sidelong gaze most pitiful in its effect; then, because he had been studying this picture and summoning up a recollection of its original, Emma’s features gradually became confused in his memory, as if the living face and the painted face, rubbing together, had obliterated each other. Finally he read some of her letters; they were full of explanations concerning their trip, as short, 			technical, and urgent as business letters. He wanted to look at the long ones again, the ones from earlier times; in order to find them at the bottom of the tin, Rodolphe disturbed all the others; and mechanically he began rummaging through the pile of papers and other things, rediscovering in disarray some bouquets, a garter, a black mask, pins, and hair—hair!—brown, blond, some of which, even, caught on the iron fittings of the box and broke when it was opened.","In order to recapture some feeling of her he went to the wardrobe at the head of his bed and took out an old Rheims biscuit box that was his storage place for letters from women. Out of it came a smell of damp dust and withered roses. The first thing his eye fell on was a handkerchief spotted with faint stains. It was one of Emma’s: she had had a nosebleed one day when they were out together—he hadn’t remembered it till now. Then he took up something that had been knocking against the sides of the box: it was the miniature she had given him; she looked much too fussily dressed, he thought, and her ogling expression was preposterous. He kept staring at the artist’s handiwork in an attempt to evoke the model as he remembered her, and this gradually resulted in Emma’s features becoming confused in his memory, as though the real face and the painted face had been rubbing against each other and wearing each other away. Finally he read some of her letters. They were as brief, as technical, as urgent as business letters, filled chiefly with details pertaining to their trip. He wanted to reread the longer ones, the earlier ones; they were further down in the box, and to get at them he had to disarrange everything else. He found himself mechanically going through the pile of letters and other things, turning up a heterogeneous assortment—bouquets, a garter, a black mask, pins, locks of hair. So many locks of hair! Brunette and blond: some of them, catching in the metal hinges of the box, had broken off as he opened it."
"Elle rencontra, sur la place, Lestiboudois, qui s’en revenait ; car, pour ne pas rogner la journée, il préférait interrompre sa besogne puis la reprendre, si bien qu’il tintait l’Angelus selon sa commodité.

"Elle se demandait tout en marchant : « Que vais-je dire ? Par où commencerai-je ? » Et à mesure qu’elle avançait, elle reconnaissait les buissons, les arbres, les joncs marins sur la colline, le château là-bas. Elle se retrouvait dans les sensations de sa première tendresse, et son pauvre cœur comprimé s’y dilatait amoureusement. Un vent tiède lui soufflait au visage ; la neige, se fondant, tombait goutte à goutte des bourgeons sur l’herbe.","She wondered as she walked, “What am I going to say? Where shall I start? And as she went on, she recognized the bushes, the trees, the sea reeds on the hill, the castle over there.

A warm wind blew in his face; the snow, melting, dripped from the buds onto the grass.","She asked herself, as she walked: “What am I going to say? Where will I begin?” And as she came closer, she recognized the shrubs, the trees, the furze on the hill, the château beyond.

A warm wind was blowing in her face; melting snow dripped from the leaf-buds onto the grass."
"Cependant, au haut bout de la table, seul parmi toutes ces femmes, courbé sur son assiette remplie, et la serviette nouée dans le dos comme un enfant, un vieillard mangeait, laissant tomber de sa bouche des gouttes de sauce. Il avait les yeux éraillés et portait une petite queue enroulée d’un ruban noir. C’était le beau-père du marquis, le vieux duc de Laverdière, l’ancien favori du comte d’Artois, dans le temps des parties de chasse au Vaudreuil, chez le marquis de Conflans, et qui avait été, disait-on, l’amant de la reine Marie-Antoinette entre MM. de Coigny et de Lauzun. Il avait mené une vie bruyante de débauches, pleine de duels, de paris, de femmes enlevées, avait dévoré sa fortune et effrayé toute sa famille. Un domestique, derrière sa chaise, lui nommait tout haut, dans l’oreille, les plats qu’il désignait du doigt en bégayant ; et sans cesse les yeux d’Emma revenaient d’eux-mêmes sur ce vieil homme à lèvres pendantes comme sur quelque chose d’extraordinaire et d’auguste. Il avait vécu à la Cour et couché dans le lit des reines !","Meanwhile, at the top end of the table, alone among all these women, bent over his full plate and his napkin tied behind his back like a child, an old man was eating, letting drops of sauce fall from his mouth. He had sunken eyes and wore a small tail wrapped in a black ribbon. He was the Marquis's father-in-law, the old Duc de Laverdière, the Comte d'Artois' former favorite, in the days of the hunting parties at Vaudreuil, at the Marquis de Conflans's, and who had been, it was said, , the lover of Queen Marie-Antoinette between MM. of Coigny and Lauzun. He had led a noisy life of debauchery, full of duels, bets, kidnapped women, had devoured his fortune and frightened his whole family. A servant, behind his chair, named aloud to him, in his ear, the dishes which he pointed to with his finger, stammering; and Emma's eyes constantly returned of their own accord to this old man with hanging lips as to something extraordinary and august. He had lived at Court and slept in the beds of queens!","Meanwhile, at the head of the table, alone among all these women, bent over his full plate, his napkin knotted behind him like a child, an old man sat eating, drops of sauce falling from his mouth. His eyes were rimmed with red, and he wore his hair in a short pigtail wound in black ribbon. This was the Marquis’s father-in-law, the old Duc de Laverdière, once a favorite of the Comte d’Artois, in the days of the hunting parties at Le Vaudreuil, home of the Marquis de Conflans, and he had been, they said, the lover of Queen Marie Antoinette, between Monsieur de Coigny and Monsieur de Lauzun. He had led a riotous life of debauchery, filled with duels, wagers, abductions of women, he had devoured his fortune and alarmed all his family. A servant, behind his chair, named loudly in his ear the dishes he pointed at with his finger, stammering; and Emma’s eyes returned again and again of their own accord to this old man with his pendulous lips, 			as to something extraordinary and august. He had lived at Court and slept in the beds of queens!","At the head of the table, along among ladies, was an old man. His napkin was tied around his neck like a child’s, and he sat hunched over his heaped plate, gravy dribbling from his mouth. The underlids of his eyes hung down and showed red inside, and he wore his hair in a little pigtail wound with black ribbon. This was the marquis’ father-in-law, the old due de Laverdière, favorite of the due d’Artois in the days of the marquis de Conflans’ hunting parties at Le Vaudreuil: he was said to have been Marie-Antoinette’s lover between Monsieur de Coigny and Monsieur de Lauzun. He had led a wild, dissipated life, filled with duels, wagers and abductions; he had gone through his money and been the terror of his family. Now, muttering unintelligibly, he pointed his finger at one dish after another, and a servant standing behind his chair shouted their names in his ear. Emma’s eyes kept coming back to this pendulous-lipped old man as though he were someone extraordinary, someone august. He had lived at court! He had slept with a queen!"

"Comme ils aimaient cette bonne chambre pleine de gaieté, malgré sa splendeur un peu fanée ! Ils retrouvaient toujours les meubles à leur place, et parfois des épingles à cheveux qu’elle avait oubliées, l’autre jeudi, sous le socle de la pendule. Ils déjeunaient au coin du feu, sur un petit guéridon incrusté de palissandre. Emma découpait, lui mettait les morceaux dans son assiette en débitant toutes sortes de chatteries ; et elle riait d’un rire sonore et libertin quand la mousse du vin de Champagne débordait du verre léger sur les bagues de ses doigts. Ils étaient si complètement perdus en la possession d’eux-mêmes, qu’ils se croyaient là dans leur maison particulière, et devant y vivre jusqu’à la mort, comme deux éternels jeunes époux. Ils disaient notre chambre, notre tapis, nos fauteuils, même elle disait mes pantoufles, un cadeau de Léon, une fantaisie qu’elle avait eue. C’étaient des pantoufles en satin rose, bordées de cygne.

They always found the furniture in its place, and sometimes hairpins that she had forgotten the other Thursday, under the base of the clock. They were having lunch by the fireside, on a small pedestal table inlaid with rosewood. Emma cut them up, put the pieces on his plate for him, spitting out all sorts of cattery; and she laughed a sonorous and libertine laugh when the foam of the champagne wine overflowed from the light glass on the rings of her fingers. They were so completely lost in possession of themselves that they thought they were there in their private house, and must live there until death, like two eternal young spouses. They said our room, our rug, our armchairs, she even said my slippers, a gift from Leon, a fancy she had had. They were pink satin slippers, trimmed with swans. When she sat down on his knees, her leg, then too short, hung in the air; and the dainty shoe, which had no quarter, clung only by the toes to his bare foot.","How they loved that dear room, so full of gaiety despite its somewhat faded splendor!

"Un jour qu’errant sans but dans la maison, il était monté jusqu’au grenier, il sentit sous sa pantoufle une boulette de papier fin. Il l’ouvrit et il lut : « Du courage, Emma ! du courage ! Je ne veux pas faire le malheur de votre existence. » C’était la lettre de Rodolphe, tombée à terre entre des caisses, qui était restée là, et que le vent de la lucarne venait de pousser vers la porte. Et Charles demeura tout immobile et béant à cette même place où jadis, encore plus pâle que lui, Emma, désespérée, avait voulu mourir. Enfin, il découvrit un petit R au bas de la seconde page. Qu’était-ce ? il se rappela les assiduités de Rodolphe, sa disparition soudaine et l’air contraint qu’il avait eu en la rencontrant depuis, deux ou trois fois. Mais le ton respectueux de la lettre l’illusionna.","One day, wandering aimlessly in the house, he had gone up to the attic, he felt under his slipper a ball of thin paper.

Finally, he discovered a small R at the bottom of the second page. What was it? he remembered Rodolphe's assiduous attendance, her sudden disappearance, and the constrained air he had had on meeting her two or three times since then.

"Ce fut dans le village un événement considérable que cette amputation de cuisse par le docteur Canivet !

"L’apothicaire, autrefois, se fût bien gardé d’une telle expression ; mais il donnait maintenant dans un genre folâtre et parisien qu’il trouvait du meilleur goût ; et, comme madame Bovary, sa voisine, il interrogeait le clerc curieusement sur les mœurs de la capitale, même il parlait argot afin d’éblouir… les bourgeois, disant turne, bazar, chicard, chicandard, Breda-street, et Je me la casse, pour : Je m’en vais.","The apothecary, formerly, would have taken good care of such an expression; but he now gave in a playful and Parisian style which he found in the best taste; and, like Madame Bovary, his neighbour, he questioned the clerk curiously about the manners of the capital, he even spoke slang in order to dazzle… the bourgeois, saying turne, bazar, chicard, chicandard, Breda-street, and Je me la breakage, for: I'm leaving.","In earlier times, the apothecary would have carefully avoided such an expression; but he was now inclined toward a playful Parisian style, which he found in better taste; and, like his neighbor Madame Bovary, he would examine the clerk inquisitively about the customs of the capital; he even used slang to dazzle … the bourgeoisie, saying “turne” (digs), “bazar” (stuff), “chicard” (classy), “chicandard” (most classy), “Breda-street” (red-light district), and “Je me la casse” (I’m hoofing it) for “I’m going now.”","In the past, the apothecary would have been careful to avoid such an expression; but now he was going in for a daredevil, Parisian kind of language that he considered very à la mode, and like his neighbor Madame Bovary he asked the clerk many searching questions about life in the big city.

"Cette idée de spectacle germa vite dans la tête de Bovary ; car aussitôt il en fit part à sa femme, qui refusa tout d’abord, alléguant la fatigue, le dérangement, la dépense ; mais, par extraordinaire, Charles ne céda pas, tant il jugeait cette récréation lui devoir être profitable. Il n’y voyait aucun empêchement ; sa mère leur avait expédié trois cents francs sur lesquels il ne comptait plus, les dettes courantes n’avaient rien d’énorme, et l’échéance des billets à payer au sieur Lheureux était encore si longue, qu’il n’y fallait pas songer. D’ailleurs, imaginant qu’elle y mettait de la délicatesse, Charles insista davantage ; si bien qu’elle finit, à force d’obsessions, par se décider. Et, le lendemain, à huit heures, ils s’emballèrent dans l’hirondelle.","This idea of a show quickly germinated in Bovary's head; for he immediately told his wife, who at first refused, alleging fatigue, inconvenience, and expense; but, extraordinarily, Charles did not yield, so much did he judge this recreation to be profitable to him.

Besides, imagining that she put some delicacy into it, Charles insisted more; so much so that she ends up, by dint of obsessions, by making up her mind. And the next day, at eight o'clock, they got carried away in the swallow.","This idea of the theater quickly germinated in Bovary’s mind; for he at once communicated it to his wife, who at first refused, pleading the fatigue, the bother, the expense; but exceptionally, Charles did not give in, so convinced was he that this diversion would do her good. He saw nothing standing in the way of it; his mother had sent them three hundred francs that he had given up hope of getting, their current debts were not enormous, and the due date of the notes to be paid to Sieur Lheureux was still so far off that he did not have to think about them. Besides, imagining that she was merely being tactful about this, he continued to insist; so that in the end, because of his importunity, she decided to do it. And the next day, at eight o’clock in the morning, they bundled themselves into the Hirondelle.","The idea of the opera took rapid root in Bovary’s mind. He lost no time suggesting it to his wife. She shook her head, pleading fatigue, trouble and expense; but for once Charles didn’t give in, so convinced was he that she would benefit from the excursion. He saw no reason for them not to go: his mother had sent him three hundred francs they had given up hope of getting, their debts of the moment were nothing tremendous, and Lheureux’s notes weren’t due for so long that there was no use thinking about them. Fancying that Emma was refusing out of consideration for him, Charles insisted the more strongly, and finally she gave in. The next day, at eight in the morning, they bundled themselves into the Hirondelle."
"Il appartenait à la grande école chirurgicale sortie du tablier de Bichat, à cette génération, maintenant disparue, de praticiens philosophes qui, chérissant leur art d’un amour fanatique, l’exerçaient avec exaltation et sagacité ! Tout tremblait dans son hôpital quand il se mettait en colère, et ses élèves le vénéraient si bien, qu’ils s’efforçaient, à peine établis, de l’imiter le plus possible ; de sorte que l’on retrouvait sur eux, par les villes d’alentour, sa longue douillette de mérinos et son large habit noir, dont les parements déboutonnés couvraient un peu ses mains charnues, de fort belles mains, et qui n’avaient jamais de gants, comme pour être plus promptes à plonger dans les misères. Dédaigneux des croix, des titres et des académies, hospitalier, libéral, paternel avec les pauvres et pratiquant la vertu sans y croire, il eût presque passé pour un saint si la finesse de son esprit ne l’eût fait craindre comme un démon. Son regard, plus tranchant que ses bistouris, vous descendait droit dans l’âme et désarticulait tout mensonge à travers les allégations et les pudeurs. Et il allait ainsi, plein de cette majesté débonnaire que donnent la conscience d’un grand talent, de la fortune, et quarante ans d’une existence laborieuse et irréprochable.","He belonged to the great surgical school that emerged from Bichat's apron, to that generation, now extinct, of philosophical practitioners who, cherishing their art with a fanatical love, exercised it with exaltation and sagacity! Everything trembled in his hospital when he got angry, and his pupils venerated him so well that they tried, as soon as they were established, to imitate him as much as possible; so that one found on them, in the surrounding towns, his long cozy merino jacket and his wide black coat, the unbuttoned facings of which somewhat covered his fleshy hands, very beautiful hands, and which had never gloves, as if to be quicker to plunge into misery. Disdainful of crosses, titles and academies, hospitable, liberal, paternal with the poor and practicing virtue without believing in it, he would almost have passed for a saint if the delicacy of his mind had not made him feared like a demon. His gaze, sharper than his scalpels, went straight down to your soul and disarticulated any lies through allegations and modesty. And so he went, full of that good-natured majesty which comes from the consciousness of great talent, of fortune, and forty years of an industrious and irreproachable existence.","He belonged to that great school of surgery inspired by Bichat, to that now-vanished generation of philosopher-practitioners who cherished their art with a fanatical love and practiced it with enthusiasm and sagacity! The entire hospital shook when he flew into a rage, and his pupils revered him so deeply that as soon as they established themselves, they would endeavor to imitate him as closely as possible; thus, in the surrounding towns, one would recognize, on their backs, his long quilted merino overcoat and his ample black tailcoat, whose unbuttoned cuffs partly covered his fleshy hands—his very fine hands, always gloveless, as though to be more prepared to plunge into human suffering. Disdainful of medals, titles, and academies, hospitable, generous, fatherly toward the poor, and practicing virtue without believing in it, he would almost have passed for a saint had not the shrewdness of his mind made him feared like a devil. His 			gaze, keener than his lancet, would descend straight into your soul, past your excuses and your reticence, and disarticulate your every lie. And so he went on from day to day, full of the easy majesty that comes from an awareness of great talent, from wealth, and from forty years of an irreproachable life of hard work.","He belonged to that great surgical school created by Bichat—that generation, now vanished, of philosopher-practitioners, who cherished their art with fanatical love and applied it with enthusiasm and sagacity. Everyone in his hospital trembled when he was angry; and his students so revered him that the moment they set up for themselves they imitated him as much as they could. There was scarcely a town in the district where one of them couldn’t be found, wearing a long merino overcoat and a full black tail coat, exactly like his. Doctor Larivière’s unbuttoned cuffs partly covered his fleshy hands—extraordinary hands, always ungloved, as though to be the readier to grapple with suffering. Disdainful of decorations, titles and academies, hospitable, generous, a father to the poor, practicing Christian virtues although an unbeliever, he might have been thought of as a saint if he hadn’t been feared as a devil because of the keenness of his mind. His scalpel-sharp glance cut deep into your soul, exposing any lie buried under excuses and reticences. His manner was majestic and genial, conscious as he was of his great gifts and his wealth and the forty years of hard work and blameless living he had behind him."

"– Ni moi ! reprit vivement M. Homais, quoiqu’il lui faudra pourtant suivre les autres, au risque de passer pour un jésuite. Et vous ne savez pas la vie que mènent ces farceurs-là, dans le quartier Latin, avec les actrices ! Du reste, les étudiants sont fort bien vus à Paris. Pour peu qu’ils aient quelque talent d’agrément, on les reçoit dans les meilleures sociétés, et il y a même des dames du faubourg Saint-Germain qui en deviennent amoureuses, ce qui leur fournit, par la suite, les occasions de faire de très beaux mariages.","- Nor me ! replied M. Homais eagerly, although he would have to follow the others, at the risk of passing for a Jesuit. And you don't know the life these pranksters lead in the Latin Quarter with the actresses! Moreover, the students are very well seen in Paris. As long as they have some talent for charm, they are received in the best societies, and there are even ladies of the Faubourg Saint-Germain who fall in love with them, which subsequently provides them with opportunities to make very beautiful weddings.","“I don’t think he’ll do anything wrong,” objected Charles. “Nor do I!” Monsieur Homais said quickly; “though he’ll have to go along with the others, if he’s not to risk looking like a Jesuit. And you don’t know the sort of life those young devils lead in the Latin Quarter, with their actresses! Anyway, students are very highly regarded in Paris. If they have any talent at all for making themselves agreeable, they’re received in the best circles, and in fact the ladies in the Faubourg Saint-Germain tend to fall in love with them, which gives them the chance, subsequently, to contract some very fine marriages.”","“I don’t think he’ll do anything wrong,” Bovary objected. “Nor do I,” Monsieur Homais said quickly, “but he’ll have to go along with the others if he doesn’t want to be taken for a Jesuit.

"Charles était triste : la clientèle n’arrivait pas. Il demeurait assis pendant de longues heures, sans parler, allait dormir dans son cabinet ou regardait coudre sa femme. Pour se distraire, il s’employa chez lui comme homme de peine, et même il essaya de peindre le grenier avec un reste de couleur que les peintres avaient laissé. Mais les affaires d’argent le préoccupaient. Il en avait tant dépensé pour les réparations de Tostes, pour les toilettes de Madame et pour le déménagement, que toute la dot, plus de trois mille écus, s’était écoulée en deux ans. Puis, que de choses endommagées ou perdues dans le transport de Tostes à Yonville, sans compter le curé de plâtre, qui, tombant de la charrette à un cahot trop fort, s’était écrasé en mille morceaux sur le pavé de Quincampoix !","Charles was sad: the customers weren't arriving. He sat for long hours without speaking, went to sleep in his study or watched his wife sew. To amuse himself, he employed himself at home as a laborer, and he even tried to paint the attic with a residue of color that the painters had left behind. But money matters preoccupied him. He had spent so much on the repairs at Tostes, on Madame's toilets, and on the removal, that the whole dowry, more than three thousand crowns, had been spent in two years. Then, how many things were damaged or lost in the transport from Tostes to Yonville, not to mention the plaster priest, who, falling from the cart too hard, had crashed into a thousand pieces on the pavement of Quincampoix!","Charles was gloomy: he had no patients. He would remain sitting for hours on end, without speaking; he would go nap in his consulting room or watch his wife sew. For distraction, he did odd jobs around the house, and he even attempted to paint the attic with a remnant of color left by the painters. But money matters preoccupied him. He had spent so much on the repairs at Tostes, on Madame’s clothes, and on the move that the entire dowry, more than three thousand ecus, had melted away in two years. And then, how many things had been damaged or lost on the way from Tostes to Yonville, quite aside from the plaster curé, which, knocked from the cart by a particularly hard jolt, had shattered into a thousand pieces on the pavement of Quincampoix!","Charles was in a gloomy state: he had no patients. He sat silent for hours on end, took naps in his consulting room, or watched his wife as she sewed. To keep occupied he acted as handyman around the house, even attempting to paint the attic with what the painters had left behind. But he was worried about money. He had spent so much for repairs at Tostes, for dresses for Madame, for the move, that the entire dowry and three thousand écus besides had been swallowed up in two years. Besides, so many things had been broken or lost between Tostes and Yonville! The plaster priest was one of them: a particularly violent bump had thrown it out of the van, and it had been smashed into a thousand pieces on the cobblestones of Quincampoix."
"Il se mit à vanter la vertu, le devoir et les immolations silencieuses, ayant lui-même un incroyable besoin de dévouement qu’il ne pouvait assouvir.","He began to extol virtue, duty and silent immolations, having himself an incredible need for devotion that he could not satisfy.","He began to extol virtue, duty, and silent renunciation, he himself having an incredible need for selfless dedication that he could not satisfy.","He launched into a eulogy of virtue, duty, silent renunciation: he, too, he said, had a fantastic need for selfless dedication that he was unable to satisfy."

"Cependant les flammes s’apaisèrent, soit que la provision d’elle-même s’épuisât, ou que l’entassement fût trop considérable. L’amour, peu à peu, s’éteignit par l’absence, le regret s’étouffa sous l’habitude ; et cette lueur d’incendie qui empourprait son ciel pâle se couvrit de plus d’ombre et s’effaça par degrés. Dans l’assoupissement de sa conscience, elle prit même les répugnances du mari pour des aspirations vers l’amant, les brûlures de la haine pour des réchauffements de la tendresse ; mais, comme l’ouragan soufflait toujours, et que la passion se consuma jusqu’aux cendres, et qu’aucun secours ne vint, qu’aucun soleil ne parut, il fut de tous côtés nuit complète, et elle demeura perdue dans un froid horrible qui la traversait.","However, the flames died down, either because the supply was exhausted, or because the heap was too great. Love, little by little, was extinguished by absence, regret was suffocated by habit; and that glow of fire which purpled her pale sky grew darker and faded away by degrees. In the drowsiness of her conscience, she even mistook the repugnance of the husband for aspirations towards the lover, the burnings of hatred for warmings of tenderness; but as the hurricane still blew, and passion burned to ashes, and no help came, no sun appeared, it was pitch dark on all sides, and she remained lost in a cold horrible that crossed it.","And yet the flames died down, either because the supply of fuel was exhausted or because too much was piled on. Little by little, love was extinguished by absence, longing smothered by routine; and the incendiary glow that had reddened her pale sky was covered over in shadow and by degrees faded away. In the torpor of her consciousness, she even misunderstood her feelings of repugnance for her husband to be yearnings for her lover, the scorching of hatred for the rekindling of affection; but since the storm continued to rage and her passion burned itself to ashes, and since no help came and no sun appeared, night closed in completely around her, and she remained lost in a terrible, piercing cold.","Nevertheless the flames did die down—whether exhausted from lack of supplies or choked by excessive feeding. Little by little, love was quenched by absence; regret was smothered by routine; and the fiery glow that had reddened her pale sky grew gray and gradually vanished. In this growing inner twilight she even mistook her recoil from her husband for an aspiration toward her lover, the searing waves of hatred for a rekindling of love. But the storm kept raging, her passion burned itself to ashes, no help was forthcoming, no new sun rose on the horizon. Night closed in completely around her, and she was left alone in a horrible void of piercing cold."

Then he recited the Misereatur and Undulgentiam, dipped his right thumb in oil, and began the anointings: first on the eyes, which had so coveted all earthly sumptuousness; then on the nostrils, fond of warm breezes and amorous scents; then on the mouth, which had opened for lies, which had groaned in pride and cried out in lust; then on the hands, which reveled in the gentle touch, and finally on the soles of the feet, once so quick when she ran to the satisfaction of her desires, and which now would no longer walk.","The priest rose to take up the crucifix; at that, she strained her neck forward like someone who is thirsty, and, pressing her lips to the body of the Man-God, she laid upon it with all her expiring strength the most passionate kiss of love she had ever given. Then he recited the Misereatur and the Indulgentiam, dipped his right thumb in the oil, and began the unctions: first on the eyes, which had so coveted all earthly splendors; then on the nostrils, so greedy for mild breezes and the smells of love; then on the mouth, which had opened to utter lies, which had moaned with pride and cried out in lust; then on the hands, which had so delighted in the touch of smooth material; and lastly on the soles of the feet, which had once been so quick when she hastened to satiate her desires and which now would never walk again.","The priest stood up and took the crucifix; she stretched out her head like someone thirsting; and pressing her lips to the body of the God-Man, she imprinted on it, with every ounce of her failing strength, the most passionate love-kiss she had ever given. Then he recited the Misereatur and the Indulgentiam, dipped his right thumb in the oil, and began the unctions. First he anointed her eyes, once so covetous of all earthly luxuries; then her nostrils, so gluttonous of caressing breezes and amorous scents; then her mouth, so prompt to lie, so defiant in pride, so loud in lust; then her hands, that had thrilled to voluptuous contacts; and finally the soles of her feet, once so swift when she had hastened to slake her desires, and now never to walk again."
"Mais elle était pleine de convoitises, de rage, de haine. Cette robe aux plis droits cachait un cœur bouleversé, et ces lèvres si pudiques n’en racontaient pas la tourmente. Elle était amoureuse de Léon, et elle recherchait la solitude, afin de pouvoir plus à l’aise se délecter en son image. La vue de sa personne troublait la volupté de cette méditation. Emma palpitait au bruit de ses pas ; puis, en sa présence, l’émotion tombait, et il ne lui restait ensuite qu’un immense étonnement qui se finissait en tristesse.","But she was full of lust, rage, hatred. This dress with straight pleats hid an upset heart, and these modest lips did not tell of the torment. She was in love with Leon, and she sought solitude, so that she could more comfortably delight in his image. The sight of his person troubled the voluptuousness of this meditation. Emma quivered at the sound of his footsteps; then, in his presence, the emotion subsided, and there remained only an immense astonishment which ended in sadness.","But she was filled with desires, with rage, with hatred. That dress with its straight folds concealed a heart in turmoil, and those reticent lips said nothing about its torment. She was in love with Léon, and she wanted to be alone so as to delight more comfortably in his image. The sight of him in person disturbed the sensual pleasure of this meditation. Emma trembled at the sound of his footsteps; then, in his presence, her emotions subsided, leaving only an immense astonishment that ended in sadness.","And all this time she was torn by wild desires, by rage, by hatred. The trim folds of her dress hid a heart in turmoil, and her reticent lips told nothing of the storm. She was in love with Léon, and she sought the solitude that allowed her to revel undisturbed in his image. The sight of his person spoiled the voluptuousness of her musings. She trembled at the sound of his footsteps; then, with him before her, the agitation subsided, and she was left with nothing but a vast bewilderment that turned gradually into sadness."
"Rodolphe était resté muet. Et Charles, la tête dans ses deux mains, reprit d’une voix éteinte et avec l’accent résigné des douleurs infinies :","Rodolphe had remained silent.

"Elle se retrouvait dans les lectures de sa jeunesse, en plein Walter Scott. Il lui semblait entendre, à travers le brouillard, le son des cornemuses écossaises se répéter sur les bruyères. D’ailleurs, le souvenir du roman facilitant l’intelligence du libretto, elle suivait l’intrigue phrase à phrase, tandis que d’insaisissables pensées qui lui revenaient, se dispersaient, aussitôt, sous les rafales de la musique. Elle se laissait aller au bercement des mélodies et se sentait elle-même vibrer de tout son être comme si les archets des violons se fussent promenés sur ses nerfs. Elle n’avait pas assez d’yeux pour contempler les costumes, les décors, les personnages, les arbres peints qui tremblaient quand on marchait, et les toques de velours, les manteaux, les épées, toutes ces imaginations qui s’agitaient dans l’harmonie comme dans l’atmosphère d’un autre monde. Mais une jeune femme s’avança en jetant une bourse à un écuyer vert. Elle resta seule, et alors on entendit une flûte qui faisait comme un murmure de fontaine ou comme des gazouillements d’oiseau. Lucie entama d’un air brave sa cavatine en sol majeur ; elle se plaignait d’amour, elle demandait des ailes. Emma, de même, aurait voulu, fuyant la vie, s’envoler dans une étreinte. Tout à coup, Edgar-Lagardy parut.","She found herself in the readings of her youth, in the middle of Walter Scott. He seemed to hear, through the fog, the sound of Scottish bagpipes repeating itself on the heather. Moreover, the memory of the novel facilitating the understanding of the libretto, she followed the plot sentence by sentence, while elusive thoughts that came back to her dispersed immediately under the gusts of music. She let herself go to the lullaby of the melodies and felt herself vibrate with all her being as if the bows of the violins had traveled over her nerves. She didn't have enough eyes to contemplate the costumes, the sets, the characters, the painted trees that trembled when you walked, and the velvet hats, the coats, the swords, all those imaginations that stirred in the harmony as in the atmosphere of another world. But a young woman came forward throwing a purse to a green squire. She was left alone, and then a flute was heard which sounded like the murmur of a fountain or the chirping of a bird. Lucie bravely began her cavatina in G major; she complained of love, she asked for wings. Emma, likewise, would have liked, fleeing life, to fly away in an embrace. Suddenly Edgar-Lagardy appeared.","She was back in the books she had read in her youth—deep in Sir Walter Scott.

Her recollection of the novel also made it easier for her to understand the libretto; she could follow the plot phrase by phrase, while the elusive thoughts that kept returning to her were dissipated immediately by the gusts of music. She gave herself up to the lulling melodies and felt her whole being vibrate as if the bows of the violins were running over her very nerves. She did not have eyes enough to take in the costumes, the sets, the characters, the painted trees that quivered at every footstep, and the velvet caps, the cloaks, the swords, all these fantasies rustling within the music as though in the atmosphere of another world.

"On était aux premiers jours d’octobre. Il y avait du brouillard sur la campagne. Des vapeurs s’allongeaient à l’horizon, entre le contour des collines ; et d’autres, se déchirant, montaient, se perdaient. Quelquefois, dans un écartement des nuées, sous un rayon de soleil, on apercevait au loin les toits d’Yonville, avec les jardins au bord de l’eau, les cours, les murs, et le clocher de l’église. Emma fermait à demi les paupières pour reconnaître sa maison, et jamais ce pauvre village où elle vivait ne lui avait semblé si petit. De la hauteur où ils étaient, toute la vallée paraissait un immense lac pâle, s’évaporant à l’air. Les massifs d’arbres, de place en place, saillissaient comme des rochers noirs ; et les hautes lignes des peupliers, qui dépassaient la brume, figuraient des grèves que le vent remuait.","We were in the first days of October. There was fog over the countryside. Vapors stretched out on the horizon, between the outline of the hills; and others, tearing themselves apart, mounted, were lost. Sometimes, in the parting of the clouds, under a ray of sunshine, one could see in the distance the roofs of Yonville, with the gardens at the edge of the water, the courtyards, the walls, and the steeple of the church. Emma half-closed her eyelids to recognize her house, and this poor village where she lived had never seemed so small to her. From the height where they were, the whole valley seemed an immense pale lake, evaporating in the air. The clumps of trees, here and there, jutted out like black rocks; and the high rows of poplars, which rose above the mist, represented shores stirred by the wind.","It was the beginning of October. There was a haze over the countryside. Mist lay along the horizon, between the outlines of the hills; and elsewhere it tore apart, rose, vanished. Sometimes, through a gap in the haze, one could see the roofs of Yonville under a ray of sunlight in the distance, with its gardens by the water’s edge, its courtyards, walls, and church steeple. Emma would half close her eyes so as to distinguish her own house, and never had this poor village where she lived seemed so small to her. From the height on which they were standing, the whole valley appeared to be one vast, pale lake, evaporating into the air. Clumps of trees jutted up at intervals like black rocks; and the tall lines of poplars, rising above the fog, were like its shores, stirred by the wind.","It was early October. There was a mist over the countryside. Wisps of vapor lay along the horizon, following the contours of the hills, and elsewhere they were drifting and rising and evaporating. Now and then as the clouds shifted, a ray of sun would light up the roofs of Yonville in the distance, with its riverside gardens, its yards and its church steeple. Emma half closed her eyes trying to pick out her house, and never had the wretched village she lived in looked so very small. From the height on which they were standing the whole valley was like an immense pale lake, dissolving into thin air: clumps of trees stood out here and there like dark rocks, and the tall lines of poplars piercing the fog were like its leafy banks, swaying in the wind."
On crut qu’elle avait le délire ; elle l’eut à partir de minuit : une fièvre cérébrale s’était déclarée.,It was believed that she was delirious; she had it from midnight: a cerebral fever had broken out.,"They thought she was delirious; and she was, from midnight on: a brain fever had set in.","They thought her delirious, and from midnight on she was: there could be no doubt that it was brain fever."
"– L’attendre ? Et M. Binet donc ! À six heures battant vous allez le voir entrer, car son pareil n’existe pas sur la terre pour l’exactitude. Il lui faut toujours sa place dans la petite salle ! On le tuerait plutôt que de le faire dîner ailleurs ! et dégoûté qu’il est ! et si difficile pour le cidre ! Ce n’est pas comme M. Léon ; lui, il arrive quelquefois à sept heures, sept heures et demie même ; il ne regarde seulement pas à ce qu’il mange.

He’s not like Monsieur Léon; now, that one comes in sometimes at seven o’clock, seven-thirty; he doesn’t even look at what he’s eating. What a good young man! Never one word louder than the last.”","“Wait? And what about Monsieur Binet? You’ll see him come in on the stroke of six: he’s the most punctual man in the world.

Monsieur Léon sometimes doesn’t come in till seven, or even half-past, and half the time he doesn’t even know what he’s eating. What a nice young man! So polite! So soft-spoken!”"
"L’air du bal était lourd ; les lampes pâlissaient. On refluait dans la salle de billard. Un domestique monta sur une chaise et cassa deux vitres ; au bruit des éclats de verre, madame Bovary tourna la tête et aperçut dans le jardin, contre les carreaux, des faces de paysans qui regardaient. Alors le souvenir des Bertaux lui arriva. Elle revit la ferme, la mare bourbeuse, son père en blouse sous les pommiers, et elle se revit elle-même, comme autrefois, écrémant avec son doigt les terrines de lait dans la laiterie. Mais, aux fulgurations de l’heure présente, sa vie passée, si nette jusqu’alors, s’évanouissait tout entière, et elle doutait presque de l’avoir vécue. Elle était là ; puis autour du bal, il n’y avait plus que de l’ombre, étalée sur tout le reste. Elle mangeait alors une glace au marasquin, qu’elle tenait de la main gauche dans une coquille de vermeil, et fermait à demi les yeux, la cuiller entre les dents.","The air of the ball was heavy; the lamps were dim. We flowed back into the billiard room. A servant climbed onto a chair and broke two panes; at the sound of the shards of glass, Madame Bovary turned her head and saw in the garden, against the windowpanes, the faces of peasants watching. Then the memory of the Bertaux came to him. She saw the farm again, the muddy pond, her father in a smock under the apple trees, and she saw herself again, as before, skimming the milk terrines in the dairy with her finger. But, in the fulgurations of the present hour, her past life, so clear until then, vanished entirely, and she almost doubted that she had lived it. She was there ; then around the ball there was only shadow, spread over everything else. She would then eat a maraschino ice cream, which she held in her left hand in a vermeil shell, and half closed her eyes, the spoon between her teeth.","The air in the ballroom was heavy; the lamps were growing dim. People were drifting back into the billiards room. A servant climbing up onto a chair broke two windowpanes; at the noise of the shattered glass, Madame Bovary turned her head and noticed in the garden, against the window, the faces of countrypeople looking in. Then the memory of Les Bertaux returned to her. She saw the farm again, the muddy pond, her father in a smock under the apple trees, and she saw herself as she used to be, skimming cream with her finger from the pans of milk in the milk house. But under the dazzling splendors of the present hour, her past life, so distinct until now, was vanishing altogether, and she almost doubted that she had ever lived it. She was here; and then, surrounding the ball, there was nothing left but darkness, spread out over all the rest. She was at that moment eating a maraschino ice, holding it with her left hand in a silver-gilt shell and 			half closing her eyes, the spoon between her teeth.","The air in the ballroom had grown heavy; the lamps were beginning to dim; a number of the men disappeared in the direction of the billiard room.

But amid the splendors of this night her past life, hitherto so vividly present, was vanishing utterly; indeed she was beginning almost to doubt that she had lived it. She was here: and around the brilliant ball was a shadow that veiled all else. She was eating a maraschino ice, at that precise moment, from a gilded silver scallop-shell that she was holding in her left hand; the spoon was between her teeth, her eyes were half shut."

"Alors, sans aucun égard pour Hippolyte, qui suait d’angoisse entre ses draps, ces messieurs engagèrent une conversation où l’apothicaire compara le sang-froid d’un chirurgien à celui d’un général ; et ce rapprochement fut agréable à Canivet, qui se répandit en paroles sur les exigences de son art. Il le considérait comme un sacerdoce, bien que les officiers de santé le déshonorassent. Enfin, revenant au malade, il examina les bandes apportées par Homais, les mêmes qui avaient comparu lors du pied-bot, et demanda quelqu’un pour lui tenir le membre. On envoya chercher Lestiboudois, et M. Canivet, ayant retroussé ses manches, passa dans la salle de billard, tandis que l’apothicaire restait avec Artémise et l’aubergiste, plus pâles toutes les deux que leur tablier, et l’oreille tendue contre la porte.","Then, without any regard for Hippolyte, who was sweating with anguish between his sheets, these gentlemen engaged in a conversation in which the apothecary compared the coolness of a surgeon to that of a general; and this rapprochement was agreeable to Canivet, who poured out words about the demands of his art.

Finally, returning to the patient, he examined the bandages brought by Homais, the same which had appeared during the clubfoot, and asked for someone to hold the limb for him. They sent for Lestiboudois, and M. Canivet, having rolled up his sleeves, went into the billiard room, while the apothecary remained with Artémise and the innkeeper, both paler than their aprons, and their ears straining against the the door.","Then, without any regard for Hippolyte, who was sweating with anguish under his bedclothes, the two gentlemen embarked on a conversation in which the apothecary compared the coolness of a surgeon to that of a general; and this comparison was agreeable to Canivet, who launched into some remarks on the demands of his art.

He looked on it as a kind of sacred charge, even though dishonored nowadays by the activities of the officiers de santé. Then, finally giving thought to his patient, he inspected the bandages Homais had brought—the same ones he had furnished the day of the earlier operation—and asked for someone to hold the leg for him while he worked.

"Les dames de la société se tenaient derrière, sous le vestibule, entre les colonnes, tandis que le commun de la foule était en face, debout, ou bien assis sur des chaises. En effet, Lestiboudois avait apporté là toutes celles qu’il avait déménagées de la prairie, et même il courait à chaque minute en chercher d’autres dans l’église, et causait un tel encombrement par son commerce, que l’on avait grand-peine à parvenir jusqu’au petit escalier de l’estrade.","The ladies of the society stood behind, under the vestibule, between the columns, while the common people of the crowd were in front, standing or seated on chairs.

"– Et non seulement, continua l’apothicaire, les humains sont en butte à ces anomalies, mais encore les animaux. Ainsi, vous n’êtes pas sans savoir l’effet singulièrement aphrodisiaque que produit le nepeta cataria, vulgairement appelé herbe-au-chat, sur la gent féline ; et d’autre part, pour citer un exemple que je garantis authentique, Bridoux (un de mes anciens camarades, actuellement établi rue Malpalu) possède un chien qui tombe en convulsions dès qu’on lui présente une tabatière. Souvent même il en fait l’expérience devant ses amis, à son pavillon du bois Guillaume. Croirait-on qu’un simple sternutatoire pût exercer de tels ravages dans l’organisme d’un quadrupède ? C’est extrêmement curieux, n’est-il pas vrai ?","“And not only,” continued the apothecary, “humans are the butt of these anomalies, but also animals. Thus, you are not unaware of the singularly aphrodisiac effect produced by nepeta cataria, commonly called catnip, on feline people; and on the other hand, to cite an example that I guarantee to be authentic, Bridoux (one of my former comrades, currently living in rue Malpalu) has a dog who goes into convulsions as soon as you present him with a snuffbox. Often he even experiences it in front of his friends, at his pavilion in the Bois Guillaume. Would you believe that a simple sneeze could wreak such havoc on the organism of a quadruped? It's extremely curious, isn't it?","“And,” continued the apothecary, “it’s not only humans who are vulnerable to these anomalies, but animals, too. For instance, you’re surely aware of the singular aphrodisiac effect produced by Nepeta cataria, vulgarly known as catnip, on the feline tribe; and again, to mention an example I guarantee to be authentic, Bridoux (one of my old schoolmates, presently established in the rue Malpalu) has a dog that falls into convulsions if one offers it a snuffbox. He frequently performs the experiment in front of his friends, at his summerhouse in Bois-Guillaume. Who would ever think that a simple sternutative could work such havoc in a quadruped’s organism? It’s extremely curious, don’t you find?”","“And it’s not only humans who are subject to such anomalies,” continued the apothecary. “Animals are, too. You are certainly not ignorant of the intensely aphrodisiac effect produced by nepeta cataria, vulgarly called catnip, on the feline species; and to mention another example—one whose authenticity I myself can vouch for—Bridoux, one of my old schoolmates, now in business in the Rue Malpalu, has a dog which has convulsions if you show it a snuffbox. Bridoux sometimes makes him perform for his friends, at his suburban residence in Bois-Guillaume. Would you believe that a simple sternutative could work such havoc in the organism of a quadruped? It’s extremely curious, don’t you find?”"

"C’était le jeudi. Elle se levait, et elle s’habillait silencieusement pour ne point éveiller Charles qui lui aurait fait des observations sur ce qu’elle s’apprêtait de trop bonne heure.

"À ce tintement répété, la pensée de la jeune femme s’égarait dans ses vieux souvenirs de jeunesse et de pension. Elle se rappela les grands chandeliers, qui dépassaient sur l’autel les vases pleins de fleurs et le tabernacle à colonnettes. Elle aurait voulu, comme autrefois, être encore confondue dans la longue ligne des voiles blancs, que marquaient de noir ça et là les capuchons raides des bonnes sœurs inclinées sur leur prie-Dieu ; le dimanche, à la messe, quand elle relevait sa tête, elle apercevait le doux visage de la Vierge parmi les tourbillons bleuâtres de l’encens qui montait. Alors un attendrissement la saisit ; elle se sentit molle et tout abandonnée, comme un duvet d’oiseau qui tournoie dans la tempête ; et ce fut sans en avoir conscience qu’elle s’achemina vers l’église, disposée à n’importe quelle dévotion, pourvu qu’elle y absorbât son âme et que l’existence entière y disparût.","At this repeated ringing, the thought of the young woman was lost in her old memories of youth and boarding school. She remembered the great candlesticks which rose above the vases full of flowers and the tabernacle with small columns on the altar. She would have liked, as before, to still be confused in the long line of white veils, marked here and there with black by the stiff hoods of the nuns bent over their kneelers; on Sundays, at mass, when she raised her head, she saw the gentle face of the Virgin among the bluish swirls of rising incense. Then a feeling of tenderness seized her; she felt limp and completely abandoned, like a bird's down swirling in a storm; and it was without realizing it that she went to the church, disposed to any devotion, provided that she absorbed her soul there and that all existence disappeared there.","With this steady chiming, the young woman’s thoughts strayed among old memories of her youth and boarding school. She recalled the great candelabras, which rose, on the altar, higher than the flower-filled vases and the tabernacle with its little columns. She wished that once again, as in the old days, she could be part of the long line of white veils marked here and there with black by the stiff cowls of the good sisters bending over their prie-dieux; on Sundays, at Mass, when she lifted her head, she would see the sweet face of the Virgin among the bluish eddies of rising incense. And now she was filled with tenderness; she felt soft and utterly abandoned, like the downy feather of a bird turning in a storm; and it was without conscious awareness that she made her way toward the church, inclined to any devotion, so long as her soul might be absorbed in it and all of life disappear into it.","As the ringing continued, the young woman’s thoughts began to stray among old memories of girlhood and the convent. She remembered the tall altar candlesticks that soared above the vases full of flowers and the columned tabernacle. She wished she could be again what she once had been, one in the long line of white-veiled girls, black-specked here and there by the stiff cowls of the nuns bowed over their prie-dieus. Sundays at Mass when she raised her head she used to see the gentle features of the Virgin among the bluish clouds of rising incense. The memory filled her with emotion: she felt limp and passive, like a bit of bird’s-down whirling in a storm; and automatically she turned her steps toward the church, ready for any devotion that would enable her to humble her heart and lose herself entirely."
"Mais, dès qu’elle fut partie, Emma ne tarda pas à émerveiller Bovary par son bon sens pratique.

"Ils reconnurent la maison à un vieux noyer qui l’ombrageait. Basse et couverte de tuiles brunes, elle avait en dehors, sous la lucarne de son grenier, un chapelet d’oignons suspendu. Des bourrées, debout contre la clôture d’épines, entouraient un carré de laitues, quelques pieds de lavande et des pots à fleurs montés sur des rames. De l’eau sale coulait en s’éparpillant sur l’herbe, et il y avait tout autour plusieurs guenilles indistinctes, des bas de tricot, une camisole d’indienne rouge, et un grand drap de toile épaisse étalé en long sur la haie. Au bruit de la barrière, la nourrice parut, tenant sur son bras un enfant qui tétait. Elle tirait de l’autre main un pauvre marmot chétif, couvert de scrofules au visage, le fils d’un bonnetier de Rouen, que ses parents trop occupés de leur négoce laissaient à la campagne.","They recognized the house by an old walnut tree which shaded it. Low and covered with brown tiles, it had outside, under the dormer window of its attic, a string of onions suspended.

Dirty water was flowing and scattering on the grass, and all around were several indistinct rags, knitted stockings, a red calico camisole, and a large thick linen sheet spread lengthwise on the hedge. . At the sound of the gate, the nurse appeared, holding a nursing child on her arm. With her other hand she was pulling a poor puny brat, his face covered with scrofula, the son of a Rouen hosier, whom his parents, too busy with their business, had left in the country.","They recognized the house by an old walnut tree that shaded it.

"L’hiver fut rude. La convalescence de Madame fut longue. Quand il faisait beau, on la poussait dans son fauteuil auprès de la fenêtre, celle qui regardait la Place ; car elle avait maintenant le jardin en antipathie, et la persienne de ce côté restait constamment fermée. Elle voulut que l’on vendît le cheval ; ce qu’elle aimait autrefois, à présent lui déplaisait. Toutes ses idées paraissaient se borner au soin d’elle-même. Elle restait dans son lit à faire de petites collations, sonnait sa domestique pour s’informer de ses tisanes ou pour causer avec elle. Cependant la neige sur le toit des halles jetait dans la chambre un reflet blanc, immobile ; ensuite ce fut la pluie qui tombait.

Madame's convalescence was long. When the weather was fine, they pushed her into her armchair near the window, the one looking out over the square; for she now had an antipathy to the garden, and the shutter on that side remained constantly closed. She wanted the horse sold; what she once liked now displeased her. All her ideas seemed to be confined to the care of herself. She stayed in her bed making small snacks, ringing her maid to inquire about her herbal teas or to chat with her. However, the snow on the roof of the markets threw a white, motionless reflection into the room; then it was the rain that fell. And Emma waited daily, with a kind of anxiety, for the infallible return of trivial events, which nevertheless mattered little to her. The most significant was, in the evening, the arrival of the Hirondelle. Then the innkeeper shouted and other voices answered, while Hippolyte's lantern, which was looking for chests on the tarpaulin, made like a star in the darkness. At noon Charles returned; then he went out; then she would take a broth, and around five o'clock, at nightfall, the children who were returning from class, dragging their clogs on the sidewalk, all beat with their rulers the rattle of the awnings, one after the other. others.","The winter was harsh.

"La fracture était simple, sans complication d’aucune espèce. Charles n’eût osé en souhaiter de plus facile. Alors, se rappelant les allures de ses maîtres auprès du lit des blessés, il réconforta le patient avec toutes sortes de bons mots ; caresses chirurgicales qui sont comme l’huile dont on graisse les bistouris. Afin d’avoir des attelles, on alla chercher, sous la charreterie, un paquet de lattes. Charles en choisit une, la coupa en morceaux et la polit avec un éclat de vitre, tandis que la servante déchirait des draps pour faire des bandes, et que mademoiselle Emma tâchait à coudre des coussinets. Comme elle fut longtemps avant de trouver son étui, son père s’impatienta ; elle ne répondit rien ; mais, tout en cousant, elle se piquait les doigts, qu’elle portait ensuite à sa bouche pour les sucer.","The fracture was simple, with no complications of any kind.

Charles chose one, cut it into pieces, and polished it with a shard of glass, while the servant tore sheets to make strips, and Mademoiselle Emma tried to sew pillows. As it was a long time before she found her case, her father grew impatient; she answered nothing; but, while sewing, she pricked her fingers, which she then put to her mouth to suck them.","The fracture was simple, without complications of any kind.

Charles chose one, cut it into pieces, and polished it with a shard of window glass, while the maidservant tore up some sheets to make bandages, and Mademoiselle Emma worked at sewing some pads. She was a long time finding her needle case, and her father grew impatient; she said nothing in response; but, as she sewed, she kept pricking her fingers, which she then raised to her mouth to suck.","The fracture was a simple one, without complications of any kind. Charles couldn’t have wished for anything easier. Then he recalled his teachers’ bedside manner in accident cases, and proceeded to cheer up his patient with all kinds of facetious remarks—a truly surgical attention, like the oiling of a scalpel. For splints, they sent someone to bring a bundle of laths from the carriage shed. Charles selected one, cut it into lengths and smoothed it down with a piece of broken window glass, while the maidservant tore sheets for bandages and Mademoiselle Emma tried to sew some pads.

"Ce dîner de la veille était pour lui un événement considérable ; jamais, jusqu’alors, il n’avait causé pendant deux heures de suite avec une dame. Comment donc avoir pu lui exposer, et en un tel langage, quantité de choses qu’il n’aurait pas si bien dites auparavant ? il était timide d’habitude et gardait cette réserve qui participe à la fois de la pudeur et de la dissimulation. On trouvait à Yonville qu’il avait des manières comme il faut. Il écoutait raisonner les gens mûrs, et ne paraissait point exalté en politique, chose remarquable pour un jeune homme. Puis il possédait des talents, il peignait à l’aquarelle, savait lire la clef de sol, et s’occupait volontiers de littérature après son dîner, quand il ne jouait pas aux cartes. M Homais le considérait pour son instruction ; madame Homais l’affectionnait pour sa complaisance, car souvent il accompagnait au jardin les petits Homais, marmots toujours barbouillés, fort mal élevés et quelque peu lymphatiques, comme leur mère. Ils avaient pour les soigner, outre la bonne, Justin, l’élève en pharmacie, un arrière-cousin de M. Homais que l’on avait pris dans la maison par charité, et qui servait en même temps de domestique.","This dinner the night before was a considerable event for him; never before had he talked for two hours straight with a lady. How then could he have explained to him, and in such language, a number of things that he would not have said so well before? he was usually shy and kept this reserve which is part of both modesty and dissimulation. It was thought at Yonville that he had decent manners. He listened to the reasoning of mature people, and did not seem politically exalted, a remarkable thing for a young man. Then he had talents, he painted in watercolor, knew how to read the treble clef, and willingly busied himself with literature after his dinner, when he was not playing cards. Madame Homais considered him for his education; Madame Homais was fond of him for his kindness, for he often accompanied the little Homais to the garden, brats always smeared, very badly brought up and somewhat lymphatic, like their mother. They had to look after them, besides the maid, Justin, the student in pharmacy, a second cousin of M. Homais who had been taken into the house out of charity, and who served at the same time as a servant.","The dinner the previous evening had been a notable event for him; never before had he talked for two hours in succession with a lady. How, then, had he been able to tell her, and in such language, so many things that he would not have been able to express so well before? He was usually shy and maintained the sort of reserve that partakes at once of modesty and dissimulation. People in Yonville felt that his manners were very correct. He would listen to the arguments of his elders and did not seem at all hotheaded in politics, a remarkable thing in a young man. And he possessed talents, he painted with watercolors, knew how to read the treble clef, and was quite likely to occupy himself with literature after dinner, when he was not playing cards. Monsieur Homais esteemed him for his learning; Madame Homais was fond of him because of his amiability, for he would often go out into the garden with the Homais 			children, dirty little urchins, very badly brought up and somewhat lymphatic, like their mother. To look after them, they had, besides the maid, the pharmacy student Justin, a distant cousin of Monsieur Homais’s who had been taken into the house out of charity, and who also acted as servant.","The dinner of the previous evening had been a notable event for him: never before had he spoken for two consecutive hours with a “lady.” How did it happen that he had been able to tell her so many things, in words that previously he wouldn’t have thought of? He was ordinarily timid, with a reticence that was part modesty, part dissimulation. In Yonville he was thought to have very gentlemanly manners. He listened respectfully to his elders, and seemed not to get excited about politics—a remarkable trait in a young man. Besides, he was talented. He painted in water colors, could read the key of G, and when he didn’t play cards after dinner he often took up a book. Monsieur Homais esteemed him because he was educated; Madame Homais liked him because he was helpful: he often spent some time with her children in the garden. They were brats, the Homais children, always dirty, wretchedly brought up, sluggish like their mother. Besides the maid, they were looked after by the pharmacist’s apprentice, Justin, a distant cousin of Monsieur Homais, who had been taken in out of charity and was exploited as a servant."
"Madame Homais aimait beaucoup ces petits pains lourds, en forme de turban, que l’on mange dans le carême avec du beurre salé : dernier échantillon des nourritures gothiques, qui remonte peut-être au siècle des croisades, et dont les robustes Normands s’emplissaient autrefois, croyant voir sur la table, à la lueur des torches jaunes, entre les brocs d’hypocras et les gigantesques charcuteries, des têtes de Sarrasins à dévorer. La femme de l’apothicaire les croquait comme eux, héroïquement, malgré sa détestable dentition ; aussi, toutes les fois que M. Homais faisait un voyage à la ville, il ne manquait pas de lui en rapporter, qu’il prenait toujours chez le grand faiseur, rue Massacre.","Madame Homais was very fond of these heavy rolls, in the shape of a turban, which are eaten in Lent with salted butter: the last sample of Gothic foods, which perhaps dates back to the century of the Crusades, and which the robust Normans relied on formerly filled, believing they saw on the table, by the light of the yellow torches, between the jugs of hypocras and the gigantic meats, heads of Saracens to devour. The apothecary's wife munched them like them, heroically, in spite of her detestable teeth; also, whenever M. Homais made a trip to town, he did not fail to bring him back some, which he always took from the great maker in the Rue Massacre.","Madame Homais was very fond of these heavy little turban-shaped loaves that are eaten with salted butter during Lent: a last relic of Gothic food, dating back perhaps to the century of the Crusades, and one with which the robust Normans used to stuff themselves, believing that before them on the table, in the light of their yellow torches, between the jugs of hippocras and the giant slabs of pork, lay the heads of Saracens waiting to be devoured. The apothecary’s wife would chomp them heroically, like the Normans, despite her deplorable set of teeth; and so, each time Monsieur Homais went to town, he did not fail to bring some back to her, buying them always from the great baker in the rue Massacre.","Madame Homais was particularly fond of those heavy turban-shaped rolls, which the Rouennais eat in Lent with salted butter—a last relic of Gothic fare, going back perhaps to the times of the Crusades. The lusty Normans of those days gorged themselves on cheminots, picturing them as the heads of Saracens, to be devoured by the light of yellow torches along with flacons of spiced wine and giant slabs of meat. Like those ancients, the apothecary’s wife crunched them heroically, despite her wretched teeth; and every time Monsieur Homais made a trip to the city he faithfully brought some back to her, buying them always at the best baker ’s, in the Rue Massacre."

"Mais, à partir de ce moment, elle n’écouta plus ; et le chœur des conviés, la scène d’Ashton et de son valet, le grand duo en ré majeur, tout passa pour elle dans l’éloignement, comme si les instruments fussent devenus moins sonores et les personnages plus reculés ; elle se rappelait les parties de cartes chez le pharmacien, et la promenade chez la nourrice, les lectures sous la tonnelle, les tête-à-tête au coin du feu, tout ce pauvre amour si calme et si long, si discret, si tendre, et qu’elle avait oublié cependant.

"Tous ces gens-là se ressemblaient. Leurs molles figures blondes, un peu hâlées par le soleil, avaient la couleur du cidre doux, et leurs favoris bouffants s’échappaient de grands cols roides, que maintenaient des cravates blanches à rosette bien étalée.

"Un jour qu’en prévision de son départ elle faisait des rangements dans un tiroir, elle se piqua les doigts à quelque chose. C’était un fil de fer de son bouquet de mariage. Les boutons d’oranger étaient jaunes de poussière, et les rubans de satin, à liséré d’argent, s’effiloquaient par le bord. Elle le jeta dans le feu. Il s’enflamma plus vite qu’une paille sèche. Puis ce fut comme un buisson rouge sur les cendres, et qui se rongeait lentement. Elle le regarda brûler. Les petites baies de carton éclataient, les fils d’archal se tordaient, le galon se fondait ; et les corolles de papier, racornies, se balançant le long de la plaque comme des papillons noirs, enfin s’envolèrent par la cheminée.","One day when, in anticipation of her departure, she was tidying up in a drawer, she pricked her fingers on something. It was a wire from her wedding bouquet. The orange buttons were yellow with dust, and the satin ribbons, edged with silver, frayed at the edge. She threw it into the fire. It ignited faster than a dry straw. Then it was like a red bush on the ashes, slowly gnawing away. She watched it burn. The little cardboard bays burst, the archal threads twisted, the braid melted; and the shriveled paper corollas, swaying along the plate like black butterflies, finally flew up the chimney.","One day while tidying a drawer in anticipation of her departure, she pricked her fingers on something.

"Mais, par ce renoncement, il la plaçait en des conditions extraordinaires. Elle se dégagea, pour lui, des qualités charnelles dont il n’avait rien à obtenir ; et elle alla, dans son cœur, montant toujours et s’en détachant, à la manière magnifique d’une apothéose qui s’envole. C’était un de ces sentiments purs qui n’embarrassent pas l’exercice de la vie, que l’on cultive parce qu’ils sont rares ; et dont la perte affligerait plus que la possession n’est réjouissante.","But, by this renunciation, he placed her in extraordinary conditions. She freed herself, for him, of the carnal qualities of which he had nothing to obtain; and it went, in his heart, always rising and detaching itself from it, in the magnificent manner of an apotheosis which flies away. It was one of those pure sentiments which do not interfere with the exercise of life, which one cultivates because they are rare; and the loss of which would grieve more than the possession of it rejoice.","But by renouncing her in this way, he was placing her in an extraordinary situation. She was divested, in his eyes, of the fleshly attributes from which he had nothing to hope for; and in his heart, she rose higher and higher, withdrawing further from him in a magnificent, soaring apotheosis. His was one of those pure sentiments that do not impede the pursuit of one’s life, that one cultivates because they are so rare, and the loss of which would afflict one more than their possession delights.","But by thus renouncing her, he transformed her into an extraordinary being. She was divested in his eyes of the earthly attributes that held no promise for him; and in his heart she rose higher and higher, withdrawing further from him in a magnificent, soaring apotheosis. His feeling for her was so pure that it did not interfere with his daily life—it was one of those feelings that are cherished because of their very rarity: the distress caused by their loss would be greater than the happiness given by their possession."
"– Pourtant, interrompit Charles qui mordait à petits coups son sorbet au rhum, on prétend qu’au dernier acte il est admirable tout à fait ; je regrette d’être parti avant la fin, car ça commençait à m’amuser.","“Yet,” interrupted Charles, biting into his rum sorbet, “it is said that in the last act he is quite admirable; I regret leaving before the end, because it was starting to amuse me.","“And yet,” interrupted Charles, who was taking little bites of his rum sorbet, “they say that in the last act he’s really wonderful ; I’m sorry we left before the end, because I was beginning to enjoy it.”","“Still,” interrupted Charles, who was eating his rum sherbet a tiny bit at a time, “they say he’s wonderful in the last act. I was sorry to leave before the end: I was beginning to like it.”"
"Emma, d’autre part ; savait conduire sa maison. Elle envoyait aux malades le compte des visites, dans des lettres bien tournées, qui ne sentaient pas la facture. Quand ils avaient, le dimanche, quelque voisin à dîner, elle trouvait moyen d’offrir un plat coquet, s’entendait à poser sur des feuilles de vigne les pyramides de reines-claudes, servait renversés les pots de confitures dans une assiette, et même elle parlait d’acheter des rince-bouche pour le dessert. Il rejaillissait de tout cela beaucoup de considération sur Bovary.","Emma, on the other hand; knew how to run his house. She sent the sick the account of the visits, in well-turned letters, which did not smell of the invoice. When they had a neighbor for dinner on Sundays, she found a way to offer a pretty dish, knew how to place the pyramids of greengages on vine leaves, served upside-down jars of jam on a plate, and even she was talking about buying mouthwash for dessert. Much consideration was reflected from all this on Bovary.","Moreover, Emma knew how to manage her household. She would send the patients the statements for their consultations in well-phrased letters that did not sound like invoices. When, on a Sunday, they had some neighbor to dinner, she would contrive to present a stylish dish, understood how to build a pyramid of greengages on some vine leaves, would serve little pots of preserves turned out on plates, and she even talked about buying mouth-rinsing bowls for the dessert course. All of this reflected a good deal of credit on Bovary.","Moreover, Emma knew how to run her house. She let Charles’s patients know how much they owed him, writing them nicely phrased letters that didn’t sound like bills. When a neighbor came to Sunday dinner she always managed to think up some attractive dish. She would arrange greengages in a pyramid on a bed of vine leaves; she served her jellies not in their jars but neatly turned out on a plate; she spoke of buying finger bowls for dessert. All this redounded greatly to Bovary’s credit."
"Il n’envoya point d’étoffe, il l’apporta. Puis il revint pour l’aunage ; il revint sous d’autres prétextes, tâchant chaque fois, de se rendre aimable, serviable, s’inféodant, comme eût dit Homais, et toujours glissant à Emma quelques conseils sur la procuration. Il ne parlait point du billet. Elle n’y songeait pas ; Charles, au début de sa convalescence, lui en avait bien conté quelque chose ; mais tant d’agitations avaient passé dans sa tête, qu’elle ne s’en souvenait plus. D’ailleurs, elle se garda d’ouvrir aucune discussion d’intérêt ; la mère Bovary en fut surprise, et attribua son changement d’humeur aux sentiments religieux qu’elle avait contractés étant malade.","He did not send any cloth, he brought it. Then he returned for the aunage; he returned under other pretexts, trying each time to make himself amiable, helpful, subservient, as Homais would have said, and always slipping Emma some advice on the power of attorney. He did not speak of the note. She did not think of it; Charles, at the beginning of his convalescence, had told him something about it; but so many agitations had passed through her head that she no longer remembered them. Besides, she took care not to open any discussion of interest; Mother Bovary was surprised, and attributed her change of mood to the religious feelings she had contracted while ill.","He did not send the material, he brought it. Then he came again to take the measurements; he came again on other pretexts, each time trying to make himself amiable, helpful, pledging his loyalty like a vassal, as Homais would have put it, and always slipping to Emma some words of advice about the power of attorney. He never mentioned the note. She did not think about it; Charles, at the beginning of her convalescence, had indeed told her something about it; but her mind had been so agitated that she no longer remembered. What was more, she refrained from broaching any discussion of money; Mère Bovary was surprised by this and attributed her change of disposition to the religious sentiments she had developed when she was ill.","He didn’t send the material: he brought it. Then he came again to do the measuring, and again and again on other pretexts, each time putting himself out to be agreeable and helpful—making himself her liegeman, as Homais might have put it—and always slipping in a few words of advice about the power of attorney. He didn’t mention the promissory note. It didn’t occur to her to think of it: early in her convalescence Charles had, in fact, said something to her about it, but her mind had been so agitated that she had forgotten. Moreover she was careful never to bring up anything about money matters. This surprised her mother-in-law, who attributed her new attitude to the religious sentiments she had acquired during her illness."

Ah! You scarcely knew that out there, so close and yet so far away, was a poor wretch …”","“No,” he continued. “I didn’t come, these past few weeks. I haven’t seen you. But everything close to you I’ve looked at and looked at.

"Pour se faire valoir, ou par une imitation naïve de cette mélancolie qui provoquait la sienne, le jeune homme déclara s’être ennuyé prodigieusement tout le temps de ses études. La procédure l’irritait, d’autres vocations l’attiraient, et sa mère ne cessait, dans chaque lettre, de le tourmenter. Car ils précisaient de plus en plus les motifs de leur douleur, chacun, à mesure qu’il parlait, s’exaltant un peu dans cette confidence progressive. Mais ils s’arrêtaient quelquefois devant l’exposition complète de leur idée, et cherchaient alors à imaginer une phrase qui pût la traduire cependant. Elle ne confessa point sa passion pour un autre ; il ne dit pas qu’il l’avait oubliée.","To show off, or by a naive imitation of this melancholy which provoked his own, the young man declared that he had been prodigiously bored all the time of his studies. The procedure irritated him, other vocations attracted him, and his mother never ceased, in each letter, tormenting him.

She did not confess her passion for another; he does not say that he had forgotten her.","To show himself to good advantage, or quite naturally imitating her melancholy, which was inspiring his own, the young man declared that he had been prodigiously bored throughout his studies. Legal procedure irritated him, other vocations attracted him, and his mother, in her letters, never stopped tormenting him.

But they would sometimes stop before the complete disclosure of a thought and would then try to imagine a phrase that could express it anyway. She did not confess her passion for another man; he did not say that he had forgotten her.","Either to impress her, or naturally taking on the color of her melancholy, the young man declared that he had found his studies prodigiously frustrating. The technicalities of law irritated him, he was tempted by other careers, and in her letters his mother never stopped pestering him. Indeed, as they talked on they both became more specific in their complaints, and less reserved in their confidences. Occasionally they shrank from giving full expression to their thought, and groped for phrases that would convey it obliquely. But she never disclosed having had another passion, and he said nothing about having forgotten her."

"Quand sa mère mourut, elle pleura beaucoup les premiers jours. Elle se fit faire un tableau funèbre avec les cheveux de la défunte, et, dans une lettre qu’elle envoyait aux Bertaux, toute pleine de réflexions tristes sur la vie, elle demandait qu’on l’ensevelît plus tard dans le même tombeau. Le bonhomme la crut malade et vint la voir. Emma fut intérieurement satisfaite de se sentir arrivée du premier coup à ce rare idéal des existences pâles, où ne parviennent jamais les cœurs médiocres. Elle se laissa donc glisser dans les méandres lamartiniens, écouta les harpes sur les lacs, tous les chants de cygnes mourants, toutes les chutes de feuilles, les vierges pures qui montent au ciel, et la voix de l’Éternel discourant dans les vallons. Elle s’en ennuya, n’en voulut point convenir, continua par habitude, ensuite par vanité, et fut enfin surprise de se sentir apaisée, et sans plus de tristesse au cœur que de rides sur son front.","When her mother died, she cried a lot the first few days. She had a funereal picture made with the hair of the deceased, and in a letter which she sent to the Bertaux, full of sad reflections on life, she asked that she be buried later in the same tomb. The good man thought she was ill and came to see her. Emma was inwardly satisfied to feel that she had arrived at the first attempt at that rare ideal of pale existences, to which mediocre hearts never reach. She therefore let herself slip into the Lamartine meanders, listened to the harps on the lakes, all the songs of dying swans, all the falling leaves, the pure virgins who ascend to heaven, and the voice of the Eternal discoursing in the valleys. She was bored by it, would not admit it, continued out of habit, then out of vanity, and was finally surprised to feel appeased, and without more sadness in her heart than wrinkles on her forehead.","When her mother died, she wept a great deal in the first few days.

The good man thought she was ill and came to see her. Emma was inwardly satisfied to feel that she had, at her first attempt, reached that rare ideal of pallid lives, which mediocre hearts will never attain. And so she allowed herself to slip into Lamartinean meanderings, listened to harps on lakes, to the song of every dying swan, to the falling of every leaf, to pure virgins rising to heaven, and to the voice of the Eternal speaking in the valleys. She became bored with this, did not want to admit it, continued out of habit, then out of vanity, and was at last surprised to find that she was at peace, and that there was no more sadness in her heart than there were wrinkles 			on her forehead.","When her mother died, she wept profusely for several days.

Her father thought she must be ill, and went to see her. Emma was privately pleased to feel that she had so very quickly attained this ideal of ethereal languor, inaccessible to mediocre spirits. So she let herself meander along Lamartinian paths, listening to the throbbing of harps on lakes, to all the songs of dying swans, to the falling of every leaf, to the flight of pure virgins ascending to heaven, and to the voice of the Eternal speaking in the valleys. Gradually these things began to bore her, but she refused to admit it and continued as before, first out of habit, then out of vanity; until one day she discovered with surprise that the whole mood had evaporated, leaving her heart as free of melancholy as her brow was free of wrinkles."

"La soirée fut charmante, pleine de causeries, de rêves en commun. Ils parlèrent de leur fortune future, d’améliorations à introduire dans leur ménage, il voyait sa considération s’étendant, son bien-être s’augmentant, sa femme l’aimant toujours ; et elle se trouvait heureuse de se rafraîchir dans un sentiment nouveau, plus sain, meilleur, enfin d’éprouver quelque tendresse pour ce pauvre garçon qui la chérissait.

"Selon la mode de la campagne, elle lui proposa de boire quelque chose. Il refusa, elle insista, et enfin lui offrit, en riant, de prendre un verre de liqueur avec elle. Elle alla donc chercher dans l’armoire une bouteille de curaçao, atteignit deux petits verres, emplit l’un jusqu’au bord, versa à peine dans l’autre, et, après avoir trinqué, le porta à sa bouche.

"Le lendemain fut, pour Emma, une journée funèbre. Tout lui parut enveloppé par une atmosphère noire qui flottait confusément sur l’extérieur des choses, et le chagrin s’engouffrait dans son âme avec des hurlements doux, comme fait le vent d’hiver dans les châteaux abandonnés.

Everything appeared to her as though shrouded in vague, hovering blackness; and grief swirled into her soul, moaning softly like the winter wind in a deserted castle.

"D’abord, il ne savait comment faire pour dédommager M. Homais de tous les médicaments pris chez lui ; et, quoiqu’il eût pu, comme médecin, ne pas les payer, néanmoins il rougissait un peu de cette obligation. Puis la dépense du ménage, à présent que la cuisinière était maîtresse, devenait effrayante ; les notes pleuvaient dans la maison ; les fournisseurs murmuraient ; M. Lheureux, surtout, le harcelait. En effet, au plus fort de la maladie d’Emma, celui-ci, profitant de la circonstance pour exagérer sa facture, avait vite apporté le manteau, le sac de nuit, deux caisses au lieu d’une, quantité d’autres choses encore. Charles eut beau dire qu’il n’en avait pas besoin, le marchand répondit arrogamment qu’on lui avait commandé tous ces articles et qu’il ne les reprendrait pas ; d’ailleurs, ce serait contrarier Madame dans sa convalescence ; Monsieur réfléchirait ; bref, il était résolu à le poursuivre en justice plutôt que d’abandonner ses droits et que d’emporter ses marchandises. Charles ordonna par la suite de les renvoyer à son magasin ; Félicité oublia ; il avait d’autres soucis ; on n’y pensa plus ; M. Lheureux revint à la charge, et, tour à tour menaçant et gémissant, manœuvra de telle façon, que Bovary finit par souscrire un billet à six mois d’échéance. Mais à peine eut-il signé ce billet, qu’une idée audacieuse lui surgit : c’était d’emprunter mille francs à M. Lheureux. Donc, il demanda, d’un air embarrassé, s’il n’y avait pas moyen de les avoir, ajoutant que ce serait pour un an et au taux que l’on voudrait. Lheureux courut à sa boutique, en rapporta les écus et dicta un autre billet, par lequel Bovary déclarait devoir payer à son ordre, le Ier septembre prochain, la somme de mille soixante et dix francs ; ce qui, avec les cent quatre-vingts déjà stipulés, faisait juste douze cent cinquante. Ainsi, prêtant à six pour cent, augmenté d’un quart de commission, et les fournitures lui rapportant un bon tiers pour le moins, cela devait, en douze mois, donner cent trente francs de bénéfice ; et il espérait que l’affaire ne s’arrêterait pas là, qu’on ne pourrait payer les billets, qu’on les renouvellerait, et que son pauvre argent, s’étant nourri chez le médecin comme dans une maison de santé, lui reviendrait, un jour, considérablement plus dodu, et gros à faire craquer le sac.","First, he did not know how to compensate M. Homais for all the medication taken at home; and, although as a physician he might not have paid them, nevertheless he blushed a little at this obligation. Then the expense of the household, now that the cook was mistress, became dreadful; the notes rained down in the house; the suppliers murmured; M. Lheureux, above all, harassed him. Indeed, at the height of Emma's illness, he, taking advantage of the circumstance to exaggerate his bill, had quickly brought the coat, the night bag, two cases instead of one, a number of other things. again. In vain Charles said he did not need them, the merchant arrogantly replied that he had been ordered all these articles and that he would not take them back; besides, it would thwart Madame in her convalescence; Monsieur would reflect; in short, he was determined to sue him rather than abandon his rights and take away his goods. Charles subsequently ordered them to be returned to his store; Felicite forgot; he had other worries; no one thought of it any more; M. Lheureux returned to the charge, and, by turns menacing and groaning, maneuvered in such a way that Bovary ended by taking out a six-month note. But scarcely had he signed this note than a daring idea occurred to him: it was to borrow a thousand francs from M. Lheureux. So he asked, with an embarrassed air, if there was no way to get them, adding that it would be for a year and at the rate that one wanted. Lheureux ran to his shop, brought back the crowns, and dictated another note, by which Bovary declared that he would have to pay to his order, on the 1st of September next, the sum of one thousand and seventy francs; which, with the one hundred and eighty already stipulated, made just twelve hundred and fifty. Thus, lending at six per cent, increased by a quarter of the commission, and supplies bringing him a good third at least, that should, in twelve months, give a profit of one hundred and thirty francs; and he hoped that the affair would not end there, that the tickets could not be paid for, that they would be renewed, and that his poor money, having fed at the doctor's as in a sanatorium, would come back, one day, considerably plumper, and big enough to crack the bag.","First of all, he did not know how he was going to compensate Monsieur Homais for all the medicaments that had come from his pharmacy; and although, as a doctor, he could have chosen not to pay, nevertheless he felt a little ashamed at incurring that obligation. Then the household expenses, now that the servant was in charge, were becoming frightening; the notes were raining down on the house; the tradespeople were complaining; Monsieur Lheureux, above all, was harassing him. Indeed, at the height of Emma’s illness, Lheureux, profiting from the circumstances to pad his bill, had promptly brought over the coat, the overnight bag, two trunks instead of one, an abundance of other things as well. It was in vain that Charles said he did not need them; the merchant answered arrogantly that all these articles had been ordered from him and that he would not take them back; besides, it would be upsetting to Madame during her convalescence; Monsieur 			should think it over; in short, he was resolved to pursue him in a court of law rather than give up his rights and take back his merchandise. Charles afterward ordered everything to be sent back to the shop; Félicité forgot ; he had other worries; it was not thought of again; Monsieur Lheureux returned to the attack and, by turns threatening and complaining, maneuvered in such a way that in the end Bovary signed a note payable in six months. But scarcely had he signed this note, than a bold idea struck him: to borrow 1,000 francs from Monsieur Lheureux. And so he asked, with a look of embarrassment, if there was not some means of obtaining this amount, adding that it would be for one year and at any rate of interest he liked. Lheureux hurried to his shop, brought back the ecus, and dictated another note, whereby Bovary undertook to pay to his order, on September 1 next, the sum of 1,070 francs; which, with the 180 already stipulated, came to exactly 1,250. Thus, 			lending at 6 percent, augmented by a quarter’s commission and a profit of a good third at least on the goods, the whole thing should, in twelve months, yield a profit of 130 francs; and he hoped the matter would not end there, that the notes would not be paid, that they would be renewed, and that his meager capital, having been well nourished in the doctor’s home as though in a private sanatorium, would return to him, one day, considerably plumper, large enough to split open the bag.","To begin with, he didn’t know how to make good to Monsieur Homais for all the medicaments that had come from the pharmacy: as a doctor he might have been excused from paying for them, but the obligation embarrassed him. Then, what with the cook acting as mistress, the household expenses were getting to be alarming; there was a deluge of bills; the tradespeople were grumbling; Monsieur Lheureux, especially, was harassing him. The dry-goods dealer, taking advantage of the circumstances to pad his bill, had chosen a moment at the very height of Emma’s illness to deliver the cloak, the overnight bag, two trunks instead of one, and a number of other things as well. Charles protested that he had no use for them, but the shopkeeper arrogantly retorted that all those items had been ordered and that he wouldn’t take them back. Besides, he said, it would be upsetting to Madame in her convalescence. Monsieur should think it over. In short, he was determined to stand on his rights and carry the matter to court rather than give in. A little later Charles ordered that everything be sent back to the shop; but Félicité forgot; and he had other things on his mind and didn’t think of them. Monsieur Lheureux brought the matter up again, and by alternating threats and moans got Charles to sign a six-months’ promissory note. No sooner had he signed than he had a bold idea: he would try to borrow a thousand francs from Monseiur Lheureux. So he awkwardly asked whether there was any chance of this, explaining that it would be for one year and at any rate of interest Lheureux might specify. Lheureux ran to his shop, brought back the money, and dictated another promissory note, whereby Bovary promised to pay to his order, the first of the following September, the sum of 1,070 francs. Together with the 180 already stipulated, that came to just 1,250. In this way, loaning at the rate of six percent, plus his commission and at least one-third mark-up on the goods, the whole thing would bring him in a clear 130 francs’ profit in twelve months; and he hoped that it wouldn’t stop there, that the notes wouldn’t be met but renewed, and that his poor little capital, after benefiting from the doctor’s care like a patient in a sanatorium, would eventually come back to him considerably plumper, fat enough to burst the bag."

"Il était donc heureux et sans souci de rien au monde. Un repas en tête-à-tête, une promenade le soir sur la grande route, un geste de sa main sur ses bandeaux, la vue de son chapeau de paille accroché à l’espagnolette d’une fenêtre, et bien d’autres choses encore où Charles n’avait jamais soupçonné de plaisir, composaient maintenant la continuité de son bonheur. Au lit, le matin, et côte à côté sur l’oreiller, il regardait la lumière du soleil passer parmi le duvet de ses joues blondes, que couvraient à demi les pattes escalopées de son bonnet. Vus de si près, ses yeux lui paraissaient agrandis, surtout quand elle ouvrait plusieurs fois de suite ses paupières en s’éveillant ; noirs à l’ombre et bleu foncé au grand jour, ils avaient comme des couches de couleurs successives, et qui plus épaisses dans le fond, allaient en s’éclaircissant vers la surface de l’émail. Son œil, à lui, se perdait dans ces profondeurs, et il s’y voyait en petit jusqu’aux épaules, avec le foulard qui le coiffait et le haut de sa chemise entrouvert. Il se levait. Elle se mettait à la fenêtre pour le voir partir ; et elle restait accoudée sur le bord, entre deux pots de géraniums, vêtue de son peignoir, qui était lâche autour d’elle. Charles, dans la rue, bouclait ses éperons sur la borne ; et elle continuait à lui parler d’en haut, tout en arrachant avec sa bouche quelque bribe de fleur ou de verdure qu’elle soufflait vers lui, et qui voltigeant, se soutenant, faisant dans l’air des demi-cercles comme un oiseau, allait, avant de tomber, s’accrocher aux crins mal peignés de la vieille jument blanche, immobile à la porte. Charles, à cheval, lui envoyait un baiser ; elle répondait par un signe, elle refermait la fenêtre, il partait. Et alors, sur la grande route qui étendait sans en finir son long ruban de poussière, par les chemins creux où les arbres se courbaient en berceaux, dans les sentiers dont les blés lui montaient jusqu’aux genoux, avec le soleil sur ses épaules et l’air du matin à ses narines, le cœur plein des félicités de la nuit, l’esprit tranquille, la chair contente, il s’en allait ruminant son bonheur, comme ceux qui mâchent encore, après dîner, le goût des truffes qu’ils digèrent.","So he was happy and carefree for anything in the world. A meal for two, an evening walk on the main road, a wave of her hand on her headbands, the sight of her straw hat hanging on the window strip, and many other things. yet where Charles had never suspected pleasure, now made up the continuity of his happiness. In bed in the morning, and side by side on the pillow, he watched the sunlight pass through the down of his fair cheeks, half covered by the scalloped tabs of his bonnet. Seen so close, her eyes seemed to her to be enlarged, especially when she opened her eyelids several times in succession on waking; black in the shade and dark blue in broad daylight, they had like layers of successive colors, which, thicker in the background, became lighter towards the surface of the enamel. His own eye was lost in these depths, and he saw himself there as a small man up to his shoulders, with the scarf which covered his hair and the top of his shirt half open. He was getting up. She stood at the window to watch him leave; and she remained leaning on the edge, between two pots of geraniums, dressed in her bathrobe, which was loose around her. Charles, in the street, buckled his spurs on the bollard; and she continued to speak to him from above, while tearing with her mouth some scrap of flower or greenery which she blew towards him, and which fluttered, supported itself, making semicircles in the air like a bird. , was going, before falling, to cling to the unkempt manes of the old white mare, motionless at the door. Charles, on horseback, was blowing her a kiss; she replied with a sign, she closed the window, he left. And then, on the main road that endlessly stretched out its long ribbon of dust, through the sunken lanes where the trees bent like cradles, along the paths whose corn rose up to his knees, with the sun on his shoulders and the morning air in his nostrils, his heart full of the bliss of the night, his mind tranquil, his flesh content, he went away ruminating on his happiness, like those who still chew, after dinner, the taste of the truffles they they digest.","So he was happy, without a care in the world. A meal alone with her, a walk in the evening on the big road, the gesture of her hand touching the bands of her hair, the sight of her straw hat hanging from the hasp of a window, and many other things that Charles had never suspected would be a source of pleasure now formed the continuous flow of his happiness. In bed, in the morning, and side by side on the pillow, he would watch the sunlight passing through the down on her blond cheeks, half covered by the scalloped tabs of her nightcap. Seen from so close, her eyes appeared larger to him, especially when she opened her eyelids several times in succession as she awoke; black when in shadow and dark blue in broad daylight, they seemed to hold layer upon layer of colors, denser deep down and lighter and lighter toward the enameled surface. His own eyes would lose themselves in those depths, and he would see himself in miniature down to his 			shoulders, with the silk scarf he wore around his head and the top of his half-open nightshirt. He would get up. She would go to the window to watch him leave; and she would remain there with her elbows on the sill, between two pots of geraniums, her dressing gown loose around her. Charles, in the street, would be buckling his spurs, his foot up on the guard stone; and she would go on talking to him from above, tearing off with her teeth and blowing down to him some bit of flower or leaf, which would flutter, float, make half circles in the air like a bird, and catch, before falling, in the ill-combed mane of the old white mare, motionless at the door. Charles, on horseback, would send her a kiss; she would answer with a wave, she would close the window, he would leave. And then, on the highway stretching out before him in an endless ribbon of dust, along sunken lanes over which the trees bent like an arbor, in paths where the wheat rose as high as his knees, with the sun 			on his shoulders and the morning air in his nostrils, his heart full of the joys of the night, his spirit at peace, his flesh content, he would ride along ruminating on his happiness, like a man continuing to chew, after dinner, the taste of the truffles he is digesting.","He was happy now, without a care in the world. A meal alone with her, a stroll along the highway in the evening, the way she touched her hand to her hair, the sight of her straw hat hanging from a window hasp, and many other things in which it had never occurred to him to look for pleasure—such now formed the steady current of his happiness. In bed in the morning, his head beside hers on the pillow, he would watch the sunlight on the downy gold of her cheeks, half covered by the scalloped tabs of her nightcap. Seen from so close, her eyes appeared larger than life, especially when she opened and shut her eyelids several times on awakening: black when looked at in shadow, dark blue in bright light, they seemed to contain layer upon layer of color, thicker and cloudier beneath, lighter and more transparent toward the lustrous surface. As his own eyes plunged into those depths, he saw himself reflected there in miniature down to his shoulders—his foulard on his head, his nightshirt open. After he had dressed she would go to the window and watch him leave for his rounds; she would lean out between two pots of geraniums, her elbows on the sill, her dressing gown loose around her. In the street, Charles would strap on his spurs at the mounting-block; and she would continue to talk to him from above, blowing down to him some bit of flower or leaf she had bitten off in her teeth. It would flutter down hesitantly, weaving semicircles in the air like a bird, and before reaching the ground it would catch in the tangled mane of the old white mare standing motionless at the door. From the saddle Charles would send her a kiss; she would respond with a wave; then she would close the window, and he was off. And on the endless dusty ribbon of the highway, on sunken roads vaulted over by branches, on paths between stands of grain that rose to his knees—the sun on his shoulders and the morning air in his nostrils, his heart full of the night’s bliss, his spirit at peace and his flesh content—he would ride on his way ruminating his happiness, like someone who keeps savoring, hours later, the fragrance of the truffles he has eaten for dinner."

"Ils étaient convenus, elle et Rodolphe, qu’en cas d’événement extraordinaire, elle attacherait à la persienne un petit chiffon de papier blanc, afin que, si par hasard il se trouvait à Yonville, il accourût dans la ruelle, derrière la maison.

"Dès les premiers froids, Emma quitta sa chambre pour habiter la salle, longue pièce à plafond bas où il y avait, sur la cheminée, un polypier touffu s’étalant contre la glace. Assise dans son fauteuil, près de la fenêtre, elle voyait passer les gens du village sur le trottoir.","As soon as the first cold spells came, Emma left her room to live in the hall, a long room with a low ceiling where, on the mantelpiece, there was a tufted polypary spreading out against the mirror.

"Au bas de la côte, après le pont, commence une chaussée plantée de jeunes trembles, qui vous mène en droite ligne jusqu’aux premières maisons du pays. Elles sont encloses de haies, au milieu de cours pleines de bâtiments épars, pressoirs, charreteries et bouilleries, disséminés sous les arbres touffus portant des échelles, des gaules ou des faux accrochées dans leur branchage. Les toits de chaume, comme des bonnets de fourrure rabattus sur des yeux, descendent jusqu’au tiers à peu près des fenêtres basses, dont les gros verres bombés sont garnis d’un nœud dans le milieu, à la façon des culs de bouteilles. Sur le mur de plâtre que traversent en diagonale des lambourdes noires, s’accroche parfois quelque maigre poirier, et les rez-de-chaussée ont à leur porte une petite barrière tournante pour les défendre des poussins, qui viennent picorer, sur le seuil, des miettes de pain bis trempé de cidre. Cependant les cours se font plus étroites, les habitations se rapprochent, les haies disparaissent ; un fagot de fougères se balance sous une fenêtre au bout d’un manche à balai ; il y a la forge d’un maréchal et ensuite un charron avec deux ou trois charrettes neuves, en dehors, qui empiètent sur la route. Puis, à travers une claire-voie, apparaît une maison blanche au delà d’un rond de gazon que décore un Amour, le doigt posé sur la bouche ; deux vases en fonte sont à chaque bout du perron ; des panonceaux brillent à la porte ; c’est la maison du notaire, et la plus belle du pays.","At the bottom of the hill, after the bridge, begins a causeway planted with young aspens, which leads you in a straight line to the first houses in the country. They are enclosed by hedges, in the middle of courtyards full of scattered buildings, presses, charreteries and boilies, scattered under the thick trees bearing ladders, saplings or scythes hung in their branches. The thatched roofs, like fur caps pulled down over eyes, come down to about a third of the low windows, whose big domed glasses are trimmed with a knot in the middle, like the bottoms of bottles. On the plaster wall crossed diagonally by black joists sometimes hangs a meager pear tree, and the ground floors have at their door a small revolving barrier to protect them from chicks, who come to peck on the threshold. brown bread crumbs soaked in cider. However, the courtyards are narrower, the houses are closer together, the hedges are disappearing; a bundle of ferns swings under a window on the end of a broomstick; there is a blacksmith's forge and then a wheelwright with two or three new carts, outside, encroaching on the road. Then, through a skylight, appears a white house beyond a circle of grass decorated by a Cupid, his finger resting on his mouth; two cast iron vases are at each end of the steps; signs shine at the door; it is the house of the notary, and the most beautiful in the country.","At the foot of the hill, after the bridge, and planted with young aspens, begins a roadway leading you in a straight line to the first houses of the area. They are enclosed within hedges, in the middle of yards full of scattered outbuildings, presses, cart sheds, and distilleries standing here and there under dense trees bearing ladders, poles, or scythes hooked over their branches. The thatched roofs cover the top third or so of the low windows, like fur caps pulled down over eyes, and the thick, bulging panes are garnished with a nub in the middle, like the base of a bottle. Against the plaster wall, which is traversed diagonally by black timbers, there sometimes clings a thin pear tree, and the ground floors have at their door a little swing gate to guard them against the chicks, who come to the doorsill to peck at the crumbs of brown bread soaked in cider. Meanwhile, the yards become narrower, the habitations draw closer together, the hedges disappear; a 			bundle of ferns dangles below a window at the end of a broom handle; there is a farrier’s forge and then a cartwright with two or three new carts outside, jutting into the road. Then through the railings appears a white house beyond a circle of lawn decorated with a Cupid, its finger on its mouth; two cast-iron urns stand at either end of the flight of front steps; brass plates gleam at the door; it is the notary’s house, and the handsomest in the region.","At the foot of the hill the road crosses the Rieule on a bridge, and then, becoming an avenue planted with young aspens, leads in a straight line to the first outlying houses. These are surrounded by hedges, and their yards are full of scattered outbuildings—cider presses, carriage houses and distilling sheds standing here and there under thick trees with ladders and poles leaning against their trunks and scythes hooked over their branches. The thatched roofs hide the top third or so of the low windows like fur caps pulled down over eyes, and each windowpane, thick and convex, has a bull’s-eye in its center like the bottom of a bottle. Some of the plastered house walls with their diagonal black timbers are the background for scraggly espaliered pear trees; and the house doors have little swinging gates to keep out the baby chicks, who come to the sill to peck at brown-bread crumbs soaked in cider. Gradually the yards become narrower, houses are closer together, the hedges disappear; occasionally a fern broom put out to dry is seen hanging from a window; there is a blacksmith shop, a cart-maker’s with two or three new carts outside half blocking the roadway. Then comes a white house behind an iron fence, its circular lawn adorned by a cupid holding finger to lips. Two cast-iron urns stand at either end of the entrance terrace; brass plates gleam brightly at the door : this is the notary’s house, the finest in town."
"À trois pas d’Emma, un cavalier en habit bleu causait Italie avec une jeune femme pâle, portant une parure de perles. Ils vantaient la grosseur des piliers de Saint-Pierre, Tivoli, le Vésuve, Castellamare et les Cassines, les roses de Gênes, le Colisée au clair de lune. Emma écoutait de son autre oreille une conversation pleine de mots qu’elle ne comprenait pas. On entourait un tout jeune homme qui avait battu, la semaine d’avant, Miss Arabelle et Romulus, et gagné deux mille louis à sauter un fossé, en Angleterre. L’un se plaignait de ses coureurs qui engraissaient ; un autre, des fautes d’impression qui avaient dénaturé le nom de son cheval.","Three paces from Emma, a cavalier in a blue coat was talking about Italy with a pale young woman wearing a set of pearls.

Emma listened with her other ear to a conversation full of words she did not understand. They surrounded a very young man who had beaten, the week before, Miss Arabelle and Romulus, and won two thousand louis jumping a ditch in England. One complained of his runners who were getting fat; another, misprints that had misrepresented the name of his horse.","A few steps from Emma, a gentleman in a blue coat was deep into Italy with a pale young woman in pearls.

One of the speakers was complaining that his racers were putting on weight, another that misprints had made the name of his horse unrecognizable in the newspapers."

"Les murs des jardins, garnis à leur chaperon de morceaux de bouteilles, étaient chauds comme le vitrage d’une serre. Dans les briques, des ravenelles avaient poussé ; et, du bord de son ombrelle déployée, madame Bovary, tout en passant, faisait s’égrener en poussière jaune un peu de leurs fleurs flétries, ou bien quelque branche des chèvrefeuilles et des clématites qui pendaient en dehors traînait un moment sur la soie, en s’accrochant aux effilés.","The walls of the gardens, trimmed on their caps with broken bottles, were warm like the glass of a hothouse.

"Quant à Emma, elle ne s’interrogea point pour savoir si elle l’aimait. L’amour, croyait-elle, devait arriver tout à coup, avec de grands éclats et des fulgurations, – ouragan des cieux qui tombe sur la vie, la bouleverse, arrache les volontés comme des feuilles et emporte à l’abîme le cœur entier. Elle ne savait pas que, sur la terrasse des maisons, la pluie fait des lacs quand les gouttières sont bouchées, et elle fût ainsi demeurée en sa sécurité, lorsqu’elle découvrit subitement une lézarde dans le mur.","As for Emma, she did not ask herself whether she loved him. Love, she believed, had to come suddenly, with great bursts and flashes, – a hurricane from the heavens which falls on life, upsets it, tears away wills like leaves and carries the whole heart to the abyss. .

It never occurred to her that if the drainpipes of a house are clogged, the rain may collect in pools on the roof; and she suspected no danger until suddenly she discovered a crack in the wall."
"Il la questionna ; elle ne répondit pas. Elle se tenait immobile, de peur que la moindre émotion ne la fît vomir.

"Les ornières devinrent plus profondes. On approchait des Bertaux. Le petit gars, se coulant alors par un trou de haie, disparut, puis, il revint au bout d’une cour en ouvrir la barrière.

"Mais c’était surtout aux heures des repas qu’elle n’en pouvait plus, dans cette petite salle au rez-de-chaussée, avec le poêle qui fumait, la porte qui criait, les murs qui suintaient, les pavés humides ; toute l’amertume de l’existence, lui semblait servie sur son assiette, et, à la fumée du bouilli, il montait du fond de son âme comme d’autres bouffées d’affadissement.

"Quoiqu’elle fût laide, sèche comme un cotret, et bourgeonnée comme un printemps, certes madame Dubuc ne manquait pas de partis à choisir.

"La lune, toute ronde et couleur de pourpre, se levait à ras de terre, au fond de la prairie. Elle montait vite entre les branches des peupliers, qui la cachaient de place en place, comme un rideau noir, troué. Puis elle parut, éclatante de blancheur, dans le ciel vide qu’elle éclairait ; et alors, se ralentissant, elle laissa tomber sur la rivière une grande tache, qui faisait une infinité d’étoiles ; et cette lueur d’argent semblait s’y tordre jusqu’au fond, à la manière d’un serpent sans tête couvert d’écailles lumineuses. Cela ressemblait aussi à quelque monstrueux candélabre, d’où ruisselaient, tout du long, des gouttes de diamant en fusion. La nuit douce s’étalait autour d’eux ; des nappes d’ombre emplissaient les feuillages. Emma, les yeux à demi clos, aspirait avec de grands soupirs le vent frais qui soufflait.

Souvent quelque bête nocturne, hérisson ou belette, se mettant en chasse, dérangeait les feuilles, ou bien on entendait par moments une pêche mûre qui tombait toute seule de l’espalier.","The moon, all round and crimson in color, was rising at ground level, at the bottom of the meadow. She climbed quickly between the branches of the poplars, which hid her from place to place, like a black curtain with holes in it.

It also looked like some monstrous candelabra, from which streamed, all along, drops of molten diamond. The soft night spread around them; sheets of shadow filled the foliage. Emma, her eyes half closed, inhaled with great sighs the fresh wind that was blowing. They did not speak to each other, too lost as they were in the invasion of their reverie. The tenderness of the old days returned to their hearts, abundant and silent as the flowing river, with as much softness as the perfume of the syringas, and cast in their memory shadows more immense and more melancholy than those of the motionless willows which lay down on the grass. Often some nocturnal beast, hedgehog or weasel, setting out on the hunt disturbed the leaves, or sometimes you heard a ripe peach falling by itself from the espalier.","The moon, perfectly round and deep red, was rising straight from the earth, at the far end of the meadow. It climbed quickly among the branches of the poplars, which hid it in places like a black curtain full of holes.

Full and silent as the flowing river, languid as the perfume of the syringas, the sweetness they had known in earlier days once again surged up in their hearts, casting on their memories longer and more melancholy shadows than those of the motionless willows on the grass. Now and again some prowling night animal, hedgehog or weasel, disturbed the leaves; or they heard the sound of a ripe peach as it dropped to the ground."

"– Mais, sabre de bois ! s’écria l’ecclésiastique, comment voulez-vous qu’un individu pris dans le mariage puisse garder, par exemple, le secret de la confession ?","“Why, wooden sword! exclaimed the ecclesiastic, how do you expect an individual caught up in marriage to be able to keep, for example, the secret of confession?","“Well, hang it!” exclaimed the clergyman. “How do you expect an individual involved in a marriage to preserve the secrets of the confessional, for example?”","“But drat it all!” cried the priest. “How would you expect anyone who was married to be able to keep the secrets of the confessional, for example?”"
"Elle avait des dégoûts, cependant, de cette hypocrisie. Des tentations la prenaient de s’enfuir avec Léon, quelque part, bien loin, pour essayer une destinée nouvelle ; mais aussitôt il s’ouvrait dans son âme un gouffre vague, plein d’obscurité.","She had a distaste, however, for this hypocrisy. Temptations seized her to run away with Léon, somewhere, far away, to try a new destiny; but immediately there opened in his soul a vague gulf, full of obscurity.","There were times, however, when she was disgusted by this hypocrisy. She would be seized by the temptation to run off with Léon, somewhere far away, to try out a new destiny; but immediately a formless chasm, full of darkness, would open in her soul.","Still, there were times when she could scarcely stomach the hypocrisy. She would be seized with a longing to run off with Léon, escape to some far-off place where they could begin life anew; but at such moments she would shudder, feeling herself at the brink of a terrifying precipice."

"Elle se demanda même pourquoi donc elle exécrait Charles, et s’il n’eût pas été meilleur de le pouvoir aimer. Mais il n’offrait pas grande prise à ces retours du sentiment, si bien qu’elle demeurait fort embarrassée dans sa velléité de sacrifice, lorsque l’apothicaire vint à propos lui fournir une occasion.","She even wondered why she hated Charles, and whether it would not have been better to be able to love him. But he did not offer much support to these returns of sentiment, so much so that she remained very embarrassed in her desire for sacrifice, when the apothecary came at the right time to provide her with an opportunity.","She even asked herself why she despised Charles, and if it would not have been better to be able to love him. But he did not offer much of an opening for this renewal of affection, so that she was quite foiled in her momentary inclination for sacrifice, when the apothecary happened to provide her with a timely opportunity.","She even wondered why she detested Charles, and whether it mightn’t be better to try to love him. But there was so little about him to which her resurgent feeling could attach itself that she was at a loss as to how to put her noble resolution into effect. And then one day the apothecary provided the desired opportunity."
"– Ce sont les nerfs, répondait Emma ; ne lui en parle pas, tu l’affligerais.","“Nerves,” replied Emma; don't talk to him about it, you'll upset him.","“It’s nerves,” Emma would answer. “Don’t say anything to him; it would upset him.” “Oh, yes!”","“It’s nerves,” Emma would answer. “Don’t mention it to him. It would only upset him.” “Ah, yes,” Félicité said, one day."
"Charles revint donc encore une fois sur cette question du piano. Emma répondit, avec aigreur qu’il valait mieux le vendre. Ce pauvre piano, qui lui avait causé tant de vaniteuses satisfactions, le voir s’en aller, c’était pour Bovary comme l’indéfinissable suicide d’une partie d’elle-même !","Charles thus returned once more to this question of the piano. Emma answered, sourly that it was better to sell it. This poor piano, which had given her so much vain satisfaction, to see it go away was for Bovary like the indefinable suicide of a part of herself!","And so Charles returned once more to the question of the piano. Emma answered sourly that it would be better to sell it. That poor piano, which had so often given him a proud gratification—to see it go would somehow be, for Bovary, like seeing her kill a part of herself!","So Charles brought up the question of the piano again. Emma answered tartly that they’d better sell it. Poor old piano! It had so often been a source of pride for him, that to see it go would be like watching Emma commit partial suicide."
"Et il courut à son fils, qui venait de se précipiter dans un tas de chaux pour peindre ses souliers en blanc. Aux reproches dont on l’accablait, Napoléon se prit à pousser des hurlements, tandis que Justin lui essuyait ses chaussures avec un torchis de paille. Mais il eût fallu un couteau ; Charles offrit le sien.","And he ran to his son, who had just rushed into a heap of lime to paint his shoes white. At the reproaches heaped upon him, Napoleon began to howl, while Justin wiped his shoes with a daub of straw. But it would have required a knife; Charles offered his.","And he ran over to his son, who had just plunged into a heap of lime to coat his shoes with white. At the scoldings that rained down on him, Napoléon began to howl, while Justin wiped off his feet with a twist of straw. But a knife was needed; Charles offered his. “Ah!”","And he rushed over to his son, who had just jumped into a heap of lime to whiten his shoes. To his father’s scoldings Napoléon replied with howls; Justin scraped off the shoes with a bit of plaster; but a knife was needed, and Charles offered his. “Ah!”"
Emma n’eut point l’air d’accueillir cet espoir avec autant de joie qu’il l’avait imaginé. Soupçonnait-elle le mensonge ? Il reprit en rougissant :,"Emma did not seem to welcome this hope with as much joy as he had imagined. Did she suspect the lie? He resumed, blushing:","Emma did not seem to greet this hope with as much joy as he had imagined. Did she suspect he was lying? Blushing, he went on:",Emma didn’t appear to welcome this hope of relief as joyfully as he had thought. Did she suspect his lie? He blushed as he added:
"Le lendemain, madame Bovary mère arriva. Elle et son fils pleurèrent beaucoup. Emma, sous prétexte d’ordres à donner, disparut.","The next day, Madame Bovary senior arrived. She and her son cried a lot. Emma, under the pretext of giving orders, disappeared.","The next day, the elder Madame Bovary arrived. She and her son wept a good deal. Emma, under the pretext of having orders to give, disappeared.","The following day the older Madame Bovary arrived. She and her son did a good deal of weeping. Emma, pleading household duties, kept out of the way."
"– Non, non ! Tu l’aimes mieux que moi, et tu as raison, c’est dans l’ordre. Au reste, tant pis ! tu verras !… Bonne santé !… car je ne suis pas près, comme tu dis, de venir lui faire des scènes.","- No no ! You like him better than me, and you're right, that's okay. For the rest, too bad! you'll see!... Good health!... because I'm not ready, as you say, to come and make a scene for him.","“No, no! You love her more than me, and you’re right, that’s as it should be. As for the rest, it’s just too bad! You’ll see! … Take care of yourself! … because I’m not about to come back soon, making trouble for her, as you say.”","“No! No! You love her more than you do me, and you’re right; that’s as it should be. There’s nothing I can do about it. You’ll see, though … Take care of yourself … I can promise you it will be a long time before I come back here to ‘make scenes,’ as you put it.”"
Charles vint l’embrasser sur l’épaule.,Charles came to kiss her on the shoulder.,Charles came to kiss her on the shoulder.,Charles came up to kiss her on the shoulder.
"– Celle que vous avez là est bonne pour la maison. Il vous en faut une autre pour les visites. J’ai vu ça, moi, du premier coup en entrant. J’ai l’œil américain.","“The one you have there is good for the house. You need another one for visits. I saw that, me, the first time when I entered. I have an American eye.",“The one you have there is good enough for the house. You need another for visiting. I saw that right away when I came in. I have the eye of an American.”,"“The one you have there is all right for the house, but you need another for going out. I saw that the minute I came in. I’ve got an eye like a Yankee!”"
"– Oh ! reprit-il en riant d’un air bonhomme, on met tout ce que l’on veut sur les factures. Est-ce que je ne connais pas les ménages ?","- Oh ! he went on, laughing good-naturedly, you put whatever you want on the bills. Don't I know the households?","“Oh!” he replied, laughing good-naturedly, “one can put whatever one likes on a bill. Don’t you think I know something about household affairs?”","“What do you mean?” “Oh,” he said, with a jovial laugh, “there’s more than one way of making out a bill. Don’t you think I know how it is with married couples?”"
"Mais le coup était porté. Huit jours après, comme elle étendait du linge dans sa cour, elle fut prise d’un crachement de sang, et le lendemain, tandis que Charles avait le dos tourné pour fermer le rideau de la fenêtre, elle dit : « Ah ! mon Dieu ! » poussa un soupir et s’évanouit. Elle était morte ! Quel étonnement !","But the blow was struck. Eight days later, as she was hanging out laundry in her yard, she was seized with spitting blood, and the next day, while Charles had his back turned to close the window curtain, she said: “Ah! my God ! sighed and fainted. She was dead! What astonishment!","But the blow had struck home. A week later, as she was hanging the wash in her yard, she began spitting blood, and the next day, while Charles, his back turned, was at the window closing the curtain, she said: “Oh, my God!,” sighed, and lost consciousness. She was dead! How astonishing it was!","But—“the fatal blow had been struck.” A week later she was hanging out washing in her yard when suddenly she began to spit blood; and the next day, while Charles was looking the other way, drawing the window curtain, she gave a cry, then a sigh, and fainted.

"– Du reste, il n’en a pas pour longtemps, ajouta-t-elle ; avant huit jours, tout est fini.","""Besides, it won't be long,"" she added; before eight days, all is finished.","“Anyway, it won’t be there much longer,” she added; “another few days and that’ll be the end of it.”","“Anyway, it won’t be there much longer,” she said. “Just a few days more, and then—finis.”"
"Berthe alla tomber au pied de la commode, contre la patère de cuivre ; elle s’y coupa la joue, le sang sortit. Madame Bovary se précipita pour la relever, cassa le cordon de la sonnette, appela la servante de toutes ses forces, et elle allait commencer à se maudire, lorsque Charles parut. C’était l’heure du dîner, il rentrait.","Berthe went and fell at the foot of the chest of drawers, against the brass peg; she cut her cheek on it, the blood came out.

It was dinner time, he was coming home.","Berthe fell at the foot of the chest of drawers, against the brass fittings; she cut her cheek; the blood ran.

It was dinnertime, he had come home.","Berthe fell just at the foot of the chest of drawers, cutting her cheek on one of its brasses. She began to bleed.

"– Non, répondit-elle.","“No,” she replied.","“No,” she answered.","“Shall I renew it?” “No,” she answered."
Mais elles s’étaient enfuies toutes les deux dans leur exaspération. Emma trépignait en répétant :,But they had both fled in their exasperation. Emma stamped her feet repeating:,"But they had both fled the room in their rage. Emma kept stamping her foot with fury, saying over and over: “Oh!",But in their rage they both rushed from the room.
"L’enfant se baissa. Homais fut plus prompt, et, ayant ramassé le volume, il le contemplait, les yeux écarquillés, la mâchoire ouverte.","The child bent down.

"– C’est que j’aime, reprit-il en se penchant sur son épaule, à me rendre compte, tu sais bien.","“That’s what I love,” he went on, leaning over her shoulder, realizing it, you know.","“It’s just that, as you know,” he went on, leaning over her shoulder, “I do like to understand.”","“But I like to know what’s going on,” he persisted, leaning over her shoulder. “You know I do.”"
"Mais elle était si jolie ! il en avait possédé si peu d’une candeur pareille ! Cet amour sans libertinage était pour lui quelque chose de nouveau, et qui, le sortant de ses habitudes faciles, caressait à la fois son orgueil et sa sensualité. L’exaltation d’Emma, que son bon sens bourgeois dédaignait, lui semblait au fond du cœur charmante, puisqu’elle s’adressait à sa personne. Alors, sûr d’être aimé, il ne se gêna pas, et insensiblement ses façons changèrent.","But she was so pretty! he had possessed so few of such candor! This love without licentiousness was for him something new, and which, taking him out of his easy habits, caressed both his pride and his sensuality. Emma's exaltation, which her bourgeois good sense disdained, seemed to her at the bottom of her heart charming, since it was addressed to her person. Then, sure of being loved, he did not hesitate, and imperceptibly his ways changed.","But she was so pretty! And he had possessed few women as ingenuous as she! This love, so free of licentiousness, was a new thing for him and, drawing him out of his easy ways, both flattered his pride and inflamed his sensuality.

And so, certain of being loved, he stopped making any effort, and imperceptibly his manner changed.","But she was so pretty! He couldn’t remember ever having had so unspoiled a mistress. The purity of her love was something entirely new to him. It was a change from his usual loose habits, and it both flattered his pride and inflamed his senses. Emma’s continual raptures, which his bourgeois common sense despised, seemed to him in his heart of hearts charming, since it was he who inspired them. As time went on he stopped making any effort, secure in the knowledge that he was loved; and imperceptibly his manner changed."
"Jusqu’à présent, qu’avait-il eu de bon dans l’existence ? Était-ce son temps de collège, où il restait enfermé entre ces hauts murs, seul au milieu de ses camarades plus riches ou plus forts que lui dans leurs classes, qu’il faisait rire par son accent, qui se moquaient de ses habits, et dont les mères venaient au parloir avec des pâtisseries dans leur manchon ? Était-ce plus tard, lorsqu’il étudiait la médecine et n’avait jamais la bourse assez ronde pour payer la contredanse à quelque petite ouvrière qui fût devenue sa maîtresse ? Ensuite il avait vécu pendant quatorze mois avec la veuve, dont les pieds, dans le lit, étaient froids comme des glaçons. Mais, à présent, il possédait pour la vie cette jolie femme qu’il adorait. L’univers, pour lui, n’excédait pas le tour soyeux de son jupon ; et il se reprochait de ne pas l’aimer, il avait envie de la revoir ; il s’en revenait vite, montait l’escalier ; le cœur battant. Emma, dans sa chambre, était à faire sa toilette ; il arrivait à pas muets, il la baisait dans le dos, elle poussait un cri.","So far, what good had he had in life? Was it his school days, where he remained enclosed between these high walls, alone in the midst of his classmates who were richer or stronger than him in their classes, whom he made laugh with his accent, who made fun of his clothes, and whose mothers came to the parlor with pastries in their muffs? Was it later, when he was studying medicine and never had the purse big enough to pay for the contredanse for some little worker who had become his mistress? Then he had lived for fourteen months with the widow, whose feet in the bed were cold as icicles. But now he possessed for life this pretty woman he adored. The universe, for him, did not go beyond the silky turn of her petticoat; and he reproached himself for not loving her, he longed to see her again; he was coming back quickly, going up the stairs; the beating heart. Emma, in her room, was dressing; he arrived with mute steps, he kissed her on the back, she let out a cry.","Up to now, what had there been in his life that was good? Was it his time in school, where he remained shut in between those high walls, alone among schoolmates wealthier or better than he at their studies, who laughed at his accent, who made fun of his clothes, and whose mothers came to the visiting room with pastries in their muffs? Was it later, when he was studying medicine, his purse never fat enough to pay for a contra dance with some little working girl who might have become his mistress? After that, he had lived for fourteen months with the widow, whose feet, in bed, were as cold as blocks of ice. But now he possessed, for always, this pretty woman whom he so loved. The universe, for him, did not extend beyond the silky contour of her underskirt; and he would reproach himself for not loving her more, he would want to see her again; he would return home quickly, climb the stairs, his heart pounding. Emma, in her room, would be 			dressing; he would come in on silent feet, he would kiss her on the back, she would cry out.","Up until now, had there ever been a happy time in his life? His years at the lycée, where he had lived shut in behind high walls, lonely among richer, cleverer schoolmates who laughed at his country accent and made fun of his clothes and whose mothers brought them cookies in their muffs on visiting days? Or later, when he was studying medicine and hadn’t enough in his purse to go dancing with some little working girl who might have become his mistress? After that he had lived fourteen months with the widow, whose feet in bed had been like icicles. But now he possessed, and for always, this pretty wife whom he so loved. The universe, for him, went not beyond the silken circuit of her petticoat; and he would reproach himself for not showing her his love, and yearn to be back with her. He would gallop home, rush upstairs, his heart pounding. Emma would be at her dressing table; he would creep up silently behind her and kiss her; she would cry out in surprise."
– M’aimes-tu ?,- Do you love me ?,"And if he confessed that he had not thought of her, there would be a torrent of reproaches, always ending with the eternal question: “Do you love me?”",“Do you love me?”
"Lucie s’avançait, à demi soutenue par ses femmes, une couronne d’oranger dans les cheveux, et plus pâle que le satin blanc de sa robe. Emma rêvait au jour de son mariage ; et elle se revoyait là-bas, au milieu des blés, sur le petit sentier, quand on marchait vers l’église. Pourquoi donc n’avait-elle pas, comme celle-là, résisté, supplié ? Elle était joyeuse, au contraire, sans s’apercevoir de l’abîme où elle se précipitait… Ah ! si, dans la fraîcheur de sa beauté, avant les souillures du mariage et la désillusion de l’adultère, elle avait pu placer sa vie sur quelque grand cœur solide, alors la vertu, la tendresse, les voluptés et le devoir se confondant, jamais elle ne serait descendue d’une félicité si haute. Mais ce bonheur-là, sans doute, était un mensonge imaginé pour le désespoir de tout désir. Elle connaissait à présent la petitesse des passions que l’art exagérait. S’efforçant donc d’en détourner sa pensée, Emma voulait ne plus voir dans cette reproduction de ses douleurs qu’une fantaisie plastique bonne à amuser les yeux, et même elle souriait intérieurement d’une pitié dédaigneuse, quand au fond du théâtre, sous la portière de velours, un homme apparut en manteau noir.","Lucie advanced, half supported by her women, a wreath of orange blossom in her hair, and paler than the white satin of her dress. Emma dreamed of her wedding day; and she saw herself again over there, in the middle of the corn, on the little path, when we were walking towards the church. Why then hadn't she, like that one, resisted, begged? She was joyful, on the contrary, without noticing the abyss into which she was throwing herself. Ah! if, in the freshness of her beauty, before the stains of marriage and the disappointment of adultery, she had been able to place her life on some great solid heart, then virtue, tenderness, pleasures and duty blending, never she would never have descended from such lofty bliss. But that happiness, no doubt, was a lie imagined for the despair of all desire. She knew now the smallness of the passions that art exaggerated. Trying therefore to divert her thoughts from it, Emma wanted to see in this reproduction of her pains no more than a plastic fantasy good for amusing the eyes, and she even smiled inwardly with a disdainful pity, when at the back of the theatre, under the velvet door, a man appeared in a black coat.","Lucie was coming forward, half borne up by her women, a wreath of orange blossoms in her hair, and paler than the white satin of her dress. Emma was dreaming of her own wedding day; and she saw herself back there again, surrounded by wheat fields, on the little path, when they were walking toward the church. Why hadn’t she, like this woman, resisted, pleaded? On the contrary, she had been full of joy, unaware of the abyss into which she was rushing … Ah! if only, in the freshness of her beauty, before the defilement of marriage and the disillusionment of adultery, she could have set down her life upon some great, solid heart, then virtue, tenderness, desire, and duty would all have joined together, and she would never have descended from such lofty felicity. But that happiness, no doubt, was a lie imagined in despair of all desire. She knew, now, how paltry were the passions exaggerated by art. So, endeavoring to turn her thoughts away from 			this, Emma now determined to regard this replication of her sufferings as nothing more than a vivid fantasy for the entertainment of the eye, and she was even smiling to herself in disdainful pity, when at the back of the stage, from behind the velvet curtains, appeared a man in a black cloak.","Lucie came on, half borne up by her women; there was a wreath of orange blossoms in her hair, and she was paler than the white satin of her gown. Emma thought of her own wedding day: she saw herself walking toward the church along the little path amid the wheatfields. Why in heaven’s name hadn’t she resisted and entreated, like Lucie? But no—she had been light-hearted, unaware of the abyss she was rushing toward. Ah! If only in the freshness of her beauty, before defiling herself in marriage, before the disillusionments of adultery, she could have found some great and noble heart to be her life’s foundation! Then virtue and affection, sensual joys and duty would all have been one; and she would never have fallen from her high felicity. But that kind of happiness was doubtless a lie, invented to make one despair of any love. Now she well knew the true paltriness of the passions that art painted so large. So she did her best to think of the opera in a different light: she resolved to regard this image of her own griefs as a vivid fantasy, an enjoyable spectacle and nothing more; and she was actually smiling to herself in scornful pity when from behind the velvet curtains at the back of the stage there appeared a man in a black cloak."

"Son profil était si calme, que l’on n’y devinait rien. Il se détachait en pleine lumière, dans l’ovale de sa capote qui avait des rubans pâles ressemblant à des feuilles de roseau. Ses yeux aux longs cils courbes regardaient devant elle, et, quoique bien ouverts, ils semblaient un peu bridés par les pommettes, à cause du sang, qui battait doucement sous sa peau fine.

"Secrétaire d’État sous la Restauration, le Marquis, cherchant à rentrer dans la vie politique, préparait de longue main sa candidature à la Chambre des députés. Il faisait, l’hiver, de nombreuses distributions de fagots, et, au Conseil général, réclamait avec exaltation toujours des routes pour son arrondissement. Il avait eu, lors des grandes chaleurs, un abcès dans la bouche, dont Charles l’avait soulagé comme par miracle, en y donnant à point un coup de lancette. L’homme d’affaires, envoyé à Tostes pour payer l’opération, conta, le soir, qu’il avait vu dans le jardinet du médecin des cerises superbes. Or, les cerisiers poussaient mal à la Vaubyessard, M. le Marquis demanda quelques boutures à Bovary, se fit un devoir de l’en remercier lui-même, aperçut Emma, trouva qu’elle avait une jolie taille et qu’elle ne saluait point en paysanne ; si bien qu’on ne crut pas au château outrepasser les bornes de la condescendance, ni d’autre part commettre une maladresse, en invitant le jeune ménage.","Secretary of State under the Restoration, the Marquis, seeking to enter political life, had been preparing his candidacy for the Chamber of Deputies for a long time. In winter, he made numerous distributions of fagots, and, at the General Council, always demanded with exaltation roads for his district. During the hot weather, he had had an abscess in his mouth, from which Charles had relieved him, as if by a miracle, by giving it a quick thrust with a lancet. The businessman, sent to Tostes to pay for the operation, related that evening that he had seen some superb cherries in the doctor's garden. Now, the cherry trees were growing badly at Vaubyessard, M. le Marquis asked Bovary for some cuttings, made it his duty to thank him for them himself, saw Emma, found that she had a pretty figure and that she did not greet point in peasant; so much so that the chateau did not think it was going beyond the bounds of condescension, nor on the other hand committing a clumsiness, by inviting the young couple.","Secretary of State during the Restoration, the Marquis, seeking to reenter political life, had long been preparing for his candidacy for the Chamber of Deputies. In winter, he would make generous distributions of firewood, and, at departmental council meetings, he was always eloquent in demanding better roads for his district. He had had, during the very hot weather, an abscess in his mouth, of which Charles had relieved him as though miraculously, by giving it just the right nick of his lancet. The steward, sent to Tostes to pay for the operation, reported, that evening, that he had seen some superb cherries in the doctor’s little garden. Now, the cherry trees at La Vaubyessard were not doing well, Monsieur the Marquis asked Bovary for some cuttings, took it upon himself to thank him for them in person, noticed Emma, thought that she had a pretty figure and that she did not greet him like a peasant; and so at the château they did not believe they were going beyond the bounds of condescension nor, on the other hand, making a blunder, by inviting the young couple.","The marquis had been a member of the cabinet under the Restoration; and now, hoping to re-enter political life, he was paving the way for his candidature to the Chamber of Deputies. He made generous distributions of firewood among the poor in the winter, and in sessions of the departmental council he was always eloquent in demanding better roads for his district. During the hot weather he had had a mouth abscess, which Charles had relieved—miraculously, it seemed—by a timely nick of the scalpel. His steward, sent to Tostes to pay the bill for the operation, reported that evening that he had seen some superb cherries in the doctor’s little garden. The cherry trees at La Vaubyessard weren’t doing well; Monsieur le marquis asked Charles for a few grafts, made a point of going to thank him personally, saw Emma, and noticed that she had a pretty figure and didn’t curtsy like a peasant. So at the chateau it was decided that the doctor and his young wife could be invited without any transgression of the limits of condescension, and at the same time could be counted on to behave with decorum among their betters."
Il exigea l’arriéré d’anciennes visites. On lui montra les lettres que sa femme avait envoyées. Alors il fallut faire des excuses.,He demanded the backlog of old visits. He was shown the letters his wife had sent. So we had to apologize.,He tried to collect long-outstanding payments for professional visits. He was shown the letters his wife had sent.

– Se douterait-il de quelque chose ? se demandait Léon. Il avait des battements de cœur et se perdait en conjectures.,"""Did he suspect something?"" Leon wondered. He had a heartbeat and was lost in guesswork.","“Could he suspect something?” Léon wondered.

"Il n’osait lui faire des questions ; mais, la discernant si expérimentée, elle avait dû passer, se disait-il, par toutes les épreuves de la souffrance et du plaisir. Ce qui le charmait autrefois l’effrayait un peu maintenant. D’ailleurs, il se révoltait contre l’absorption, chaque jour plus grande, de sa personnalité. Il en voulait à Emma de cette victoire permanente. Il s’efforçait même à ne pas la chérir ; puis, au craquement de ses bottines, il se sentait lâche, comme les ivrognes à la vue des liqueurs fortes.","He dared not ask her questions; but, seeing her so experienced, she must have passed, he told himself, through all the trials of pain and pleasure. What once charmed him frightened him a little now. Besides, he revolted against the daily greater absorption of his personality. He resented Emma for this permanent victory. He even tried not to cherish her; then, at the creak of his boots, he felt cowardly, like drunkards at the sight of strong liquors.","He did not dare question her; but, understanding how experienced she was, he would say to himself that she must have passed through every ordeal of suffering and pleasure.

He resented Emma for this perpetual victory. He even attempted to stop loving her; then, at the creak of her little boots, he would feel how cowardly he was, like a drunkard at the sight of strong liquor.","He didn’t dare question her; but realizing how experienced she was, he told himself that she must have known the utmost extremes of suffering and pleasure. What had once charmed him he now found a little frightening. Then, too, he rebelled against the way his personality was increasingly being submerged: he resented her perpetual triumph over him. He even did his best to stop loving her; then at the sound of her footsteps he would feel his will desert him, like a drunkard at the sight of strong liquor."

"– Cependant ils fatiguent à la longue, reprit Emma ; et maintenant, au contraire, j’adore les histoires qui se suivent tout d’une haleine, où l’on a peur. Je déteste les héros communs et les sentiments tempérés, comme il y en a dans la nature.","“However, they tire in the long run,” resumed Emma; and now, on the contrary, I love stories that follow each other in one breath, where you are afraid. I hate common heroes and temperate sentiments, such as there are in nature.","“Yet they’re tiresome in the end,” Emma said; “these days, what I really adore are stories that can be read all in one go, and that frighten you. I detest common heroes and moderate feelings, the sort that exist in real life.”","“Still, it’s tiresome in the long run,” Emma replied. “Nowadays I’m crazy about a different kind of thing—stories full of suspense, stories that frighten you. I hate to read about low-class heroes and their down-to-earth concerns, the sort of thing the real world’s full of.”"
"Mais, le lendemain, à midi, elle reçut un protêt ; et la vue du papier timbré, où s’étalait à plusieurs reprises et en gros caractères : « Maître Hareng, huissier à Buchy », l’effraya si fort, qu’elle courut en toute hâte chez le marchand d’étoffes.","But the next day, at noon, she received a protest; and the sight of the stamped paper, on which was spread out several times and in large characters: ""Maître Hareng, usher at Buchy,"" frightened her so much that she ran in all haste to the cloth merchant.","But the next day, at noon, she received a protest of nonpayment; and the sight of the official document, on which were displayed, in several places and in large letters, the words “Maître Hareng, Bailiff at Bucy,” frightened her so much that she ran in all haste to the dry-goods merchant.","But the next day, at noon, she received a protest of nonpayment; and the sight of the official document, bearing the words “Maître Hareng, huissier at Buchy” several times in large letters, gave her such a fright that she hurried to the dry-goods merchant."

"– Pauvre petite femme ! pensa-t-il avec attendrissement. Elle va me croire plus insensible qu’un roc ; il eût fallu quelques larmes là-dessus ; mais, moi, je ne peux pas pleurer ; ce n’est pas ma faute. Alors, s’étant versé de l’eau dans un verre, Rodolphe y trempa son doigt et il laissa tomber de haut une grosse goutte, qui fit une tache pâle sur l’encre ; puis, cherchant à cacheter la lettre, le cachet Amor nel cor se rencontra.","“Poor little woman! he thought fondly. She will think me more insensitive than a rock; it would have taken a few tears over that; but, me, I cannot cry; it's not my fault.

There ought to be a few tears on it, but weeping’s beyond me—what can I do?” He poured some water in a glass, wet a finger, and holding it high above the page shook off a large drop. It made a pale blot on the ink. Then, looking around for something to seal the letter with, his eye fell on the signet ring with the motto “Amor nel cor.”"

"Ce n’était point par vanité territoriale que le nouvel arrivant avait ajouté à son nom la particule, mais afin de se faire mieux connaître.

"– Certainement, je m’y entends, puisque je suis pharmacien, c’est-à-dire chimiste ! et la chimie, madame Lefrançois, ayant pour objet la connaissance de l’action réciproque et moléculaire de tous les corps de la nature, il s’ensuit que l’agriculture se trouve comprise dans son domaine !

"Il souffrait, le pauvre homme, à la voir si mal vêtue, avec ses brodequins sans lacet et l’emmanchure de ses blouses déchirée jusqu’aux hanches, car la femme de ménage n’en prenait guère de souci. Mais elle était si douce, si gentille, et sa petite tête se penchait si gracieusement en laissant retomber sur ses joues roses sa bonne chevelure blonde, qu’une délectation infinie l’envahissait, plaisir tout mêlé d’amertume comme ces vins mal faits qui sentent la résine. Il raccommodait ses joujoux, lui fabriquait des pantins avec du carton, ou recousait le ventre déchiré de ses poupées. Puis, s’il rencontrait des yeux la boîte à ouvrage, un ruban qui traînait ou même une épingle restée dans une fente de la table, il se prenait à rêver, et il avait l’air si triste, qu’elle devenait triste comme lui.","He suffered, the poor man, to see her so badly dressed, with her boots without laces and the armholes of her blouses torn down to the hips, for the housekeeper did not care. But she was so gentle, so kind, and her little head leaned so gracefully, letting her good fair hair fall on her rosy cheeks, that an infinite delight invaded her, a pleasure mixed with bitterness like those badly made wines which smell of resin. He mended his toys, made him puppets out of cardboard, or sewed up the torn bellies of his dolls. Then, if his eyes met the workbox, a ribbon lying around, or even a pin left in a crack in the table, he began to dream, and he looked so sad that she became sad as him.","It pained the poor man to see her so shabbily dressed, her ankle boots missing their laces and the armholes of her smocks torn down to the hips—because the woman who came in to clean hardly took any notice of her. But she was so gentle, so sweet, and she bent her little head so gracefully, letting her lovely blond hair fall over her pink cheeks, that he was filled with an infinite pleasure, a delight permeated with bitterness like those badly made wines that smell of resin. He would mend her playthings, make jumping jacks for her out of cardboard, or sew up the torn stomachs of her dolls. Then, if his eye fell on the sewing box, on a trailing ribbon or even a pin caught in a crack in the table, he would sink into a reverie, and he looked so sad that she, too, like him, would grow sad.","It pained him, poor fellow, to see her so shabbily dressed, with her shoes unlaced and the armholes of her smock torn and gaping to below her waist—for the cleaning woman completely neglected her. But she was so sweet and gentle, and she bent her little head so gracefully, letting her fair hair fall against her rosy cheek, that he was flooded with infinite pleasure—an enjoyment that was mixed with bitterness, like an inferior wine tasting of resin. He mended her toys, made puppets for her out of cardboard, sewed up the torn stomachs of her dolls. But the sight of the sewing-box, or a bit of loose ribbon, or even a pin caught in a crack in the table, would send him brooding; and then he looked so gloomy that she, too, grew sad."

"C’était une manière de permission qu’elle se donnait de ne point se gêner dans ses escapades. Aussi en profita-t-elle tout à son aise, largement.

"Lorsque, du haut de la côte, il aperçut dans la vallée le clocher de l’église avec son drapeau de fer-blanc qui tournait au vent, il sentit cette délectation mêlée de vanité triomphante et d’attendrissement égoïste que doivent avoir les millionnaires, quand ils reviennent visiter leur village.","When, from the top of the hill, he saw in the valley the steeple of the church with its tin flag waving in the wind, he felt that delight mixed with triumphant vanity and selfish tenderness which millionaires must have, when they return to visit their village.","When, from the top of the hill, he saw the church steeple in the valley below with its tin flag turning in the wind, he felt the same pleasure, compounded of triumphant vanity and egotistical affection, that a millionaire must experience when returning to his native village.","When he looked down on the valley from the top of the hill and saw the church steeple with its tin flag turning in the wind, he was filled with an exquisite pleasure: smug satisfaction and selfish sentimentality were mingled in it—it was the feeling that a millionaire must experience on revisiting his boyhood village."

"La chose difficile était le consentement de sa mère ; rien pourtant ne paraissait plus raisonnable. Son patron même l’engageait à visiter une autre étude, où il pût se développer davantage.

"Ils arrivèrent, en effet, ces fameux Comices ! Dès le matin de la solennité, tous les habitants, sur leurs portes, s’entretenaient des préparatifs ; on avait enguirlandé de lierres le fronton de la mairie ; une tente dans un pré était dressée pour le festin, et, au milieu de la Place, devant l’église, une espèce de bombarde devait signaler l’arrivée de M. le préfet et le nom des cultivateurs lauréats. La garde nationale de Buchy (il n’y en avait point à Yonville) était venue s’adjoindre au corps des pompiers, dont Binet était le capitaine. Il portait ce jour-là un col encore plus haut que de coutume ; et, sanglé dans sa tunique, il avait le buste si roide et immobile, que toute la partie vitale de sa personne semblait être descendue dans ses deux jambes, qui se levaient en cadence, à pas marqués, d’un seul mouvement. Comme une rivalité subsistait entre le percepteur et le colonel, l’un et l’autre, pour montrer leurs talents, faisaient à part manœuvrer leurs hommes. On voyait alternativement passer et repasser les épaulettes rouges et les plastrons noirs. Cela ne finissait pas et toujours recommençait ! Jamais il n’y avait eu pareil déploiement de pompe ! Plusieurs bourgeois, dès la veille, avaient lavé leurs maisons ; des drapeaux tricolores pendaient aux fenêtres entrouvertes ; tous les cabarets étaient pleins ; et, par le beau temps qu’il faisait, les bonnets empesés, les croix d’or et les fichus de couleur paraissaient plus blancs que neige, miroitaient au soleil clair, et relevaient de leur bigarrure éparpillée la sombre monotonie des redingotes et des bourgerons bleus. Les fermières des environs retiraient, en descendant de cheval, la grosse épingle qui leur serrait autour du corps leur robe retroussée de peur des taches ; et les maris, au contraire, afin de ménager leurs chapeaux, gardaient par-dessus des mouchoirs de poche, dont ils tenaient un angle entre les dents.","They arrived, indeed, these famous Comices! From the morning of the solemnity, all the inhabitants, at their doors, discussed the preparations; the pediment of the town hall had been garlanded with ivy; a tent in a meadow was pitched for the feast, and in the middle of the square, in front of the church, a kind of bombard was to signal the arrival of the prefect and the names of the laureate farmers. The National Guard of Buchy (there was none at Yonville) had come to join the corps of firefighters, of which Binet was the captain. That day he wore a collar even higher than usual; and, strapped in his tunic, his chest was so stiff and motionless that the whole vital part of his person seemed to have descended into his two legs, which rose in cadence, with marked steps, in a single movement. As a rivalry continued between the collector and the colonel, both, to show their talents, had their men maneuver separately. You could see the red epaulettes and the black breastplates passing and re-passing alternately. It never ended and always started again! Never had there been such a deployment of pump! Several bourgeois, the day before, had washed their houses; tricolor flags hung from the half-open windows; all the cabarets were full; and, in the fine weather, the starched caps, the gold crosses and the colored neckerchiefs seemed whiter than snow, shimmered in the bright sun, and raised with their scattered variegation the gloomy monotony of the frock coats and smocks. blue. The local farmers' wives removed, as they got off their horses, the big pin which tied around their bodies their dresses, which had been rolled up for fear of stains; and the husbands, on the contrary, in order to save their hats, kept pocket handkerchiefs over them, holding an angle between their teeth.","It was here at last, the day of the famous Agricultural Fair! On the morning of the solemn occasion, all the townspeople were at their doors talking about the preparations; the pediment of the town hall had been festooned with ivy; a tent for the banquet had been set up in a field; and, in the middle of the Square, in front of the church, a sort of ancient cannon was to signal the arrival of the Prefect and the naming of the prizewinning farmers. The national guard from Buchy (there was none at Yonville) had come to join the fire brigade, of which Binet was captain. On this day he was wearing a collar even higher than usual; and his chest, buttoned up tight in his tunic, was so stiff and motionless that all the vitality of his being seemed to have descended into his two legs, which rose in cadence, in rhythmic steps, with a single motion. Because a rivalry existed between the tax collector and the colonel, each of them, to show off his talents, 			took his men separately through their maneuvers. The red epaulets and the black breastplates could be seen turn by turn passing back and forth. There was no end to it, and it kept beginning again! Never had there been such a display of magnificence! A number of townspeople, the day before, had washed their houses; tricolored flags were hanging from the half-open windows; all the taverns were full; and in the good weather that prevailed, the starched headdresses, the gold crosses, and the multicolored fichus gleamed whiter than snow, sparkled in the bright sun, and relieved with their scattered hues the somber monotony of the frock coats and blue smocks. The farmwives from the surrounding regions, after descending from their horses, withdrew the large pin with which they had held their dresses tucked up close around their bodies for fear of spots; while their husbands, by contrast, in order to protect their hats, kept a pocket handkerchief over them, holding one corner 			between their teeth.","The great day arrived at last. The morning of the Agricultural Show all the Yonvillians were standing on their doorsteps discussing the preparations. The pediment of the town hall had been looped with ivy; a marquee had been set up for the banquet in one of the meadows; and in the middle of the square, in front of the church, stood an antiquated fieldpiece that was to be fired as a signal announcing the arrival of the prefect and the proclamation of the prize winners. The Buchy national guard (Yonville had none) had come to join forces with the fire brigade, commanded by Binet. Today he wore a collar even higher than usual; and his bust, tightly encased in his tunic, was so stiff and inflexible that all his animal fluids seemed to be concentrated in his legs, which rose and fell with the music in rhythmic jerks. Since the tax collector and the colonel were rivals, each showed off his talents by drilling his men separately. First the red epaulettes would march up and down, and then the black breastplates. And then it would begin all over again: there was no end to it. Never had there been such a display of pomp! A number of citizens had washed their housefronts the day before; tricolor flags were hanging from half-open windows; all the cafés were full; and in the perfect weather the headdresses of the women seemed whiter than snow, their gold crosses glittered in the bright sun, and their multicolored neckcloths relieved the somber monotony of the men’s frock coats and blue smocks. As the farm women dismounted from their horses they undid the big pins that had held their skirts tucked up away from splashing. The men’s concern was for their hats: to protect them they had covered them with large pocket handkerchiefs, holding the corners between their teeth as they rode."

"À douze ans, sa mère obtint que l’on commençât ses études. On en chargea le curé. Mais les leçons étaient si courtes et si mal suivies, qu’elles ne pouvaient servir à grand-chose. C’était aux moments perdus qu’elles se donnaient, dans la sacristie, debout, à la hâte, entre un baptême et un enterrement ; ou bien le curé envoyait chercher son élève après l’Angélus, quand il n’avait pas à sortir. On montait dans sa chambre, on s’installait : les moucherons et les papillons de nuit tournoyaient autour de la chandelle. Il faisait chaud, l’enfant s’endormait ; et le bonhomme, s’assoupissant les mains sur son ventre, ne tardait pas à ronfler, la bouche ouverte. D’autres fois, quand M. le curé, revenant de porter le viatique à quelque malade des environs, apercevait Charles qui polissonnait dans la campagne, il l’appelait, le sermonnait un quart d’heure et profitait de l’occasion pour lui faire conjuguer son verbe au pied d’un arbre.

It was hot, the child was falling asleep; and the good man, dozing off with his hands on his belly, was soon snoring with his mouth open.

The rain came to interrupt them, or a passing acquaintance.

"La journée fut longue, le lendemain !

How remote the ball already was! What was it that made tonight seem so very far removed from the day before yesterday? Her visit to La Vaubyessard had opened a breach in her life, like one of those great crevasses that a storm can tear across the face of a mountain in the course of a single night. But there was nothing to do about it. She put her beautiful ball costume reverently away in a drawer—even to her satin slippers, whose soles were yellow from the slippery wax of the dance floor. Her heart was like them: contact with luxury had left an indelible mark on it."

"« Mais messieurs, poursuivait le Conseiller, que si, écartant de mon souvenir ces sombres tableaux, je reporte mes yeux sur la situation actuelle de notre belle patrie : qu’y vois-je ? Partout fleurissent le commerce et les arts ; partout des voies nouvelles de communication, comme autant d’artères nouvelles dans le corps de l’État, y établissent des rapports nouveaux ; nos grands centres manufacturiers ont repris leur activité ; la religion, plus affermie, sourit à tous les cœurs ; nos ports sont pleins, la confiance renaît, et enfin la France respire !… »","“But gentlemen, continued the Counselor, if, putting aside these gloomy pictures from my memory, I turn my eyes back to the current situation of our beautiful homeland: what do I see there?

"Quant à Charles, il ne chercha point à se demander pourquoi il venait aux Bertaux avec plaisir. Y eût-il songé, qu’il aurait sans doute attribué son zèle à la gravité du cas, ou peut-être au profit qu’il en espérait. Était-ce pour cela, cependant, que ses visites à la ferme faisaient, parmi les pauvres occupations de sa vie, une exception charmante ? Ces jours-là il se levait de bonne heure, partait au galop, poussait sa bête, puis il descendait pour s’essuyer les pieds sur l’herbe, et passait ses gants noirs avant d’entrer. Il aimait à se voir arriver dans la cour, à sentir contre son épaule la barrière qui tournait, et le coq qui chantait sur le mur, les garçons qui venaient à sa rencontre. Il aimait la grange et les écuries ; il aimait le père Rouault ; qui lui tapait dans la main en l’appelant son sauveur ; il aimait les petits sabots de mademoiselle Emma sur les dalles lavées de la cuisine ; ses talons hauts la grandissaient un peu, et, quand elle marchait devant lui, les semelles de bois, se relevant vite, claquaient avec un bruit sec contre le cuir de la bottine.","As for Charles, he did not try to ask himself why he came to Les Bertaux with pleasure. Had he thought of it, he would no doubt have attributed his zeal to the seriousness of the case, or perhaps to the profit he hoped for. Was it for this, however, that his visits to the farm made a charming exception among the meager occupations of his life? On those days he got up early, set off at a gallop, pushed his horse, then he went down to wipe his feet on the grass, and put on his black gloves before entering. He liked to see himself arriving in the yard, to feel the turning gate against his shoulder, and the rooster crowing on the wall, the boys coming to meet him. He liked the barn and the stables; he loved Father Rouault; who clapped his hand calling him his saviour; he loved Mademoiselle Emma's little clogs on the washed kitchen tiles; her high heels made her look a little taller, and when she walked in front of him, the wooden soles, rising quickly, clacked with a snap against the leather of the boots.","As for Charles, he did not try to ask himself why he took such pleasure in going to Les Bertaux.

Had he thought of it, he would doubtless have attributed his zeal to the seriousness of the case, or perhaps to the fee he hoped to earn. Still, was that really why his visits to the farm formed so charming a contrast to the drabness of the rest of his life? On such days he would rise early, set off at a gallop, urge his horse; and when he was almost there he would dismount to dust his shoes on the grass, and put on his black gloves. He enjoyed the moment of arrival, the feel of the gate as it yielded against his shoulder; he enjoyed the rooster crowing on the wall, the farm boys coming to greet him. He enjoyed the barn and the stables; he enjoyed Monsieur Rouault, who would clap him in the palm of the hand and call him his “savior”; he enjoyed hearing Mademoiselle Emma’s little sabots on the newly washed flagstones of the kitchen floor.

"Quand Charles, après être monté dire adieu au père Rouault, rentra dans la salle avant de partir, il la trouva debout, le front contre la fenêtre, et qui regardait dans le jardin, où les échalas des haricots avaient été renversés par le vent.

"Alors on avait causé des dangers divers qui menaçaient l’enfance et de l’étourderie des domestiques. Madame Homais en savait quelque chose, ayant encore sur la poitrine les marques d’une écuellée de braise qu’une cuisinière, autrefois, avait laissée tomber dans son sarrau. Aussi ces bons parents prenaient-ils quantité de précautions. Les couteaux jamais n’étaient affilés, ni les appartements cirés. Il y avait aux fenêtres des grilles en fer et aux chambranles de fortes barres. Les petits Homais, malgré leur indépendance, ne pouvaient remuer sans un surveillant derrière eux ; au moindre rhume, leur père les bourrait de pectoraux, et jusqu’à plus de quatre ans ils portaient tous, impitoyablement, des bourrelets matelassés. C’était, il est vrai, une manie de madame Homais ; son époux en était intérieurement affligé, redoutant pour les organes de l’intellect les résultats possibles d’une pareille compression, et il s’échappait jusqu’à lui dire :","Then they had caused various dangers which threatened childhood and the carelessness of the servants. Madame Homais knew something about it, as she still had the marks on her chest from a bowl of embers that a cook had once dropped in her lab coat. So these good parents took many precautions. The knives were never sharpened, nor the flats waxed. There were iron gratings at the windows and strong bars at the jambs. The little Homais, despite their independence, could not move about without a supervisor behind them; at the slightest cold, their father stuffed them with pectorals, and until they were over four years old they all wore, pitilessly, padded rolls. It was, it is true, a mania of Madame Homais; her husband was inwardly afflicted by it, fearing for the organs of the intellect the possible results of such a compression, and he went so far as to say to her:","They had talked about the various dangers with which childhood was threatened, and the thoughtlessness of servants. Madame Homais knew something about this, since she still bore on her chest the marks of a bowlful of embers that a cook had, long ago, let fall into her smock. Indeed, these good parents took no end of precautions. The knives were never sharpened, nor the floors waxed. There were iron grates on the windows and stout bars across the fireplaces. The Homais children, despite their independence, could not move without someone watching them; at the slightest cold, their father would stuff them with cough syrups, and until they were past the age of four, they were all mercilessly made to wear padded caps. True, this was an obsession of Madame 			Homais’s; her husband was privately distressed by it, fearing the effects of such pressure on the organs of the intellect, and he sometimes forgot himself so far as to say to her: “Are you trying to turn them into Caribs or Botocudos?”","The conversation had then turned on the various dangers that beset children because of the absent-mindedness of servants. Madame Homais could speak from experience, bearing as she did to this day on her chest the marks of a panful of burning coals that a cook had dropped inside her pinafore when she was small. No wonder the Homais’ went out of their way to be careful with their children! In their house knives were never sharpened, floors never waxed. There were iron grills at the windows and heavy bars across the fireplaces. Though taught to be self-reliant, the Homais children couldn’t move a step without someone in attendance; at the slightest sign of a cold their father stuffed them with cough syrups, and well past their fourth birthdays they were all mercilessly made to wear padded caps. This, it must be said, was a pet idea of Madame Homais’: her husband was secretly worried about it, fearing lest the intellectual organs suffer as a result of such pressure; and he sometimes went so far as to say:"

"Pendant qu’elle le considérait, goûtant ainsi dans son irritation une sorte de volupté dépravée, Léon s’avança d’un pas. Le froid qui le pâlissait semblait déposer sur sa figure une langueur plus douce ; entre sa cravate et son cou, le col de la chemise, un peu lâche, laissait voir la peau ; un bout d’oreille dépassait sous une mèche de cheveux, et son grand œil bleu, levé vers les nuages, parut à Emma plus limpide et plus beau que ces lacs des montagnes où le ciel se mire.","While she was gazing at him, thus tasting in her irritation a sort of depraved voluptuousness, Leon took a step forward.

"Elle revint ; et alors, sans parti pris ni direction, au hasard, elle vagabonda.

De temps à autre, le cocher sur son siège jetait aux cabarets des regards désespérés. Il ne comprenait pas quelle fureur de la locomotion poussait ces individus à ne vouloir point s’arrêter. Il essayait quelquefois, et aussitôt il entendait derrière lui partir des exclamations de colère.

From time to time the coachman in his seat cast despairing glances at the cabarets. He did not understand what fury of locomotion pushed these individuals not to want to stop.

Some of his comrades brought to the convent the keepsakes they had received as gifts. They had to be hidden, that was a business; they were read in the dormitory.

"Et, tout en se moquant des comices, Rodolphe, pour circuler plus à l’aise, montrait au gendarme sa pancarte bleue, et même il s’arrêtait parfois devant quelque beau sujet, que madame Bovary n’admirait guère. Il s’en aperçut, et alors se mit à faire des plaisanteries sur les dames d’Yonville, à propos de leur toilette ; puis il s’excusa lui-même du négligé de la sienne. Elle avait cette incohérence de choses communes et recherchées, où le vulgaire, d’habitude, croit entrevoir la révélation d’une existence excentrique, les désordres du sentiment, les tyrannies de l’art, et toujours un certain mépris des conventions sociales, ce qui le séduit ou l’exaspère. Ainsi sa chemise de batiste à manchettes plissées bouffait au hasard du vent, dans l’ouverture de son gilet, qui était de coutil gris, et son pantalon à larges raies découvrait aux chevilles ses bottines de nankin, claquées de cuir verni. Elles étaient si vernies, que l’herbe s’y reflétait. Il foulait avec elles les crottins de cheval, une main dans la poche de sa veste et son chapeau de paille mis de côté.","And, while making fun of the comitia, Rodolphe, to move about more easily, showed the policeman his blue placard, and he even stopped sometimes in front of some fine subject which Madame Bovary hardly admired. He noticed this, and then began to make jokes about the ladies of Yonville, in connection with their toilet; then he apologized for the negligence of his. She had that inconsistency of common and sought-after things, where the vulgar usually think they glimpse the revelation of an eccentric existence, the disorders of sentiment, the tyrannies of art, and always a certain contempt for social conventions, which that seduces or exasperates him. Thus his cambric shirt with pleated cuffs puffed haphazardly in the wind, in the opening of his waistcoat, which was of gray drill, and his wide-striped trousers revealed his nankin boots, clad in patent leather, at the ankles. They were so varnished that the grass was reflected in them. He trampled the horse droppings with them, one hand in his jacket pocket and his straw hat put aside.","And even as he poked fun at the fair, Rodolphe showed the policeman his blue card so that they could walk about more freely, and he even stopped now and then in front of some handsome specimen, which Madame Bovary did not much admire. He noticed this and then began to make jokes about the ladies of Yonville and the way they dressed; then he asked her forgiveness for the carelessness of his own appearance. It was that incoherent mix of the ordinary and the elegant that common people generally take for evidence of an eccentric lifestyle, chaotic passions, the tyrannical dictates of art, and always a certain contempt for social conventions, which either charms or exasperates them. Thus, the breast of his cambric shirt, with its pleated cuffs, swelled as the wind caught it in the opening of his vest of gray twill, and his broad-striped trousers revealed at the ankles his low nankeen boots, vamped in patent leather. They were so highly 			polished they mirrored the grass; and in them he was trampling the horse dung underfoot, one hand in his jacket pocket and his straw hat tipped to the side.","And though he kept making fun of the show, Rodolphe displayed his blue pass to the guard so that they could walk about unmolested, and he even stopped from time to time in front of some particularly fine exhibit. It was never anything that Madame Bovary cared about: he noticed this, and began to make jokes about the Yonville ladies and the way they dressed; then he apologized for the carelessness of his own costume. This was a mixture of the casual and the refined—the kind of thing that both fascinates and exasperates the common herd, hinting as it does at an eccentric way of life, indulgence in wild passions and “artistic” affectations, and a contempt for social conventions. His batiste shirt (it had pleated cuffs) puffed out from the opening of his gray twill vest at each gust of wind; and his broad-striped trousers ended at nankeen shoes trimmed with patent leather so shiny that the grass was reflected in it. He tramped unconcernedly through horse dung, one thumb in his vest pocket, his straw hat tilted over one ear."

"La mairie se trouvant à une demi-lieue de la ferme, on s’y rendit à pied, et l’on revint de même, une fois la cérémonie faite à l’église. Le cortège, d’abord uni comme une seule écharpe de couleur, qui ondulait dans la campagne, le long de l’étroit sentier serpentant entre les blés verts, s’allongea bientôt et se coupa en groupes différents, qui s’attardaient à causer. Le ménétrier allait en tête, avec son violon empanaché de rubans à la coquille ; les mariés venaient ensuite, les parents, les amis tout au hasard, et les enfants restaient derrière, s’amusant à arracher les clochettes des brins d’avoine, ou à se jouer entre eux, sans qu’on les vît. La robe d’Emma, trop longue, traînait un peu par le bas ; de temps à autre, elle s’arrêtait pour la tirer, et alors délicatement, de ses doigts gantés, elle enlevait les herbes rudes avec les petits dards des chardons, pendant que Charles, les mains vides, attendait qu’elle eût fini. Le père Rouault, un chapeau de soie neuf sur la tête et les parements de son habit noir lui couvrant les mains jusqu’aux ongles, donnait le bras à madame Bovary mère. Quant à M. Bovary père, qui, méprisant au fond tout ce monde-là, était venu simplement avec une redingote à un rang de boutons d’une coupe militaire, il débitait des galanteries d’estaminet à une jeune paysanne blonde. Elle saluait, rougissait, ne savait que répondre. Les autres gens de la noce causaient de leurs affaires ou se faisaient des niches dans le dos, s’excitant d’avance à la gaieté ; et, en y prêtant l’oreille, on entendait toujours le crin-crin du ménétrier qui continuait à jouer dans la campagne. Quand il s’apercevait qu’on était loin derrière lui, il s’arrêtait à reprendre haleine, cirait longuement de colophane son archet, afin que les cordes grinçassent mieux, et puis il se remettait à marcher, abaissant et levant tour à tour le manche de son violon, pour se bien marquer la mesure à lui-même. Le bruit de l’instrument faisait partir de loin les petits oiseaux.","The town hall being half a league from the farm, we went there on foot, and we returned in the same way, once the ceremony was done in the church. The procession, at first united like a single colored scarf, which undulated in the countryside, along the narrow path winding between the green corn, soon lengthened and broke up into different groups, which lingered to chat. . The fiddler went in front, with his violin plumed with shell ribbons; the newlyweds came next, the parents, friends at random, and the children stayed behind, having fun pulling the bells from the oats, or playing with each other, without being seen. Emma's dress, too long, trailed a little at the bottom; from time to time she stopped to pull it, and then delicately, with her gloved fingers, she removed the rough grass with the little spur of the thistles, while Charles, empty-handed, waited until she had finished. Father Rouault, a new silk hat on his head and the facings of his black coat covering his hands to the nails, gave his arm to Madame Bovary senior. As for M. Bovary senior, who, at bottom despising everyone there, had come simply with a frock coat with one row of buttons of a military cut, he spouted gallantries from a tavern to a fair-haired young peasant girl. She bowed, blushed, did not know what to answer. The other people at the wedding were talking about their business or making fun of each other, excited in advance by gaiety; and, if you listened to it, you could always hear the horsehair of the fiddler who continued to play in the countryside. When he noticed that we were far behind him, he stopped to catch his breath, waxed his bow for a long time with rosin, so that the strings creaked better, and then he resumed walking, lowering and raising in turn the neck of his violin, to mark the time well for himself. The sound of the instrument sent the little birds away from afar.","Since the town hall was half a league from the farm, they went there on foot and came back in the same manner, after the ceremony had been performed at the church. The procession, at first united like a single colorful scarf, undulating over the countryside, along the narrow path winding between the green wheat fields, soon lengthened out and broke up into different groups that loitered to talk. The fiddler walked in front, his violin trimmed with ribbons at its scroll; then came the married couple, the relatives, the friends in no particular order; and the children lagged behind, amusing themselves tearing the bell-shaped flowers off the oat stems or playing among themselves, out of sight. Emma’s dress, too long, trailed a little at the hem; from time to time, she would stop to lift it up, and then, delicately, with her gloved fingers, she would remove the coarse grass and small spikes of thistle, while Charles, his hands empty, waited until she had 			finished. Père Rouault, a new silk hat on his head and the cuffs of his black coat covering his hands down to the nails, gave his arm to the elder Madame Bovary. As for the elder Monsieur Bovary, who, really despising all these people, had come simply in a frock coat of military cut with one row of buttons, he was delivering barroom compliments to a blond young peasant woman. She bowed her head, blushed, not knowing what to answer. The others in the wedding party talked business or played tricks behind one another’s backs, rousing their spirits in advance; and if one listened, one could always hear the scraping of the fiddler, who went on playing across the fields. When he noticed that the others were far behind him, he would stop to catch his breath, rub his bow with rosin for a long time so that the strings would squeak all the more loudly, and then begin walking again, lowering and raising the neck of his violin by turns, to mark the beat firmly for himself. 			 The noise of the instrument frightened away the little birds for a long distance around him.","Since the mayor’s office was scarcely more than a mile from the farm, the wedding party went there on foot and came back the same way after the church ceremony. The procession was compact at first, like a bright sash festooning the countryside as it followed the narrow path winding between the green grain fields; but soon it lengthened out and broke up into different groups, which lingered to gossip along the way. The fiddler went first, the scroll of his violin gay with ribbons; then came the bridal pair; then their families; then their friends in no particular order; and last of all the children, having a good time pulling the bell-shaped flowers from the oat stalks or playing among themselves out of sight of their elders. Emma’s gown was too long, and trailed a little; from time to time she stopped to pull it up; and at such moments she would carefully pick off the coarse grasses and thistle spikes with her gloved fingers, as Charles waited empty-handed beside her. Rouault, in a new silk hat, the cuffs of his black tail coat coming down over his hands as far as his fingertips, had given his arm to the older Madame Bovary. The older Monsieur Bovary, who looked on all these people with contempt, and had come wearing simply a single-breasted overcoat of military cut, was acting the barroom gallant with a blonde young peasant girl. She bobbed and blushed, tongue-tied and confused. The other members of the wedding party discussed matters of business, or played tricks behind each other’s backs, their spirits already soaring in anticipation of the fun. If they listened, they could hear the steady scraping of the fiddle in the fields. When the fiddler realized that he had left everyone far behind, he stopped for breath, carefully rubbed his bow with rosin to make his strings squeak all the better, and then set off again on his course, raising and lowering the neck of his violin to keep time. The sound of the instrument frightened away all the birds for a long distance ahead."

"Un souci meilleur vint le distraire, à savoir la grossesse de sa femme. À mesure que le terme en approchait, il la chérissait davantage. C’était un autre lien de la chair s’établissant et comme le sentiment continu d’une union plus complexe. Quand il voyait de loin sa démarche paresseuse et sa taille tourner mollement sur ses hanches sans corset, quand vis-à-vis l’un de l’autre il la contemplait tout à l’aise et qu’elle prenait, assise, des poses fatiguées dans son fauteuil, alors son bonheur ne se tenait plus ; il se levait, il l’embrassait, passait ses mains sur sa figure, l’appelait petite maman, voulait la faire danser, et débitait, moitié riant, moitié pleurant, toutes sortes de plaisanteries caressantes qui lui venaient à l’esprit. L’idée d’avoir engendré le délectait. Rien ne lui manquait à présent. Il connaissait l’existence humaine tout du long, et il s’y attablait sur les deux coudes avec sérénité.","A better concern came to distract him, namely his wife's pregnancy. As the term approached, he cherished her more. It was another bond of the flesh being established and like the continuing feeling of a more complex union. When he saw her lazy gait from afar and her waist turn limply on her hips without a corset, when opposite each other he gazed at her quite at ease and when she took, seated, poses tired in her chair, so her happiness was no longer contained; he got up, kissed her, passed his hands over her face, called her little mamma, wanted to make her dance, and spouted, half laughing, half crying, all sorts of caressing jokes that came to his mind. The idea of having fathered delighted him. Nothing was missing now. He knew human existence all along, and he propped himself up on both elbows with serenity.","A more agreeable concern came to distract him, namely, his wife’s pregnancy. As her term drew near, she became all the more dear to him. Another bond of the flesh was being established between them, and something like a pervasive sense of a more complex union. When, from a distance, he watched her indolent steps and her waist turning gently above her uncorseted hips, when, across from her, he contemplated her at his ease, as she sat tired in her armchair, his happiness could no longer be contained; he would stand up, he would kiss her, run his hands over her face, call her “little mama,” try to get her to dance, and, half laughing, half crying, babble all sorts of fond pleasantries that came into his head. The idea of having engendered a child delighted him. Nothing was lacking to him now. He knew the entire scope of human existence, and he sat down to it serenely with both elbows on the table.","He had another, happier concern—his wife’s pregnancy. As her term drew near she became ever dearer to him. Another bond of the flesh was being forged between them, one which gave him an all-pervasive feeling that their union was now closer. The indolence of her gait, the gentle sway of her uncorseted body, her tired way of sitting in a chair, all filled him with uncontrollable happiness: he would go up to her and kiss her, stroke her face, call her “little mother,” try to dance with her; and half laughing, half weeping, he would think of a thousand playful endearments to shower her with. The idea of having begotten a child enchanted him. Now he had everything he could ever hope for. He had been granted all that human life had to offer, and he was serenely ready to enjoy it."

"Elle le regardait, l’ouvrait, et même elle flairait l’odeur de sa doublure, mêlée de verveine et de tabac. À qui appartenait-il ?… Au Vicomte. C’était peut-être un cadeau de sa maîtresse. On avait brodé cela sur quelque métier de palissandre, meuble mignon que l’on cachait à tous les yeux, qui avait occupé bien des heures et où s’étaient penchées les boucles molles de la travailleuse pensive. Un souffle d’amour avait passé parmi les mailles du canevas ; chaque coup d’aiguille avait fixé là une espérance ou un souvenir, et tous ces fils de soie entrelacés n’étaient que la continuité de la même passion silencieuse. Et puis le Vicomte, un matin, l’avait emporté avec lui. De quoi avait-on parlé, lorsqu’il restait sur les cheminées à large chambranle, entre les vases de fleurs et les pendules Pompadour ? Elle était à Tostes. Lui, il était à Paris, maintenant ; là-bas ! Comment était ce Paris ? Quel nom démesuré ! Elle se le répétait à demi-voix, pour se faire plaisir ; il sonnait à ses oreilles comme un bourdon de cathédrale, il flamboyait à ses yeux jusque sur l’étiquette de ses pots de pommade.","She looked at it, opened it, and even smelled the smell of its lining, mixed with verbena and tobacco. To whom did it belong?... To the Viscount. Maybe it was a gift from his mistress. This had been embroidered on some rosewood loom, a pretty piece of furniture which was hidden from all eyes, which had occupied many hours and over which the soft curls of the pensive worker had bent. A breath of love had passed through the stitches of the canvas; each stroke of the needle had fixed there a hope or a memory, and all these intertwined threads of silk were only the continuity of the same silent passion. And then the Viscount, one morning, had taken it away with him. What had been talked about, when it rested on the wide-framed fireplaces, between the vases of flowers and the Pompadour clocks? She was at Tostes. He was in Paris now; the low ! How was this Paris? What a disproportionate name! She repeated it to herself in a low voice, to please herself; it rang in his ears like a cathedral bell, it blazed in his eyes even on the label of his pots of ointment.","She would look at it, open it, and even sniff the fragrance of its lining, a mingling of verbena and tobacco. Who did it belong to? … The vicomte. Perhaps it was a gift from his mistress. It had been embroidered on some rosewood frame, a dainty little implement kept hidden from all other eyes, the occupation of many hours, and over it had hung the soft curls of the pensive worker. A breath of love had passed among the stitches of the canvas; each stroke of the needle had fastened into it a hope or a memory, and all those interlaced threads of silk were merely an extension of the same silent passion. And then, one morning, the vicomte had taken it away with him. What had people talked about, as it lay on one of those broad mantelpieces, between the vases of flowers and the Pompadour clocks? She was at Tostes. And he—he was in Paris, now; out there! What was it like—Paris? The name itself was 			so vast! She would repeat it to herself softly, to give herself pleasure; it would resound in her ears like the great bell of a cathedral; it would blaze before her eyes even on the labels of her jars of pomade.","She would look at it, open it, even sniff its lining, fragrant with verbena and tobacco. Whose was it? The vicomte’s. A present from his mistress, perhaps. It had been embroidered on some rosewood frame, a charming little piece of furniture kept hidden from prying eyes, over which a pensive girl had bent for hours and hours, her soft curls brushing its surface. Love had breathed through the mesh of the canvas; every stroke of the needle had recorded a hope or a memory; and all these intertwined silken threads bespoke one constant, silent passion. And then one morning the vicomte had taken it away with him. What words had they exchanged as he stood leaning his elbow on one of those elaborate mantelpieces decked with vases of flowers and rococo clocks? She was in Tostes. Whereas he, now, was in Paris—in Paris! What was it like, Paris? The very name had such a vastness about it! She repeated it to herself under her breath with a thrill of pleasure; it sounded in her ears like the great bell of a cathedral; it blazed before her eyes everywhere, glamorous even on the labels of her jars of pomade."
"–Ah ! mon Dieu ! la robe, prenez garde ! s’écria madame Lefrançois. Aidez-nous donc ! disait-elle au pharmacien. Est-ce que vous avez peur, par hasard ?","– Oh! my God ! the dress, beware! exclaimed Madame Lefrancois. So help us! she said to the pharmacist. Are you scared, by any chance?","“Oh, my Lord!

"De temps à autre, relevant la tête, il lui envoyait un long regard tout plein de détresse. Une fois il soupira :","From time to time, raising his head, he gave her a long, distressed look. Once he sighed:","From time to time, lifting his head, he would give her a long look of distress. Once, he sighed:","Now and again he lifted his head and gave her a long, stricken look."
"Ce geste d’Emma pourtant n’avait été qu’un avertissement ; car M.

"Et il ne pouvait que répéter ce mot : « Empoisonnée ! empoisonnée ! » Félicité courut chez Homais, qui l’exclama sur la place ; madame Lefrançois l’entendit au Lion d’or ; quelques-uns se levèrent pour l’apprendre à leurs voisins, et toute la nuit le village fut en éveil.","And he could only repeat this word: ""Poisoned!"" poisoned!

"Souvent, on était en marche, lorsque son chapeau, d’un mouvement brusque entrait dans la diligence par le vasistas 93, tandis qu’il se cramponnait, de l’autre bras, sur le marchepied, entre l’éclaboussure des roues. Sa voix, faible d’abord et vagissante, devenait aiguë. Elle se traînait dans la nuit, comme l’indistincte lamentation d’une vague détresse ; et, à travers la sonnerie des grelots, le murmure des arbres et le ronflement de la boîte creuse, elle avait quelque chose de lointain qui bouleversait Emma. Cela lui descendait au fond de l’âme comme un tourbillon dans un abîme, et l’emportait parmi les espaces d’une mélancolie sans bornes. Mais Hivert, qui s’apercevait d’un contrepoids, allongeait à l’aveugle de grands coups avec son fouet. La mèche le cinglait sur ses plaies, et il tombait dans la boue en poussant un hurlement.","We were often in motion, when his hat, with a sudden movement, entered the stagecoach through the fanlight 93, while he clung with the other arm to the running board, between the splash of the wheels. His voice, feeble at first and wailing, became shrill. She dragged herself through the night, like the indistinct lament of a vague distress; and, through the ringing of the bells, the murmur of the trees and the hum of the hollow box, there was something distant about her that overwhelmed Emma. It descended to the bottom of his soul like a whirlwind in an abyss, and carried him away among spaces of boundless melancholy. But Hivert, perceiving a counterpoise, struck the blind man with great blows with his whip. The wick slashed at his wounds, and he fell into the mud, screaming.","Often, they would be moving steadily along when his hat would suddenly come into the coach through the little window, while he held fast with his other arm, standing on the footboard between the spattering wheels. His voice, weak at first, and wailing, would grow shrill. It would linger in the darkness, like the indistinct lamentation of some vague distress; and, heard through the ringing of the harness bells, the murmur of the trees, and the rumbling of the hollow body of the coach, it had something distant about it that would overwhelm Emma. It would descend into the depths of her soul like a whirlwind into an abyss and would carry her away into the spaces of a boundless melancholy. But Hivert, noticing the counterbalancing weight, would lash out at the blind man with long strokes of his whip. The tip would sting him on his sores, and he would drop off into the mud, howling.","Often while the coach was moving slowly up the hill his hat would suddenly come through the window, and he would be there, clinging with his other hand to the foot-board, between the spattering wheels. His voice, at the outset a mere wail, would grow shrill. It would linger in the darkness like a plaintive cry of distress; and through the jingle of the horse bells, the rustle of the trees and the rumble of the empty coach, there was something eerie about it that gave Emma a shudder of horror. The sound spiraled down into the very depths of her soul, like a whirl-wind in an abyss, and swept her off into the reaches of a boundless melancholy. But Hivert would become aware that his vehicle was weighed down on one side, and would strike out savagely at the blind man with his whip. The stinging lash would cut into his wounds, and he would drop off into the mud with a shriek."

"D’ailleurs, elle devenait bien sentimentale. Il avait fallu échanger des miniatures, on s’était coupé des poignées de cheveux, et elle demandait à présent une bague, un véritable anneau de mariage, en signe d’alliance éternelle.
