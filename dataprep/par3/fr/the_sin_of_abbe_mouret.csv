— Tu sais bien que je cherche mon arbre.,“You know I'm looking for my tree.,‘You know very well that I’m looking for my tree.’,"'No; leave me, don't worry me;' and she added in a grave tone, though she tried to feign jocularity: 'you know that I have my tree to look for.'"
"— C’est bien, restons ici… Je veux te parler. Tu ne peux être méchant. Tu me comprendras. Tu ne me laisseras pas partir seule… Non, ne te défends pas. Je ne te prendrai plus, puisque cela te fait mal. Tu vois, je suis très calme. Nous allons causer, doucement, comme lorsque nous nous perdions, et que nous ne cherchions pas notre chemin, pour causer plus longtemps.","“It’s fine, let’s stay here… I want to talk to you. You can't be mean. You will understand me. You won't let me go alone… No, don't defend yourself. I won't take you anymore, since it hurts you. You see, I'm very calm. We are going to talk, softly, as when we got lost, and we weren't looking for our way, to talk longer.","‘Very well, let’s stay here... I want to speak to you. You cannot be wicked. You cannot let me leave without you... No, don’t defend yourself. I shan’t take hold of you again since that hurts you. You see, I’m very calm. We are going to talk quietly, like the times when we lost our way and didn’t even try to find our way again so that we could go on talking.’","'Well, let us stay here, then. I wish to speak to you. You cannot, surely, be cruel. You will understand me. You will not let me go away alone. Oh! do not begin to excuse yourself. I will not lay my hands upon you again, since it distresses you. I am quite calm now as you can see. We will talk quietly, as we used to do in the old days when we lost our way, and did not hurry to find it again, that we might have the more time to talk together.'"
"— Oui, je t’aime, reprit-elle. Tu as une barbe très fine qui ne me fait pas mal, lorsque j’appuie mon front sur ton cou. Tu es fort, tu es grand, tu es beau. Je t’aime, Serge.","""Yes, I love you,"" she replied. You have a very fine beard which does not hurt me when I press my forehead against your neck. You are strong, you are tall, you are beautiful. I love you Serge.","‘Yes, and I love you,’ she said again. ‘You have a very soft beard which doesn’t hurt me when I lean my brow on your neck. You are strong, and tall, and handsome. I love you, Serge.’","Ah! yes, I love you , I love you, Albine.' 'And I love you, too,' she answered. ' You are strong, and tall, and handsome. I love you, Serge.'"
"— Ah bien, tout est brouillé, maintenant, répondit la vieille servante qui s’était empressée de mêler les cartes. Si vous croyez que je vais le mettre sous verre, votre paquet ! Et puis je pouvais gagner, j’avais encore un as.","""Ah well, everything is scrambled now,"" replied the old servant, who had hastened to shuffle the cards. If you think I'll put it under glass, your package! And then I could win, I still had an ace.","‘Ah, well it’s all muddled up now,’ replied La Teuse, who had lost no time in mixing up the cards. ‘Do you really think I’m going to preserve your hand in a glass case? Besides, I might have won, I still had an ace.’","'Oh! they are all mixed now,' answered the old servant, who had lost no time in shuffling them together. ' Did you suppose that I was going to put your hand away under a glass case? And, besides, I might very well have won, for I still had an ace left.'"
"Il restait debout, il ramassait les roses tombées du lit, qu’il jetait une à une sur les jupes d’Albine.","He remained standing, he picked up the roses that had fallen from the bed, which he threw one by one over Albine's skirts.","He was still standing, gathering up the roses that had fallen off the bed, and throwing them one by one on to Albine’s skirts.","He remained standing and began to pick up the roses that had fallen from the bed, throwing them, one by one, upon Albine's skirts."
"— Oui, oui, j’aurais dû m’en douter. C’était logique. Et avec toi ça devenait abominable. Tu n’es pas un homme comme les autres… Mais écoute, je t’assure que tu étais perdu. L’air qu’elle a mis autour de toi pouvait seul te sauver de la folie. Enfin, tu m’entends, je n’ai pas besoin de te dire où tu en étais. C’est une de mes plus belles cures. Et je n’en suis pas fier, va ! car, maintenant, voilà que la pauvre fille en meurt !","“Yes, yes, I should have known. It was logical. And with you it became abominable. You are not a man like the others... But listen, I assure you that you were lost. Only the air she put around you could save you from madness. Finally, you hear me, I do not need to tell you where you were. It is one of my most beautiful cures. And I'm not proud of it! for now the poor girl is dying of it!","‘Yes, yes, I should have guessed. It was logical. And with you, it became abominable. You are not a man like other men... But listen, let me assure you, you were done for. Only the atmosphere she created around you could have saved you from madness. So, just understand, I don’t need to tell you what sort of state you were in. It was one of my very best treatments. And yet I’m not proud of it, for now the poor girl is dying of it!’","'But yes, but yes, I ought to have guessed. It was all quite natural. Though with one in your position, it was bound to be abominable! You are not as other men. But listen to me, I assure you that otherwise you would never have recovered. It was she alone, with the atmosphere she set round you, who saved you from madness. There is no need for me to tell you what a state you were in. It is one of my most wonderful cures. But I can't take any pride, any pleasure in it, for now the poor girl is dying of it!'"
"Il avait certainement grandi. Vêtu d’un vêtement lâche, il était planté droit, un peu mince encore, les membres fins, la poitrine carrée, les épaules rondes. Son cou blanc, taché de brun à la nuque, tournait librement, renversait légèrement la tête en arrière. La santé, la force, la puissance, étaient sur sa face. Il ne souriait pas, il était au repos, avec une bouche grave et douce, des joues fermes, un nez grand, des yeux gris, très clairs, souverains. Ses longs cheveux, qui lui cachaient tout le crâne, retombaient sur ses épaules en boucles noires ; tandis que sa barbe, légère, frisait à sa lèvre et à son menton laissant voir le blanc de la peau.","He had certainly grown up. Dressed in loose clothing, he was planted straight, still a little thin, his limbs slender, his chest square, his shoulders round. Its white neck, spotted with brown at the nape of the neck, turned freely, tilting its head back slightly. Health, strength, power, were on his face. He wasn't smiling, he was at rest, with a serious, gentle mouth, firm cheeks, a large nose, gray eyes, very clear, sovereign. Her long hair, which hid her entire skull, fell over her shoulders in black curls; while his beard, light, curled at his lip and at his chin, revealing the white of the skin.","He had certainly grown taller. Dressed in loose clothing, he stood erect, still rather thin, with his delicate limbs, broad chest, and rounded shoulders. His white neck, tanned brown on the nape, moved freely and tilted his head slightly backwards. Health, strength, and power were on his face. He was not smiling; his face was in repose, with a grave and gentle mouth, firm cheeks, a large nose, and grey eyes — very clear, commanding eyes. His long hair, covering his entire skull, fell to his shoulders in black curls, while a thin beard curled at his lips and chin, showing the white of the skin beneath.","He had certainly grown taller. Clothed in a loose garment, he stood erect, still somewhat slender, with finely moulded limbs, square chest, and rounded shoulders. His head, slightly thrown back, was poised upon a flexible and snowy neck, rimmed with brown behind. Health and strength and power were on his face. He did not smile, his expression was that of repose, with grave and tender mouth, firm cheeks, large nose, and grey, clear, commanding eyes. The long locks that thickly covered his head fell upon his shoulders in jetty curls; while a slender growth of hair, through which gleamed his white skin, curled upon his upper lip and chin."
"— C’est Moumou, dit-elle. Il a des pattes comme du velours.","""It's Moumou,"" she said. He has paws like velvet.","‘This is Moumou,’ she said. ‘His paws are like velvet.’","'It's Moumou,' she said. ' His paws are like velvet.'"
"L’abbé Mouret le regarda un moment. Il enviait ce sommeil de saint roulé dans la poussière. Il voulut chasser les mouches ; mais les mouches, entêtées, revenaient, se collaient aux lèvres violettes du Frère, qui ne les sentait seulement pas. Alors, l’abbé enjamba ce grand corps. Il entra dans le Paradou.","Abbé Mouret looked at him for a moment. He envied this saint's sleep rolled in the dust. He wanted to chase away the flies; but the stubborn flies came back, stuck to the Brother's violet lips, who simply did not feel them. Then the abbot stepped over that tall body. He entered the Paradou.","Abbé Mouret gazed at him for a moment. He envied that sleep, like that of a saint rolling in the dust. He tried to drive away the flies, but the flies stubbornly returned, sticking to the mauve lips of the Brother, who did not even feel them. Then the abbé stepped over that large figure and entered the Paradou.","Abbe Mouret looked at him for a moment. He envied the slumber of that dust-wallowing saint. He wished to drive the flies away, but they persistently returned, and clung around the purple lips of the Brother, who was quite unconscious of their presence. Then the Abbe strode over his big body and entered the Paradou."
"La Teuse avait préparé le déjeuner, au fond du petit jardin, sous deux grands mûriers, dont les branches étalées mettaient là une toiture de feuillage. Le soleil, vainqueur enfin des buées orageuses du matin, chauffait les carrés de légumes, tandis que le mûrier jetait un large pan d’ombre sur la table boiteuse, où étaient servies deux tasses de lait, accompagnées d’épaisses tartines.","La Teuse had prepared breakfast, at the end of the little garden, under two large mulberry trees, whose spreading branches provided a roof of foliage. The sun, finally victorious over the stormy mist of the morning, warmed the squares of vegetables, while the mulberry tree cast a large patch of shade on the lame table, where two cups of milk were served, accompanied by thick slices of bread.","La Teuse had prepared the breakfast at the bottom of the little garden, beneath two big mulberry trees, whose branches spread out to create a roof of foliage. The sun, having at last conquered the stormy mists of the early morning, was warming the vegetable patches, while the mulberry tree cast a wide patch of shade over the rickety table, laid with two cups of milk and some thick slices of bread.","La Teuse had laid out the breakfast beneath two big mulberry trees, whose spreading branches formed a sheltering roof at the bottom of the little garden. The sun, which had at last succeeded in dissipating the stormy-looking vapours of early morning, was warming the beds of vegetables, while the mulberry-trees cast a broad shadow over the rickety table, on which were laid two cups of milk and some thick slices of bread."
"Elle les appelait, elle tirait de sa poche quelque croûte de pain. Les petits lapins se rassuraient, venaient un à un, obliquement, le nez frisé, se mettant debout contre le grillage. Et elle les laissait là, un instant, pour montrer à son frère le duvet rose de leur ventre. Puis, elle donnait la croûte au plus hardi. Alors, toute la bande accourait, se coulait, se serrait, sans se battre ; trois petits, parfois, mordaient à la même croûte ; d’autres se sauvaient, se tournaient contre le mur, pour manger tranquilles ; tandis que les mères, au fond, continuaient à souffler, méfiantes, refusant les croûtes.","She called them, she took a crust of bread from her pocket. The little rabbits were reassured, came one by one, obliquely, their noses curled, standing up against the fence. And she left them there for a moment to show her brother the pink down of their bellies. Then, she gave the crust to the most daring. Then the whole gang ran up, slipped away, huddled together, without a fight; three little ones, sometimes, bit into the same crust; others ran away, turned against the wall, to eat in peace; while the mothers, in the background, continued to blow, wary, refusing the scabs.","She called out to them, taking some bread out of her pocket. The little rabbits, reassured, came along, one by one, with their noses puckered up, and stood up against the wire netting. She left them like that for a moment or so, so her brother could see the pink down of their bellies. Then she gave the bread to the boldest one. At this, the whole lot rushed up, sliding forward, pressed together but without fighting; at times there were three little ones all nibbling on the same crust; others moved away, turning to the wall to be able to eat in peace; meanwhile their mothers stayed back, still huffing and puffing, distrustful and refusing the bread.","She called them and drew some bread-crust from her pocket. The little rabbits then became more confident, and, with puckered noses, kept sidling up, and rearing against the netting one by one. She kept them like that for a minute to show her brother the rosy down upon their bellies, and then gave her crust to the boldest one. Upon this the whole of them flocked up, sliding forward and squeezing one another, but never quarreling. At one moment three little ones were all nibbling the same piece of crust, but others darted away, turning to the wall so as to eat in peace, while their mothers in the rear remained snuffing distrustfully and refused the crusts."
Mais il se reprit.,But he pulled himself together.,But then he corrected himself:,he asked.
"La vieille servante regardait un des cierges d’un air inquiet. Sa préoccupation parut redoubler, pendant que le prêtre, incliné profondément, les mains jointes de nouveau, récitait le Confiteor. Elle s’arrêta, se frappant à son tour la poitrine, la tête penchée, continuant à guetter le cierge. La voix grave du prêtre et les balbutiements du servant alternèrent encore pendant un instant.","The old servant looked at one of the candles with a worried air. His preoccupation seemed to redouble, while the priest, bowing deeply, his hands clasped again, recited the Confiteor. She stopped, beating her chest in turn, her head bowed, continuing to watch for the candle. The priest's deep voice and the servant's stammering alternated for another moment.","The old servant was gazing rather anxiously at one of the candles. Her concern seemed to increase further when the priest, bending low, with his hands again joined together, recited the Confiteor. She stood still, and she too beat her breast, and with bowed head, went on watching the candle. The priest’s grave voice and the stammering of the server continued to alternate for a moment or so:","The old servant was gazing at one of the candles with a troubled look. Her anxiety seemed to increase while the priest, bowing down with hands joined again, recited the Confiteor. She stood still, in her turn struck her breast, her head bowed, but still keeping a watchful eye on the taper. For another minute the priest's grave voice and the server's stammers alternated:"
"Devant les deux larges fenêtres, des rideaux de calicot, soigneusement tirés, éclairaient la chambre de la blancheur tamisée du petit jour. Elle était haute de plafond, très vaste, meublée d’un ancien meuble Louis XV, à bois peint en blanc, à fleurs rouges sur un semis de feuillage. Dans le trumeau, au-dessus des portes, aux deux côtés de l’alcôve, des peintures laissaient encore voir les ventres et les derrières roses de petits Amours volant par bandes, jouant à deux jeux qu’on ne distinguait plus, tandis que les boiseries des murs, ménageant des panneaux ovales, les portes à double battant, le plafond arrondi, jadis à fond bleu de ciel, avec des encadrements de cartouches, de médaillons, de nœuds de rubans couleur chair, s’effaçaient, d’un gris très doux, un gris qui gardait l’attendrissement de ce paradis fané. En face des fenêtres, la grande alcôve, s’ouvrant sous des enroulements de nuages, que des Amours de plâtre écartaient, penchés, culbutés, comme pour regarder effrontément le lit, était fermée, ainsi que les fenêtres, par des rideaux de calicot, cousus à gros points, d’une innocence singulière au milieu de cette pièce restée toute tiède d’une lointaine odeur de volupté.","In front of the two large windows, carefully drawn calico curtains lit the room with the subdued whiteness of dawn. It had a high ceiling, very spacious, furnished with an old Louis XV piece of furniture, with wood painted white, with red flowers on a scattering of foliage. In the trumeau, above the doors, on both sides of the alcove, paintings still showed the bellies and pink behinds of little Cupids flying in bands, playing two games that could no longer be distinguished, while the woodwork on the walls, sparing oval panels, the double leaf doors, the rounded ceiling, formerly with a sky blue background, with frames of cartouches, medallions, knots of flesh-colored ribbons, faded, a gray very soft, a gray that kept the tenderness of this faded paradise. Opposite the windows, the large alcove, opening under rolling clouds, which plaster Cupids pushed aside, leaning, tumbling over, as if to gaze brazenly at the bed, was closed, like the windows, by calico curtains, sewn with large stitches, with a singular innocence in the middle of this room which remained quite warm with a distant odor of voluptuousness.","Across the two wide windows, carefully drawn calico curtains filtered the white light of early dawn into the room. It was a very big room with a high ceiling, furnished with antique Louis XV furniture of painted white wood, and decorated with red flowers on a background of foliage. In the panels above the doors, on both sides of the alcove, paintings still showed the pink bellies and bottoms of little cupids flying about in groups, and playing games now impossible to make out. The woodwork on the walls with its oval panels, the double doors, and the rounded ceiling, once painted sky blue, and holding framed scrolls, medallions, and bows of flesh-coloured ribbon, had all paled into a very soft grey, a grey that preserved the tender melancholy of this faded paradise. Facing the windows, the large alcove opened out under banks of clouds that were being pulled aside by plaster cupids, leaning over and tumbling about, as if in a brazen effort to look at the bed; the alcove was closed, like the windows, by roughly sewn calico curtains of a surprising innocence in this room still warm with a distant scent of sensual pleasure.","Through calico curtains, carefully drawn across the two large windows, a pale white light like that of breaking day filtered into the room. It was a lofty and spacious room, fitted up with old Louis XV. furniture, the woodwork painted white, the upholstery showing a pattern of red flowers on a leafy ground. On the piers above the doors on either side of the alcove were faded paintings still displaying the rosy flesh of flying Cupids, whose games it was now impossible to follow. The wainscoting with oval panels, the folding doors, the rounded ceiling (once sky-blue and framed with scrolls, medallions, and bows of flesh-coloured ribbons), had all faded to the softest grey. Opposite the windows the large alcove opened beneath banks of clouds which plaster Cupids drew aside, leaning over, and peeping saucily towards the bed. And like the windows, the alcove was curtained with coarsely hemmed calico, whose simplicity seemed strange in this room where lingered a perfume of whilom luxury and voluptuousness."
"Cela les amusa extrêmement. Ils jouèrent aux amoureux, avec une puérilité de gamins. Ils bégayaient la passion qui avait jadis agonisé là. Ils l’apprenaient comme une leçon qu’ils ânonnaient d’une adorable manière, ne sachant point se baiser aux lèvres, cherchant sur les joues, finissant par danser l’un devant l’autre, en riant aux éclats, par ignorance de se témoigner autrement le plaisir qu’ils goûtaient à s’aimer.","This amused them immensely. They played lovers, with the puerility of children. They stammered the passion that had once agonized there. They learned it like a lesson which they mumbled in an adorable way, not knowing how to kiss each other on the lips, searching each other's cheeks, ending up dancing one in front of the other, laughing out loud, out of ignorance of each other. show otherwise the pleasure they tasted in loving each other.","This greatly amused them. They played at being lovers, with childish delight. They stammered out the passion that had once suffered and died in that room. They learned it like a lesson that they stumbled through in an adorable way, not knowing to kiss on the lips, but seeking out cheeks instead, and finally dancing up and down in front of each other, roaring with laughter, not knowing any other way of showing the pleasure they felt in loving each other.","This amused them extremely. They played at being lovers with childish glee. In stammering accents they would have revived the passion which had once throbbed and died there. But it was like a first effort at learning a lesson. They knew not how to kiss each other's lips, but sought each other's cheeks, and ended by dancing around each other, with shrieks of laughter, from ignorance of any other way of showing the pleasure they experienced from their mutual love."
"Il la conduisit par le bout des doigts, car elle tressaillait, lorsqu’il lui touchait seulement le poignet. Le bois d’arbres verts où elle s’assit était fait d’un beau cèdre, qui élargissait à plus de dix mètres les toits plats de ses branches. Puis, en arrière, poussaient les essences bizarres des conifères ; les cupressus au feuillage mou et plat comme une épaisse guipure ; les abies, droits et graves, pareils à d’anciennes pierres sacrées, noires encore du sang des victimes ; les taxus[34], dont les robes sombres se frangeaient d’argent ; toutes les plantes à feuillage persistant, d’une végétation trapue, à la verdure foncée de cuir verni, éclaboussée de jaune et de rouge, si puissante, que le soleil glissait sur elle sans l’assouplir. Un araucaria surtout était étrange, avec ses grands bras réguliers, qui ressemblaient à une architecture de reptiles, entés les uns sur les autres, hérissant leurs feuilles imbriquées comme des écailles de serpents en colère. Là, sous ces ombrages lourds, la chaleur avait un sommeil voluptueux. L’air dormait, sans un souffle, dans une moiteur d’alcôve. Un parfum d’amour oriental, le parfum des lèvres peintes de la Sunamite[35], s’exhalait des bois odorants.","He led her by the tips of his fingers, for she trembled when he even touched her wrist. The wood of green trees where she sat was made of a beautiful cedar, which spread the flat roofs of its branches to more than ten meters. Then, behind, grew the bizarre species of conifers; the cupressus with their soft, flat leaves like thick guipure; the abies, straight and grave, like ancient sacred stones, still black with the blood of the victims; the taxus[34], whose dark robes were fringed with silver; all evergreens, stocky vegetation, dark patent leather greenery, splashed with yellow and red, so powerful the sun slid over it without softening it. An araucaria especially was strange, with its long regular arms, which resembled the architecture of reptiles, grafted on top of each other, their interlocking leaves bristling like the scales of angry serpents. There, under this heavy shade, the heat had a voluptuous sleep. The air slept, without a breath, in the dampness of an alcove. A perfume of oriental love, the perfume of the painted lips of the Shunammite[35], exhaled from the fragrant woods.","He guided her by the fingertips, for she trembled if he so much as touched her wrist. The wood of green trees, where she sat down, was made up of a lovely cedar that spread out the flat roofs of its branches more than ten feet. Then further back were some unusual varieties of conifers; cypress with its soft, flat foliage, like a thick band of lace; fir trees, straight and solemn, like ancient sacred stones still black with the blood of sacrificial victims; yews, whose sombre robes were fringed with silver; and all the evergreen trees, with their thickset foliage, their dark leaves of polished leather, leaves splashed with yellow and red, and so strong that the sun slid over them without ever softening them. A monkey-puzzle tree was especially strange, with its wide regular arms like an architectural construction made of reptiles grafted one on another, with overlapping leaves bristling like the scales of angry serpents. Here, under the heavy shade, the heat seemed to sleep voluptuously. The very air was asleep, without the slightest breeze, in the warm closeness of an alcove. An Oriental love perfume, the perfume of the painted lips of the Shulamite,* was exhaled by the odorous woods.","He led her gently along by her finger-tips, for she shivered and trembled when he but touched her wrist. It was beneath a fine cedar, whose level roof-like branches spread nearly a dozen yards around, that she seated herself. Behind grew various quaint conifers; cypresses, with soft flat foliage that looked like heavy lace; spruce firs, erect and solemn, like ancient druidical pillars, still black with the blood of sacrificed victims; yews, whose dark robes were fringed with silver; evergreen trees of all kinds, with thick-set foliage, dark leathery verdure, splashed here and there with yellow and red. There was a weird-looking araucaria that stood out strangely with large regular arms resembling reptiles grafted one on the other, and bristling with imbricated leaves that suggested the scales of an excited serpent. In this heavy shade, the warm air lulled one to voluptuous drowsiness. The atmosphere slept, breathless; and a perfume of Eastern love, the perfume that came from the painted lips of the Shunamite, was exhaled by the odorous trees."
"Il mit un quart d’heure pour faire les cinq pas. À chaque effort, il s’arrêtait comme s’il lui avait fallu arracher les racines qui le tenaient au sol. La jeune fille, qui le poussait, lui dit encore en riant :","He took a quarter of an hour to take the five steps. With each effort, he stopped as if he had to tear out the roots that held him to the ground. The young girl, who was pushing him, said to him again, laughing:","It took him a quarter of an hour to take the five steps. At each effort, he would stop, as if he had had to pull up roots that were holding him to the ground. The girl, who was pushing him along, said with a laugh:","It took him a quarter of an hour to make those five steps. After each effort he stopped as if he had been obliged to tear up roots that held him to the ground. The girl, pushing him along, said with a laugh: 'You look just like a walking tree.'"
"Alors, de très loin, le prêtre entendit un murmure monter de la vallée des Artaud. Autrefois, il ne comprenait pas l’ardent langage de ces terres brûlées, où ne se tordaient que des pieds de vignes noueux, des amandiers décharnés, de vieux oliviers se déhanchant sur leurs membres infirmes. Il passait au milieu de cette passion, avec les sérénités de son ignorance. Mais, aujourd’hui, instruit dans la chair, il saisissait jusqu’aux moindres soupirs des feuilles pâmées sous le soleil. Ce furent d’abord, au fond de l’horizon, les collines, chaudes encore de l’adieu du couchant, qui tressaillirent et qui parurent s’ébranler avec le piétinement sourd d’une armée en marche. Puis, les roches éparses, les pierres des chemins, tous les cailloux de la vallée, se levèrent, eux aussi, roulant, ronflant, comme jetés en avant par le besoin de se mouvoir. À leur suite, les mares de terre rouge, les rares champs conquis à coups de pioche, se mirent à couler et à gronder, ainsi que des rivières échappées, charriant dans le flot de leur sang des conceptions de semences, des éclosions de racines, des copulations de plantes. Et bientôt tout fut en mouvement ; les souches des vignes rampaient comme de grands insectes ; les blés maigres, les herbes séchées, faisaient des bataillons armés de hautes lances ; les arbres s’échevelaient à courir, étiraient leurs membres, pareils à des lutteurs qui s’apprêtent au combat ; les feuilles tombées marchaient, la poussière des routes marchait. Multitude recrutant à chaque pas des forces nouvelles, peuple en rut dont le souffle approchait, tempête de vie à l’haleine de fournaise, emportant tout devant elle, dans le tourbillon d’un accouchement colossal. Brusquement, l’attaque eut lieu. Du bout de l’horizon, la campagne entière se rua sur l’église, les collines, les cailloux, les terres, les arbres. L’église, sous ce premier choc, craqua. Les murs se fendirent, des tuiles s’envolèrent. Mais le grand Christ, secoué, ne tomba pas.","Then, from very far away, the priest heard a murmur rising from the valley of Artaud. In the past, he did not understand the ardent language of these scorched lands, where nothing twisted but gnarled vines, emaciated almond trees, old olive trees swaying on their infirm limbs. He passed through the midst of this passion, with the serenity of his ignorance. But today, educated in the flesh, he seized even the slightest sighs of the leaves swooning under the sun. It was first, at the bottom of the horizon, the hills, still warm from the farewell of the setting sun, which quivered and seemed to shake with the dull stamping of an army on the march. Then the scattered rocks, the stones of the paths, all the pebbles of the valley, also rose up, rolling, humming, as if thrown forward by the need to move. Following them, the pools of red earth, the rare fields conquered with pickaxes, began to flow and roar, like escaping rivers, carrying in their flow of blood conceptions of seeds, blossoming of roots, plant copulations. And soon everything was in motion; the stumps of the vines crawled like great insects; lean wheat, dried herbs, formed battalions armed with high spears; the trees were running wild, stretching their limbs, like wrestlers getting ready for battle; the fallen leaves walked, the dust of the roads walked. Multitude recruiting new forces at every step, people in heat whose breath was approaching, storm of life with the breath of furnace, carrying everything before it, in the whirlwind of a colossal birth. Suddenly the attack took place. From the end of the horizon, the whole countryside rushed towards the church, the hills, the pebbles, the land, the trees. The church, under this first shock, cracked. The walls split, tiles flew away. But the great Christ, shaken, did not fall.","Then from very far away, the priest heard a murmur rising from the valley of Les Artaud. He had previously had no understanding of the ardent language of these sun-scorched lands, in which the only movements were the twisting of knotty vine-stocks, gaunt almond trees, or old olive trees, stretching awkwardly on their infirm limbs. He had moved through all that passion in the serenity of his ignorance. But today, with his new fleshly knowledge, he could grasp even the slightest sighs of leaves swooning in the sun. At first, on the far horizon, it was the hills, still warm from the farewell of the setting sun, that shuddered and seemed to shake with the muffled tramping of an army on the march. Then the scattered rocks, the stones on the roads, and all the pebbles in the valley, they too rose up, rolling and clattering as if jerked forward by the need to move. And after them, the stretches of red earth, the few fields hard won by the pick, all began to flow and growl, like rivers bursting their banks, carrying, in the waves of their blood, conceptions and new seeds, bursting new roots, and the copulation of plants. And soon everything was moving: vine stocks crawled about like huge insects; thin stalks of wheat and dried-up grasses formed battalions, armed with tall lances; trees shook off their leaves as they ran, and stretched their limbs like wrestlers preparing for combat; the fallen leaves were on the march, the very dust on the roads was marching. It was a multitude, recruiting new forces with every step, a whole nation in rut, its breathing getting nearer, a tempest of life whose breath was like a furnace, carrying everything before it in a whirlwind of colossal birth pangs. Suddenly the attack began. From the far horizon, the whole countryside rushed upon the church: hills and stones, earth and trees. Under the first shock, the church cracked. The walls split, tiles flew off the roof. But the big Christ, though shaken, did not fall.","Then, in the far distance, the priest heard a gentle murmur rising from the valley of Les Artaud. The time had been when he had not understood the impassioned language of those burning lands, where writhed but knotted vine-stocks, withered almond-trees, and decrepit olives sprawling with crippled limbs. Protected by his ignorance, he had passed undisturbed through all that world of passion. But, to-day, his ear detected the slightest sigh of the leaves that lay panting in the heat. Afar off, on the edge of the horizon, the hills, still hot with the sinking luminary's farewell, seemed to set themselves in motion with the tramp of an army on the march. Nearer at hand, the scattered rocks, the stones along the road, all the pebbles in the valley, throbbed and rolled as if possessed by a craving for motion. Then the tracts of ruddy soil, the few fields that had been reduced to cultivation, seemed to heave and growl like rivers that had burst their banks, bearing along in a blood-like flood the engenderings of seeds, the births of roots, the embraces of plants. Soon everything was in motion. The vine-branches appeared to crawl along like huge insects; the parched corn and the dry grass formed into dense, lance-waving battalions; the trees stretched out their boughs like wrestlers making ready for a contest; the fallen leaves skipped forward; the very dust on the road rolled on. It was a moving multitude reinforced by fresh recruits at every step; a legion, the sound of whose coming went on in front of it; an outburst of passionate life, sweeping everything along in a mighty whirlwind of fruitfulness. And all at once the assault began. From the limits of the horizon, the whole countryside, the hills and stones and fields and trees, rushed upon the church. At the first shock, the building quivered and cracked. The walls were pierced and the tiles on the roof were thrown down. But the great Christ, although shaken, did not fall."
"L’abbé Mouret se leva. Il fit ce geste large de Jeanbernat, ce geste de négation embrassant tout l’horizon.","Father Mouret rose. He made that sweeping gesture of Jeanbernat, that gesture of negation embracing the whole horizon.","Abbé Mouret stood up and made that sweeping gesture Jeanbernat had made, that gesture of denial, that took in the whole horizon.","Abbe Mouret rose. He made that sweeping gesture of Jeanbernat's, that wide gesture of negation, that took in everything as far as the horizon."
"— Non, dit le prêtre, j’ai promis. Ces braves gens pourraient se blesser… Restez, vous. Finissez la partie, en m’attendant.","""No,"" said the priest, ""I promised."" These good people could hurt themselves… Stay, you. Finish the game, while waiting for me.","‘No,’ said the priest, ‘I promised. Those good people might feel hurt... You stay here, and finish the game while you wait for me.’","'No,' said the priest, 'I promised to go. Those good people might feel hurt if I didn't. You stay here and play your game out while you are waiting for me.'"

"Il s’était relevé avec lenteur, serrant les poings du Frère, se méfiant d’un mauvais coup. Et il s’éloigna, sans tourner la tête, en reprenant son pas dur et allongé.","He got up slowly, clenching the Brother's fists, suspicious of a bad blow. And he walked away, without turning his head, resuming his hard, long step.","He had got up slowly, gripping the Brother’s fists, on the watch for some dirty trick. And he went away without turning his head, with the same long, hard strides.","He got up slowly, keeping a firm grasp of the Brother's wrists, to guard against any treacherous attack.

"— Eh ! réponds, accuse-moi, dis que c’est moi qui suis allée te tenter. Ce sera le comble… Va, je te permets de t’excuser. Tu peux me battre, je préférerais tes coups à ta raideur de cadavre.

"Il ne comprit pas, il lui peignit l’enfer, où brûlent les vilaines femmes. Puis, il la quitta, ayant fait son devoir, repris par cette sérénité qui lui permettait de passer sans un trouble au milieu des ordures de la chair.","He did not understand, he painted hell for her, where ugly women burn. Then he left her, having done his duty, recaptured by that serenity which allowed him to pass without a disturbance in the midst of the filth of the flesh.","He did not understand.

Then he left her, having done his duty, wrapped once more in the serenity that allowed him to move without a tremor even through all the filthiness of the flesh.","And then, as she impudently smiled at him, he pictured hell, where wicked women burn in torment.

"— Oh ! Comme vous voudrez, reprit railleusement Jeanbernat. Nous recommencerons ensemble, si cela peut vous faire plaisir… Seulement, je vous préviens que je suis très fort. Il y a là-haut, dans une chambre, quelques milliers de volumes sauvés de l’incendie du Paradou, tous les philosophes du dix-huitième siècle, un tas de bouquins sur la religion. J’en ai appris de belles, là-dedans. Depuis vingt ans, je lis ça… Ah ! Dame, vous trouverez à qui parler, monsieur le curé.","- Oh ! As you wish, resumed Jeanbernat mockingly. We will start again together, if it can make you happy… Only, I warn you that I am very strong. Up there, in a room, are a few thousand volumes saved from the Paradou fire, all the philosophers of the eighteenth century, a heap of books on religion. I learned some great things there. I have been reading this for twenty years… Ah! Lady, you will find someone to talk to, Monsieur le Cure.","‘Oh, just as you wish,’ Jeanbernat went on mockingly. ‘We two can take it up all over again, if you like, but I warn you, I’m very good at it.

I’ve been reading those books for twenty years... Ah, my word! You’ll find I can more than hold my own, Monsieur le Curé.’","'Oh! just as you please,' mockingly replied Jeanbernat. ' We'll begin together all over again, if it's any pleasure to you. But I warn you that I'm a tough hand at it.

"L’abbé Mouret ne répondit pas. La nuit était superbe, toute bleue d’un clair de lune qui changeait au loin la vallée en un lac dormant. Et il ralentissait sa marche, comme baigné d’un bien-être par ces clartés douces ; il s’arrêtait même devant certaines nappes de lumière, avec le frisson délicieux que donne l’approche d’une eau fraîche. Le Frère continuait ses grandes enjambées, le gourmandant, l’appelant.","Father Mouret did not answer. The night was superb, all blue with moonlight that changed the valley in the distance into a sleeping lake.

The Brother continued his long strides, scolding him, calling him.","Abbé Mouret did not answer. It was a superb night, quite blue with a moonlight that turned the valley in the distance into a sleeping lake.

The Brother carried on, with his long strides, scolding him and calling him on:","Abbe Mouret made no reply. It was a lovely night and all looked bluish in the moonlight, which lent to the distant part of the valley the aspect of a sleeping lake.

But the Brother continued striding along, grumbling and calling him."
"— Regarde, ceux-ci jettent des fleurs. Sous les fleurs, on ne voit plus que trois jambes nues. Je crois me souvenir qu’en arrivant ici, j’ai pu distinguer encore une dame couchée.

"Et elle le poussa ainsi de buisson en buisson, elle le reconduisit à la brèche, au milieu des arbres graves. Et là, comme Serge hésitait, le front bas, elle lui cria violemment :","And she pushed him thus from bush to bush, she led him back to the gap, in the middle of the grave trees.

"— Attends encore, disait Albine. Le parfum des roses est trop fort pour toi.

"Et il sautait sur l’étroit tapis, se débarbouillait, faisait son lit, balayait sa chambre, renouvelait l’eau de son cruchon. Ce petit ménage était une joie, dans le frisson matinal qui lui courait sur la peau. Il entendait les pierrots des platanes de la cour se lever en même temps que lui, au milieu d’un tapage d’ailes et de gosiers assourdissant. Il pensait qu’ils disaient leurs prières, à leur façon. Lui, descendait dans la salle des Méditations, où, après les oraisons, il restait une demi-heure agenouillé, à méditer sur cette pensée d’Ignace : « Que sert à l’homme de conquérir l’univers, s’il perd son âme ? » C’était un sujet fertile en bonnes résolutions, qui le faisait renoncer à tous les biens de la terre, avec le rêve si souvent caressé d’une vie au désert, sous la seule richesse d’un grand ciel bleu. Au bout de dix minutes, ses genoux, meurtris sur la dalle, devenaient tellement douloureux, qu’il éprouvait peu à peu un évanouissement de tout son être, une extase dans laquelle ils se voyait grand conquérant, maître d’un empire immense, jetant sa couronne, brisant son sceptre, foulant aux pieds un luxe inouï, des cassettes d’or, des ruissellements de bijoux, des étoffes cousues de pierreries, pour aller s’ensevelir au fond d’une Thébaïde, vêtu d’une bure qui lui écorchait l’échine. Mais la messe le tirait de ces imaginations, dont il sortait comme d’une belle histoire réelle, qui lui serait arrivée en des temps anciens. Il communiait, il chantait le psaume du jour, très ardemment, sans entendre aucune autre voix que sa voix, d’une pureté de cristal, si claire, qu’il la sentait s’envoler jusqu’aux oreilles du Seigneur. Et lorsqu’il remontait à sa chambre, il ne gravissait qu’une marche à la fois, ainsi que le recommandent saint Bonaventure et saint Thomas d’Aquin ; il marchait lentement, l’air recueilli, la tête légèrement penchée, trouvant à suivre les moindres prescriptions une jouissance indicible. Ensuite, venait le déjeuner. Au réfectoire, les croûtons de pain, alignés le long des verres de vin blanc, l’enchantaient ; car il avait bon appétit, il était d’humeur gaie, il disait par exemple que le vin était bon chrétien, allusion très audacieuse à l’eau qu’on accusait l’économe de mettre dans les bouteilles. Cela ne l’empêchait pas de retrouver son air grave pour entrer en classe. Il prenait des notes sur ses genoux, tandis que le professeur, les poignets au bord de la chaire, parlait un latin usuel, coupé parfois d’un mot français, quand il ne trouvait pas mieux. Une discussion s’élevait ; les élèves argumentaient en un jargon étrange, sans rire. Puis, c’était, à dix heures, une lecture de l’Écriture sainte, pendant vingt minutes. Il allait chercher le livre sacré, relié richement, doré sur tranche. Il le baisait avec une vénération particulière, le lisait tête nue, en saluant chaque fois qu’il rencontrait les noms de Jésus, de Marie ou de Joseph. La seconde méditation le trouvait alors tout préparé à supporter, pour l’amour de Dieu, un nouvel agenouillement, plus long que le premier. Il évitait de s’asseoir une seule seconde sur ses talons ; il goûtait cet examen de conscience de trois quarts d’heure, s’efforçant de découvrir en lui des péchés, arrivant à se croire damné pour avoir oublié la veille au soir de baiser les deux images de son scapulaire, ou pour s’être endormi sur le côté gauche ; fautes abominables, qu’il aurait voulu racheter en usant jusqu’au soir ses genoux, fautes heureuses qui l’occupaient, sans lesquelles il n’aurait su de quoi entretenir son cœur candide, endormi par la blanche vie qu’il menait. Il entrait au réfectoire tout soulagé, comme s’il était débarrassé la poitrine d’un grand crime. Les séminaristes de service, les manches de la soutane retroussées, un tablier de coutil bleu noué à la ceinture, apportaient le potage au vermicelle, le bouilli coupé par petits carrés, les portions de gigot aux haricots. Il y avait des bruits terribles de mâchoires, un silence glouton, un acharnement de fourchettes seulement interrompu par des coups d’œil envieux jetés sur la table en fer à cheval, où les directeurs mangeaient des viandes plus tendres, buvaient des vins plus rouges ; pendant que la voix empâtée de quelque fils de paysan, aux poumons solides, ânonnait sans points ni virgules, au-dessus de cette rage d’appétit, quelque lecture pieuse, des lettres de missionnaires, des mandements d’évêques, des articles de journaux religieux. Lui, écoutait, entre deux bouchées. Ces bouts de polémiques, ces récits de voyages lointains le surprenaient, l’effrayaient même, en lui révélant, au delà des murailles du séminaire, une agitation, un immense horizon, auxquels il ne pensait jamais. On mangeait encore, qu’un coup de claquoir annonçait la récréation. La cour était sablée, plantée de huit gros platanes qui, l’été, jetaient une ombre fraîche ; au midi, il y avait une muraille, haute de cinq mètres, hérissée de culs de bouteille, au-dessus de laquelle on ne voyait de Plassans que l’extrémité du clocher de Saint-Marc, une courte aiguille de pierre, dans le ciel bleu. D’un bout de la cour à l’autre, lentement, il se promenait avec un groupe de camarades, sur une seule ligne ; et chaque fois qu’il revenait, le visage vers la muraille, il regardait le clocher, qui était pour lui toute la ville, toute la terre, sous le vol libre des nuages.","And he jumped on the narrow rug, washed his face, made his bed, swept his room, renewed the water in his pitcher. This little household was a joy, in the morning shiver that ran over her skin. He heard the pierrots of the plane trees in the courtyard rising at the same time as him, amid a deafening din of wings and throats. He thought they said their prayers, in their own way. He would go down to the Meditations room, where, after the prayers, he would remain on his knees for half an hour, meditating on this thought of Ignatius: ""What is the use of man to conquer the universe if he loses his soul ? It was a subject fertile in good resolutions, which made him renounce all the goods of the earth, with the dream so often cherished of a life in the desert, under the only richness of a great blue sky. At the end of ten minutes, his knees, bruised on the slab, became so painful that he gradually experienced a fainting of his whole being, an ecstasy in which he saw himself as a great conqueror, master of an immense empire, throwing his crown, breaking his scepter, trampling underfoot an unheard-of luxury, caskets of gold, streams of jewels, fabrics sewn with jewels, to go and bury himself in the depths of a Thebaid, dressed in a homespun that suits him. grazed the spine. But the mass drew him from these imaginations, from which he emerged as from a beautiful real story, which had happened to him in ancient times. He was taking communion, he was singing the psalm of the day, very ardently, without hearing any voice other than his voice, of crystal purity, so clear that he felt it fly up to the ears of the Lord. And when he went back up to his room, he climbed only one step at a time, as Saint Bonaventure and Saint Thomas Aquinas recommend; he walked slowly, with a collected air, his head bent slightly, finding in following the slightest instructions an indescribable pleasure. Then came lunch. In the refectory, the croutons of bread, lined up along the glasses of white wine, enchanted him; for he had a good appetite, he was in a cheerful mood, he used to say, for example, that wine was good for Christians, a very audacious allusion to the water which the Bursar was accused of putting in the bottles. This did not prevent him from regaining his serious air to enter class. He was taking notes on his knees, while the professor, his wrists on the edge of the pulpit, spoke usual Latin, sometimes interrupted with a French word, when he couldn't think of anything better. A discussion arose; the students argued in strange jargon, without laughing. Then, at ten o'clock, there was a reading of Holy Scripture for twenty minutes. He was going to fetch the sacred book, richly bound, gilded on the edge. He kissed it with particular veneration, read it bareheaded, saluting each time he encountered the names of Jesus, Mary or Joseph. The second meditation then found him fully prepared to endure, for the love of God, a new kneeling, longer than the first. He avoided sitting on his heels for a single second; he relished this three-quarters of an hour examination of conscience, forcing himself to discover sins within himself, coming to believe himself damned for having forgotten the evening before to kiss the two images of his scapular, or for having fallen asleep on the left side ; abominable faults, which he would have liked to redeem by wearing out his knees until evening, happy faults which occupied him, without which he would not have known what to sustain his candid heart, asleep by the white life he was leading. He entered the refectory quite relieved, as if he had rid his chest of a great crime. The seminarians on duty, cassock sleeves rolled up, blue duck aprons tied at the waist, brought the soup with vermicelli, the boiled meat cut into small squares, the portions of lamb with beans. There were terrible clangs of jaws, a gluttonous silence, a fury of forks interrupted only by envious glances cast at the horseshoe table, where the directors ate more tender meats, drank redder wines; while the heavy voice of some peasant son, with strong lungs, mumbled without periods or commas, above this rage of appetite, some pious reading, letters from missionaries, letters from bishops, articles from newspapers religious. He was listening, between mouthfuls. These bits of controversy, these accounts of distant travels surprised him, even frightened him, by revealing to him, beyond the walls of the seminary, an agitation, an immense horizon, of which he never thought. We were still eating, when a clap announced recess. The courtyard was sanded, planted with eight large plane trees which, in summer, cast a cool shade; to the south, there was a wall, five meters high, bristling with bottle bottoms, above which nothing could be seen of Plassans but the end of the steeple of Saint-Marc, a short needle of stone, in the sky. blue. From one end of the yard to the other, slowly, he walked with a group of comrades, in a single line; and each time he came back, his face towards the wall, he looked at the steeple, which was for him the whole city, the whole earth, under the free flight of the clouds.","Then he leaped on to his narrow mat, washed, made his bed, swept his room, and put fresh water in his jug. This bit of housework was a joy for him, with the chill of morning upon his skin. He could hear the sparrows in the plane trees in the yard outside getting up at the same time, with a noisy fluttering of wings and deafening chirping. It was their way of saying their prayers, he thought. He then went down to the Meditation room, where, after his prayers, he spent half an hour on his knees, considering this thought of Saint Ignatius: * ‘What use is it for a man to conquer the universe if he loses his soul?’ * This subject was a fertile source of good resolutions, which saw him renouncing all the goods of this world in favour of his long-cherished dream of a life in the desert, with a wide blue sky as his sole wealth. After ten minutes, his knees, bruised by the flagstones, hurt so much that he gradually felt his whole body fainting away into an ecstasy in which he saw himself as a great conqueror, master of a vast empire, throwing away his crown, breaking his sceptre, and trampling under his feet untold splendour, caskets full of gold, cascades of jewels, cloth studded with precious stones, to go and bury himself in some remote desert hut, clad in a rough shirt that scratched his spine. But Mass now dragged him out of these fantasies, from which he emerged as if from some lovely, real story, that he would have lived through in ancient times. He took Communion, sang ardently the psalm of the day, not hearing any other voice than his own, a voice of crystal purity, so clear that he could hear it soaring up to the ears of the Lord. And when he was going back up to his room, he mounted the stairs one step at a time, as directed by Saint Bonaventure and Saint Thomas Aquinas;* he walked slowly, deep in meditation, with slightly bowed head, finding an exquisite pleasure in following even the most minute recommendations. Then it was breakfast time. In the refectory, the hunks of bread, lined up alongside glasses of white wine, filled him with delight, for he had a good appetite and a merry disposition, saying, for instance, that the wine was a very Christian wine, in a bold allusion to the water the bursar was accused of adding to the bottles. This did not stop him resuming his air of gravity when entering the classroom. He took notes on his knees, while the teacher, with his wrists on the edge of the pulpit, spoke in his usual Latin, with the occasional French word, when he could think of nothing better. Discussions then arose; and the students debated in a strange jargon, without finding it funny. Then, at ten o’clock came twenty minutes of reading from Holy Scripture. He went to get the sacred book, which was richly bound, with gilt-edged pages. He kissed the book with special reverence, and read it with his head bared, bowing each time he came upon the names of Jesus, Mary, or Joseph. The second meditation found him fully ready to bear, for the love of God, another period of kneeling, even longer than the first. He was careful not to sit back on his heels even for a second; he enjoyed the examination of conscience which lasted three-quarters of an hour, striving to find sins he had committed, and managing to believe himself damned for having forgotten, the previous evening, to kiss the images of his scapular, or for having fallen asleep on his left side: abominable sins that he would gladly have expiated by wearing out his knees until evening, but happy sins too, that demanded his attention, and without which he would not have known how to occupy his guileless heart, lulled by the blameless life he was leading. He went to the refectory quite comforted, as if he had unburdened himself of some great crime. The seminarists on duty, with the sleeves of their cassocks rolled up and a blue twill apron tied round their waists, were bringing the vermicelli soup, the boiled meat cut into little squares, and servings of mutton with beans. There was a terrible noise of jaws at work, a gluttonous silence, a furious plying of forks, interrupted only by envious glances at the horseshoe table, where the staff of the seminary ate more delicate meats and drank redder wine; meantime, above the ravenous munching, the toneless voice of some peasant’s son with sound lungs, and no respect for full stops or commas, stumbled through some pious reading-matter, missionaries’ letters, pastoral letters from bishops, or articles from the religious press. Between mouthfuls, he listened. These scraps of polemic, these accounts of far-off journeys, surprised and even frightened him, revealing a welter of activities and a vast horizon outside the walls of the seminary such as he never imagined. They were still eating when the noise of a wooden clapper board announced it was time for recreation. The yard was sandy, and planted with eight big plane trees which in summer provided a cooling shade; on the south side of the yard stood a thick wall, five metres high, bristling with broken glass, above which all you could see of Plassans was the tip of the spire of Saint Mark, a short stone needle, piercing the blue sky. He walked slowly, from one end of the yard to the other, in a single line, with a group of fellow students; and each time he came back, facing the wall, he looked at the spire, which for him was the whole town, the whole earth, beneath the free-floating clouds.","And he jumped out upon his strip of carpet, washed himself, made his bed, swept his room, and refilled his little pitcher. He enjoyed this petty domestic work while the morning air sent a thrilling shiver throughout his frame. He could hear the sparrows in the plane-trees of the court-yard, rising at the same time as himself with a deafening noise of wings and notes—their way of saying their prayers, thought he. Then he went down to the meditation room, and stayed there on his knees for half an hour after prayers, to con that reflection of St. Ignatius: 'What profit be it to a man to gain the whole world if he lose his soul?' A subject, this, fertile in good resolutions, which impelled him to renounce all earthly goods, and dwell on that fond dream of a desert life, beneath the solitary wealth and luxury of a vast blue sky. When ten minutes had passed, his bruised knees became so painful that his whole being slowly swooned into ecstasy, in which he pictured himself as a mighty conqueror, the master of an immense empire, flinging down his crown, breaking his sceptre, trampling under foot unheard-of wealth, chests of gold, floods of jewels, and rich stuffs embroidered with precious stones, before going to bury himself in some Thebais, clothed in rough drugget that rasped his back. Mass, however, snatched him from these heated fancies, upon which he looked back as upon some beautiful reality which might have been his lot in ancient times; and then, his communion made, he chanted the psalm for the day unconscious of any other voice than his own, which rang out with crystal purity, flying upward till it reached the very ear of the Lord. When he returned to his room he ascended the stairs step by step, as advised by St. Bonaventura and St. Thomas Aquinas. His gait was slow, his mien grave; he kept his head bowed as he walked along, finding ineffable delight in complying with the most trifling regulations. Next came breakfast. It was pleasant in the refectory to see the hunks of bread and the glasses of white wine, set out in rows. He had a good appetite, and was of a joyous mood. He would say, for instance, that the wine was truly Christian—a daring allusion to the water which the bursar was taxed with putting in the bottles. Still his gravity at once returned to him on going in to lectures. He took notes on his knees, while the professor, resting his hands on the edge of his desk, talked away in familiar Latin, interspersed with an occasional word in French, when he was at fault for a better. A discussion would then follow in which the students argued in a strange jargon, with never a smile upon their faces. Then, at ten o'clock, there came twenty minutes' reading of Holy Writ. He fetched the Sacred Book, a volume richly bound and gilt-edged. Having kissed it with especial reverence, he read it out bare-headed, bowing every time he came upon the name of Jesus, Mary, or Joseph. And with the arrival of the second meditation he was ready to endure for love of God another and even longer spell of kneeling than the first. He avoided resting on his heels for a second even. He delighted in that examination of conscience which lasted for three-quarters of an hour. He racked his memory for sins, and at times even fancied himself damned for forgetting to kiss the pictures on his scapular the night before, or for having gone to sleep upon his left side—abominable faults which he would have willingly redeemed by wearing out his knees till night; and yet happy faults, in that they kept him busy, for without them he would have no occupation for his unspotted heart, steeped in a life of purity. He would return to the refectory, as if relieved of some great crime. The seminarists on duty, wearing blue linen aprons, and having their cassock sleeves tucked up, brought in the vermicelli soup, the boiled beef cut into little squares, and the helps of roast mutton and French beans. Then followed a terrific rattling of jaws, a gluttonous silence, a desperate plying of forks, only broken by envious greedy glances at the horseshoe table, where the heads of the seminary ate more delicate meats and drank ruddier wines. And all the while above the hubbub some strong-lunged peasant's son, with a thick voice and utter disregard for punctuation, would hem and haw over the perusal of some letters from missionaries, some episcopal pastoral, or some article from a religious paper. To this he listened as he ate. Those polemical fragments, those narratives of distant travels, surprised, nay, even frightened him, with their revelations of bustling, boundless fields of action, of which he had never dreamt, beyond the seminary walls. Eating was still in progress when the wooden clapper announced the recreation hour. The recreation-ground was a sandy yard, in which stood eight plane-trees, which in summer cast cool shadows around. On the south side rose a wall, seventeen feet high, and bristling with broken glass, above which all that one saw of Plassans was the steeple of St. Mark, rising like a stony needle against the blue sky. To and fro he slowly paced the court with a row of fellow-students; and each time he faced the wall he eyed that spire which to him represented the whole town, the whole earth spread beneath the scudding clouds."
"— Attends, brigand ! hurla le Frère, les poings fermés.","""Wait, brigand! yelled the Brother, his fists clenched.","‘Just you wait, you brigand!’ shouted the Brother, his fists clenched.","'Take care, you bandit!' hissed the Brother, clenching his fists."
"Rosalie, que l’allocution du prêtre ennuyait, tourna vivement la tête, souriant à l’enfant. Mais quand elle le vit gigotant sur la chaise, elle eut peur ; elle jeta un regard terrible à Catherine.","Rosalie, bored by the priest's address, quickly turned her head, smiling at the child. But when she saw him fidgeting on the chair, she was frightened; she cast a terrible look at Catherine.","Rosalie, bored by the priest’s oration, looked round sharply, smiling at the child. But when she saw him jigging about on the chair, she was alarmed, and gave Catherine a terrible look.","Rosalie, who was beginning to find the priest's address rather tedious, turned her head to smile at the child. But, when she saw it kicking about on the chair, she grew alarmed, and cast an angry look at Catherine."
"L’abbé Mouret, interdit, ne trouva pas une parole. Il restait debout, au milieu d’une allée, à examiner cette étrange figure, ce solitaire couturé de rides, à la face de brique cuite, aux membres séchés et tordus comme des paquets de cordes, qui semblait porter ses quatre-vingts ans avec un dédain ironique de la vie.

He remained standing, in the middle of an alley, examining this strange face, this solitary man, riddled with wrinkles, with a face of baked brick, with limbs dried and twisted like bundles of cords, who seemed to carry his eighty years with an ironic disdain for life. The doctor having tried to take his pulse, he got angry again.","Abbé Mouret, quite astounded, could not find a word to say.

When the doctor attempted to feel his pulse, his ill-humour broke out afresh."
"— Dame, murmura-t-il, c’est qu’elle a bien voulu. Je ne l’ai pas forcée… Tant pis si le père Bambousse refuse de me la donner ! Vous avez bien vu que son chien cherchait à me mordre tout à l’heure. Il le lança contre moi.","""Lady,"" he murmured, ""it's because she wanted to. I didn't force it... Too bad if Father Bambousse refuses to give it to me!

"— Tu connais tout, tu sais les meilleurs endroits… On dirait une île de dix pieds carrés, rencontrée en pleine mer.","“You know everything, you know the best places… It looks like a ten-square-foot island, encountered in the open sea.","‘You really know everything, you know all the best places...

"Du coup, elles se mordaient toutes trois, dans un accès d’hilarité folle, lorsque la Teuse s’avança en boitant furieusement. Elle était allée prendre son balai derrière l’autel.

"— Va, je vais te rendre la liberté, dit Désirée qui s’aperçut de son malaise croissant. Mais, auparavant, il faut que je te montre encore quelque chose… Tu promets de ne pas me gronder ?

"Serge, invinciblement, marchait vers la brèche.

"Le grand chien noir hésita un instant, la queue battante, cherchant à lire dans les yeux du gamin. Puis, aboyant de joie, il descendit vers le village.

"La Teuse se hâta d’éteindre les cierges. Mais elle s’attarda à vouloir chasser les moineaux. Aussi, quand elle rapporta le Missel à la sacristie, ne trouva-t-elle plus l’abbé Mouret, qui avait rangé les ornements sacrés, après s’être lavé les mains.

"Puis, tout d’un coup, pendant que le cercueil descendait, soutenu par les cordes, dont les nœuds lui arrachaient des craquements, un tapage effroyable monta de la basse-cour, derrière le mur. La chèvre bêlait. Les canards, les oies, les dindes, claquaient du bec, battaient des ailes. Les poules chantaient l’œuf, toutes ensembles. Le coq fauve Alexandre jetait son cri de clairon. On entendait jusqu’aux bonds des lapins, ébranlant les planches de leurs cabines. Et, par-dessus toute cette vie bruyante du petit peuple des bêtes, un grand rire sonnait. Il y eut un froissement de jupes. Désirée, décoiffée, les bras nus jusqu’aux coudes, la face rouge de triomphe, parut, les mains appuyées au chaperon du mur.

You could even hear the leaps of the rabbits, shaking the planks of their cabins. And, above all this noisy life of the little people of beasts, a great laugh sounded. There was a rustle of skirts.

The tawny rooster Alexander was uttering his clarion call, and you could even hear the rabbits leaping about and shaking the planks of their hutches. And over and above all the lively din of this little nation of animals, a huge laugh rang out. There was a rustling of skirts.

The yellow cock, Alexander, crowed forth his trumpet notes. The rabbits could even be heard leaping in their hutches and shaking their wooden floors. And, above all this lifeful uproar of the animal creation, a loud laugh rang out. There was a rustling of skirts. Desiree, with her hair streaming, her arms bare to the elbows, and her face crimson with triumph, burst into sight, her hands resting upon the coping of the wall.

— Et le père Bambousse n’a pas voulu venir ? demanda la Rousse.,"""And Father Bambousse didn't want to come?"" asked the Redhead.","‘Old Bambousse refused to come then, did he?’ asked La Rousse.",'And so old Bambousse wouldn't come?' said La Rousse.

"Elle souffletait la chèvre, elle dispersait les poules à coups de pied, elle tapait de toute la force de ses poings sur le mufle de la vache. Mais les bêtes se secouaient, revenaient plus goulues, sautaient sur elle, l’envahissaient, arrachaient son tablier. Et clignant les yeux, elle murmurait à l’oreille d’Albine, comme si les bêtes avaient pu l’entendre :","She slapped the goat, she kicked the hens apart, she slapped the cow's muzzle with all the force of her fists. But the beasts shook themselves, came back hungrier, jumped on her, invaded her, tore off her apron. And blinking her eyes, she whispered in Albine's ear, as if the animals had been able to hear her:","She slapped the goat, scattered the chickens with a few kicks, and hit the cow’s muzzle with the full force of her fists. But the animals shook themselves and came back, even greedier than before, jumping on her, pressing in on her, tugging at her apron. And with a wink, she whispered in Albine’s ear, as if the animals had been able to understand:","She drove the goat off, dispersed the fowls with her feet, and tapped the cow's nose with her fists. But the creatures just shook themselves, and then came back more greedily than ever, surrounding her, jumping on her, and tearing open her apron. At this she whispered to Albine, as though she were afraid the animals might hear her."

"Et, pendant l’antienne, les assistants instinctivement jetaient des coups d’œil furtifs au fond du trou, vide encore. Vincent, qui avait planté la croix au pied de la fosse, en face du prêtre, poussait du soulier de petits filets de terre, qu’il s’amusait à regarder tomber ; et cela faisait rire Catherine, penchée derrière lui, pour mieux voir. Les paysans avaient posé la bière sur l’herbe. Ils s’étiraient les bras, pendant que Frère Archangias préparait l’aspersoir.","And, during the antiphon, the assistants instinctively cast furtive glances at the bottom of the hole, still empty. Vincent, who had planted the cross at the foot of the grave, opposite the priest, was pushing little threads of earth from his shoe, which he enjoyed watching fall; and this made Catherine laugh, leaning behind him to see better. The peasants had put the beer on the grass. They stretched their arms, while Brother Archangias prepared the sprinkler.","And during the antiphon, everyone instinctively cast sidelong glances into the depths of the still empty hole. Vincent, who had planted the cross at the foot of the grave, facing the priest, was amusing himself by pushing little trickles of earth into the grave with his shoe, and watching them fall; and that made Catherine laugh, as she leaned over, behind him, to see. The peasants had laid the bier on the grass. They were stretching their arms, while Brother Archangias prepared the sprinkler for the holy water.","During the anthem, those who were present instinctively cast furtive glances towards the bottom of the empty grave. Vincent, who had planted the cross at the foot of the cavity opposite the priest, pushed the loose earth with his foot, and amused himself by watching it fall. This drew a laugh from Catherine, who was leaning forward from behind him to get a better view. The peasants had set the litter on the grass and were stretching their arms, while Brother Archangias prepared the sprinkler."
"— Prends-moi toute, prends ma vie.","“Take me all, take my life.","‘Take me, all of me, take my life.’","And Serge seemed to have awakened to life, lion-like, to rule the whole far expanse under the free heavens."
"Et comme il s’abandonnait peu à peu contre elle, elle lui passa un bras au cou, elle lui renversa la tête sur ses genoux, murmurant encore, à voix plus basse :","And as he abandoned himself little by little against her, she put an arm around his neck, she threw his head back on her knees, still murmuring, in a lower voice:","And as he gradually leaned closer to her, she put an arm round his neck, and laid his head back against her knees, still murmuring, more quietly:","As Serge gradually leant more closely against her, she passed her arm round his neck and laid his head upon her lap, while murmuring in yet a lower tone: 'There is a little corner there"
"D’abord, elle courut au bois de roses. Là, dans la dernière lueur du crépuscule, elle fouilla les massifs, elle cueillit toutes les roses qui s’alanguissaient aux approches de l’hiver. Elle les cueillait à terre, sans se soucier des épines ; elle les cueillait devant elle, des deux mains ; elle les cueillait au-dessus d’elle, se haussant sur les pieds, ployant les arbustes. Une telle hâte la poussait, qu’elle cassait les branches, elle qui avait le respect des moindres brins d’herbe. Bientôt elle eut des roses plein les bras, un fardeau de roses sous lequel elle chancelait. Puis, elle rentra au pavillon, ayant dépouillé le bois, emportant jusqu’aux pétales tombés ; et quand elle eut laissé glisser sa charge de roses sur le carreau de la chambre au plafond bleu, elle redescendit dans le parterre.","First she ran to the rosewood. There, in the last light of twilight, she searched the beds, she picked all the roses that languished at the approach of winter. She plucked them from the ground, without worrying about the thorns; she plucked them in front of her, with both hands; she plucked them above her, raising herself on her feet, bending the shrubs. Such haste pushed her that she broke the branches, she who had the respect of the smallest blades of grass. Soon she had roses in her arms, a burden of roses under which she staggered. Then she returned to the pavilion, having stripped the wood, carrying away even the fallen petals; and when she had let her load of roses slide on the tiled floor of the room with the blue ceiling, she went back down to the floor.","First she ran to the arbour of roses. There, by the last glimmer of twilight, she searched through the thickets, and picked all the roses that were drooping at the approach of winter. She picked them off the ground, without bothering about the thorns; she picked them in front of her, with her two hands; and picked them from above her head, standing on tiptoe and pulling the branches down. She was driven by such haste that she broke some branches, she who had such respect for the slightest blades of grass. Soon she had armfuls of roses, such a burden of roses that she staggered beneath it. Then after stripping the arbour, she went back to the lodge, carrying even the fallen petals; and when she had let her load of roses slide on to the floor of the bedroom with the blue ceiling, she went back down to the flower garden.","First she hastened to the thicket-like rosary. There, in the last flickering of the gloaming, she searched the beds and gathered all the roses that hung languishing at the approach of winter. She plucked them from down below, quite heedless of their thorns; she plucked them in front of her, with both hands; she plucked them from above, rising upon tip-toes and pulling down the boughs. So eager was she, so desperate was her haste, that she even broke the branches, she, who had ever shown herself tender to the tiniest blades of grass. Soon her arms were full of roses, she tottered beneath her burden of flowers. And having quite stripped the rose trees, carrying away even the fallen petals, she turned her steps to the pavilion; and when she had let her load of blossoms slip upon the floor of the room with the blue ceiling, she again went down to the garden."
"— Voyez-vous, le gaillard ! dit-elle gaiement. Demain, il sautera par la fenêtre, si on le laisse faire… Nous sommes donc tout à fait solide, maintenant ?","""You see, fellow! she said cheerfully. Tomorrow, he will jump out the window, if we let him... So we are completely solid now?","‘Well, now, what a strapping fellow!’ she said gaily. ‘Tomorrow he’ll be jumping out of the window, if nobody stops him... So we’re feeling pretty solid now, are we?’","'Good gracious, we are active this morning!' she exclaimed gleefully. ' Why, he will be jumping out of the window to-morrow if he has his own way ——So you are quite strong now, eh?'"
"Il la prit sur lui, la renversa sur ses genoux, en mettant son visage à côté du sien.","He picked her up, pushed her onto his lap, putting his face next to hers.","He drew her to him, and set her on his knees, putting his face alongside hers.","He sat her on his lap, placing his face beside hers."
"Il fit signe qu’il n’avait pas soif. Il regardait les mains d’Albine d’un air si surpris, si charmé de les voir, qu’elle en avança une, au bord de l’oreiller, en souriant. Alors, il laissa glisser sa tête, il appuya une joue sur cette petite main fraîche. Il eut un léger rire, il dit :","He made a sign that he was not thirsty. He looked at Albine's hands with an air so surprised, so charmed to see them, that she put one out to the edge of the pillow, smiling. So he let his head slide, he pressed a cheek to that cool little hand. He had a light laugh, he said:","He made a gesture to show he was not thirsty. He was looking at Albine’s hands, looking so surprised and so delighted to see them that she held out one of them and laid it on his pillow with a smile. Then he let his head slide over, and rested his cheek upon that small, cool hand. He gave a little laugh and said:","He made a sign that he was not thirsty.

"Elle, souriait toujours, ravie de le voir ainsi s’éveiller. Alors, il parut se souvenir, il reprit, avec un geste de confiance heureuse :","She was still smiling, delighted to see him waking up like this. Then he seemed to remember, he resumed, with a gesture of happy confidence:","She just smiled, delighted at seeing him awake like this. Then he seemed to remember; he went on with a gesture of happy reassurance:","he asked her. And still she smiled, transported with delight at marking this awakening of his senses. Then he seemed to remember something, and continued with a gesture of happy confidence:"
"— Alors, demanda de nouveau le prêtre, ce mariage ?…","""So,"" asked the priest again, ""this marriage?...","‘So,’ the priest asked once more, ‘what about this marriage?’","'So then,' again asked the priest, 'this marriage?'"

Go, the earth is solid.","‘Anyone would think you were afraid of getting your feet wet,’ said Albine. ‘ Come on, the ground is quite solid.’","'One would think you were afraid of wetting yourself,' said Albine. ' Don't be frightened, the ground is safe enough.'"
"— Ah ! le cher bambin ! dit Albine, en regardant Serge qui s’était endormi à son cou, en même temps que le ciel.","- Ah! the dear child! said Albine, looking at Serge, who had fallen asleep around her neck, at the same time as the sky.","‘Ah! the dear little child!’ said Albine, looking at Serge, who had fallen asleep on her shoulder at the same time as the sky.","'Oh, the dear baby!' exclaimed Albine, as she looked at Serge, who had fallen asleep upon her neck at the same time as the heavens."

"C’était Albine qui conduisait Serge, bien qu’elle parût se livrer à lui, faible, soutenue à son épaule. Elle le mena d’abord à la grotte. Au fond d’un bouquet de peupliers et de saules, une rocaille se creusait, effondrée, des blocs de rochers tombés dans une vasque, des filets d’eau coulant à travers les pierres. La grotte disparaissait sous l’assaut des feuillages. En bas, des rangées de roses trémières semblaient barrer l’entrée d’une grille de fleurs rouges, jaunes, mauves, blanches, dont les bâtons se noyaient dans des orties colossales, d’un vert de bronze, suant tranquillement les brûlures de leur poison. Puis, c’était un élan prodigieux, grimpant en quelques bonds : les jasmins, étoilés de leurs fleurs suaves ; les glycines, aux feuilles de dentelle tendre ; les lierres épais, découpés comme de la tôle vernie ; les chèvrefeuilles souples, criblés de leurs brins de corail pâle ; les clématites amoureuses, allongeant les bras, pomponnées d’aigrettes blanches. Et d’autres plantes, plus frêles, s’enlaçaient encore à celles-ci, les liaient davantage, les tissaient d’une trame odorante. Des capucines, aux chairs verdâtres et nues, ouvraient des bouches d’or rouge. Des haricots d’Espagne, forts comme des ficelles minces, allumaient de place en place l’incendie de leurs étincelles vives. Des volubilis élargissaient le cœur découpé de leurs feuilles, sonnaient de leurs milliers de clochettes un silencieux carillon de couleurs exquises. Des pois de senteur, pareils à des vols de papillons posés, repliaient leurs ailes fauves, leurs ailes roses, prêts à se laisser emporter plus loin, par le premier souffle de vent. Chevelure immense de verdure, piquée d’une pluie de fleurs, dont les mèches débordaient de toutes parts, s’échappaient en un échevellement fou, faisaient songer à quelque fille géante, pâmée au loin sur les reins, renversant la tête dans un spasme de passion, dans un ruissellement de crins superbes, étalés comme une mare de parfums.","It was Albine who was leading Serge, although she seemed to surrender herself to him, weak, supported on his shoulder. She led him first to the cave. At the bottom of a clump of poplars and willows, a rockery was hollowed out, collapsed, blocks of rocks fallen into a basin, trickles of water flowing through the stones. The cave disappeared under the onslaught of foliage. Below, rows of hollyhocks seemed to bar the entrance to a grid of red, yellow, mauve, white flowers, whose sticks drowned in colossal nettles, of a bronze green, quietly sweating the burns of their poison. Then, there was a prodigious momentum, climbing in a few leaps: the jasmines, starry with their sweet flowers; the wisteria, with tender lacy leaves; the thick ivy, cut like varnished sheet metal; the supple honeysuckles, riddled with their wisps of pale coral; the amorous clematis, stretching out their arms, dolled up with white crests. And other plants, more frail, were still entwined with these, binding them even more, weaving them into a fragrant web. Nasturtiums, with greenish and bare flesh, opened mouths of red gold. Runner beans, strong as thin strings, lighted the fire here and there with their lively sparks. Morning glories expanded the cut-out heart of their leaves, ringing with their thousands of bells a silent chime of exquisite colors. Sweet peas, like flights of butterflies, folded their tawny wings, their pink wings, ready to let themselves be carried away by the first breath of wind. Immense green hair, studded with a shower of flowers, the locks of which overflowed on all sides, escaping in a mad mess, made one think of some giant girl, swooning in the distance on her back, throwing her head back in a spasm of passion, in a stream of superb horsehair, spread out like a pool of perfumes.","Although she seemed to have yielded herself to him, weak and leaning on his shoulder, it was Albine who was guiding Serge. She took him first to the grotto. Deep within a cluster of poplars and willows, there spread out before them a sort of collapsed rockery, rocks that had tumbled into the basin of a fountain, with water trickling over the stones. The grotto had disappeared under the invasion of foliage. Below, rows of hollyhocks seemed to bar the entrance with a fence of red, yellow, mauve, and white flowers, whose stems lay hidden among gigantic brownish-green nettles, quietly exuding the stinging fire of their poison. Then came a prodigious leap, the vegetation climbing in a few bounds: jasmines, starred with sweet-scented flowers; wisterias with their leaves of delicate lace; dense ivy, serrated like varnished metal; lithe honeysuckle, dotted with fine sprigs of pale coral; amorous clematis, stretching out its arms in white-plumed finery. And other, more slender plants, winding around these, bound them more closely, weaving them together with their fragrant twine. Nasturtiums, with bare and greenish bodies, opened their mouths of red and gold. Scarlet runners, strong as slender cords, here and there lit the blaze of their vivid sparks; convolvulus spread out the serrated heart of its leaves, and with its thousands of bells rang a silent carillon of exquisite colours. Sweet peas, like flights of butterflies just alighting, folded their tawny wings and their pink wings, ready to be carried far away by the first puff of wind. Altogether it was like a huge head of hair made of greenery, dotted with a scattering of flowers, its locks overflowing on all sides, escaping into wild disorder, suggesting some gigantic girl, lying on her back, swooning in the distance, throwing back her head in a spasm of passion, and sending her splendid hair streaming out and spreading like a pool of perfume.","Though to outward seeming Albine had yielded her weaker self to the guidance of Serge, to whose shoulder she clung, it was she who really led him. She took him first to the grotto. Deep within a clump of poplars and willows gaped a cavern, formed by rugged bits of rocks which had fallen over a basin where tiny rills of water trickled between the stones. The grotto was completely lost to sight beneath the onslaught of vegetation. Below, row upon row of hollyhocks seemed to bar all entrance with a trellis-work of red, yellow, mauve, and white-hued flowers, whose stems were hidden among colossal bronze-green nettles, which calmly exuded blistering poison. Above them was a mighty swarm of creepers which leaped aloft in a few bounds; jasmines starred with balmy flowers; wistarias with delicate lacelike leaves; dense ivy, dentated and resembling varnished metal; lithe honeysuckle, laden with pale coral sprays; amorous clematideae, reaching out arms all tufted with white aigrettes. And among them twined yet slenderer plants, binding them more and more closely together, weaving them into a fragrant woof. Nasturtium, bare and green of skin, showed open mouths of ruddy gold; scarlet runners, tough as whipcord, kindled here and there a fire of gleaming sparks; convolvuli opened their heart-shaped leaves, and with thousands of little bells rang a silent peal of exquisite colours; sweetpeas, like swarms of settling butterflies, folded tawny or rosy wings, ready to be borne yet farther away by the first breeze. It was all a wealth of leafy locks, sprinkled with a shower of flowers, straying away in wild dishevelment, and suggesting the head of some giantess thrown back in a spasm of passion, with a streaming of magnificent hair, which spread into a pool of perfume."

"Mais, brusquement, à l’entrée du village, il se planta au milieu de la route.

Il avait un grognement de chien qui flaire un danger.","But suddenly, at the entrance to the village, he stopped in the middle of the road.

"Quand l’abbé Mouret se retrouva seul, dans la poussière du chemin, il se sentit plus à l’aise. Ces champs pierreux rendaient à son rêve de rudesse, de vie intérieure vécue au désert. Le long du chemin creux, les arbres avaient laissé tomber sur sa nuque des fraîcheurs inquiétantes, que maintenant le soleil ardent séchait. Les maigres amandiers, les blés pauvres, les vignes infirmes, aux deux bords de la route, l’apaisaient, le tiraient du trouble où l’avaient jeté les souffles trop gras du Paradou. Et, au milieu de la clarté aveuglante qui coulait du ciel sur cette terre nue, les blasphèmes de Jeanbernat ne mettaient même plus une ombre. Il eut une joie vive lorsque, en levant la tête, il aperçut à l’horizon la barre immobile du Solitaire, avec la tache des tuiles roses de l’église.","When Father Mouret found himself alone, in the dust of the road, he felt more at ease. These stony fields gave back to his dream of harshness, of inner life lived in the desert. Along the sunken lane, the trees had dropped a disturbing coolness on his neck, which the blazing sun was now drying. The sparse almond trees, the poor wheat, the infirm vines, on both sides of the road, soothed him, drew him from the confusion into which the excessively greasy breaths of Paradou had thrown him. And, in the midst of the blinding light that streamed from the sky onto this bare earth, Jeanbernat's blasphemies no longer cast even a shadow. He was overjoyed when, raising his head, he saw on the horizon the motionless helm of the Solitaire, with the stain of the pink tiles of the church.","When Abbé Mouret was alone again, walking in the dust of the road, he felt more at ease. These stony fields brought back his dreams of severity, of an inner life lived in a desert. All along the lane the trees had dripped splashes of disturbing coolness on his neck, which were now being dried by the burning sun. The lean almond trees, the meagre corn, and the sickly vines on each side of the road seemed to calm him, drawing him out from the troubled state into which the too rich atmosphere of the Paradou had thrown him. And in the blinding light that flowed down from the sky upon this barren ground, the blasphemies of Jeanbernat no longer cast the slightest shadow. He felt a sudden surge of joy when, raising his head, he saw in the distance the motionless outline of the Lone Tree, and the patch of pink tiles on the church.","Abbe Mouret felt more at ease when he found himself again alone, walking along the dusty road. The stony fields brought him back to his dream of austerity, of an inner life spent in a desert. From the trees all along the sunken road disturbing moisture had fallen on his neck, which now the burning sun was drying. The sight of the lean almond trees, the scanty corn crops, the weak vines, on either side of the way, soothed him, delivered him from the perturbation into which the lusty atmosphere of the Paradou had thrown him. Amid the blinding glare that flowed from heaven over the bare land, Jeanbernat's blasphemies no longer cast even a shadow. A thrill of pleasure ran through the priest as he raised his head and caught sight of the solitaire's motionless bar-like silhouette and the pink patch of tiles on the church."
"Elle les remit à terre. Mais les autres poules arrivaient, pour manger le riz. Un grand coq rouge, aux plumes flambantes, les suivait, en levant ses larges pattes avec une majesté circonspecte.","She put them down. But the other hens were coming, to eat the rice. A great red rooster, with flaming feathers, followed them, raising its broad paws with guarded majesty.","She put them back down. But now the other hens were coming along to eat the rice.

"Mais elle n’attendit pas la réponse. Elle se jeta au milieu d’une bande de poules, qui buvaient goulûment le sang, dans les terrines. Elle les dispersa à coups de pied, furieuse.

"Mais Serge l’arrêta. Ils étaient alors au centre d’une ancienne colonnade en ruine. Des fûts de colonne faisaient des bancs, parmi des touffes de primevères et de pervenches. Au loin, entre les colonnes restées debout, d’autres champs de fleurs s’étendaient ; des champs de tulipes, aux vives panachures de faïences peintes ; des champs de calcéolaires, légères soufflures de chair, ponctuées de sang et d’or ; des champs de zinnias, pareils à de grosses pâquerettes courroucées ; des champs de pétunias, aux pétales molles comme une batiste de femme, montrant le rose de la peau ; des champs encore, des champs à l’infini, dont on ne reconnaissait plus les fleurs, dont les tapis s’étalaient sous le soleil, avec la bigarrure confuse des touffes violentes, noyée dans les verts attendris des herbes.","But Serge stopped him. They were then in the center of an old ruined colonnade. Column shafts formed benches among tufts of primroses and periwinkles. In the distance, between the columns that remained standing, other fields of flowers stretched; fields of tulips, with vivid variegations of painted earthenware; fields of calceolaria, slight puffs of flesh, punctuated with blood and gold; fields of zinnias, like big angry daisies; fields of petunias, with soft petals like a woman's cambric, showing the pink of the skin; fields again, fields to infinity, whose flowers you could no longer recognize, whose carpets were spread out under the sun, with the confused variegation of violent tufts, drowned in the softened greens of the grass.","But Serge held her back. They were just then in the centre of an old, ruined colonnade. Pieces of broken columns had created benches among clumps of primroses and periwinkles. Further on, among the columns still standing, lay other fields of flowers: tulips, with their vivid colours like painted pottery; calceolarias, light pouches of flesh, speckled with blood and gold; zinnias like big angry daisies; petunias with soft petals like a woman’s fine batiste, showing the pink skin underneath; more and more fields, endless fields, with flowers no longer recognizable rolling out their carpets in the sunshine, with the confused, motley patterns of stridently bright clumps submerged in the gentle green of the grasses.","But Serge stopped. They were now in the midst of an old ruined colonnade. Some of the columns offered inviting seats as they lay prostrate amongst primroses and periwinkles. Further away, among the columns that still remained upright, other flowers were growing in profusion. There were expanses of tulips showing brilliant streaks like painted china; expanses of calceolarias dotted with crimson and gold; expanses of zinnias like great daisies; expanses of petunias with petals like soft cambric through which rosy flesh tints gleamed; and other fields, with flowers they could not recognise spreading in carpets beneath the sun, in a motley brilliance that was softened by the green of their leaves."

"Il n’ouvrit plus les lèvres, il accompagna l’abbé Mouret jusqu’au presbytère. Là, il attendit qu’il eût refermé la porte, avant de se retirer ; même il se retourna, à deux reprises, pour s’assurer qu’il ne ressortait pas. Quand le prêtre fut dans sa chambre, il se jeta tout habillé sur son lit, les mains aux oreilles, la face contre l’oreiller, pour ne plus entendre, pour ne plus voir. Il s’anéantit, il s’endormit d’un sommeil de mort.","He no longer opened his lips; he accompanied the Abbé Mouret to the presbytery. There he waited until he had closed the door before withdrawing; he even turned around, twice, to make sure he didn't come out. When the priest was in his room, he threw himself fully dressed on his bed, his hands to his ears, his face against the pillow, so as not to hear any more, so as not to see any more. He annihilated himself, he fell asleep a deathly sleep.","After that, he said no more. He accompanied Abbé Mouret to the presbytery and waited there for him to shut the door before leaving; he even turned round to make sure the abbé wasn’t coming out again. When the priest reached his room, he threw himself fully clothed on the bed, with his hands over his ears, and his face in the pillow, so as not to hear, and not to see. He totally collapsed, fell asleep, and slept like the dead.","Then without again opening his lips he accompanied Abbe Mouret to the parsonage. And he waited outside till the door was closed. Even then he did not go off without twice looking round to make sure that the Abbe was not coming out again. As for the priest, when he reached his bedroom, he threw himself in his clothes upon his bed, clasping his hands to his ears, and pressing his face to the pillow, in order that he might shut out all sound and sight. And thus stilling his senses he fell into death-like slumber."

Mais Serge s’écria qu’on était trop bien deux, et ils jurèrent de n’être toujours que deux.","Albine knew how to play all the games. Only, it was necessary to be at least three to play hot hand.

"La Teuse ne put tenir davantage. Elle passa derrière l’autel, atteignit le cierge, qu’elle nettoya, du bout de ses ciseaux. Le cierge coulait. Il y avait déjà deux grandes larmes de cire perdues.

"Mais elle lui coupa la parole d’un nouveau regard, si fixe, si fâché, qu’il eut les jambes comme rompues. Il s’assit, il se mit à manger.

"Assise près d’une console où une bouilloire chauffait sur une lampe à esprit-de-vin, Albine regardait les rideaux de l’alcôve, attentivement. Elle était vêtue de blanc, les cheveux serrés dans un fichu de vieille dentelle, les mains abandonnées, veillant d’un air sérieux de grande fille. Une respiration faible, un souffle d’enfant assoupi s’entendait, dans le grand silence. Mais elle s’inquiéta, au bout de quelques minutes ; elle ne put s’empêcher de venir, à pas légers, soulever le coin d’un rideau. Serge, au bord du grand lit, semblait dormir, la tête appuyée sur l’un de ses bras replié. Pendant sa maladie, ses cheveux s’étaient allongés, sa barbe avait poussé. Il était très blanc, les yeux meurtris de bleu, les lèvres pâles ; il avait une grâce de fille convalescente.","Seated near a console where a kettle was heating on a spirit lamp, Albine watched the curtains of the alcove attentively. She was dressed in white, her hair tied up in a kerchief of old lace, her hands outstretched, keeping watch with the serious air of a grown girl. Weak breathing, the breath of a drowsy child could be heard in the great silence. But she grew worried after a few minutes; she could not help coming, with light steps, to lift the corner of a curtain. Serge, on the edge of the big bed, seemed to be asleep, his head resting on one of his folded arms. During his illness, his hair had lengthened, his beard had grown. He was very white, his eyes bruised with blue, his lips pale; he had the grace of a convalescent girl.","Sitting beside a small table, on which a kettle was being heated over a spirit lamp, Albine was gazing attentively at the alcove curtains. She was dressed in white, her hair bound up in a scarf of old lace, her hands lying empty beside her, keeping watch with the serious look of a grown-up girl. A faint sound of breathing, like the breath of a sleeping child, could be heard in the deep silence. But she became anxious, and after a few minutes could not resist going over very quietly to lift up a bit of the curtain. Serge, on the edge of the big bed, seemed to be asleep, his head resting on one of his folded arms. During his illness, his hair had got longer, and he had grown a beard. He was very white, with bruised eyelids and pallid lips; he had the grace of a convalescent girl.","Seated near a pier table, on which a little kettle bubbled over a spirit-lamp, Albine intently watched the alcove curtains. She was gowned in white, her hair gathered up in an old lace kerchief, her hands drooping wearily, as she kept watch with the serious mien of youthful womanhood. A faint breathing, like that of a slumbering child, could be heard in the deep silence. But she grew restless after a few minutes, and could not restrain herself from stepping lightly towards the alcove and raising one of the curtains. On the edge of the big bed lay Serge, apparently asleep, with his head resting on his bent arm. During his illness his hair had lengthened, and his beard had grown. He looked very white, with sunken eyes and pallid lips."
"Et elle l’adossa contre le mûrier, dans la pluie de soleil tombant des branches. Puis, elle le laissa, elle s’en alla d’un bond, en lui criant de ne pas bouger. Serge, les mains pendantes, tournait lentement la tête, en face du parc. C’était une enfance. Les verdures pâles se noyaient d’un lait de jeunesse, baignaient dans une clarté blonde. Les arbres restaient puérils, les fleurs avaient des chairs de bambin, les eaux étaient bleues d’un bleu naïf de beaux yeux grands ouverts. Il y avait, jusque sous chaque feuille, un réveil adorable.","And she leaned him against the mulberry tree, in the rain of sunlight falling from the branches. Then, she left him, she went away with a bound, shouting at him not to move. Serge, his hands dangling, slowly turned his head, facing the park. It was a childhood. The pale greenery was drowned in the milk of youth, bathed in a blond light. The trees remained childish, the flowers had the flesh of toddlers, the waters were blue with a naive blue of beautiful eyes wide open. There was, even under each leaf, an adorable alarm clock.","She settled him with his back against the mulberry tree, in the shower of sunshine falling from its branches. Then she left him, bounding away and shouting to tell him not to move. Serge, with drooping hands, slowly turned his face towards the park. It was childhood everywhere. The pale greenery, steeped in the milk of youth, was bathed in a blond radiance. The trees were still in their infancy, the flowers had the soft skin of babies, the water was blue with the innocent blue of beautiful eyes wide open. There was a delightful awakening under every leaf.","Having placed him with his back leaning against the mulberry tree, in the rain of sunlight falling from its boughs, she bounded off and left him, calling out to him that he must not stir. Serge, standing there with drooping hands, slowly turned his head towards the park. Terrestrial childhood met his gaze. The pale greenery was steeped in the very milk of youth, flooded with golden brightness. The trees were still in infancy, the flowers were as tender-fleshed as babes, the streams were blue with the artless blue of lovely infantile eyes. Beneath every leaf was some token of a delightful awakening."
"— Vois, je suis guéri ; tu m’as donné toute ta santé.","“See, I am cured; you gave me all your health.","‘See, I’m cured; you’ve given me all your health.’","And Serge seemed to have awakened to life, lion-like, to rule the whole far expanse under the free heavens."

When I kiss your hair, when I plunge my face into it, I drink up your life.’","And he drew her once more towards him and held her there, dreaming aloud, and murmuring: 'Perhaps I have lived before. It must have been a long, long time ago. . . . I loved you in a painful dream. You had the same blue eyes, the same rather long face, the same youthful mien. But your hair was carefully hidden under a linen cloth, and I never dared to remove that cloth, because your locks seemed to me fearsome and would have made me die. But to-day your hair is the very sweetness of yourself. It preserves your scent, and when I kiss it, when I bury my face in it like this, I drink in your very life.'"

"— Et ma sœur, où est-elle donc ? Je ne l’entends pas.","""And my sister, where is she?"" I can't hear it.",‘And where is my sister? I can’t hear her.’,'Where is my sister? I don't hear her.'
"— Comment, ce n’est pas permis ! cria le vieux. Eh bien ! je me le permettrai !… Est-ce qu’elle n’est pas à moi ? Est-ce que vous croyez que je vais me la laisser prendre par les curés ? Qu’ils essayent, s’ils veulent être reçus à coups de fusil.","""What, it's not allowed!"" shouted the old man. Well ! I will allow myself!... Isn't she mine? Do you think I'm going to let the priests take her? Let them try, if they want to be received with gunshots.","‘What do you mean — not allowed!’ the old man cried. ‘Well, I shall allow it! Doesn’t she belong to me? Do you think I’m going to let her be taken away from me by the priests? Just let them try, if they want to be shot at.’","'What! it isn't allowed!' cried Jeanbernat. ' Well, then, I will allow it myself! Doesn't she belong to me? Isn't she mine? Do you think I am going to let the priests walk off with her? Let them try, if they want to get a shot from my gun!'"
— Oui. Pourquoi me fais-tu cette question ?,- Yes. Why are you asking me this question?,"he asked. ‘Yes, why do you ask me that?’",he asked. 'Yes; why do you ask that?'
"Un éclat de rire, frais comme une haleine de la nuit, monta du sentier. Puis, il y eut une course légère, un murmure de robe coulant sur l’herbe, pareil à un frôlement de couleuvre. L’abbé Mouret, debout devant la fenêtre, suivait au loin une tache blonde glissant entre les bois de pins, ainsi qu’un reflet de lune. Les souffles qui lui arrivaient de la campagne, avaient ce puissant parfum de verdure, cette odeur de fleurs sauvages qu’Albine secouait de ses bras nus, de sa taille libre, de ses cheveux dénoués.","A burst of laughter, fresh as the breath of the night, rose from the path. Then there was a light running, the murmur of a dress running over the grass, like the rustle of a grass snake. Abbé Mouret, standing in front of the window, was watching in the distance a fair spot sliding between the pine woods, like the reflection of the moon. The breaths which came to her from the countryside had that powerful perfume of verdure, that odor of wild flowers which Albine shook with her bare arms, her free figure, her loose hair.","A burst of laughter, fresh as a breath of the night, rose from the path. Then came the sound of light footsteps running and the swish of a dress on the grass, like the slithering of a snake. Standing at the window, Abbé Mouret could just make out in the distance a patch of light colour sliding in and out of the pine trees, like a reflection of moonlight. The breezes from the countryside had that powerful scent of greenery, that perfume of wild flowers that Albine scattered from her bare arms, her unfettered figure, and her flowing hair.","A peal of laughter, fresh as the breath of night, rang out from the path, followed by light hasty footsteps and the swish of a dress rustling through the grass like an adder. Abbe Mouret, standing at the window, saw something golden glide through the pine trees like a moonbeam. The breeze, wafted in from the open country, was now laden with that penetrating perfume of verdure, that scent of wildflowers, which Albine had scattered from her bare arms, unfettered bosom, and streaming tresses at the Paradou."
"A ce moment, trois grandes filles entrèrent. Elles se poussaient, pour voir, sans oser pourtant trop avancer. C’étaient trois amies de la Rosalie, qui, en allant aux champs, venaient de s’échapper, curieuses d’entendre ce que monsieur le curé dirait aux mariés. Elles avaient de gros ciseaux pendus à la ceinture. Elles finirent par se cacher derrière le baptistère, se pinçant, se tordant avec des déhanchements de grandes vauriennes, étouffant des rires dans leurs poings fermés.","At this moment, three tall girls entered. They pushed each other, to see, without however daring to advance too much. They were three friends of Rosalie, who, on their way to the fields, had just escaped, curious to hear what the priest would say to the bride and groom. They had big scissors hanging from their belts. They ended up hiding behind the baptistery, pinching each other, writhing with the swaying of big rascals, stifling laughter in their closed fists.","Just then, three big girls came in. They were jostling with each other to get a better view, but not daring to come in too far. They were three friends of Rosalie’s who, on their way to the fields, had rushed off, eager to hear what the priest would have to say to the newly-weds. They had big scissors hanging from their belts. They ended up hiding behind the font, pinching each other, wriggling about, swinging their hips like trollops, and stifling their laughter with clenched fists.","At that moment three big girls came into the church. They were too shy to go far up, though they jostled one another to get a better view of what was going on. They were three friends of Rosalie, who had dropped in for a minute or two on their way to the fields, curious as they were to hear what his reverence would say to the bride and bridegroom. They had big scissors hanging at their waists. At last they hid themselves behind the font, where they pinched each other and twisted themselves about, while trying to choke their bursts of laughter with their clenched fists."
"— Viens donc voir les bêtes !… Tu n’as pas encore vu les bêtes, dis ! Si tu savais comme elles sont belles, maintenant !","""Come and see the beasts!... You haven't seen the beasts yet, tell me!"" If you only knew how beautiful they are now!","‘Come and see the animals!... You haven’t seen the animals yet, have you! If you only knew how handsome they are now!’","'Do come and see the animals! You haven't seen the animals yet, have you? If you only knew how beautiful they are now!'"
"— À quoi bon ! dit-il. N’est-on pas bien dans le parterre ? Il faudra rester avec les fleurs, vois-tu, sans chercher si loin un bonheur plus grand.","- What's the point ! he said. Are we not well in the floor? You will have to stay with the flowers, you see, without looking so far away for a greater happiness.","‘But why bother?’ he said. ‘Aren’t we happy here in the flower garden? Better by far to stay here with the flowers, don’t you think, than going so far to search for a greater happiness.’","What would be the use?' he said. ' Is it not pleasant in the parterre? Don't you think we ought to remain among the flowers, instead of seeking a greater happiness that lies so far away?'"
"— C’est toi qui as ce chant, dit-il ; jamais je n’en ai entendu d’aussi doux… Tu es ma joie.","“You have that song,” he said; I have never heard so sweet… You are my joy.","‘Only you have this song,’ he said, ‘I never heard anything so sweet... You are such a delight to me.’","'What, that lovely song is yours?' he said. ' It is the sweetest I ever heard. You are indeed my joy.'"
"— Ce n’est pas pour l’église que je suis venu, répondit l’abbé Mouret. Je voulais vous parler de votre fille Rosalie…","""I didn't come for the church,"" replied Abbé Mouret. I wanted to talk to you about your daughter Rosalie…","‘It’s not the church I came to see you about,’ the abbé replied. ‘I came to talk to you about your daughter Rosalie...’","'It was not for the church I came,' replied the Abbe Mouret. ' I wanted to speak to you about your daughter Rosalie.'"
"L’autre, Babet, bossue, les os trop gros, ricanait.","The other, Babet, hunchbacked, bones too big, sneered.","The other girl, Babet, a hunchback, with bones too big for her frame, said with a snigger:","The other girl, Babet, who was humpbacked, tittered. '"
Et Albine reprit en se rapprochant de lui :,"And Albine resumed, approaching him:","Albine went on, drawing closer to him:","But Albine came closer to him and said: 'There is something else that only a few people know, and that is that the lord and the lady discovered in the garden a certain spot where perfect happiness was to be found, and where they afterwards spent all their time."
"La petite grille du cimetière, qu’on avait voulu ouvrir toute grande, pour laisser passer le corps, pendait contre le mur, à demi arrachée. Dans le champ vide, le soleil dormait, sur les herbes sèches. Le convoi entra, en psalmodiant le dernier verset du Miserere. Et il y eut un silence.","The little gate of the cemetery, which they had wanted to open wide to let the body pass, hung against the wall, half torn away. In the empty field, the sun slept on the dry grass. The procession entered, chanting the last verse of the Miserere. And there was silence.","The little gate of the cemetery, that had been opened wide to make room for the body to come through, was now hanging, almost torn off its hinges, against the wall. In the empty field, the sun was sleeping on the dry grasses. The procession entered, chanting the last verse of the Miserere. Then there was a silence.","The little iron gate of the graveyard, which had been opened quite wide to let the body pass, hung against the wall, half torn from its hinges. The sunshine slept upon the herbage of the empty expanse, into which the funeral procession passed, chanting the last verse of the Miserere. Then silence fell."
"Alors, l’abbé, à son tour, tâcha d’avoir de nouveaux détails sur les gens du Paradou. Il écoutait avec une attention profonde le Frère qui racontait des faits monstrueux.","Then the abbé, in his turn, tried to get new details about the people of Paradou. He listened with deep attention to the Brother who was recounting monstrous facts.",Then the abbé in his turn tried to get some details about the people of the Paradou. He listened attentively as Brother Archangias told of monstrous doings.,"In his turn the Abbe then endeavoured to elicit some fresh particulars about the people at the Paradou, and listened intently to the Brother's monstrous narrative."
— Qu’as-tu ? cria-t-il. Souffres-tu ? T’es-tu blessée ?,- What have you ? he shouted. Are you in pain? Are you injured?,‘What’s wrong?’ he cried. ‘Are you not well? Have you hurt yourself?’,'What is the matter with you?' he exclaimed; 'are you in pain? Have you hurt yourself?'
"— Peut être est-ce ce coin de fleurs tristes, où tu m’as montré un enfant debout, le bras cassé ?","""Perhaps it's that corner of sad flowers where you showed me a child standing with his arm broken?","‘Perhaps it’s that place with the sad flowers, where you showed me a child still standing, with a broken arm.’","'Perhaps it is hidden somewhere away amongst those mournful-looking flowers, where you showed me the figure of a boy standing with his arm broken off.'"
— Jetez donc ça !,"""Throw that away!""",‘Throw that stuff away!’,"And as Abbe Mouret had kept the withered bunches of flowers in his hand, Brother Archangias said to him, as they passed the farmyard: 'Throw those things away.'"

"Serge disait, la reprenant dans ses bras forts :","Serge said, taking her back in his strong arms:","Serge, clasping her once more in his strong arms, said:","And Serge seemed to have awakened to life, lion-like, to rule the whole far expanse under the free heavens."
"Au bout d’un grand silence, Albine parla. Elle était debout, méprisante, résolue.","After a long silence, Albine spoke. She was on her feet, contemptuous, resolute.","After a long silence, Albine spoke. She was standing up, contemptuous and resolute.","Then, after a long silence, Albine spoke.

Nous sommes restés ensemble, à rire…","""I'm all ready,"" he declared, ""and so is Rosalie. I saw her yesterday, behind the mill."" We are not angry, on the contrary. We stayed together, laughing…","‘As for me, I’m very ready,’ he declared, ‘and so is Rosalie... I saw her yesterday, behind the mill. We haven’t quarrelled, far from it. We stopped and had a laugh about it...’","'Oh, I'm quite ready,' he said, 'and so is Rosalie. I saw her yesterday at the back of the mill. We haven't quarrelled.

"Que négligeait-il donc, pour être soumis à des épreuves si rudes ? Il essuya de la main la sueur qui coulait de ses tempes, il songea que, le matin encore, il avait fait son examen de conscience, sans trouver en lui aucune offense grave. Ne menait-il pas une vie d’austérités et de macérations ? N’aimait-il pas Dieu seul, aveuglément ? Ah ! qu’il l’aurait béni, s’il lui avait enfin rendu la paix, en le jugeant assez puni de sa faute. Mais jamais peut-être cette faute ne pourrait être expiée. Et, malgré lui, il revint à Albine, au Paradou, aux souvenirs cuisants. D’abord, il chercha des excuses. Un soir, il tombait sur le carreau de sa chambre, foudroyé par une fièvre cérébrale. Pendant trois semaines, il appartenait à cette crise de sa chair. Son sang, furieusement, lavait ses veines, jusqu’au bout de ses membres, grondait au travers de lui avec un vacarme de torrent lâché ; son corps, du crâne à la plante des pieds, était nettoyé, renouvelé, battu par un tel travail de la maladie, que souvent, dans son délire, il avait cru entendre les marteaux des ouvriers reclouant ses os. Puis, il s’éveillait, un matin, comme neuf. Il naissait une seconde fois, débarrassé de ce que vingt-cinq ans de vie avait déposé successivement en lui. Ses dévotions d’enfant, son éducation du séminaire, sa foi de jeune prêtre, tout s’en était allé, submergé, emporté, laissant la place nette. Certes, l’enfer seul l’avait préparé ainsi pour le péché, le désarmant, faisant de ses entrailles un lit de mollesse, où le mal pouvait entrer et dormir. Et lui, restait inconscient, s’abandonnait à ce lent acheminement vers la faute. Au Paradou, lorsqu’il rouvrait les yeux, il se sentait baigné d’enfance, sans mémoire du passé, n’ayant plus rien du sacerdoce. Ses organes avaient un jeu doux, un ravissement de surprise, à recommencer la vie, comme s’ils ne la connaissaient pas et qu’ils eussent une joie extrême à l’apprendre. Oh ! l’apprentissage délicieux, les rencontres charmantes, les adorables retrouvailles ! Ce Paradou était une grande félicité. En le mettant là, l’enfer savait bien qu’il y serait sans défense. Jamais, dans sa première jeunesse, il n’avait goûté à grandir une pareille volupté. Cette première jeunesse, s’il l’évoquait maintenant, lui apparaissait toute noire, passée loin du soleil, ingrate, blême, infirme. Aussi comme il avait salué le soleil, comme il s’était émerveillé du premier arbre, de la première fleur, du moindre insecte aperçu, du plus petit caillou ramassé ! Les pierres elles-mêmes le charmaient. L’horizon était un prodige extraordinaire. Ses sens, une matinée claire dont ses yeux s’emplissaient, une odeur de jasmin respirée, un chant d’alouette écouté, lui causaient des émotions si fortes, que ses membres défaillaient. Il avait pris un long plaisir à s’enseigner jusqu’aux plus légers tressaillements de la vie. Et le matin où Albine était née, à son côté, au milieu des roses ! Il riait encore d’extase à ce souvenir. Elle se levait ainsi qu’un astre nécessaire au soleil lui-même. Elle éclairait tout, expliquait tout. Elle l’achevait. Alors, il recommençait avec elle leurs promenades, aux quatre coins du Paradou. Il se rappelait les petits cheveux qui s’envolaient sur sa nuque, lorsqu’elle courait devant lui. Elle sentait bon, elle balançait des jupes tièdes, dont les frôlements ressemblaient à des caresses. Lorsqu’elle le prenait entre ses bras nus, souples comme des couleuvres, il s’attendait à la voir, tant elle était mince, s’enrouler à son corps, s’endormir là, collée à sa peau. C’était elle qui marchait en avant. Elle le conduisait par un sentier détourné, où ils s’attardaient, pour ne pas arriver trop vite. Elle lui donnait la passion de la terre. Il apprenait à l’aimer, en regardant comment s’aiment les herbes ; tendresse longtemps tâtonnante, et dont un soir enfin ils avaient surpris la grande joie, sous l’arbre géant, dans l’ombre suant la sève. Là, ils étaient au bout de leur chemin. Albine, renversée, la tête roulée au milieu de ses cheveux, lui tendait les bras. Lui, la prenait d’une étreinte. Oh ! la prendre, la posséder encore, sentir son flanc tressaillir de fécondité, faire de la vie, être Dieu !","What, then, was he neglecting to be subjected to such harsh trials? He wiped the sweat that ran from his temples with his hand, he thought that he had made his examination of conscience again that morning, without finding any serious offense in him. Did he not lead a life of austerities and macerations? Did he not love God alone, blindly? Ah! that he would have blessed him, if he had at last restored his peace, judging him sufficiently punished for his fault. But perhaps this fault could never be expiated. And, in spite of himself, he returned to Albine, to Paradou, to burning memories. First, he made excuses. One evening, he fell on the floor of his room, struck down by a cerebral fever. For three weeks he belonged to this crisis of his flesh. His blood, furiously, washed his veins, to the end of his limbs, roared through him with the din of a released torrent; his body, from the skull to the soles of his feet, was cleansed, renewed, battered by such work of illness that often, in his delirium, he had thought he heard the hammers of the workmen re-nailing his bones. Then he woke up one morning like new. He was born a second time, rid of what twenty-five years of life had successively deposited in him. His childhood devotions, his seminary education, his faith as a young priest, had all gone, submerged, swept away, leaving the place clear. Certainly, hell alone had thus prepared him for sin, disarming him, making his entrails a bed of softness, where evil could enter and sleep. And he, remained unconscious, abandoned himself to this slow journey towards the fault. At Paradou, when he opened his eyes, he felt bathed in childhood, with no memory of the past, no longer having anything of the priesthood. His organs had a gentle play, a rapture of surprise, in starting life over again, as if they did not know it and were extremely happy to learn it. Oh ! delicious learning, charming encounters, adorable reunions! This Paradou was a great bliss. By putting him there, hell knew he would be defenseless there. Never, in his early youth, had he tasted the growth of such voluptuousness. This early youth, if he evoked it now, seemed to him all black, spent far from the sun, ungrateful, pale, infirm. Also how he had greeted the sun, how he had marveled at the first tree, the first flower, the smallest insect seen, the smallest pebble picked up! The stones themselves charmed him. The horizon was an extraordinary wonder. His senses, a clear morning with which his eyes filled, an odor of jasmine inhaled, the song of a lark listened to, caused him such strong emotions that his limbs fainted. He had taken a long pleasure in teaching himself even to the slightest thrills of life. And the morning Albine was born, by his side, among the roses! He was still laughing in ecstasy at the memory. She was rising like a star necessary to the sun itself. She clarified everything, explained everything. She was finishing it. So he began their walks with her again, to the four corners of Paradou. He remembered the little hair that flew on the back of her neck when she ran in front of him. She smelled good, she swung warm skirts, the rustling of which resembled caresses. When she took him in her bare arms, supple as snakes, he expected to see her, so thin she was, curl up around his body, fall asleep there, glued to his skin. She was the one walking ahead. She led him by a circuitous path, where they lingered, so as not to arrive too quickly. She gave him a passion for the land. He learned to love it, by watching how the herbs love each other; a long groping tenderness, the great joy of which they had finally surprised one evening, under the giant tree, in the shade sweating the sap. There, they were at the end of their road. Albine, thrown back, her head rolled up in her hair, held out her arms to him. He took her in a hug. Oh ! to take it, to possess it again, to feel its side quivering with fruitfulness, to make life, to be God!","What, then, had he failed to do, to be subjected to such severe trials? He wiped away with his hand the sweat that flowed from his brow; and reflected that only that morning he had examined his conscience without finding any serious offence. Was he not leading a life of austerity and mortifications? Did he not love God solely and blindly? Oh, how he would have blessed him, if he had at last granted him peace, judging him sufficiently punished for his sin. But perhaps that sin could never be expiated. And in spite of himself, his thoughts returned to Albine, to the Paradou, and to his burning memories. At first, he tried to find excuses for himself. One evening, he had fallen on the tiled floor of his room, struck down by a brain fever. For three weeks he had been taken over by this physical crisis. His raging blood had washed his veins even to the ends of his limbs, and roared through him with a noise like a torrent unleashed; his body, from the tip of his head to the soles of his feet, had been scoured, renewed, and battered by such a great labour of illness that often, in his delirium, he had thought he could hear the hammers of workers nailing his limbs back together. Then one morning, he had awakened as a new man. It was like a second birth, freed from everything that twenty-five years of life had gradually deposited in him. His devotions as a child, his education at the seminary, his innocent faith as a young priest, everything had gone, submerged, swept away, leaving an empty space. Surely only hell could have thus prepared him for sin, disarming him, making his body a bed of softness into which sin could enter and sleep. And he, in his ignorance, had abandoned himself to the slow slide towards sin. When he opened his eyes in the Paradou, he had felt bathed in a new childhood, with no memory of the past, no trace of the priesthood. His organs had played a sweet game, delighted and surprised at starting life anew, as if they did not know what life was, and thought it the greatest possible joy to find out. Oh! such a delightful apprenticeship, such charming encounters, such adorable discoveries! That Paradou was a huge happiness. In placing him there, hell knew very well he would be defenceless. Never, during his first youth, had he tasted such pleasure in growing up. That first youth, if he recalled it now, seemed to him to be entirely dark, an unlovely time, pallid and sickly, spent without any sunshine. So how he had greeted the sun, how he had marvelled at the first tree he saw, the first flower, the tiniest insect perceived, the smallest pebble picked up! The very stones had enchanted him. The horizon was an amazing miracle. With a bright morning shining in his eyes, the scent of jasmine in his nostrils, the song of a lark in his ears, his senses had aroused emotions so strong that his limbs gave way beneath him. He had taken pleasure in slowly learning about the slightest quiverings of life. And that morning when Albine came into being at his side, among the roses! He still laughed with ecstasy at that memory. She rose like a star that was necessary to the sun itself. She lit up everything, explained everything. She completed him. Then he began to go over again their walks to the four corners of the Paradou. He remembered the little hairs that fluttered on her neck when she ran in front of him. She smelled good, and as her warm skirts swung as she walked, their rustling was like a caress. When she took him in her bare arms, supple as snakes, he quite expected to see her, slender as she was, curl up on his body and fall asleep pressed to his skin. It was she who led the way. She had taken him along a winding path on which they lingered, not wanting to arrive too soon. She had given him a passion for the earth. He learned to love her by seeing how the plants love each other; it was a love groping its way along for some time, but whose great joy they had one evening discovered, under the giant tree in the sap-filled shade. There, they had reached the end of their journey. Albine, lying down with her head lolling back among her loosened hair, held out her arms to him. He took her in his embrace. Oh! to take her, possess her, once more to feel her body tremble with fecundity, to create life, to be God!","But what had he omitted to do that he was thus so sorely tried? With his hand he wiped away the perspiration that streamed down his brow, and reflected that, that very morning, he had made his usual self-examination without finding any great guilt within him. Was he not leading a life of great austerity and mortification of the flesh? Did he not love God solely and blindly? Ah! how he would have blessed His Holy Name had He only restored him his peace, deeming him now sufficiently punished for his transgression! But, perhaps, that sin of his could never be expiated. And then, in spite of himself, his mind reverted to Albine and the Paradou, and all their memories. At first he tried to make excuses for himself. He had fallen, one evening, senseless upon the tiled floor of his bedroom, stricken with brain fever. For three weeks he had remained unconscious. His blood surged furiously through his veins and raged within him like a torrent that had burst its banks. His whole body, from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet, was so scoured and renewed and wrought afresh by the mighty labouring of his ailment, that in his delirium he had sometimes thought he could hear the very hammer blows of workmen that nailed his bones together again. Then, one morning, he had awakened, feeling like a new being. He was born a second time, freed of all that his five-and-twenty years of life had successively implanted in him. His childish piety, his education at the seminary, the faith of his early priesthood, had all vanished, had been carried off, and their place was bare and empty. In truth, it could be hell alone that had thus prepared him for the reception of evil, disarming him of all his former weapons, and reducing his body to languor and softness, through which sin might readily enter. He, perfectly unconscious of it all, unknowingly surrendered himself to the gradual approach of evil. When he had reopened his eyes in the Paradou, he had felt himself an infant once more, with no memory of the past, no knowledge of his priesthood. He experienced a gentle pleasure, a glad feeling of surprise at thus beginning life afresh, as though it were all new and strange to him and would be delightful to learn. Oh! the sweet apprenticeship, the charming observations, the delicious discoveries! That Paradou was a vast abode of felicity; and hell, in placing him there, had known full well that he would be defenceless. Never, in his first youth, had he known such enjoyment in growing. That first youth of his, when he now thought of it, seemed quite black and gloomy, graceless, wan and inactive, as if it had been spent far away from the sunlight. But at the Paradou, how joyfully had he hailed the sun! How admiringly had he gazed at the first tree, at the first flower, at the tiniest insect he had seen, at the most insignificant pebble he had picked up! The very stones charmed him. The horizon was a source of never-ending amazement. One clear morning, the memory of which still filled his eyes, bringing back a perfume of jasmine, a lark's clear song, he had been so affected by emotion that he felt all power desert his limbs. He had long found pleasure in learning the sensations of life. And, ah! the morning when Albine had been born beside him amidst the roses! As he thought of it, an ecstatic smile broke out upon his face. She rose up like a star that was necessary to the very sun's existence. She illumined everything, she made everything clear. She made his life complete. Then in fancy he once again walked with her through the Paradou. He remembered the little curls that waved behind her neck as she ran on before him. She exhaled delicious scent, and the touch of her warm swaying skirts seemed like a caress. And when she clasped him with her supple curving arms, he half expected to see her, so slight and slender she was, twine herself around him. It was she who went foremost. She led him through winding paths, where they loitered, that their walk might last the longer. It was she who instilled into him love for nature; and it was by watching the loves of the plants that he had learned to love her, with a love that was long, indeed, in bursting into life, but whose sweetness had been theirs at last. Beneath the shade of the giant tree they had reached their journey's goal. Oh! to clasp her once again—yet once again!"
"Albine, effrontément, riait plus fort. Le docteur Pascal, qui était son grand ami, se laissa embrasser par elle.","Albine brazenly laughed louder. Doctor Pascal, who was her great friend, let her kiss him.","Albine, quite unperturbed, only laughed louder. Dr Pascal, a great friend of hers, allowed himself to be kissed by her.","Albine remained unabashed, however, and laughed still more heartily. Doctor Pascal, who was her great friend, let her kiss him."
"L’abbé fit encore quelques pas, la tête penchée ; puis, il jeta les fleurs dans le trou au fumier, par-dessus la claire-voie.","The abbé took a few more steps, his head bowed; then he threw the flowers into the manure hole, over the skylight.","The abbé walked on a few steps with bowed head, then threw the flowers over the gate into the compost heap.","The Abbe took a few steps more, with downcast head; and then over the palings he flung the flowers upon a manure-heap."
— Ce sont des amours ! balbutiait-elle.,- They are loves! she stammered.,‘What little darlings they are!’ she stammered.,'What little loves they are!' she stammered.
"— Reste, ne sors plus, lui dit-il à mains jointes, un matin qu’il la voyait essoufflée encore de la veille. Tu me désespères.","""Stay, don't go out,"" he said to her with joined hands, one morning when he saw her still out of breath from the night before. You despair me.","‘Stay here, don’t go out any more,’ he begged her with clasped hands one morning, when he saw how breathless she still was from the day before. ‘You’re driving me to despair.’","'Stay indoors, and don't go out,' he begged her, with clasped hands, one morning when he saw her still unrecovered from the fatigue of the previous day. ' You drive me to despair.'"
"— Quand j’étais plus jeune, elles me faisaient peur, murmura Albine. Vois-les donc. Ne dirait-on pas des milliers de petits visages qui vous regardent, à ras de terre ?… Et elles tournent leurs figures, toutes ensemble. On dirait des poupées enterrées qui passent la tête.","""When I was younger, they scared me,"" murmured Albine. See them then. Wouldn't it look like thousands of little faces looking at you, low to the ground?... And they turn their faces, all together. They look like buried dolls sticking their heads out.","‘When I was younger, they used to frighten me,’ Albine murmured. ‘ Just look at them, aren’t they like thousands of little faces looking up at us from the ground? And they all turn their faces the same way. They’re like buried dolls, sticking their heads out.’","When I was younger they used to make me quite afraid,' murmured Albine. ' Look at them. Wouldn't you think that they were thousands of little faces looking up at you from the ground? And they turn, too, all in the same direction. They might be a lot of buried dolls thrusting their heads out of the ground.'"
"Albine et Serge se perdaient. Mille plantes, de tailles plus hautes, bâtissaient des haies, ménageaient des sentiers étroits qu’ils se plaisaient à suivre. Les sentiers s’enfonçaient avec de brusques détours, s’embrouillaient, emmêlaient des bouts de taillis inextricables : des ageratums à houppettes bleu céleste ; des aspérules, d’une délicate odeur de musc ; des mimulus, montrant des gorges cuivrées, ponctuées de cinabre ; des phlox écarlates, des phlox violets, superbes, dressant des quenouilles de fleurs que le vent filait ; des lins rouges aux brins fins comme des cheveux ; des chrysanthèmes pareils à des lunes pleines, des lunes d’or, dardant de courts rayons éteints, blanchâtres, violâtres, rosâtres.","Albine and Serge were lost. A thousand plants, of taller heights, built hedges, arranged narrow paths which they liked to follow. The paths sank in with sudden detours, became confused, entangled bits of inextricable coppice: celestial blue puffed ageratums; woodruff, with a delicate smell of musk; mimulus, showing coppery throats, punctuated with cinnabar; scarlet phloxes, violet phloxes, superb, raising cattails of flowers that the wind swept; red linens with fine strands like hair; chrysanthemums like full moons, golden moons, darting short, extinguished rays, whitish, purplish, pinkish.","Albine and Serge were getting lost. Hundreds of much taller plants created hedges and offered narrow paths that they enjoyed following. The paths plunged on with sudden twists and turns, ran into each other, and merged into inextricable thickets; ageratums with their sky-blue tufts of flowers; sweet woodruffs with their delicate musky odour; mimulus flowers with brazen throats, splashed with vermilion; scarlet phlox and purple phlox, proudly holding aloft their distaffs of flowers to be woven by the wind; red flax with sprigs as fine as hair; chrysanthemums like full moons, moons of gold, giving off brief, dim rays of white and purple and pink.","Albine and Serge quite lost themselves. Thousands of loftier plants towered up in hedges around them, enclosing narrow paths which they found it delightful to thread. These paths twisted and turned, wandered maze-like through dense thickets. There were ageratums with sky-blue tufts of bloom; woodruffs with soft musky perfume; brazen-throated mimuluses, blotched with bright vermilion; lofty phloxes, crimson and violet, throwing up distaffs of flowers for the breezes to spin; red flax with sprays as fine as hair; chrysanthemums like full golden moons, casting short faint rays, white and violet and rose, around them."
"— Veux-tu que j’ouvre les rideaux ? demanda Albine, trompée par la fixité de son regard.","""Do you want me to open the curtains?"" asked Albine, deceived by the fixity in her gaze.","‘Do you want me to open the curtains?’ asked Albine, misunderstanding his fixed stare.","'Would you like me to open the curtains?' asked Albine, misunderstanding his steady gaze."
"— Oh ! tu es guéri, maintenant, reprit-elle. Sais-tu que je pleurais, tout le long du chemin, lorsque je revenais de là-bas avec de mauvaises nouvelles. On me disait que tu avais le délire, que cette mauvaise fièvre, si elle te faisait grâce, t’emporterais la raison… Comme j’ai embrassé ton oncle Pascal, lorsqu’il t’a amené ici, pour ta convalescence !","- Oh ! you are cured now, she went on. Do you know that I was crying, all the way, when I came back from there with bad news. I was told that you were delirious, that this bad fever, if it spared you, would take your sanity away… How I kissed your uncle Pascal when he brought you here for your convalescence!","‘You’re much better now,’ she went on. ‘ Do you know, I used to cry all the way home when I came back from over there with bad news. They told me you were delirious, and even if that awful fever spared your life, you would still lose your reason. Oh! how I hugged your uncle Pascal, when he brought you here to convalesce.’","you are well now. Do you know, I used to cry the whole way home when I came back from over yonder with bad news of you.

"Il pleuvait là de larges gouttes de soleil. L’astre y triomphait, y prenait la terre nue, la serrait contre l’embrasement de sa poitrine. Dans l’étourdissement de la chaleur, Albine chancela, se tourna vers Serge.","It was raining large drops of sunshine there. The star triumphed there, took the bare earth there, pressed it against the conflagration of its chest. Stunned by the heat, Albine staggered, turned to Serge.","It was raining down huge splashes of sun. The orb was all-conquering, it took the naked earth and pressed it to its blazing breast. Dizzy with the heat, Albine staggered, and turned to Serge.","Where they stood the sun rays fell like torrential rain. It was as if the triumphant orb seized upon the shadowless ground, and strained it to his blazing breast. Albine grew faint, staggered, and turned to Serge for support."
"L’église, vide, était toute blanche, par cette matinée de mai. La corde, près du confessionnal, pendait de nouveau, immobile. La veilleuse, dans un verre de couleur, brûlait, pareille à une tache rouge, à droite du tabernacle, contre le mur. Vincent, après avoir porté les burettes sur la crédence, revint s’agenouiller à gauche, au bas du degré, tandis que le prêtre, ayant salué le Saint-Sacrement d’une génuflexion sur le pavé, montait à l’autel et étalait le corporal, au milieu duquel il plaçait le calice. Puis, ouvrant le Missel, il redescendit. Une nouvelle génuflexion le plia ; il se signa à voix haute, joignit les mains devant la poitrine, commença le grand drame divin, d’une face toute pâle de foi et d’amour.","The empty church was all white on this May morning. The rope near the confessional hung motionless again. The pilot light, in a colored glass, was burning, like a red stain, to the right of the tabernacle, against the wall. Vincent, after carrying the cruets to the credenza, returned to kneel on the left, at the bottom of the step, while the priest, having saluted the Blessed Sacrament with a genuflexion on the pavement, went up to the altar and spread out the corporal, in the middle of which he placed the chalice. Then, opening the Missal, he descended. A new genuflexion bent him; he crossed himself aloud, joined his hands in front of his chest, began the great divine drama, with a face quite pale with faith and love.","The church, quite empty, was all white on this May morning. The bell rope hanging by the confessional was now still. The night light, in a coloured glass, was casting a patch of red on the wall to the right of the tabernacle. * Vincent, after carrying the cruets to the credenza, went back and knelt on the left, on the bottom step, while the priest, after a deep genuflexion to the Host, went up to the altar and spread out the corporal, in the centre of which he placed the chalice. Now, opening the Missal, he went back down. After another deep genuflexion, he made the sign of the cross, saying the words aloud, then joined his hands together on his breast, and began the great divine drama, his face pale with faith and love.","The empty church was quite white that May morning. The bell-rope near the confessional hung motionless once more. The little bracket light, with its stained glass shade, burned like a crimson splotch against the wall on the right of the tabernacle. Vincent, having set the cruets on the credence, came back and knelt just below the altar step on the left, while the priest, after rendering homage to the Holy Sacrament by a genuflexion, went up to the altar and there spread out the corporal, on the centre of which he placed the chalice. Then, having opened the Missal, he came down again. Another bend of the knee followed, and, after crossing himself and uttering aloud the formula, 'In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,' he raised his joined hands to his breast, and entered on the great divine drama, with his countenance blanched by faith and love."

"Serge l’emmena à pas lents. Lui, largement, regarda l’arbre une dernière fois. Il le remerciait. L’ombre devenait plus noire dans la clairière ; un frisson de femme surprise à son coucher tombait des verdures. Quand ils revirent, au sortir des feuillages, le soleil, dont la splendeur emplissait encore un coin de l’horizon, ils se rassurèrent, Serge surtout, qui trouvait à chaque être, à chaque plante, un sens nouveau. Autour de lui, tout s’inclinait, tout apportait un hommage à son amour. Le jardin n’était plus qu’une dépendance de la beauté d’Albine, et il semblait avoir grandi, s’être embelli, dans le baiser de ses maîtres.","Serge took her away slowly. He looked broadly at the tree one last time. He thanked him. The shadow grew darker in the clearing; a shiver of a woman surprised at her bedtime fell from the greenery. When they saw again, emerging from the foliage, the sun, whose splendor still filled a corner of the horizon, they were reassured, Serge above all, who found in each being, in each plant, a new meaning. Around him, everything bowed, everything brought homage to his love. The garden was no more than a dependency of Albine's beauty, and it seemed to have grown, to have grown more beautiful, in the kiss of its masters.","Serge slowly led her away. He gave one long, last look at the tree. He was thanking it. The shade was growing darker in the glade; a shudder like that of a woman surprised at her bedside ran through the greenery. When they emerged from the foliage and saw the sun again, its splendour still filling part of the horizon, they were reassured, especially Serge, who was finding a new meaning in every living creature and every plant. Around him, everything bowed, everything paid homage to his love. The garden was no more than an offshoot of the beauty of Albine, and it seemed to have grown and become more beautiful through the embracing of its masters.","Serge led her thence, pacing slowly and giving one last glance at the spot which love had hallowed. The shadows in the clearing were growing darker, and a gentle quiver coursed through the foliage. When they emerged from the wood and caught sight of the sun, still shining brightly in the horizon, they felt easier. Everything around Serge now seemed to bend down before him and pay homage to his love. The garden was now nothing but an appanage of Albine's beauty, and seemed to have grown larger and fairer amid the love-kisses of its rulers."
"Il jeta à son cheval un léger claquement de la langue, et continua à parler tout seul, pendant que le cabriolet descendait la pente.","He gave his horse a slight click of his tongue, and continued to talk to himself, while the cabriolet descended the slope.","He clucked his tongue at the horse, and went on talking to himself as the gig rolled down the slope:","He set his horse off with a cluck of his tongue, and continued talking to himself as the gig rattled down the hill."
"— Si, je t’aime. J’ai beaucoup souffert, l’autre jour, après t’avoir renvoyée… Oh ! je t’aimais avec un tel emportement, sais-tu, que je t’aurais brisée d’une étreinte, si tu étais revenue te jeter dans mes bras. Jamais je ne t’ai désirée si furieusement. Pendant des heures, tu es restée vivante devant moi, me tenaillant de tes doigts souples.

"Le pays s’étendait à deux lieues, fermé par un mur de collines jaunes, que des bois de pins tachaient de noir ; pays terrible aux landes séchées, aux arêtes rocheuses déchirant le sol. Les quelques coins de terre labourable étalaient des mares saignantes, des champs rouges, où s’alignaient des files d’amandiers maigres, des têtes grises d’oliviers, des traînées de vignes, rayant la campagne de leurs souches brunes. On aurait dit qu’un immense incendie avait passé là, semant sur les hauteurs les cendres des forêts, brûlant les prairies, laissant son éclat et sa chaleur de fournaise dans les creux. À peine, de loin en loin, le vert pâle d’un carré de blé mettait-il une note tendre. L’horizon restait farouche, sans un filet d’eau, mourant de soif, s’envolant par grandes poussières aux moindres haleines. Et, tout au bout, par un coin écroulé des collines de l’horizon, on apercevait un lointain de verdures humides, une échappée de la vallée voisine, que fécondait la Viorme, une rivière descendue des gorges de la Seille.","The country extended two leagues, enclosed by a wall of yellow hills, which the pine woods stained with black; terrible country with dried moors, rocky ridges tearing the ground. The few corners of arable land spread out bleeding pools, red fields, lined with lines of thin almond trees, gray tops of olive trees, trails of vines, streaking the countryside with their brown stumps. It looked as if an immense fire had passed there, scattering the ashes of the forests on the heights, burning the meadows, leaving its brilliance and its furnace heat in the hollows. Hardly, from time to time, did the pale green of a square of wheat set a tender note. The horizon remained wild, without a trickle of water, dying of thirst, flying away in great dust at the slightest breath. And, at the far end, through a crumbled corner of the hills on the horizon, one could see a distance of damp greenery, an escape from the neighboring valley, fertilized by the Viorme, a river descending from the gorges of the Seille.","The countryside stretched away for six miles or so, bounded by a wall of yellow hills, dappled with the black of pinewoods; a terrible landscape of dry moors with rocky outcrops thrusting through the ground. The few patches of arable land were like pools of blood, red fields with long lines of scraggy almond trees, olive trees with their grizzled heads, and fields of vines that streaked the ground with their dark stocks. It was as if a huge fire had passed that way, scattering the ashes of forests over the high ground, burning up the plains, and leaving its glare and blazing heat in the hollows. Only here and there, far off, did the pale green of a cornfield offer a gentler note. The horizon was totally inhospitable, with no trickle of water; it was dying of thirst, and flew into clouds of dust at the slightest breeze. And in the distance one could see, through a gap in the hills along the horizon, a distant prospect of well-watered greenery, a glimpse of the neighbouring valley, made fertile by the Viorne, a river flowing from the gorges of the Seine.","The countryside stretched away for a distance of six miles, bounded by a wall of tawny hills speckled with black pine-woods. It was a fearful landscape of arid wastes and rocky spurs rending the soil. The few patches of arable ground were like scattered pools of blood, red fields with rows of lean almond trees, grey-topped olive trees and long lines of vines, streaking the soil with their brown stems. It was as if some huge conflagration had swept by there, scattering the ashes of forests over the hill-tops, consuming all the grass of the meadow lands, and leaving its glare and furnace-like heat behind in the hollows. Only here and there was the softer note of a pale green patch of growing corn. The landscape generally was wild, lacking even a threadlet of water, dying of thirst, and flying away in clouds of dust at the least breath of wind. But at the farthest point where the crumbling hills on the horizon had left a breach one espied some distant fresh moist greenery, a stretch of the neighbouring valley fertilised by the Viorne, a river flowing down from the gorges of the Seille."
"La pluie, au-dehors, tombait plus fine. Une nappe de soleil, échappée du coin d’un nuage, trempait d’or la poussière d’eau volante. Albine, restée immobile, regardait dormir Désirée, cette belle fille qui contentait sa chair en se roulant sur la paille. Elle souhaitait d’être ainsi lasse et pâmée, endormie de jouissance, pour quelques fétus qui lui auraient chatouillé la nuque. Elle jalousait ces bras forts, cette poitrine dure, cette vie toute charnelle dans la chaleur fécondante d’un troupeau de bêtes, cet épanouissement purement animal, qui faisait de l’enfant grasse la tranquille sœur de la grande vache blanche et rousse. Elle rêvait d’être aimée du coq fauve et d’aimer elle-même comme les arbres poussent, naturellement, sans honte, en ouvrant chacune de ses veines aux jets de la sève. C’était la terre qui assouvissait Désirée, lorsqu’elle se vautrait sur le dos. Cependant, la pluie avait complètement cessé. Les trois chats de la maison, l’un derrière l’autre, filaient dans la cour, le long du mur, en prenant des précautions infinies pour ne pas se mouiller. Ils allongèrent le cou dans l’écurie, ils vinrent droit à la dormeuse, ronronnant, se couchant contre elle, les pattes sur un peu de sa peau. Moumou, le gros chat noir, blotti près d’une de ses joues, se mit à lui lécher le menton avec douceur.","The rain outside was falling thinner. A sheet of sunlight, escaping from the corner of a cloud, drenched the dust of flying water with gold. Albine, remaining motionless, watched Désirée sleeping, that beautiful girl who contented her flesh by rolling on the straw. She wanted to be so tired and swooned, asleep with pleasure, for a few straws that would have tickled the back of her neck. She was jealous of those strong arms, that hard chest, that wholly carnal life in the fertilizing warmth of a herd of animals, that purely animal blossoming which made the fat child the quiet sister of the big white and red cow. She dreamed of being loved by the wild cock and of loving herself as trees grow, naturally, without shame, opening each of her veins to the jets of sap. It was the earth that satisfied Désirée when she sprawled on her back. However, the rain had stopped completely. The three cats of the house, one behind the other, scurried about in the yard, along the wall, taking infinite precautions not to get wet. They stretched their necks in the stable, they came straight to the sleeper, purring, lying against her, their paws on a little of her skin. Moumou, the big black cat, nestled close to one of his cheeks, began to lick his chin gently.","The rain outside was now much lighter. A patch of sunshine, escaping from the corner of a cloud, spattered the mist of flying raindrops with gold. Albine, keeping quite still, looked at Désirée sleeping, this handsome girl who satisfied her flesh by rolling in the straw. She wished she could be exhausted and swooning like that, lulled to sleep with pleasure, just through a few bits of straw tickling her neck. She envied those strong arms, that firm breast, that totally physical life in the fertile warmth of a herd of farmyard animals, that purely animal blossoming that made the plump child a tranquil sister of the big brown-and-white cow. She dreamed of being loved by a tawny rooster, and herself loving naturally, the way the trees grow, without shame, opening each of her veins to the spurts of sap. It was the earth that satisfied Désirée, when she lay down on her back. Meanwhile, the rain had completely stopped. The three cats of the household were walking along one after the other beside the wall in the yard, with infinite precautions to avoid getting wet. They poked their heads into the stable and came straight to the sleeping girl, purring, and lay down beside her, with their paws on a bit of her skin. Moumou, the big black cat, huddled up against one of her cheeks, and began gently licking her chin.","Outside, the rain was falling less heavily. A sunbeam, escaping from beneath a cloud, gilded the fine drops of water. Albine, who had remained perfectly still, watched the slumber of Desiree, that big, plump girl who found her great delight in rolling about in the straw. She wished that she, too, could slumber away so peacefully, and feel such pleasure, because a few straws had tickled her neck. And she felt jealous of those strong arms, that firm bosom, all that vitality, all that purely animal development which made the other like a tranquil easy-minded sister of the big red and white cow. However, the rain had now quite ceased. The three cats of the parsonage filed out into the yard one after the other, keeping close to the wall, and taking the greatest precautions to avoid wetting their paws. They peeped into the stable, and then stalked up to the sleeping girl, and lay down, purring, close by her. Moumou, the big black cat, curled itself up close to her cheek, and gently licked her chin."
"L’abbé Mouret voulut intervenir. Mais la Teuse demanda si on se moquait d’elle, à lui laisser si longtemps les bras en l’air. Et elle attacha solidement la branche d’olivier, pendant que Catherine, grimpée sur l’escabeau, derrière son dos, contre-faisait la façon pénible dont elle tournait sa taille énorme, à l’aide de sa bonne jambe ; ce qui fit sourire le prêtre lui-même.","Father Mouret wanted to intervene. But La Teuse asked if they were making fun of her, leaving her arms in the air for so long. And she fastened the olive branch firmly, while Catherine, climbing on the stool behind her back, counteracted the painful way in which she bent her enormous figure with the help of her good leg; which made the priest himself smile.","The abbé tried to intervene. But La Teuse asked what they thought they were doing, leaving her for so long with her arms up in the air. And she firmly attached the olive branch to the altar, while Catherine, who had climbed on to the steps behind her back, imitated the awkward way in which she used her good leg to manoeuvre her large bulk around; and the priest himself had to smile.","Abbe Mouret was about to intervene, but La Teuse sharply inquired if they wanted to make game of her and keep her arms up there all night. At last she proceeded to fasten the olive bough firmly, while Catherine, holding on to the steps behind her, mimicked the clumsy manner in which she turned her huge person about with the help of her sound leg. Even the priest could not forbear to smile."
"Lui, gardait toute l’ombre morte du séminaire. Pendant des années, il n’avait pas connu le soleil. Il l’ignorait même encore, les yeux fermés, fixés sur l’âme, n’ayant que du mépris pour la nature damnée. Longtemps, aux heures de recueillement, lorsque la méditation le prosternait, il avait rêvé un désert d’ermite, quelque trou dans une montagne, où rien de la vie, ni être, ni plante, ni eau, ne le viendrait distraire de la contemplation de Dieu. C’était un élan d’amour pur, une horreur de la sensation physique. Là, mourant à lui-même, le dos tourné à la lumière, il aurait attendu de n’être plus, de se perdre dans la souveraine blancheur des âmes. Le ciel lui apparaissait tout blanc, d’un blanc de lumière, comme s’il neigeait des lis, comme si toutes les puretés, toutes les innocences, toutes les chastetés flambaient. Mais son confesseur le grondait, quand il lui racontait ses désirs de solitude, ses besoins de candeur divine ; il le rappelait aux luttes de l’Église, aux nécessités du sacerdoce. Plus tard, après son ordination, le jeune prêtre était venu aux Artaud, sur sa propre demande, avec l’espoir de réaliser son rêve d’anéantissement humain. Au milieu de cette misère, sur ce col stérile, il pourrait se boucher les oreilles aux bruits du monde, il vivrait dans le sommeil des saints. Et, depuis plusieurs mois, en effet, il demeurait souriant ; à peine un frisson du village le troublait-il de loin en loin ; à peine une morsure plus chaude du soleil le prenait-elle à la nuque, lorsqu’il suivait les sentiers, tout au ciel, sans entendre l’enfantement continu au milieu duquel il marchait.","He kept all the dead shadow of the seminary. For years he had not known the sun. He didn't even know it yet, his eyes closed, fixed on the soul, having only contempt for the damned nature. For a long time, during hours of meditation, when meditation prostrated him, he had dreamed of a hermit's desert, some hole in a mountain, where nothing in life, neither being, nor plant, nor water, would come to distract him from contemplation. of God. It was a surge of pure love, a horror of physical sensation. There, dying to himself, his back turned to the light, he would have waited to be no more, to lose himself in the sovereign whiteness of souls. The sky appeared to him all white, white with light, as if lilies were snowing, as if all purity, all innocence, all chastity were ablaze. But his confessor scolded him when he told him of his desires for solitude, his needs for divine candor; he reminded him of the struggles of the Church, of the necessities of the priesthood. Later, after his ordination, the young priest had come to Les Artaud, at his own request, with the hope of realizing his dream of human annihilation. In the midst of this misery, on this sterile collar, he could cover his ears to the noises of the world, he would live in the sleep of the saints. And, for several months, in fact, he remained smiling; scarcely a shudder from the village troubled him from time to time; scarcely a warmer bite of the sun took him on the nape of the neck, when he followed the paths, high up in the sky, without hearing the continuous childbirth in the midst of which he walked.","As for the priest, the dead shadow of the seminary still hung over him. For many years he had not seen the sun. Even now he was unaware of it, his eyes closed, turned inward on the soul, with nothing but scorn for nature, damned as it was. For a long time, during his hours of reflection, when he lay prostrated in reverent meditation, he had dreamed of a hermit’s desert, some remote place in the mountains, where nothing living, no being, no plant, no water, could come to distract him from the contemplation of God. It was a surge of pure love, a horror of all physical sensation. There, dead to himself, turning his back on the light, he would have waited until he was no more, until he disappeared into the sovereign whiteness of the soul. Heaven seemed to him all white, a whiteness full of light, like a snowstorm of lilies, as if all purity, all innocence, all chastity blazed together. But his confessor reproved him when he told of his longings for solitude and his yearnings for Godlike innocence; he reminded him of the struggles of the Church and the duties of the priesthood. Later, after his ordination, the priest had come to Les Artaud at his own request, hoping to realize his dream of annihilating the human. In this wretched place, on this sterile ground, he would be able to close his ears to the sounds of the world and live in a saintly sleep. And for many months he had indeed been content; hardly any agitation from the village disturbed him; hardly had the sun’s hot bite snapped at his neck as he walked the lanes, his mind solely on Heaven, oblivious to the prolific fecundity all around him.","Over the priest the sombre shadows of seminary life still hovered. For years he had never seen the sun. He perceived it not even now, his eyes closed and gazing inwards on his soul, and with no feeling for perishable nature, fated to damnation, save contempt. For a long time in his hours of devout thought he had dreamt of some hermit's desert, of some mountain hole, where no living thing— neither being, plant, nor water—should distract him from the contemplation of God. It was an impulse springing from the purest love, from a loathing of all physical sensation. There, dying to self, and with his back turned to the light of day, he would have waited till he should cease to be, till nothing should remain of him but the sovereign whiteness of the soul. To him heaven seemed all white, with a luminous whiteness as if lilies there snowed down upon one, as if every form of purity, innocence, and chastity there blazed. But his confessor reproved him whenever he related his longings for solitude, his cravings for an existence of Godlike purity; and recalled him to the struggles of the Church, the necessary duties of the priesthood. Later on, after his ordination, the young priest had come to Les Artaud at his own request, there hoping to realise his dream of human annihilation. In that desolate spot, on that barren soil, he might shut his ears to all worldly sounds, and live the dreamy life of a saint. For some months past, in truth, his existence had been wholly undisturbed, rarely had any thrill of the village-life disturbed him; and even the sun's heat scarcely brought him any glow of feeling as he walked the paths, his whole being wrapped in heaven, heedless of the unceasing travail of life amidst which he moved."
"— Ah ! c’est trop bon, ça me fatigue tout de suite. La paille, ça donne sommeil, n’est-ce pas ?… Serge n’aime pas ça. Vous non plus, peut-être. Alors, qu’est-ce que vous pouvez aimer ?… Racontez un peu, pour que je sache.","- Oh! It's so good, it tires me right away. Straw makes you sleepy, doesn't it? Serge doesn't like it. Neither do you, perhaps. So, what can you like?… Tell a little, so that I know.","‘Oh! it’s too nice , it makes me feel tired straight away. Straw makes you sleepy, doesn’t it?... Serge doesn’t like that. Perhaps you don’t, either. So, what do you like, then?... Tell me, so I’ll know.’","'Ah! how pleasant it is,' she said; ' but then it makes me feel so sleepy. Straw always makes one drowsy, doesn't it? Serge doesn't like it. Perhaps you don't either. What do you like? Tell me, so that I may know.'"
"— Hein ! mon gros, tu leur as assez de fois volé leur soupe pour qu’elles te mangent un peu le cou maintenant.","- Eh ! Dude, you've stolen their soup enough times for them to eat your neck a little now.","‘Aha! my old fatty , you stole their food often enough, so now you can let them have a bit of your neck.’","And the girl stooped and patted the pig's plump belly, saying: 'Eh! my fat fellow, you have stolen their food too often to grudge them a wee bit of your neck now!'"
"Puis, sentant le bras de Serge qui la serrait plus nerveusement, elle ajouta :","Then, feeling Serge's arm squeezing her more nervously, she added:","Then, feeling Serge’s arm nervously tightening his grip, she added:","Then, on feeling Serge's arm tremble, she added: 'But perhaps I am mistaken. . . ."
"Le lendemain, le beau temps s’était gâté, il pleuvait. Serge, repris par la fièvre, passa une journée de souffrance, les yeux fixés désespérément sur les rideaux, d’où ne tombait qu’une lueur de cave, louche, d’un gris de cendre. Il ne devinait plus le soleil, il cherchait cette ombre dont il avait eu peur, cette branche haute qui, noyée dans la buée blafarde de l’averse, lui semblait avoir emporté la forêt en s’effaçant. Vers le soir, agité d’un léger délire, il cria en sanglotant à Albine que le soleil était mort, qu’il entendait tout le ciel, toute la campagne pleurer la mort du soleil. Elle dut le consoler comme un enfant, lui promettre le soleil, l’assurer qu’il reviendrait, qu’elle le lui donnerait. Mais il plaignait aussi les plantes. Les semences devaient souffrir sous le sol, à attendre la lumière ; elles avaient ses cauchemars, elles rêvaient qu’elles rampaient le long d’un souterrain, arrêtées par des éboulements, luttant furieusement pour arriver au soleil. Et il se mit à pleurer à voix plus basse, disant que l’hiver était une maladie de la terre, qu’il allait mourir en même temps que la terre, si le printemps ne les guérissait tous deux.","The next day, the good weather had deteriorated, it was raining. Serge, taken back by the fever, passed a day of suffering, his eyes fixed desperately on the curtains, from which fell only a gleam of cellar, suspicious, of an ash gray. He could no longer guess the sun, he was looking for that shadow he had been afraid of, that high branch which, drowned in the pallid mist of the downpour, seemed to him to have swept away the forest as it faded away. Towards evening, agitated by a slight delirium, he cried out sobbing to Albine that the sun was dead, that he heard the whole sky, the whole country weeping for the death of the sun. She had to comfort him like a child, promise him the sun, assure him that he would come back, that she would give it to him. But he also felt sorry for the plants. The seeds had to suffer under the ground, waiting for the light; they had his nightmares, they dreamed that they were crawling along an underground passage, stopped by landslides, struggling furiously to reach the sun. And he began to cry in a lower voice, saying that winter was a disease of the earth, that he was going to die with the earth, if the spring did not cure them both.","The next day the fine weather had gone, and it was raining. Serge, whose fever had returned, spent a day of suffering, with his eyes fixed despairingly on the curtains, from which came only a sinister light, cavern-like and grey as ash. He could no longer find the sun, and he looked for that shadow which had previously alarmed him, that high branch which, drowned now in the steamy haze of the rain, seemed to him, in its disappearance, to have carried the forest away with it. Towards evening, he became rather delirious, and sobbing, cried out to Albine that the sun had died and he could hear the whole sky and the whole countryside mourning the death of the sun. She had to comfort him like a child, promising him the sun, assuring him it would come back, and she would give it to him. But he was also grieving for the plants. The seeds must be suffering under the ground, waiting for the light; they must be having his nightmares, dreaming they were climbing along an underground tunnel, blocked by rockfalls, struggling madly to reach the sun. And he began to sob more quietly, saying that winter was an illness of the earth and he would die along with it, unless spring came and cured them both.","The fine weather broke up on the morrow, and it rained heavily. Serge's fever returned, and he spent a day of suffering, with his eyes despairingly fixed upon the curtains through which the light now fell dim and ashy grey as in a cellar. He could no longer see a trace of sunshine, and he looked in vain for the shadow that had scared him, the shadow of that lofty bough which had disappeared amid the mist and the pouring rain, and seemed to have carried away with it the whole forest. Towards evening he became slightly delirious and cried out to Albine that the sun was dead, that he could hear all the sky, all the country bewailing the death of the sun. She had to soothe him like a child, promising him the sun, telling him that it would come back again, that she would give it to him. But he also grieved for the plants. The seeds, he said, must be suffering underground, waiting for the return of light; they had nightmares, they also dreamed that they were crawling along an underground passage, hindered by mounds of ruins, struggling madly to reach the sunshine. And he began to weep and sob out in low tones that winter was a disease of the earth, and that he should die with the earth, unless the springtide healed them both."
"Et elle riait, plus sonore, avec des gammes perlées de petites notes de flûte, très aiguës, qui se noyaient dans un ralentissement de sons graves. C’était un rire sans fin, un roucoulement de gorge, une musique sonnante, triomphante, célébrant la volupté du réveil. Tout riait, dans ce rire de femme naissant à la beauté et à l’amour, les roses, le bois odorant, le Paradou entier. Jusque-là, il avait manqué un charme au grand jardin, une voix de grâce, qui fût la gaieté vivante des arbres, des eaux, du soleil. Maintenant, le grand jardin était doué de ce charme du rire.","And she laughed, more resonant, with pearly scales of small flute notes, very high-pitched, which were drowned in a slowing down of low sounds. It was endless laughter, a cooing of the throat, ringing, triumphant music, celebrating the voluptuousness of awakening. Everything laughed, in that woman's laughter born of beauty and love, the roses, the fragrant wood, the entire Paradou. Until then, the great garden had lacked a charm, a voice of grace, which was the living gaiety of the trees, the waters, the sun. Now the big garden was endowed with this charm of laughter.","And she laughed again, with even more resonance, with rippling scales of high flute-like notes, that sank slowly into deeper sounds. It was a laugh with no ending, a cooing of the throat, a sonorous, triumphant music, celebrating the joys of awakening. Everything laughed in this laugh of a woman newly born to love and beauty: the roses, the fragrant woods, the whole of the Paradou. Until now, the vast garden had been missing one charm, that of a graceful voice which would be the living gaiety of the trees, the streams, and the sun. Now the vast garden had been granted that charm of laughter.","Then she laughed yet more sonorously, pouring forth rippling scales of high-pitched, flute-like notes that melted into deeper ones. It was an endless laugh, a long-drawn cooing, then a burst of triumphant music celebrating the delight of awakening love. And everything—the roses, the fragrant wood, the whole of the Paradou—laughed in that laugh of woman just born to beauty and to love. Till now the vast garden had lacked one charm—a winning voice which should prove the living mirth of the trees, the streams, and the sunlight. Now the vast garden was endowed with that charm of laughter."

"— Allons, déguerpissez, maintenant, murmurait-elle. Vous êtes un tas de propres à rien, qui ne savez même pas respecter le bon Dieu… C’est une honte, ça ne s’est jamais vu, des filles qui se roulent par terre dans une église, comme des bêtes dans un pré… Qu’est-ce que tu fais là-bas, la Rousse ?

"À cette heure, l’abbé Mouret se rappelait encore le froid des ciseaux, lorsqu’on l’avait marqué de la tonsure, au commencement de sa première année de théologie. Il avait eu un léger frisson. Mais la tonsure était alors bien étroite, à peine ronde comme une pièce de deux sous. Plus tard, à chaque nouvel ordre reçu, elle avait grandi, toujours grandi, jusqu’à le couronner d’une tache blanche, aussi large qu’une grande hostie. Et l’orgue ronflait plus doucement, les encensoirs retombaient avec le bruit argentin de leurs chaînettes, en laissant échapper un flot de fumée blanche, qui se déroulait comme de la dentelle. Lui, se voyait en surplis, jeune tonsuré, amené à l’autel par le maître des cérémonies ; il s’agenouillait, baissait profondément la tête, tandis que l’évêque, avec des ciseaux d’or, lui coupait trois mèches de cheveux, une sur le front, les deux autres près des oreilles. À un an de là, il se voyait de nouveau, dans la chapelle pleine d’encens, recevant les quatre ordres mineurs : il allait, conduit par un archidiacre, fermer avec fracas la grande porte, qu’il rouvrait ensuite, pour montrer qu’il était commis à la garde des églises ; il secouait une clochette de la main droite, annonçant par là qu’il avait le devoir d’appeler les fidèles aux offices ; il revenait à l’autel, où l’évêque lui conférait de nouveaux privilèges, ceux de chanter les leçons, de bénir le pain, de catéchiser les enfants, d’exorciser le démon, de servir les diacres, d’allumer et d’éteindre les cierges. Puis, le souvenir de l’ordination suivante lui revenait, plus solennel, plus redoutable, au milieu du même chant des orgues, dont le roulement semblait être la foudre même de Dieu ; ce jour-là, il avait la dalmatique de sous-diacre aux épaules, il s’engageait à jamais par le vœu de chasteté, il tremblait de toute sa chair, malgré sa foi, au terrible : Accedite, de l’évêque, qui mettait en fuite deux de ses camarades, pâlissant à son côté ; ses nouveaux devoirs étaient de servir le prêtre à l’autel, de préparer les burettes, de chanter l’épître, d’essuyer le calice, de porter la croix dans les processions. Et, enfin, il défilait une dernière fois dans la chapelle, sous le rayonnement du soleil de juin ; mais, cette fois, il marchait en tête du cortège, il avait l’aube nouée à la ceinture, l’étole croisée sur la poitrine, la chasuble tombant du cou ; défaillant d’une émotion suprême, il apercevait la figure pâle de l’évêque qui lui donnait la prêtrise, la plénitude du sacerdoce, par une triple imposition des mains. Après son serment d’obéissance ecclésiastique, il se sentait comme soulevé des dalles, lorsque la voix pleine du prélat disait la phrase latine : « Accipe Spiritum sanctum : quorum remiseris peccata, remittuntur eis, et quorum retineris, retenta sunt. »","At this hour, the Abbe Mouret still remembered the cold of the scissors, when he had been branded with the tonsure, at the beginning of his first year of theology. He had a slight shiver. But the tonsure was then very narrow, barely round like a two-sou coin. Later, with each new order received, it had grown, always growing, until it crowned him with a white spot, as wide as a large host. And the organ snored more softly, the censers fell with the silvery noise of their chains, letting out a stream of white smoke, which unrolled like lace. He saw himself in a surplice, a tonsured youth, led to the altar by the master of ceremonies; he knelt down, lowered his head deeply, while the bishop, with golden scissors, cut off three locks of hair, one on the forehead, the other two near the ears. A year later, he saw himself again, in the chapel full of incense, receiving the four minor orders: he was going, led by an archdeacon, to close with a crash the great door, which he then reopened, to show that he was committed to the care of the churches; he shook a bell with his right hand, thereby announcing that it was his duty to call the faithful to offices; he returned to the altar, where the bishop conferred on him new privileges, those of singing the lessons, of blessing the bread, of catechizing the children, of exorcising the demon, of serving the deacons, of lighting and extinguish the candles. Then, the memory of the following ordination came back to him, more solemn, more formidable, amidst the same song of the organs, the rolling of which seemed to be the very thunderbolt of God; that day he had the dalmatic of a sub-deacon on his shoulders, he pledged himself forever by the vow of chastity, he trembled with all his flesh, despite his faith, at the terrible: Accedite, of the bishop, who put two of his comrades to flight, turning pale beside him; his new duties were to serve the priest at the altar, to prepare cruets, to sing the epistle, to wipe the chalice, to carry the cross in processions. And, finally, he paraded one last time in the chapel, under the radiance of the June sun; but this time he was walking at the head of the procession, he had his alb tied at his belt, the stole crossed over his chest, the chasuble falling from his neck; fainting with supreme emotion, he saw the pale face of the bishop who gave him the priesthood, the fullness of the priesthood, by a triple laying on of hands. After his oath of ecclesiastical obedience, he felt as if he had been lifted from the slabs, when the full voice of the prelate said the Latin phrase: “Accipe Spiritum sanctum: quorum miseris peccata, remittuntur eis, et quorum retineris, retenta sunt. »","Even now, Abbé Mouret could remember the cold chill of the scissors when he had been marked with the tonsure at the beginning of his first year of theology. It had given him a little shiver. But the tonsure then was very small, hardly the size of a twopenny piece. Later, it had grown bigger and bigger, with each new order, until he was crowned by a patch the size of a large Host. * The organ now grew softer, and the censers were swinging, their chains making a silvery sound, as they released a cloud of white smoke which unfurled in the air, like lace. He could see his newly tonsured self being brought to the altar by the master of ceremonies, then kneeling, with head bowed low, while the bishop, with gold scissors, cut off three strands of hair, one from his brow, and the two others close to his ears. He could see himself once more in the incense-filled chapel, a year later, receiving the four minor orders: led by an archdeacon, he went to the main door, which he closed with a bang, and then reopened, to show that he was entrusted with the guarding of churches; with his right hand he rang a little bell, thus declaring that he had the right to call the faithful to church; then back at the altar, the bishop conferred on him new privileges, that of chanting the lessons, of blessing the bread, catechizing children, exorcising the devil, serving the deacons, and lighting and extinguishing the candles. Then the memory of the following ordination returned to his mind, a more solemn and more frightening occasion, with the organ in full swing, and sounding like the very thunder of God; that day, he wore on his shoulders the dalmatic of a subdeacon, and he bound himself forever to the vow of chastity, and despite his faith, his whole body trembled at the bishop’s terrible ‘Accedite’,* which put to flight two of his comrades, who had turned pale at his side; his new duties included serving the priest at the altar, preparing the cruets, chanting the Epistle, wiping the chalice, and carrying the cross in processions. And now at last, he walked in procession one last time in the chapel, in the brilliance of the June sun; but this time he walked at the head of the procession, with the alb tied at his waist,* the stole across his breast, and the chasuble round his neck. Weak with extreme emotion, he could see the pale face of the bishop bestowing on him the priesthood in all its plenitude, with a triple laying-on of hands. After his vow of ecclesiastical obedience, he felt as if raised above the floor, when the resounding voice of the prelate spoke the Latin words: ‘Accipe Spiritum Sanctum: quorum remiseris peccata, remittuntur eis, et quorum retineris, retenta sunt.’ *","At this very hour Abbe Mouret could remember the chill of the scissors when he was marked with the tonsure at the beginning of his first year of theology. It had made him shudder slightly. But the tonsure had then been very small, hardly larger than a penny. Later, with each fresh order conferred on him, it had grown and grown until it crowned him with a white spot as large as a big Host. The organ's hum grew softer, and the censers swung with a silvery tinkling of their slender chains, releasing a cloudlet of white smoke, which unrolled in lacelike folds. He could see himself, a tonsured youth in a surplice, led to the altar by the master of ceremonies; there he knelt and bowed his head down low, while the bishop with golden scissors snipped off three locks—one over his forehead, and the other two near his ears. Yet another twelvemonth, and he could again see himself in the chapel amid the incense, receiving the four minor orders. Led by an archdeacon, he went to the main doorway, closed the door with a bang, and opened it again, to show that to him was entrusted the care of churches; next he rang a small bell with his right hand, in token that it was his duty to call the faithful to the divine offices; then he returned to the altar, where fresh privileges were conferred upon him by the bishop—those of singing the lessons, of blessing the bread, of catechising children, of exorcising evil spirits, of serving the deacons, of lighting and extinguishing the candles of the altars. Next came back the memory of the ensuing ordination, more solemn and more dread, amid the same organ strains which sounded now like God's own thunder: this time he wore a sub-deacon's dalmatic upon his shoulders, he bound himself for ever by the vow of chastity, he trembled in every pore, despite his faith, at the terrible Accedite from the bishop, which put to flight two of his companions, blanching by his side. His new duties were to serve the priest at the altar, to prepare the cruets, sing the epistle, wipe the chalice, and carry the cross in processions.

All but fainting from emotion, he could perceive the pallid face of the bishop giving him the priesthood, the fulness of the ministry, by the threefold laying of his hands. And after taking the oath of ecclesiastical obedience, he felt himself uplifted from the stone flags, when the prelate in a full voice repeated the Latin words: 'Accipe Spiritum Sanctum. . . . Quorum remiseris peccata, remittuntur eis, et quorum retinueris, retenta sunt. '—'Receive"
"— Enfin, elle t’a soigné, ajouta-t-il plus rudement. Sans elle, mon garçon, tu serais peut-être à cette heure dans un cabanon des Tulettes, avec la camisole de force aux épaules… Eh bien ! j’ai promis que tu irais la voir. Je t’emmène avec moi.

She wants to leave.","‘Anyway, she looked after you,’ he added more roughly. ‘If it weren’t for her, my boy, you would perhaps be in a cell in Les Tulettes,* with a straitjacket wrapped round your shoulders...

"— Tu as bien tort, reprit-elle. J’ai des œufs tout chauds. Je guettais les poules. Elles en ont fait quatorze, ce matin… Et nous aurions mangé un poulet, le blanc, celui qui bat les autres.

That is all.","She needs to be married.’ ‘Ah! so that’s what it’s about,’ muttered the old man, with a slightly mocking air. ‘ Thanks for the message, Monsieur le Curé. The Brichets sent you, didn’t they? Mother Brichet goes to Mass, and you’re helping her out with getting her son settled; that’s quite natural... But it’s no concern of mine. It doesn’t suit me, that’s all.’","'Oh, that's it, is it?' muttered the old man, with a bantering look. ' Many thanks for the message. The Brichets sent you, didn't they? Mother Brichet goes to mass, and so you give her a helping hand to marry her son—it's all very fine. But, I've got nothing to do with that. It doesn't suit me. That's all.'"
"Maintenant, elle était la servante. Elle renversait la tête sur son épaule, le regardant d’un air de reconnaissance inquiète. Ne lui en voudrait-il jamais de ce qu’elle l’avait amené là ? Ne lui reprocherait-il pas un jour cette heure d’adoration dans laquelle il s’était dit son esclave ?","Now she was the servant. She leaned her head on his shoulder, looking at him with an air of worried recognition. Would he ever blame her for bringing him there?

"Albine et Serge restaient ravis. Dès que l’arbre les eut pris sous la douceur de ses branches, ils se sentirent guéris de l’anxiété intolérable dont ils avaient souffert. Ils n’éprouvaient plus cette peur qui les faisait se fuir, ces luttes chaudes, désespérées, dans lesquelles ils se meurtrissaient, sans savoir contre quel ennemi ils résistaient si furieusement. Au contraire, une confiance absolue, une sérénité suprême les emplissaient ; ils s’abandonnaient l’un à l’autre, glissant lentement au plaisir d’être ensemble, très loin, au fond d’une retraite miraculeusement cachée. Sans se douter encore de ce que le jardin exigeait d’eux, ils le laissaient libre de disposer de leur tendresse ; ils attendaient, sans trouble, que l’arbre leur parlât. L’arbre les mettait dans un aveuglement d’amour tel, que la clairière disparaissait, immense, royale, n’ayant plus qu’un bercement d’odeur.","Albine and Serge remained delighted. As soon as the tree had taken them under the softness of its branches, they felt cured of the intolerable anxiety from which they had suffered. They no longer felt that fear which made them flee from each other, those hot, desperate struggles in which they bruised each other, without knowing against what enemy they were resisting so furiously. On the contrary, an absolute confidence, a supreme serenity filled them; they abandoned themselves to each other, slowly slipping into the pleasure of being together, far away, at the bottom of a miraculously hidden retreat. Without as yet suspecting what the garden demanded of them, they left him free to dispose of their tenderness; they waited, undisturbed, for the tree to speak to them. The tree put them in such a blindness of love that the clearing disappeared, immense, royal, with nothing left but a lulling scent.","Albine and Serge stood there in rapture. As soon as the tree had taken them into the sweetness of its branches, they felt cured of the intolerable anxiety they had been enduring. They were no longer subject to the fear that had made them avoid each other, the hot and desperate struggles in which they hurt each other without knowing what enemy they were resisting with such fury. Now, on the contrary, they were filled with an absolute confidence, a supreme serenity; they gave themselves freely to each other, slipping slowly into the pleasure of being together, far away, deep inside a miraculously hidden hideaway. Not knowing yet what the garden was asking of them, they left it free to dispose of their love as it would; they waited, untroubled, for the tree to speak to them. The tree held them in such a blindness of love that the glade, immense and royal, disappeared, leaving nothing but a cradling of fragrance.","Albine and Serge stood there in an ecstasy of joy. As soon as the tree had received them beneath its shade, they felt eased of all the anxious disquiet which had so long distressed them. The fears which had made them avoid each other, the fierce wrestling of spirit which had torn and wounded them, without consciousness on their part of what they were really contending against, vanished, and left them in perfect peace. Absolute confidence, supreme serenity, now pervaded them, they yielded unhesitatingly to the joy of being together in that lonely nook, so completely hidden from the outside world. They had surrendered themselves to the garden, they awaited in all calmness the behests of that tree of life. It enveloped them in such ecstasy of love that the whole clearing seemed to disappear from before their eyes, and to leave them wrapped in an atmosphere of perfume."

"Un grand frisson parut passer dans l’église. Le prêtre, effaré, redevenu d’une pâleur mortelle, écoutait. Qui donc avait parlé ? Qui avait blasphémé ? Brusquement la caresse de velours, dont il sentait la douceur sur sa nuque, était devenue féroce ; des griffes lui arrachaient la chair, son sang coulait une fois encore. Il resta debout pourtant, luttant contre la crise. Il injuriait le péché triomphant, qui ricanait autour de ses tempes, où tous les marteaux du mal recommençaient à battre. Ne connaissait-il pas ses traîtrises ? ne savait-il pas qu’il se fait un jeu souvent d’approcher avec des pattes douces, pour les enfoncer ensuite comme des couteaux jusqu’aux os de ses victimes ? Et sa rage redoublait, à la pensée d’avoir été pris à ce piège, ainsi qu’un enfant. Il serait donc toujours par terre, avec le péché accroupi victorieusement sur sa poitrine ! Maintenant, voilà qu’il niait Dieu. C’était la pente fatale. La fornication tuait la foi. Puis, le dogme croulait. Un doute de la chair, plaidant son ordure, suffisait à balayer tout le ciel. La règle divine irritait, les mystères faisaient sourire ; dans un coin de la religion abattue, on se couchait en discutant son sacrilège, jusqu’à ce qu’on se fût creusé un trou de bête cuvant sa boue. Alors venaient les autres tentations : l’or, la puissance, la vie libre, une nécessité irrésistible de jouir, qui ramenait tout à la grande luxure, vautrée sur un lit de richesse et d’orgueil. Et l’on volait Dieu. On cassait les ostensoirs pour les pendre à l’impureté d’une femme. Eh bien ! il était damné. Rien ne le gênait plus, le péché pouvait parler haut en lui. Cela était bon de ne plus lutter. Les monstres qui avaient rôdé derrière sa nuque se battaient dans ses entrailles, à cette heure. Il gonflait les flancs pour sentir leurs dents davantage. Il s’abandonnait à eux avec une joie affreuse. Une révolte lui faisait montrer les poings à l’église. Non, il ne croyait plus à la divinité de Jésus, il ne croyait plus à la sainte Trinité, il ne croyait qu’à lui, qu’à ses muscles, qu’aux appétits de ses organes. Il voulait vivre. Il avait le besoin d’être un homme. Ah ! courir au grand air, être fort, n’avoir pas de maître jaloux, tuer ses ennemis à coups de pierre, emporter à son cou les filles qui passent ! Il ressusciterait du tombeau où des mains rudes l’avaient couché. Il éveillerait sa virilité, qui ne devait être qu’endormie. Et qu’il expirât de honte, s’il trouvait sa virilité morte ! Et que Dieu fût maudit, s’il l’avait retiré d’entre les créatures, en le touchant de son doigt, afin de le garder pour son service seul !","A great shudder seemed to pass through the church. The terrified priest, now deadly pale again, listened. Who had spoken? Who had blasphemed? Suddenly the velvet caress, the softness of which he felt on his neck, had become fierce; claws tore at his flesh, his blood flowing once again. He remained on his feet, however, fighting the crisis. He cursed triumphant sin, which sneered around his temples, where all the hammers of evil began to beat again. Didn't he know his treacheries? Didn't he know that he often makes a game of approaching with soft paws, then digging them like knives into the bones of his victims? And his rage redoubled at the thought of having been caught in this trap, like a child. So he would still be on the ground, with sin crouching victoriously on his chest! Now, here he was denying God. It was the fatal slope. Fornication killed faith. Then the dogma crumbled. A doubt of the flesh, pleading its filth, was enough to sweep the whole sky. The divine rule irritated, the mysteries made people smile; in a corner of dejected religion, they slept discussing its sacrilege, until they had dug themselves an animal hole sleeping in their mud. Then came the other temptations: gold, power, the free life, an irresistible need to enjoy, which brought everything back to great lust, sprawled on a bed of wealth and pride. And we were robbing God. They broke the monstrances to hang them on the impurity of a woman. Well ! he was damned. Nothing bothered him anymore, sin could speak loudly in him. It was good not to struggle anymore. The monsters that had lurked behind his neck were fighting in his guts at this hour. He puffed out his sides to feel their teeth more. He abandoned himself to them with dreadful joy. A revolt made him show his fists in the church. No, he no longer believed in the divinity of Jesus, he no longer believed in the Holy Trinity, he believed only in himself, only in his muscles, only in the appetites of his organs. He wanted to live. He needed to be a man. Ah! to run in the open air, to be strong, to have no jealous master, to kill his enemies with stones, to carry the girls who pass by around his neck! He would rise from the tomb where rough hands had laid him. He would awaken his manhood, which was only to be asleep. And let him die of shame if he found his virility dead! And cursed be God, if he had taken him from among the creatures, by touching him with his finger, in order to keep him for his own service!","A great shudder seemed to run through the church. The priest, alarmed and once again deathly pale, was listening. Who had been speaking? Who had blasphemed? Suddenly the velvety caress whose softness he had felt on his neck had become ferocious; claws were tearing at his neck, he was bleeding once again. But he remained standing, fighting against this attack. He threw insults at the triumphant sin that sniggered around his temples, on which all the hammers of evil were again starting to beat. Did he not know sin’s trickeries? Didn’t he know that it often plays this game of approaching with gentle paws, only then to dig them in like knives into the bones of its victims? And his rage redoubled at the thought that he had been caught in the trap again, like a child. So he would always be knocked to the ground, with sin squatting victoriously upon his breast! And now indeed he was denying God. That was the fatal downward slope. Fornication killed faith. Then dogma began to crumble. One doubt from the flesh, pleading its filthy cause, was sufficient to sweep away all of Heaven. Divine law became an irritation, the mysteries were risible; in one corner of toppled religion, man lay down and discussed his sacrilege, until he had dug a hole for himself to sleep off his filth. Then came new temptations: gold, power, an unfettered life, an irresistible need for sexual pleasure, which brought everything back to total debauchery, wallowing on a bed of wealth and pride! And God was robbed. The sacred monstrances were broken, and hung on the impurity of a woman. Well! he was damned. Nothing held him back now, sin could speak aloud in him. It was good not to struggle any more. The monsters which had prowled behind his neck, now fought in his entrails. He swelled his loins to feel their teeth more sharply. He abandoned himself to them with a terrible joy. A movement of rebellion made him shake his fists at the church. No, he no longer believed in the divinity of Jesus, he no longer believed in the Holy Trinity, he believed only in himself, in his muscles, in the appetites of his organs. He wanted to live. He felt the need to be a man. Oh! to run in the open air, to be strong, to have no jealous master, to kill his enemies with stones, and throw passing girls over his shoulder and carry them off! He would come back to life from the tomb where cruel hands had buried him. He would awaken his virility, which could only be sleeping. And let him just die of shame if he found his virility dead! And let God be cursed, if he had drawn him away from other creatures by touching him with his finger, just to keep him for his sole service!","A mighty shudder seemed to sweep through the church. The terrified priest turned deadly pale and listened. Who had spoken? Who was it that had blasphemed? Suddenly the velvety caress, whose gentle pressure he had felt upon his shoulder, turned fierce and savage: sharp talons seemed to be rending his flesh, and once more he felt his blood streaming forth. Yet he remained on his feet, struggling against the sudden attack. He cursed and reviled the triumphant sin that sniggered and grinned round his temples, whilst all the hammers of the Evil One battered at them. Why had he not been on his guard against Satan's wiles? Did he not know full well that it was his habit to glide up softly with gentle paws that he might drive them like blades into the very vitals of his victim? His anger increased as he thought how he had been entrapped, like a mere child. Was he destined, then, to be ever hurled to the ground, with sin crouching victoriously on his breast? This time he had actually denied his God. It was all one fatal descent. His transgression had destroyed his faith, and then dogma had tottered. One single doubt of the flesh, pleading abomination, sufficed to sweep heaven away. The divine ordinances irritated one; the divine mysteries made one smile. Then came other temptations and allurements; gold, power, unrestrained liberty, an irresistible longing for enjoyment, culminating in luxuriousness, sprawling on a bed of wealth and pride. And then God was robbed. His vessels were broken to adorn woman's impurity. Ah! well, then, he was damned. Nothing could make any difference to him now. Sin might speak aloud. It was useless to struggle further. The monsters who had hovered about his neck were battening on his vitals now. He yielded to them with hideous satisfaction. He shook his fists at the church. No; he believed no longer in the divinity of Christ; he believed no longer in the Holy Trinity; he believed in naught but himself, and his muscles and the appetites of his body. He wanted to live. He felt the necessity of being a man. Oh! to speed along through the open air, to be lusty and strong, to owe obedience to no jealous master, to fell one's enemies with stones, to carry off the fair maidens that passed upon one's shoulders. He would break out from that living tomb where cruel hands had thrust him. He would awaken his manhood, which had only been slumbering. And might he die of shame if he should find that it were really dead! And might the Divinity be accursed if, by the touch of His finger, He had made him different from the rest of mankind."

"Le prêtre avait eu un tressaillement. Il ne répondit pas, il s’efforça de suivre le jeu, les paupières battantes. La partie continuait avec acharnement. La Teuse regagna son as, puis le reperdit.

He did not answer, he made a great effort to follow the game, with quivering eyelids. The game went on relentlessly. La Teuse won back her ace, then lost it again.

"Là, en effet, dans la fissure même de la pierre, des plantains magnifiques étalaient leurs larges feuilles. Elle avait achevé d’emplir son tablier, lorsqu’elle crut entendre un bruit singulier. Un froissement de branches, un glissement de petits cailloux montaient du gouffre qui longeait un des côtés du cimetière, et au fond duquel coulait le Mascle, un torrent descendu des hauteurs du Paradou. La pente était si rude, si impraticable, que Désirée songea à quelque chien perdu, à quelque chèvre échappée. Elle s’avança vivement. Et, comme elle se penchait elle resta stupéfaite, en apercevant au milieu des ronces une fille qui s’aidait des moindres creux du roc avec une agilité extraordinaire.","There, indeed, in the very fissure of the stone, magnificent plantains spread out their large leaves. She had finished filling her apron when she thought she heard a strange noise. A rustling of branches, a sliding of small pebbles rose from the abyss which skirted one of the sides of the cemetery, and at the bottom of which flowed the Mascle, a torrent descending from the heights of Paradou. The slope was so steep, so impassable, that Desiree thought of some lost dog, some escaped goat. She moved forward quickly. And, as she leaned over, she was stupefied when she saw in the midst of the brambles a girl who was helping herself to the smallest hollows in the rock with extraordinary agility.","There indeed, growing out of cracks in the stone, magnificent plantains were displaying their wide leaves. She had just finished emptying her apron, when she thought she heard a very odd noise. A rustling of branches and a clattering of pebbles seemed to be coming up from the gully that bordered one side of the cemetery, at the bottom of which ran the Mascle, a torrent that flowed down from the heights of the Paradou. The slope was so steep, so unmanageable, that Désirée thought it might be a lost dog or a strayed goat. She rushed forward, and as she leaned over the side, she was astonished to see a girl climbing up through the brambles with amazing agility, making use of the slightest hollows in the rock.","There were, indeed, some magnificent plantains spreading out their broad leaves beside the stone. Desiree had just finished filling her apron with them when she fancied she heard a strange noise behind her. A rustling of branches and a rolling of small pebbles came from the ravine which skirted one side of the graveyard, and at the bottom of which flowed the Mascle, a stream which descended from the high lands of the Paradou. But the ascent here was so rough, so impracticable, that Desiree imagined that the noise could only have been made by some lost dog or straying goat. She stepped quickly to the edge, and, as she looked over, she was amazed to see amidst the brambles a girl who was climbing up the rocks with extraordinary agility."
"— Toutes les bêtes du parc sont avec nous. Ne les sens-tu pas ? Il y a un grand frôlement qui nous suit : ce sont les oiseaux dans les arbres, les insectes dans les herbes, les chevreuils et les cerfs dans les taillis, et jusqu’aux poissons, dont les nageoires battent les eaux muettes… Ne te retourne pas, cela les effrayerait ; mais je suis sûre que nous avons un beau cortège.","— All the animals in the park are with us.

"La Teuse ôta rapidement son tablier, dont elle enveloppa le cou de Mathieu. Ensuite, elle se hâta, elle disparut dans l’église.

Desiree, who had remained kneeling in front of the pig, still patting it on the belly, had raised her head, listening, without ceasing to smile.

She was going to help the cow.","La Teuse quickly took off her apron and used it to cover Matthew’s neck. Then she hurried away and disappeared into the church.

"L’abbé Mouret ne put tenir davantage, dans la chaleur qui montait des portées.

"A l’autre bout du village, le tapage avait grandi dans la maison de Bambousse. On entendait distinctement les culs de verres tapés en mesure sur la table. Le prêtre s’était remis à marcher, sans lever la tête, se dirigeant vers la grande clarté que jetait la fenêtre, pareille à la flambée d’un feu de sarments.

There is not a place in your body that you have not handed over to me, not one of your hairs that I am not mistress of. You have a sign on your left shoulder, I kissed it, it's mine.

"— Ah ! tenez, s’écria la vieille servante, vous êtes trop fier, monsieur ! Ce n’est pas beau non plus, l’orgueil !… À votre place, moi, je ne me raidirais pas comme cela.

It's happening little by little... Instead of you, you're even avoiding saying people's names. You forbid anyone to talk about them, they are as if they were dead.

But you, on the other hand, you even avoid speaking the name of certain people. You forbid any mention of them, it’s as if they were dead.

Well! now I’m going to speak up, and tell you what I know, because I can see all this silence is torturing your heart.’","'Ah! sir,' cried the old servant, 'you are too proud and reserved. It is not a nice thing, that pride of yours.—If I were in your place, I would not harden myself like that. I would talk of what was troubling me, and not try to rend my heart in pieces. You should reconcile yourself to the separation gradually. The worry wears off little by little. But, instead of that, you won't even allow people's names to be uttered. You forbid them to be mentioned. It is as though they were dead. Since you came back, I have not dared to tell you the least bit of news. Well, well, I am going to speak now, and I shall tell you all I know; because I see quite well that it is all this silence that is preying upon your heart.'"
"Le lendemain, vers trois heures, la Teuse et Frère Archangias, qui causaient sur le perron du presbytère, virent le cabriolet du docteur Pascal traverser le village, au grand galop du cheval. De violents coups de fouet sortaient de la capote baissée.","The next day, around three o'clock, La Teuse and Brother Archangias, who were chatting on the steps of the presbytery, saw Doctor Pascal's cabriolet crossing the village at full gallop. Violent lashes issued from the lowered hood.","Next day, just before three o’clock, La Teuse and Brother Archangias were talking on the steps of the presbytery when they saw Dr Pascal’s gig dashing through the village at a gallop.

"Serge avait cessé de la questionner, comprenant qu’elle ne voulait pas répondre. Maintenant, dès qu’elle entrait, il la regardait avec anxiété, craignant qu’elle n’eût plus la force un soir de revenir jusqu’à lui. Où pouvait-elle se lasser ainsi ? Quelle lutte de chaque heure la rendait si désolée et si heureuse ? Un matin, un léger pas qu’il entendit sous ses fenêtres le fit tressaillir. Ce ne pouvait être un chevreuil qui se hasardait de la sorte. Il connaissait trop bien ce pas rythmé dont les herbes n’avaient pas à souffrir. Albine courait sans lui le Paradou. C’était du Paradou qu’elle lui rapportait des découragements, qu’elle lui rapportait des espérances, tout ce combat, toute cette lassitude dont elle se mourait. Et il se doutait bien de ce qu’elle cherchait, seule, au fond des feuillages, sans une parole, avec un entêtement muet de femme qui s’est juré de trouver. Dès lors, il écouta son pas. Il n’osait soulever le rideau, la suivre de loin à travers les branches ; mais il goûtait une singulière émotion, presque douloureuse, à savoir si elle allait à gauche ou à droite, si elle s’enfonçait dans le parterre, et jusqu’où elle poussait ses courses. Au milieu de la vie bruyante du parc, de la voix roulante des arbres, du ruissellement des eaux, de la chanson continue des bêtes, il distinguait le petit bruit de ses bottines, si nettement, qu’il aurait pu dire si elle marchait sur le gravier des rivières, ou sur la terre émiettée de la forêt, ou sur les dalles des roches nues. Même il en arriva à reconnaître, au retour, les joies ou les tristesses d’Albine au choc nerveux de ses talons. Dès qu’elle montait l’escalier, il quittait la fenêtre, il ne lui avouait pas qu’il l’avait ainsi accompagnée partout. Mais elle avait dû deviner sa complicité, car elle lui contait ses recherches, désormais, d’un regard.","Serge had stopped questioning her, understanding that she did not want to answer. Now, as soon as she entered, he looked at her anxiously, fearing that she would no longer have the strength one evening to come back to him. Where could she get bored like this? What hourly struggle made her so sorry and so happy? One morning, a light footstep which he heard under his windows made him start. It couldn't be a roe deer that ventured like that. He knew too well that rhythmic step which the grass did not suffer. Albine ran the Paradou without him. It was from Paradou that she brought her discouragements, that she brought her hopes, all this struggle, all this weariness of which she was dying. And he had a good idea of what she was looking for, alone, in the depths of the foliage, without a word, with the mute stubbornness of a woman who has sworn to find it. From then on, he listened to her step. He dared not raise the curtain, follow her from afar through the branches; but he tasted a singular emotion, almost painful, to know whether she was going to the left or to the right, whether she was sinking into the floor, and how far she was pushing her races. Amid the noisy life of the park, the rolling voice of the trees, the trickling of the waters, the continuous song of the beasts, he could make out the little noise of her boots, so distinctly, that he could have told if she was walking on the gravel of rivers, or on the crumbled earth of the forest, or on the slabs of bare rocks. He even came to recognize, on his return, Albine's joys or sadness by the nervous shock of her heels. As soon as she climbed the stairs, he left the window, he did not admit to her that he had thus accompanied her everywhere. But she must have guessed his complicity, because she told him about her research, now, with a look.","Realizing that she was unwilling to answer, Serge had stopped questioning her. Now, as soon as she came in, he looked at her anxiously, fearing that one evening she wouldn’t even have the strength to come back. Where could she be getting herself so very tired? What continual struggle could be bringing her such despair and such happiness? One morning he was startled by the sound of a light step beneath his windows. It couldn’t be a deer, daring to come so close. He well knew those rhythmic steps that touched the grass so lightly. Albine was roaming the Paradou without him. It was from the Paradou that she brought back her discouragement, that she brought her hopefulness, and all that struggle, all that weariness that was killing her. And he could easily guess what she was looking for on her own, without a word, in the depths of all that foliage, with the dumb obstinacy of a woman who has sworn she will succeed in her search. After that he listened for her footsteps. He didn’t dare lift the curtain to follow her movement through the branches, but he felt a strange, almost painful emotion, knowing from her steps whether she was going to left or right, whether she was plunging into the flower garden, and how far she was going in her search. Even amid the noisy life of the park, the restless voice of the trees, the flowing of the streams, the perpetual noise of all the creatures, he could distinguish the sound of her little boots so clearly that he could tell if she was walking on the gravel by the rivers, the crumbling soil of the forest, or the flat stones of the bare rocks. Eventually he could even tell whether Albine was happy or sad from the sound of her heels as she made her way back. As soon as she started to climb the stair, he left the window, he did not confess he had been following her in this way everywhere she went. But she must have guessed, for thereafter, at a glance, she told him about her searches.","Serge, recognising that she was unwilling to reply, had ceased to question her; and, when she now entered his room, he contented himself with casting an anxious glance at her, fearful lest some evening she should no longer have strength enough to come to him. Where could she thus reduce herself to such exhaustion? What perpetual struggle was it that brought about those alternations of joy and despair? One morning he started at the sound of a light footfall beneath his window. It could not be a roe venturing abroad in that manner. Moreover he could recognise that light footfall. Albine was wandering about the Paradou without him. It was from the Paradou that she returned to him with all those hopes and fears and inward wrestlings, all that lassitude which was killing her. And he could well guess what she was seeking out there, alone in the woody depths, with all the silent obstinacy of a woman who has vowed to effect her purpose. After that he used to listen for her steps. He dared not draw aside the curtain and watch her as she hurried along through the trees; but he experienced strange, almost painful emotion, in listening to ascertain what direction she took, whether she turned to right or to left, whether she went straight on through the flower-beds, and how far her ramble extended. Amidst all the noisy life of the Paradou, amidst the soughing chorus of the trees, the rustling of the streams, and the ceaseless songs of the birds, he could distinguish the gentle pit-pat of her shoes so plainly that he could have told whether she was stepping over the gravel near the rivers, the crumbling mould of the forest, or the bare ledges of the rocks. In time he even learned to tell, from the sound of her nervous footfall, whether she came back hopeful or depressed. As soon as he heard her step on the staircase, he hurried from the window, and he never let her know that he had thus followed her from afar in her wanderings. But she must have guessed it, for with a glance she always afterwards told him where she had been."
"Un instant, il parut surpris. Puis, cessant de sourire, il murmura simplement :","For a moment he looked surprised. Then, ceasing to smile, he simply murmured:","For a moment he seemed surprised. Then, no longer smiling, he simply murmured:","For a moment he seemed surprised. Then, the smile dying from his face, he murmured quietly:"
"— Oh ! vous ! reprit-elle, vous accepteriez que les pies elles-mêmes bâtissent leurs nids dans l’église. Vous ne voyez rien, vous trouvez tout parfait… Votre sœur est joliment heureuse que vous l’ayez prise avec vous, au sortir du séminaire. Pas de père, pas de mère. Je voudrais savoir qui lui permettrait de patauger comme elle le fait, dans une basse-cour ?","- Oh ! you ! she resumed, you would allow the magpies themselves to build their nests in the church. You don't see anything, you find everything perfect... Your sister is delightfully happy that you took her with you when you left the seminary. No father, no mother. I would like to know who would allow her to wade like she does, in a barnyard?","‘Oh! You! You’d even let the magpies build their nests in the church. You just don’t see, you find everything quite perfect... Your sister is really lucky you took charge of her when you came out of the seminary. No mother, no father. I can’t think of anyone else who’d allow her to go squelching around in a farmyard as she does.’","The servant took her stand in the centre of the room. 'I do believe you yourself wouldn't mind a bit if the magpies actually built their nests in the church. You never can see anything, everything seems just what it ought to be to you. Your sister is precious lucky in having had you to take charge of her when you left the seminary. No father, no mother. I should like to know who would let her mess about as she does in a farmyard.'"
"Le prêtre approuva de la tête. La violence de Frère Archangias, la tyrannie bavarde de la Teuse, étaient comme des coups de lanières, dont il goûtait souvent le cinglement sur ses épaules. Il avait une joie pieuse à s’enfoncer dans la bassesse, entre ces mains pleines de grossièretés populacières. La paix du ciel lui semblait au bout de ce mépris du monde, de cet encanaillement de tout son être. C’était une injure qu’il se réjouissait de faire à son corps, un ruisseau dans lequel il se plaisait à traîner sa nature tendre.","The priest nodded. The violence of Brother Archangias, the talkative tyranny of La Teuse, were like blows from the thongs, the lashing of which he often tasted on his shoulders. He had a pious joy in sinking into baseness, between these hands full of popular coarseness. The peace of heaven seemed to him at the end of this contempt for the world, this bewilderment of his whole being. It was an insult he delighted in doing to his body, a stream in which he liked to drag his tender nature.","The priest nodded in assent. The violence of Brother Archangias and the loquacious tyranny of La Teuse were like the lashes of a whip, whose sting he often felt on his shoulders. It was with a pious joy that he sank into these base depths, and these hands full of the grossest vulgarity. The peace of Heaven seemed to him to lie at the bottom of this contempt for the world, and this brutalization of his whole being. It was an insult he enjoyed inflicting on his body, a gutter into which it pleased him to drag his tender nature.","The priest nodded approvingly. Brother Archangias's outrageous violence and La Teuse's loquacious tyranny were like castigation with thongs, which it often rejoiced him to find lashing his shoulders. He took a pious delight in sinking into abasement beneath their coarse speech. He seemed to see the peace of heaven behind contempt of the world and degradation of his whole being. It was delicious to inflict mortification upon his body, to drag his susceptible nature through a gutter."
"Vincent emplit les burettes, des fioles de verre grossier, tandis qu’elle se hâtait de prendre un manuterge[11] propre, dans un tiroir. L’abbé Mouret, tenant le calice de la main gauche par le nœud, les doigts de la main droite posés sur la bourse, salua profondément, sans ôter sa barrette, un Christ de bois noir pendu au-dessus du buffet. L’enfant s’inclina également ; puis, passant le premier, tenant les burettes recouvertes du manuterge, il quitta la sacristie, suivi du prêtre qui marchait les yeux baissés, dans une dévotion profonde.","Vincent filled the burettes, vials of coarse glass, while she hastened to take a clean manuterge[11] from a drawer. Abbé Mouret, holding the chalice in his left hand by the knot, the fingers of his right hand resting on the purse, bowed deeply, without removing his barrette, to a black wooden Christ hanging above the sideboard. The child also bowed; then, passing first, holding the cruets covered with the manuterge, he left the sacristy, followed by the priest who walked with lowered eyes, in deep devotion.","Vincent filled the cruets, phials of crude glass, while she hastened to find a clean manuterge* in one of the drawers. Abbé Mouret, holding the chalice by the knot, in his left hand, with the fingers of his right hand placed upon the burse, bowed deeply without taking off his biretta, to the crucifix of black wood hanging over the dresser. The lad also bowed; then, leading the way and carrying the cruets, covered with the manuterge, he left the sacristy, followed by the priest, who walked with eyes lowered, deep in his devotions.","Thereupon Vincent filled the cruets, phials of coarse glass, while she hastened to take a clean finger-cloth from a drawer. Abbe Mouret, holding the chalice by its stem with his left hand, the fingers of his right resting meanwhile on the burse, then bowed profoundly, but without removing his biretta, to a black wooden crucifix, which hung over the side-board. The lad bowed too, and, bearing the cruets covered with the finger-cloth, led the way out of the sacristy, followed by the priest, who walked on with downcast eyes, absorbed in deep and prayerful meditation."
"Dès le petit jour, il s’agenouilla devant le crucifix. Et la grâce vint, abondante comme une rosée. Il ne fit pas d’effort, il n’eut qu’à plier les genoux, pour la recevoir sur le cœur, pour en être trempé jusqu’aux os, d’une façon délicieusement douce. La veille, il avait agonisé, sans qu’elle descendît. Elle restait longtemps sourde à ses lamentations de damné ; elle le secourait souvent, lorsque, d’un geste d’enfant, il ne savait plus que joindre les mains. Ce fut, ce matin-là, une bénédiction, un repos absolu, une foi entière. Il oublia ses angoisses des jours précédents. Il se donna tout à la joie triomphale de la Croix. Une armure lui montait aux épaules, si impénétrable, que le monde s’émoussait sur elle. Quand il descendit, il marchait dans un air de victoire et de sérénité. La Teuse émerveillée alla chercher Désirée, pour qu’il l’embrassât. Toutes deux tapaient des mains, en criant qu’il n’avait pas eu si bonne mine depuis six mois.","At daybreak, he knelt before the crucifix. And grace came, abundant as dew. He made no effort, he only had to bend his knees, to receive it on his heart, to be soaked in it to the bone, in a deliciously sweet way. The day before, he had been dying, without her coming down. For a long time she remained deaf to his laments of the damned; she often helped him when, with a childlike gesture, he could only join his hands. It was, that morning, a blessing, an absolute rest, an entire faith. He forgot his anxieties of the previous days. He gave himself entirely to the triumphal joy of the Cross. Armor rose to her shoulders, so impenetrable, the world dulled on her. When he descended, he walked in an air of victory and serenity. La Teuse, amazed, went to fetch Désirée to kiss her. Both clapped their hands, shouting that he hadn't looked so good in six months.","As soon as it was light he knelt before the crucifix. And grace fell abundantly upon him like dew. He made no effort, he had only to bend his knees to receive it upon his heart, and feel it soak through his whole body, in the sweetest, most delightful way. The day before, he had agonized without receiving any grace. It would often remain deaf to the entreaties he made as a damned soul; and then sometimes come to his aid when he did nothing more than put his hands together like a child. That morning it was a blessing, absolute trust, an impregnable faith. He forgot his anguish of the days before. He gave himself wholly to the triumphal joy of the Cross. An armour covered him to his shoulders, so impenetrable that the outside world attacked it in vain. When he came down, he walked with an air of victory and serenity. La Teuse, astonished, went to fetch Désirée so he could kiss her. Both clapped their hands, exclaiming that he had not looked so well for six months.","At early dawn that day he knelt before the crucifix, and grace came upon him abundantly as dew. He made no effort, he simply fell upon his knees, to receive it in his heart, to be permeated with it to the marrow of his bones in sweetest and most refreshing fulness. On the previous day he had prayed for grace in agony, and it had not come. At times it long remained deaf to his entreaties, and then, when he simply clasped his hands, in quite childlike fashion, it flowed down to succour him. It came upon him that morning like a benediction, bringing perfect serenity, absolute trusting faith. He forgot his anguish of the previous days, and surrendered himself wholly to the triumphant joy of the Cross. He seemed to be cased in such impenetrable armour that the world's most deadly blows would glide off from it harmlessly. When he came down from his bedroom, he stepped along with an air of serenity and victory. La Teuse was astonished, and went to find Desiree, that he might kiss her; and both of them clapped their hands, and said that they had not seen him looking so well for the last six months."
Mais elle hochait la tête ; elle répondait :,But she nodded; she replied:,"But she shook her head, and replied:","But she shook her head as she answered, 'No, no."
"Il l’écarta du geste, la face calmée, en disant :","He waved her away, his face calmed, saying:","He waved her away, and with a calmer expression, said:","He motioned her away from him with his hands, and his face was calm again as he said:"
"— Qui ça, Dieu ? cria Albine affolée, redevenue la grande fille lâchée en pleine nature. Je ne le connais pas, ton Dieu, je ne veux pas le connaître, s’il te vole à moi, qui ne lui ai jamais rien fait. Mon oncle Jeanbernat a donc raison de dire que ton Dieu est une invention de méchanceté, une manière d’épouvanter les gens et de les faire pleurer… Tu mens, tu ne m’aimes plus, ton Dieu n’existe pas.","""Who, God?"" cried Albine in a panic, once again the big girl let loose in the middle of nowhere. I don't know your God, I don't want to know him, if he steals you from me, who have never done anything to him. My uncle Jeanbernat is therefore right to say that your God is an invention of wickedness, a way of frightening people and making them cry... You are lying, you no longer love me, your God does not exist.","Who’s that?’ cried Albine, returning once more to the great child of nature she had been. ‘I don’t know him, your God, and I don’t want to know him if he’s stealing you away from me, who have never done him any harm. My uncle Jeanbernat is quite right then to say that your God is an invention of wickedness, just a way of frightening people, and making them weep... You’re lying , you don’t love me any more, your God doesn’t exist.’","cried Albine, excitedly, suddenly becoming a child of nature once more. ' God! Who is He? I know nothing of your God! I want to know nothing of Him if He has stolen you away from me, who have never harmed Him. My uncle Jeanbernat was right then when he said that your God was only an invention to frighten people, and make them weep! You are lying; you love me no longer, and that God of yours does not exist.'"

"Il s’était levé, il brandissait terriblement son livre. Le docteur lui saisit les mains, les serra contre les siennes, en le conjurant de se calmer. Pendant longtemps, il parla, disant tout ce qui lui venait aux lèvres ; il s’accusait, il laissait échapper des lambeaux d’aveux, il revenait vaguement à ceux qui avaient tué Albine.","He got up, brandishing his book terribly. The doctor seized his hands, pressed them against his own, imploring him to calm down. For a long time he talked, saying whatever came to his lips; he accused himself, he allowed shreds of confessions to escape, he vaguely returned to those who had killed Albine.","He was standing now, and brandishing his book in a fearsome way. The doctor took hold of his hands, and pressed them into his own, begging him to calm down. He talked for a long time, saying all the things that rose to his lips; he blamed himself, let fall scraps of confession, and referred, in a muddled way, to those who had killed Albine.","He sprang to his feet and waved his book about with a terrible gesture. But the doctor caught hold of his hands and clasped them within his own, beseeching him to be calm. And for a long time he talked to him, saying all that he had upon his mind. He blamed himself, made fragmentary confessions of his fault, and vaguely hinted at those who had killed Albine."
"— Jamais je n’ai osé entrer dans tout ce noir, dit Albine à l’oreille de Serge.","""I never dared go into all this darkness,"" Albine whispered in Serge's ear.","‘I’ve never dared to go into all this darkness,’ Albine whispered to Serge.","'I have never dared to venture into all that darkness,' Albine whispered to Serge."
"— Écoutez, monsieur le curé, reprit-il enfin, je suis trop bas pour vous adresser des observations ; seulement, j’ai presque le double de votre âge, je connais le pays, ce qui m’autorise à vous dire que vous n’arriverez à rien par la douceur… Entendez-vous, le catéchisme suffit. Dieu n’a pas de miséricorde pour les impies. Ils les brûlent. Tenez-vous-en à cela.","“Listen, monsieur le cure,” he went on at last, “I am too humble to address any observations to you; only, I'm almost twice your age, I know the country, which authorizes me to tell you that you won't get anywhere by gentleness... Do you understand, the catechism is enough. God has no mercy for the ungodly. They burn them. Stick with it.","‘Now listen, Monsieur le Curé,’ he began again, ‘I am too lowly to offer you advice, but I am almost twice your age, and I know this part of the world, all of which gives me the right to tell you that you won’t get anywhere with gentleness... Believe me, the catechism is enough. God has no mercy for the wicked. He burns them. Just hold on to that.’","'Listen to me, Monsieur le Cure,' he said at last. ' I am too much beneath you to lecture you; but still, I am almost double your age, I know this part, and therefore I feel justified in telling you that you will gain nothing by gentleness. The catechism, understand, is enough. God has no mercy on the wicked. He burns them. Stick to that.'"
"— Va, nous ne sommes pas au bout ! s’écria Albine. Marchons, marchons toujours.","- Go, we are not at the end! cried Albine. Let's walk, let's keep walking.","‘Come on, we haven’t reached the end!’ cried Albine. ‘Let’s walk on, let’s go on walking.’","'Come along; we have not got to the end yet,' cried Albine. ' Let us push on.'"
"Elles ont beau avoir des plaies, des trous dans le corps à y fourrer le poing, elles n’en avalent pas moins leur soupe. C’est pour cela que je les aime ; leur chair repousse en deux jours, leur corps est toujours chaud comme si elles avaient une provision de soleil sous les plumes… Quand je veux les régaler, je leur coupe de la viande crue. Et les vers donc ! Tu vas voir si elles les aiment.","They may have wounds, holes in their bodies to stick their fists in, but they still swallow their soup. That's why I love them; their flesh regrows in two days, their body is always warm as if they had a supply of sunshine under their feathers… When I want to treat them, I cut them raw meat. And the verses! You will see if they like them.","They may have wounds, holes in their bodies the size of your fist, but they gobble up their food just the same.

When I want to give them a special treat, I cut up some raw meat for them. And as for worms! You shall see how fond they are of worms.’","They may have wounds, big holes in their bodies, and still they'll gobble their victuals.

"Elle l’entraîna de nouveau. Ils firent le tour des autres bassins. Dans le bassin voisin, des amarantes avaient poussé, hérissant des crêtes monstrueuses qu’Albine n’osait toucher, songeant à de gigantesques chenilles saignantes. Des balsamines, jaune paille, fleur de pêcher, gris de lin, blanc lavé de rose, emplissaient une autre vasque, où les ressorts de leurs graines partaient avec de petits bruits secs. Puis, c’était au milieu des débris d’une fontaine une collection d’œillets splendides : des œillets blancs débordaient de l’auge moussue ; des œillets panachés plantaient dans les fentes des pierres le bariolage de leurs ruches de mousseline découpée ; tandis que, au fond de la gueule du lion qui jadis crachait l’eau, un grand œillet rouge fleurissait, en jets si vigoureux que le vieux lion mutilé semblait, à cette heure, cracher des éclaboussures de sang. Et, à côté, la pièce d’eau principale, un ancien lac où des cygnes avaient nagé, était devenue un bois de lilas, à l’ombre duquel des quarantaines, des verveines, des belles-de-jour, protégeaient leur teint délicat, dormant à demi, toutes moites de parfums.","She dragged him away again. They circled the other pools. In the neighboring basin, amaranths had grown, bristling with monstrous crests that Albine dared not touch, thinking of gigantic bleeding caterpillars. Straw-yellow, peach-blossom, flax-grey, white washed with rose balsam filled another basin, where the springs of their seeds sprang out with little dry noises. Then, amidst the debris of a fountain, there was a collection of splendid carnations: white carnations overflowed from the mossy trough; variegated carnations planted in the crevices of the stones the motley of their hives of cut muslin; while deep in the mouth of the once-spitting lion a great red carnation bloomed, in jets so vigorous that the mutilated old lion seemed, at this hour, to spit out splashes of blood. And, next to it, the main body of water, an old lake where swans had swum, had become a wood of lilacs, in the shade of which quarantines, verbenas, morning glory, protected their delicate complexion. , half asleep, all moist with perfumes.","She pulled him on again. They made a tour of the old fountains. In the next one, amaranths had grown, bristling with monstrous crests that Albine did not dare to touch, for they made her think of gigantic, bleeding caterpillars. Balsams, straw-coloured, the colour of peach-blossom, grey like flax, or pink-tinged white, filled up another basin, in which the seed-pods snapped with little cracking noises. Then, in the middle of the ruins of another fountain was a collection of superb carnations; white carnations poured over the edge of the mossy basin; multicoloured carnations planted a gaudy medley of flowers like ruffs of lacy muslin in the cracks of the stone, while deep in the jaw of the lion that once spat out water, a big red carnation was blooming with such vigour that the old, mutilated lion now seemed to be spitting out splashes of blood. And close by, the principal water feature, an old lake on which swans had once swum, had become a thicket of lilac, in whose shade stocks, verbenas, and day lilies protected their delicate complexions, all damp and fragrant, and half asleep. ‘And we haven’t even covered half of the flower garden yet!’","She led him still further on. They went the round of all the other basins. In the next one a number of amaranthuses had sprung up, raising monstrous crests which Albine had always shrunk from touching, such was their resemblance to big bleeding caterpillars. Balsams of all colours, now straw-coloured, now the hue of peach-blossom, now blush-white, now grey like flax, filled another basin where their seed pods split with little snaps. Then in the midst of a ruined fountain, there flourished a colony of splendid carnations. White ones hung over the moss-covered rims, and flaked ones thrust a bright medley of blossom between the chinks of the marble; while from the mouth of the lion, whence formerly the water-jets had spurted, a huge crimson clove now shot out so vigorously that the decrepit beast seemed to be spouting blood. Near by, the principal piece of ornamental water, a lake, on whose surface swans had glided, had now become a thicket of lilacs, beneath whose shade stocks and verbenas and day-lilies screened their delicate tints, and dozed away, all redolent of perfume."
— Eh ! Voriau ! Eh !,- Hey! Voriau! Hey!,"‘Here, Voriau, Here!’",And he clapped his hands and called: 'Hie! Voriau! hie!'
"Elle prit son élan ; mais Serge, grâce à ses longues jambes, la devança, cueillit le coquelicot qu’il agita victorieusement. Alors, elle resta les lèvres pincées, sans rien dire, avec une grosse envie de pleurer. Lui, ne sut que jeter la fleur. Puis, pour faire la paix :","She picked up her momentum; but Serge, thanks to his long legs, got ahead of her, picked the poppy and waved it victoriously. So she remained with pursed lips, saying nothing, with a strong desire to cry. He only knew how to throw the flower. Then, to make peace:","She set off with a bound; but Serge, thanks to his longer legs, overtook her, picked the poppy, and brandished it triumphantly. At this, she remained silent, with puckered lips, on the edge of bursting into tears. The only thing he could think of was to throw the flower away. Then, to make peace, he suggested:","And then she sprang forward; but Serge, thanks to his long legs, outstripped her and plucked the poppy, which he waved about victoriously. She stood there with lips compressed, saying nothing, but feeling a strong inclination to cry. Serge threw down the flower. Nothing else occurred to him. Then, to make his peace with her, he asked: 'Would you like me to carry you as I did the other day?'"
"— Tu te portes bien, toi ? reprit-il enfin d’une voix changée.","""Are you doing well, are you?"" he finally resumed in a changed voice.","‘So you’re well, are you?’ he said at last, in a different tone of voice.","You at all events are quite well,' he resumed, in a different voice."
"La basse-cour, en effet, était balayée, lavée, ratissée. Mais de ces eaux sales remuées, de cette litière retournée à la fourche, s’exhalait une odeur fauve, si pleine de rudesse, que l’abbé Mouret se sentit pris à la gorge. Le fumier s’élevait contre le mur du cimetière en un tas énorme qui fumait.","The barnyard, in fact, was swept, washed, raked. But from these stirred up dirty waters, from this litter turned over at the pitchfork, exhaled a tawny odor, so full of harshness, that the Abbé Mouret felt himself caught in the throat. The manure rose against the cemetery wall in a huge smoking heap.","The yard had indeed been swept, washed, and raked over. But from the dirty water that had been disturbed, and the forked-up stable litter, rose an animal smell so rough and pungent that Abbé Mouret felt it catching in his throat. The dunghill was stacked up against the cemetery wall in a huge smoking heap.","The yard had indeed been swept out, washed, and raked over. But the disturbed water and the forked-up litter exhaled so fetid and powerful an odour that Abbe Mouret half choked. The dung was heaped against the graveyard wall in a huge smoking mound."
"L’enfant ne soufflait mot, cramponné aux broussailles, ses yeux sournoisement fermés.","The child did not breathe a word, clinging to the brushwood, his eyes slyly closed.","The child did not utter a word, trying to cling to the bushes, and keeping his eyes craftily closed.","The lad remained dumb, with his cunning eyes tight shut as he clung to the bushes."
"Le soleil était plus fort. Albine s’était attardée à ses préparatifs. Dans la matinée chaude, ils s’en allèrent côte à côte, presque raisonnables. Ils faisaient jusqu’à des vingtaines de pas, sans se pousser, pour rire. Ils causaient.","The sun was stronger. Albine lingered over her preparations. In the hot morning, they went side by side, almost reasonable. They took up to twenty paces, without pushing each other, for fun. They were talking.","The sun was stronger now. Albine had spent too long over her preparations. In the morning heat they set off, side by side, behaving almost sensibly. They were managing twenty paces or more without pushing each other for fun. They chatted:","The sun was hotter than before, Albine had delayed their departure by her extensive preparations. Thus in the heat of the morning they stepped along side by side, almost quietly. They actually managed to take twenty paces at a time without pushing one another or laughing. They began to talk."
"Puis, elle s’échappa d’un saut, sans même l’attendre, et ils suivirent la première rivière qui leur barra la route. C’était une eau plate, peu profonde, coulant entre deux rives de cresson sauvage. Elle s’en allait ainsi mollement, avec des détours ralentis, si propre, si nette, qu’elle reflétait comme une glace le moindre jonc de ses bords. Albine et Serge durent, pendant longtemps, en descendre le courant, qui marchait moins vite qu’eux, avant de trouver un arbre dont l’ombre se baignât dans ce flot de paresse. Aussi loin que portaient leurs regards, ils voyaient l’eau nue, sur le lit des herbes, étirer ses membres purs, s’endormir en plein soleil du sommeil souple, à demi dénoué, d’une couleuvre bleuâtre. Enfin, ils arrivèrent à un bouquet de trois saules ; deux avaient les pieds dans l’eau, l’autre était planté un peu en arrière ; troncs foudroyés, émiettés par l’âge, que couronnaient des chevelures blondes d’enfant. L’ombre était si claire, qu’elle rayait à peine de légères hachures la rive ensoleillée. Cependant, l’eau si unie en amont et en aval avait là un court frisson, un trouble de sa peau limpide, qui témoignait de sa surprise à sentir ce bout de voile traîner sur elle. Entre les trois saules, un coin de pré descendait par une pente insensible, mettant des coquelicots jusque dans les fentes des vieux troncs crevés. On eût dit une tente de verdure, plantée sur trois piquets, au bord de l’eau, dans le désert roulant des herbes.","Then, she escaped with a jump, without even waiting for her, and they followed the first river that blocked their way. It was flat, shallow water, flowing between two banks of wild watercress. It went away thus softly, with slow detours, so clean, so neat, that it reflected like a mirror the slightest reed of its edges. Albine and Serge had to go down the current for a long time, which was going slower than them, before finding a tree whose shade was bathed in this wave of laziness. As far as their gaze carried, they saw the bare water, on the bed of grass, stretching out its pure limbs, falling asleep in the full sun with the supple, half-released sleep of a bluish snake. At last they came to a clump of three willows; two had their feet in the water, the other was planted a little behind; shattered trunks, crumbled by age, crowned with the fair hair of a child. The shadow was so light that it scarcely streaked the sunlit shore with faint hatchings. However, the water so united upstream and downstream had there a short shiver, a clouding of her limpid skin, which testified to her surprise at feeling this piece of sail dragging on her. Between the three willows, a corner of the meadow descended by an imperceptible slope, putting poppies right into the cracks of the old broken trunks. It looked like a green tent, pitched on three stakes, at the edge of the water, in the rolling desert of grass.","Then she bounded off, without even waiting for him, and they walked alongside the first river that barred their way. The water was calm and shallow, flowing between two banks of wild cress. It moved very gently, slowly meandering along, so clean and so clear that it reflected like a mirror even the smallest reed along the banks. For quite a long time, Albine and Serge had to follow the current, which moved less quickly than they, until they found a tree that cast its shadow into that idle water. As far as their eyes could reach, they saw only the bare stream on its grassy bed, stretching out its pure limbs and sleeping in the full sun with the suppleness of a half-uncoiled, bluish snake. At last they reached a grove of three willows: two had their feet in the water, while the other stood a little further back; their shattered trunks, crumbling with age, were crowned with a mass of blond and youthful hair. Their shadow was so pale that it scarcely striped the sunlit bank with their faint outlines. However, the stream, so tranquil both upstream and down, here gave a little shiver, disturbing its limpid surface, expressing surprise at feeling the end of this veil trailing in its water. Between the three willows, the corner of a field sloped almost imperceptibly down to the water, placing poppies even in the cracks of these old and broken trunks. It was like a tent made of greenery, raised on three poles at the edge of the stream in the rolling desert of grasses.","Then she gave a jump and scampered off without waiting for him, and they both walked along the margin of the first stream which barred their onward course. It was a shallow tranquil brook between banks of wild cress. It flowed on so placidly and gently that its surface reflected like a mirror the smallest reed that grew beside it. Albine and Serge followed this stream, whose onward motion was slower than their own, for a long time before they came across a tree that flung a long shadow upon the idle waters. As far as their eyes could reach they saw the bare brook stretch out and slumber in the sunlight like a blue serpent half uncoiled. At last they reached a clump of three willows. Two had their roots in the stream; the third was set a little backward. Their trunks, rotten and crumbling with age, were crowned with the bright foliage of youth. The shadow they cast was so slight as scarcely to be perceptible upon the sunlit bank. Yet here the water, which, both above and below, was so unruffled, showed a transient quiver, a rippling of its surface, as though it were surprised to find even this light veil cast over it. Between the three willows the meadow-land sloped down to the stream, and some crimson poppies had sprung up in the crevices of the decaying old trunks. The foliage of the willows looked like a tent of greenery fixed upon three stakes by the water's edge, beside a rolling prairie."
"Mais les moineaux n’avaient plus peur. Ils étaient revenus, au beau milieu des coups de clochette, effrontés, voletant sur les bancs. Les tintements répétés les avaient même mis en joie. Ils répondirent par de petits cris, qui coupaient les paroles latines d’un rire perlé de gamins libres. Le soleil leur chauffait les plumes, la pauvreté douce de l’église les enchantait. Ils étaient là chez eux, comme dans une grange, dont on aurait laissé une lucarne ouverte, piaillant, se battant, se disputant les mies rencontrées à terre. Un d’eux alla se poser sur le voile d’or de la Vierge qui souriait ; un autre vint, lestement, reconnaître les jupes de la Teuse, que cette audace mit hors d’elle. À l’autel, le prêtre anéanti, les yeux arrêtés sur la sainte hostie, le pouce et l’index joints, n’entendait point cet envahissement de la nef par la tiède matinée de mai, ce flot montant de soleil, de verdures, d’oiseaux, qui débordait jusqu’au pied du Calvaire où la nature damnée agonisait.","But the sparrows were no longer afraid. They had come back, right in the middle of the ringing of the bell, cheeky, fluttering on the benches. The repeated ringing had even made them happy. They answered with little cries, which cut through the Latin words with the pearly laughter of free children. The sun warmed their feathers, the sweet poverty of the church enchanted them. They were there at home, as in a barn, of which one would have left an open skylight, squealing, fighting, arguing over the crumbs encountered on the ground. One of them went to rest on the golden veil of the smiling Virgin; another came briskly to recognize the skirts of La Teuse, whom this audacity infuriated. At the altar, the devastated priest, eyes fixed on the holy host, thumb and forefinger joined, did not hear this invasion of the nave by the warm May morning, this rising flood of sun, greenery, of birds, which overflowed to the foot of Calvary where the damned nature was dying.","But the sparrows had grown cheeky. They had come back, even during the ringing of the bell, boldly fluttering about the benches. The repeated ringing of the bell had indeed pleasurably excited them. They answered it with little twitters that cut across the Latin words like the rippling laughter of children at play. The sun was warming up their feathers, and they were delighted with the kindly poverty of the church. They felt quite at home, as if in a barn with a window left open, chirping and fluttering, fighting over the crumbs on the ground. One of them went and perched on the gold veil of the smiling Virgin; another flitted over to make an inspection of La Teuse’s skirt, with an audacity that enraged her. At the altar, the priest, lost in his devotions, his eyes fixed upon the sacred Host, with thumbs and forefingers joined together, did not even hear this invasion of the nave by the warm May morning, or the rising flood of sunshine, greenery, and birds, which overflowed even up to the foot of the Calvary, on which nature, damned, lay dying.","But the sparrows were now fearless. They had come back even while the bell was ringing, and, unabashed, were fluttering about the benches. The repeated tinklings even roused them into liveliness, and they answered back with little chirps which crossed amid the Latin words of prayer, like the rippling laughs of free urchins. The sun warmed their plumage, the sweet poverty of the church captivated them. They felt at home there, as in some barn whose shutters had been left open, and screeched, fought, and squabbled over the crumbs they found upon the floor. One flew to perch himself on the smiling Virgin's golden veil; another, whose daring put the old servant in a towering rage, made a hasty reconnaissance of La Teuse's skirts. And at the altar, the priest, with every faculty absorbed, his eyes fixed upon the sacred host, his thumbs and forefingers joined, did not even hear this invasion of the warm May morning, this rising flood of sunlight, greenery and birds, which overflowed even to the foot of the Calvary where doomed nature was wrestling in the death-throes."
"— Non, merci, répondit celui-ci en riant. Il faudra le donner à la sœur de monsieur le curé, qui aime bien les bêtes… Au revoir, Jeanbernat.","""No, thank you,"" he replied, laughing. It will have to be given to the priest's sister, who loves animals… Goodbye, Jeanbernat.","‘No, thank you,’ he replied with a laugh. ‘You should give it to Monsieur le Curé’s sister, who loves animals... Goodbye, Jeanbernat.’","'No, thanks,' he answered, laughing. ' You should give them to the Cure's sister; she is very fond of pets. Good day, Jeanbernat.'"
LIVRE DEUXIÈME,BOOK SECOND,BOOK TWO,BOOK II
"Et l’abbé Mouret s’étant arrêté, il s’approcha, il continua :","And Father Mouret having stopped, he approached, he continued:","And when Abbé Mouret stopped, he approached, and went on:","And as Abbe Mouret stopped, he came up and continued: 'Ah!"
"Le soir, après le dîner, Frère Archangias vint faire sa partie de bataille avec la Teuse. Il avait, ce soir-là, une gaieté énorme. Quand le Frère était gai, il allongeait des coups de poing dans les côtes de la Teuse, qui lui rendait des soufflets, à toute volée. Cela les faisait rire, d’un rire dont les plafonds tremblaient. Puis, il inventait des farces extraordinaires : il cassait avec son nez des assiettes posées à plat, il pariait de fendre à coup de derrière la porte de la salle à manger, il jetait tout le tabac de sa tabatière dans le café de la vieille servante, ou bien apportait une poignée de cailloux qu’il lui glissait dans la gorge, en les enfonçant avec la main, jusqu’à la ceinture. Ces débordements de joie sanguine éclataient pour un rien, au milieu de ses colères accoutumées ; souvent un fait dont personne ne riait lui donnait une véritable attaque de folie bruyante, tapant des pieds, tournant comme une toupie, se tenant le ventre.","In the evening, after dinner, Brother Archangias came to play his part in the battle with La Teuse. That evening he was enormously cheerful. When the Brother was happy, he punched La Teuse in the ribs, and she slapped him at full speed. It made them laugh, a laugh that shook the ceilings. Then he would invent extraordinary pranks: he would smash flat plates with his nose, he would wager on cracking open from behind the dining-room door, he would throw all the tobacco in his snuffbox into the old servant's cafe. , or brought a handful of pebbles which he slipped down his throat, pushing them with his hand, up to his waist. These outbursts of sanguine joy burst out for nothing, in the midst of his accustomed anger; often a fact that no one laughed at gave him a veritable attack of noisy madness, stamping his feet, spinning like a top, clutching his stomach.","In the evening, after dinner, Brother Archangias came to play a game of ‘War’ with La Teuse. He was immensely jolly that evening. When he was jolly, he would punch La Teuse in the ribs, and she would respond by hitting him back as hard as she could. That made them both laugh, a laughter that shook the ceiling. Then he would invent all sorts of extraordinary pranks: he would lay plates flat on the table, and break them with his nose, he would bet he could crack the dining room door with his bottom, or he’d throw all the tobacco in his pouch into the old servant’s coffee, or bring in a handful of little pebbles and drop them down the front of her dress, pushing them in with his hand, right down to her belt. These outbursts of jollity would arise out of nothing in particular, in the midst of his usual, surly bad temper; and quite often, something that made no one else laugh would give him a real fit of noisy, wild laughter, and he would stamp his feet and spin round like a top, holding his belly.","In the evening, after dinner, Brother Archangias came in to have his game of cards with La Teuse. He was in a very merry mood that night; and, when the Brother was merry, it was his habit to prod La Teuse in the sides with his big fists, an attention which she returned by heartily boxing his ears. This skirmishing made them both laugh, with a laughter that shook the very ceiling. The Brother, too, when he was in these gay humours, would devise all kinds of pranks. He would try to smash plates with his nose, and would offer to wager that he could break through the dining-room door in battering-ram fashion. He would also empty the snuff out of his box into the old servant's coffee, or would thrust a handful of pebbles down her neck. The merest trifle would give rise to these noisy outbursts of gaiety in the very midst of his wonted surliness. Some little incident, at which nobody else laughed, often sufficed to throw him into a state of wild hilarity, make him stamp his feet, twirl himself round like a top, and hold in his splitting sides."
"Et, quand elle l’interrogea, il ne voulut pas répondre. Il venait de se rappeler la sensation de la chapelle du séminaire sur ses épaules. C’était là cette robe glacée qui lui faisait un corps de pierre. Alors, il fut repris invinciblement par son passé de prêtre. Les vagues souvenirs qui s’étaient éveillés en lui, le long de la route, des Artaud au Paradou, s’accentuèrent, s’imposèrent avec une souveraine autorité. Pendant qu’Albine continuait à lui parler de la vie heureuse qu’ils mèneraient ensemble, il entendait des coups de clochette sonnant l’élévation, il voyait des ostensoirs traçant des croix de feu au-dessus de grandes foules agenouillées.","And when she questioned him, he would not answer. He had just remembered the feeling of the seminary chapel on his shoulders. It was that icy robe that made her body of stone. Then he was invincibly taken back by his past as a priest. The vague memories which had awakened in him along the way, from Artaud to Paradou, became more accentuated, imposed themselves with sovereign authority. While Albine continued to tell him of the happy life they would lead together, he heard bells ringing the elevation, he saw monstrances tracing crosses of fire above large kneeling crowds.","And when she asked him about it, he refused to answer. He had just recalled the sensation of the seminary chapel falling about his shoulders. That was the icy cloak that had turned his whole body to stone. Then he was irresistibly carried back into his priestly past. The vague memories that had occurred to him along the way from Les Artaud to the Paradou grew stronger, and imposed themselves with sovereign authority. While Albine continued to talk of the happy life they would live together, he was hearing the ringing of the bell for the elevation of the Host, and seeing the censers tracing fiery crosses in the air above the heads of great crowds of people on their knees.","She asked him what he meant, but he would not answer her. He had just remembered the feeling he had long ago experienced in the chapel of the seminary. That was the icy robe enwrapping his shoulders and turning him to stone. And then his life as a priest took complete possession of his thoughts. The vague recollections which had haunted him as he walked from Les Artaud to the Paradou became more and more distinct and assumed complete mastery over him. While Albine talked on of the happy life that they would lead together, he heard the tinkling of the sanctuary bell that signalled the elevation of the Host, and he saw the monstrance trace gleaming crosses over the heads of kneeling multitudes. 'And for your sake,' Albine was saying, 'I will put on my broidered skirts again."
"Elle se tourna vers Albine, en ajoutant :","She turned to Albine, adding:",She turned to Albine to add:,"Then she turned to Albine and added: 'How stupid they all look, don't they?"
"— Oh ! pas loin le premier jour, à deux pas de la porte. Vois-tu, je tomberais… Tiens, j’irai là, sous cet arbre, près de la fenêtre.","- Oh ! not far the first day, two steps from the door. You see, I would fall... Here, I'll go there, under that tree, near the window.","‘Oh! not far. The first day, just a step or so outside the door. You see, I’d fall... Oh, I know, I’ll go over there, under that tree near the window.’","The first day only two steps or so beyond the door. I should surely fall—— See, I'll go over there, under that tree close to the window.'"
"— Non, tais-toi, je ne sais plus, je ne veux plus savoir… Je viens de m’éveiller, et je t’ai trouvée là, pleine de roses. Cela suffit.","- No, shut up, I don't know anymore, I don't want to know anymore... I just woke up, and I found you there, full of roses. It's enough.","‘No, be quiet, I don’t know any more, and I don’t want to know any more... I just woke up and found you there, full of roses. That is enough.’","I don't know; I don't want to know any more. . . . I have only just woke up, and found you there, covered with roses. That is enough.'"
"— Et c’est là qu’elle est morte, répéta Serge, l’esprit frappé. Tu as pris sa chambre, tu te sers de ses meubles, tu couches dans son lit.","""And that's where she died,"" Serge repeated, his mind stricken. You took his room, you use his furniture, you sleep in his bed.","‘And this is where she died,’ Serge repeated, much struck by this. ‘You took her room, you use her furniture, and sleep in her bed.’","'And it was here she died?' repeated Serge, who felt touched with sorrow. ' And you have taken her room; you use her furniture, and you sleep in her bed.'"
"— Aussi, murmura-t-elle, c’est la faute de votre oncle Pascal. Allez, je lui en ai dit assez. Mais ces savants, ça tient à leurs idées. Il y en a qui vous font mourir, pour vous regarder dans le corps après… Moi, ça m’avait mise dans une telle colère, que je n’ai voulu en parler à personne. Oui, monsieur, c’est grâce à moi, si personne n’a su où vous étiez, tant je trouvais ça abominable. Quand l’abbé Guyot, de Saint-Eutrope, qui vous a remplacé pendant votre absence, venait dire la messe ici, le dimanche, je lui racontais des histoires, je lui jurais que vous étiez en Suisse. Je ne sais seulement pas où ça est, la Suisse… Certes, je ne veux point vous faire de la peine, mais c’est sûrement là-bas que vous avez pris votre mal. Vous voilà drôlement guéri. On aurait bien mieux fait de vous laisser avec moi qui ne me serais pas avisée de vous tourner la tête.","""So,"" she murmured, ""it's your uncle Pascal's fault."" Come on, I've told him enough. But these scholars depend on their ideas. There are those who make you die, to look at you in your body afterwards... Me, it made me so angry that I didn't want to talk to anyone about it. Yes, sir, it's thanks to me that no one knew where you were, I thought it so abominable. When Father Guyot, from Saint-Eutrope, who replaced you during your absence, came to say mass here on Sundays, I told him stories, I swore to him that you were in Switzerland. I just don't know where it is, Switzerland... Certainly, I don't want to hurt you, but it's surely there that you took your trouble. You are awfully cured. It would have been much better to leave you with me, who wouldn't have dared turn your head.","‘Anyway,’ she said quietly, ‘it’s all your uncle Pascal’s fault. Heavens, I did tell him. But these scientists have their own ideas. Some of them would have you die, just to be able to examine your body afterwards... But it put me in such a rage that I refused to tell anyone about it. Yes, I thought it so abominable, it’s thanks to me that nobody knew where you were. When Abbé Guyot from Saint-Eutrope, the one who replaced you while you were away, came here on Sundays to say Mass, I told him stories, I swore you were in Switzerland. I don’t even know where Switzerland is... Of course I don’t want to cause you any pain, but it’s certainly in the Paradou that you caught your sickness. A funny sort of cure! It would have been much better to leave you with me, I would never have thought of trying to turn your head.’","'Ah!' she murmured, 'it is all the fault of your uncle Pascal. I told him what it would be. But those clever men cling so obstinately to their own ideas. Some of them would kill you, just for the sake of rummaging in your body afterwards— It made me so angry that I would never speak of it to any one. Yes, Monsieur le Cure, you have me to thank that nobody knew where you were; I was so angry about it. I thought it abominable! When Abbe Guyot, from Saint-Eutrope, who took your place during your absence, came to say mass here on Sundays, I told him all sorts of stories. I said you had gone to Switzerland. I don't even know where Switzerland is.—Well! well! I surely don't want to say anything to pain you, but it was certainly over yonder that you got your trouble. Very finely they've cured you indeed! It would have been very much better if they had left you with me. I shouldn't have thought of trying to turn your head.'"
"Agenouillé devant le grand Christ de carton peint, pleurant des larmes qu’il laissait couler sur ses joues comme autant de joies, le prêtre murmurait :","Kneeling before the large painted cardboard Christ, weeping tears which he let fall down his cheeks like so many joys, the priest murmured:","Kneeling before the big Christ of painted cardboard, weeping tears that he allowed to pour down his cheeks like tears of joy, the priest murmured:","Kneeling before the great Christ and bursting into tears, which he let flow down his cheeks as though they were so many blessings, the priest murmured:"
"— Vous auriez bien pu me parler de ces gens, depuis trois mois, finit par dire le prêtre. J’aurais su au moins chez qui je me présentais.","""You could well have spoken to me about these people three months ago,"" the priest said finally. At least I would have known who I was going to.","‘You could very well have told me about these people during the last three months,’ the priest said at last. ‘I’d then at least have known what sort of people I was visiting.’","'You might have spoken to me of those people these three months past,' said the priest at last. ' I should have known at any rate what sort of people I was going to call upon.'"
"Et ils s’enfoncèrent dans le Paradou. L’automne venait, les arbres étaient soucieux, avec leurs têtes jaunies qui se dépouillaient feuille à feuille. Dans les sentiers, il y avait déjà un lit de verdure morte, trempé d’humidité, où les pas semblaient étouffer des soupirs. Au fond des pelouses, une fumée flottait, noyant de deuil les lointains bleuâtres. Et le jardin entier se taisait, ne soufflant plus que des haleines mélancoliques, qui passaient pareilles à des frissons.","And they sank into the Paradou. Autumn was coming, the trees were troubled, with their yellowed heads stripping leaf by leaf. In the paths there was already a bed of dead greenery, soaked with humidity, where footsteps seemed to stifle sighs. At the bottom of the lawns, smoke floated, drowning the bluish distances in mourning. And the whole garden fell silent, breathing only melancholy breaths, which passed like shivers.","And they plunged into the Paradou. Autumn was coming and the trees looked sad, their yellow heads dropping their leaves one by one. A bed of dead foliage, thoroughly wet, already lay on the paths, on which each footstep sounded like a stifled sigh. At the end of the lawns, a haze hung in the air, casting a cloak of mourning over the faraway blue in the distance. And the whole garden was silent, breathing out only melancholy breaths that went by like shudders.","They plunged into the depths of the Paradou. Autumn was fast approaching, and the trees seemed anxious as they stood there with their yellowing crests from which the leaves were falling one by one. The paths were already littered with dead foliage soaked with moisture, which gave out a sound as of sighing beneath one's tread. And away beyond the lawns misty vapour ascended, throwing a mourning veil over the blue distance. And the whole garden was wrapped in silence, broken only by some sorrowful moans that sounded quiveringly."
"Au mois de mai, l’attente du jeune prêtre était pleine d’un heureux espoir. Il ne s’inquiétait même plus des gronderies de la Teuse. S’il restait si tard à prier dans l’église, c’était avec l’idée folle que la grande Vierge dorée finirait par descendre. Et pourtant, il la redoutait, cette Vierge qui ressemblait à une princesse. Il n’aimait pas toutes les Vierges de la même façon. Celle-là le frappait d’un respect souverain. Elle était la Mère de Dieu ; elle avait l’ampleur féconde, la face auguste, les bras forts de l’Épouse divine portant Jésus. Il se la figurait ainsi au milieu de la cour céleste, laissant traîner parmi les étoiles la queue de son manteau royal, trop haute pour lui, si puissante, qu’il tomberait en poudre, si elle daignait abaisser les yeux sur les siens. Elle était la Vierge de ses jours de défaillance, la Vierge sévère qui lui rendait la paix intérieure par la redoutable vision du paradis.","In the month of May, the expectation of the young priest was full of happy hope. He was no longer even bothered by La Teuse's scolding. If he stayed so late to pray in the church, it was with the mad idea that the great golden Virgin would end up descending. And yet, he dreaded her, this Virgin who looked like a princess. He didn't like all Virgins the same. This struck him with sovereign respect. She was the Mother of God; she had the fruitful fullness, the august face, the strong arms of the divine Spouse carrying Jesus. He imagined her thus in the midst of the celestial court, letting the tail of her royal cloak trail among the stars, too high for him, so powerful that it would crumble into powder, if she deigned to lower her eyes to his. She was the Virgin of her days of failure, the stern Virgin who restored her inner peace through the dreadful vision of paradise.","In the month of May, the young priest’s waiting was filled with a joyous hope. He didn’t even worry any more about La Teuse’s scoldings. If he stayed so late at prayer in the church it was with the mad idea that the tall gilded Virgin would finally step down to him. However, he also feared her, this Virgin who looked so like a princess. He did not love all Virgins in the same way. This one aroused in him a sovereign respect. She was the Mother of God; she had the fullness of fecundity, the august countenance, and the powerful arms of the Divine Spouse carrying Jesus. He imagined her in this way, in the courts of Heaven, letting the train of her royal robe float among the stars, too high for him, so mighty that he would crumble into dust if she deigned to lower her eyes to meet his. She was the Virgin of his days of weakness, the severe Virgin who, with the awesome vision of paradise, restored his inner peace.","During the month of May the young priest's expectation was fraught with joyful hope. To La Teuse's grumblings he no longer paid the slightest attention. If he remained so late praying in the church, it was because he entertained the mad idea that the great golden Virgin would at last come down from her pedestal. And yet he stood in awe of that Virgin, so like a princess in her mien. He did not love all the Virgins alike, and this one inspired him with supreme respect. She was, indeed, the Mother of God, she showed the fertile development of form, the majestic countenance, the strong arms of the Divine Spouse bearing Jesus. He pictured her thus, standing in the midst of the heavenly court, the train of her royal mantle trailing among the stars; so far above him, and of such exceeding might, that he would be shattered into dust should she deign to cast her eyes upon him. She was the Virgin of his days of weakness, the austere Virgin who restored his inward peace by an awesome glimpse of Paradise."
"— Per omnia saecula saeculorum[21], dit-il.","""Per omnia saecula saeculorum,"" he said.","‘Per omnia saecula saeculorum,’* said the priest.","'Per omnia soecula soeculorum,' he said."
"Il y eut un court répit. Au-dehors, les voix s’élevaient, plus furieuses. Maintenant, le prêtre distinguait des voix humaines. C’était le village, les Artaud, cette poignée de bâtards poussés sur le roc, avec l’entêtement des ronces, qui soufflaient à leur tour un vent chargé d’un pullulement d’êtres. Les Artaud forniquaient par terre, plantaient de proche en proche une forêt d’hommes, dont les troncs mangeaient autour d’eux toute la place. Ils montaient jusqu’à l’église, ils en crevaient la porte d’une poussée, ils menaçaient d’obstruer la nef des branches envahissantes de leur race. Derrière eux, dans le fouillis des broussailles, accouraient les bêtes, des bœufs cherchant à enfoncer les murs de leurs cornes, des troupeaux d’ânes, de chèvres, de brebis, battant l’église en ruine, comme des vagues vivantes, des fourmilières de cloportes et de grillons attaquant les fondations, les émiettant de leurs dents de scie. Et il y avait encore, de l’autre côté, la basse-cour de Désirée, dont le fumier exhalait des buées d’asphyxie ; le grand coq Alexandre y sonnait l’assaut de son clairon, les poules descellaient les pierres à coups de bec, les lapins creusaient des terriers jusque sous les autels, afin de les miner et de les abîmer, le cochon, gras à ne pas bouger, grognait, attendait que les ornements sacrés ne fussent plus qu’une poignée de cendre chaude, pour y vautrer son ventre. Une rumeur formidable roula, un second assaut fut donné. Le village, les bêtes, toute cette marée de vie qui débordait, engloutit un instant l’église sous une rage de corps faisant ployer les poutres. Les femelles, dans la mêlée, lâchaient de leurs entrailles un enfantement continu de nouveaux combattants. Cette fois, l’église eut un pan de muraille abattu ; le plafond fléchissait, les boiseries des fenêtres étaient emportées, la fumée du crépuscule, de plus en plus noire, entrait par les brèches bâillant affreusement. Sur la croix, le grand Christ ne tenait plus que par le clou de sa main gauche.","There was a short respite. Outside, the voices rose, more furious. Now the priest could distinguish human voices. It was the village, the Artauds, that handful of bastards pushed on the rock, with the stubbornness of brambles, who in turn blew a wind loaded with a swarm of beings. The Artauds fornicated on the ground, planting step by step a forest of men, whose trunks ate up all the space around them. They went up to the church, they burst the door of it with a push, they threatened to obstruct the nave with the invading branches of their race. Behind them, in the tangle of brushwood, came the beasts, oxen trying to break down the walls with their horns, herds of donkeys, goats, sheep, beating the church in ruins, like living waves, anthills of woodlice and crickets attacking the foundations, crumbling them with their serrated teeth. And there was still, on the other side, Désirée's barnyard, the manure of which gave off vapors of asphyxiation; the great rooster Alexander sounded the assault of his bugle there, the hens unsealed the stones with their beaks, the rabbits dug burrows even under the altars, in order to undermine and damage them, the pig, fat not to move , growled, waited for the sacred ornaments to be no more than a handful of hot ashes, to wallow his belly in. A formidable rumor rolled around, a second assault was given. The village, the animals, all this tide of life which overflowed, engulfed the church for a moment under a rage of bodies making the beams bend. The females, in the fray, released from their entrails a continuous birth of new combatants. This time, the church had a section of wall demolished; the ceiling gave way, the woodwork of the windows was swept away, the smoke of the twilight, growing blacker and blacker, entered through the gaps yawning horribly. On the cross, the great Christ was only holding on by the nail of his left hand.","There was a brief respite. Outside, even more furious voices could be heard. Now the priest could make out human voices. It was the village, the Artauds, that handful of bastards growing out of the rock with the obstinacy of brambles, who were now breathing out a wind that carried with it a huge swarming of beings. The Artauds fornicated on the ground, planting from one relative to another a forest of men, whose trunks consumed all the space around them. They were climbing right up to the church, they broke down the door with one shove, it looked as if they would clog the nave with the invading branches of their race. Behind them, in the tangles of undergrowth, came the animals, bulls trying to break through the walls with their horns, herds of donkeys and goats, and flocks of sheep, beating against the ruined church like living waves, whole colonies of woodlice and crickets attacking the foundations, reducing them to rubble with their saw-like teeth. And on the other side, there was still Désirée’s farmyard, its dungheap giving off clouds of asphyxiating stench; Alexander, the big rooster, sounded the charge with his bugle, the hens loosened the stones with their beaks, the rabbits burrowed away even under the altars to undermine and spoil them; the pig, so fat he could hardly move, grunted, waiting for the sacred ornaments to be no more than a handful of warm ash on which he could warm his belly. A frightening noise arose, a second charge was mounted. The village, the animals, this whole tide of overflowing life for an instant swallowed up the church under a frenzy of bodies that made the rafters give way. In the midst of this turmoil, females dropped from their entrails a constant stream of new fighters. This time, a section of the church wall was knocked down; the ceiling started to give way, the wooden frames of the windows were torn away, and the smoky air of twilight, growing ever darker, came in through the dreadful, yawning gaps. On the cross, the big Christ held on only by the nail on his left hand.","A short respite followed. Outside, the voices sounded more angrily, and the priest could now distinguish human ones amongst them. The Artauds, those bastards who sprang up out of the rocky soil with the persistence of brambles, were now in their turn blowing a blast that reeked of teeming life. They had planted everywhere forests of humanity that swallowed up all around them. They came up to the church, they shattered the door with a push, and threatened to block up the very nave with the invading scions of their race. Behind them came the beasts; the oxen that tried to batter down the walls with their horns, the flocks of asses, goats, and sheep, that dashed against the ruined church like living waves, while swarms of wood-lice and crickets attacked the foundations and reduced them to dust with their sawlike teeth. Yet again, on the other side, there was Desiree's poultry-yard, where the dunghill reeked with suffocating fumes. Here the big cock, Alexander, sounded the assault, and the hens loosened the stones with their beaks, and the rabbits burrowed under the very altars; whilst the pig, too fat to stir, grunted and waited till all the sacred ornaments should be reduced to warm ashes in which he might wallow at his ease. A great roar ascended, and a second assault was delivered. The villagers, the animals, all that overflowing sea of life assailed the church with such impetuosity that the rafters bent and curved. This time a part of the walls tottered and fell down, the ceiling shook, the woodwork of the windows was carried away, and the grey mist of the evening streamed in through the frightful gaping breaches. The great Christ now only clung to His cross by the nail that pierced His left hand."

"L’abbé Mouret s’était lentement redressé. Par un effort suprême, il venait de dompter son angoisse. Pâle encore, il dit d’une voix ferme :","Father Mouret had slowly straightened up. By a supreme effort, he had just overcome his anguish. Still pale, he said in a firm voice:","Abbé Mouret had slowly raised himself up. With a supreme effort, he had overcome his anguish. Still pale, he said in a firm voice:","Abbe Mouret slowly raised his head. By a supreme effort he had overcome his agony, and though his face was still very pale, he exclaimed in a firm voice, 'One should never sin; never! never!'"
"Il se surprit un moment à parler haut. Puisque la brèche était toujours là, il rejoindrait Albine, au coucher du soleil. Il ressentait un léger ennui de cette décision. Mais il ne croyait pouvoir faire autrement. Elle l’attendait, elle était sa femme. Quand il voulait évoquer son visage, il ne le voyait plus que très pâle, très lointain. Puis, il était inquiet sur la façon dont ils vivraient ensemble. Il leur serait difficile de rester dans le pays ; il leur faudrait fuir, sans que personne s’en doutât ; ensuite, une fois cachés quelque part, ils auraient besoin de beaucoup d’argent pour être heureux. À vingt reprises, il tenta d’arrêter un plan d’enlèvement, d’arranger leur existence d’amants heureux. Il ne trouva rien. Maintenant que le désir ne l’affolait plus, le côté pratique de la situation l’épouvantait, le mettait avec ses mains débiles en face d’une besogne compliquée, dont il ne savait pas le premier mot. Où prendraient-ils des chevaux pour se sauver ? S’ils s’en allaient à pied, ne les arrêterait-on pas ainsi que des vagabonds ? D’ailleurs, serait-il capable d’être employé, de découvrir une occupation quelconque qui pût assurer du pain à sa femme ? Jamais on ne lui avait appris ces choses. Il ignorait la vie ; il ne rencontrait, en fouillant dans sa mémoire, que des lambeaux de prière, des détails de cérémonial, des pages de l’Instruction théologique, de Bouvier, apprises autrefois par cœur au séminaire. Même des choses sans importance l’embarrassaient beaucoup. Il se demanda s’il oserait donner le bras à sa femme, dans la rue. Certainement, il ne saurait pas marcher, avec une femme au bras. Il paraîtrait si gauche, que le monde se retournerait. On devinerait un prêtre, on insulterait Albine. Vainement il tâcherait de se laver du sacerdoce, toujours il en emporterait avec lui la pâleur triste, l’odeur d’encens. Et s’il avait des enfants, un jour ? Cette pensée inattendue le fit tressaillir. Il éprouva une répugnance étrange. Il croyait qu’il ne les aimerait pas. Cependant, ils étaient deux, un petit garçon et une petite fille. Lui, les écartait de ses genoux, souffrant de sentir leurs mains se poser sur ses vêtements, ne prenant point à les faire sauter la joie des autres pères. Il ne s’habituait pas à cette chair de sa chair, qui lui semblait toujours suer son impureté d’homme. La petite fille surtout le troublait, avec ses grands yeux, au fond desquels s’allumaient déjà des tendresses de femme. Mais non, il n’aurait point d’enfant, il s’éviterait cette horreur qu’il éprouvait, à l’idée de voir ses membres repousser et revivre éternellement. Alors, l’espoir d’être impuissant lui fut très doux. Sans doute, toute sa virilité s’en était allée pendant sa longue adolescence. Cela le détermina. Dès le soir, il fuirait avec Albine.","For a moment he found himself talking loudly. Since the breach was still there, he would join Albine at sunset. He felt a little annoyed at this decision. But he didn't think he could do otherwise. She was waiting for him, she was his wife. When he wanted to evoke his face, he only saw it very pale, very distant. Then he was worried about how they would live together. It would be difficult for them to stay in the country; they would have to flee, without anyone suspecting it; then, once hidden somewhere, they would need a lot of money to be happy. Twenty times, he tried to stop a kidnapping plan, to arrange their existence as happy lovers. He found nothing. Now that desire no longer maddened him, the practical side of the situation terrified him, confronting him with his feeble hands with a complicated task, of which he did not know the first word. Where would they take horses to save themselves? If they went on foot, would they not be arrested like vagabonds? Besides, would he be capable of being employed, of discovering some occupation whatever which could provide bread for his wife? He had never been taught these things. He was ignorant of life; he found, in searching his memory, nothing but scraps of prayer, details of ceremonial, pages of the Instruction theologique, of Bouvier, learned by heart in the seminary. Even unimportant things embarrassed him a lot. He wondered if he would dare to give his wife his arm in the street. Certainly he couldn't walk with a woman on his arm. He would seem so clumsy, the world would turn upside down. We would guess a priest, we would insult Albine. Vainly he would try to wash away the priesthood, he would always carry with him the sad pallor, the smell of incense. What if he had children one day? This unexpected thought made him start. He felt a strange repugnance. He thought he wouldn't like them. However, there were two of them, a little boy and a little girl. He pushed them away from his knees, suffering from feeling their hands resting on his clothes, not taking the joy of other fathers to blow them. He did not get used to this flesh of his flesh, which always seemed to him to sweat his impurity as a man. The little girl especially disturbed him, with her large eyes, in the depths of which already shone the tenderness of a woman. But no, he would not have children, he would avoid the horror he felt at the idea of seeing his limbs grow back and live again forever. So the hope of being impotent was very sweet to him. No doubt all his manhood had gone during his long adolescence. That determined him. By evening he would flee with Albine.","For a moment he caught himself speaking aloud. Since the breach in the wall was still there, he would go back to Albine at sunset. He felt a slight annoyance at this decision. But he could not see what else he could do. She was waiting for him, she was his wife. When he tried to recall her face, he could see only a very pale and distant image. He was also worried about how they would live together. It would be difficult for them to stay in the region; they would have to go away, without anyone knowing; and even then, once they were hidden away somewhere, they would need a lot of money to live happily. He tried, a score of times, to fix on a plan for getting away, and arranging their existence as happy lovers. He tried in vain. Now he was no longer mad with desire, the practical side of the situation appalled him, bringing him, with his feeble hands, face to face with a complicated task he could not begin to comprehend. Where would they get horses for their escape? If they went off on foot, wouldn’t they be arrested as vagrants? Besides, would he be capable of doing a job, of finding some occupation or other to earn the wherewithal to support his wife? These were things he had never been taught. He knew nothing of life: casting through his memory, all he could find were fragments of prayer, details of ceremonial ritual, and some pages of Bouvier’s Instruction in Theology, which he had learned by heart at the seminary. Even trivial details bothered him a great deal. He wondered whether he would dare to take his wife’s arm out in the street. He would certainly have no idea how to walk with a woman on his arm. He would look so awkward that people would turn and stare. They would guess he was a priest, and then insult Albine. In vain would he try to wash away his priesthood. He would always have its sad pallor, and carry with him the smell of incense. And if some day he had children? That unexpected thought made him shudder. He felt a strange repugnance. He thought that he would not love them. However, there were two of them, a boy and a girl. He pushed them away from his knees, distressed when he felt their hands on his clothes, and not enjoying bouncing them up and down, as other fathers did. He could not get used to this flesh of his flesh, which always seemed to him to exude his own male impurity. The little girl especially troubled him with her big eyes, in which womanly tenderness was already visible. But no, he would not have children, he would avoid the horror he felt at the idea of seeing his own limbs growing again, and living again eternally. Then he found the hope of being impotent very soothing. All his virility had no doubt disappeared during his long adolescence. That decided him. That very evening, he would run away with Albine.","At one moment he caught himself talking aloud and saying that, since the breach in the wall was still open, he would go and join Albine at sunset. This decision brought him a slight feeling of worry, but he did not think that he could do otherwise. She was expecting him to go, and she was his wife. When he tried to picture her face, he could only imagine her as very pale and a long way off. Then he felt a little uneasy as to their future manner of life together. It would be difficult for them to remain in the neighbourhood; they would have to go away somewhere, without any one knowing anything about it. And then, when they had managed to conceal themselves, they would need a deal of money in order to live happily and comfortably. He tried a score of times to hit upon some scheme by which they could get away and live together like happy lovers, but he could devise nothing satisfactory. Now that he was no longer wild with passion, the practical side of the situation alarmed him. He found himself, in all his weakness, face to face with a complicated problem with which he was incompetent to grapple. Where could they get horses for their escape? And if they went away on foot, would they not be stopped and detained as vagabonds? Was he capable of securing any employment by which he could earn bread for his wife? He had never been taught any kind of trade. He was quite ignorant of actual life. He ransacked his memory, and he could remember nothing but strings of prayers, details of ceremonies, and pages of Bouvier's 'Instruction Theologique,' which he had learned by heart at the seminary. He worried too over matters of no real concern. He asked himself whether he would dare to give his arm to his wife in the street. He certainly could not walk with a woman clinging to his arm. He would surely appear so strange and awkward that every one would turn round to stare at him. They would guess that he was a priest and would insult Albine. It would be vain for him to try to obliterate the traces of his priesthood. He would always wear that mournful pallor and carry the odour of incense about with him. And what if he should have children some day? As this thought suddenly occurred to him, he quite started. He felt a strange repugnance at the very idea. He felt sure that he should not care for any children that might be born to him. Suppose there were two of them, a little boy and a little girl. He could never let them get on his knees; it would distress him to feel their hands clutching at his clothes. The thought of the little girl troubled him the most; he could already see womanly tenderness shining in the depths of her big, childish eyes. No! no! he would have no children. Nevertheless he resolved that he would flee with Albine that evening."
Elle reprit :,She resumed:,She went on: ‘What does it mean if you dream that a bird is talking to you?’,"'Yes, indeed, very soundly,' replied Serge."

You have no more need of me.’","'Good-bye, then,' he repeated. ' You are quite well now, and have no further need of me.'"
"Ils y allèrent. Ils descendirent un large escalier dont les urnes renversées flambaient encore des hautes flammes violettes des iris. Le long des marches coulait un ruissellement de giroflées pareil à une nappe d’or liquide. Des chardons, aux deux bords, plantaient des candélabres de bronze vert, grêles, hérissés, recourbés en becs d’oiseaux fantastiques, d’un art étrange, d’une élégance de brûle-parfum chinois. Des sedums, entre les balustres brisés, laissaient pendre des tresses blondes, des chevelures verdâtres de fleuve toutes tachées de moisissures. Puis, au bas, un second parterre s’étendait, coupé de buis puissants comme des chênes, d’anciens buis corrects, autrefois taillés en boules, en pyramides, en tours octogonales, aujourd’hui débraillés magnifiquement, avec de grands haillons de verdure sombre, dont les trous montraient des bouts de ciel bleu.","They went there. They descended a wide staircase whose overturned urns still blazed with the high violet flames of the irises. Along the steps flowed a stream of wallflowers like a sheet of liquid gold. Thistles, on both sides, planted candelabra of green bronze, slender, bristling, curved into the beaks of fantastic birds, of a strange art, with the elegance of a Chinese incense-burner. From the sedums, between the broken balusters, let hang blond braids, greenish hair of the river all stained with mold. Then, at the bottom, a second parterre extended, cut with mighty boxwoods like oaks, old correct boxwoods, formerly cut into balls, pyramids, octagonal towers, now magnificently scruffy, with great rags of greenery. dark, whose holes showed bits of blue sky.","They made their way there. They went down a wide flight of steps, whose toppled urns still blazed with the tall purple flames of irises. Along the steps flowed a stream of wallflowers like a carpet of liquid gold. On each side, thistles held up their spindly candelabra of green bronze, spiky and curved like the beaks of fantastic birds, products of some strange art, and elegant like Chinese incense-burners. Between the broken balustrades sedums let fall their blond tresses, their hair of river-green, stained with patches of mildew. Then at the bottom of the steps stretched yet another formal garden, set with box trees strong as oaks, box trees once carefully arranged and pruned into balls, pyramids, or octagonal towers, but now magnificently dishevelled, with holes in their big, dark, ragged greenery showing bits of blue sky.","They went thither. They tripped down some broad steps, from whose fallen urns still flickered the violet fires of the iris. All down the steps streamed gilliflowers, like liquid gold. The sides were flanked with thistles, that shot up like candelabra, of green bronze, twisted and curved into the semblance of birds' heads, with all the fantastic elegance of Chinese incense-burners. Between the broken balustrades drooped tresses of stonecrop, light greenish locks, spotted as with mouldiness. Then at the foot of the steps another parterre spread out, dotted over with box-trees that were vigorous as oaks; box-trees which had once been carefully pruned and clipped into balls and pyramids and octagonal columns, but which were now revelling in unrestrained freedom of untidiness, breaking out into ragged masses of greenery, through which blue patches of sky were visible."
"Il s’allongea ainsi qu’elle le lui ordonnait. Tous deux se tenaient très raides, se touchant des épaules aux pieds, les mains vides, rejetées en arrière, par-dessus leurs têtes. C’étaient surtout leurs mains qui les embarrassaient. Ils conservaient une gravité convaincue. Ils regardaient en l’air, de leurs yeux grands ouverts, disant qu’ils dormaient et qu’ils étaient bien.","He lay down as she ordered. Both stood very stiff, touching from shoulder to toe, empty hands thrown back over their heads. It was mostly their hands that bothered them. They retained a convinced gravity. They were looking up with their eyes wide open, saying they were asleep and fine.","He stretched out, just as she commanded. They both lay very stiff, touching from shoulders to feet, with their empty hands thrown back above their heads. It was their hands that specially bothered them. They both maintained a settled gravity. They gazed up into the air with their eyes wide open, declaring that they were asleep and very comfortable.","He did as he was ordered. They lay there stiffly staring into the air, and saying that they were asleep, and that it was very nice."
"Mais l’abbé Mouret n’avait pas ouvert la porte, qu’il se levait pour le suivre, jetant violemment ses cartes. Il revint, il dit à la Teuse :","But Abbé Mouret had not opened the door when he rose to follow him, violently throwing down his cards. He came back and said to La Teuse:","But Abbé Mouret had not even opened the door before the Brother rose to follow him, flinging his cards down angrily.

— Tu ne t’assois pas ? dit Albine.,"""Won't you sit down?"" said Albina.",‘Aren’t you going to sit down?’ asked Albine.,'Are you not going to sit down?' said Albine.
— N’importe ! M’aimes-tu ?,- Anything ! Do you love me ?,‘No matter! Do you love me?’,"She kissed his wet eyes, as she answered passionately, 'No matter! Do you love me?'"
"Et il dit encore, apaisé, caressant :","And he says again, soothed, caressing:","And then, comforted, he spoke again in an affectionate tone:","And restfully, pettingly, he said once more: 'How warm your hand is now!"
"Matinée d’enfance, polissonnerie de galopins lâchés dans le Paradou. Albine et Serge passèrent là des heures puériles d’école buissonnière, à courir, à crier, à se taper, sans que leurs chairs innocentes eussent un frisson. Ce n’était encore que la camaraderie de deux garnements, qui songeront peut-être plus tard à se baiser sur les joues, lorsque les arbres n’auront plus de dessert à leur donner. Et quel joyeux coin de nature pour cette première escapade ! Un trou de feuillage, avec des cachettes excellentes. Des sentiers le long desquels il n’était pas possible d’être sérieux, tant les haies laissaient tomber de rires gourmands. Le parc avait, dans cet heureux verger, une gaminerie de buissons s’en allant à la débandade, une fraîcheur d’ombre invitant à la faim, une vieillesse de bons arbres pareils à des grands-pères pleins de gâteries. Même, au fond des retraites vertes de mousse, sous les troncs cassés qui les forçaient à ramper l’un derrière l’autre, dans des corridors de feuilles, si étroits, que Serge s’attelait en riant aux jambes nues d’Albine, ils ne rencontraient point la rêverie dangereuse du silence. Rien de troublant ne leur venait du bois en récréation.","Morning of childhood, naughtiness of urchins let loose in the Paradou. Albine and Serge spent childish hours of skipping school there, running, shouting, beating each other, without their innocent flesh giving a shiver. It was still only the camaraderie of two rascals, who will perhaps think later of kissing each other on the cheeks, when the trees will have no more dessert to give them. And what a happy corner of nature for this first getaway! A hole in the foliage, with excellent hiding places. Paths along which it was impossible to be serious, as the hedges dropped with greedy laughter. The park had, in this happy orchard, a childishness of bushes going to the stampede, a coolness of shade inviting hunger, an old age of good trees like grandfathers full of treats. Even, at the bottom of the retreats green with moss, under the broken trunks which forced them to crawl one behind the other, in corridors of leaves, so narrow that Serge, laughing, clung to Albine's bare legs, they did not encounter the dangerous reverie of silence. Nothing troubling came to them from the woods at recreation.","It was a morning of delightful childhood, with all the mischief of naughty little children let loose in the Paradou. Albine and Serge spent childish hours in that shrubbery school, running, shouting, and scuffling, with never a quiver in their innocent flesh. It was still simply the comradeship of two young rascals who might later thinking of kissing each other on the cheek when the trees had no more dessert to offer. And what a happy place it was for this first escapade! A den of leaves, full of excellent hiding places. Paths on which it was impossible to stay serious, with such gourmet laughter falling from the hedges. In this happy orchard, the park had the mischievous playfulness of bushes doing just as they liked, the cool shade for giving appetite, and the old age of kindly trees, like grandfathers laden with treats. Even in the depths of green and mossy hidey-holes, under broken trunks that forced them to crawl along one after the other, in corridors of leaves so narrow that Serge, laughing, held on to Albine’s bare legs, they did not encounter any perilous reveries of silence. Nothing troubling came to them from this playtime of the woods.","It was a morning of childish play, of wild gambols in the Paradou. Albine and Serge spent hours, scampering up and down, shouting and sporting with each other, their thoughts still all innocence. And in what a delicious spot they found themselves! Depths of greenery, with undiscoverable hiding-places; paths, along whose windings it was never possible to be serious, such greedy laughter fell from the very hedges. In this happy orchard, there was such a playful straggling of bushes, such fresh and appetising shade, such a wealth of old trees laden like kindly grandfathers with sweet dainties. Even in the depths of the recesses green with moss, beneath the broken trunks which compelled them to creep the one behind the other, in the narrow leafy alleys, the young folks never succumbed to the perilous reveries of silence. No trouble touched them in that happy wood."
"Serge se mit à quelques pas d’elle, dans un fauteuil, parlant d’autre chose. Ils étaient très las tous les deux, comme s’ils avaient fait une longue course. Et ils éprouvaient un malaise, à croire que les peintures les regardaient. Les grappes d’Amours roulaient hors des lambris, avec un tapage de chairs amoureuses, une débandade de gamins éhontés leur jetant leurs fleurs, les menaçants de les lier ensemble, à l’aide des faveurs bleues dont ils enchaînaient étroitement deux amants, dans un coin du plafond. Les couples s’animaient, déroulaient l’histoire de cette grande fille nue aimée d’un faune, qu’ils pouvaient reconstruire depuis le guet du faune derrière un buisson de roses, jusqu’à l’abandon de la grande fille au milieu des roses effeuillées. Est-ce qu’ils allaient tous descendre ? N’était-ce pas eux qui soupiraient déjà, et dont l’haleine emplissait la chambre de l’odeur d’une volupté ancienne ?","Serge sat a few steps away from her, in an armchair, talking about something else. They were both very tired, as if they had run a long race. And they felt uneasy, as if the paintings were looking at them. The clusters of Cupids rolled out of the paneling, with a din of amorous flesh, a stampede of shameless boys throwing their flowers at them, threatening to bind them together, with the help of the blue favors with which they tightly chained two lovers, in a corner of the ceiling. The couples came alive, unfolding the story of this tall naked girl loved by a faun, whom they could reconstruct from the lookout of the faun behind a bush of roses, to the abandonment of the tall girl in the middle of the trees. leafless roses. Were they all going down? Was it not they who were already sighing, and whose breath filled the room with the odor of an ancient pleasure?","Serge installed himself in an armchair a few feet away and began to talk about other things. They were both very tired, as if they had walked a very long way. And they were uneasy, feeling the pictures were looking at them. The clusters of cupids seemed to roll out of the panelling with a clamour of amorous bodies, a stampede of shameless little boys throwing their flowers at them, and threatening to tie them together with the blue ribbons they were using to bind two lovers together in one corner of the ceiling. The couples were springing to life, unfolding the story of the naked girl and her faun lover, a story they could reconstruct, from the faun spying on her from behind a rose bush to the girl’s surrender among the rose petals. Were they all going to come down on them? Were they not there already, sighing, and with their breath filling the room with the odour of the lusts of long ago?","Serge sat down in a chair, a little distance away, and began to talk of other matters. But they remained uneasy. They seemed to think that all those painted figures were gazing at them. It was as if the trooping cupids were springing out of the panelling, casting the flowers they held around them, and threatening to bind them together with the blue ribbons which already enchained two lovers in one corner of the ceiling. And the whole story of the nymph and her faun lover, from his first peep at her to his triumph among the flowers, seemed to burst into warm life. Were all those lovers, all those impudent shameless cupids about to step down from their panels and crowd around them? They already seemed to hear their panting sighs, and to feel their breath filling the spacious room with the perfume of voluptuousness."
"Mais Serge était secoué d’un tressaillement. Il se souvenait. Le passé ressuscitait. Au loin, il entendait nettement vivre le village. Ces paysans, ces femmes, ces enfants, c’était le maire Bambousse, revenant de son champ des Olivettes, en chiffrant la prochaine vendange ; c’étaient les Brichet, l’homme traînant les pieds, la femme geignant de misère ; c’était la Rosalie, derrière un mur, se faisant embrasser par le grand Fortuné. Il reconnaissait aussi les deux galopins, dans le cimetière, ce vaurien de Vincent et cette effrontée de Catherine, en train de guetter les grosses sauterelles volantes, au milieu des tombes ; même ils avaient avec eux Voriau, le chien noir, qui les aidait, quêtant parmi les herbes sèches, soufflant à chaque fente des vieilles dalles. Sous les tuiles de l’église, les moineaux se battaient, avant de se coucher ; les plus hardis redescendaient, entraient d’un coup d’aile, par les carreaux cassés, si bien qu’en les suivant des yeux, il se rappelait leur beau tapage, au bas de la chaire, sur la marche de l’estrade, où il y avait toujours du pain pour eux. Et, au seuil du presbytère, la Teuse, en robe de cotonnade bleue, semblait avoir encore grossi ; elle tournait la tête, souriant à Désirée, qui revenait de la basse-cour, avec de grands rires, accompagnée de tout un troupeau. Puis, elles disparurent toutes deux. Alors, Serge, éperdu, tendit les bras.","But Serge was shaken with a start. He remembered. The past resurrected. In the distance, he could clearly hear the village living. These peasants, these women, these children, it was Mayor Bambousse, returning from his field of Olivettes, calculating the next harvest; it was the Brichets, the man dragging his feet, the woman moaning with misery; it was Rosalie, behind a wall, being kissed by the tall Fortuné. He also recognized the two rascals in the cemetery, that scoundrel Vincent and that brazen Catherine, watching for the great flying grasshoppers in the middle of the graves; they even had with them Voriau, the black dog, who helped them, begging among the dry grass, blowing at each crack in the old flagstones. Under the tiles of the church, the sparrows were fighting, before going to bed; the boldest came down again, flew in through the broken panes, so that, following them with his eyes, he remembered their fine uproar, at the bottom of the pulpit, on the step of the platform, where there was always bread for them. And, on the threshold of the presbytery, La Teuse, in a blue cotton dress, seemed to have put on more weight; she turned her head, smiling at Desiree, who was returning from the barnyard, with great laughter, accompanied by a whole herd. Then they both disappeared. Then Serge, bewildered, stretched out his arms.","But Serge was shaken by a great shudder. He was remembering. The past was coming back to life. In the distance he could clearly hear the life of the village. These peasants, these women, these children, were Bambousse the mayor, coming back from the Olivettes, calculating what the next grape harvest would bring; and the Brichets, the man dragging his feet and the woman complaining bitterly of poverty; and Rosalie, getting herself embraced by big Fortuné behind a wall. And he now recognized the two kids in the cemetery, the good-for-nothing Victor and the brazen Catherine, looking for big flying grasshoppers among the tombs; they even had with them the black dog Voriau, who was helping them, hunting through the dry grass and sniffing at every crack in the old stones. Under the red tiles of the church the sparrows were squabbling before settling down for the night; the boldest among them flew back down, winging their way through the broken panes, and as he followed them with his eyes, Serge remembered the delightful clamour they made at the foot of the pulpit, and on the step of the altar platform, where there was always some bread for them. And on the threshold of the presbytery, La Teuse, in the blue cotton dress, seemed to have grown even fatter; she was turning her head, smiling at Désirée, who was returning from the farmyard laughing merrily, and followed by quite a flock. Then they both disappeared from view. At this, Serge, distraught, stretched out his arms.","But Serge was quivering. He had began to recollect. The past was re-awakening. He could distinctly hear the stir of the village life. Those peasants, those women and children, he knew them. There was the mayor, Bambousse, returning from Les Olivettes, calculating how much the approaching vintage would yield him; there were the Brichets, the husband crawling along, and the wife moaning with misery. There was Rosalie flirting with big Fortune behind a wall. He recognised also the pair in the churchyard, that mischievous Vincent and that bold hussy Catherine, who were catching big grasshoppers amongst the tombstones. Yes, and they had Voriau, the black dog, with them, helping them and ferreting about in the dry grass, and sniffing at every crack in the old stones. Under the eaves of the church the sparrows were twittering and bickering before going to roost. The boldest of them flew down and entered the church through the broken windows, and, as Serge followed them with his eyes, he recollected all the noise they had formerly made below the pulpit and on the step by the altar rails, where crumbs were always put for them. And that was La Teuse yonder, on the parsonage doorstep, looking fatter than ever in her blue calico dress. She was turning her head to smile at Desiree, who was coming up from the yard, laughing noisily. Then they both vanished indoors, and Serge, distracted with all these revived memories, stretched out his arms."
"Il se prosternait, il sentait les trois coups de l’Angélus lui passer sur la nuque, lui retentir jusqu’au cœur. La cloche prenait une voix plus haute. Elle revint, implacable, pendant quelques minutes qui lui parurent durer des années. Elle évoquait toute sa vie passée, son enfance pieuse, ses joies du séminaire, ses premières messes, dans la vallée brûlée des Artaud, où il rêvait la solitude des saints. Toujours elle lui avait parlé ainsi. Il retrouvait jusqu’aux moindres inflexions de cette voix de l’église, qui sans cesse s’était élevée à ses oreilles, pareille à une voix de mère grave et douce. Pourquoi ne l’avait-il plus entendue ? Autrefois, elle lui promettait la venue de Marie. Était-ce Marie qui l’avait emmené, au fond des verdures heureuses, où la voix de la cloche n’arrivait pas ? Jamais il n’aurait oublié, si la cloche n’avait cessé de sonner. Et, comme il se courbait davantage, la caresse de sa barbe sur ses mains jointes lui fit peur. Il ne se connaissait pas ce poil long, ce poil soyeux qui lui donnait une beauté de bête. Il tordit sa barbe, il prit ses cheveux à deux mains, cherchant la nudité de la tonsure ; mais ses cheveux avait poussé puissamment, la tonsure était noyée sous un flot viril de grandes boucles rejetées du front jusqu’à la nuque. Toute sa chair, jadis rasée, avait un hérissement fauve.","He prostrated himself, he felt the three blows of the Angelus pass on the nape of his neck, resound to his heart. The bell took on a louder voice. She came back, relentless, for a few minutes that seemed like years. She evoked all his past life, his pious childhood, his joys in the seminary, his first masses, in the scorched valley of Artaud, where he dreamed of the solitude of the saints. She had always spoken to him like this. He recognized even the slightest inflections of that voice of the church, which had ceaselessly risen in his ears, like a mother's grave and gentle voice. Why hadn't he heard her anymore? Formerly, she promised him the coming of Mary. Was it Marie who had taken him, to the depths of happy greenery, where the voice of the bell did not reach? He would never have forgotten if the bell hadn't stopped ringing. And, as he bent further, the caress of his beard on his clasped hands frightened him. He did not know this long hair, this silky hair which gave him the beauty of an animal. He twisted his beard, he took his hair with both hands, seeking the nudity of the tonsure; but her hair had grown powerfully, the tonsure was drowned in a virile flood of great curls thrown back from the forehead to the nape of the neck. All his flesh, formerly shaved, had a tawny bristle.","He prostrated himself, he could feel the three strokes of the Angelus moving across his neck and resonating in his very heart. The voice of the bell became louder. It returned, implacable, for a few minutes which to him felt like years. It called up all his past life, his pious childhood, the joys of the seminary, his first celebrations of Mass in the scorched village of Les Artaud, where he dreamed of the solitude of the saints. It had always spoken to him in this way. He recognized even the slightest inflections of that voice of the church, which had constantly reached his ears like the voice of a grave and gentle mother. Why had he stopped hearing it? Formerly it had promised him the coming of Mary. Was it Mary who had led him away, deep into happy greenery, out of reach of the sound of the bell? He would never have forgotten, if the bell had not stopped ringing. And as he bent lower, he was alarmed by the caress of his beard on his clasped hands. He did not know he had all this hair, this silky hair that gave him an animal beauty. He twisted his beard and took his hair in both hands, seeking the bald patch of the tonsure; but his hair had grown vigorously and the tonsure was drowned in a virile flood of large curls, flowing back from his brow to the nape of his neck. His whole body, previously shaven, had the prickliness of a wild animal.","He bent down towards the ground, and he felt the three peals of the Angelus pass over his neck and echo through his heart. The voice of the bell seemed to grow louder. It was raised again sternly, pitilessly, for a few moments which seemed to him to be years. It summoned up before him all his old life, his pious childhood, his happy days at the seminary, and his first Masses in that burning valley of Les Artaud, where he had dreamt of a solitary, saintly life. He had always heard it speaking to him as it was doing now. He recognised every inflection of that sacred voice, which had so constantly fallen upon his ears, like the grave and gentle voice of a mother. Why had he so long ceased to hear it? In former times it had promised him the coming of Mary. Had Mary come then and taken him and carried him off into those happy green fastnesses, which the sound of the bell could not reach? He would never have lapsed into forgetfulness if the bell had not ceased to ring. And as he bent his head still lower towards the earth, the contact of his beard with his hands made him start. He could not recognise his own self with that long silky beard. He twisted it and fumbled about in his hair seeking for the bare circle of the tonsure, but a heavy growth of curls now covered his whole head from his brow to the nape of his neck."
"Il laissa retomber la barrière de bois qui fermait la haie. La maison reprit sa paix heureuse, au soleil de midi, dans le bourdonnement des grosses mouches qui montaient le long du lierre, jusqu’aux tuiles.","He let fall the wooden barrier that closed the hedge. The house resumed its happy peace, in the midday sun, in the buzzing of the big flies which climbed along the ivy, up to the tiles.","He dropped back the wooden gate that closed off the hedge. The house resumed its air of happy peacefulness in the midday sun, with the buzzing of the big flies climbing up the ivy to the tiles of the roof.","He let the wooden gate which closed the hedge fall to again, and the house assumed once more its aspect of happy peacefulness in the noonday sunlight, amidst the buzzing of the big flies that swarmed all up the ivy even to the roof tiles."
"L’abbé Mouret dépensa là ses économies du séminaire. C’étaient, d’ailleurs, des embellissements dont la naïveté maladroite eût fait sourire. La maçonnerie le rebuta vite. Il se contenta de recrépir le tour de l’église, à hauteur d’homme. La Teuse gâchait le plâtre. Quand elle parla de réparer aussi le presbytère, qu’elle craignait toujours, disait-elle, de voir tomber sur leurs têtes, il lui expliqua qu’il ne saurait pas, qu’il faudrait un ouvrier ; ce qui amena une querelle terrible entre eux. Elle criait qu’il n’était pas raisonnable de faire si belle une église où personne ne couchait, lorsqu’il y avait à côté des chambres dans lesquelles on les trouverait sûrement morts, un de ces matins, écrasés par les plafonds.","Father Mouret spent his seminary savings there. They were, moreover, embellishments whose clumsy simplicity would have made you smile. Masonry soon put him off. He contented himself with replastering around the church, at eye level. La Teuse ruined the plaster. When she spoke of repairing the presbytery as well, which she said she was always afraid of seeing fall on their heads, he explained to her that he would not know, that a workman would be needed; which led to a terrible quarrel between them. She cried out that it was unreasonable to make a church so beautiful where no one slept, when there were rooms nearby in which they would surely be found dead, one of these mornings, crushed by the ceilings.","Abbé Mouret spent all his seminary savings on the work. His embellishments were so clumsy and naive as to raise a smile. The masonry-work soon lost its appeal for him. He contented himself with replastering all round the church to the height of a man’s head. La Teuse mixed the plaster. When she spoke of repairing the presbytery too, which she still feared would fall down on their heads, he explained that he wouldn’t know how to do that, it would need a builder; and this led to a terrible quarrel between the two. She yelled that it wasn’t sensible so to beautify a church in which nobody slept, when right next door there were bedrooms in which they would surely some morning be found dead, crushed beneath the ceiling.","Abbe Mouret spent all his savings on it. Some of his decorations, indeed, were so awkward that they would have excited many people's smiles. The replastering of the stonework soon tired him: so he contented himself with patching up the church walls all round to a height of some six feet from the ground. La Teuse mixed the plaster. When she talked of repairing the parsonage as well, for she was continually fearing that it would topple down on their heads, he told her that he did not think he could manage it, that a regular workman would be necessary; a reply which led to a terrible quarrel between them. La Teuse said it was quite ridiculous to go on ornamenting the church, where nobody slept, while their bedrooms were in such a crazy condition, for she was quite sure they would all be found, one morning, crushed to death by the fallen ceilings."
"— Je ne sais plus. C’était tout petit, et voilà que ça grandit toujours… Emporte-moi, cache-moi.","- I do not know anymore. It was very small, and now it's still growing... Take me away, hide me.","‘I don’t know any more. It was quite small, and now it’s just getting bigger and bigger... Take me away, hide me.’","'I don't know. It was quite little, and now it is ever growing bigger and bigger ——Take me away, hide me.'"

"Le Frère, qui avait mangé, resta là, à califourchon sur une chaise retournée, pendant le dîner du prêtre. Depuis que ce dernier était de retour aux Artaud, il venait ainsi presque tous les soirs s’installer au presbytère. Jamais il ne s’y était imposé plus rudement. Ses gros souliers écrasaient le carreau, sa voix tonnait, ses poings s’abattaient sur les meubles, tandis qu’il racontait les fessées données le matin aux petites filles, ou qu’il résumait sa morale en formules dures comme des coups de bâton. Puis, s’ennuyant, il avait imaginé de jouer aux cartes avec la Teuse. Ils jouaient à la bataille, interminablement, la Teuse n’ayant jamais pu apprendre un autre jeu. L’abbé Mouret, qui souriait aux premières cartes abattues rageusement sur la table, tombait peu à peu dans une rêverie profonde ; et, pendant des heures, il s’oubliait, il s’échappait, sous les coups d’œil défiants de Frère Archangias.","The Brother, who had eaten, remained there, astride an upturned chair, during the priest's dinner. Since the latter had returned to Artaud, he had come almost every evening to settle in the presbytery. Never had he imposed himself more harshly. His heavy shoes crushed the tiled floor, his voice thundered, his fists fell on the furniture, while he related the spankings given to little girls in the morning, or summed up his morality in formulas as harsh as the blows of a stick. Then, being bored, he had imagined playing cards with La Teuse. They played at battle, interminably, La Teuse never having been able to learn another game. and, for hours, he forgot himself, he escaped, under the distrustful glances of Brother Archangias.","The Brother, who had already eaten, stayed on while the priest had dinner, sitting astride a chair he had turned round. Ever since the priest had come back to Les Artaud, he had been installing himself like this in the presbytery almost every evening. Never before had he imposed himself so crudely. His big boots seemed to crush the floor, his voice boomed, and his fists thumped the furniture as he recounted the beatings his stick had administered to the little girls that morning, or outlined his moral code in terms as unrelenting as any stick. Then when he got bored, he suggested playing cards with La Teuse. They played ‘War’* interminably, as La Teuse had never managed to learn any other game. Abbé Mouret would smile as the first few cards were slapped down furiously on the table, but would then slip into a profound reverie; and for hours on end he would forget everything, escaping, even under the watchful eyes of Brother Archangias.","The Brother, who had already had his own meal, seated himself astride a chair, while the priest dined. Since Serge's return to Les Artaud, the Brother had thus spent most of his evenings at the parsonage; but never before had he imposed his presence upon the other in so rough a fashion. He stamped on the tiled floor with his heavy boots, his voice thundered and he smote the furniture, whilst he related how he had whipped some of his pupils that morning, or expounded his moral principles in terms as stern, as uncompromising as bludgeon-blows. Then feeling bored, he suggested that he and La Teuse should have a game at cards. They had endless bouts of 'Beggar-my-neighbour' together, that being the only game which La Teuse had ever been able to learn. Abbe Mouret would smilingly glance at the first few cards flung on the table and would then gradually sink into reverie, remaining for hours forgetful of his self-restraint, oblivious of his surroundings, beneath the suspicious glances of Brother Archangias."
"— Non, ceux-là sont au diable, reprit plus violemment le Frère. J’ai été paysan comme eux. Jusqu’à dix-huit ans, j’ai pioché la terre. Et plus tard, à l’Institution, j’ai balayé, épluché des légumes, fait les plus gros travaux. Ce n’est pas leur rude besogne que je leur reproche. Au contraire, Dieu préfère ceux qui vivent dans la bassesse… Mais les Artaud se conduisent en bêtes, voyez-vous ! Ils sont comme leurs chiens qui n’assistent pas à la messe, qui se moquent des commandements de Dieu et de l’Église. Ils forniqueraient avec leurs pièces de terre, tant ils les aiment !","""No, those are to the devil,"" resumed the Brother more violently. I was a peasant like them. Until I was eighteen, I dug the earth. And later, at the Institution, I swept, peeled vegetables, did the heavy lifting. It is not their hard work that I blame them for. On the contrary, God prefers those who live in lowliness… But the Artauds behave like animals, you see! They are like their dogs who do not attend Mass, who mock the commandments of God and of the Church. They would fornicate with their plots of land, they love them so much!","‘No, these people are the devil’s own,’ the Brother went on, even more vehemently. ‘I was a peasant, just like them. Until I was eighteen, I worked with a spade. And later, at the Institute, I swept, I peeled vegetables, I did all the heavy work. It’s not their hard labour I find fault with. The reverse, God prefers those who live in lowliness... But the Artauds behave like animals! They’re just like their dogs that also don’t go to Mass, and they couldn’t care less about the commandments of God and the Church. They love their plots of earth so much, they would gladly fornicate with them!’","'But these are the devil's own,' broke in the Brother still more violently. ' I've been a peasant, too. Up to eighteen I dug the earth; and later on, when I was at the Training College, I had to sweep, pare vegetables, do all the heavy work. It's not their toilsome labour I find fault with. On the contrary, for God prefers the lowly. But the Artauds live like beasts! They are like their dogs, they never attend mass, and make a mock of the commandments of God and of the Church. They think of nothing but their plots of lands, so sweet they are on them!'"
"— Tu as donc repeint toute la chambre ? s’écria-t-elle, en sautant de la table. On dirait que ce monde-là se réveille.","""So you repainted the whole room?"" she cried, jumping up from the table. Looks like that world is waking up.","‘Have you been repainting the whole room?’ she cried, leaping down from the table. ‘It looks as if all those people are coming back to life.’","'You have got all the room painted again, then?' she cried, as she sprang from the table. ' These people look as though they were all coming to life again.'"
"Elle sauta à terre, tandis que lui, en sueur, s’adossait contre un arbre pour reprendre haleine. Alors, elle le gronda, elle menaça de ne pas le soigner, s’il retombait malade.","She jumped to the ground, while he, sweating, leaned against a tree to catch his breath. So she scolded him, she threatened not to treat him if he fell ill again.","She leaped down, while he, hot and sweating, leaned against a tree to get his breath back. Then she started scolding him, saying she wouldn’t look after him if he fell ill again.","Then she jumped to the ground; while he, hot and perspiring, leaned against a tree to draw breath. Albine thereupon began to scold him, and threatened that she would not nurse him if he made himself ill again."
"Il frottait doucement sa joue, il s’animait, comme ressuscité.","He gently rubbed his cheek, he came to life, as if resuscitated.","He gently rubbed his cheek against it, growing more animated, as if he were coming back to life.","He gently rubbed his cheek against it, with growing animation, as if he were at last coming back to life."
"Le cabriolet était arrivé au bas du tertre, sur lequel l’église était bâtie. Brusquement, le cheval se cabra, s’arrêta ; et la tête du docteur, toute blanche, toute ébouriffée, s’allongea sous la capote.","The cabriolet had arrived at the bottom of the mound, on which the church was built. Suddenly the horse reared up and stopped; and the doctor's head, all white, all disheveled, stretched out under the hood.","The gig had reached the bottom of the slope on which the church was built. Suddenly the horse reared and stopped and the doctor’s head, quite white and dishevelled, stretched out from under the hood.","The gig had just reached the rising ground on which the church was built. Suddenly, the horse reared and stopped, and the doctor's head, with its long white hair all dishevelled appeared from under the hood."
"Le prêtre éprouvait un malaise. Il se sentait sans force pour ramener à Dieu cet étrange vieillard, dont la raison lui parut singulièrement détraquée. Maintenant, il se rappelait certains bavardages de la Teuse sur le Philosophe, nom que les paysans des Artaud donnaient à Jeanbernat. Des bouts d’histoires scandaleuses traînaient vaguement dans sa mémoire. Il se leva, faisant un signe au docteur, voulant quitter cette maison, où il croyait respirer une odeur de damnation. Mais, dans sa crainte sourde, une singulière curiosité l’attardait. Il restait là, allant au bout du petit jardin, fouillant le vestibule du regard, comme pour voir au delà, derrière les murs. Par la porte grande ouverte, il n’apercevait que la cage noire de l’escalier. Et il revenait, cherchant quelque trou, quelque échappée sur cette mer de feuilles, dont il sentait le voisinage, à un large murmure qui semblait battre la maison d’un bruit de vagues.","The priest felt uneasy. He felt himself powerless to bring back to God this strange old man, whose reason seemed to him singularly unhinged. Now he remembered certain gossip from La Teuse about the Philosopher, the name which the peasants of Artaud gave to Jeanbernat. Bits of scandalous stories lingered vaguely in his memory. He got up, making a sign to the doctor, wanting to leave this house, where he thought he breathed in an odor of damnation. But, in his dull fear, a singular curiosity lingered on him. He remained there, going to the end of the little garden, searching the vestibule with his gaze, as if to see beyond, behind the walls. Through the wide open door, he could see only the black stairwell. And he would come back, looking for some hole, some escape on this sea of leaves, whose neighborhood he felt, by a great murmur which seemed to beat the house with the sound of waves.","The priest felt ill at ease. He didn’t feel strong enough to bring back to God this strange old man, whose mind seemed to him to be strangely disordered. Now he began to recall some of La Teuse’s gossipings about the Philosopher, as the peasants of Les Artaud called Jeanbernat. Vague scraps of scandalous stories lurked in his memory. He stood up, with a sign to the doctor that he wanted to leave this house in which he felt he was inhaling the odour of damnation. But despite his confused fearfulness, a strange curiosity held him back. He stayed on, going to the end of the little garden, intently scanning the hallway, as if to see beyond it, behind the walls. Through the wide open door, he could see only the dark of the staircase. And he went back again, looking for some gap, some little glimpse on to that sea of foliage that he knew to be very near from the great murmuring that seemed to beat against the house with a sound like breaking waves.","The priest felt ill at ease. To lead back to God that singular old man, whose reason seemed to him to be strangely disordered, appeared a task beyond his powers. He now remembered certain bits of gossip he had heard from La Teuse about the Philosopher, as the peasants of Les Artaud dubbed Jeanbernat. Scraps of scandalous stories vaguely floated in his memory. He rose, making a sign to the doctor that he wished to leave this house, where he seemed to inhale an odour of damnation. But, in spite of his covert fears, a strange feeling of curiosity made him linger. He simply walked to the end of the garden, throwing a searching glance into the vestibule, as if to see beyond it, behind the walls. All he could perceive, however, through the gaping doorway, was the black staircase. So he came back again, and sought for some hole, some glimpse of that sea of foliage which he knew was near by the mighty murmur that broke upon the house, like the sound of waves."
"— Laissez, dit l’abbé Mouret doucement, je n’y aurais pas touché… Mange, mange tout, ma chérie.","""Leave it,"" said the Abbé Mouret softly, ""I wouldn't have touched it.

"— Moi, je ne m’éveille jamais, dit Albine. J’ai bien dormi, cette nuit. Et toi ?","""I never wake up,"" said Albine. I slept well that night.

"— Non, ce n’est pas défendu, reprit-elle. Cette histoire-là est bonne pour les bêtes. Ceux qui l’ont répandue, autrefois, avaient intérêt à ce qu’on n’allât pas les déranger dans l’endroit le plus délicieux du jardin… Dis-toi que, dès que tu seras assis sur ce tapis d’herbe, tu seras parfaitement heureux. Alors seulement nous connaîtrons tout, nous serons les vrais maîtres… Écoute-moi, viens avec moi.","""No, it's not forbidden,"" she continued. This story is good for animals.

Only then will we know everything, we will be the true masters… Listen to me, come with me.","‘No, it’s not forbidden,’ she went on again. ‘All that is just a pack of nonsense. Those who invented that story long ago were just wanting to stop people disturbing them in the most delightful part of the garden. Just say to yourself that as soon as you’re sitting on that grassy carpet, you’ll be perfectly happy. Then at last we shall know everything, we shall really be the masters... Listen to me, come with me.’","'No, it is not forbidden,' she resumed.

"— De cette façon, continua-t-il en se tapant les mains pour les essuyer, tu ne viendras peut-être plus rôder ici comme un païen… Les morts iront te tirer les pieds, la nuit, si tu marches encore sur eux.","'That way,' he continued, slapping his hands to wipe them, 'perhaps you won't come prowling around here like a heathen anymore… The dead will drag your feet at night if you still step on them.","‘Now,’ he went on, rubbing his hands to get them clean, ‘perhaps you’ll stop prowling around here like a heathen... The dead will come and pull your toes in the night if you go on walking all over them.’","'Now, perhaps,' he continued, clapping his hands to shake off the earth that soiled them, 'you won't come roaming here any more, like a heathen; the dead will pull your feet at night if you go walking over them again.'"
"— Non, merci, j’aime mieux marcher, cela me fera du bien.","— No, thank you, I prefer to walk, it will do me good.","He jumped off, saying, ‘No thanks, I’d rather walk, it will do me good.’","'No, thanks, I prefer to walk: it will do me good.'"
"— Ici, dit-elle en s’asseyant avec lui sous un gigantesque poirier.","""Here,"" she said, sitting with him under a huge pear tree.","‘Right here,’ she said, sitting down with him under an enormous pear tree.","'Here,' she said, as she seated herself beneath a huge pear-tree."
"Les lèvres balbutiantes, l’abbé Mouret regardait la grande Vierge. Il la voyait venir à lui, du fond de sa niche verte, dans une splendeur croissante. Ce n’était plus un clair de lune roulant à la cime des arbres. Elle lui semblait vêtue de soleil, elle s’avançait majestueusement, glorieuse, colossale, si toute-puissante, qu’il était tenté, par moments, de se jeter la face contre terre, pour éviter le flamboiement de cette porte ouverte sur le ciel. Alors, dans cette adoration de tout son être, qui faisait expirer les paroles sur la bouche, il se souvint du dernier mot de Frère Archangias, comme d’un blasphème. Souvent le Frère lui reprochait cette dévotion particulière à la Vierge, qu’il disait être un véritable vol fait à la dévotion de Dieu. Selon lui, cela amollissait les âmes, enjuponnait la religion, créait toute une sensiblerie pieuse indigne des forts. Il gardait rancune à la Vierge d’être femme, d’être belle, d’être mère ; il se tenait en garde contre elle, pris de la crainte sourde de se sentir tenté par sa grâce, de succomber à sa douceur de séductrice. « Elle vous mènera loin ! » avait-il crié un jour au jeune prêtre, voyant en elle un commencement de passion humaine, une pente aux délices des beaux cheveux châtains, des grands yeux clairs, du mystère des robes tombant du col à la pointe des pieds. C’était la révolte d’un saint, qui séparait violemment la Mère du Fils, en demandant comme celui-ci : « Femme, qu’y a-t-il de commun entre vous et moi ? » Mais l’abbé Mouret résistait, se prosternait, tâchait d’oublier les rudesses du Frère. Il n’avait plus que ce ravissement dans la pureté immaculée de Marie, qui le sortit de la bassesse où il cherchait à s’anéantir. Lorsque, seul en face de la grande Vierge dorée, il s’hallucinait jusqu’à la voir se pencher pour lui donner ses bandeaux à baiser, il redevenait très jeune, très bon, très fort, très juste, tout envahi d’une vie de tendresse.","With stammering lips, the Abbé Mouret gazed at the great Virgin. He saw her coming to him, from the depths of her green niche, in increasing splendour. It was no longer moonlight rolling over the treetops. She seemed to him clothed in the sun, she advanced majestically, glorious, colossal, so all-powerful that he was tempted at times to throw himself face down to avoid the blaze of this door open to the sky. . Then, in this adoration of his whole being, which made the words expire on the mouth, he remembered the last word of Brother Archangias, as a blasphemy. Often the Brother reproached him for this particular devotion to the Virgin, which he said was a real theft made from the devotion of God. According to him, this softened souls, skirted religion, created a whole pious sentimentality unworthy of the strong. He harbored a grudge against the Virgin for being a woman, for being beautiful, for being a mother; he stood on his guard against her, seized with a dull fear of feeling tempted by her grace, of succumbing to her seductive gentleness. ""It will take you far!"" he had cried to the young priest one day, seeing in her the beginnings of human passion, a slope to the delights of the beautiful chestnut hair, the large clear eyes, the mystery of the dresses falling from the collar to the tip of the toes. It was the revolt of a saint, who violently separated the Mother from the Son, asking like this one: “Woman, what do you and me have in common? But Father Mouret resisted, prostrated himself, tried to forget the harshness of the Brother. He had nothing left but this rapture in the immaculate purity of Mary, which lifted him from the baseness in which he sought to annihilate himself. When, alone in front of the great golden Virgin, he was so hallucinated that he saw her lean over to give him her blindfolds to kiss, he became very young again, very good, very strong, very just, all invaded by a life of tenderness.","Abbé Mouret gazed at the Virgin, with his lips moving in prayer. He saw her coming towards him in ever increasing splendour from the depths of her green niche. It was no longer moonlight flowing over the tops of the trees. She now seemed dressed in sunlight; she advanced majestically, glorious and colossal, so all-powerful that he was briefly tempted to throw himself face down on the ground, to avoid the blaze of this door opening on to Heaven. His whole being was rapt in adoration, the words died on his lips, and he then recalled Brother Archangias’s final remark, which seemed a kind of blasphemy. The Brother often reproached him for this special devotion to the Virgin, which he saw as a real theft from the devotion due to God. According to him, it weakened the soul, put religion in petticoats, and created a sentimental type of piety, unworthy of the strong. He resented the Virgin for being a woman, for being beautiful, and for being a mother; he was always on his guard against her, he had a gnawing fear of finding himself tempted by her grace, and succumbing to her seductive charms. ‘She will lead you astray,’ he had one day cried to the young priest; he saw in her the seeds of human passion, a slide towards the delights of beautiful brown hair, large limpid eyes, and mysterious gowns that hung from the neck to the tip of the toes. His was the revolt of a saint, fiercely separating the Mother from the Son, and asking, as the latter had done: ‘Woman, what have I to do with thee?’ * But Abbé Mouret persisted, prostrating himself, and trying to forget the Brother’s harsh words. He had nothing else save his ravished delight in the immaculate purity of Mary, to raise him out of the depths of self-humiliating baseness in which he was trying to drown himself. When alone, in front of the great, gilded Virgin, he hallucinated to the extent of seeing her lean towards him to give him the braids of her hair to kiss, and he once more felt very young, very good, very strong, very just, and brimming with a life made of love.","With quivering lips Abbe Mouret now gazed at the tall Virgin. He could see her coming towards him from the depths of her green bower in ever-increasing splendour. No longer did a flood of moonlight seem to float across the tree-tops. She seemed to him clothed with the sun; she advanced majestically, glorious, colossal, and so all-powerful that he was tempted at times to cast himself face downwards to shun the flaming splendour of that gate opening into heaven. Then, amidst the adoration of his whole being, which stayed his words upon his lips, he remembered Brother Archangias's final rebuke, as he might have remembered words of blasphemy. The Brother often reproved him for his devotion to the Virgin, which he declared was veritable robbery of devotion due to God. In the Brother's opinion it enervated the soul, put religion into petticoats, created and fostered a state of sentimentalism quite unworthy of the strong. He bore the Virgin a grudge for her womanhood, her beauty, her maternity; he was ever on his guard against her, possessed by a covert fear of feeling tempted by her gracious mien, of succumbing to her seductive sweetness. ' She will lead you far!' he had cried one day to the young priest, for in her he saw the commencement of human passion. From contemplating her one might glide to delight in lovely chestnut hair, in large bright eyes, and the mystery of garments falling from neck to toes. His was the blunt rebellion of a saint who roughly parted the Mother from the Son, asking as He did: 'Woman, what have we in common, thou and I?' But Abbe Mouret thrust away such thoughts, prostrated himself, endeavoured to forget the Brother's harsh attacks. His rapture in the immaculate purity of Mary alone raised him from the depths of lowliness in which he sought to bury himself. Whenever, alone before the tall golden Virgin, he so deceived himself as to imagine that he could see her bending down for him to kiss her braided locks, he once more became very young, very good, very strong, very just, full of tenderness."
"Il disait ces choses, courbé à terre, adorant la femme. Albine, orgueilleuse, se laissait adorer. Elle tendait les doigts, les seins, les lèvres, aux baisers dévots de Serge. Elle se sentait reine, à le regarder si fort et si humble devant elle. Elle l’avait vaincu, elle le tenait à sa merci, elle pouvait d’un seul mot disposer de lui. Et ce qui la rendait toute-puissante, c’était qu’elle entendait autour d’eux le jardin se réjouir de son triomphe, l’aider d’une clameur lentement grossie.","He said these things, bowed to the ground, adoring the woman. Albine, proud, allowed herself to be adored. She stretched out her fingers, her breasts, her lips, to Serge's devout kisses. She felt like a queen, looking at him so strong and so humble in front of her. She had vanquished him, she held him at her mercy, she could dispose of him with a single word. And what made her all-powerful was that she heard the garden around them rejoicing in her triumph, helping her with a slowly growing clamor.","He spoke these words, bending to the ground, worshipping the woman. Albine, full of pride, allowed herself to be worshipped. She held out her hands, her breasts, her lips to Serge’s devout kisses. She felt she was indeed a queen, when she saw Serge so strong and so humble before her. She had conquered him, she had him at her mercy, she could dispose of him with but a word. And what made her omnipotent was that all around them, she could hear the garden rejoicing at her triumph, and helping her with an ever louder clamour.","He said this, bowed to the ground, adoring Woman. And Albine, full of pride, allowed herself to be adored. She yielded her hands, her cheeks, her lips, to Serge's rapturous kisses. She felt herself indeed a queen as she saw him, who was so strong, bending so humbly before her. She had conquered him, and held him there at her mercy. With a single word she could dispose of him. And that which helped her to recognise her omnipotence was that she heard the whole garden rejoicing at her triumph, with gradually swelling paeans of approval."
"— Tu es beau, tu es beau ! répétait Albine, lentement accroupie devant lui, levant des regards caressants. Mais pourquoi me boudes-tu, maintenant ? Pourquoi ne me dis-tu rien ?","- You are beautiful, you are beautiful! repeated Albine, crouching slowly in front of him, raising caressing eyes. But why are you sulking now? Why don't you tell me anything?","‘You are handsome, you are handsome!’ Albine slowly repeated, crouching before him, and looking up with loving eyes. ‘But why are you sulking with me now? Why aren’t you speaking to me?’","'Oh! how handsome, how handsome you are!' lingeringly repeated Albine, crouching at his feet and gazing up at him with loving eyes. ' But why are you sulking with me? Why don't you speak to me?'"
"— La vie, c’était le Paradou. Comme il nous paraissait grand ! Jamais nous ne savions en trouver le bout. Les feuillages y roulaient jusqu’à l’horizon, librement, avec un bruit de vagues. Et que de bleu sur nos têtes ! Nous pouvions grandir, nous envoler, courir comme les nuages, sans rencontrer plus d’obstacles qu’eux. L’air était à nous.","“Life was Paradou. How big it seemed to us! We never knew how to find the end of it. The leaves rolled down to the horizon, freely, with the sound of waves. And what blue on our heads! We could grow, fly, run like the clouds, without encountering more obstacles than them. The air was ours.","‘Life was the Paradou. How big it seemed to us! We never were able to find the end of it. All that greenery seemed to roll away to the horizon with no bounds, with a sound like the sea. And so much blue above our heads! We could grow, fly, and run like the clouds, without meeting any more obstacle than they do. The very air was ours.’","She mused for another moment and then continued: 'Life 'twas the Paradou. How vast it used to seem to us! Never were we able to find the end of it. The sea of foliage rolled freely with rustling waves as far as the eye could reach. And all that glorious blue overhead! we were free to grow, and soar, and roam, like the clouds without meeting more obstacles than they. The very air was ours!'"

"Elle s’arrêta, elle montra d’un geste les murs écrasés de l’église.","She stopped, she gestured to the crushed walls of the church.","She paused, and gestured at the crumbling walls of the church.",She stopped and pointed to the low walls of the church.
"Fortuné et Rosalie baissaient le menton, un peu émus, bien qu’ils se fussent poussés du coude en s’agenouillant, pour se faire rire. Cependant, Vincent était allé chercher le bassin et l’aspersoir. Fortuné mit l’anneau dans le bassin, une grosse bague d’argent tout unie. Quand le prêtre l’eut béni en l’aspergeant en forme de croix, il le rendit à Fortuné qui le passa à l’annulaire de Rosalie, dont la main restait verdie de taches d’herbe que le savon n’avait pu enlever.","Fortuné and Rosalie lowered their chins, a little moved, although they had nudged each other on their knees, to make each other laugh. However, Vincent had gone to get the basin and the sprinkler. Fortuné put the ring in the basin, a big plain silver ring. When the priest had blessed it by sprinkling it in the shape of a cross, he gave it back to Fortuné, who passed it to Rosalie's ring finger, whose hand remained green with grass stains that the soap had not been able to remove.","Fortuné and Rosalie had bent their heads, rather moved in fact, although they had nudged each other for a laugh as they knelt down. Meanwhile Vincent had gone to fetch the holy water stoup and the sprinkler. Fortuné placed the ring, a big solid silver ring, in the stoup. When the priest had blessed it, sprinkling it with the sign of the cross, he slipped it on to Rosalie’s ring finger, on her hand still green from the grass stains that soap had not managed to remove.","Fortune and Rosalie bent their heads, affected by some slight emotion, although they had nudged each other with their elbows when they knelt down, by way of making one another laugh. But Vincent went to get the basin and the sprinkler. Fortune placed the ring in the basin, a thick ring of solid silver. When the priest had blessed it, sprinkling it crosswise, he returned it to Fortune, who slipped it upon Rosalie's finger. Her hand was still discoloured with grass-stains, which soap had not been able to remove."
"— Il n’y a rien, rien, rien… Quand on soufflera sur le soleil, ça sera fini.","— There is nothing, nothing, nothing… When we blow on the sun, it will be over.","‘There is nothing, nothing, nothing... When the sun gets blown out, that will be the end.’","He had risen, slowly waving his hand towards the surrounding horizon, to the earth and to the sky, and repeating solemnly: 'There's nothing, nothing, nothing. When the sun is snuffed out, all will be at an end.'"
"Mais, sans qu’on vît personne, sans qu’on aperçût autre chose, en l’air, que les bouleaux balancés de plus en plus furieusement, on entendit une voix claire, coupée de rires, qui criait :","But, without anyone seeing anyone, without seeing anything else in the air, except the birches swinging more and more furiously, we heard a clear voice, broken by laughter, crying:","But, although no person appeared, and nothing could be seen in the air save the birch trees, swaying ever more violently, a clear, laughing voice rang out, shouting:","But, although nobody could be seen, though nothing was visible in the air above save the birches rocking more and more violently, they heard a clear, laughing voice call out: 'Good-bye, doctor!"
"— Eh ! le petit est là, dit la Rousse.","- Hey! the little one is there, said La Rousse.","‘Ah! that’s where the little one is,’ said La Rousse.","'Ah! so the youngster is there,' said La Rousse."
"Et elle le mena sous l’arbre géant, à la place même où elle s’était livrée, et où il l’avait possédée. C’était la même ombre de félicité, le même tronc qui respirait ainsi qu’une poitrine, les mêmes branches qui s’étendaient au loin, pareilles à des membres protecteurs. L’arbre restait bon, robuste, puissant, fécond. Comme au jour de leurs noces, une langueur d’alcôve, une lueur de nuit d’été mourant sur l’épaule nue d’une amoureuse, un balbutiement d’amour à peine distinct, tombant brusquement à un grand spasme muet, traînaient dans la clairière, baignée d’une limpidité verdâtre. Et, au loin, le Paradou, malgré le premier frisson de l’automne, retrouvait, lui aussi, ses chuchotements ardents. Il redevenait complice. Du parterre, du verger, des prairies, de la forêt, des grandes roches, du vaste ciel, arrivait de nouveau un rire de volupté, un vent qui semait sur son passage une poussière de fécondation. Jamais le jardin, aux plus tièdes soirées de printemps, n’avait des tendresses si profondes qu’aux derniers beaux jours, lorsque les plantes s’endormaient en se disant adieu. L’odeur des germes mûrs charriait une ivresse de désir, à travers les feuilles plus rares.","And she led him under the giant tree, to the very place where she had delivered herself, and where he had possessed her. It was the same shadow of bliss, the same trunk that breathed like a chest, the same branches that stretched far away like protective limbs. The tree remained good, robust, powerful, fruitful. As on their wedding day, an alcove languor, a glimmer of summer night dying on the bare shoulder of a lover, a barely distinct stammering of love, suddenly falling in a great silent spasm, lingered in the clearing, bathed in a greenish limpidity. And, in the distance, the Paradou, despite the first shiver of autumn, also found its ardent whispers. He became an accomplice again. From the flower bed, from the orchard, from the meadows, from the forest, from the great rocks, from the vast sky, again came a laugh of pleasure, a wind which sowed a dust of fertilization in its path. Never did the garden, on the warmest spring evenings, have such deep tenderness as on the last fine days, when the plants fell asleep bidding each other farewell. The smell of ripe sprouts carried an intoxication of desire through the rarer leaves.","And she led him to the giant tree, to the place where she had given herself to him, and he had possessed her. It was the same happy shade, the same trunk that breathed like a human breast, the same branches that spread out wide, like protecting arms. The tree was still good, robust, powerful, and fertile. As on the day of their nuptials, a boudoir-like languor, the gleam of a summer night fading away on the bare shoulder of a woman in love, and indistinct mumblings of love, falling suddenly into a great, silent, spasm, still lingered in the glade, bathed in a soft green light. And, in the distance, the Paradou, in spite of the first chills of autumn, found once more its ardent whisperings. It became once more complicit. From the flower garden, the orchard, the grasslands, the forest, the big rocks, and from the vastness of the sky, came once again the sound of voluptuous laughter, and a wind that seemed to sow in its path a dust of fertility. Never, even on the warmest spring evenings, did the garden have such profound tenderness as on these last beautiful days when the plants were going to sleep and saying farewell. Through the now less dense foliage, the scent of ripe seeds was bearing the intoxication of desire.","She led him away to that giant tree, to the very spot where their love had reigned supreme. There was the same bliss-inspiring shade, there was the same trunk as of yore, the same branches spreading far around, like sheltering and protecting arms. The tree still towered aloft, kindly, robust, powerful, and fertile. As on the day of their nuptials, languorous warmth, the glimmer of a summer's night fading on the bare shoulder of some fair girl, a sob of love dying away into passionate silence, lingered about the clearing as it lay there bathed in dim green light. And, in the distance, the Paradou, in spite of the first chills of autumn, sighed once more with passion, again becoming love's accomplice. From the parterre, from the orchard, from the meadow-lands, from the forest, from the great rocks, from the spreading heavens, came back a ripple of voluptuous joy. Never had the garden, even on the warmest evenings of spring-time, shown such deep tenderness as now, on this fair autumn evening, when the plants and trees seemed to be bidding one another goodnight ere they sank to sleep. And the scent of ripened germs wafted the intoxication of desire athwart the scanty leaves."

"Le prêtre ayant fini, elle se hâta de changer la nappe, en ayant bien soin de ne pas effacer les filets. Puis, elle disposa symétriquement la croix, les chandeliers et les vases. L’abbé Mouret était allé s’adosser à côté de Frère Archangias, contre la barrière de bois qui séparait le chœur de la nef. Ils n’échangèrent pas une parole. Ils regardaient la croix d’argent qui, dans l’ombre croissante, gardait des gouttes de lumière, sur les pieds, le long du flanc gauche et à la tempe droite du crucifié. Quand la Teuse eut fini, elle s’avança triomphante :","The priest having finished, she hastened to change the tablecloth, taking great care not to erase the threads. Then she symmetrically arranged the cross, the candlesticks and the vases. Father Mouret had gone to lean his back next to Brother Archangias, against the wooden barrier which separated the choir from the nave. They did not exchange a word. They looked at the silver cross which, in the increasing shadow, kept drops of light, on the feet, along the left side and at the right temple of the crucified. When La Teuse had finished, she advanced triumphantly:","Now the priest had finished, she hurriedly changed the altar cloth, taking care not to smudge the edging lines. Then she laid out symmetrically the cross, the candlesticks, and the vases. Abbé Mouret had gone to lean back against the wooden screen that separated the choir from the nave, alongside Brother Archangias. They did not exchange a word. They were looking at the silver cross which, in the gathering gloom, still had little spots of light on the feet, down the left side of the body, and on the right-hand side of the brow of the crucified Lord. When La Teuse had finished, she came towards them triumphantly.","When the priest had finished, she hastened to change the altar-cloth, taking the greatest care not to smudge the beading. Then she arranged the cross, the candlesticks, and the vases symmetrically. Abbe Mouret had gone to lean against the wooden screen which separated the choir from the nave, by the side of Brother Archangias. Not a word passed between them. Their eyes were fixed upon the silver crucifix, which, in the increasing gloom, still cast some glimmer of light on the feet and the left side and the right temple of the big Christ. When La Teuse had finished, she came down towards them, triumphantly."
"Après l’offertoire, un murmure courut parmi les paysannes. Vincent, qui avait levé curieusement la tête, faillit envoyer toute la braise de son encensoir sur la chasuble du prêtre. Et comme celui-ci le regardait sévèrement, il voulut s’excuser, il murmura :","After the offertory, a murmur ran through the peasant women. Vincent, who had raised his head curiously, almost sent all the embers from his censer on the priest's chasuble. And as the latter looked at him severely, he wanted to excuse himself, he murmured:","After the Offertory, a whisper ran through the women. Vincent, who had looked up in curiosity, almost tipped the burning incense over the priest’s cassock, and as the latter looked at him sternly, he murmured, to excuse himself:","After the offertory, however, a buzzing murmur sped through the peasant women. Vincent inquisitively turned his head, and in doing so, almost let the charcoal in his censer fall upon the priest's chasuble. And, wishing to excuse himself, as he saw the Abbe looking at him with an expression of reproof, he murmured: 'It is your reverence's uncle, who has just come in.'"
"Jusqu’au soir, ils coururent les prairies. Ils allaient devant eux, pour voir. Ils visitaient leur jardin. Albine marchait en avant, avec le flair d’un jeune chien, ne disant rien, toujours en quête de la clairière heureuse, bien qu’il n’y eût pas là les grands arbres qu’elle rêvait. Serge avait toutes sortes de galanteries maladroites ; il se précipitait si rudement pour écarter les hautes herbes, qu’il manquait la faire tomber ; il la soulevait à bras-le-corps, d’une étreinte qui la meurtrissait, lorsqu’il voulait l’aider à sauter les ruisseaux. Leur grande joie fut de rencontrer les trois autres rivières. La première coulait sur un lit de cailloux, entre deux files continues de saules, si bien qu’ils durent se laisser glisser à tâtons au beau milieu des branches, avec le risque de tomber dans quelque gros trou d’eau ; mais Serge, roulé le premier, ayant de l’eau jusqu’aux genoux seulement, reçut Albine dans ses bras, la porta à la rive opposée pour qu’elle ne se mouillât point. L’autre rivière était toute noire d’ombre, sous une allée de hauts feuillages, où elle passait languissante, avec le froissement léger, les cassures blanches d’une jupe de satin, traînée par quelque dame rêveuse, au fond d’un bois ; nappe profonde, glacée, inquiétante, qu’ils eurent la chance de pouvoir traverser à l’aide d’un tronc abattu d’un bord à l’autre, s’en allant à califourchon, s’amusant à troubler du pied le miroir d’acier bruni, puis se hâtant, effrayés des yeux étranges que les moindres gouttes qui jaillissaient ouvraient dans le sommeil du courant. Et ce fut surtout la dernière rivière qui les retint.","Until evening they roamed the meadows. They went in front of them, to see. They were visiting their garden. Albine walked ahead, with the scent of a young dog, saying nothing, always looking for the happy clearing, although there were not the tall trees she dreamed of. Serge had all sorts of clumsy gallantries; he rushed so roughly to push aside the tall grass that he nearly knocked it down; he lifted her up round the body, with an embrace that bruised her, when he wanted to help her jump the streams. Their great joy was to meet the other three rivers. The first flowed over a bed of pebbles, between two continuous rows of willows, so much so that they had to feel their way through the branches, with the risk of falling into some big hole of water; but Serge, rolled over first, having water only up to his knees, received Albine in his arms, carried her to the opposite bank so that she would not get wet. The other river was quite black with shadow, under an avenue of tall foliage, through which it passed languidly, with the light rustling, the white creases of a satin skirt, dragged by some dreamy lady, at the bottom of a wood. ; deep, icy, disturbing sheet, which they were lucky enough to be able to cross with the help of a fallen log from one side to the other, going astride, amusing themselves by disturbing the mirror with their feet of burnished steel, then hastening, frightened by the strange eyes that the smallest drops that gushed opened in the slumber of the current. And it was especially the last river that held them back.","They ran about in the grasslands until the evening. They kept going on just to have a look round. They were inspecting their garden. Albine led the way, with the inquisitive nose of a young dog, saying nothing, but still searching for that blissful glade, although there was no sign of those tall trees of which she dreamed. Serge was full of all sorts of gallantry; he threw himself so energetically into pushing away the tall grasses that he almost knocked her over, and when he tried to help her over the streams, he lifted her bodily with a quite bruising grip. It was a great joy to them to discover three more rivers. The first flowed over a bed of pebbles between two continuous lines of willow, so they had to slide their way along through the branches, at the risk of falling into some deep hole in the water; but Serge, who was the first to slip, with water only up to his knees, took Albine in his arms, and carried her to the opposite bank to save her from a wetting. The other river was very dark, shaded by a line of tall, leafy trees, through which it moved languidly, with the slight rustling and the white creases of a satin skirt trailing behind some lady dreaming in the woodland; it was a deep, ice-cold, alarming expanse that they were luckily able to cross on a tree that had fallen across the stream, straddling the trunk and playfully disturbing that mirror of burnished steel with their feet, but then hurrying on, frightened by the strange eyes that even the tiniest drops of water seemed to open in the sleeping stream. It was the last river that especially held their attention.","They scoured the meadow-lands until evening began to fall. They went on and on, inspecting their garden. Albine walked in front, sniffing like a young dog, and saying nothing, but she was ever in search of the happy glade, although where they found themselves there were none of the big trees of which her thoughts were full. Serge meanwhile indulged in all kinds of clumsy gallantry. He rushed forward so hastily to thrust the tall herbage aside, that he nearly tripped her up; and he almost tore her arm from her body as he tried to assist her over the brooks. Their joy was great when they came to the three other streams. The first flowed over a bed of pebbles, between two rows of willows, so closely planted that they had to grope between the branches with the risk of falling into some deep part of the water. It only rose to Serge's knees, however, and having caught Albine in his arms he carried her to the opposite bank, to save her from a wetting. The next stream flowed black with shade beneath a lofty canopy of foliage, passing languidly onward with the gentle rustling and rippling of the satin train of some lady, dreamily sauntering through the woodland depths. It was a deep, cold, and rather dangerous-looking stream, but a fallen tree that stretched from bank to bank served them as a bridge. They crossed over, bestriding the tree with dangling feet, at first amusing themselves by stirring the water which looked like a mirror of burnished steel, but then suddenly hastening, frightened by the strange eyes which opened in the depths of the sleepy current at the slightest splash. But it was the last stream which delayed them the most."
"— Je m’en doutais, mâcha-t-il entre ses dents. On avait dû le cacher là.","""I thought so,"" he chewed between his teeth. We had to hide it there.","‘Just as I thought,’ he muttered between his teeth. ‘This is where he was bound to be hidden.’","'I suspected it,' he mumbled between his teeth. ' It was virtually certain that they had hidden him here.'"
"— Va-t’en ! répétait Albine qui le suivait, le chassant devant elle, haussant la voix.","- Go away ! repeated Albine, following him, chasing him in front of her, raising her voice.","‘Go away!’ Albine repeated, raising her voice and following him, driving him before her.","'Away with you! Go!' repeated Albine, in louder tones, as she followed and drove him before her."
"— Voyons, mon petit ami, que faisais-tu là ? On ne doit pas jouer dans les cimetières.","- Come on, my friend, what were you doing there? We must not play in cemeteries.","‘Well now, my young friend, what were you doing here? Cemeteries are not meant for playing in.’","'Come, my young friend, what were you doing there?' he asked. ' You must not go playing in graveyards.'"
"— Entendez-vous, rien, il n’y a rien… Tout ça, c’est de la farce.","- Do you hear, nothing, there is nothing ... All that is farce.","‘Understand me, there is nothing, nothing... all that stuff is just a big joke.’","Once more he waved his hand to the horizon and added: 'You hear, nothing; there's nothing. It's all foolery.'"
"Après avoir ramené son bonnet d’une légère tape, essoufflée, la Teuse revint donner un coup de balai devant l’autel. La poussière s’obstinait là, chaque jour, entre les planches mal jointes de l’estrade. Le balai fouillait les coins avec un grondement irrité. Elle enleva ensuite le tapis de la table, et se fâcha en constatant que la grande nappe supérieure, déjà reprisée en vingt endroits, avait un nouveau trou d’usure au beau milieu ; on apercevait la seconde nappe, pliée en deux, si émincée, si claire elle-même, qu’elle laissait voir la pierre consacrée, encadrée dans l’autel de bois peint. Elle épousseta ces linges roussis par l’usage, promena vigoureusement le plumeau le long du gradin, contre lequel elle releva les cartons liturgiques. Puis, montant sur une chaise, elle débarrassa la croix et deux des chandeliers de leurs housses de cotonnade jaune. Le cuivre était piqué de taches ternes.","After bringing her bonnet back with a light tap, out of breath, La Teuse came back to sweep the broom in front of the altar. The dust clung there every day between the badly joined planks of the platform. The broom searched the corners with an irritated growl. She then removed the carpet from the table, and became angry when she noticed that the large top tablecloth, already darned in twenty places, had a new worn hole in the middle; you could see the second tablecloth, folded in two, so thin, so clear itself, that it allowed the consecrated stone to be seen, framed in the altar of painted wood. She dusted off these linens scorched by use, vigorously ran the feather duster along the step, against which she lifted the liturgical boxes. Then, climbing onto a chair, she removed the cross and two of the candlesticks from their yellow cotton covers. The copper was pitted with dull spots.","After setting her bonnet to rights with a little tap, La Teuse, now breathless, went back to sweeping in front of the altar. There was always dust there, every day, settling between the ill-fitting planks of the altar dais. The broom delved into the crevices with a growl of irritation. She then lifted the covering of the altar table and saw with annoyance that the large upper cloth, already darned twenty times or more, now had another hole worn through, right in the middle, so you could see the cloth underneath, folded in two; and that was so thin and transparent you could see through it to the consecrated stone embedded in the altar of painted wood. She dusted the cloths, yellow with use, and flicked her feather duster vigorously along the shelf before replacing the liturgy cards. Then, standing on a chair, she took the yellow cotton dust-covers off the cross and the two candlesticks. The brass was dotted with dull stains.","Having set her cap straight with a little pat, she came back breathless to give a hasty sweep before the altar. Every day the dust persistently settled between the disjoined boards of the platform. Her broom rummaged among the corners with an angry rumble. Then she lifted the altar cover and was sorely vexed to find that the large upper cloth, already darned in a score of places, was again worn through in the very middle, so as to show the under cloth, which in its turn was so worn and so transparent that one could see the consecrated stone, embedded in the painted wood of the altar. La Teuse dusted the linen, yellow from long usage, and plied her feather-brush along the shelf against which she set the liturgical altar-cards. Then, climbing upon a chair, she removed the yellow cotton covers from the crucifix and two of the candlesticks. The brass of the latter was tarnished."
"— Bonjour, frère, dit-elle. Tu veux donc me faire mourir de faim, aujourd’hui ?","""Hello, brother,"" she said. So you want to starve me to death today?","‘Good morning, brother,’ she said. ‘Are you intending to make me die of hunger today?’","'Good morning, brother,' she said. ' Do you want to make me die of hunger this morning?'"
"Jusqu’au soir, Albine et Serge demeurèrent avec les lis. Ils y étaient bien ; ils achevaient d’y naître. Serge y perdait la dernière fièvre de ses mains. Albine y devenait toute blanche, d’un blanc de lait qu’aucune rougeur ne teintait de rose. Ils ne virent plus qu’ils avaient les bras nus, le cou nu, les épaules nues. Leurs chevelures ne les troublèrent plus, comme des nudités déployées. L’un contre l’autre, ils riaient, d’un rire clair, trouvant de la fraîcheur à se serrer. Leurs yeux gardaient un calme limpide d’eau de source, sans que rien d’impur montât de leur chair pour en ternir le cristal. Leurs joues étaient des fruits veloutés, à peine mûrs, auxquels ils ne songeaient point à mordre. Quand ils quittèrent les lis, ils n’avaient pas dix ans ; il leur semblait qu’ils venaient de se rencontrer, seuls au fond du grand jardin, pour y vivre dans une amitié et dans un jeu éternels. Et, comme ils traversaient de nouveau le parterre, rentrant au crépuscule, les fleurs parurent se faire discrètes, heureuses de les voir si jeunes, ne voulant pas débaucher ces enfants. Les bois de pivoines, les corbeilles d’œillets, les tapis de myosotis, les tentures de clématites, n’agrandissaient plus devant eux une alcôve d’amour, noyés à cette heure de l’air du soir, endormis dans une enfance aussi pure que la leur. Les pensées les regardaient en camarades, de leurs petits visages candides. Les résédas, alanguis, frôlés par la jupe blanche d’Albine, semblaient pris de compassion, évitant de hâter leur fièvre d’un souffle.","Until evening Albine and Serge remained with the lilies. They were fine there; they finished being born there. Serge lost the last fever of his hands there. Albine became quite white there, a milky whiteness which no redness tinged with rose. They no longer saw that they had bare arms, bare necks, bare shoulders. Their hair no longer troubled them, like unfurled nakedness. Against each other, they laughed, a clear laugh, finding coolness in squeezing together. Their eyes kept a clear calm of spring water, without anything impure rising from their flesh to tarnish the crystal. Their cheeks were velvety fruits, barely ripe, which they did not dream of biting. When they left the lilies, they were not ten years old; it seemed to them that they had just met, alone at the bottom of the large garden, to live there in an eternal friendship and play. And, as they crossed the floor again, returning at dusk, the flowers seemed to be discreet, happy to see them so young, not wanting to poach these children. The woods of peonies, the baskets of carnations, the carpets of forget-me-nots, the hangings of clematis, no longer enlarged before them an alcove of love, drowned at this hour in the evening air, asleep in such a pure childhood than theirs. Thoughts watched them as comrades, with their candid little faces. The mignonettes, languid, brushed by Albine's white skirt, seemed taken with compassion, avoiding hastening their fever with a breath.","Albine and Serge stayed with the lilies until evening. They were happy there; they were completing the process of being born. There, Serge lost the last vestiges of fever from his hands. Albine became pure white, a milky white, not tinged with the pink of any blush. They no longer noticed that they had bare arms, bare necks, bare shoulders. Their hair no longer disturbed them as if it were a display of nakedness. Huddled close together, they laughed with innocent laughter, and their embrace seemed cool and refreshing. Their eyes retained the limpid calm of spring water, with nothing impure rising from their flesh to mar its crystal purity. Their cheeks were like scarcely ripe, velvety fruit, which they did not dream of biting into. When they left the lilies, they were less than ten years old; it seemed to them they had just met, alone in the depths of this large garden, to live and play there forever, in eternal friendship. And as they crossed the flower garden once more, returning home in the twilight, the flowers seemed more subdued, pleased to see them so young, and not wanting to corrupt these children. The groves of peonies, clusters of carnations, carpets of forget-me-nots, and hanging curtains of clematis no longer spread before them an alcove of love, but immersed now in the evening air, slept in a childhood as innocent as theirs. The pansies, with their honest little faces, gave them friendly looks. The languid mignonettes, when Albine’s white skirt brushed against them, seemed full of compassion, avoiding any breath that might hasten their fever.","Albine and Serge lingered amongst the lilies till evening. They felt so happy there, and seemed to break out into a new life. Serge felt the last trace of fever leave his hands, while Albine grew quite white, with a milky whiteness untinted by any rosy hue. They were unconscious that their arms and necks and shoulders were bare, and their straying unconfined hair in nowise troubled them. They laughed merrily one at the other, with frank open laughter. The expression of their eyes retained the limpid calmness of clear spring water. When they quitted the lilies, their feelings were but those of children ten years old; it seemed to them that they had just met each other in that garden so that they might be friends for ever and amuse themselves with perpetual play. And as they returned through the parterre, the very flowers bore themselves discreetly, as though they were glad to see their childishness, and would do nothing that might corrupt them. The forests of peonies, the masses of carnations, the carpets of forget-me-nots, the curtains of clematis now steeped in the atmosphere of evening, slumbering in childlike purity akin to their own, no longer spread suggestions of voluptuousness around them. The pansies looked up at them with their little candid faces, like playfellows; and the languid mignonette, as Albine's white skirt brushed by it, seemed full of compassion, and held its breath lest it should fan their love prematurely into life."
"Il fit quelques pas, il cria :","He took a few steps, he shouted:","He took a few steps, and shouted:","Then he took a few steps, and cried out: 'I see you."
"— Non, dit-elle.","'No,' she said.","‘No,’ she said.","'No,' she answered, waving her hands afar."
"— Souffert ? oui, oui ; mais il y a longtemps… J’ai mal dormi, j’ai eu des rêves épouvantables. Si je pouvais, je te raconterais tout cela.","- Suffered? yes yes ; but a long time ago...

"Le mystère d’amour, l’immolation de la sainte victime se préparait. Le servant prit le Missel, qu’il porta à gauche, du côté de l’Évangile, en ayant soin de ne point toucher les feuillets du livre. Chaque fois qu’il passait devant le tabernacle, il faisait de biais une génuflexion qui lui déjetait la taille. Puis, revenu à droite, il se tint debout, les bras croisés, pendant la lecture de l’Évangile. Le prêtre, après avoir fait un signe de croix sur le Missel, s’était signé lui-même : au front, pour dire qu’il ne rougirait jamais de la parole divine ; sur la bouche, pour montrer qu’il était toujours prêt à confesser sa foi ; sur son cœur, pour indiquer que son cœur appartenait à Dieu seul.","The mystery of love, the immolation of the holy victim was preparing. The server took the Missal, which he carried to the left, on the Gospel side, taking care not to touch the pages of the book. Each time he passed in front of the tabernacle, he genuflected sideways, throwing his waist off. Then, returning to the right, he stood with his arms crossed while the Gospel was read. The priest, after having made the sign of the cross over the Missal, had signed himself: on the forehead, to say that he would never blush at the divine word; on the mouth, to show that he was always ready to confess his faith; on his heart, to indicate that his heart belonged to God alone.","The mystery of love, the sacrifice of the Holy Victim, was about to begin. The server took the Missal, and carried it to the left side, the side of the Gospel, taking care not to touch the pages of the book. Every time he went across the tabernacle, he made a sideways genuflexion, which threw his figure quite askew. Once back on the right-hand side, he stood upright, with arms crossed, during the reading of the Gospel. The priest, after making the sign of the cross upon the Missal, crossed himself as well; on his brow, to show that he would never blush at the word of God; on his mouth, to show he was always ready to confess his faith; and on his heart, as a sign that his heart belonged to God alone.","The mystery of love, the immolation of the Holy Victim, was about to begin.

Returning to the right-hand side once more, he stood upright with crossed arms during the reading of the Gospel. The priest, after making the sign of the cross upon the Missal, next crossed himself: first upon his forehead—to declare that he would never blush for the divine word; then on his mouth—to show his unchanging readiness to confess his faith; and finally on his heart—to mark that it belonged to God alone."
"Et elle s’approcha du prêtre, à pas de loup. Quand elle fut tout près, elle lui prit le cou, elle l’embrassa.","And she approached the priest, stealthily. When she was near, she took his neck, she kissed him.","And she quietly crept up to the priest. When she was very close she clasped his neck, and kissed him.","Then she gently sidled up to the priest, passed an arm round his neck, and kissed him."
"— Mais je le vois mal, je le vois sans lumière… Il faut que je sois très fort pour aller jusqu’à la fenêtre.","""But I can't see it, I can't see it without light... I have to be very strong to get to the window.""","‘But I don’t see it well, I see it without light...

"Il sourit, il ne répondit pas d’abord. Puis il dit :","He smiled, he didn't answer at first. Then he says:",Serge smiled and did not answer at once. Then he said:,"He only smiled, and did not answer her immediately; then he said, 'I love you because you came to me."
"— Je t’aime, continua-t-il. Je ne te connais pas, je ne sais qui tu es, je ne sais d’où tu viens ; tu n’es ni ma mère, ni ma sœur ; et je t’aime, à te donner tout mon cœur, à n’en rien garder pour le reste du monde… Écoute, j’aime tes joues soyeuses comme un satin, j’aime ta bouche qui a une odeur de rose, j’aime tes yeux dans lesquels je me vois avec mon amour, j’aime jusqu’à tes cils, jusqu’à ces petites veines qui bleuissent la pâleur de tes tempes… C’est pour te dire que je t’aime, que je t’aime, Albine.","""I love you,"" he continued.

"— Vous verrez qu’elle finira par coucher dans le Paradou, murmura le vieux de son air indifférent.","""You'll see that she'll end up sleeping in the Paradou,"" murmured the old man with his indifferent air.","‘You’ll see, she’ll end up sleeping in the Paradou,’ muttered the old man, seemingly quite indifferent.","'You'll see, she will end by sleeping in the Paradou,' muttered the old man with indifference."

So you can't pass that on to me quietly!","‘That’s it, Lisa!’ cried La Teuse, ‘you might as well sit on the altar while you’re at it! Will you lower your skirts! Is it half decent to show your legs like that?... If one of you goes making an exhibition of herself, I’ll be using her branches on her face! Can’t you just pass these things to me without any fuss?’","'That's it, Lisa!' cried La Teuse; 'why don't you sit on the altar while you're about it? Just pull your petticoats straight, will you? Aren't you ashamed of behaving like that?—If any one of you lolls about I'll lay her boughs across her face.—Can't you hand me the things quietly?'"
"Et enflant les joues, tout à son jeu désormais, il chanta le De profundis. Puis, il le recommença. La partie s’acheva au milieu de cette lamentation, qu’il grossissait par moments, comme pour la goûter mieux. Ce fut lui qui perdit, mais il n’en éprouva pas la moindre contrariété. Quand la Teuse l’eut mis dehors, après avoir réveillé l’abbé Mouret, on l’entendit se perdre au milieu du noir de la nuit, en répétant le dernier verset du psaume : Et ipse redimet Israel ex omnibus iniquitatibus ejus, d’un air d’extraordinaire jubilation.","And puffing out his cheeks, completely at his game henceforth, he sang the De profundis. Then he started it again. The game ended in the midst of this lamentation, which he exaggerated at times, as if to savor it better. It was he who lost, but he didn't feel the slightest annoyance. When La Teuse had put him outside, after waking Abbé Mouret, he was heard losing himself in the middle of the darkness of the night, repeating the last verse of the psalm: Et ipse redimet Israel ex omnibus iniquitatibus ejus, d' an air of extraordinary jubilation.","Puffing out his cheeks, and paying full attention now to the game, he sang the De Profundis. * Then he started it again. The game ended with this lament, some parts of which he sang particularly loudly, as if to enjoy them more. He had lost the game, but he did not seem at all put out by that. When La Teuse had shown him out, after waking up Abbé Mouret, he could be heard, as he disappeared into the blackness of the night, repeating the last verse of the psalm: Et ipse redimet Israël ex omnibus iniquitatibus ejus* with quite extraordinary jubilation.","Then, turning his attention to the game, he puffed out his cheeks and began to chant the De profundis. When he had got to the end of it, he began it all over again. The game came to a conclusion in the midst of this dirge. It was he who was beaten, but his defeat did not seem to vex him in the least. When La Teuse had locked the door behind him, after first awakening Abbe Mouret, his voice could still be heard, as he went his way through the black night, singing the last verse of the psalm, Et ipse redimet Israel ex omnibus iniquitatibus ejus, with extraordinary jubilation."
"Et Albine était une grande rose, une des roses pâles, ouvertes du matin. Elle avait les pieds blancs, les genoux et les bras roses, la nuque blonde, la gorge adorablement veinée, pâle, d’une moiteur exquise. Elle sentait bon, elle tendait des lèvres qui offraient dans une coupe de corail leur parfum faible encore. Et Serge la respirait, la mettait à sa poitrine.","And Albine was a big rose, one of the pale, open roses of the morning. She had white feet, pink knees and arms, a blonde neck, an adorably veined throat, pale, exquisitely moist. She smelled good, she stretched lips which offered in a cup of coral their faint perfume still. And Serge breathed it in, put it to his chest.","And Albine was a big rose, one of the pale roses that had opened that morning. A rose with white feet, pink knees and arms, blonde neck, and beautifully veined breast, pale and exquisitely moist. She smelled good and held out lips that offered their scent, faint as yet, in their coral cup. And Serge breathed in her scent, and laid her on his breast.","Albine, too, was a large rose , a pallid rose that had opened since the morning. Her feet were white, her arms were rosy pink, her neck was fair of skin, her throat bewitchingly veined, pale and exquisite.

"— Bientôt vingt-six ans, répondit Serge.","""Nearly twenty-six,"" answered Serge.","‘Nearly twenty-six,’ Serge replied.","'Nearly twenty-six,' Serge answered."
"— On abîme sa soutane dans la poussière, on revient fait comme un voleur.

"— Oh ! je vous reconnais, reprit Désirée, heureuse, lâchant son tablier pour la prendre à la taille, avec sa câlinerie de grande enfant. Vous m’avez donné des merles. Ils sont morts, les chers petits. J’ai eu bien du chagrin… Attendez, je sais votre nom, je l’ai entendu. La Teuse le dit souvent, quand Serge n’est pas là. Elle m’a bien défendu de le répéter… Attendez, je vais me souvenir.","- Oh ! I recognize you, resumed Désirée, happy, letting go of her apron to take her by the waist, with her childish coaxing.

Wait, I'll remember.","‘Oh! I recognize you,’ Désirée went on, happily, letting go of her apron to give her a hug with her childlike affection. ‘You gave me some blackbirds.

La Teuse often mentions it when Serge isn't there; but she told me that I was not to repeat it. Wait a moment, I shall remember it directly!'"
"Serge y vivait seul, dans une anxiété douloureuse, étouffant davantage, couchant sur le canapé, tâchant d’échapper aux soupirs du parc, aux odeurs des vieux meubles. La nuit, les nudités des peintures lui donnaient des rêves fous, dont il ne gardait au réveil qu’une inquiétude nerveuse. Il se crut malade de nouveau ; sa santé avait un dernier besoin pour se rétablir complètement, le besoin d’une plénitude suprême, d’une satisfaction entière qu’il ne savait où aller chercher. Alors, il passa ses journées, silencieux, les yeux meurtris, ne s’éveillant d’un léger tressaillement qu’aux heures où Albine venait le voir. Ils demeuraient en face l’un de l’autre, à se regarder gravement, avec de rares paroles très douces, qui les navraient. Les yeux d’Albine étaient encore plus meurtris que ceux de Serge, et ils l’imploraient.","Serge lived there alone, in painful anxiety, more suffocating, sleeping on the sofa, trying to escape the sighs of the park, the smells of old furniture. At night, the nudity of the paintings gave him mad dreams, of which he only kept a nervous anxiety when he woke up. He thought he was ill again; his health had one last need to recover completely, the need for a supreme plenitude, for an entire satisfaction which he did not know where to go to seek. So he passed his days, silent, his eyes bruised, waking with a slight start only at the hours when Albine came to see him. They remained facing each other, looking at each other gravely, with rare, very sweet words, which saddened them. Albine's eyes were even more bruised than Serge's, and they implored him.","Serge lived there on his own, in a state of painful anxiety, suffocating even more, and sleeping on the sofa to try to avoid the sighs rising from the park and the odours of the old furniture. At night the naked figures in the paintings gave him mad dreams, of which all that remained when he awoke was a nervous uneasiness. He decided he had fallen ill again; his health needed one more thing to be fully recovered; that need was for a supreme fullness of being, an absolute satisfaction, and he did not know where it might be sought. So he spent the days in silence, with dark-ringed eyes, only coming awake with a slight start when Albine came to see him. They would stand, facing each other, with just a few tender words that made them even more unhappy. Albine’s eyes were even darker than Serge’s, and seemed to beseech him.","Serge lived there in solitude, a prey to sickening restlessness, half-stifling, lying on the couch and vainly trying to close his ears to the sighs of the soughing park and his nostrils to the haunting fragrance of the old furniture. At night he dreamt wild passionate dreams, which left him in the morning nervous and disquieted. He believed that he was falling ill again, that he would never recover plenitude of health. For days and days he remained there in silence, with dark rings round his sleepy eyes, only starting into wakefulness when Albine came to visit him. They would remain face to face, gazing at one another sadly, and uttering but a few soft words, which seemed to choke them. Albine's eyes were even darker than Serge's, and were filled with an imploring gaze."
"— Va, va, soulage-toi, serpent ! Tout à l’heure, je te casserai les reins.","- Go, go, relieve yourself, snake! Presently, I will break your back.","‘Go on, go on, get it out of your system, you viper! In a while, I’ll break your back for you!’","'Go on, go on; relieve yourself, you viper.

Serge pleurait.,Serge was crying.,Serge was weeping.,Serge was weeping.
— La gueuse est venue.,— The beggar came.,‘That trollop’s been here.’,"The Brother laid down his cards, bent over the table, and whispered close to La Teuse's face: 'That hussy has been here.'"
"Albine détournait la tête, pour ne pas voir les images, rudement coloriées, où des balafres de laque coupaient les chairs d’ocre de Jésus. Le manteau de pourpre semblait, à son cou, un lambeau de sa peau écorchée.","Albina turned her head away so as not to see the images, roughly colored, where lacquer scars cut the ocher flesh of Jesus. The purple cloak seemed to his neck a scrap of his scratched skin.",Albine turned away to avoid seeing the crudely coloured pictures on which scars of red paint cut across the ochre of Jesus’s body. The purple cloak round his neck looked like a shred of his torn skin.,"Albine turned away her head, that she might not see the crudely painted pictures, in which the ochreous flesh of Christ had been plentifully bedaubed with carmine wounds. The purple robe round His shoulders seemed like a shred of His skin torn away."
"Lui, resta muet, très malheureux, ne trouvant plus rien à dire, pour lui montrer qu’il l’aimait. Il promenait lentement le regard sur son visage rose, qui s’abandonnait comme endormi ; les paupières avaient une délicatesse de soie vivante ; la bouche faisait un pli adorable, humide d’un sourire ; le front était une pureté, noyée d’une ligne dorée à la racine des cheveux. Et lui, aurait voulu donner tout son être dans le mot qu’il sentait sur ses lèvres, sans pouvoir le prononcer. Alors, il se pencha encore, il parut chercher à quelle place exquise de ce visage il poserait le mot suprême. Puis, il ne dit rien, il n’eut qu’un petit souffle. Il baisa les lèvres d’Albine.","He remained silent, very unhappy, finding nothing more to say, to show her that he loved her. He gazed slowly over her rosy face, which fell asleep as if asleep; the eyelids had a delicacy of living silk; the mouth made an adorable crease, wet with a smile; the forehead was a purity, drowned in a golden line at the hairline. And he would have liked to give his whole being to the word he felt on his lips, without being able to pronounce it. Then he bent down again, he seemed to be looking for the exquisite place on that face he would place the supreme word. Then, he said nothing, he only had a short breath. He kissed Albine's lips.","He was silent, very unhappy at not finding anything more to say, to show he loved her. His eyes travelled slowly over her rosy face, which lay back as if asleep; her eyelids had the delicacy of living silk; her moist lips were adorably folded in a smile; her brow was a purity that merged into a line of gold at the roots of her hair. And he wanted to put his entire being into the words that he felt on the tip of his tongue, but could not speak. He leant over her once more, as if deciding on which exquisite point on that face he would lay the supreme word. Then he said nothing, but merely gave a little sigh. He kissed Albine on her lips.","Serge remained silent, sorely troubled that he could find nothing further to say to prove to her the force of his love. His eyes wandered over her rosy face, which lay upon his shoulder with the restfulness of sleep. Her eyelids were soft as silk.

He would have liked to give his whole being with the word which seemed to be upon his tongue but which he could not utter. Again he bent over her, and seemed to consider on what sweet spot of that fair face he should whisper the supreme syllables. But he said nothing, he only breathed a little sigh. Then he kissed Albine's lips."

"Mais la jeune fille, pour voir s’il était bien à elle, tout entier, l’interrogea, le ramena aux souvenirs confus qu’il tenait d’évoquer ; il ne se rappelait rien, il était réellement dans une heureuse enfance.

He could remember nothing, however; he was truly in a happy state of childhood. He fancied that he had been born the day before."
"— Pardi, dit une voix, elle l’a volé. J’ai vu Vincent qui cassait la branche, pendant qu’elle faisait le guet.","“Sorry,” said a voice, “she stole it. I saw Vincent breaking the branch while she was keeping watch.","‘You bet she has!’ said a voice, ‘she stole it. I saw Vincent breaking off a branch for her, while she kept a lookout.’","'Of course,' one of the other girls exclaimed, 'she stole it. I saw Vincent breaking it off while she kept a look-out.'"
"— Il me voit, il est content de me voir. C’est lui qui veut que je sois gai… Quand il consent à m’envoyer une récréation, il sonne la cloche dans ma carcasse. Alors, je me roule. Ça fait rire tout le paradis.","— He sees me, he is happy to see me. It is he who wants me to be gay… When he agrees to send me a recreation, he rings the bell in my carcass. So I roll. It makes all of heaven laugh.","‘He can see me, and he is pleased with me. It’s he who wants me to be merry... When he is kind enough to allow me some amusement he rings a bell in my body. Then I roll about laughing. And that makes all paradise laugh.’","'He does see me, and is pleased to see me as I am. It is His wish that I should be gay. When He wishes me to be merry for a time, He rings a bell in my body, and then I begin to roll about; and all Paradise smiles as it watches me.'"
"— O Jésus ! cria-t-il plus désespérément, soyez bon, rendez-la-moi.","“O Jesus! he cried more desperately, be good, give her back to me.","‘O Jesus!’ he cried, more desperately still, ‘be kind, give her back to me.’","'O Jesus!' he cried in desperation, 'be merciful and give her back to me!'"
"— Et le lait, chérie, tu n’as pas fini le lait ?","""And the milk, darling, haven't you finished the milk?""","‘And the milk, darling, you haven’t finished the milk?’","The milk, my dear; you have not finished the milk.'"
"Mais elle s’arrêta, à quelques pas, regardant Serge avec un étonnement ravi, frappée au cœur.","But she stopped a few steps away, gazing at Serge with delighted astonishment, struck to the heart.","But she stopped a few steps away, looking at Serge with astonished delight, struck to the heart.","But she stopped short a few steps away, heart-struck and gazing at Serge with rapturous astonishment. '"
"Elle boudait. Mais elle n’avait pas fait trente pas, qu’elle se retournait, toute rieuse. Une ronce la retenait par la jupe.","She was sulking. But she had not gone thirty steps when she turned round, all laughing. A bramble held her by the skirt.","She was sulking. But she had not gone more than thirty paces or so when she turned around, laughing. A bramble was holding her fast by her skirt.","She pouted a little, but she had not gone another thirty steps, when she turned round smiling. A bramble had caught hold of her dress."
"Cela finit par la tenter. Elle prit son élan, sauta comme un garçon, si haut, qu’elle se trouva à califourchon sur le cou de Serge. Et, le sentant chanceler, elle cria qu’il n’était pas encore assez fort, qu’elle voulait descendre. Puis, elle sauta de nouveau, à deux reprises. Ce jeu les ravissait.","It ends up tempting her. She picked up her momentum, jumped like a boy, so high that she found herself astride Serge's neck. And, feeling him stagger, she cried that he was not strong enough yet, that she wanted to get down. Then she jumped again, twice. This game delighted them.","That finally persuaded her. She took a run-up and jumped like a boy, so high that she ended up straddling Serge’s neck. When she felt him stagger, she shouted that he wasn’t strong enough yet, so she would get down. Then she leaped up again, twice more. They greatly enjoyed that game.","She was tempted to do so. She stepped back for a spring, and then jumped up, like a boy; but she felt that Serge was tottering; and crying out that she was not safely seated, she got down again. However, after two more attempts, she managed to settle herself securely on Serge's back."
"— Là, tout contre, dit-elle, étendant la main, sans cesser de sourire.","""There, right up against it,"" she said, extending her hand, still smiling.","‘Yes, just over there,’ she said, stretching out an arm, still smiling.","'Yes, just across there,' she said, pointing with her hand and still smiling."
"— Venez, monsieur, dit la Teuse qui se mit à rire, un doigt sur la bouche.","""Come, sir,"" said La Teuse, who began to laugh, one finger to her mouth.","‘Come with me, sir,’ said La Teuse, starting to laugh and putting a finger to her lips.","'Come along, sir,' said La Teuse, beginning to laugh, and raising her finger to her lips."

"Serge s’établit commodément entre deux branches, et se mit à déjeuner. Il n’entendait plus Albine ; il la croyait dans un autre arbre, à quelques pas, lorsque, baissant les yeux, il l’aperçut tranquillement couchée sur le dos, au-dessous de lui. Elle s’était glissée là, mangeant sans même se servir des mains, happant des lèvres les cerises que l’arbre tendait jusqu’à sa bouche.","Serge settled comfortably between two branches and began to have lunch. He no longer heard Albine; he thought she was in another tree, a few paces away, when, looking down, he saw her quietly lying on her back, below him. She had slipped in there, eating without even using her hands, grabbing from her lips the cherries that the tree held out to her mouth.","Serge seated himself comfortably beween two branches and began his meal. He could no longer hear Albine; he thought she was in another tree a few feet away, until looking down, he saw her, lying quietly on her back, just beneath him. She had slipped in there, and was eating without even using her hands, seizing with her lips the cherries the tree offered her mouth.","Serge settled himself comfortably between two branches and began his breakfast. He no longer paid attention to Albine. He imagined she was in another tree, a few yards away, when, happening to cast his eyes towards the ground, he saw her calmly lying on her back beneath him. She had thrown herself there, and, without troubling herself to use her hands, was plucking with her teeth the cherries which dangled over her mouth."
"— Eh ! Ce n’est pas un péché, continua-t-elle avec son bon sourire. Je l’ai servie une fois, la messe, du temps de monsieur Caffin. Je la sers mieux que des polissons qui rient comme des païens pour une mouche volant dans l’église… Allez, j’ai beau porter un bonnet, avoir soixante ans, être grosse comme un tour, je respecte plus le bon Dieu que ces vermines d’enfant, que j’ai surpris encore, l’autre jour, jouant à saute-mouton derrière l’autel.","- Hey! It's not a sin, she continued with her good smile. I served it once, the mass, in the time of Monsieur Caffin. I serve her better than pranks who laugh like pagans for a fly flying in the church… Come on, I may wear a cap, be sixty years old, be as big as a tower, I respect the good God more than these vermin of a child, whom I surprised again, the other day, playing leapfrog behind the altar.","The young priest looked at her sternly. ‘Ah, it’s not a sin,’ she went on, with her amiable smile. ‘I served the Mass once, in the time of Monsieur Caffin. I do it better than those naughty boys who laugh like heathens just at seeing a fly in the church... Come on, I may wear a bonnet, be sixty years old, and the size of a house, but I have more respect for the good Lord than those pesky children —  I even saw them the other day playing leapfrog behind the altar.’","The young priest eyed her sternly. 'Well, it isn't a sin,' she continued, with her genial smile. ' I did serve a mass once, in Monsieur Caffin's time. I serve it better, too, than ragamuffins who laugh like heathens at seeing a fly buzzing about the church. True I may wear a cap, I may be sixty years old, and as round as a tub, but I have more respect for our Lord than those imps of boys whom I caught only the other day playing at leap-frog behind the altar.'"
"Il leva la tête, il appela :","He raised his head, he called:",He raised his head and called out:,He raised his head and called: 'Albine!
"Elle se tint devant l’abbé Mouret, en commençant à manger sur le bout de la cuiller, avec précaution. Elle espérait l’égayer, le tirer du silence accablé où elle le voyait. Depuis qu’il était revenu du Paradou, il se disait guéri, il ne se plaignait jamais ; souvent même, il souriait d’une si tendre façon, que la maladie, selon les gens des Artaud, semblait avoir redoublé sa sainteté. Mais, par moments, des crises de silence le prenaient ; il semblait rouler dans une torture qu’il mettait toutes ses forces à ne point avouer ; et c’était une agonie muette qui le brisait, qui le rendait, pendant des heures, stupide, en proie à quelque abominable lutte intérieure, dont la violence ne se devinait qu’à la sueur d’angoisse de sa face. La Teuse alors ne le quittait plus, l’étourdissant d’un flot de paroles, jusqu’à ce qu’il eût repris peu à peu son air doux, comme vainqueur de la révolte de son sang. Ce matin-là, la vieille servante pressentait une attaque plus rude encore que les autres. Elle se mit à parler abondamment, tout en continuant à se méfier de la cuiller qui lui brûlait la langue.","She stood in front of the Abbé Mouret, beginning to eat cautiously from the end of the spoon. She hoped to cheer him up, to draw him out of the overwhelmed silence in which she saw him. Since he had returned from Paradou, he said he was cured, he never complained; often even he smiled so tenderly that illness, according to the people of Artaud, seemed to have redoubled his sanctity. But, at times, crises of silence seized him; he seemed to be rolling in a torture which he was putting all his strength into not confessing; and it was a mute agony which crushed him, which rendered him stupid for hours on end, a prey to some abominable inner struggle, the violence of which could only be divined by the sweat of anguish on his face. La Teuse then never left him, deafening him with a flood of words, until he had gradually resumed his gentle air, as conqueror of the revolt of his blood. That morning, the old servant foresaw an attack even more severe than the others. She began to talk profusely, while continuing to be wary of the spoon which was burning her tongue.","She stood in front of Abbé Mouret, and started to eat cautiously from the tip of the spoon. She was hoping to cheer him up, and draw him out of the devastated silence in which he seemed to be sunk. Since he came back from the Paradou, he kept saying he was cured, and he never complained of anything; indeed he often smiled with such tenderness that according to the people of Les Artaud, his illness had redoubled his saintliness. But now and again he had crises of silence, in which he seemed to writhe in some torture that it took all his strength not to acknowledge; it was a mute agony that racked him, and for hours at a time made him quite stupefied, enduring some terrible, internal struggle whose violence could only be guessed from the sweat of anguish on his face. At such times, La Teuse did not leave him alone, but battered him with a flood of words until he regained his gentle expression, that of one who had conquered the rebellion of his blood. That morning, the old servant foresaw an attack even more violent than the previous ones. She began to talk non-stop, while continuing to be careful with the spoon, which was burning her tongue.","She placed herself just in front of Abbe Mouret, and began to eat very cautiously from the edge of the spoon. She wanted to enliven the Abbe and to draw him out of his melancholy moodiness. Ever since he had returned from the Paradou, he had declared himself well again, and had never complained. Often, indeed, he smiled in so soft and sweet a fashion, that his fever seemed to have increased his saintliness, at least so thought the villagers. But, at intervals, he had fits of gloomy silence, and appeared to be suffering torture which he strove to bear uncomplainingly. It was a mute agony which bore down upon him, and, for hours at a time, left him stupefied, a prey to a frightful inward struggle, the violence of which could only be guessed by the sweat of anguish that streamed down his face. At such times La Teuse refused to leave him, and overwhelmed him with a torrent of gossip, until he had gradually recovered tranquillity by crushing the rebellion of his blood. On that particular morning, the old servant foresaw a more grievous attack than usual, and poured forth an amazing flood of talk, while continuing her wary manoeuvres with the spoon, which threatened to burn her tongue."
"— Tais-toi ! Est-ce que le jardin mourra jamais ! Il dormira, cet hiver ; il se réveillera en mai, il nous rapportera tout ce que nous lui avons confié de nos tendresses ; nos baisers refleuriront dans le parterre, nos serments repousseront avec les herbes et les arbres… Si tu le voyais, si tu l’entendais, il est plus profondément ému, il aime d’une façon plus doucement poignante, à cette saison d’automne, lorsqu’il s’endort dans sa fécondité… Tu ne m’aimes plus, tu ne peux plus savoir.","- Shut your mouth ! Will the garden ever die! He will sleep this winter; he will wake up in May, he will bring back to us all that we have confided to him of our affections; our kisses will bloom again in the flowerbed, our oaths will grow back with the grass and the trees... If you saw him, if you heard him, he is more deeply moved, he loves in a more gently poignant way, in this autumn season , when he falls asleep in his fecundity… You no longer love me, you can no longer know.","‘Be quiet! Could the garden ever die! It will sleep this winter, and wake up again in May, bringing back to us all that we have confided to it of our love; our kisses will bloom again in the flower garden; our vows will grow up again with the grass and the trees... If you could only see it, if you could hear it, it feels more deeply, and is more sweetly, more poignantly loving in this season of autumn, when it is falling asleep in its fruitfulness... You do not love me any more, you cannot understand.’","'Be quiet! As if the garden could ever die! It will sleep for the winter, but it will wake up again in May, and will restore to us all the love we have entrusted to its keeping. Our kisses will blossom again amongst the flower-beds, and our vows will bud again with the trees and plants. If you could only see it and understand it, you would know that it throbs with even deeper passion, and loves even more absorbingly at this autumn-time, when it falls asleep in its fruitfulness. . . . But you love me no more, and so you can no longer understand.'"
"— Oh ! de la pimprenelle ! dit-elle brusquement, en se jetant à genoux. C’est ça qui est bon ! Nous allons nous régaler.","- Oh ! burnet! she said abruptly, throwing herself on her knees. That's what's good ! We are going to have fun.","‘Oh, here’s some burnet!’ she suddenly cried, throwing herself on to her knees. ‘Burnet is really nice. We shall have a feast.’","'See,' she suddenly exclaimed, 'here is some pimpernel. It is very nice. Now we shall have a feast.'"
"— Tais-toi ! cria-t-il, regarde encore, écoute encore. Il faut que tu te prosternes de douleur et de pitié… Jésus succombe sous le poids de sa croix. La montée du Calvaire est rude. Il est tombé sur les genoux. Il n’essuie pas même la sueur de son visage, et il se relève, il continue sa marche… Jésus, de nouveau, succombe sous le poids de sa croix. À chaque pas, il chancelle. Cette fois, il est tombé sur le flanc, si violemment, qu’il reste un moment sans haleine. Ses mains déchirées ont lâché la croix. Ses pieds endoloris laissent derrière lui des empreintes sanglantes. Une lassitude abominable l’écrase, car il porte sur ses épaules les péchés du monde…","- Shut your mouth ! he cried, look again, listen again. You must prostrate yourself in pain and pity… Jesus succumbs under the weight of his cross. The climb to Calvary is tough. He fell to his knees. He does not even wipe the sweat from his face, and he gets up, he continues his walk… Jesus, once again, succumbs under the weight of his cross. With each step, he staggers. This time he fell on his side, so violently that he was breathless for a moment. His torn hands dropped the cross. His aching feet leave bloody footprints behind him. An abominable weariness crushes him, for he carries on his shoulders the sins of the world...","‘Be quiet,’ he said, ‘look some more, listen some more. You must prostrate yourself in grief and pity... Jesus collapses under the weight of the Cross. The climb to Calvary is very hard. He has fallen on his knees. He does not even wipe the sweat off his face, but gets up again, and goes on walking... again Jesus collapses under the weight of the Cross. At every step, he staggers. This time he has fallen on his side, fallen so hard that for a moment he is left breathless. His torn hands have let the Cross slip. His suffering feet leave bloody footprints behind him. He is crushed by an appalling weariness, for he carries on his shoulders the sins of the whole world.’","'Hush! hush!' he cried, 'look here, and here! Bow down in grief and pity——Jesus falls beneath the weight of His cross. The ascent of Calvary is very tiring. He has dropped down on His knees. But He does not stay to wipe even the sweat from His brow, He rises up again and continues His journey. . . . And again Jesus falls beneath the weight of His cross. At each step He staggers. This time He has fallen on His side, so heavily that for a moment He lies there quite breathless. His lacerated hands have relaxed their hold upon the cross. His bruised and aching feet leave blood-stained prints behind them. Agonising weariness overwhelms Him, for He carries upon His shoulders the sins of the whole world.'"
"À cela près, l’église lui parut en bon ordre. La veilleuse avait de l’huile pour la nuit, les dalles du chœur pouvaient aller jusqu’au samedi sans être lavées.","Apart from that, the church seemed to him to be in good order. The pilot light had oil for the night, the slabs of the choir could go until Saturday without being washed.","Otherwise, the church appeared to be in good order. The night lamp had enough oil to keep it going, and the flagstones of the choir would last until Saturday without being washed.","With these exceptions the church seemed to her tidy. There was oil enough for the night in the bracket-lamp of the sanctuary, and as to the flags of the choir, they could do without washing till Saturday."
"— Non, c’est ta sœur Désirée qui a eu le plus de chance.","— No, your sister Désirée was the luckiest.","‘No, it’s your sister Désirée who’s been luckiest of all.’","Correcting himself, however, with a strange smile, he added: 'No, it's your sister Desiree who has had the best luck of all.'"
"Elle ne répondit pas tout de suite, étonnée elle-même de son cri, souriant déjà de sa peur.","She didn't answer right away, surprised herself at her cry, already smiling at her fear.","She didn’t reply at once, astonished herself at her cry, and already smiling about her fear.","he said. She did not reply for a moment, surprised, herself, at her cry of fear, and already smiling at her own alarm."
"À la Croix-Verte, comme l’abbé allait traverser la route qui mène de Plassans à la Palud, un cabriolet qui descendait la rampe, l’obligea à se garer derrière un tas de cailloux. Il coupait le carrefour, lorsqu’une voix l’appela.","At Croix-Verte, as the abbé was about to cross the road which leads from Plassans to La Palud, a cabriolet coming down the ramp obliged him to park behind a heap of stones. He was crossing the crossroads when a voice called him.","At the Croix-Verte, as he was about to cross the road that leads from Plassans to La Palud, a gig coming down the slope forced him to take refuge behind a pile of stones. He was just crossing to the other side, when a voice called out:","At the Croix-Verte, as the Abbe was about to cross the highway leading from Plassans to La Palud, a gig coming down the hill compelled him to step behind a heap of stones. Then, as he crossed the open space, a voice called to him: 'Hallo, Serge, my boy!'"
— Et c’est très beau ?,"""And is it very beautiful?""",‘And it’s very beautiful?’,'And is it very beautiful?'
"Il se rapprocha, humblement.","He moved closer, humbly.","He drew closer to her, shyly.","'Well, we are lost,' said Serge, gaily; then humbly drawing near her he inquired: 'You are not afraid, are you?'"
"Albine ne sourit pas. Elle était toute blanche, avec une flamme de fièvre dans les yeux. Quelques gouttes de sang roulaient sur ses mains. Quand elle eut repris haleine, elle dit rapidement :","Albine does not smile. She was quite white, with a flame of fever in her eyes. A few drops of blood rolled down his hands. When she had caught her breath, she said quickly:","Albine did not smile. She was quite white, though with a flame of fever in her eyes. There were drops of blood on her hands. When she got her breath back, she said quickly:","Albine did not smile. Her face was very pale, and there was a feverish gleam in her eyes. A few drops of blood trickled from her hands. When she had recovered her breath, she hastily exclaimed:"
"D’abord, Vincent s’avançait, en surplis, portant la croix, une grande croix de cuivre à moitié désargentée, qu’il levait à deux mains, très haut. Puis, marchait l’abbé Mouret, pâle dans sa chasuble noire, la tête droite, chantant sans un tremblement des lèvres, les yeux fixés au loin, devant lui. Le cierge allumé qu’il tenait tachait à peine le plein jour d’une goutte chaude. Et, à deux pas, le touchant presque, venait le cercueil d’Albine, que quatre paysans portaient sur une sorte de brancard peint en noir. Le cercueil mal recouvert par un drap trop court montrait, aux pieds, le sapin neuf de ses planches, dans lequel les têtes des clous mettaient des étincelles d’acier. Au milieu du drap, des fleurs étaient semées, des poignées de roses blanches, de jacinthes et de tubéreuses, prises au lit même de la morte.","First, Vincent came forward, in a surplice, carrying the cross, a large half-silvered copper cross, which he held very high with both hands. Then walked the Abbé Mouret, pale in his black chasuble, his head erect, singing without a trembling of the lips, his eyes fixed in the distance, in front of him. The lighted candle he held scarcely stained the daylight with a hot drop. And two paces away, almost touching it, came Albina's coffin, which four peasants were carrying on a kind of stretcher painted black. The coffin, badly covered by too short a sheet, showed, at its feet, the fir tree new to its planks, into which the heads of the nails were setting sparks of steel. In the middle of the sheet, flowers were sown, handfuls of white roses, hyacinths and tuberoses, taken from the very bed of the dead woman.","At the head of the procession came Vincent, in his surplice, carrying the cross, a big brass cross which had lost half its silvering, and which he carried very high, using both hands. Then came Abbé Mouret, pale in his black cassock, his head held high, chanting, with no trembling of his lips, his eyes gazing into the distance ahead. The lighted candle he carried brought scarcely any drop of warmth to the bright daylight. And two paces away, almost touching him, came the coffin of Albine, borne by four peasants on a sort of stretcher, painted black. The coffin, barely covered by a black cloth that was too short, revealed at the foot the new pine of the planks, with the steel heads of the nails sparkling on it. In the middle of the black cloth, flowers were scattered, handfuls of white roses, and hyacinths and tuberoses, gathered from the very bed of the dead girl.","At the head walked Vincent, wearing a surplice and bearing the cross, a large copper cross, half the silver plating of which had come off. He lifted it aloft with both his hands. Then followed Abbe Mouret, looking very pale in his black chasuble, but with his head erect, and without a quiver on his lips as he chanted the office, gazing into the distance with fixed eyes. The flame of the lighted candle which he was carrying scarcely showed in the daylight. And behind him, almost touching him, came Albine's coffin, borne by four peasants on a sort of litter, painted black. The coffin was clumsily covered with too short a pall, and at the lower end of it the fresh deal of which it was made could be seen, with the heads of the nails sparkling with a steely glitter. Upon the pall lay flowers: handfuls of white roses, hyacinths, and tuberoses, taken from the dead girl's very bed."
"— Allons, du courage, répéta Albine. Tu sais que tu m’as promis de faire cinq pas. Nous allons jusqu’à ce mûrier qui est sous la fenêtre… Là, tu te reposeras.","""Come on, be brave,"" repeated Albine. You know you promised me to take five steps. We are going as far as that mulberry tree which is under the window… There you will rest.","‘Come on, be brave,’ Albine repeated. ‘You know you promised me you’d walk five steps. We’ll go as far as the mulberry tree, there beneath the window... There you shall have a rest.’","'Come now, be brave,' insisted Albine. ' You know you promised me to take five steps. We'll go as far as the mulberry tree there under the window——There you can rest.'"
"Cependant, le cabriolet suivait de nouveau le chemin creux, le long de l’interminable mur du Paradou. L’abbé Mouret, silencieux, levait les yeux, regardait les grosses branches qui se tendaient par-dessus ce mur, comme des bras de géants cachés. Des bruits venaient du parc, des frôlements d’ailes, des frissons de feuilles, des bonds furtifs cassant les branches, de grands soupirs ployant les jeunes pousses, toute une haleine de vie roulant sur les cimes d’un peuple d’arbres. Et, parfois, à certain cri d’oiseau qui ressemblait à un rire humain, le prêtre tournait la tête avec une sorte d’inquiétude.","However, the cabriolet again followed the sunken road, along the interminable wall of the Paradou. Abbé Mouret, silent, raised his eyes, gazing at the large branches stretching out over this wall, like the arms of hidden giants. Noises came from the park, the brushing of wings, the quivering of leaves, furtive leaps breaking the branches, great sighs bending the young shoots, a whole breath of life rolling over the tops of a population of trees. And sometimes, at a certain bird's cry which resembled human laughter, the priest would turn his head with a kind of uneasiness.","Now the gig was again running along the lane beside the seemingly interminable wall of the Paradou. Abbé Mouret was silent, gazing up at the massive branches that stretched out over the wall, like the arms of hidden giants. Noises came from the park, flutterings of wings, rustlings of leaves, branches giving way under furtive leapings, and huge sighs bending the tips of the young shoots, a huge breath of life rolling over the tops of a nation of trees. And sometimes the cry of a bird, sounding like human laughter, made the priest turn his head, as if troubled.","The gig once more rolled along the road skirting the Paradou's interminable wall. Abbe Mouret, still silent, scanned with upturned eyes the huge boughs which stretched over that wall, like the arms of giants hidden there. All sorts of sounds came from the park: rustling of wings, quivering of leaves, furtive bounds at which branches snapped, mighty sighs that bowed the young shoots—a vast breath of life sweeping over the crests of a nation of trees. At times, as he heard a birdlike note that seemed like a human laugh, the priest turned his head, as if he felt uneasy."
"Elle sanglotait. Lui, ardemment, écoutait, cherchant à saisir les moindres bruits lointains, attendant qu’une voix l’éveillât tout à fait. La cloche avait eu un léger saut. Et, lentement, dans l’air endormi du soir, les trois coups de l’Angélus arrivèrent jusqu’au Paradou. C’étaient des souffles argentins, des appels très doux, réguliers. Maintenant, la cloche semblait vivante.","She was sobbing. He listened ardently, trying to catch the slightest distant noise, waiting for a voice to wake him completely. The bell had had a slight jump. And slowly, in the sleepy evening air, the three strokes of the Angelus reached Paradou. They were silvery breaths, very soft, regular calls. Now the bell seemed alive.","She was sobbing. He was ardently listening, trying to capture the slightest sounds from the distance, waiting for some voice which would complete his awakening. The bell had made a little move. And slowly, through the sleepy evening air, the three strokes of the Angelus reached the Paradou. They were silvery whispers, a very soft and regular summons. The bell now seemed a living thing.","She wept, while Serge stood rooted by the breach, straining his ears to catch the slightest sound that might be wafted from the village, waiting, as it were, for some voice that might fully awaken him. The bell in the church-tower had begun to sway, and slowly through the quiet evening air the three chimes of the Angelus floated up to the Paradou. It was a soft and silvery summons. The bell now seemed to be alive."
"— Non, non, pas maintenant, reprit-elle vivement. Plus tard, je t’en reparlerai… Il y aurait de la place dans l’écurie. Une belle vache blanche, avec des taches rousses. Tu verras comme nous aurions du bon lait. Une chèvre, ça finit par être trop petit… Et quand la vache ferait un veau !","""No, no, not now,"" she went on quickly. I'll talk to you about it later... There would be room in the stable. A beautiful white cow, with red spots. You will see how we would have good milk. A goat, it ends up being too small… And when the cow would make a calf!","‘No, no, not now,’ she went on eagerly. ‘I’ll talk to you about it later... There’d be enough room in the stable. A beautiful white cow, with brown patches. You’d see what lovely milk we’d have. A goat, in the end, is just too small... And when the cow had a calf!’","'No, no, not now,' she hurriedly went on. ' We'll talk about it again later on——But there would be room in the stable. A lovely white cow with red spots. You'd soon see what nice milk we should have. A goat becomes too little in the end. And when the cow has a calf!'"
"Cependant, Albine et Serge marchaient au milieu des prairies, ayant de la verdure jusqu’aux genoux. Il leur semblait avancer dans une eau fraîche qui leur battait les mollets. Ils se trouvaient par instants au travers de véritables courants, avec des ruissellements de hautes tiges penchées dont ils entendaient la fuite rapide entre leurs jambes. Puis, des lacs calmes sommeillaient, des bassins de gazons courts, où ils trempaient à peine plus haut que les chevilles. Ils jouaient en marchant ainsi, non plus à tout casser, comme dans le verger, mais à s’attarder, au contraire, les pieds liés par les doigts souples des plantes goûtant là une pureté, une caresse de ruisseau, qui calmait en eux la brutalité du premier âge. Albine s’écarta, alla se mettre au fond d’une herbe géante qui lui arrivait au menton. Elle ne passait que la tête. Elle se tint un instant bien tranquille, appelant Serge.","However, Albine and Serge were walking in the middle of the meadows, having greenery up to their knees. It seemed as if they were walking through cool water that beat against their calves. They found themselves at times through real currents, with trickles of tall leaning stems which they heard the rapid escape between their legs. Then, calm lakes slumbered, pools of short lawns, where they dipped barely above their ankles. They played as they walked like this, no longer to break everything, as in the orchard, but to linger, on the contrary, their feet bound by the supple fingers of the plants tasting there a purity, a caress of a stream, which calmed the early brutality. Albine moved away, went and put herself at the bottom of a giant grass that came up to her chin. She only poked her head. She stood very still for a moment, calling Serge.","All the while, Albine and Serge were walking through the meadows with grass up to their knees. It felt as if they were wading through a stream of fresh water that slapped against their calves. At times they found themselves moving through real currents of grass, with tall, bowed stalks streaming by, and rushing past their legs with a sound they could hear. Then came calm and sleepy lakes, basins of short grass that scarcely came over their ankles. They played as they walked along, no longer at breaking everything, as in the orchard, but on the contrary, pausing, with their feet bound by the plants’ supple fingers, to enjoy the purity, the caress of a stream that tempered their youthful brutality. Albine moved away and went into a patch of gigantic grass that came up to her chin. Only her head was visible. For a moment she kept quite still, calling Serge:","Albine and Serge stepped along over the meadow-lands, with the grass reaching to their knees. It was like wading through a pool. Now and then, indeed, they found themselves caught by a current in which a stream of bending stalks seemed to flow away between their legs. Then there were placid-looking, slumbering lakes, basins of short grass, which scarcely reached their ankles. As they walked along together, their joy found expression not in wild gambols, as in the orchard a week before, but rather in loitering, with their feet caught among the supple arms of the herbage, tasting as it were the caresses of a pure stream which calmed the exuberance of their youth. Albine turned aside and slipped into a lofty patch of vegetation which reached to her chin. Only her head appeared. For a moment or two she stood there in silence."

"Elle lui prit une main qu’elle posa sur sa poitrine. Alors, lui, devint tout blanc. Il était plus défaillant qu’elle.

Allaient-ils donc mourir là, de ce mal inconnu ?","She took his hand and placed it on his chest. So he turned completely white. He was weaker than her. And both had tears in their eyes, seeing each other like this, without finding a remedy for their great misfortune. Were they going to die there, of this unknown evil?","She took his hand and placed it on her breast. He then went white and was nearer to collapsing than she was. Both had tears in their eyes, seeing each other in this state, without finding any remedy for their plight. Were they going to die of this unknown illness?","She took hold of his hand and laid it upon her breast. Then Serge turned quite pale. He was even more overcome than she. And both had tears in their eyes as they saw each other thus ill and troubled, unable to think of a remedy for the evil which had fallen upon them. Were they going to die here of that mysterious, suffocating faintness?"
"— Hein ? Dort-elle ? murmura la Teuse. Elle ne vous a seulement pas entendu me crier vos sottises, tout à l’heure… Dame ! Elle doit être joliment fatiguée.

She just didn't hear you yelling your foolishness at me just now... Lady! She must be pretty tired. Imagine that she cleaned her animals until almost noon... When she had eaten, she came and fell there like a shot. She didn't move.","‘My word, she certainly can sleep!’ muttered La Teuse.’ She didn’t even hear you shouting all those stupid things at me just now... Goodness, she must be quite worn out. Just think, she was cleaning out her animals until nearly midday. When she had done eating, she came in here and went off like a log. She hasn’t stirred since.’","'Lord! isn't she sleeping sound!' whispered La Teuse. ' She didn't even hear you pitching into me just now. Well, she must be precious tired. Just fancy, she was cleaning up her yard till nearly noon. And when she had eaten something, she came and dropped down there like a shot. She has not stirred since.'"
— Est-ce qu’on est venu ? demanda l’abbé Mouret.,"""Did we come?"" asked Abbe Mouret.",‘Have they come?’ asked the abbé.,'Has any one come yet?' asked Abbe Mouret.

"L’abbé Mouret ouvrit les yeux. La vision ardente d’Albine disparut. Ce fut un soulagement brusque, inespéré. Il put pleurer. Des larmes lentes rafraîchirent ses joues, pendant qu’il respirait longuement, n’osant encore remuer, de crainte d’être repris à la nuque. Il entendait toujours un grondement fauve derrière lui. Puis, cela était si doux de ne plus tant souffrir, qu’il s’oublia à goûter ce bien-être. Au-dehors, la pluie avait cessé. Le soleil se couchait dans une grande lueur rouge, qui semblait pendre aux fenêtres des rideaux de satin rose. L’église, maintenant, était tiède, toute vivante de cette dernière haleine du soleil. Le prêtre remerciait vaguement Dieu du répit qu’il voulait bien lui donner. Un large rayon, une poussière d’or, qui traversait la nef, allumait le fond de l’église, l’horloge, la chaire, le maître-autel. Peut-être était-ce la grâce qui lui revenait sur ce sentier de lumière, descendant du ciel ? Il s’intéressait aux atomes allant et venant le long du rayon, avec une vitesse prodigieuse, pareils à une foule de messagers affairés portant sans cesse des nouvelles du soleil à la terre. Mille cierges allumés n’auraient pas rempli l’église d’une telle splendeur. Derrière le maître-autel, des draps d’or étaient tendus ; sur les gradins, des ruissellements d’orfèvrerie coulaient, des chandeliers s’épanouissant en gerbes de clartés, des encensoirs où brûlait une braise de pierreries, des vases sacrés peu à peu élargis, avec des rayonnements de comètes ; et, partout, c’était une pluie de fleurs lumineuses au milieu de dentelles volantes, des nappes, des bouquets, des guirlandes de roses, dont les cœurs en s’ouvrant laissaient tomber des étoiles. Jamais il n’avait souhaité une pareille richesse pour sa pauvre église. Il souriait, il faisait le rêve de fixer là ces magnificences, il les arrangeait à son gré. Lui, aurait préféré voir les rideaux de drap d’or attachés plus haut ; les vases lui paraissaient aussi trop négligemment jetés ; il ramassait encore les fleurs perdues, renouant les bouquets, donnant aux guirlandes une courbe molle. Mais quel émerveillement, lorsque toute cette pompe était ainsi étalée ! Il devenait le pontife d’une église d’or. Les évêques, les princes, des femmes traînant des manteaux royaux, des foules dévotes, le front dans la poussière, la visitaient, campaient dans la vallée, attendaient des semaines à la porte, avant de pouvoir entrer. On lui baisait les pieds, parce que ses pieds, eux aussi, étaient en or, et qu’ils accomplissaient des miracles. L’or montait jusqu’à ses genoux. Un cœur d’or battait dans sa poitrine d’or avec un son musical si clair, que les foules, du dehors, l’entendaient. Alors, un orgueil immense le ravissait. Il était idole.","Father Mouret opened his eyes. Albine's fiery vision disappeared. It was a sudden, unexpected relief. He could cry. Slow tears cooled his cheeks, while he took a deep breath, still not daring to move for fear of being caught in the back of the neck. He still heard a wild growl behind him. Then, it was so sweet not to suffer so much anymore, that he forgot himself to taste this well-being. Outside, the rain had stopped. The sun was setting in a great red glow, which seemed to hang pink satin curtains from the windows. The church now was warm, alive with the last breath of the sun. The priest vaguely thanked God for the respite he was willing to give him. A broad ray, a dust of gold, which crossed the nave, lit up the back of the church, the clock, the pulpit, the high altar. Perhaps it was the grace that returned to him on this path of light, descending from the sky? He was interested in the atoms moving back and forth along the beam with prodigious speed, like a crowd of busy messengers constantly carrying news from the sun to the earth. A thousand lighted candles would not have filled the church with such splendour. Behind the high altar, sheets of gold were stretched; on the steps, streams of goldsmithery flowed, candlesticks blooming in sheaves of light, censers in which burned an ember of precious stones, sacred vessels gradually enlarged, with rays of comets; and everywhere there was a shower of luminous flowers amidst flying laces, tablecloths, bouquets, garlands of roses, from whose hearts as they opened, stars fell. He had never wished for such wealth for his poor church. He smiled, he dreamed of fixing these magnificences there, he arranged them as he pleased. He would have preferred to see the curtains of gold cloth tied higher; the vases also seemed to him too carelessly thrown; he was still picking up the lost flowers, retyping the bouquets, giving the garlands a soft curve. But what amazement, when all this pomp was thus displayed! He was becoming the pontiff of a golden church. Bishops, princes, women dragging royal cloaks, devout crowds, foreheads in the dust, visited it, camped in the valley, waited weeks at the gate, before they could enter. They kissed his feet, because his feet, too, were of gold, and they worked miracles. The gold was up to his knees. A heart of gold beat in his golden chest with a musical sound so clear that the crowds outside could hear it. Then, an immense pride ravished him. He was an idol.","Abbé Mouret opened his eyes. The burning vision of Albine disappeared. It was a sudden, unhoped-for moment of relief, and he was able to weep. Slow tears cooled his cheeks, while he took long breaths, not yet daring to move for fear of being caught again by the neck. He could still hear a wild growling behind his back. Then it was so sweet to be suffering less intensely that he allowed himself to enjoy this moment of relief. Outside, the rain had stopped. The sun was setting in a vast red glow that seemed to paint the windows with curtains of pink satin. The church now was warm and alive, with this last breath of the sun. The priest confusedly thanked God for the respite he had allowed him. One wide ray of light, like a golden mist, went across the nave and lit up the far end of the church, the clock, the pulpit, the main altar. Was this, perhaps, grace coming back to him on this path of light coming down from Heaven? He looked intently at the atoms toing and froing with amazing speed along the ray of light, like a host of busy messengers endlessly bearing news of the sun to the earth. A thousand lighted candles would not have filled the church with such splendour. Behind the main altar hung curtains of gold, and over the whole church flowed streams of golden jewels, candlesticks blossoming into sheaves of bright light, censers burning with glowing gems, sacred vessels gradually enlarged and gleaming like comets; and everywhere there was a shower of luminous flowers falling over fluttering lace, and pools, bouquets, and garlands of roses, whose hearts, as they opened, let fall stars. Never had he even wished for such riches for his poor church. He smiled, dreaming of fixing all this magnificence where it was, and arranging it as he pleased. He would have liked to see the cloth-of-gold curtains hanging higher up; the sacred vessels seemed to be scattered rather carelessly; he picked up the flowers that had fallen, tying the bouquets together again, and giving the garlands a gentle curve. But how marvellous it was to see all this splendour spread out before him! He became the pontiff of a church of gold. Bishops, princes, women with royal cloaks, crowds of believers, their heads bowed in the dust, came to see the church, camped in the valley, waiting at the door for weeks before being able to enter. People kissed his feet, because his feet too were gold, and they performed miracles. The gold went up to his knees. A golden heart beat in his golden breast, with a musical sound so clear that the crowds outside could hear it. Then an immense organ filled him with delight. He was an idol.","Abbe Mouret opened his eyes again. The burning apparition of Albine vanished. It was sudden and unexpected solace. He was able to weep. Tears flowed slowly and refreshingly down his cheeks, and he drew a long breath, still fearing to move, lest the Evil One should again grip him by the neck, for he yet thought that he heard the snarl of a beast behind him. And then he found such pleasure in the cessation of his sufferings that his one thought was to prolong the enjoyment of it. Outside the rain had ceased falling. The sun was setting in a vast crimson glow, which spread across the windows like curtains of rose-coloured satin. The church was quite warm and bright in the parting breath of the sinking luminary. The priest thanked God for the respite He had been pleased to vouchsafe to him. A broad ray of light, like a beam of gold-dust, streamed through the nave and illumined the far end of the building, the clock, the pulpit, and the high altar. Perhaps the Divine grace was returning to him from heaven along that radiant path. He watched with interest the atoms that came and went with prodigious speed through the ray, like a swarm of busy messengers ever hastening with news from the sun to the earth. A thousand lighted candles would not have filled the church with such splendour. Curtains of cloth-of-gold seemed to hang behind the high altar; treasures of the goldsmith's art covered all the ledges; candle-holders arose in dazzling sheaves; censers glowed full of burning gems; sacred vases gleamed like fiery comets; and around all there seemed to be a rain of luminous flowers amidst waving lacework—beds, bouquets, and garlands of roses, from whose expanding petals dropped showers of stars. Never had Abbe Mouret desired such magnificence for his poor church. He smiled, and dreamt of how he might retain all that splendour there, and then arrange it most effectively. He would have preferred to see the curtains of cloth-of-gold hung rather higher; the vases, too, needed more careful arrangement; and he thought that the bouquets of flowers might be tied up more neatly, and the garlands be more regularly shaped. Yet how wondrously magnificent it all was! He was the pontiff of a church of gold. Bishops, princes, princesses, arrayed in royal mantles, multitudes of believers, bending to the ground, were coming to visit it, encamping in the valley, waiting for weeks at the door until they should be able to enter. They kissed his feet, for even his feet had turned to gold, and worked miracles. The bath of gold mounted to his knees. A golden heart was beating within his golden breast, with so clear a musical pulsation that the waiting crowds could hear it from outside. Then a feeling of overweening pride seized upon him. He was an idol."
"Lui, terrifié, ne put répondre. Un pas lourd, derrière la muraille, faisait rouler les cailloux. C’était comme l’approche lente d’un grognement de colère. Albine ne s’était pas trompée, quelqu’un était là, troublant la paix des taillis d’une haleine jalouse. Alors, tous deux voulurent se cacher derrière une broussaille, pris d’un redoublement de honte. Mais déjà, debout au seuil de la brèche, Frère Archangias les voyait.","He, terrified, could not answer. A heavy step behind the wall made the pebbles roll. It was like the slow approach of an angry growl. Albine was not mistaken, someone was there, disturbing the peace of the copses with a jealous breath.

But already, standing at the threshold of the breach, Brother Archangias saw them.","He, in his terror, could not reply. A heavy footstep on the other side of the wall was making the stones roll about. It was like the slow approach of a growl of rage. Albine had not been mistaken, someone was there, disturbing the peace of the thickets with eager breath. Then both tried to hide behind the bushes, gripped by a redoubling of shame. But already, standing at the edge of the breach, Brother Archangias was looking at them.","He was too terrified to answer her. A heavy step set the pebbles rolling on the other side of the wall. A growl of anger seemed to draw nigh. Albine had not been mistaken. Some one was, indeed, there, disturbing the woodland quiet with jealous inquisition. Then both Albine and Serge, as if overwhelmed with shame, sought to bide themselves behind a bush. But Brother Archangias, standing in front of the breach, could already see them."

"Et, au bout d’un silence, émerveillée des coups de dents de cette grande enfant, elle reprit, s’adressant au prêtre :","And, after a silence, marveling at the bites of this big child, she went on, addressing the priest:","And after a brief silence, marvelling at the eager munching of that big child, she spoke again, this time to the priest:","Then, after a moment's silence, looking with admiration at the girl's big bites, she said to the priest: 'It is quite a pleasure to see her."
"L’abbé Mouret dormit d’un sommeil de plomb. Lorsqu’il ouvrit les yeux, plus tard que de coutume, il se trouva la face et les mains baignées de larmes ; il avait pleuré toute la nuit, en dormant. Il ne dit point sa messe, ce matin-là. Malgré son long repos, sa lassitude de la veille au soir était devenue telle, qu’il demeura jusqu’à midi dans sa chambre, assis sur une chaise, au pied de son lit. La stupeur, qui l’envahissait de plus en plus, lui ôtait jusqu’à la sensation de la souffrance. Il n’éprouvait plus qu’un grand vide ; il restait soulagé, amputé, anéanti. La lecture de son bréviaire lui coûta un suprême effort ; le latin des versets lui paraissait une langue barbare, dont il ne parvenait même plus à épeler les mots. Puis, le livre jeté sur le lit, il passa des heures à regarder la campagne par la fenêtre ouverte, sans avoir la force de venir s’accouder à la barre d’appui. Au loin, il apercevait le mur blanc du Paradou, un mince trait pâle courant à la crête des hauteurs, parmi les taches sombres des petits bois de pins. À gauche, derrière un de ces bois, se trouvait la brèche ; il ne la voyait pas, mais il la savait là ; il se souvenait des moindres bouts de ronce épars au milieu des pierres. La veille encore, il n’aurait point osé lever ainsi les regards sur cet horizon redoutable. Mais, à cette heure, il s’oubliait impunément à reprendre, après chaque bouquet de verdure, le fil interrompu de la muraille, pareille au liséré d’une jupe accroché à tous les buissons. Cela n’activait même pas le battement de ses veines. La tentation, comme dédaigneuse de la pauvreté de son sang, avait abandonné sa chair lâche. Elle le laissait incapable d’une lutte, dans la privation de la grâce, n’ayant même plus la passion du péché, prêt à accepter par hébétement tout ce qu’il repoussait furieusement la veille.","Abbé Mouret slept soundly. When he opened his eyes, later than usual, he found his face and hands bathed in tears; he had been crying all night, while sleeping. He did not say his mass that morning. Despite his long rest, his weariness from the previous evening had become such that he remained in his room until noon, seated on a chair at the foot of his bed. Stupor, which invaded him more and more, deprived him even of the sensation of suffering. He only felt a great emptiness; he remained relieved, amputated, annihilated. The reading of his breviary cost him a supreme effort; the Latin of the verses seemed to him a barbaric language, the words of which he could no longer even manage to spell. Then, the book thrown on the bed, he spent hours looking at the countryside through the open window, without having the strength to come and lean on the handrail. In the distance he could see the white wall of the Paradou, a thin pale line running along the crest of the heights, among the dark spots of the little pine woods. To the left, behind one of these woods, was the breach; he did not see her, but he knew she was there; he remembered the smallest bits of brambles scattered among the stones. The day before, he would not have dared to raise his eyes thus to this formidable horizon. But at this hour he forgot himself with impunity to resume, after each bouquet of greenery, the interrupted thread of the wall, like the edging of a skirt hanging from all the bushes. It didn't even get his veins pounding. Temptation, as disdainful of the poverty of his blood, had abandoned his loose flesh. She left him incapable of a struggle, in the privation of grace, no longer even having the passion for sin, ready to accept out of stupefaction all that he had furiously rejected the day before.","Abbé Mouret slept like a log. When he opened his eyes, rather later than usual, he found his face and hands bathed in tears; he had wept all night long in his sleep. He did not say Mass that morning. In spite of his long rest, his tiredness of the previous evening was such that he stayed in his room until midday, sitting on a chair at the foot of his bed. The torpor, which he was experiencing more and more frequently, took away even his sense of suffering. He now felt only a great emptiness, as if relieved of a burden, amputated and annihilated. Reading his breviary required a supreme effort; the Latin of the verses seemed to him a barbarous language, whose words he now could not even spell out. Then, throwing the book on the bed, he spent hours looking at the countryside through the open window, without the strength to go and lean on the sill. In the distance he could see the white wall of the Paradou, a thin, pale line, running along the crest of the high ground, between the dark patches of the little pinewoods. On the left, behind one of those woods, was the breach in the wall; he could not see it but knew it was there; he remembered even the smallest bits of bramble scattered among the stones. Even the day before, he would not have dared to gaze in this way at that challenging horizon. But now he could with impunity let himself pick out again the broken thread of the wall behind the patches of greenery, like the edging of a skirt caught on the bushes. This did not even provoke a faster beating of his heart. As though contemptuous of the thinness of his blood, temptation had abandoned his cowardly flesh. It had left him incapable of struggle, deprived of grace as he was, no longer even feeling the passion of sin, and ready, in his torpor, to accept everything he had rejected so furiously the day before.","That night Abbe Mouret slept very heavily. When he opened his eyes in the morning, later than usual, his face and hands were wet with tears. He had been weeping all through the night while he slept. He did not say his mass that day. In spite of his long rest, he had not recovered from his excessive weariness of the previous evening, and he remained in his bedroom till noon, sitting in a chair at the foot of his bed. The condition of stupor into which he more and more deeply sank, took all sensation of suffering away from him. He was conscious only of a great void and blank as he sat there overpowered and benumbed. Even to read his breviary cost him a great effort. Its Latin seemed to him a barbarous language, which he would never again be able to pronounce. Having tossed the book upon his bed he gazed for hours through his open window at the surrounding country. In the far distance he saw the long wall of the Paradou, creeping like a thin white line amongst the gloomy patches of the pine plantations to the crest of the hills. On the left, hidden by one of those plantations, was the breach. He could not see it, but he knew it was there. He remembered every bit of bramble scattered among the stones. On the previous night he would not have thus dared to gaze upon that dreaded scene. But now with impunity he allowed himself to trace the whole line of the wall, as it emerged again and again from the clumps of verdure which here and there concealed it. His blood pulsed none the faster for this scrutiny. Temptation, as though disdaining his present weakness, left him free from attack. Forsaken by the Divine grace, he was incapable of entering upon any struggle, the thought of sin could no longer even impassion him; it was sheer stupor alone that now rendered him willing to accept that which he had the day before so strenuously refused."

"L’abbé Mouret, le front de nouveau penché, ne l’interrompait pas. Elle s’était assise par terre, à quelques pas de lui, pour tâcher de rencontrer ses yeux. Elle reprit maternellement, ravie de la complaisance qu’il semblait mettre à l’écouter.","Father Mouret, his brow bent again, did not interrupt him. She had sat down on the ground, a few paces from him, to try to meet his eyes. She resumed maternally, delighted with the complacency he seemed to put into listening to her.","Abbé Mouret, his brow lowered once more, did not interrupt her. She had sat down on the ground a few steps away from him, to try to catch his eye.

"À peine pouvait-on, à la longue, reconnaître sous cet envahissement formidable de la sève l’ancien dessin du Paradou. En face, dans une sorte de cirque immense, devait se trouver le parterre, avec des bassins effondrés, ses rampes rompues, ses escaliers déjetés, ses statues renversées dont on apercevait les blancheurs au fond des gazons noirs. Plus loin, derrière la ligne bleue d’une nappe d’eau, s’étalait un fouillis d’arbres fruitiers ; plus loin encore, une haute futaie enfonçait ses dessous violâtres, rayés de lumière, une forêt redevenue vierge, dont les cimes se mamelonnaient sans fin, tachées du vert-jaune, du vert pâle, du vert puissant de toutes les essences. À droite, la forêt escaladait des hauteurs, plantait des petits bois de pins, se mourait en broussailles maigres, tandis que des roches nues entassaient une rampe énorme, un écroulement de montagne barrant l’horizon ; des végétations ardentes y fendaient le sol, plantes monstrueuses immobiles dans la chaleur comme des reptiles assoupis ; un filet d’argent, un éclaboussement qui ressemblait de loin à une poussière de perles, y indiquait une chute d’eau, la source de ces eaux calmes qui longeaient si indolemment le parterre. À gauche enfin, la rivière coulait au milieu d’une vaste prairie, où elle se séparait en quatre ruisseaux, dont on suivait les caprices sous les roseaux, entre les saules, derrière les grands arbres ; à perte de vue, des pièces d’herbage élargissaient la fraîcheur des terrains bas, un paysage lavé d’une buée bleuâtre, une éclaircie de jour se fondant peu à peu dans le bleu verdi du couchant. Le Paradou, le parterre, la forêt, les roches, les eaux, les prés, tenaient toute la largeur du ciel.","One could hardly, in the long run, recognize under this formidable invasion of the sap the old design of the Paradou. Opposite, in a sort of immense circus, must have been the parterre, with its collapsed pools, its broken banisters, its jagged stairways, its overturned statues whose whiteness could be seen at the bottom of the black lawns. Beyond, behind the blue line of a sheet of water, was a jumble of fruit trees; farther still, a high forest sank its purple undersides, streaked with light, a forest that had become virgin again, whose tops were endlessly hilly, stained with the green-yellow, the pale green, the powerful green of all essences. On the right, the forest climbed heights, planted small pine woods, died in scanty brush, while bare rocks piled up an enormous ramp, a mountain collapse barring the horizon; fiery vegetation split the ground there, monstrous plants motionless in the heat like drowsy reptiles; a streak of silver, a splash which from a distance resembled the dust of pearls, indicated a waterfall there, the source of those calm waters which skirted the floor so indolently. On the left, finally, the river flowed in the middle of a vast meadow, where it separated into four streams, whose caprices one followed under the reeds, between the willows, behind the tall trees; as far as the eye could see, patches of grass broadened the coolness of the lowlands, a landscape bathed in a bluish mist, a clearing of daylight merging little by little into the greenish blue of the setting sun. The Paradou, the parterre, the forest, the rocks, the waters, the meadows, covered the whole width of the sky.","Even looking carefully, one could hardly make out the original design of the Paradou beneath this tremendous invasion of vegetation. In front, in a sort of huge, semicircular enclosure, must have lain the parterre, the main flower garden, with its sunken fountains, broken balustrades, uneven steps, and fallen statues whose whiteness could be glimpsed deep in the expanse of dark grass. Further on, behind the blue line of a sheet of water, was a jumble of fruit trees; further still, a forest of tall trees displayed its violet undergrowth streaked with light; now returned to virgin forest, its treetops gently breasted the air one after another, splashed with the lime green, pale green, and vivid green of all the different species. On the right, the forest scaled the heights, planting little pinewoods and fading out into meagre scrub, while bare rocks piled up a huge wall like the debris of a fallen mountain that barred the horizon; eager vegetation had thrust its way into the soil, with monstrous plants that lay in the sun like sleepy reptiles. A streak of silver, a splash that from afar looked like a cloud of pearls, revealed a waterfall, the source of the quiet streams so lazily flowing alongside the flower garden. Then on the left, the river flowed through a vast meadow, where it split into four streams,* whose capricious movements could be seen under the reeds, beneath the willows, and behind the big trees. As far as the eye could see, stretches of pasture added to the freshness of the low-lying ground, a landscape bathed in a bluish haze, a gleam of daylight melting gradually into the greenish blue of sunset. The Paradou, the flower garden and the forest, the rocks and streams and meadows, filled the whole expanse of the sky. ‘The Paradou!’","Amidst that tremendous luxuriance of vegetation even lengthy scrutiny could barely make out the bygone plan of the Paradou. In the foreground, in a sort of immense amphitheatre, must have lain the flower garden, whose fountains were now sunken and dry, its stone balustrades shattered, its flight of steps all warped, and its statues overthrown, patches of their whiteness gleaming amidst the dusky stretches of turf. Farther back, behind the blue line of a sheet of water, stretched a maze of fruit-trees; farther still rose towering woodland, its dusky, violet depths streaked with bands of light. It was a forest which had regained virginity, an endless stretch of tree-tops rising one above the other, tinged with yellowish green and pale green and vivid green, according to the variety of the species. On the right, the forest scaled some hills, dotting them with little clumps of pine-trees, and dying away in straggling brushwood, while a huge barrier of barren rock, heaped together like the fallen wreckage of a mountain, shut out all view beyond. Flaming growths there cleaved the rugged soil, monstrous plants lay motionless in the heat, like drowsing reptiles; a silvery streak, a foamy splash that glistened in the distance like a cloud of pearls, revealed the presence of a waterfall, the source of those tranquil streams that lazily skirted the flower-garden. Lastly, on the left the river flowed through a vast stretch of meadowland, where it parted into four streamlets which winded fitfully beneath the rushes, between the willows, behind the taller trees. And far away into the distance grassy patches prolonged the lowland freshness, forming a landscape steeped in bluish haze, where a gleam of daylight slowly melted into the verdant blue of sunset. The Paradou—its flower-garden, forest, rocks, streams, and meadows—filled the whole breadth of sky. 'The Paradou!'"
"— Je jurerais que vous voulez me parler des réparations de l’église, dit-il, en tapant ses mains pleines de terre. Eh bien ! Non, monsieur le curé, ce n’est pas possible.

Well ! No, Monsieur le Curé, it is not possible. The municipality has no money... If the good Lord provides the plaster and the tiles, we will provide the masons.","‘I’m willing to bet you’ve come to see me about repairs to the church,’ he said, clapping his earth-covered hands together. ‘ Ah well , no, Monsieur le Curé, it can’t be done. The village doesn’t have a penny...

"Et, en phrases hachées, coupées d’incidentes étrangères au sujet, il raconta l’histoire du Paradou, une sorte de légende qui courait le pays. Du temps de Louis XV, un seigneur y avait bâti un palais superbe, avec des jardins immenses, des bassins, des eaux ruisselantes, des statues, tout un petit Versailles perdu dans les pierres, sous le grand soleil du Midi. Mais il n’y était venu passer qu’une saison, en compagnie d’une femme adorablement belle, qui mourut là sans doute, car personne ne l’avait vue en sortir. L’année suivante, le château brûla, les portes du parc furent clouées, les meurtrières des murs elles-mêmes s’emplirent de terre ; si bien que, depuis cette époque lointaine, pas un regard n’était entré dans ce vaste enclos, qui tenait tout un des hauts plateaux des Garrigues.","And, in choppy sentences, interspersed with incidents foreign to the subject, he told the story of Paradou, a sort of legend that ran through the country. In the time of Louis XV, a lord had built a superb palace there, with immense gardens, ponds, streaming waters, statues, a whole little Versailles lost in the stones, under the great southern sun. But he had only come to spend a season there, in the company of an adorably beautiful woman, who probably died there, for no one had seen her leave. The following year, the castle burned down, the gates of the park were nailed down, the loopholes of the walls themselves were filled with earth; so that, since that distant time, not a glance had entered this vast enclosure, which held a whole of the high plateaus of the Garrigues.","And disjointedly, with digressions into quite unrelated incidents, he told the story of the Paradou, which was a sort of local legend. In the time of Louis XV, a certain lord had built a splendid palace there, with vast gardens, fountains, flowing streams and statues, a real little Versailles, hidden away among the rocks, under the blazing sun of the Midi. But he had spent only one season there, with an adorably beautiful woman, who doubtless died there, for no one had ever seen her leave. The following year, the chateau burned down, the park gates were nailed up, and even the narrow slits in the wall filled up with earth, so ever since that distant era, no eye had penetrated the vast enclosure which occupied the whole of one of the high plateaux of the Garrigues.","In short sentences, interspersed with irrelevant digressions, he then related the story of the Paradou, according to the current legend of the countryside. In the time of Louis XV., a great lord had erected a magnificent palace there, with vast gardens, fountains, trickling streams, and statues— a miniature Versailles hidden away among the stones, under the full blaze of the southern sun. But he had there spent but one season with a lady of bewitching beauty, who doubtless died there, as none had ever seen her leave. Next year the mansion was destroyed by fire, the park doors were nailed up, the very loopholes of the walls were filled with mould; and thus, since that remote time, not a glance had penetrated that vast enclosure which covered the whole of one of the plateaux of the Garrigue hills."
"— Je suis la femme, répondait-elle sérieusement à toutes les révoltes qu’il tentait.","""I am the woman,"" she replied seriously to all the revolts he attempted.","‘I’m the wife,’ she replied sternly to his various efforts to rebel.","She assumed the position of mistress of the establishment, and cut Serge's bread for him, for she would not trust him with the knife."

Il y en a une pour toi, les deux si tu veux ; ou bien nous les partagerons, pour goûter à chacune… Tu me diras merci, et je t’entendrai.","- No, do not speak, if it tires you. Sit by my side.

"Le cochon entrait. Ce n’était plus le petit cochon, rose comme un joujou fraîchement peint, le derrière planté d’une queue pareille à un bout de ficelle ; mais un fort cochon, bon à tuer, rond comme une bedaine de chantre, l’échine couverte de soies rudes qui pissaient la graisse. Il avait le ventre couleur d’ambre, pour avoir dormi dans le fumier. Le groin en avant, roulant sur ses pattes, il se jeta au milieu des bêtes, ce qui permit à Désirée de s’échapper et de courir donner aux lapins les quelques herbes qu’elle avait si vaillamment défendues. Quand elle revint, la paix était faite. Les oies balançaient le cou mollement, stupides, béates ; les canards et les dindes s’en allaient le long des murs, avec des déhanchements prudents d’animaux infirmes ; les poules caquetaient à voix basse, piquant un grain invisible dans le sol dur de l’écurie ; tandis que le cochon, la chèvre, la grande vache, comme peu à peu ensommeillés, clignaient les paupières. Au-dehors, une pluie d’orage commençait à tomber.","The pig entered. It was no longer the little pig, pink as a freshly painted toy, its behind planted with a tail like a piece of string; but a strong pig, fit to kill, round like a cantor's paunch, its spine covered with coarse bristles which pissed the fat. His belly was the color of amber, from having slept in the manure. Snout forward, rolling on his paws, he threw himself into the midst of the beasts, which enabled Désirée to escape and run to give the rabbits the few grasses which she had so valiantly defended. When she returned, peace was made. The geese bobbed their necks limply, stupid, blissful; the ducks and turkeys went along the walls, with the cautious swaying of crippled animals; the hens cackled in low voices, pecking an invisible grain in the hard stable floor; while the pig, the goat, the big cow, as if falling asleep little by little, blinked their eyelids. Outside, a thunderstorm was beginning to fall.","The pig came on the scene. No longer was he the little piglet, pink as a freshly painted toy, with his rump bearing a tail like a piece of string; but a big strong pig, fit for slaughter, round as a cantor’s belly, and his back covered with rough bristles that oozed fat. His belly was amber-coloured from sleeping on the dungheap. With his snout thrust forward, he rolled along and hurled himself among the animals, which allowed Désirée to escape and run to give the rabbits the few bits of greenery she had so valiantly defended. When she got back, peace had been restored. The geese were gently lolling their necks, stupid and satisfied; the ducks and turkeys were moving off along the walls, with the careful lumbering movements of unsteady animals; the hens were quietly cackling, pecking at invisible seed in the hard ground of the stable, while the pig, the goat, and the big cow were blinking their eyes as if slowly falling asleep. Outside, a thundery rain was beginning to fall.","The pig waddled in; he was no longer the little pig of former days—pink as a newly painted toy, with a tiny little tail, like a bit of string; but a fat wobbling creature, fit to be killed, with a belly as round as a monk's, and a back all bristling with rough hairs, that reeked of fatness. His stomach had grown quite yellow from his habit of sleeping on the manure heap. Waddling along on his shaky feet, he charged with lowered snout at the scared fowls, and so left Desiree at liberty to escape, and take the rabbits the few scraps of green stuff which she had so strenuously defended. When she came back, all was peace again. The stupid, ecstatic-looking geese were lazily swaying their long necks about, the ducks and turkeys were waddling in ungainly fashion alongside the wall; the fowls were quietly clucking and peaking at invisible grains on the hard ground of the stable; while the pig, the goat, and the big cow, were drowsily blinking their eyes, as though they were falling asleep. Outside it had just begun to rain."
"— Ce bon monsieur Caffin ! Il n’était pas fier avec moi, il me parlait souvent de son péché. Ça ne l’empêche pas d’être dans le ciel, je vous en réponds ! Il peut dormir tranquille, là, à côté, sous l’herbe, car il n’a jamais fait de tort à personne… Moi, je ne comprends pas qu’on en veuille tant à un prêtre, quand il se dérange. C’est si naturel ! Ce n’est pas beau, sans doute, c’est une saleté qui doit mettre Dieu en colère. Mais il vaut encore mieux faire ça que d’aller voler.

He was not proud with me, he often told me about his sin. That does not prevent him from being in heaven, I guarantee you! He can sleep peacefully, there, nearby, under the grass, because he has never wronged anyone... I don't understand why people are so angry with a priest when he is in trouble. It's so natural! It's not pretty, no doubt, it's dirt that must make God angry. But it's even better to do that than go stealing. So we confess, and we are even!...

I really don’t understand how people can blame a priest so much, when he strays from the path. It’s so natural! It’s not right , of course, it’s a very bad thing, that must make God angry, but even so, it’s better to do that than to go thieving. There’s always confession, and then it’s all over... Isn’t that so, Monsieur le Curé, when a person truly repents, he can find salvation just the same?’","'He was very friendly with me, was good Monsieur Caffin, and often spoke to me of his sin. It won't keep him out of heaven, I'm sure. He can rest quite peacefully out there under the turf, for he never harmed any one. For my part, I can't understand why people should get so angry with a priest when such a thing unhappily befalls him. Of course it's wrong, and likely to anger God; but then one can confess and repent, and get absolution. Isn't it so, your reverence, that when one truly repents, one is saved in spite of one's sins?'"

"Cette fois, elle avait réussi à le prendre à la taille. Elle l’entraînait.

"L’abbé Mouret était resté debout, achevant sa tasse de lait, les doigts un peu rougis par la fraîcheur de la salle à manger, une grande pièce carrelée, peinte en gris, sans autres meubles qu’une table et des chaises.

"— Nous n’irons pas, reprit-elle, ne te fâche pas. Mais est-ce que tu ne préfères pas les herbes du parc à ces peintures ?

"Un matin enfin, elle put le soutenir jusqu’au bas de l’escalier, foulant l’herbe du pied devant lui, lui frayant un chemin au milieu des églantiers qui barraient les dernières marches de leurs bras souples. Puis, lentement, ils s’en allèrent dans le bois de roses. C’était un bois, avec des futaies de hauts rosiers à tige, qui élargissaient des bouquets de feuillage grands comme des arbres, avec des rosiers en buissons, énormes, pareils à des taillis impénétrables de jeunes chênes. Jadis, il y avait eu là, la plus admirable collection de plants qu’on pût voir. Mais, depuis l’abandon du parterre, tout avait poussé à l’aventure, la forêt vierge s’était bâtie, la forêt de roses, envahissant les sentiers, se noyant dans les rejets sauvages, mêlant les variétés à ce point, que des roses de toutes les odeurs et de tous les éclats semblaient s’épanouir sur les mêmes pieds. Des rosiers qui rampaient faisaient à terre des tapis de mousse, tandis que des rosiers grimpants s’attachaient à d’autres rosiers, ainsi que des lierres dévorants, montaient en fusées de verdure, laissaient retomber, au moindre souffle, la pluie de leurs fleurs effeuillées. Et des allées naturelles s’étaient tracées au milieu du bois, d’étroits sentiers, de larges avenues, d’adorables chemins couverts, où l’on marchait à l’ombre, dans le parfum. On arrivait ainsi à des carrefours, à des clairières, sous des berceaux de petites roses rouges, entre des murs tapissés de petites roses jaunes. Certains coins de soleil luisaient comme des étoffes de soie verte brochées de taches voyantes ; certains coins d’ombre avaient des recueillements d’alcôve, une senteur d’amour, une tiédeur de bouquet pâmé aux seins d’une femme. Les rosiers avaient des voix chuchotantes. Les rosiers étaient pleins de nids qui chantaient.","One morning, at last, she was able to support him to the bottom of the stairs, trampling the grass with her foot in front of him, clearing a path for him among the wild roses which barred the last steps with their supple arms. Then, slowly, they went away into the rosewood. It was a wood, with copses of tall rosebushes, spreading out clumps of foliage as big as trees, with rosebushes, enormous, like impenetrable thickets of young oaks. Formerly, there had been there, the most admirable collection of plants that could be seen. But, since the flower bed was abandoned, everything had led to adventure, the virgin forest had been built, the forest of roses, invading the paths, drowning in the wild rejects, mixing the varieties to such an extent that roses of all odors and all sparkles seemed to bloom on the same feet. Creeping roses made carpets of moss on the ground, while climbing roses attached themselves to other roses, like devouring ivy, rose in rockets of greenery, dropping, at the slightest breath, the rain of their flowers. stripped. And natural alleys had been traced in the middle of the wood, narrow paths, wide avenues, adorable covered paths, where one walked in the shade, in the perfume. One thus arrived at crossroads, at clearings, under cradles of little red roses, between walls lined with little yellow roses. Certain corners of the sun gleamed like stuffs of green silk brocaded with showy spots; certain shady corners had the contemplation of an alcove, the scent of love, the warmth of a bouquet swooning at a woman's breast. The rose bushes had whispering voices. The rosebushes were full of singing nests.","One morning she was at last able to support him to the bottom of the steps, trampling down the grass in front of him, and making a path through the wild rose bushes that barred the bottom steps with their supple arms. Then they went slowly on into the arbour of roses. It was indeed a wood, with a veritable forest of tall standard roses, spreading out leafy canopies as large as trees, and huge rose bushes, like impenetrable thickets of young oaks. In that spot, there had once been a most excellent collection of plant species. But since the abandonment of the formal flower garden, it had all gone wild, and virgin forest had established itself, a forest of roses invading the pathways in a tangle of wild offshoots, and mixing the different varieties to such an extent that roses of different scents and colours seemed to be blooming on the same stem. Rambling roses created mossy carpets, while climbing roses attached themselves to other rose trees like voracious ivy, shooting up like rockets of greenery, and at the slightest breath of wind, dropping showers of petals from their stripped flowers. New natural paths had formed in the midst of the woods, narrow alleys, and wide avenues, delightful covered passages where one could walk in the shade and the fragrance. These paths led to crossroads and clearings, went under arches of little red roses, and between walls covered with little yellow roses. Some sunny patches gleamed like swathes of green silk, patterned with bold splashes of colour; some shady parts had the seclusion of alcoves, the scents of love, and the warmth of a bouquet wilting on a woman’s breast. The rose bushes had voices that whispered. The rose bushes were full of nests that sang.","One morning she at last succeeded in helping him to the foot of the steps, trampling down the grass before him with her feet, and clearing a way for him through the briars, whose supple arms barred the last few yards. Then they slowly entered the wood of roses. It was indeed a very wood, with thickets of tall standard roses throwing out leafy clumps as big as trees, and enormous rose bushes impenetrable as copses of young oaks. Here, formerly, there had been a most marvellous collection of plants. But since the flower garden had been left in abandonment, everything had run wild, and a virgin forest had arisen, a forest of roses over-running the paths, crowded with wild offshoots, so mingled, so blended, that roses of every scent and hue seemed to blossom on the same stem. Creeping roses formed mossy carpets on the ground, while climbing roses clung to others like greedy ivy plants, and ascended in spindles of verdure, letting a shower of their loosened petals fall at the lightest breeze. Natural paths coursed through the wood—narrow footways, broad avenues, enchanting covered walks in which one strolled in the shade and scent. These led to glades and clearings, under bowers of small red roses, and between walls hung with tiny yellow ones. Some sunny nooks gleamed like green silken stuff embroidered with bright patterns; other shadier corners offered the seclusion of alcoves and an aroma of love, the balmy warmth, as it were, of a posy languishing on a woman's bosom. The rose bushes had whispering voices too. And the rose bushes were full of songbirds' nests."
"La route devenait meilleure. À la descente, les Artaud reparurent, au fond de la plaine brûlée. Quand le cabriolet coupa le chemin du village, l’abbé Mouret ne voulut jamais que son oncle le reconduisit à la cure. Il sauta à terre en distant :","The road was getting better. On the descent, the Artauds reappeared, at the bottom of the scorched plain. When the cabriolet cut the road to the village, Abbé Mouret never wanted his uncle to take him back to the vicarage.

"Cependant, l’abbé Mouret s’attardait près de la fosse, à regarder les porteurs qui attachaient le cercueil d’Albine avec des cordes, pour le faire glisser sans secousse. La cloche sonnait toujours ; mais la Teuse devait se fatiguer, car les coups s’égaraient, comme irrités de la longueur de la cérémonie. Le soleil devenait plus chaud, l’ombre du Solitaire se promenait lentement, au milieu des herbes toutes bossuées de tombes. Lorsque l’abbé Mouret dut se reculer, afin de ne point gêner, ses yeux rencontrèrent le marbre de l’abbé Caffin, ce prêtre qui avait aimé et qui dormait là, si paisible, sous les fleurs sauvages.","However, Abbé Mouret lingered near the grave, watching the porters who tied Albine's coffin with cords, to make it slide without shaking. The bell was still ringing; but La Teuse must have fatigued herself, for the blows went astray, as if irritated by the length of the ceremony. The sun was getting warmer, the shadow of the Solitaire was walking slowly, in the middle of the grass all bumpy with tombs.

The bell was still tolling, but La Teuse seemed to be tiring, for the strokes were less regular, as if irritated by the length of the ceremony. It was hotter now in the sun, and the shadow of the Lone Tree moved slowly over the grass dotted with mounds for the tombs. When Abbé Mouret at last had to move back, to get out of the way, his eyes lit on the marble tomb of Abbé Caffin, that priest who had loved, and who lay there so peaceful beneath the wild flowers.","But Abbe Mouret still lingered by the grave, watching the bearers who were slipping cords under Albine's coffin in order that they might let it down gently. The bell was still tolling; but La Teuse must have been getting tired, for it tolled irregularly, as though it were becoming a little irritated at the length of the ceremony. The sun was growing hotter and the Solitaire's shadow crept slowly over the grass and the grave mounds. When Abbe Mouret was obliged to step back in order to give the bearers room, his eyes lighted upon the marble tombstone of Abbe Coffin, that priest who also had loved, and who was now sleeping there so peacefully beneath the wild-flowers."

Il baisait chaque mèche, il se brûlait les lèvres à ce rayonnement de soleil couchant.","So she gave him the comb, she let the heavy plaits fall from her bun. It was like an unfolded cloth of gold.

He kissed each strand, he burned his lips in this radiance of the setting sun.","Then she gave him her comb, and let the heavy braids fall down from her chignon.

Mais à présent, je ne puis plus dormir, l’odeur grandit jusqu’à me suffoquer. Le soir surtout, l’alcôve est si chaude que je finirai par coucher sur le canapé.","— The other night, Serge said, I was awakened by such a penetrating perfume that I called you, thinking you had just entered the room. It looked like the warmth of your hair, when you poke strands of heliotrope in it… The first few days, it came from afar, like a memory of smell. But now I can't sleep, the smell grows until it suffocates me. Especially in the evening, the alcove is so warm that I end up sleeping on the sofa.","‘The other night,’ said Serge, ‘I was awakened by a scent so strong that I called out to you, thinking you had just come into the room.

But now I can’t sleep, the odour grows stronger and stronger until it becomes suffocating. In the evening especially, the alcove is so warm I shall end up sleeping on the sofa.’","'The other night,' said Serge, 'I was awakened by such a penetrating perfume, that I called out to you, thinking you had come into the room.

The alcove grows so hot, too, at night that I shall be obliged to lie on the couch.'"
"— Mon cher frère, reprit l’abbé Mouret, à demi tourné vers le grand Fortuné, c’est Dieu qui vous accorde aujourd’hui une compagne ; car il n’a pas voulu que l’homme vécût solitaire. Mais, s’il a décidé qu’elle serait votre servante, il exige de vous que vous soyez un maître plein de douceur et d’affection. Vous l’aimerez, parce qu’elle est votre chair elle-même, votre sang et vos os. Vous la protégerez, parce que Dieu ne vous a donné vos bras forts que pour les étendre au-dessus de sa tête, aux heures de danger. Rappelez-vous qu’elle vous est confiée ; elle est la soumission et la faiblesse dont vous ne sauriez abuser sans crime. Oh ! mon cher frère, quelle fierté heureuse doit être la vôtre ! Désormais, vous ne vivrez plus dans l’égoïsme de la solitude. À toute heure, vous aurez un devoir adorable. Rien n’est meilleur que d’aimer, si ce n’est de protéger ceux qu’on aime. Votre cœur s’y élargira, vos forces d’homme s’y centupleront. Oh ! être un soutien, recevoir une tendresse en garde, voir une enfant s’anéantir en vous, en disant : « Prends-moi, fais de moi ce qu’il te plaira ; j’ai confiance dans ta loyauté ! » Et que vous soyez damné, si vous la délaissiez jamais ! Ce serait le plus lâche abandon que Dieu eût à punir. Dès qu’elle s’est donnée, elle est vôtre, pour toujours. Emportez-la plutôt entre vos bras, ne la posez à terre que lorsqu’elle devra y être en sûreté. Quittez tout, mon cher frère…","“My dear brother,” resumed the Abbé Mouret, half turned towards the great Fortuné, “it is God who grants you a companion today; for he did not want man to live alone.

You will protect her, because God has given you your strong arms only to extend them above her head in times of danger. Remember that it is entrusted to you; it is the submission and the weakness which you cannot abuse without crime. Oh ! my dear brother, what happy pride must be yours! From now on, you will no longer live in the selfishness of loneliness. At any hour, you will have an adorable duty. Nothing is better than loving, except protecting those you love. Your heart will expand there, your strength as a man will increase a hundredfold. Oh ! to be a support, to receive a tender tenderness, to see a child annihilated in you, saying: “Take me, do with me what you will; I trust in your loyalty! And be damned if you ever left her! It would be the most cowardly abandonment that God had to punish. As soon as she has given herself, she is yours, forever. Instead, carry it in your arms, only put it on the ground when it needs to be safe there. Leave everything, my dear brother...","‘My dear brother,’ Abbé Mouret took up again, half turned towards Fortuné, ‘it’s God who grants you this day a companion, for he has not wanted man to live alone.

You shall protect her, because God has only given you your strong arms so that you can stretch them over her head in times of danger. Do not forget she is entrusted to you; you cannot abuse her submissiveness and weakness without committing a crime. Oh! my dear brother, what joyful pride must be yours! henceforth you will no longer live in the egoism of solitude. At all times you will have a delightful duty. Nothing is better than loving, unless it be protecting those you love. Your heart will expand for it, and your manly strength increase a hundredfold. Oh! to be a protector, to have a love to guard, to see a child give herself up entirely to you, saying “Take me, do with me what you will; I trust in your goodness.” May you be damned if you should ever abandon her! It would be the most cowardly desertion that God could ever punish. As soon as she gives herself to you, she is yours forever. Carry her in your arms and never put her down on the ground, until it is safe for her. Give up everything, my dear brother...’","My dear brother,' resumed Abbe Mouret, turning towards big Fortune, 'it is God who, to-day, gives you a companion, for He does not wish that man should live alone. But, if He ordains that she shall be your servant, He demands from you that you shall be to her a master full of gentleness and love. You will love her, because she is part of your own flesh, of your own blood, and your own bone. You will protect her, because God has given you strong arms only that you may stretch them over her head in the hour of danger. Remember that she is entrusted to you, and that you cannot abuse her submission and weakness without sin. Oh! my dear brother, what proud happiness should be yours! Henceforth, you will no longer live in the selfish egotism of solitude. At all hours you will have a lovable duty before you. There is nothing better than to love, unless it be to protect those whom we love. Your heart will expand; your manly strength will increase a hundredfold. Oh! to be a support and stay, to have a love given into your keeping, to see a being sink her existence in yours and say, “Take me and do with me what you will! I trust myself wholly to you!” And may you be accursed if you ever abandon her! It would be a cowardly desertion which God would assuredly punish. From the moment she gives herself to you, she becomes yours for ever. Carry her rather in your arms, and set her not upon the ground until it be certain that she will be there in safety. Give up everything, my dear brother—'"

"— Je suis prêtre, je n’ai que des prières, acheva-t-il simplement, d’une voix très ferme.","""I'm a priest, I only have prayers,"" he finished simply, in a very firm voice.","‘I’m a priest, I can only offer prayers.’","'I am a priest, and can only help with prayers.'"
"— Ah ! je ne sais pas, je ne sais pas ! dit la jeune fille, avec un geste découragé. J’ai cherché partout, je n’ai encore pu trouver nulle part cette clairière heureuse… Elle n’est ni dans les roses, ni dans les lis, ni sur le tapis des violettes.","- Oh! I don't know, I don't know! said the girl, with a discouraged gesture. I've looked everywhere, I haven't been able to find this happy clearing anywhere yet... It's not in the roses, or in the lilies, or in the carpet of violets.","‘Oh, I don’t know, I don’t know,’ said the girl, with a hopeless gesture. ‘I’ve looked everywhere, but I haven’t yet been able to find that blissful glade... It’s not among the roses, nor the lilies, nor on that carpet of violets.’","'Ah! I cannot tell, I cannot tell,' said the young girl with an expression of discouragement. ' I know nothing about it. I have searched everywhere, but I have never been able to find the least sign of that lovely clearing. It is not amongst the roses, nor the lilies, nor the violets.'"
"Il posa un instant ses cartes, se courba sur la table, lui souffla dans la figure :","He put down his cards for a moment, bent over the table, whispered in her face:","He laid down his cards for a moment, leaned over the table, and whispered right in her face:","The Brother laid down his cards, bent over the table, and whispered close to La Teuse's face: 'That hussy has been here.'"

"Et c’était ainsi qu’il était pas à pas monté jusqu’à la prêtrise. Ici, les souvenirs se pressaient, attendris, chauds encore de joies célestes. Chaque année, il avait approché Dieu de plus près. Il passait saintement les vacances, chez un oncle, se confessant tous les jours, communiant deux fois par semaine. Il s’imposait des jeûnes, cachait au fond de sa malle des boîtes de gros sel, sur lesquelles il s’agenouillait des heures entières, les genoux mis à nu. Il restait à la chapelle, pendant les récréations, ou montait dans la chambre d’un directeur, qui lui racontait des anecdotes pieuses, extraordinaires. Puis, quand approchait le jour de la Sainte-Trinité, il était récompensé au delà de toute mesure, envahi par cette émotion dont s’emplissent les séminaires à la veille des ordinations. C’était la grande fête, le ciel s’ouvrant pour laisser les élus gravir un nouveau degré. Lui, quinze jours à l’avance, se mettait au pain et à l’eau. Il fermait les rideaux de sa fenêtre, pour ne plus même voir le jour, se prosternant dans les ténèbres, suppliant Jésus d’accepter son sacrifice. Les quatre derniers jours, il était pris d’angoisses, de scrupules terribles qui le jetaient hors de son lit, au milieu de la nuit, pour aller frapper à la porte du prêtre étranger dirigeant la retraite, quelque carme déchaussé, souvent un protestant converti, sur lequel courait une merveilleuse histoire. Il lui faisait longuement la confession générale de sa vie, la voix coupée de sanglots. L’absolution seule le tranquillisait, le rafraîchissait, comme s’il avait pris un bain de grâce. Il était tout blanc, au matin du grand jour ; il avait une si vive conscience de cette blancheur, qu’il lui semblait faire de la lumière autour de lui. Et la cloche du séminaire sonnait de sa voix claire, tandis que les odeurs de juin, les quarantaines en fleurs, les résédas, les héliotropes, venaient par-dessus la haute muraille de la cour. Dans la chapelle, les parents attendaient, en grande toilette, émus à ce point, que les femmes sanglotaient sous leurs voilettes. Puis, c’était le défilé : les diacres, qui allaient recevoir la prêtrise, en chasuble d’or ; les sous-diacres, en dalmatique ; les minorés, les tonsures, le surplis flottant sur les épaules, la barrette noire à la main. L’orgue ronflait, épanouissait les notes de flûte d’un chant d’allégresse. À l’autel, l’évêque, assisté de deux chanoines, officiait, crosse en main. Le chapitre était là, les prêtres de toutes les paroisses se pressaient, au milieu d’un luxe inouï de costumes, d’un flamboiement d’or allumé par le large rayon de soleil qui tombait d’une fenêtre de la nef. Après l’épître, l’ordination commençait.","And that was how he ascended step by step to the priesthood. Here, memories crowded together, tender, still warm with celestial joys. Each year he had come closer to God. He spent the holidays holy, with an uncle, going to confession every day, taking communion twice a week. He imposed fasts on himself, hid tins of coarse salt in the bottom of his trunk, on which he knelt for hours on end, his knees bared. He stayed in the chapel during recreation, or went up to the room of a director, who told him pious, extraordinary anecdotes. Then, when the day of the Holy Trinity approached, he was rewarded beyond all measure, invaded by this emotion with which seminaries are filled on the eve of ordinations. It was the big party, the sky opening to let the chosen ones climb a new degree. He, a fortnight in advance, took to bread and water. He closed the curtains of his window, so as not to even see the light of day, prostrating himself in the darkness, begging Jesus to accept his sacrifice. The last four days, he was seized with anguish, with terrible scruples which threw him out of bed, in the middle of the night, to knock on the door of the foreign priest leading the retreat, some barefooted Carmelite, often a converted Protestant. , about which ran a wonderful story. He gave her a long general confession of his life, his voice broken by sobs. Absolution alone calmed him, refreshed him, as if he had taken a bath of grace. He was quite white on the morning of the big day; he was so keenly aware of this whiteness that he seemed to shed light around him. And the bell of the seminary rang with its clear voice, while the smells of June, the forties in bloom, the mignonettes, the heliotropes, came over the high wall of the courtyard. In the chapel, the parents were waiting, in full dress, so moved that the women were sobbing under their veils. Then came the procession: the deacons, who were about to receive the priesthood, in golden chasubles; the sub-deacons, in dalmatic; the understated, the tonsures, the surplice flowing over the shoulders, the black bar in hand. The organ rumbled, blooming the flute notes of a song of joy. At the altar, the bishop, assisted by two canons, officiated, crosier in hand. The chapter was there, the priests of all the parishes thronged together, amidst an unheard-of luxury of costumes, a blaze of gold lit by the broad ray of sunlight which fell from a window in the nave. After the epistle, the ordination began.","In this way he had mounted step by step to the priesthood. And at this point, memories rushed at him, tender and still warm with celestial joy. Every year, he had moved nearer to God. He spent his holidays with an uncle, in a most devout manner, going to confession every day, and taking Mass twice a week. He imposed periods of fasting on himself, and concealed in the bottom of his trunk some boxes of coarse salt, on which he would kneel, with bare knees, for hours together. At recreation time, he stayed in the chapel, or went up to the room of one of the teachers, who told him extraordinary stories of piety. Then, on the feast of the Holy Trinity, he was rewarded beyond all measure, flooded with that emotion with which seminaries are always filled on the eve of ordination. This was the great feast-day, when Heaven opens to allow the chosen ones to climb one step higher. For a fortnight before the event, he had put himself on bread and water. And he closed the curtains of his window so as not even to see daylight, prostrating himself in the darkness, begging Jesus to accept his sacrifice. On the last four days, he was seized by terrible anguish, frightful scruples that got him out of bed in the middle of the night, to knock on the door of the foreign priest in charge of the retreat, some barefoot Carmelite,* perhaps a converted Protestant, about whom some wonderful story was going around. To him he made a full confession of his whole life, his voice often breaking into sobs. Absolution alone calmed and refreshed him, as if he had bathed in grace. On the morning of the great day, he was absolutely white; he was so aware of that whiteness that he felt as if he were spreading light around himself. And the seminary bell rang out with its clear voice, while the scents of June, of sweet-scented stock, mignonette, and heliotrope, drifted over the high wall of the yard. In the chapel, the relatives waited, all dressed up, and so moved that the women were sobbing behind their veils. Then came the procession: the deacons, who were about to become priests, in their gold chasubles, the subdeacons in their dalmatics;* the minor orders and the tonsured, with their surplices floating out from their shoulders, and their black birettas in their hands. The organ made itself heard, spreading flute-like notes with a hymn of joy. At the altar, the bishop officiated, crozier in hand, assisted by two canons. The whole chapter was there; the priests from all the parishes were crowded together in an unheard-of abundance of costumes, in a dazzle of gold, lit by the broad ray of sunlight falling from a window in the nave. After the Epistle, the ordination began.","Such was the manner in which he had ascended step by step to the priesthood. And here his recollections thronged more quickly on him, softer, still warm with heavenly joy. Each year he had drawn nearer to God. His vacations had been spent in holy fashion at an uncle's, in confessions every day and communions twice a week. He would lay fasts upon himself, hide rock-salt inside his trunk, and kneel on it with bared knees for hours together. At recreation time he remained in chapel, or went up to the room of one of the directors, who told him pious and extraordinary stories. Then, as the fast of the Holy Trinity drew nigh, he was rewarded beyond all measure, overwhelmed by the stirring emotion which pervades all seminaries on the eve of ordinations. This was the great festival of all, when the sky opened to allow the elect to rise another step nearer unto God. For a fortnight in advance he imposed a bread and water diet on himself. He closed his window blinds so that he might not see the daylight at all, and he prostrated himself in the gloom to implore Jesus to accept his sacrifice. During the last four days he suffered torturing pangs, terrible scruples, which would force him from his bed in the middle of the night to knock at the door of some strange priest giving the Retreat—some barefooted Carmelite, or often a converted Protestant respecting whom some wonderful story was current. To him he would make at great length a general confession of his whole life in a voice choking with sobs. Absolution alone quieted him, refreshed him, as if he had enjoyed a bath of grace. On the morning of the great day he felt wholly white; and so vividly was he conscious of his whiteness that he seemed to himself to shed light around him. The seminary bell rang out in clear notes, while all the scents of June—the perfume of blossoming stocks, of mignonette and of heliotropes—came over the lofty courtyard wall. In the chapel relatives were waiting in their best attire, so deeply moved that the women sobbed behind their veils. Next came the procession—the deacons about to receive their priesthood in golden chasubles, the sub-deacons in dalmatics, those in minor orders and the tonsured with their surplices floating on their shoulders and their black birettas in their hands. The organ rolled diffusing the flutelike notes of a canticle of joy. At the altar, the bishop officiated, staff in hand, assisted by two canons. All the Chapter were there, the priests of all the parishes thronged thick amid a dazzling wealth of apparel, a flaring of gold beneath a broad ray of sunlight falling from a window in the nave. The epistle over, the ordination began."
"— Jésus qui êtes mort pour nous, cria-t-il, dites-lui donc notre néant ! Dites-lui que nous sommes poussière, ordure, damnation ! Ah ! tenez ! permettez que je couvre ma tête d’un cilice, que je pose mon front à vos pieds, que je reste là immobile, jusqu’à ce que la mort me pourrisse. La terre n’existera plus. Le soleil sera éteint. Je ne verrai plus, je ne sentirai plus, je n’entendrai plus. Rien de ce monde misérable ne viendra déranger mon âme de votre adoration.","""Jesus who died for us,"" he cried, ""tell him our nothingness!"" Tell him we are dust, filth, damnation!

The sun will be extinguished. I shall no longer see, no longer feel, no longer hear. Nothing in this wretched world will come to distract my soul from worshipping you.’","'O Jesus, Who hast died for us!' cried the priest, 'convince her of our nothingness! Tell her that we are but dust, rottenness, and damnation! Ah! suffer that I may hide my head in a hair-cloth and rest it against Thy feet and stay there, motionless, until I rot away in death. The earth will no longer exist for me. The sun will no longer shine. I shall see nothing more, feel nothing, hear nothing. Nought of all this wretched world will come to turn my soul from its adoration of Thee.'"
"— C’est votre faute ! cria-t-il. Vous auriez dû m’aider, et à nous deux nous l’aurions étranglé.","- It's your fault ! he shouted. You should have helped me, and the two of us would have strangled him.","‘It’s your fault,’ he cried. ‘You should have helped me, the two of us together would have strangled him.’","It was all your fault,' he cried; 'you ought to have helped me, and, between us, we could have strangled him.'"
"Cette plaisanterie de paysan incrédule le fit éclater d’un rire énorme. Il se frappa sur les cuisses, toussa, faillit étrangler.","This incredulous peasant joke made him burst into a huge laugh. He slapped his thighs, coughed, nearly strangled.","This joke of his made the non-believer peasant burst out in a huge laugh. He slapped his sides, coughed, and almost choked.","At this jest of his the unbelieving peasant burst into a loud guffaw, slapped his thighs, coughed, and almost choked himself."

"Ils ne savaient dans quel coin perdu du parc ils étaient. D’ordinaire, cela les égayait, d’ignorer où leur caprice les poussait. Cette fois, ils éprouvaient un trouble, un embarras singulier.

— Tu as donc renoncé à chercher ton arbre ?,"""So you've given up looking for your tree?""",‘So you’ve given up trying to find your tree?’,"And when he saw Albine shrug her shoulders with a weary air, he added, in a teasing kind of way, 'You have got tired of looking for your tree, then?'"

"L’église était silencieuse. Seule, la pluie, qui redoublait, mettait sous la nef un frisson d’orgue. Dans ce calme brusque, la colère du prêtre tomba ; il se sentit pris d’un attendrissement.

"L’abbé Mouret s’avança. Il crut voir, en effet, derrière un genévrier, la jupe orange d’Albine.

"Une paresse engourdissait peu à peu l’abbé Mouret. Le soleil montant le baignait d’une telle tiédeur, qu’il se laissait aller contre la porte de l’église, envahi par une paix heureuse. Il songeait à ce village des Artaud, poussé là, dans les pierres, ainsi qu’une des végétations noueuses de la vallée. Tous les habitants étaient parents, tous portaient le même nom, si bien qu’ils prenaient des surnoms dès le berceau, pour se distinguer entre eux. Un ancêtre, un Artaud, était venu, qui s’était fixé dans cette lande, comme un paria ; puis, sa famille avait grandi, avec la vitalité farouche des herbes suçant la vie des rochers ; sa famille avait fini par être une tribu, une commune, dont les cousinages se perdaient, remontaient à des siècles. Ils se mariaient entre eux, dans une promiscuité éhontée ; on ne citait pas un exemple d’un Artaud ayant amené une femme d’un village voisin ; les filles seules s’en allaient, parfois. Ils naissaient, ils mouraient, attachés à ce coin de terre, pullulant sur leur fumier, lentement, avec une simplicité d’arbres qui repoussaient de leur semence, sans avoir une idée nette du vaste monde, au delà de ces roches jaunes, entre lesquelles ils végétaient. Et pourtant déjà, parmi eux, se trouvaient des pauvres et des riches ; des poules ayant disparu, les poulaillers, la nuit, étaient fermés par de gros cadenas ; un Artaud avait tué un Artaud, un soir, derrière le moulin. C’était, au fond de cette ceinture désolée de collines, un peuple à part, une race née du sol, une humanité de trois cents têtes qui recommençait les temps.","Laziness gradually benumbed Abbé Mouret. The rising sun bathed him in such warmth that he let himself lean against the door of the church, invaded by a happy peace. He was thinking of that village of Artaud, pushed there, among the stones, like one of the gnarled vegetations of the valley. All the inhabitants were related, all bore the same name, so that they took nicknames from the cradle, to distinguish themselves between them. An ancestor, an Artaud, had come, who had settled in this moor, like a pariah; then his family had grown, with the fierce vitality of the grasses sucking the life from the rocks; his family had ended up being a tribe, a commune, whose kinships were lost, dating back centuries. They married among themselves, in shameless promiscuity; no example was cited of an Artaud having brought a woman from a neighboring village; the girls alone went away, sometimes. They were born, they died, attached to this corner of earth, swarming over their manure, slowly, with the simplicity of trees which grew back from their seed, without having a clear idea of the vast world, beyond these yellow rocks, between which they vegetated. And yet already among them were poor and rich; chickens having disappeared, the henhouses, at night, were closed by large padlocks; an Artaud had killed an Artaud, one evening, behind the mill. It was, at the bottom of this desolate belt of hills, a people apart, a race born of the soil, a humanity of three hundred heads which was beginning time anew.","A feeling of laziness gradually crept over Abbé Mouret. The rising sun bathed him in such warmth that he let himself slide back against the door of the church, overcome by a feeling of happy peacefulness. He was thinking about this village, Les Artaud, which had sprung up here among the stones, like one of those knotty growths in the valley. All the inhabitants were related, all bore the same name, so they were given nicknames even from the cradle, in order to distinguish one from another. An ancestor, an Artaud, had come and installed himself in this moorland, like an outcast; and then his family had grown, with the savage vitality of the grasses sucking up life from the rocks; his family had ended up as a tribe, a community, in which relationships became confused and went back over centuries. They intermarried with shameless promiscuity; there was no mention of any Artaud bringing a wife from any neighbouring village; only the daughters, sometimes, went away. They were born and died, rooted in this bit of the world, multiplying on their dungheap, slowly, with the simplicity of trees growing again from their seed, with no idea at all of the vast world that lay beyond these yellowish rocks among which they vegetated. And yet they already had their rich and poor. Ever since the time some hens disappeared, the henhouses were locked at night with large padlocks; and one night, behind the mill, an Artaud had killed another Artaud. In the depths of this desolate band of hills, this was a race apart, a tribe born of the soil, a whole humanity of three hundred head, starting again as if at the beginning of time.","Languor slowly stole over Abbe Mouret. The rising sun steeped him in such warmth that he leant back against the church door pervaded by a feeling of happy restfulness. His thoughts were dwelling on that hamlet of Les Artaud, which had sprung up there among the stones like one of the knotty growths of the valley. All its inhabitants were related, all bore the same name, so that from their very cradle they were distinguished among themselves by nicknames. An Artaud, their ancestor, had come hither and settled like a pariah in this waste. His family had grown with all the wild vitality of the herbage that sucked life from the rocky boulders. It had at last become a tribe, a rural community, in which cousin-ships were lost in the mists of centuries. They intermarried with shameless promiscuity. Not an instance could be cited of any Artaud taking himself a wife from any neighbouring village; only some of the girls occasionally went elsewhere. The others were born and died fixed to that spot, leisurely increasing and multiplying on their dunghills with the irreflectiveness of trees, and with no definite notion of the world that lay beyond the tawny rocks, in whose midst they vegetated. And yet there were already rich and poor among them; fowls having at times disappeared, the fowl-houses were now closed at night with stout padlocks; moreover one Artaud had killed another Artaud one evening behind the mill. These folk, begirt by that belt of desolate hills, were truly a people apart—a race sprung from the soil, a miniature replica of mankind, three hundred souls all told, beginning the centuries yet once again."
"Et les grandes filles posèrent le petit à terre. La Rosalie, Fortuné et la vieille Brichet s’arrêtèrent au milieu du cimetière, tandis que Catherine suivait sournoisement Frère Archangias. La fosse d’Albine était creusée à gauche de la tombe de l’abbé Caffin, dont la pierre blanche semblait au soleil toute semée de paillettes d’argent. Le trou béant, frais du matin, s’ouvrait parmi de grosses touffes d’herbe ; sur le bord, de hautes plantes, à demi arrachées, penchaient leurs tiges ; au fond, une fleur était tombée, tachant le noir de la terre de ses pétales rouges. Lorsque l’abbé Mouret s’avança, la terre molle céda sous ses pieds ; il dut reculer, pour ne pas rouler dans la fosse.","And the big girls put the little one on the ground. La Rosalie, Fortuné and old Brichet stopped in the middle of the cemetery, while Catherine slyly followed Brother Archangias. Albine's grave was dug to the left of Abbé Caffin's tomb, the white stone of which seemed to the sun to be strewn with spangles of silver. The gaping hole, cool in the morning, opened among great tufts of grass; on the edge, tall plants, half uprooted, bent their stems; in the background, a flower had fallen, staining the black earth with its red petals. When Abbé Mouret advanced, the soft earth gave way under his feet; he had to step back, so as not to roll into the pit.","The two girls put the baby on the ground. Rosalie, Fortuné, and old Mother Brichet stopped in the middle of the cemetery, while Catherine just quietly followed Brother Archangias. Albine’s grave had been dug to the left of the tomb of Abbé Caffin, whose white tombstone seemed, in the sunshine, to be strewn with flecks of silver. The gaping hole, freshly dug that morning, lay open among thick clumps of grass; the stalks of tall plants, half uprooted, leaned over the edge; at the bottom, one flower had fallen, splashing the black of the earth with its red petals. When Abbé Mouret came forward, the soft earth gave under his feet, and he had to step back to avoid falling into the grave.","The two girls laid the baby on the ground. Rosalie, Fortune, and old mother Brichet were lingering in the middle of the graveyard, while Catherine slyly followed Brother Archangias. Albine's grave was on the left hand of Abbe Caffin's tomb, whose white stone seemed in the sunshine to be flecked with silvery spangles. The deep cavity, freshly dug that morning, yawned amidst thick tufts of grass. Big weeds, almost uprooted, drooped over the edges, and a fallen flower lay at the bottom, staining the dark soil with its crimson petals. When Abbe Mouret came forward, the soft earth crumbled and gave way beneath his feet; he was obliged to step back to keep himself from slipping into the grave."

"— Laissez donc ! Monsieur le curé, dit le paysan. C’était de la terre molle. J’aurais dû lui jeter ces cailloux… On voit bien que vous ne connaissez pas les filles. Elles sont joliment dures.

Anyway, they’re all like that.’","'Let be, Monsieur le Cure,' said the other. ' It was only soft earth. I ought to have thrown these stones at her. It's easy to see that you don't know girls. Hard as nails, all of them. I might duck that one in the well, I might break all her bones with a cudgel, and she'd still be just the same. But I've got my eye on her, and if I catch her! . . . Ah! well, they are all like that.'"

"Elle se tut, sentant qu’il frissonnait. Elle craignait qu’un mot trop vif ne le rendît à ses terreurs. Lentement, elle le conquérait, rien qu’à promener sur son visage la caresse bleue de son regard.

"C’était vers une heure seulement qu’un paysan, venu à Plassans pour vendre ses légumes, avait appris au docteur Pascal la mort d’Albine, en ajoutant que Jeanbernat le demandait. Maintenant, le docteur se sentait un peu soulagé par le cri qu’il venait de jeter, en passant devant l’église. Il s’était détourné de son chemin, afin de se donner cette satisfaction. Il se reprochait cette mort comme un crime dans lequel il aurait trempé. Tout le long de la route, il n’avait cessé de s’accabler d’injures, s’essuyant les yeux pour voir clair à conduire son cheval, poussant le cabriolet sur les tas de pierres, avec la sourde envie de culbuter et de se casser quelque membre. Lorsqu’il se fut engagé dans le chemin creux longeant la muraille interminable du parc, une espérance lui vint. Peut-être qu’Albine n’était qu’en syncope. Le paysan lui avait conté qu’elle s’était asphyxiée avec des fleurs. Ah ! s’il arrivait à temps, s’il pouvait la sauver ! Et il tapait férocement sur son cheval, comme s’il eût tapé sur lui.","It was only around one o'clock that a peasant, who had come to Plassans to sell his vegetables, had informed Doctor Pascal of Albine's death, adding that Jeanbernat had asked for him. Now the doctor felt a little relieved by the cry he had just uttered as he passed the church. He had turned from his path, in order to give himself this satisfaction. He blamed himself for this death as a crime in which he had been involved. All along the road, he had never ceased to overwhelm himself with insults, wiping his eyes to see clearly while driving his horse, pushing the cabriolet on the piles of stones, with the dull desire to tumble and break some limb. When he entered the sunken path along the interminable wall of the park, a hope came to him. Maybe Albine was just fainting. The peasant had told her that she had suffocated herself with flowers. Ah! if he arrived in time, if he could save her! And he beat his horse fiercely, as if he had beaten him.","It was not until about one o’clock that a peasant, who’d come to Plassans to sell his vegetables, had told the doctor about the death of Albine, adding that Jeanbernat was asking for him. The doctor now felt a little better after his shouts as he passed by the church. He had gone slightly out of his way to allow himself that satisfaction. He reproached himself for this death, as if it were a crime in which he had taken part. The whole of the way he had not stopped heaping insults on himself and having to wipe his eyes just to be able to guide his horse, driving the gig over great heaps of stones, as if secretly hoping to turn the gig over and break his bones. When he entered the lane that ran along the interminable wall of the park, he felt a sudden flicker of hope. Perhaps Albine had only fainted away. The peasant had told him that she had suffocated herself with flowers. Ah! if he arrived in time, perhaps he could save her!

He reproached himself for the death of the girl as for a crime in which he had participated.

The peasant had told him that she had suffocated herself with flowers. Ah! if he could only get there in time, if he could only save her!

"La jeune fille s’était assise. Avec des précautions infinies, elle tira de dessous sa jupe un nid de merles, où dormaient trois petits. Elle le posa sur son assiette.

"Pendant une demi-heure, elle se donna une peine infinie pour attraper des petits poissons avec les mains. Elle avait relevé ses jupes, nouées d’un bout de ficelle. Elle s’avançait prudemment, prenant des précautions infinies afin de ne pas remuer l’eau ; puis, lorsqu’elle était tout près du petit poisson, tapi entre deux pierres, elle allongeait son bras nu, faisait un barbotage terrible, ne tenait qu’une poignée de graviers.

"Le soleil était là, en effet. Quand Albine eut ouvert les volets, derrière les grands rideaux, la bonne lueur jaune chauffa de nouveau un coin de la blancheur du linge. Mais ce qui fit asseoir Serge sur son séant, ce fut de revoir l’ombre de la branche, le rameau qui lui annonçait le retour à la vie. Toute la campagne ressuscitée, avec ses verdures, ses eaux, son large cercle de collines, était là pour lui, dans cette tache verdâtre frissonnante au moindre souffle. Elle ne l’inquiétait plus.

The whole of the resuscitated countryside, with its greenery, its waters, its wide circle of hills, was there for him, in this patch of green that quivered at the slightest breath. She no longer worried him.

"Il s’agenouilla, tandis que les paysannes, avec un grand bruit de jupes, se mettaient par terre, s’asseyant sur leurs talons. Elles suivirent son oraison d’un marmottement confus, où perçaient des rires. Une d’elles, se sentant pincée par derrière, laissa échapper un cri, qu’elle tâcha d’étouffer dans un accès de toux ; ce qui égaya tellement les autres, qu’elles restèrent un instant à se tordre, après avoir dit Amen, le nez sur les dalles, sans pouvoir se relever.","He knelt down, while the peasant women, with a great noise of skirts, fell on the ground, sitting down on their heels.

They followed his prayer with a confused muttering, through which burst here and there a giggle.

"— J’avais tout calculé. C’est là le plus fort ! Oh ! l’imbécile !… Tu restais un mois en convalescence. L’ombre des arbres, le souffle frais de l’enfant, toute cette jeunesse te remettait sur pied. D’un autre côté, l’enfant perdait sa sauvagerie, tu l’humanisais, nous en faisions à nous deux une demoiselle que nous aurions mariée quelque part. C’était parfait… Aussi pouvais-je m’imaginer que ce vieux philosophe de Jeanbernat ne quitterait pas ses salades d’un pouce ! Il est vrai que moi non plus je n’ai pas bougé de mon laboratoire. J’avais des études en train… Et c’est ma faute ! Je suis un malhonnête homme !","""I had it all figured out. This is the strongest! Oh ! the imbecile!... You remained a month in convalescence. The shade of the trees, the fresh breath of the child, all this youth put you back on your feet. On the other hand, the child lost his savagery, you humanized him, the two of us made him a young lady that we would have married off somewhere. It was perfect… So I could imagine that this old philosopher from Jeanbernat would not leave his salads an inch! It's true that I haven't moved from my laboratory either. I was studying… And it’s my fault! I am a dishonest man!","‘I had thought it all out. That’s the worst of it! Oh! what a fool... You were convalescing for a month. The shade of the trees, the fresh breath of the child, all that youth around you, would get you back on your feet. And at the same time, the child would lose her wildness, you would civilize her; between the two of us we’d be making her into a marriageable young lady. It was perfect... And how was I to imagine that the old philosopher Jeanbernat would not move one inch away from his lettuces! And the fact is, neither did I move away from my laboratory... I had some work going on... And it’s all my fault! I’ve behaved very badly!’","Then, raising his voice, he added: 'I thought I had considered everything carefully, that is the most wonderful part of it. Oh! what a fool I was! You would stay there, I thought, for a month to recover your strength. The shade of the trees, the cheerful chatter of the girl, all the youthfulness about you would quickly bring you round. And then you, on your side, it seemed to me, would do something to reclaim the poor child from her wild ways; you would civilise her, and, between us, we should turn her into a young lady, for whom we should, by-and-by, find a suitable husband. It seemed such a perfect scheme. And then how was I to guess that old philosophising Jeanbernat would never stir an inch from his lettuce-beds? Well! well! I myself never left my own laboratory. I had such pressing work there. . . . And it is all my fault! Ah! I am a stupid bungler!'"

"Ce soir-là, la Teuse était d’une telle humeur, qu’elle parla d’aller se coucher, dès que la nappe fut ôtée. Mais le Frère voulait jouer.

"Le Frère resta un instant, les poings fermés, sans parler.

"Et, lorsqu’il avait tout donné à Marie, son corps, son âme, ses biens terrestres, ses biens spirituels, lorsqu’il était nu devant elle, à bout de prières, les litanies de la Vierge jaillissaient de ses lèvres brûlées, avec leurs appels répétés, entêtés, acharnés, dans un besoin suprême de secours célestes. Il lui semblait qu’il gravissait un escalier de désir ; à chaque saut de son cœur, il montait une marche. D’abord, il la disait Sainte. Ensuite, il l’appelait Mère, très pure, très chaste, aimable, admirable. Et il reprenait son élan, lui criant six fois sa virginité, la bouche comme rafraîchie chaque fois par ce mot de vierge, auquel il joignait des idées de puissances, de bonté, de fidélité. À mesure que son cœur l’emportait plus haut, sur les degrés de lumière, une voix étrange, venue de ses veines, parlait en lui, s’épanouissant en fleurs éclatantes. Il aurait voulu se fondre en parfum, s’épandre en clarté, expirer en un soupir musical. Tandis qu’il la nommait Miroir de justice, Temple de sagesse, Source de sa joie, il se voyait pâle d’extase dans ce miroir, il s’agenouillait sur les dalles tièdes de ce temple, il buvait à longs traits l’ivresse de cette source. Et il la transformait encore, lâchant la bride à sa folie de tendresse pour s’unir à elle d’une façon toujours plus étroite. Elle devenait un Vase d’honneur choisi par Dieu, un Sein d’élection où il souhaitait de verser son être, de dormir à jamais. Elle était la Rose mystique, une grande fleur éclose au paradis, faite des Anges entourant leur Reine, si pure, si odorante, qu’il la respirait du bas de son indignité avec un gonflement de joie dont ses côtes craquaient. Elle se changeait en Maison d’or, en Tour de David, en Tour d’ivoire, d’une richesse inappréciable, d’une pureté jalousée des cygnes, d’une taille haute, forte, ronde, à laquelle il aurait voulu faire de ses bras tendus une ceinture de soumission. Elle se tenait debout à l’horizon, elle était la Porte du ciel, qu’il entrevoyait derrière ses épaules, lorsqu’un souffle de vent écartait les plis de son voile. Elle grandissait derrière la montagne, à l’heure où la nuit pâlit, Étoile du matin, secours des voyageurs égarés, aube d’amour. Puis, à cette hauteur, manquant d’haleine, non rassasié encore, mais les mots trahissant les forces de son cœur, il ne pouvait plus que la glorifier du titre de Reine qu’il lui jetait neuf fois comme neuf coups d’encensoir. Son cantique se mourait d’allégresse dans ces cris du triomphe final : Reine des vierges, Reine de tous les saints, Reine conçue sans péché ! Elle, toujours plus haut, resplendissait. Lui, sur la dernière marche, la marche que les familiers de Marie atteignent seuls, restait là un instant, pâmé au milieu de l’air subtil qui l’étourdissait, encore trop loin pour baiser le bord de la robe bleue, se sentant déjà rouler, avec l’éternel désir de remonter, de tenter cette jouissance surhumaine.","And, when he had given everything to Mary, his body, his soul, his earthly goods, his spiritual goods, when he was naked before her, at the end of his prayers, the litanies of the Virgin sprang from his burnt lips, with their repeated, stubborn, relentless appeals, in a supreme need of heavenly help. It seemed to him that he was climbing a staircase of desire; with each leap of his heart, he climbed a step. First, he called her holy. Then he called her Mother, very pure, very chaste, lovable, admirable. And he resumed his momentum, crying out to her six times of his virginity, his mouth as if refreshed each time by the word virgin, to which he added ideas of power, of goodness, of fidelity. As his heart carried him higher, on the degrees of light, a strange voice, coming from his veins, spoke in him, blooming in brilliant flowers. He would have liked to melt into perfume, spread out in clarity, expire in a musical sigh. While he called it Mirror of Justice, Temple of Wisdom, Source of his joy, he saw himself pale with ecstasy in this mirror, he knelt down on the warm flagstones of this temple, he drank in long drafts the intoxication from this source. And he transformed her again, letting go of his madness of tenderness to unite with her in an ever closer way. She became a Vase of honor chosen by God, a bosom of choice where he wished to pour his being, to sleep forever. She was the mystical Rose, a great flower blooming in paradise, made of the Angels surrounding their Queen, so pure, so fragrant, that he inhaled her from the depths of his indignity with a swelling of joy that made his ribs crack. She changed into a House of Gold, into a Tower of David, into a Tower of ivory, of inestimable richness, of a purity jealous of swans, of a tall, strong, round stature which he would have liked from his outstretched arms a belt of submission. She stood upright on the horizon, she was the Gate of Heaven, which he glimpsed behind her shoulders, when a breath of wind parted the folds of her veil. It grew behind the mountain, at the hour when the night pales, Star of the morning, help of lost travellers, dawn of love. Then, at this height, short of breath, not yet satiated, but the words betraying the strength of his heart, he could only glorify her with the title of Queen which he threw at her nine times like nine blows from the censer. Her canticle was dying of joy in these cries of final triumph: Queen of virgins, Queen of all saints, Queen conceived without sin! She, always higher, shone. He, on the last step, the step that Marie's familiars reach alone, remained there for a moment, swooning in the midst of the subtle air which dazed him, still too far to kiss the edge of the blue dress, already feeling roll, with the eternal desire to go up, to try this superhuman enjoyment.","And when he had given everything to Mary, his body and soul, his worldly goods and spiritual goods, when he was left naked before her, with all his prayers done, the litanies of the Virgin would spring forth from his burning lips, with their repeated, obstinate, desperate appeals, in a supreme plea for heavenly succour. It seemed as if he were climbing a ladder of desire; with each bound of his heart he mounted one more step. First he called her Holy. Then he called her Mother, most pure, most chaste, kindly and admirable. And with renewed vigour he proclaimed her virginity, his mouth seemingly refreshed by each mention of the word ‘virgin’, to which he linked ideas of power, goodness, and fidelity. As his heart bore him ever higher up the steps of light, a strange voice, springing from his very blood, spoke within him, and blossomed into dazzling flowers. He would have liked to dissolve into a scent, to expand into light, or expire in a musical sigh. While he was calling her Mirror of Justice, Temple of Wisdom, and Spring of his Joy, he could see himself pale with ecstasy in that mirror, he knelt on the warm flagstones of that temple, and drank long, intoxicating draughts from that spring. And he went on transforming her, giving free rein to the madness of his love, to be joined in ever closer union with her. She became a Vessel of Honour chosen by God, a Bosom of Election into which he longed to pour his whole being and sleep forever. She was the Mystic Rose,* a great flower blooming in paradise, a flower made of the angels circulating around their Queen, so pure, so fragrant that her scent reached him even in the depths of his unworthiness, with such a surge of joy it almost made him burst. She changed into a House of Gold, a Tower of David, an Ivory Tower of immeasurable wealth, of a purity swans would envy, tall in stature, a strong and rounded figure, upon which he would have liked to stretch out his arms like a belt of submission. She stood erect on the horizon, she was the Gate of Heaven, which he could see behind her shoulders, when a breath of wind blew aside the folds of her veil. She grew ever larger beyond the mountain, when night began to pale. She was the Star of Morning, bringing aid to lost travellers, a dawn of love. Then he, having reached these heights, breathless but not yet satisfied, words no longer being equal to the pulses of his heart, could only further glorify her with the title of Queen, which he bestowed upon her nine times over, like nine swings of the censer. His canticle seemed to be dying of joy in these cries of ultimate triumph: Queen of virgins, Queen of all the saints, Queen conceived without sin! She, rising ever higher, shone forth in splendour. He, on the final step, the step reached only by Mary’s intimates, paused there for a moment, overcome by the rarefied atmosphere which made him dizzy, still too far off to be able to kiss the hem of the blue robe, and already feeling himself toppling, with the eternal desire to climb higher, to try to reach that superhuman state of bliss.","And when he had given all up to Mary—his body, his soul, his earthly goods, and spiritual chattels—when he stood before her stripped, bare, with all his prayers exhausted, there welled from his burning lips the Virgin's litanies, with their reiterated, persistent, impassioned appeals for heavenly succour. He fancied himself climbing a flight of pious yearnings, which he ascended step by step at each bound of his heart. First he called her 'Holy.' Next he called her 'Mother,' most pure, most chaste, amiable, and admirable. And with fresh ardour he six times proclaimed her maidenhood; his lips cooled and freshened each time that he pronounced that name of 'Virgin,' which he coupled with power, goodness, and fidelity. And as his heart drew him higher up the ladder of light, a strange voice from his veins spoke within him, bursting into dazzling flowers of speech. He yearned to melt away in fragrance, to be spread around in light, to expire in a sigh of music. As he named her 'Mirror of Justice,' 'Seat of Wisdom,' and 'Source of Joy,' he could behold himself pale with ecstasy in that mirror, kneeling on the warmth of the divine seat, quaffing intoxication in mighty draughts from the holy Source. Again he would transform her, throwing off all restraint in his frantic love, so as to attain to a yet closer union with her. She became a 'Vessel of Honour,' chosen of God, a 'Bosom of Election,' wherein he desired to pour his being, and slumber for ever. * She was the 'Mystical Rose'—a great flower which bloomed in Paradise, with petals formed of the angels clustering round their queen, a flower so fresh, so fragrant, that he could inhale its perfume from the depths of his unworthiness with a joyful dilation of his sides which stretched them to bursting. She became changed into a 'House of Gold,' a 'Tower of David,' and a 'Tower of Ivory,' of inestimable richness, of a whiteness that swans might envy, and of lofty, massive, rounded form, which he would fain have encircled with his outstretched arms as with a girdle of submissiveness. She stood on the distant skyline as the 'Gate of Heaven,' a glimpse of which he caught behind her shoulders when a puff of wind threw back the folds of her veil. She rose in splendour from behind the mountain in the waning hour of night, like the 'Morning Star' to help all travellers astray, like the very dawn of Love. And when he had ascended to this height—scant of breath, yet still unsatiated—he could only further glorify her with the title of 'Queen,' with which he nine times hailed her, as with nine parting salutations from the censer of his soul. His canticle died joyfully away in those last ejaculations of triumph: 'Queen of virgins, Queen of all saints. Queen conceived without sin!' She, ever before him, shone in splendour; and he, on the topmost step, only reached by Mary's intimates, remained there yet another moment, swooning amidst the subtle atmosphere around him; still too far away to kiss the edge of her azure robe, already feeling that he was about to fall, but ever possessed by a desire to ascend again and again, and seek that superhuman felicity. *"

"Le rayon de soleil montait toujours, le maître-autel flambait, le prêtre se persuadait que c’était bien la grâce qui lui revenait, pour qu’il éprouvât une telle jouissance intérieure. Le grondement fauve, derrière lui, se faisait câlin. Il ne sentait plus sur sa nuque que la douceur d’une patte de velours, comme si quelque chat géant l’eût caressé.","The ray of sunshine was still rising, the high altar was on fire, the priest convinced himself that it was indeed the grace that was his, that he felt such inner joy. The tawny growl behind him was cuddling. He no longer felt on his neck anything but the softness of a velvet paw, as if some giant cat had caressed him.","The ray of sunshine climbed still higher, the main altar was aflame, the priest began to believe it was really grace returning to him, since he felt such inner joy. The wild growling behind him became a gentle coaxing.

"Cette fois, elle se rendit à ce coin mélancolique qui était comme le cimetière du parterre. Un automne brûlant y avait mis une seconde poussée des fleurs du printemps. Elle s’acharna surtout sur des plates-bandes de tubéreuses et de jacinthes, à genoux au milieu des herbes, menant sa récolte avec des précautions d’avare. Les tubéreuses semblaient pour elle des fleurs précieuses, qui devaient distiller goutte à goutte de l’or, des richesses, des biens extraordinaires. Les jacinthes, toutes perlées de leurs grains fleuris, étaient comme des colliers dont chaque perle allait lui verser des joies ignorées aux hommes. Et, bien qu’elle disparût dans la brassée de jacinthes et de tubéreuses qu’elle avait coupée, elle ravagea plus loin un champ de pavots, elle trouva moyen de raser encore un champ de soucis. Par-dessus les tubéreuses, par-dessus les jacinthes, les soucis et les pavots s’entassèrent. Elle revint en courant se décharger dans la chambre au plafond bleu, veillant à ce que le vent ne lui volât pas un pistil. Elle redescendit.","This time, she went to this melancholy corner which was like the cemetery on the floor. A scorching autumn had put a second flush of spring flowers there. Above all, she worked hard on beds of tuberoses and hyacinths, on her knees in the middle of the grass, carrying out her harvest with the precautions of a miser. The tuberoses seemed to her precious flowers, which were to distil drop by drop gold, wealth, extraordinary goods. The hyacinths, all beaded with their flowery seeds, were like necklaces, each bead of which would bring him joys unknown to men. And, although she disappeared in the armful of hyacinths and tuberoses she had cut, she ravaged a field of poppies farther on, she found a way to raze yet another field of marigolds. Above the tuberoses, above the hyacinths, marigolds and poppies were heaped. She ran back to unload herself in the room with the blue ceiling, making sure the wind didn't steal a pistil from her. She came back down.","This time she went to the gloomy corner which was rather like the graveyard of the flower garden. An especially warm autumn had created there a second growth of spring flowers. She fell most eagerly upon beds of tuberoses and hyacinths, kneeling in the grass, and harvesting them with the meticulous care of a miser. The tuberoses seemed to her to be precious flowers, which would, drop by drop, distil gold and riches, amazing wealth. The hyacinths, all pearly with their flowering seeds, were like necklaces whose every pearl would offer her joys unknown to mankind. And although she was disappearing under the armful of hyacinths and tuberoses she had cut, she still went on to ravage a field of poppies, and even managed to raze to the ground a field of marigolds. On top of the tuberoses, on top of the hyacinths, were heaped marigolds and poppies. She ran back to unload herself in the room with the blue ceiling, making sure the wind did not rob her of a single pistil. Then she went back down.","This time she repaired to that gloomy corner which seemed like the graveyard of the flower-garden. A warm autumn had there brought on a second crop of spring flowers. She raided the borders of tuberoses and hyacinths; going down upon her knees, and gathering her harvest with all a miser's care, lest she should miss a single blossom. The tuberoses seemed to her to be extremely precious flowers, which would distil drops of gold and wealth and wondrous sweetness. The hyacinths, beaded with pearly blooms, were like necklets, whose every pearl would pour forth joys unknown to man. And although she almost buried herself beneath the mass of tuberoses and hyacinths which she plucked, she next stripped a field of poppies, and even found means to crop an expanse of marigolds farther on. All these she heaped over the tuberoses and hyacinths, and then ran back to the room with the blue ceiling, taking the greatest care as she went that the breeze should not rob her of a single pistil. And once more did she come downstairs."
"— Oh ! Je n’ai pas peur, dit-il. Les morts, ça ne bouge plus.","- Oh ! I'm not afraid, he said. The dead don't move.","‘Oh! I’m not afraid,’ he said. ‘They don’t move about when they’re dead.’","'Oh, I'm not afraid,' he said. ' Dead folk don't stir.'"
"— Tout à l’heure, répondit la vieille servante. Ma soupe chauffe.","""Presently,"" replied the old servant. My soup is heating up.","‘In a while,’ replied the old servant. ‘My soup is warming.’","'I shall, presently,' the old servant answered. ' My soup is warming.'"
"— Je t’aime, Albine.","""I love you, Albina.","‘I love you, Albine.’","'I love you, Albine,' said Serge."
L’abbé Mouret s’était recueilli. Il commença à voix presque basse :,Father Mouret had meditated. He began in an almost low voice:,Abbé Mouret had collected himself. He began in a rather low voice:,"Meantime Abbe Mouret had collected himself, and he began, in a rather low voice:"
"Elle accentua ce mot avec un si étrange mépris, que l’abbé Mouret tressaillit, comme si la laideur du Frère l’eût frappé pour la première fois. Celui-ci s’était contenté de grogner. Il avait une haine sourde contre Désirée, dont la belle poussée animale l’offensait.","She accentuated this word with such strange contempt that Abbé Mouret started, as if the Brother's ugliness had struck him for the first time. He just groaned. He had a secret hatred for Désirée, whose beautiful animal thrust offended him.","She emphasized this word with such strange contempt that Abbé Mouret shuddered, as if the ugliness of Brother Archangias had just struck him for the first time. The Brother merely growled. He had an unspoken hatred of Désirée, whose beautiful animal growth was offensive to him.","With such singular contempt did she emphasise that last word that Abbe Mouret started as if the Brother's ugliness had just struck him for the first time. The latter contented himself with growling. He had always felt a covert hatred for Desiree, whose lusty physical development offended him."
"— Père, cria-t-elle, voici monsieur le curé qui vous demande.","'Father,' she cried, 'here is Monsieur le cure asking for you.","‘Father,’ she called out, ‘here’s Monsieur le Curé come to look for you.’","'Father,' she called out, 'here's Monsieur le Cure asking for you.'"
"— Que dis-tu ? Que rêves-tu là, tout haut ?… Ne suis-je pas ta femme ? N’es-tu pas venu pour être mon mari ?","- What are you saying ? What are you dreaming there, aloud?... Am I not your wife? Didn't you come to be my husband?",‘What are you saying? Are you just dreaming aloud?... Am I not your wife? Didn’t you come here to be my husband?’,'What are you saying? What is it you are dreaming aloud? Am I not your wife? Haven't you come here to be my husband?'
"Il lui jeta une volée de petites pierres en façon de mitraille. Jeanbernat, atteint à l’épaule, lâcha les cailloux qu’il tenait et s’avança tranquillement, pendant que Frère Archangias prenait dans le tas deux nouvelles poignées, en bégayant :","He threw a volley of small stones at her like grapeshot. Jeanbernat, hit in the shoulder, let go of the pebbles he was holding and advanced quietly, while Brother Archangias took two new handfuls from the heap, stammering:","He threw a volley of little stones like grapeshot. Jeanbernat, hit on the shoulder, dropped the pebbles he was holding and calmly moved forward, while Brother Archangias was picking up two more handfuls from the heap, muttering:","Then he threw a handful of small pebbles like a volley of grape-shot. Jeanbernat, who was struck upon the shoulder, dropped the stones he was holding, and quietly stepped forwards, while Brother Archangias picked two fresh handfuls from the heap, blurting out:"
"— C’est un mensonge, ce n’est pas défendu, murmura-t-elle. Tu es un homme, tu ne dois pas avoir peur… Si nous allions là, et que quelque danger me menaçât, tu me défendrais, n’est-ce pas ? Tu saurais bien m’emporter à ton cou ? Moi, je suis tranquille, quand je suis avec toi… Vois donc comme tu as des bras forts.

Do we fear anything, when we have arms as strong as yours!","‘It’s a lie, it’s not forbidden,’ she murmured. ‘You’re a man, you shouldn’t be afraid...

If we went there, and any danger threatened me, you would protect me, you would defend me, would you not? You could carry me off on your back, couldn't you? I am never the least afraid when I have you with me. Look how strong your arms have grown. What is there for any one with such strong arms as yours to be afraid of?'"
"Mais, le lendemain, il fut pris d’une peur d’enfant. Jamais il ne consentit à ce que les fenêtres fussent grandes ouvertes. Il murmurait : « Tout à l’heure, plus tard. » Il demeurait anxieux, il avait l’inquiétude du premier coup de lumière qu’il recevrait dans les yeux. Le soir arriva, qu’il n’avait pu prendre la décision de revoir le soleil en face. Il était resté le visage tourné vers les rideaux, suivant sur la transparence du linge le matin pâle, l’ardent midi, le crépuscule violâtre, toutes les couleurs, toutes les émotions du ciel. Là, se peignait jusqu’au frisson que le battement d’ailes d’un oiseau donne à l’air tiède, jusqu’à la joie des odeurs, palpitant dans un rayon. Derrière ce voile, derrière ce rêve attendri de la vie puissante du dehors, il écoutait monter le printemps. Et même il étouffait un peu, par moments, lorsque l’afflux du sang nouveau de la terre, malgré l’obstacle des rideaux, arrivait à lui trop rudement.","But the next day he was seized with the fear of a child. He never allowed the windows to be wide open. He whispered, “Soon, later. He remained anxious, he was worried about the first flash of light he would receive in his eyes. The evening arrived, that he had not been able to make the decision to see the sun again in front. He had remained with his face turned towards the curtains, following on the transparency of the linen the pale morning, the ardent noon, the violet twilight, all the colors, all the emotions of the sky. There, even the thrill that the flapping of a bird's wings gives to the warm air, even the joy of smells, quivering in a ray. Behind this veil, behind this tender dream of the powerful life outside, he listened to spring rising. And he even suffocated a little, at times, when the influx of new blood from the earth, despite the obstacle of the curtains, came to him too harshly.","But the next day he was seized by a childish fear. He would not allow the windows to be opened wide. ‘ In a while, later on,’ he would murmur. He remained anxious, worried about the effect of the first impact of light on his eyes. Evening came, and he still had not been able to make the decision to face the sun again. He had stayed with his face turned towards the curtains, following, on the transparence of the cloth, the pale morning light, the blaze of noon, the mauve of twilight, all the colours, all the emotions of the heavens. Upon that screen were reflected even the quivering of the warm air when a bird flaps its wings, and the joyfulness of the scents throbbing within a sunbeam. Behind that veil, that softened dream of the powerful life outside, he could hear spring arriving. And at times he was even suffocated, when in spite of the barrier of the curtains the rush of the earth’s new blood came at him too brutally.","But on the morrow he was seized with childish fear. He would not hear of the windows being opened wide. ' By-and-by,' he muttered, 'later on.' He was fearful, he dreaded the first beam of light that would flash upon his eyes. Evening came on, and still he had been unable to make up his mind to look upon the sun. He remained thus all day long, his face turned towards the curtains, watching on their transparent tissue the pallor of morn, the glow of noon, the violet tint of twilight, all the hues, all the emotions of the sky. There were pictured even the quiverings of the warm air at the light stroke of a bird's wing, even the delight of earth's odours throbbing in a sunbeam. Behind that veil, behind that softened phantasm of the mighty life without, he could hear the rise of spring. He even felt stifled at times when in spite of the curtains' barrier the rush of the earth's new blood came upon him too strongly."

"Le cabriolet s’était arrêté, un homme se penchait.

Et elle s’en alla. La porte de la sacristie retomba avec un soupir étouffé.,And she left. The sacristy door fell with a stifled sigh.,And she went away. The door of the sacristy closed with a muffled sigh.,And then she disappeared. The vestry door fell back with a sound like a deep sigh.
"D’autre fois, lorsqu’elle le croyait endormi, Albine disparaissait pendant des heures. Et, lorsqu’elle rentrait, elle le trouvait les yeux luisants de curiosité, dévoré d’impatience. Il lui criait :","Other times, when she thought he was asleep, Albine disappeared for hours. And, when she returned, she found him, his eyes shining with curiosity, devoured with impatience.

And on coming in again, she would find him burning with impatience, his eyes gleaming with curiosity."
"Ils baissaient la voix par un sentiment religieux. Ils n’eurent pas même la curiosité de regarder en l’air, pour voir l’arbre. Ils en sentaient trop la majesté sur leurs épaules. Albine, d’un regard, demandait si elle avait exagéré l’enchantement des verdures. Serge répondait par deux larmes claires, qui coulaient sur ses joues. Leur joie d’être enfin là restait indicible.","They lowered their voices with a religious feeling. They didn't even have the curiosity to look up to see the tree. They felt its majesty too much on their shoulders. Albine, with a look, asked if she had exaggerated the enchantment of the greenery. Serge replied with two clear tears, which ran down his cheeks. Their joy at finally being there was unspeakable.","They lowered their voices with a feeling of religious awe. They did not even have the curiosity to look up in the air to see the tree.

Serge answered with two bright tears that rolled down his cheeks. Their joy at being there at last was simply indescribable.","It was a kind of religious feeling which made them lower their voices. No sentiment of curiosity impelled them to raise their heads and scan the tree. The consciousness of its majesty weighed heavily upon them.

The joy that filled them at being there could not be expressed in words."
"La Teuse se leva aussi, lui barrant le passage de sa masse énorme. Elle se fâchait, elle criait :","La Teuse got up too, barring his way with his enormous mass.

— Tu es souffrante ?,"""Are you ill?""",‘Are you not well?’,"Then, after a long interval of silence, Serge would say to Albine in a tone full of anxiety: 'You are ill?'"
"Et la branche cassa, en effet ; mais lentement, avec une si longue déchirure, qu’elle s’abattit peu à peu, comme pour déposer Albine à terre d’une façon très douce.

"Il avait arrêté l’abbé Mouret au milieu de la route, en le regardant avec des yeux luisant d’une terrible jalousie. Les délices entrevues du Paradou le torturaient. Depuis des semaines, il était resté sur le seuil, flairant de loin les jouissances damnables. Mais l’abbé restant muet, il se remit à marcher, ricanant, grognant des paroles équivoques. Et, haussant le ton :","He had stopped Abbé Mouret in the middle of the road, looking at him with eyes shining with terrible jealousy. The delights glimpsed at Paradou tortured him. For weeks he had remained on the threshold, sniffing out damnable pleasures from afar. But the abbé remaining silent, he resumed walking, sneering, growling ambiguous words. And, raising his voice:","He had stopped Abbé Mouret in the middle of the road, looking at him with his eyes gleaming with a terrible jealousy. The half-glimpsed delights of the Paradou tormented him. He had been there for weeks, on the threshold, scenting damnable delights far off.

Then, more loudly:","He made Abbe Mouret stop in the middle of the road, and glared at him with a terrible expression of jealousy. The thought of the priest's life in the Paradou tortured him. But the Abbe kept perfect silence, so Archangias set off again, jeering as he went. Then, in a louder voice, he said:"
"— Voici le Paradou, répondit le docteur, en montrant la muraille. Tu n’es donc point encore venu par ici ? Nous ne sommes pas à une lieue des Artaud… Une propriété qui a dû être superbe, ce Paradou. La muraille du parc, de ce côté, a bien deux kilomètres. Mais, depuis plus de cent ans, tout y pousse à l’aventure.","""Here is the Paradou,"" replied the doctor, pointing to the wall. So you haven't been here yet? We are not a league away from Artaud… A property that must have been superb, this Paradou. The wall of the park, on this side, is a good two kilometers long. But, for more than a hundred years, everything there has led to adventure.","‘This is the Paradou,’ the doctor replied, pointing at the wall. ‘ Have you never come this way before? We’re less than three miles from Les Artaud... A property that must have been splendid once, this Paradou. The wall of the park, on this side, is easily two kilometres long. But for more than a hundred years it’s been left to run wild.’","'This is the Paradou,' replied the doctor, pointing to the wall. ' Haven't you been this way before, then? We are not three miles from Les Artaud. A splendid property it must have been, this Paradou. The park wall this side alone is quite a mile and a half long. But for over a hundred years it's all been running wild.'"
"— Non, non, je ne veux pas. Si tu venais à glisser, nous ferions un fameux plongeon tous les deux… Tu ne sais pas comme ces pierres-là sont traîtres.","""No, no, I don't want to. If you were to slip, we would both make a famous dive… You don't know how treacherous those stones are.","‘No, no. I don’t want to. If you were to slip, we’d both have no end of a ducking... You don’t know how treacherous those stones can be.’","'No, no; I'd rather not. If you were to slip, we should both of us get a famous wetting. You don't know how treacherous those stones are.'"
"Alors, courant sur une jambe, avec des déhanchements et des secousses à enfoncer les dalles, elle alla à la sacristie chercher le Missel, qu’elle plaça sur le pupitre, du côté de l’Épire, sans l’ouvrir, la tranche tournée vers le milieu de l’autel. Et elle alluma les deux cierges. En emportant son balai, elle jeta un coup d’œil autour d’elle, pour s’assurer que le ménage du bon Dieu était bien fait. L’église dormait ; la corde seule, près du confessionnal, se balançait encore, de la voûte au pavé, d’un mouvement long et flexible.","Then, running on one leg, swaying and shaking the slabs, she went to the sacristy to fetch the Missal, which she placed on the desk, on the side of Epirus, without opening it, the edge turned towards the middle of the altar. And she lit the two candles. Carrying her broom, she cast a glance around her, to make sure that the cleaning of the good Lord was well done. The church was sleeping; the rope alone, near the confessional, still swayed, from the vault to the pavement, with a long and flexible movement.","Then, pegging along on one leg, and jolting enough to batter the flagstones into the ground, she went to the sacristy to find the Missal, which she placed without opening it on the lectern, on the side of the Epistle, with its edge turned towards the middle of the altar. And she lit the two candles. As she carried her broom away, she had a look round to make sure the good Lord’s housekeeping was properly done. The church seemed asleep; only the bell rope, near the confessional, was still swinging from the vault down to the floor with a long, lithe motion.","Then hopping on one leg, swaying and stumping heavily enough to drive in the flagstones, she hastened to the sacristy for the Missal, which she placed unopened on the lectern on the Epistle side, with its edges turned towards the middle of the altar. And afterwards she lighted the two candles. As she went off with her broom, she gave a glance round her to make sure that the abode of the Divinity had been put in proper order. All was still, save that the bell-rope near the confessional still swung between roof and floor with a sinuous sweep."
"Puis, ce fut Serge qui recoiffa Albine. Il prit ses cheveux à poignée, avec une maladresse charmante, et planta le peigne de travers, dans l’énorme chignon tassé sur la tête. Or, il arriva qu’elle était adorablement coiffée. Il se leva ensuite, lui tendit les mains, la soutint à la taille pour qu’elle se mit debout. Tous deux souriaient toujours, sans parler. Doucement, ils s’en allèrent par le sentier.","Then it was Serge who restyled Albine. He took his handful of hair, with a charming awkwardness, and planted the comb askew in the enormous chignon packed on his head. Now, it happened that she had her hair done adorably. He then got up, held out his hands to her, supported her at the waist so that she stood up. Both were still smiling, without speaking. Slowly they went down the path.","Then it was Serge who set about rearranging Albine’s hair. He took handfuls of hair with a charming clumsiness, and planted the comb askew into the huge chignon piled up on her head. As it turned out, this hairstyle suited her wonderfully well. He then stood up, held out his hands, and gripped her by the waist to raise her to her feet. Both were still smiling, and neither spoke. Quietly they went away down the path.","At last Serge put up Albine's hair. He raised it in handfuls with delightful awkwardness, and stuck her comb askew in the enormous knot that he had heaped upon her head. And as it happened she looked bewitching thus. Then, rising from the ground, he held out his hands to her, and supported her waist as she got up. They still smiled without speaking a word, and slowly they went down the path."
"— Tu me chatouilles, grande bête. Finis donc !","“You tickle me, big beast. So finish!","‘You’re tickling me, you stupid creature. Stop it!’","With her arms whirling, she kept on repeating: 'You tickle me, you big stupid. Leave off!'"
"N’était-ce pas un de ces chênes gigantesques ? Ou bien un de ces beaux platanes, un de ces bouleaux blancs comme des femmes, un de ces ormes dont les muscles craquaient ? Albine et Serge s’enfonçaient toujours, ne sachant plus, noyés au milieu de cette foule. Un instant, ils crurent avoir trouvé : ils étaient au milieu d’un carré de noyers, dans une ombre si froide, qu’ils en grelottaient. Plus loin, ils eurent une autre émotion, en entrant sous un petit bois de châtaigniers, tout vert de mousse, avec des élargissements de branches bizarres, assez vastes pour y bâtir des villages suspendus. Plus loin encore, Albine découvrit une clairière, où ils coururent tous deux, haletants. Au centre d’un tapis d’herbe fine, un caroubier mettait comme un écroulement de verdure, une Babel de feuillages, dont les ruines se couvraient d’une végétation extraordinaire. Des pierres restaient prises dans le bois, arrachées du sol par le flot montant de la sève. Les branches hautes se recourbaient, allaient se planter au loin, entouraient le tronc d’arches profondes, d’une population de nouveaux troncs, sans cesse multipliés. Et sur l’écorce, toute crevée de déchirures saignantes, des gousses mûrissaient. Le fruit même du monstre était un effort qui lui trouait la peau. Ils firent lentement le tour, entrèrent sous les branches étalées où se croisaient les rues d’une ville, fouillèrent du regard les fentes béantes des racines dénudées. Puis, ils s’en allèrent, n’ayant pas senti là le bonheur surhumain qu’ils cherchaient.","Wasn't it one of those gigantic oaks? Or one of those beautiful plane trees, one of those birches white as women, one of those elms whose muscles were cracking? Albine and Serge were still sinking, not knowing any more, drowned in the middle of this crowd. For a moment they thought they had found it: they were in the middle of a square of walnut trees, in a shadow so cold that they were shivering. Further on, they had another emotion, entering under a small wood of chestnut trees, all green with moss, with bizarre widenings of branches, large enough to build hanging villages there. Farther still, Albine discovered a clearing, where they both ran, panting. In the center of a carpet of fine grass, a carob tree placed a sort of crumbling greenery, a Babel of foliage, the ruins of which were covered with extraordinary vegetation. Stones remained stuck in the wood, torn from the ground by the rising tide of sap. The high branches bent over, planted themselves in the distance, surrounded the trunk with deep arches, with a population of new trunks, constantly multiplying. And on the bark, all punctured with bleeding tears, pods were ripening. The very fruit of the monster was an effort that pierced his skin. They walked slowly around, entered under the spreading branches where the streets of a city crossed, peered into the gaping crevices of the bare roots. Then they went away, not having felt the superhuman happiness they were looking for.","Wasn’t it one of these gigantic oaks? Or was it one of these beautiful plane trees, one of these girlish white birches, or one of these elms, with their creaking muscles? Albine and Serge plunged onwards, not knowing at all any more, just lost in this throng. For a moment they thought they had found it; they were in the middle of a patch of walnut trees, in a shade so cool it made them shiver. Further on, they had another moment of excitement on entering a little wood of chestnut trees green with moss, with an expanse of strange, very long branches, vast enough for whole villages to be built on top. Further still, Albine discovered a glade to which they both rushed, panting with eagerness. At the centre of a carpet of fine grass, a carob tree created what seemed an avalanche of greenery, a Babel* of foliage, whose ruins were covered with extraordinary plants of all sorts. Stones, torn out of the soil by the upward thrust of the sap, lay trapped in the wood of the trunk. The lofty branches were bending over to root themselves elsewhere, surrounding the trunk with deep arches and a new population of young, endlessly multiplying trees. And on the torn and bleeding bark, carob-pods were ripening. Even the fruiting of this monster was an effort that ruptured its skin. Slowly they walked around it, then went in under the branches spread in all directions like the streets of a city, and explored with their eyes the gaping cracks in the bare roots. Then they went on, not having found in that place the superhuman happiness they sought.","Could the tree which Serge and Albine sought be one of those colossal oaks? or was it one of those lovely planes, or one of those pale, maidenly birches, or one of those creaking elms? Albine and Serge still plodded on, unable to tell, completely lost amongst the crowding trees. For a moment they thought they had found the object of their quest in the midst of a group of walnut trees from whose thick foliage fell so cold a shadow that they shivered beneath it. Further on they felt another thrill of emotion as they came upon a little wood of chestnut trees, green with moss and thrusting out big strange-shaped branches, on which one might have built an aerial village. But further still Albine caught sight of a clearing, whither they both ran hastily. Here, in the midst of a carpet of fine turf, a locust tree had set a very toppling of greenery, a foliaged Babel, whose ruins were covered with the strangest vegetation. Stones, sucked up from the ground by the mounting sap, still remained adhering to the trunk. High branches bent down to earth again, and, taking root, surrounded the parent tree with lofty arches, a nation of new trunks which ever increased and multiplied. Upon the bark, seared with bleeding wounds, were ripening fruit-pods; the mere effort of bearing fruit strained the old monster's skin until it split. The young folks walked slowly round it, passing under the arched branches which formed as it were the streets of a city, and stared at the gaping cracks of the naked roots. Then they went off, for they had not felt there the supernatural happiness they sought."
"Puis, se tournant vers son frère, d’un air ravi :","Then, turning to his brother, with a delighted air:","Then turning to her brother and looking quite excited, she said:","Then, turning towards her brother, she went on with an air of rapture:"
— Jeanbernat est un chien. Il doit crever comme un chien.,— Jeanbernat is a dog. He must die like a dog.,‘Jeanbernat is a dog. He should die like a dog.’,"Brother Archangias, his mouth full, struck the table violently with his knife, and roared: 'Jeanbernat is a dog; he ought to die like a dog.'"
"— Parle-moi, implora Albine. Tu ne m’as jamais parlé ainsi. En haut, dans la chambre, quand tu n’étais pas encore muet, tu causais avec un babillage d’enfant… D’où vient donc que je ne reconnais plus ta voix ? Tout à l’heure, j’ai cru que ta voix descendait des arbres, qu’elle m’arrivait du jardin entier, qu’elle était un de ces soupirs profonds qui me troublaient la nuit, avant ta venue… Écoute, tout se tait pour t’entendre parler encore.","""Talk to me,"" implored Albine. You never spoke to me like that. Upstairs, in the bedroom, when you weren't yet mute, you were chatting with the babbling of a child. How does it come about that I no longer recognize your voice? Just now, I thought your voice came down from the trees, that it came to me from the whole garden, that it was one of those deep sighs that disturbed me at night, before you came... Listen, everything is was silent to hear you speak again.","‘Speak to me,’ Albine implored him. ‘You haven’t ever spoken to me like that. Up there, in the room, before you became dumb, you used to prattle like a child... How is it then that I don’t recognize your voice now? A short while ago, I thought your voice was coming down from the trees, that it was coming to me from the whole garden, that it was one of those deep sighs that disturbed me during the night, before you came here... Listen, everything is keeping quiet just to hear you speak again.’","'Speak to me,' implored Albine. ' You have never spoken to me like that. When you were upstairs in your room, when you were not dumb, you talked the silly prattle of a child. How is it I no longer know your voice? Just now I thought it had come down from the trees, that it reached me from every part of the garden, that it was one of those deep sighs that used to worry me at night before you came. Listen, everything is keeping silence to hear you speak again.'"
"— Oh ! tu verras, je me ferai toute petite. Tu ne sauras même pas que je suis là.

You won't even know I'm here.

"— Adieu, balbutia-t-il, je m’en vais… Alors, tu refuses de venir ? Voyons, fais-le pour moi ; tu vois combien je souffre. Je te jure qu’elle partira ensuite. C’est convenu… J’ai mon cabriolet. Dans une heure, tu seras de retour… Viens, je t’en prie.","""Farewell,"" he stammered, ""I'm leaving. So you refuse to come?"" Come on, do it for me; you see how much I suffer. I swear to you that she will leave then. It’s agreed… I have my convertible. In an hour you'll be back... Come, please.","‘Goodbye,’ he stammered, ‘I’m going now... So you refuse to come? Look, do it for me; you can see how painful this is for me. I swear she will go away afterwards. That’s agreed... My gig is here. You’ll be back in an hour. Come, I beg you.’","'Good-bye!' he stammered; 'I am going. So you won't come? Do, now—for my sake! You see how miserable, how upset I am. I swear to you that she shall go away immediately afterwards.

"— Je le sais bien, répondit-elle. Je l’ai vue avec mademoiselle entrer dans la basse-cour.","""I know it well,"" she answered. I saw her with Mademoiselle enter the barnyard.","‘I know,’ she replied. ‘I saw her going into the farmyard with Mademoiselle Désirée.’","'I know that well enough,' answered La Teuse.

"Confession de l’être entier, entretien libre, sans l’embarras de la langue, effusion naturelle du cœur, s’envolant avant la pensée elle-même. L’abbé Mouret disait tout à Jésus, comme à un Dieu venu dans l’intimité de sa tendresse, et qui peut tout entendre. Il avouait qu’il aimait toujours Albine ; il s’étonnait d’avoir pu la maltraiter, la chasser, sans que ses entrailles se fussent révoltées ; cela l’émerveillait, il souriait d’une façon sereine, comme mis en présence d’un acte miraculeusement fort, accompli par un autre. Et Jésus répondait que cela ne devait pas l’étonner, que les plus grands saints étaient souvent des armes inconscientes aux mains de Dieu. Alors, l’abbé exprimait un doute : n’avait-il pas eu moins de mérite à se réfugier au pied de l’autel et jusque dans la Passion de son Seigneur ? N’était-il pas encore d’un faible courage, puisqu’il n’osait combattre seul ? Mais Jésus se montrait tolérant ; il expliquait que la faiblesse de l’homme est la continuelle occupation de Dieu, il disait préférer les âmes souffrantes, dans lesquelles il venait s’asseoir comme un ami au chevet d’un ami. Était-ce une damnation d’aimer Albine ? Non, si cet amour allait au-delà de la chair, s’il ajoutait une espérance au désir de l’autre vie. Puis, comment fallait-il l’aimer ? Sans une parole, sans un pas vers elle, en laissant cette tendresse toute pure s’exhaler ainsi qu’une bonne odeur, agréable au ciel. Là, Jésus avait un léger rire de bienveillance, se rapprochant, encourageant les aveux, si bien que le prêtre peu à peu s’enhardissait à lui détailler la beauté d’Albine. Elle avait les cheveux blonds des anges. Elle était toute blanche avec de grands yeux doux, pareille aux saintes qui ont des auréoles. Jésus se taisait, mais riait toujours. Et qu’elle avait grandi ! Elle ressemblait à une reine, maintenant, avec sa taille ronde, ses épaules superbes. Oh ! la prendre à la taille, ne fût-ce qu’une seconde, et sentir ses épaules se renverser sous cette étreinte ! Le rire de Jésus pâlissait, mourait comme un rayon d’astre au bord de l’horizon. L’abbé Mouret parlait seul, à présent. Vraiment, il s’était montré trop dur. Pourquoi avoir chassé Albine, sans un mot de tendresse, puisque le ciel permettait d’aimer ?","Confession of the whole being, free conversation, without the embarrassment of language, natural outpouring of the heart, flying before thought itself. Father Mouret said everything to Jesus, as to a God who came in the intimacy of his tenderness and who can hear everything. He confessed that he still loved Albine; he was astonished at having been able to mistreat her, drive her away, without his entrails revolting; he was amazed by this, he smiled serenely, as if confronted with a miraculously strong act, accomplished by another. And Jesus replied that it should not surprise him, that the greatest saints were often unconscious weapons in the hands of God. Then, the abbot expressed a doubt: had he not had less merit in taking refuge at the foot of the altar and even in the Passion of his Lord? Was he not still of weak courage, since he dared not fight alone? But Jesus was tolerant; he explained that the weakness of man is the continual occupation of God, he said he preferred suffering souls, in whom he came to sit like a friend at a friend's bedside. Was it a damnation to love Albine? No, if this love went beyond the flesh, if it added hope to the desire for the other life. Then, how was it to love him? Without a word, without a step towards her, letting this pure tenderness exhale like a good smell, pleasant to the sky. There, Jesus had a slight laugh of benevolence, drawing closer, encouraging the confessions, so that the priest gradually grew bolder in detailing Albine's beauty to him. She had the blond hair of angels. She was all white with large soft eyes, like the saints who have halos. Jesus was silent, but still laughing. And she had grown up! She looked like a queen now, with her round waist, her superb shoulders. Oh ! take her by the waist, if only for a second, and feel her shoulders slump under this embrace! Jesus' laughter faded, died away like a ray of a star on the edge of the horizon. Abbe Mouret was speaking alone now. Really, he had been too harsh. Why did you drive Albine away, without a word of tenderness, since heaven permitted love?","This was a confession of his whole being, a free exchange without the cumbersome intervention of the tongue, a natural effusion of the heart, flying out even before thought itself. Abbé Mouret told Jesus everything, as to a God who had entered into the intimacy of his feelings, and could be told everything. He confessed that he still loved Albine; he was amazed that he had been able to ill-treat her and drive her away without a complete revolt of his very entrails; it astonished him; and he smiled serenely, as if looking upon some act of miraculous fortitude accomplished by another. And Jesus replied that it should not astonish him, for the greatest saints were often unknowingly instruments in the hands of God. Then the abbé expressed a doubt: had he not been less worthy, having taken refuge at the foot of the altar and even in the Passion of his Lord? Was he not, after all, of but feeble courage, since he did not dare to fight alone? But Jesus was tolerant; he explained that the weakness of mankind is the constant concern of God, he especially loved suffering souls, whom he would visit, and sit with, like one going to the bedside of a sick friend. Was it a damnation to love Albine? No, if that love went beyond the flesh, and if it added a hope to the desire for another life. But how should he love her? Without saying a word, without taking one step towards her, but letting that pure affection rise up like a sweet scent pleasing to Heaven? Then Jesus gave a little laugh, full of kindness, drawing nearer and encouraging his confessions, so the priest gradually grew bold enough to describe in detail the beauty of Albine. She had the fair hair of the angels. She was all white, with large, gentle eyes, like the haloed saints. Jesus was silent, but still laughing. And how tall she had grown! She was like a queen now, with her rounded figure and her splendid shoulders. Oh! to hold her round her waist, if only for a second, and feel those shoulders falling back beneath his embrace! The laughter of Jesus grew faint and died away, like the light of a star disappearing on the horizon. Abbé Mouret was talking to himself now. Really, he had been too hard on her. Why did he drive Albine away without a single tender word, when love was permitted by Heaven?","On his side there was unreserved confession, unimpeded by the restraints of language, natural effusion of the heart which spoke even more quickly than the mind. Abbe Mouret told everything to Jesus, as to a God who had come down in all the intimacy of the most loving tenderness, and who would listen to everything. He confessed that he still loved Albine; and he was surprised that he had been able to speak sternly to her and drive her away, without his whole being breaking out into revolt. He marvelled at it, and smiled as though it were some wonderful miracle performed by another. And Jesus told him that he must not be astonished, and that the greatest saints were often but unconscious instruments in the hands of God. Then the Abbe gave expression to a doubt. Had he not lost merit in seeking refuge in the Cross and even in the Passion of his Saviour? Had he not shown that he possessed as yet but little courage, since he had not dared to fight unaided? But Jesus evinced kindly tolerance, and answered that man's weakness was God's continual care, and that He especially loved those suffering souls, to whose assistance He went, like a friend to the bedside of a sick companion. But was it a sin to love Albine, a sin for which he, Serge, would be damned? No; if his love was clean of all fleshly taint, and added another hope to his desire for eternal life. But, then, how was he to love her? In silence; without speaking a word to her, without taking a step towards her; simply allowing his pure affection to breathe forth, like a sweet perfume, pleasing unto heaven. And Jesus smiled with increasing kindliness, drawing nearer as if to encourage confession, in such wise that the priest grew bolder and began to recapitulate Albine's charms. She had hair that was fair and golden as an angel's; she was very white, with big soft eyes, like those of the aureoled saints. Jesus seemed to listen to this in silence, though a smile still played upon His face. And the priest continued: She had grown much taller. She was now like a queen, with rounded form and splendid shoulders. Oh! to clasp her waist, were it only for a second, and to feel her shoulders drawn close by his embrace! But the smile on the divine countenance then paled and died away, as a star sinks and falls beneath the horizon. Abbe Mouret now spoke all alone. Ah! had he not shown himself too hard-hearted? Why had he driven her away without one single word of affection, since Heaven allowed him to love her?"
"— Hein ! Quel tas ! reprit Désirée, en menant son frère dans la vapeur âcre. J’ai tout mis là, personne ne m’a aidée… Va, ce n’est pas sale. Ça nettoie. Regarde mes bras.","- Eh ! What a pile! resumed Désirée, leading her brother into the acrid vapor. I put everything there, no one helped me… Come on, it's not dirty. It cleans. Look at my arms.","‘Ah! what a big pile!’ Désirée went on, leading her brother into its acrid fumes. ‘I got all of it there by myself, nobody helped me... Go on, it isn’t dirty. It cleans. Look at my arms.’","'What a pile, eh?' continued Desiree, leading her brother into the pungent vapour , 'I put it all there myself, nobody helped me. Go on, it isn't dirty. It cleans. Look at my arms.'"

"Et elle lui tendait les mains, comme pour l’aider à se relever. Lui, se signa de nouveau. Il priait toujours, en la regardant. Il avait calmé le premier frisson de sa chair. Dans la grâce qui l’inondait depuis le matin, ainsi qu’un bain céleste, il puisait des forces surhumaines.","And she held out her hands to him, as if to help him up. He crossed himself again. He was still praying, looking at her. He had calmed the first shudder of his flesh. In the grace that flooded him since morning, like a celestial bath, he drew superhuman strength.","She held out her hands, as if to help him get up. He crossed himself again. He went on praying as he looked at her. He had calmed that first tremor of his flesh. In the grace which had flooded into him since that morning, like some celestial bath, he found superhuman strength.","She stretched out her hands, as though to help him to rise. But he only crossed himself, afresh. He still continued his prayers as he looked at her. He had succeeded in calming the first quiver of his flesh. From the Divine grace which had been streaming around him since the early morning, like a celestial bath, he derived a superhuman strength."
"— Amen, répondit Vincent.","“Amen,” Vincent answered.","‘Amen,’ Vincent responded.","'Amen,' answered Vincent."
"— Elle est très bonne, ta main, reprit-il. Tu ne peux pas t’imaginer comme elle me fait du bien… Elle a l’air d’entrer au fond de moi, pour m’enlever les douleurs que j’ai dans les membres. C’est une caresse partout, un soulagement, une guérison.","""Your hand is very good,"" he went on. You can't imagine how good she does me... She seems to go deep inside me, to take away the pain I have in my limbs. It is a caress everywhere, a relief, a cure.","‘It’s so very kind, this hand of yours,’ he went on. ‘You can’t imagine how much good it’s doing me... it seems to enter right into me, to take away the aches I have in my limbs. It caresses me all over, it’s comforting, healing.’","'Your hand is so nice,' he said once more. ' You can't fancy what good it does me. It seems to steal inside me, and take away all the pain in my limbs. It's as if I were being soothed all over, relieved, cured.'"
"— Vous n’allez pas coucher là, mademoiselle, dit-elle. Laissez donc ces vilaines bêtes.","""You're not going to sleep there, mademoiselle,"" she said. Leave these ugly beasts alone.","‘You’re not going to bed here, Mademoiselle,’ she said. ‘It’s time to leave these nasty creatures.’","You are not going to bed here, I suppose, mademoiselle,' she said. ' Do leave those nasty things.'"
"Celle-là était joueuse comme eux ; elle se ralentissait à certains coudes, partait de là en rires perlés, au milieu de grosses pierres, se calmait à l’abri d’un bouquet d’arbustes, essoufflée, vibrante encore ; elle montrait toutes les humeurs du monde, ayant tour à tour pour lit des sables fins, des plaques de rochers, des graviers limpides, des terres grasses, que les sauts des grenouilles soulevaient en petites fumées jaunes. Albine et Serge y pataugèrent adorablement. Les pieds nus, ils remontèrent la rivière pour rentrer, préférant le chemin de l’eau au chemin des herbes, s’attardant à chaque île qui leur barrait le passage. Ils y débarquaient, ils y conquéraient des pays sauvages, ils s’y reposaient au milieu de grands joncs, de grands roseaux, qui semblaient bâtir exprès pour eux des huttes de naufragés. Retour charmant, amusé par les rives qui déroulaient leur spectacle, égayé de la belle humeur des eaux vivantes.","This one was playful like them; she slowed down at certain bends, went away from there in pearly laughter, in the middle of large stones, calmed down in the shelter of a clump of shrubs, out of breath, still vibrating; it showed all the moods in the world, having alternately for bed fine sands, slabs of rocks, limpid gravel, muddy earth, which the leaps of frogs lifted up in little yellow smoke. Albine and Serge waded through it adorably. Barefoot, they went up the river to return, preferring the path of the water to the path of the grass, lingering at each island that barred their way. They disembarked there, they conquered savage lands there, they rested there in the midst of great rushes, great reeds, which seemed to build shipwrecked huts for them. Charming return, amused by the banks which unfolded their spectacle, brightened by the good humor of the living waters.","It was as playful as they were, slowing down for some bends, then setting off with bubbly laughter through some really big stones, and calming down, breathless and still aquiver, in the shelter of a clump of shrubbery; it displayed every possible mood, with its bed being by turns fine sand, flat rocks, limpid gravel, and rich soil on which frogs leaped about, sending up little clouds of yellow. Albine and Serge paddled around delightedly. They made their way home, going barefoot through the river, preferring the watery path to the grassy path, and pausing at every island that barred their way. There, they made a landing, conquering barbarous countries, and rested among the tall reeds that seemed placed there expressly to serve as shelters for the shipwrecked. It made a charming return journey, with the entertainment provided by the banks displaying their spectacle and the cheerful good humour of the lively water.","It was sportive like themselves, it flowed more slowly at certain bends, whence it started off again with merry ripples, past piles of big stones, into the shelter of some clump of trees, and grew calmer once more. It exhibited every humour as it sped along over soft sand or rocky boulders, over sparkling pebbles or greasy clay, where leaping frogs made yellow puddles. Albine and Serge dabbled about in delight, and even walked homewards through the stream in preference to remaining on the bank. At every little island that divided the current they landed. They conquered the savage spot or rested beneath the lofty canes and reeds, which seemed to grow there expressly as shelter for shipwrecked adventurers. Thus they made a delightful progress, amused by the changing scenery of the banks, enlivened by the merry humour of the living current."

"— Cette Rosalie ! poursuivit le Frère, elle a juste dix-huit ans. Ça se perd sur les bancs de l’école. Il n’y a pas quatre ans, je l’avais encore. Elle était déjà vicieuse… J’ai maintenant sa sœur Catherine, une gamine de onze ans qui promet d’être plus éhontée que son aînée. On la rencontre dans tous les trous avec ce petit misérable de Vincent… Allez, on a beau leur tirer les oreilles jusqu’au sang, la femme pousse toujours en elles. Elles ont la damnation dans leurs jupes. Des créatures bonnes à jeter au fumier, avec leurs saletés qui empoisonnent ! Ça serait un fameux débarras, si l’on étranglait toutes les filles à leur naissance.","""That Rosalie!"" continued the Brother, she is just eighteen. It gets lost on the school benches. Not four years ago, I still had it. She was already vicious… I now have her sister Catherine, an eleven-year-old girl who promises to be more shameless than her eldest. We meet her in all the holes with this little wretch of Vincent… Come on, we can pull their ears until they bleed, the woman always grows in them. They have damnation in their skirts. Creatures good to throw in the manure, with their poisonous filth! It would be a terrible riddance if all the girls were strangled at birth.","‘That Rosalie!’ the Brother went on, ‘she’s just eighteen. Girls like her go wrong when they’re still at school. Less than four years ago, I had her in school. She had already gone to the bad... now I have her sister Catherine, a girl of eleven, who looks like turning out even more shameless than her elder sister. You can find her all over the place with that wretched little Vincent... You see, it’s no good pulling their ears till they bleed, the woman always comes out in them. They have damnation in their skirts. Creatures fit for throwing on the dungheap, with all their poisonous filth! It would be a good riddance if girls were all strangled at birth.’","'That Rosalie, now,' continued the Brother, 'is just eighteen. Not four years since I still had her under me at school, and she was already a gadabout. I have now got her sister Catherine, a chit of eleven, who seems likely to become even worse than her elder. One comes across her in every corner with that little scamp, Vincent. It's no good, you may pull their ears till they bleed, the woman always crops up in them. They carry perdition about with them and are only fit to be thrown on a muck-heap. What a splendid riddance if all girls were strangled at their birth!'"
"— Chut ! siffla-t-elle, si énergiquement, qu’un coup de vent parut s’être engouffré dans l’église.","- Hush! she hissed, so forcefully that a gust of wind seemed to have rushed into the church.","La Teuse shook her broom at them. ‘Hush,’ she hissed, with such force that it was as if a gust of wind had blown into the church.","Hush!' she hissed out, so energetically that it seemed as if a blast of wind had burst into the church."
"Ils s’étaient, enfin, pris à la taille, sans le savoir, d’un geste rassuré et confiant. Les sources calmaient leur fièvre. Mais, comme ils s’éloignaient, Albine parut céder à un souvenir ; elle ramena Serge, en disant :","They had finally taken each other by the waist, without knowing it, with a reassured and confident gesture. The springs calmed their fever. But as they walked away, Albine seemed to yield to a memory; she brought Serge back, saying:","They had at last, without noticing, put their arms around each other’s waist, with a sure and confident gesture. The springs calmed their fever. But as they moved off, Albine seemed to be caught by a memory, and led Serge back, saying:","By this time, almost unawares, they had slipped their arms round each other's waist. The coolness of the springs had soothed their feverish disquietude. But just as they were going away, Albine seemed to recall something and led Serge back again, saying:"

"— Oh ! les sentiers des prairies !… Tu n’as donc plus de mémoire, Serge ? Tu ne connais plus les chemins d’herbe fine, qui s’en vont à travers les prés, parmi de grandes mares de verdure ?… L’après-midi dont je te parle, nous n’étions sortis que pour une heure. Puis, nous allâmes toujours devant nous, si bien que les étoiles se levaient, lorsque nous marchions encore. Cela était si doux, ce tapis sans fin, souple comme de la soie ! Nos pieds ne rencontraient pas un gravier. On eût dit une mer verte, dont l’eau moussue nous berçait. Et nous savions bien où nous conduisaient ces sentiers si tendres qui ne menaient nulle part. Ils nous conduisaient à notre amour, à la joie de vivre les mains à nos tailles, à la certitude d’une journée de bonheur… Nous rentrâmes sans fatigue. Tu étais plus léger qu’au départ, parce que tu m’avais donné tes caresses et que je n’avais pu te les rendre toutes.","- Oh ! the paths of the meadows!... So you have lost your memory, Serge? You no longer know the paths of fine grass, which go through the meadows, among great pools of greenery?... The afternoon of which I am speaking to you, we were only out for an hour. Then, we always went in front of us, so that the stars rose, when we were still walking. It was so soft, this endless carpet, supple as silk! Our feet did not meet a gravel. It looked like a green sea, whose mossy water rocked us. And we knew very well where these tender paths that led nowhere were leading us. They led us to our love, to the joy of living with our hands at our waists, to the certainty of a day of happiness... We returned home without fatigue. You were lighter than at the start, because you had given me your caresses and I hadn't been able to return them all to you.","‘Oh! the paths of the grasslands!... So you have no more memory, Serge? You no longer know the lanes of fine grass that go across the meadows, surrounded by great lakes of greenery?... On the afternoon I’m telling you about, we had set out just for an hour.

It was like a green sea, whose mossy waters cradled us. And we knew very well where they were taking us, those tender paths that led nowhere. They were taking us to our love, to the joy of living with our arms around each other, to the certainty of a whole day of happiness... We returned home with no tiredness.

Ah! how velvety it was, that endless carpet, soft as finest silk! It was just like a green sea whose gentle waters lapped us round. And well we knew whither those beguiling paths that led nowhere, were taking us! They were taking us to our love, to the joy of living together, to the certainty of happiness.'"
"— Entends-tu, entends-tu ? balbutiait Albine à l’oreille de Serge, qu’elle avait laissé tomber sur l’herbe, au pied de l’arbre.","""Do you hear, do you hear?"" stammered Albine in Serge's ear, whom she had dropped on the grass, at the foot of the tree.",‘Do you hear? Do you hear?’ Albine whispered in the ear of Serge whom she had let fall on to the grass at the foot of the tree.,"'Do you hear? Do you hear?' faltered Albine in Serge's ear, when she had let him slip upon the grass at the foot of the tree."
"— Veux-tu ? Veux-tu ? répéta-t-elle, plus brûlante, déjà soulevée à demi.","- Do you want ? Do you want ? she repeated, more ardent, already half lifted.","‘Will you? will you?’ she repeated, even more ardently, already half rising to her feet.","'Will you come? will you come?' she cried again, yet more passionately, and already half rising to her feet."
"Cependant, il avait quitté Marie pour Jésus, sacrifiant son cœur, afin de vaincre sa chair, rêvant de mettre de la virilité dans sa foi. Marie le troublait trop, avec ses minces bandeaux, ses mains tendues, son sourire de femme. Il ne pouvait s’agenouiller devant elle, sans baisser les yeux, de peur d’apercevoir le bord de ses jupes. Puis, il l’accusait de s’être faite trop douce pour lui, autrefois ; elle l’avait si longtemps gardé entre les plis de sa robe, qu’il s’était laissé glisser de ses bras dans ceux de la créature, en ne s’apercevant même pas qu’il changeait de tendresse. Et il se rappelait les brutalités de Frère Archangias, son refus d’adorer Marie, le regard méfiant dont il semblait la surveiller. Lui, désespérait de se hausser jamais à cette rudesse ; il la délaissait simplement, cachait ses images, désertait son autel. Mais elle restait au fond de son cœur, comme un amour inavoué, toujours présente. Le péché, par un sacrilège dont l’horreur l’anéantissait, se servait d’elle pour le tenter. Lorsqu’il l’invoquait encore, à certaines heures d’attendrissement invincible, c’était Albine qui se présentait, dans le voile blanc, l’écharpe bleue nouée à la ceinture, avec des roses d’or sur ses pieds nus. Toutes les Vierges, la Vierge au royal manteau d’or, la Vierge couronnée d’étoiles, la Vierge visitée par l’Ange de l’Annonciation, la Vierge paisible entre un lis et une quenouille, lui apportaient un ressouvenir d’Albine, les yeux souriants, ou la bouche délicate, ou la courbe molle des joues. Sa faute avait tué la virginité de Marie. Alors, d’un effort suprême, il chassait la femme de la religion, il se réfugiait dans Jésus, dont la douceur l’inquiétait même parfois. Il lui fallait un Dieu jaloux, un Dieu implacable, le Dieu de la Bible, environné de tonnerres, ne se montrant que pour châtier le monde épouvanté. Il n’y avait plus de saints, plus d’anges, plus de mère de Dieu ; il n’y avait que Dieu, un maître omnipotent, qui exigeait pour lui toutes les haleines. Il sentait la main de ce Dieu lui écraser les reins, le tenir à sa merci dans l’espace et dans le temps, comme un atome coupable. N’être rien, être damné, rêver l’enfer, se débattre stérilement contre les monstres de la tentation, cela était bon. De Jésus, il ne prenait que la croix. Il avait cette folie de la croix, qui a usé tant de lèvres sur le crucifix. Il prenait la croix et il suivait Jésus. Il l’alourdissait, la rendait accablante, n’avait pas de plus grande joie que de succomber sous elle, de la porter à genoux, l’échine cassée. Il voyait en elle la force de l’âme, la joie de l’esprit, la consommation de la vertu, la perfection de la sainteté. Tout se trouvait en elle, tout aboutissait à mourir sur elle. Souffrir, mourir, ces mots sonnaient sans cesse à ses oreilles, comme la fin de la sagesse humaine. Et, lorsqu’il s’était attaché sur la croix, il avait la consolation sans bornes de l’amour de Dieu. Ce n’était plus Marie qu’il aimait d’une tendresse de fils, d’une passion d’amant. Il aimait, pour aimer, dans l’absolu de l’amour. Il aimait Dieu au-dessus de lui-même, au-dessus de tout, au fond d’un épanouissement de lumière. Il était ainsi qu’un flambeau qui se consume en clarté. La mort, quand il la souhaitait, n’était à ses yeux qu’un grand élan d’amour.","However, he had left Mary for Jesus, sacrificing his heart, in order to overcome his flesh, dreaming of putting virility in his faith. Marie disturbed him too much, with her thin headbands, her outstretched hands, her feminine smile. He could not kneel before her without lowering his eyes, for fear of seeing the edge of her skirts. Then he accused her of having been too gentle to him in the past; she had kept him so long between the folds of her dress that he had slipped from her arms into those of the creature, not even noticing that his tenderness was changing. And he remembered the brutality of Brother Archangias, his refusal to adore Mary, the wary gaze with which he seemed to watch her. He despaired of ever rising to such harshness; he simply forsook her, hid her images, deserted her altar. But she remained deep in his heart, like an unacknowledged love, always present. Sin, by a sacrilege whose horror annihilated him, made use of her to tempt him. When he still invoked her, at certain hours of invincible tenderness, it was Albine who presented herself, in the white veil, the blue scarf tied at the belt, with golden roses on her bare feet. All the Virgins, the Virgin in the royal golden mantle, the Virgin crowned with stars, the Virgin visited by the Angel of the Annunciation, the peaceful Virgin between a lily and a distaff, brought him a memory of Albina, the smiling eyes, or the delicate mouth, or the soft curve of the cheeks. His fault had killed Mary's virginity. Then, with a supreme effort, he drove the woman out of religion, he took refuge in Jesus, whose gentleness even sometimes worried him. He needed a jealous God, an implacable God, the God of the Bible, surrounded by thunders, showing himself only to chastise the terrified world. There were no more saints, no more angels, no more mother of God; there was only God, an omnipotent master, who demanded all the breath for him. He felt the hand of this God crushing his loins, holding him at his mercy in space and time, like a guilty atom. To be nothing, to be damned, to dream of hell, to struggle fruitlessly against the monsters of temptation, that was good. From Jesus, he took only the cross. He had this madness of the cross, which used so many lips on the crucifix. He took up the cross and followed Jesus. He weighed her down, made her overwhelming, had no greater joy than to succumb under her, to carry her to her knees, her spine broken. He saw in it the strength of the soul, the joy of the spirit, the consummation of virtue, the perfection of holiness. Everything was in her, everything ended up dying on her. Suffer, die, these words rang incessantly in his ears, like the end of human wisdom. And when he tied himself to the cross, he had the boundless consolation of God's love. It was no longer Marie whom he loved with the tenderness of a son, with the passion of a lover. He loved, to love, in the absolute of love. He loved God above himself, above everything, in the depths of a flowering of light. He was like a torch burning brightly. Death, when he wished it, was in his eyes only a great surge of love.","Meanwhile, he had abandoned Mary for Jesus, sacrificing his heart in order to conquer his body, striving to put virility into his faith. Mary troubled him too much with her narrow bands of hair, her outstretched hands, and womanly smile. He could not kneel before her without lowering his eyes for fear of seeing the hem of her skirts. He also accused her of making herself too kind to him in former times; she had kept him so long in the folds of her skirt that he had let himself slide from her arms into the arms of a human creature, without even noticing that he was transferring his affections. And he remembered the brutalities of Brother Archangias, his refusal to worship Mary, and the suspicious gaze with which he seemed to look at her. He despaired of ever reaching that degree of roughness; he simply neglected her, hid her pictures, and deserted her altar. But she remained deep in his heart, like an unacknowledged love, always present. With a sacrilege that filled him with horror, sin had made use of her to tempt him. When he still called upon her at moments of irresistible tenderness, it was Albine who appeared in the white veil, with the blue sash tied round her waist, and the gold roses on her bare feet. All the different images of the Virgin — the Virgin with the golden royal cloak, the Virgin with the crown of stars, the Virgin visited by the angel of the Annunciation, the peaceful Virgin standing between a lily and a distaff — all brought back to him the memory of Albine, her smiling eyes, her delicate mouth, or the soft curve of her cheeks. His sin had killed the virginity of Mary. So, with a supreme effort, he drove womanhood out of religion, taking refuge in Jesus, whose gentleness also disturbed him sometimes. He needed a jealous God, an implacable God, the God of the Bible, surrounded by thunder, showing himself only to punish the terrified world. There were no more saints, no more angels, no more mother of God; there was only God, God the omnipotent master, who demanded every breath for himself. He felt the hand of God crushing his back, holding him at his mercy in space and time, like a guilty atom. To be nothing, to be damned, to long for hell, to struggle in vain against the monsters of temptation, that was good. From Jesus he would take only the cross. He had that same obsession with the cross that has worn away so many lips upon the crucifix. He took the cross, and he followed Jesus. He made it heavier, made it crushing, and had no greater joy than to collapse beneath it, and carry it when he was on his knees, his back broken. He saw in the cross the strength of the soul, the joy of the spirit, the supreme achievement of virtue, the perfection of sanctity. In the cross there was everything, and everything led to dying upon it. Suffering, dying, these words resounded constantly in his ears, like the peak of human wisdom. And when he had attached himself to the cross, he had the boundless consolation of the love of God. It was no longer Mary that he loved with filial tenderness and the passion of a lover. He loved for the sake of loving, in the absoluteness of love. He loved God more than himself, more than all else, in a splendour of light. He was like a torch that consumes itself in light. Death, when he wished for it, was in his eyes only a great surge of love.","Yet he had put aside Mary for Jesus, sacrificing his heart that he might subdue his flesh, and hoping to implant some virility in his faith. Mary disquieted him too much, with her smoothly braided hair, her outstretched hands, and her womanly smile. He could never kneel before her without dropping his eyes, for fear of catching sight of the hem of her dress. Then, too, he accused her of having treated him too tenderly in former times. She had kept him sheltered so long within the folds of her robe, that he had let himself slip from her arms to those of a human creature without being conscious even of the change of his affection. He thought of all the roughness of Brother Archangias, of his refusal to worship Mary, of the distrustful glances with which he had seemed to watch her. He himself despaired of ever rising to such a height of roughness, and so he simply left her, hiding her images and deserting her altar. Yet she remained in his heart, like some love which, though unavowed, is ever present. Sin, with sacrilege whose very horror made him shudder, made use of her to tempt him. Whenever he still invoked her, as he did at times of irrepressible emotion, it was Albine who showed herself beneath the white veil, with the blue scarf knotted round her waist and the golden roses blooming on her bare feet. All the representations of the Virgin, the Virgin with the royal mantle of cloth-of-gold, the Virgin crowned with stars, the Virgin visited by the Angel of the Annunciation, the peaceful Virgin poised between a lily and a distaff, all brought him some memory of Albine, her smiling eyes or her delicately curved mouth or her softly rounded cheeks. Thereupon, by a supreme effort, he drove the female element from his worship, and sought refuge in Jesus, though even His gentle mildness sometimes proved a source of disquietude to him. What he needed was a jealous God, an implacable God, the Jehovah of the Old Testament, girded with thunder and manifesting Himself only to chastise the terrified world. He had done with the saints and the angels and the Divine Mother; he bowed down before God Himself alone, the omnipotent Master, who demanded from him his every breath. And he felt the hand of this God laid heavily upon him, holding him helpless at His mercy through space and time, like a guilty atom. Ah! to be nothing, to be damned, to dream of hell, to wrestle vainly against hideous temptations, all that was surely good. From Jesus he took but the cross. He was seized with that passion for the cross which has made so many lips press themselves again and again to the crucifix till they were worn away with kissing. He took up the cross and followed Jesus. He sought to make it heavier, the mightiest of burdens; it was great joy to him to fall beneath its weight, to drag it on his knees, his back half broken. In it he beheld the only source of strength for the soul, of joy for the mind, of the consummation of virtue and the perfection of holiness. In it lay all that was good; all ended in death upon it. To suffer and to die, those words ever sounded in his ears, as the end and goal of mortal wisdom. And, when he had fastened himself to the cross, he enjoyed the boundless consolation of God's love. It was no longer, now, upon Mary that he lavished filial tenderness or lover's passion. He loved for love's mere sake, with an absolute abstract love. He loved God with a love that lifted him out of himself, out of all else, and wrapped him round with a dazzling radiance of glory. He was like a torch that burns away with blazing light. And death seemed to him to be only a great impulse of love."

"Ces paroles si simples, baignées de larmes muettes, prenaient dans la nuit un tel caractère de douleur sublime, que Frère Archangias lui-même, malgré sa rudesse, se sentit troublé. Il n’ajouta pas un mot, secouant sa soutane, essuyant sa joue saignante. Lorsqu’ils furent devant la maison des Bambousse, il refusa d’entrer. Il s’assit, à quelques pas, sur la caisse renversée d’une vieille charrette, où il attendit avec une patience de dogue.","These words, so simple, bathed in silent tears, took on such a character of sublime sorrow in the night that Brother Archangias himself, in spite of his roughness, felt troubled.

He sat down, a few steps away, on the overturned body of an old cart, where he waited with the patience of a mastiff.","These simple words, bathed in silent tears, took on, in the night, such an aspect of sublime grief that Brother Archangias himself, for all his crudeness, felt troubled.

He sat down a few steps away, on the overturned frame of an old cart, and waited with the patience of a faithful dog.","Those simple words, bathed with silent tears, fell on the night air with such an expression of superhuman suffering, that even Brother Archangias, in spite of all his harshness, felt touched.

He seated himself, a few yards away, on the body of an overturned cart, where he waited for the Abbe with dog-like patience."
"Et jamais ce mot : « Je t’aime » n’avait eu pour eux un sens si souverain. Il signifiait tout, il expliquait tout. Pendant un temps qu’ils ne purent mesurer, ils restèrent là, dans un repos délicieux, s’étreignant encore. Ils éprouvaient une perfection absolue de leur être. La joie de la création les baignait, les égalait aux puissances mères du monde, faisait d’eux les forces mêmes de la terre.

"Il chancelait. Albine dut l’asseoir dans un fauteuil. Là, il resta deux heures sans parler. Le menton sur les mains, il regardait.

"Albine se fâcha. Elle répétait ce que tout le monde savait. Le seigneur avait fait bâtir le pavillon, pour y loger cette inconnue qui ressemblait à une princesse. Les gens du château, plus tard, assuraient qu’il y passait les jours et les nuits. Souvent aussi, ils l’apercevaient dans une allée, menant les petits pieds de l’inconnue au fond des taillis les plus noirs. Mais, pour rien au monde, ils ne se seraient hasardés à guetter le couple, qui battait le parc pendant des semaines entières.","Albine got angry. She repeated what everyone knew. The lord had built the pavilion, to house this stranger who looked like a princess. The people of the castle, later, ensured that he spent days and nights there.

But, for nothing in the world, they would not have ventured to watch the couple, who beat the park for whole weeks.","This irritated Albine. She was only repeating what everybody knew.

But nothing would have persuaded them to dare spy on the couple who walked in the park for weeks on end.","Albine seemed put out. She repeated to him what every one in the neighbourhood knew.

"Et il continua sa rêverie. Jamais il n’avait vu les choses sous un jour aussi éclatant. Tout lui semblait aisé, à présent, tant il se jugeait fort. Puisque Albine l’attendait, il irait la rejoindre. Cela était naturel. Le matin, il avait bien marié le grand Fortuné à la Rosalie. L’Église ne défendait pas le mariage. Il les voyait encore se souriant, se poussant du coude sous ses mains qui les bénissaient. Puis, le soir, on lui avait montré leur lit. Chacune des paroles qu’il leur avait adressées éclatait plus haut à ses oreilles. Il disait au grand Fortuné que Dieu lui envoyait une compagne, parce qu’il n’a pas voulu que l’homme vécût solitaire. Il disait à la Rosalie qu’elle devait s’attacher à son mari, ne le quitter jamais, être sa servante soumise. Mais il disait aussi ces choses pour lui et pour Albine. N’était-elle pas sa compagne, sa servante soumise, celle que Dieu lui envoyait, afin que sa virilité ne se séchât pas dans la solitude ? D’ailleurs, ils étaient liés. Il restait très surpris de ne pas avoir compris cela tout de suite, de ne pas s’en être allé avec elle, comme le devoir l’exigeait. Mais c’était chose décidée, il la rejoindrait, dès le lendemain. En une demi-heure, il serait auprès d’elle. Il traverserait le village, il prendrait le chemin du coteau ; c’était de beaucoup le plus court. Il pouvait tout, il était le maître, personne ne lui dirait rien. Si on le regardait, il ferait, d’un geste, baisser toutes les têtes. Puis, il vivrait avec Albine. Il l’appellerait sa femme. Ils seraient très heureux. L’or montait de nouveau, ruisselait entre ses doigts. Il rentrait dans un bain d’or. Il emportait les vases sacrés pour les besoins de son ménage, menant grand train, payant ses gens avec des fragments de calice qu’il tordait entre ses doigts, d’un léger effort. Il mettait à son lit de noces les rideaux de drap d’or de l’autel. Comme bijoux, il donnait à sa femme les cœurs d’or, les chapelets d’or, les croix d’or, pendus au cou de la Vierge et des Saintes. L’église même, s’il l’élevait d’un étage, pourrait leur servir de palais. Dieu n’aurait rien à dire, puisqu’il permettait d’aimer. Du reste, que lui importait Dieu ! N’était-ce pas lui, à cette heure, qui était Dieu, avec ses pieds d’or que la foule baisait, et qui accomplissait des miracles.","And he continued his reverie. He had never seen things in such a bright light. Everything seemed easy to him now, he considered himself so strong. Since Albine was expecting him, he would join her. It was natural. In the morning, he had indeed married the tall Fortuné to Rosalie. The Church did not forbid marriage. He could still see them smiling at each other, nudging each other under his blessing hands. Then, in the evening, he had been shown their bed. Every word he had spoken to them rang louder in his ears. He said to the great Fortunate that God sent him a companion, because he did not want the man to live alone. He told Rosalie that she should become attached to her husband, never leave him, be his submissive servant. But he also said these things for himself and for Albine. Was she not his companion, his submissive servant, the one whom God sent to him, so that his virility would not dry up in solitude? Besides, they were related. He was still very surprised that he hadn't understood that right away, that he hadn't gone with her, as duty demanded. But it was decided, he would join her the next day. In half an hour he would be with her. He would cross the village, he would take the hillside path; it was by far the shortest. He could do anything, he was the master, no one would tell him anything. If we looked at him, he would, with a gesture, lower all heads. Then he would live with Albine. He would call her his wife. They would be very happy. The gold was rising again, streaming through his fingers. He was entering a bath of gold. He carried away the sacred vessels for the needs of his household, leading the way, paying his people with fragments of chalice which he twisted between his fingers, with a slight effort. He draped the altar curtains of gold on his wedding bed. As jewels, he gave his wife the hearts of gold, the rosaries of gold, the crosses of gold, hung around the necks of the Virgin and the Saints. The church itself, if he raised it one story, could serve as their palace. God would have nothing to say, since he allowed to love. Besides, what did God matter to him! Was it not he, at that hour, who was God, with his golden feet that the crowd kissed, and who performed miracles.","And he continued his reverie. Never had things appeared to him with such total clarity. Everything now seemed easy, so strong did he feel. Since Albine was waiting for him, he would go and join her. That was only natural. In the morning he had married big Fortuné and Rosalie. The Church did not forbid marriage. He could see them again, smiling at each other, nudging each other, even as his hands were blessing them. Then in the evening he had been shown their bed. Every one of the words he had spoken to them now burst loudly upon his ears. He had told Fortuné that God was sending him a companion, because he did not want man to live alone. He had told Rosalie that she must bind herself to her husband, never leave him, and be his faithful servant. But he had said all those things also for himself and Albine. Was she not also his companion, his faithful servant, the one sent to him by God so that his virility should not wither away in solitude? Besides they were already bound together. He remained surprised that he had not understood that immediately, and not gone away with her, as duty demanded he should. But it was decided now, he would rejoin her on the morrow. He could be with her in half an hour. He would go through the village and take the hill path; it was much shorter that way. He could do everything, he was the master, no one could say anything. If people looked at him, he would make a gesture that would make them bow their heads. Then he would live with Albine. He would call her his wife. They would be very happy. The gold climbed yet higher, and streamed between his fingers. He was once more in a bath of gold. The sacred vessels he carried off for use in his household, which would be very grand, and people would be paid with bits of chalice that he fairly easily twisted off with his fingers. He hung over his marriage bed the curtains of cloth of gold from the altar. For jewels, he gave his wife the gold hearts, the gold chaplets, and the gold crosses hanging round the neck of the Virgin and the saints. The church itself, if he added one more floor, could serve as their palace. God would have no objections, since loving was allowed. Anyway, what did God matter! Wasn’t it now he himself who was God, with his feet of gold that the crowd came and kissed, his feet that worked miracles?","He still pursued his reverie. Never before had he seen things under such a favourable light. Everything seemed quite easy to him now that he once more felt full of strength. Since Albine was waiting for him, he would go and join her. It was only natural. On the previous morning he had married Fortune and Rosalie. The Church did not forbid marriages. He saw that young couple again as they knelt before him, smiling and nudging each other while his hands were held over them in benediction. Then, in the evening, they had shown him their room. Each word that he had spoken to them echoed loudly in his ear. He had told Fortune that God had sent him a companion, because He did not wish man to live alone; and he had told Rosalie that she must cleave to her husband, never leaving him, but always acting as his obedient helpmate. But he had said these things also for Albine and himself. Was she not his companion, his obedient helpmate, whom God had sent to him that his manhood might not wither up in solitude? Besides, they had been joined the one to the other. He felt surprised that he had not understood and recognised it at once; that he had not gone away with her, as his duty plainly required that he should have done. But he had quite made up his mind now; he would certainly join her in the morning. He could be with her in half an hour. He would go through the village, and take the road up the hill; it was much the shortest way. He could do what he pleased; he was the master, and no one would presume to say anything to him. If any one looked at him, a wave of his hand would force them to bend their heads. He would live with Albine. He would call her his wife. They would be very happy together. The golden stream mounted still higher, and played amongst his fingers. Again did he seem to be immersed in a bath of gold. He would take the altar-vases away to ornament his house, he would keep up a fine establishment, he would pay his servants with fragments of chalices which he could easily break with his fingers. He would hang his bridal-bed with the cloth-of-gold that draped the altar; and he would give his wife for jewels the golden hearts and chaplets and crosses that hung from the necks of the Virgin and the saints. The church itself, if another storey were added to it, would supply them with a palace. God would have no objection to make since He had allowed them to love each other. And, besides, was it not he who was now God, with the people kissing his golden miracle-working feet?"

"Ils restèrent muets, n’ayant pas encore eu jusque-là une sensation aussi heureuse de l’immensité du parc. Cela les ravissait, d’être seuls, au milieu d’un domaine si grand, qu’eux-mêmes devaient renoncer à en connaître les bords.","They remained silent, not having yet had such a happy feeling of the immensity of the park. It delighted them, to be alone, in the middle of a domain so vast, that they themselves had to give up knowing its edges.","They remained silent, never before having had so vivid a sense of the immensity of the park.

Your relatives, who started out like you, have committed their villainies without finding any consequent satisfaction... There’s a logic to it all, my boy. A priest completes the family. It was inevitable anyway. Our blood was bound to go that way in the end... So much the better for you, you’ve been the luckiest.’","'As for you, you're a parson,' he muttered; 'you did well; a parson's a very happy man. The calling absorbs you, eh?

"Elle se tut, elle fit quelques pas. Elle examinait la petite église. La pluie continuait à mettre aux vitres son ruissellement de cendre fine. Une lumière froide, trempée d’humidité, semblait mouiller les murs. Du dehors, pas un bruit ne venait, que le roulement monotone de l’averse. Les moineaux devaient s’être blottis sous les tuiles, le sorbier dressait des branches vagues, noyées dans la poussière d’eau. Cinq heures sonnèrent, arrachées coup à coup de la poitrine fêlée de l’horloge ; puis, le silence grandit encore, plus sourd, plus aveugle, plus désespéré. Les peintures, à peine sèches, donnaient au maître-autel et aux boiseries une propreté triste, l’air d’une chapelle de couvent où le soleil n’entre pas. Une agonie lamentable emplissait la nef, éclaboussée du sang qui coulait des membres du grand Christ ; tandis que, le long des murs, les quatorze images de la Passion étalaient leur drame atroce, barbouillé de jaune et de rouge, suant l’horreur. C’était la vie qui agonisait là, dans ce frisson de mort, sur ces autels pareils à des tombeaux, au milieu de cette nudité de caveau funèbre. Tout parlait de massacre, de nuit, de terreur, d’écrasement, de néant. Une dernière haleine d’encens traînait, pareille au dernier souffle attendri de quelque trépassée, étouffée jalousement sous les dalles.","She was silent, she took a few steps. She was examining the little church. The rain continued to lay its trickle of fine ash on the windows. A cold light, drenched in humidity, seemed to wet the walls. From outside, not a sound came, except the monotonous rolling of the downpour. The sparrows must have huddled under the tiles, the mountain ash raised vague branches, drowned in the dust of water. Five o'clock struck, torn suddenly from the cracked chest of the clock; then the silence grew still louder, more deaf, more blind, more desperate. The paint, barely dry, gave the high altar and the woodwork a sad cleanliness, the air of a convent chapel where the sun does not enter. A lamentable agony filled the nave, spattered with the blood that flowed from the limbs of the great Christ; while along the walls the fourteen images of the Passion displayed their atrocious drama, smeared with yellow and red, sweating horror. It was life that was dying there, in this shiver of death, on these altars resembling tombs, in the midst of this nudity of a funeral vault. Everything spoke of massacre, of night, of terror, of crushing, of nothingness. A last breath of incense trailed, like the tender last breath of some deceased, jealously smothered under the flagstones.","She stopped talking, and moved a few steps away. She was examining the little church. The rain was still pattering down the windows like grey ash. A cold rain-soaked light made the walls look wet. No sound came from outside save the monotonous rumble of the rain. The sparrows must have hidden away under the roof tiles, the rowan tree stretched out vague branches, drowned in a watery mist. The clock struck five, each stroke seeming torn, one after the other, from its cracked, wheezy chest; then the silence deepened, became more mute, more blind, more despairing. The new paintwork, scarcely dry, made the main altar and the woodwork look clean but gloomy, like a convent chapel that never sees the sun. The whole nave was filled with a terrible agony, splashed with the blood flowing from the limbs of the big Christ; and along the walls, the fourteen stations of the Cross displayed their atrocious drama, bedaubed with yellow and red, exuding horror. Life itself was agonizing here, in this shudder of death, in these altars like tombs, in all the bare starkness of a funeral vault. Everything spoke of slaughter, night, terror, extinction, and nothingness. A last whiff of incense hung in the air, like the last loving breath of some dead woman, lying jealously suffocated under the flagstones.","She ceased speaking, and took a few steps, examining the little church. The rain was still gently pattering against the windows; and the cold damp light seemed to moisten the walls. Not a sound came from outside save the monotonous plashing of the rain. The sparrows were doubtless crouching for shelter under the tiles, and the rowan-tree's deserted branches showed but indistinctly in the veiling, drenching downpour. Five o'clock struck, grated out, stroke by stroke, from the wheezy chest of the old clock; and then the silence fell again, seeming to grow yet deeper, dimmer, and more despairing. The priest's painting work, as yet scarcely dry, gave to the high altar and the wainscoting an appearance of gloomy cleanliness, like that of some convent chapel where the sun never shines. Grievous anguish seemed to fill the nave, splashed with the blood that flowed from the limbs of the huge Christ; while, along the walls, the fourteen scenes of the Passion displayed their awful story in red and yellow daubs, reeking with horror. It was life that was suffering the last agonies there, amidst that deathlike quiver of the atmosphere, upon those altars which resembled tombs, in that bare vault which looked like a sepulchre. The surroundings all spoke of slaughter and gloom, terror and anguish and nothingness. A faint scent of incense still lingered there, like the last expiring breath of some dead girl, who had been hurriedly stifled beneath the flagstones."

"— Non, je t’en supplie… Je ne veux rien du dehors. Cette branche qui est là me fatigue, à remuer, à pousser, comme si elle était vivante… Laisse ta main, je vais dormir. Il faut tout blanc… C’est bon.","“No, please… I don’t want anything from outside. This branch which is there tires me, to move, to grow, as if it were alive… Leave your hand, I am going to sleep.

Ah bien ! je t’aurais plutôt emporté sur mes épaules… Les autres ne savent pas ; mais toi tu sais bien qu’à présent je ne puis vivre ailleurs qu’à ton cou.","- I no longer suffer, she continued with a smile. I'm better, I'm cured, since I see you... Listen, I made myself sicker than I was, so that we could come and get you. I want to admit it now.

I would have rather carried you on my shoulders… The others do not know; but you know very well that now I can live nowhere but around your neck.","‘I’m not suffering any more,’ she went on with a smile. ‘I’m better now. I’m well again , now I can see you... Listen, I pretended to be more ill than I really was, so that they’d send for you. I can admit it now. It’s like that promise I made, to go away, to leave this part of the world, once I’d found you again, you can’t have imagined I would have kept it. Oh well! I would have carried you away on my shoulders rather than that... The others don’t know, but you know perfectly well that I can’t now live anywhere except in your arms.’","'I suffer no longer,' she said, with a smile. ' I am well again; I am cured, now that I see you once more——Listen! I made myself out worse than I really was, to induce them to go and fetch you. I am quite willing to confess it now. And that promise of going away, of leaving the neighbourhood, you didn't suppose I should have kept it, did you? No, indeed, unless I had carried you away with me on my shoulders. The others don't know it, but you must know that I cannot now live anywhere but at your side.'"
"Albine riait sur le seuil du vestibule. Elle avait une jupe orange, avec un grand fichu rouge attaché derrière la taille, ce qui lui donnait un air de bohémienne endimanchée.

Elle était comme un grand bouquet d’une odeur forte.","Albine was laughing on the threshold of the vestibule. She had on an orange skirt, with a big red kerchief tied behind her waist, which gave her the look of a gypsy in her Sunday best.

"— Sans doute, j’ai eu aussi bien du chagrin. Je suis encore toute pâle, n’est-ce pas ? Depuis huit jours, je vivais là, sur l’herbe où tu m’as trouvée.

I'm still so pale, aren't I? For eight days I had been living there, on the grass where you found me. I only wanted one thing, to see you enter through this hole in the wall.

"L’abbé Mouret passait les journées au presbytère. Il évitait les longues promenades qu’il faisait avant sa maladie. Les terres brûlées des Artaud, les ardeurs de cette vallée où ne poussaient que des vignes tordues, l’inquiétaient. À deux reprises, il avait essayé de sortir, le matin, pour lire son bréviaire, le long des routes ; mais il n’avait pas dépassé le village, il était rentré, troublé par les odeurs, le plein soleil, la largeur de l’horizon. Le soir seulement, dans la fraîcheur de la nuit tombante, il hasardait quelques pas devant l’église, sur l’esplanade qui s’étendait jusqu’au cimetière. L’après-midi, pour s’occuper, pris d’un besoin d’activité qu’il ne savait comment satisfaire, il s’était donné la tâche de coller des vitres de papier aux carreaux cassés de la nef. Cela, pendant huit jours, l’avait tenu sur une échelle, très attentif à poser les vitres proprement, découpant le papier avec des délicatesses de broderie, étalant la colle de façon à ce qu’il n’y eût pas de bavure. La Teuse veillait au pied de l’échelle. Désirée criait qu’il fallait ne pas boucher tous les carreaux, afin que les moineaux pussent entrer ; et, pour ne pas la faire pleurer, le prêtre en oubliait deux ou trois, à chaque fenêtre. Puis, cette réparation finie, l’ambition lui avait poussé d’embellir l’église, sans appeler ni maçon, ni menuisier, ni peintre. Il ferait tout lui-même. Ces travaux manuels, disait-il, l’amusaient, lui rendaient des forces. L’oncle Pascal, chaque fois qu’il passait à la cure, l’encourageait, en assurant que cette fatigue-là valait mieux que toutes les drogues du monde. Dès lors, l’abbé Mouret boucha les trous des murs avec des poignées de plâtre, recloua les autels à grands coups de marteau, broya des couleurs pour donner une couche à la chaire et au confessionnal. Ce fut un événement dans le pays. On en causait à deux lieues. Des paysans venaient, les mains derrière le dos, voir travailler monsieur le curé. Lui, un tablier bleu serré à la taille, les poignets meurtris, s’absorbait dans cette rude besogne, avait un prétexte pour ne plus sortir. Il vivait ses journées au milieu des plâtras, plus tranquille, presque souriant, oubliant le dehors, les arbres, le soleil, les vents tièdes, qui le troublaient.","Father Mouret spent his days at the presbytery. He avoided the long walks he took before his illness. The scorched lands of the Artauds, the ardor of this valley where only twisted vines grew, worried him. Twice he had tried to go out in the morning to read his breviary along the roads; but he had not gone beyond the village, he had returned, disturbed by the smells, the full sun, the width of the horizon. Only in the evening, in the cool of nightfall, did he venture a few steps in front of the church, on the esplanade which stretched as far as the cemetery. In the afternoon, to occupy himself, seized by a need for activity which he did not know how to satisfy, he had given himself the task of gluing paper panes to the broken panes of the nave. This, for eight days, had kept him on a ladder, very attentive to fitting the panes neatly, cutting the paper with the delicacy of embroidery, spreading the glue so that there were no smudges. La Teuse watched at the foot of the ladder. Désirée shouted that it was necessary not to block up all the windows, so that the sparrows might enter; and, so as not to make her cry, the priest forgot two or three at each window. Then, this repair finished, the ambition had impelled him to embellish the church, without calling in either a mason, or a carpenter, or a painter. He would do everything himself. This manual work, he said, amused him, gave him strength. Uncle Pascal, each time he went to the cure, encouraged him, assuring him that this fatigue was worth more than all the drugs in the world. From then on, Abbé Mouret filled the holes in the walls with handfuls of plaster, nailed the altars back together with great blows of a hammer, crushed colors to give a layer to the pulpit and the confessional. It was an event in the country. They were talking about it two leagues away. Peasants came, hands behind their backs, to see the priest working. He, a blue apron tight at the waist, his wrists bruised, absorbed himself in this hard work, had a pretext not to go out any more. He lived his days in the middle of the plaster, calmer, almost smiling, forgetting the outside, the trees, the sun, the warm winds, which troubled him.","Abbé Mouret spent his days in the presbytery. He avoided the long walks he used to take before his illness. The scorched land of Les Artaud, and the ardent heat of this valley where only twisted vines could grow, disturbed him. Twice he had tried to go out in the morning to read his breviary along the way; but he had got no further than the village; he had gone back home, disturbed by the smells, the sun, and the wide expanse of the horizon. Only in the evening, in the cool of the approaching night, did he venture to take a few steps in front of the church on the wide path that reached down to the cemetery. In the afternoon, gripped by a need for activity that he didn’t know how to satisfy, he had given himself the task of sticking panes of paper over the broken windows of the nave. That had kept him busy on a ladder for a week, very concerned to fix the panes in neatly, cutting the paper as delicately as if it were embroidery, and spreading the glue with great care to avoid smudges. La Teuse had stood at the foot of the ladder, watching over him. Désirée insisted that he shouldn’t fill all the panes, so the sparrows could still get in; and to spare her tears, he did leave one or two panes unmended in each window. When these repairs were finished, he conceived the ambitious idea of beautifying the church, with no help from any mason, carpenter, or painter. He would do it all himself. He said he enjoyed this manual work, and it helped him regain his strength. Uncle Pascal, whenever he called at the presbytery, encouraged him, assuring him that hard work of this sort did more good than all the drugs in the world. Thereupon Abbé Mouret set about filling the holes in the wall with handfuls of plaster, replacing nails in the altars with much wielding of hammers, and grinding some colours to give the pulpit and the confessional a new layer of paint. It was quite an event in the locality. People talked about it for miles around. Peasants came along with their hands behind their backs, to see Monsieur le Curé at work. He, with a blue apron tied round his waist, and bruised wrists, was absorbed in this crude task which gave him an excuse for not going out. He lived his days surrounded by rubble, more tranquil, almost smiling, forgetting the outside world, the trees, the sun, and the warm breezes that disturbed him.","Abbe Mouret spent his days at the parsonage. He shunned the long walks which he had been wont to take before his illness. The scorched soil of Les Artaud, the ardent heat of that valley where the vines could never even grow straight, distressed him. On two occasions, in the morning, he had attempted to go out and read his breviary as he strolled along the road; but he had not gone beyond the village. He had returned home, overcome by the perfumes, the heat, the breadth of the landscape. It was only in the evening, in the cool twilight air, that he ventured to saunter a little in front of the church, on the terrace which led to the graveyard. In the afternoons, to fill up his time, and satisfy his craving for some kind of occupation, he had imposed upon himself the task of pasting paper over the broken panes of the church windows, This had kept him for a week mounted on a ladder, arranging his paper panes with great exactness, and laying on the paste with the most scrupulous care in order to avoid any mess. La Teuse stood at the foot of the ladder and watched him. And Desiree urged that he must not fill up all the windows, or else the sparrows would no longer be able to get through. To please her, the priest left a pane or two in each window unfilled. Then, having completed these repairs, he was seized with the ambition of decorating the church, without summoning to his aid either mason or carpenter or painter. He would do it all himself. This sort of handiwork would amuse him, he said, and help to bring back his strength. Uncle Pascal encouraged him every time he called at the parsonage, assuring him that such exercise and fatigue were better than all the drugs in the world. And so Abbe Mouret began to stop up the holes in the walls with plaster, to drive fresh nails into the disjoined altars, and to crush and mix paints, in order that he might put a new coating on the pulpit and confessional-box. It was quite an event in the district, and folks talked of it for a couple of leagues round. Peasants would come and stand gazing, with their hands behind their backs, at his reverence's work. The Abbe himself, with a blue apron tied round his waist, and his hands all soiled with his labour, became absorbed in it, and used it as an excuse for no longer going out. He spent his days in the midst of his repairs, and was more tranquil than he had been before; almost cheerful, indeed, as he forgot the outer world, the trees and the sunshine and the warm breezes, which had formerly disturbed him so much."

'Yes, let all the jungles tower aloft and assail the walls with their thorny arms, let all the legions of insects swarm out of their holes in the ground and gnaw at the walls; the church, ruinous though it may seem, will never fall before the invasion of life. It is Death, Death the inexpugnable! . . . And do you know what will one day happen? The tiny church will grow and spread to such a colossal size, and will cast around such a mighty shadow, that all that nature, you speak of, will give up the ghost. Ah! Death, the Death of everything, with the skies gaping to receive our souls, above the curse-stricken ruins of the world!'"
"Puis, le soleil redescendit du lit, s’en alla à gauche, de son pas ralenti. Alors, Serge le regarda de nouveau tourner, s’asseoir de siège en siège, avec le regret de ne l’avoir pas retenu sur sa poitrine. Albine était restée au bord des couvertures. Tous deux, un bras passé au cou, virent le ciel pâlir peu à peu. Par moments, un immense frisson semblait le blanchir d’une émotion soudaine. Les langueurs de Serge s’y promenaient plus à l’aise, y trouvaient des nuances exquises qu’il n’avait jamais soupçonnées. Ce n’était pas tout du bleu, mais du bleu rose, du bleu lilas, du bleu jaune, une chair vivante, une vaste nudité immaculée qu’un souffle faisait battre comme une poitrine de femme. À chaque nouveau regard, au loin, il avait des surprises, des coins inconnus de l’air, des sourires discrets, des rondeurs adorables, des gazes cachant au fond de paradis entrevus de grands corps superbes de déesses. Et il s’envolait, les membres allégés par la souffrance, au milieu de cette soie changeante, dans ce duvet innocent de l’azur ; ses sensations flottaient au-dessus de son être défaillant. Le soleil baissait, le bleu se fondait dans de l’or pur, la chair vivante du ciel blondissait encore, se noyait lentement de toutes les teintes de l’ombre. Pas un nuage, un effacement de vierge qui se couche, un déshabillement ne laissant voir qu’une raie de pudeur à l’horizon. Le grand ciel dormait.","Then the sun came down from the bed again, went to the left, with his slower pace. Then Serge watched him turn again, sit down from seat to seat, regretting not having held him to his chest. Albine remained at the edge of the blankets. Both of them, an arm around their necks, saw the sky gradually pale. At times, an immense shiver seemed to whiten him with a sudden emotion. Serge's languor wandered there more at ease, finding there exquisite nuances he had never suspected. It was not all blue, but pink blue, lilac blue, yellow blue, living flesh, vast immaculate nudity that a breath made beat like a woman's breast. With each new glance, in the distance, he had surprises, unknown corners of the air, discreet smiles, adorable curves, gauzes hiding in the depths of paradise glimpsed of large superb bodies of goddesses. And he flew away, his limbs lightened by suffering, in the midst of this changing silk, in this innocent down of the azure; his sensations floated above his failing being. The sun was sinking, the blue was melting into pure gold, the living flesh of the sky was still blond, slowly drowning in all the shades of shadow. Not a cloud, an erasure of a virgin going to bed, an undressing leaving only a streak of modesty to be seen on the horizon. The great sky was sleeping.","Then the sun slipped down from the bed and went slowly away to the left. Then Serge watched it doing its rounds once again, sitting on one chair after another, sad that he had been unable to keep it with him, clutched to his breast. Albine had stayed there at the edge of the bedclothes. The two, with their arms around each other’s neck, watched the sky getting slowly paler. Now and again a huge shudder seemed to make it blench with some sudden emotion. Serge, in his languor, could now let his eyes roam more comfortably over this expanse, discovering exquisite subtleties he had never suspected. It wasn’t all entirely blue, there was pinkish blue, lilac blue, yellow blue, a living flesh, a vast, immaculate nakedness that heaved like a woman’s breast at the slightest breath. With each new glance into the distance there were surprises, unknown regions of the air, secret smiles, some adorable roundness, and fine veils hiding, in the depths of barely glimpsed paradises, huge and magnificent bodies of goddesses. And he was flying away, his limbs made light by illness, into this shimmering silk, this innocent down of blue; his sensations seemed to float above his faltering being. The sun was getting lower in the sky, the blue was melting into pure gold, the living flesh of the sky grew ever more blond, and slowly sank into all the tints of evening. Not a cloud, just the self-effacement of a virgin at bedtime, a disrobing that left nothing more than a line of modesty on the horizon. The vast sky slept.","But the sun crept down the bed again and slowly retreated to the left; and as Serge watched it bend once more and settle on chair after chair, he bitterly regretted that he had not kept it to his breast. Albine still sat upon the side of the bed, and the pair of them, an arm round each other's neck, watched the slow paling of the sky. At times a mighty thrill seemed to make it blanch. Serge's languid eyes now wandered over it more freely and detected in it exquisite tints of which he had never dreamed. It was not all blue, but rosy blue, lilac blue, tawny blue, living flesh, vast and spotless nudity heaving like a woman's bosom in the breeze. At every glance into space he found a fresh surprise —unknown nooks, coy smiles, bewitching rounded outlines, gauzy veils which were cast over the mighty, glorious forms of goddesses in the depths of peeping paradises. And with his limbs lightened by suffering he winged his way amid that shimmering silk, that stainless down of azure. The sun sank lower and lower, the blue melted into purest gold, the sky's living flesh gleamed fairer still, and then was slowly steeped in all the hues of gloom. Not a cloud—nought but gradual disappearance, a disrobing which left behind it but a gleam of modesty on the horizon. And at last the broad sky slumbered."
"— Serge, mon bon Serge, supplia de nouveau Désirée, ne sois pas méchant… Vois comme il est innocent, le cher petit. Je le débarbouillerai, je le tiendrai bien propre. C’est la Teuse qui se l’est fait donner pour moi. On ne peut pas le renvoyer maintenant… Tiens, il te regarde, il te sent. N’aie pas peur, il ne te mangera pas.","- Serge, my good Serge, begged Désirée again, do not be mean ... See how innocent he is, the dear little one. I'll wash it clean, I'll keep it clean. La Teuse got it for me. We can't send him away now… Look, he's looking at you, he feels you. Don't be afraid, he won't eat you.","‘Serge, my dear Serge,’ Désirée pleaded once more: ‘don’t be mean... Look how innocent he is, the dear little thing. I’ll wash him thoroughly, and keep him very clean. It was La Teuse who had him given to her for me. We can’t send him back now... There now, he’s looking at you, he’s smelling you. Don’t be alarmed, he won’t eat you.’","'Oh, Serge, dear old Serge,' begged Desiree again, 'don't be so unkind. See, what a harmless little thing he is! I'll wash him, I'll keep him very clean. La Teuse went and had him given her for me. We can't send him back now. See, he is looking at you; he wants to smell you. Don't be afraid, he won't eat you.'"
"Un frisson avait couru parmi les assistants. Lisa réfléchissait, disant d’un air ennuyé :","A shudder had run through the assistants. Lisa was thinking, saying with an annoyed air:","A shiver ran through those who were present. Lisa, looking thoughtful, said with a troubled air:","A shudder ran through those who were present.

"La dévotion de l’abbé Mouret pour la Vierge datait de sa jeunesse. Tout enfant, un peu sauvage, se réfugiant dans les coins, il se plaisait à penser qu’une belle dame le protégeait, que deux yeux bleus, très doux, avec un sourire, le suivaient partout. Souvent, la nuit, ayant senti un léger souffle lui passer sur les cheveux, il racontait que la Vierge était venue l’embrasser. Il avait grandi sous cette caresse de femme, dans cet air plein d’un frôlement de jupe divine. Dès sept ans, il contentait ses besoins de tendresse, en dépensant tous les sous qu’on lui donnait à acheter des images de sainteté, qu’il cachait jalousement, pour en jouir seul. Et jamais il n’était tenté par les Jésus portant l’agneau, les Christ en croix, les Dieu le Père se penchant avec une grande barbe au bord d’une nuée ; il revenait toujours aux tendres images de Marie, à son étroite bouche riante, à ses fines mains tendues. Peu à peu, il les avait toutes collectionnées : Marie entre un lis et une quenouille, Marie portant l’enfant comme une grande sœur, Marie couronnée de roses, Marie couronnée d’étoiles. C’était pour lui une famille de belles jeunes filles, ayant une ressemblance de grâce, le même air de bonté, le même visage suave, si jeunes sous leurs voiles, que, malgré leur nom de mère de Dieu, il n’avait point peur d’elles comme des grandes personnes. Elles lui semblaient avoir son âge, être les petites filles qu’il aurait voulu rencontrer, les petites filles du ciel avec lesquelles les petits garçons morts à sept ans doivent jouer éternellement, dans un coin du paradis. Mais il était grave déjà ; il garda, en grandissant, le secret de son religieux amour, pris des pudeurs exquises de l’adolescence. Marie vieillissait avec lui, toujours plus âgée d’un ou deux ans, comme il convient à une amie souveraine. Elle avait vingt ans, lorsqu’il en avait dix-huit. Elle ne l’embrassait plus la nuit sur le front ; elle se tenait à quelques pas, les bras croisés, dans son sourire chaste, adorablement douce. Lui, ne la nommait plus que tout bas, éprouvant comme un évanouissement de son cœur, chaque fois que le nom chéri lui passait sur la lèvre, dans ses prières. Il ne rêvait plus des jeux enfantins, au fond du jardin céleste, mais une contemplation continue, en face de cette figure blanche, si pure, à laquelle il n’aurait pas voulu toucher de son souffle. Il cachait à sa mère elle-même qu’il l’aimât si fort.","Abbé Mouret's devotion to the Virgin dated from his youth. As a child, a little wild, taking refuge in corners, he liked to think that a beautiful lady was protecting him, that two very gentle blue eyes, with a smile, followed him everywhere. Often, at night, having felt a light breeze pass over his hair, he would say that the Virgin had come to kiss him. He had grown up under this woman's caress, in this air full of the rustle of a divine skirt. From the age of seven, he satisfied his needs for tenderness, by spending all the money he was given to buy images of holiness, which he jealously hid, to enjoy them alone. And he was never tempted by the Jesuses carrying the lamb, the Christs on the cross, the God the Father leaning with a big beard at the edge of a cloud; he always returned to the tender images of Marie, to her narrow laughing mouth, to her slender outstretched hands. Little by little, he had collected them all: Marie between a lily and a distaff, Marie carrying the child like a big sister, Marie crowned with roses, Marie crowned with stars. It was for him a family of beautiful young girls, having a resemblance of grace, the same air of kindness, the same suave face, so young under their veils, that, in spite of their name of mother of God, he had no afraid of them like adults. They seemed to him to be his age, to be the little girls he would have liked to meet, the little girls from heaven with whom the little boys who died at seven must play eternally, in a corner of paradise. But he was serious already; growing up, he kept the secret of his religious love, seized by the exquisite modesty of adolescence. Marie grew old with him, always one or two years older, as befits a sovereign friend. She was twenty when he was eighteen. She no longer kissed him on the forehead at night; she stood a few paces away, her arms crossed, smiling chastely, adorably sweet. He no longer named her except in a low voice, his heart feeling like a fainting spell each time the beloved name passed over his lips in his prayers. He no longer dreamed of childish games at the bottom of the celestial garden, but of continuous contemplation, faced with this white face, so pure, which he would not have liked to touch with his breath. He hid from his mother herself that he loved her so dearly.","Abbé Mouret’s devotion to the Virgin dated from his childhood. As a rather shy child, given to hiding away in corners, he liked to think that a beautiful lady was looking after him, that two very gentle blue eyes followed him with their smile wherever he went. Often at night, when he felt a light breath upon his hair, he would say that the Virgin had come to kiss him goodnight. He had grown up with this feminine caress, in an atmosphere full of the rustling of divine robes. From the age of seven, he satisfied his need for loving by spending all the money he was given on religious pictures * that he carefully hid, to enjoy them by himself. And he was never tempted by those of Jesus with the lamb, or Christ on the cross, or God the Father leaning over a cloud with his great beard; he always went for the tender images of Mary, with her small, laughing mouth and her delicate hands outstretched. Little by little, he had collected them all, Mary standing between a lily and a distaff, Mary carrying the Child as if she were an elder sister, Mary with a crown of roses, Mary with a crown of stars. For him they were a family of beautiful young girls, alike in their grace and their kindly expression, with the same sweet face, and so young beneath their veils, that in spite of their being called the Mother of God, he was not afraid of them as he usually was of grown-ups. They seemed to him to be his own age, to be little girls he would have liked to meet, little girls from Heaven, with whom little boys who died at the age of seven would forever play in some part of paradise. But he was already a serious child, and as he grew older, a prey to the delicate sensitivities of adolescence, he kept to himself the secret of his religious love. Mary grew older with him, always one or two years older than he, as is desirable in one’s closest friend. She was twenty when he was eighteen. She no longer kissed his brow as he lay asleep; she stood a few paces away, with her arms folded, with her chaste and adorably sweet smile. He now spoke her name only under his breath, feeling a sort of fluttering at his heart each time the beloved name passed his lips in his prayers. He no longer dreamed of childish games in the garden of Heaven, but only of an everlasting contemplation in front of this white figure, so pure that he would not have dreamed of touching it with his breath. He hid even from his mother the intensity of his love for Mary.","Abbe Mouret's devotion to the Virgin dated from his early youth. Already when he was quite a child, somewhat shy and fond of shrinking into corners, he took pleasure in the thought that a lovely lady was watching over him: that two blue eyes, so sweet, ever followed him with their smile. When he felt at night a breath of air glide across his hair, he would often say that the Virgin had come to kiss him. He had grown up beneath this womanly caress, in an atmosphere full of the rustle of divine robes. From the age of seven he had satisfied the cravings of his affection by expending all the pence he received as pocket money in the purchase of pious picture-cards, which he jealously concealed that he alone might feast on them. But never was he tempted by the pictures of Jesus and the Lamb, of Christ on the Cross, of God the Father, with a mighty beard, stooping over a bank of clouds; his preference was always for the winning portraits of Mary, with her tiny smiling mouth and delicate outstretched hands. By degrees he had made quite a collection of them all—of Mary between a lily and a distaff, Mary carrying her child as if she were his elder sister, Mary crowned with roses, and Mary crowned with stars. For him they formed a family of lovely young maidens, alike in their attractiveness, in the grace, kindliness, and sweetness of their countenances, so youthful beneath their veils, that although they bore the name of 'Mother of God,' he had felt no awe of them as he had often felt for grown-up persons. They seemed to him of his own age, little girls such as he wished to meet with, little girls of heaven such as the little boys who die when seven years old have for eternal playmates in some nook of Paradise. But even at this early age he was self-contained; and full of the exquisite bashfulness of adolescence he grew up without betraying the secret of his religious love. Mary grew up with him, being invariably a year or two older than himself, as should always be the case with one's chiefest friend. When he was eighteen, she was twenty; she no longer kissed his forehead at night time, but stood a little further from him with folded arms, chastely smiling, ravishingly sweet. And he—he only named her now in a whisper, feeling as if he would faint each time the well-loved name passed his lips in prayer. No more did he dream of childish games within the garden of heaven, but of continual contemplation before that white figure, whose perfect purity he feared to sully with his breath. Even from his own mother did he conceal the fervour of his love for Mary."

"Et il lui baisait le visage, sur les yeux, sur la bouche, sur les joues. Il lui baisait les bras, à petits baisers rapides, remontant des doigts jusqu’aux épaules.

Il la baignait d’une pluie de baisers, tombant à larges gouttes, tièdes comme les gouttes d’une averse d’été, partout, lui battant le cou, les seins, les hanches, les flancs. C’était une prise de possession sans emportement, continue, conquérant les plus petites veines bleues sous la peau rose.","And he kissed her face, on her eyes, on her mouth, on her cheeks. He kissed her arms, with quick little kisses, rising from the fingers to the shoulders. He kissed her feet, he kissed her knees.

It was a no-nonsense, continuous takeover, conquering the tiniest blue veins under the pink skin.","And he kissed her face, kissed her eyes, her mouth, her cheeks.

It was an act of possession, calm and continuous, conquering even the tiniest blue veins beneath her roseate skin.","And as he spoke he kissed her lips, her eyes, her cheeks. He kissed her arms, with quick short kisses, from her fingers to her shoulders. He poured upon her a rain of kisses hot as a summer shower, deluging her cheeks, her forehead, her lips, and her neck. 'But if you are mine, I am yours,' said he; 'yours for ever; for I now well know that you are my queen, my sovereign, whom I must worship on bended knee."

"Jusqu’à la nuit, ils vécurent de ce mot aimer qui, sans cesse, revenait avec une douceur nouvelle. Ils le cherchaient, le ramenaient dans leurs phrases, le prononçaient hors de propos, pour la seule joie de le prononcer. Serge ne songea pas à mettre un second baiser sur les lèvres d’Albine. Cela suffisait à leur ignorance, de garder l’odeur du premier. Ils avaient retrouvé leur chemin, sans s’être souciés des sentiers le moins du monde. Comme ils sortaient de la forêt, le crépuscule était tombé, la lune se levait, jaune, entre les verdures noires. Et ce fut un retour adorable, au milieu du parc, avec cet astre discret qui les regardait par tous les trous des grands arbres. Albine disait que la lune les suivait. La nuit était très douce, chaude d’étoiles. Au loin, les futaies avaient un grand murmure, que Serge écoutait, en songeant : « Elles causent de nous. »","Until nightfall, they lived on this word love which constantly returned with a new sweetness. They looked for it, brought it back into their sentences, pronounced it out of place, for the sole joy of pronouncing it. Serge did not dream of placing a second kiss on Albine's lips. That was enough for their ignorance, to keep the smell of the first. They had found their way, not caring about the trails in the least. As they left the forest, dusk had fallen, the moon was rising, yellow, between the black greenery. And it was an adorable return, in the middle of the park, with this discreet star watching them through all the holes in the tall trees. Albine said that the moon followed them. The night was very soft, warm with stars. In the distance, the forests gave off a great murmur, which Serge listened to, thinking: ""They're talking about us."" »","Until nightfall, they lived on that word, love, which ceaselessly returned with a constantly new sweetness. They sought it out, brought it into every sentence, uttering it without any real cause, merely for the joy of saying it. Serge did not think of planting a second kiss upon Albine’s lips. Ignorant as they were, it was quite enough for them simply to keep the fragrance of that first one. They had now found their way, without paying the slightest attention to where they were going. As they came out from the forest, twilight had fallen and the moon was rising, yellow between the dark of the leaves. It was a delightful return journey, through the middle of the park with that discreet star watching them through the gaps in the tall trees. Albine said the moon was following them. The night seemed very soft, and warm with stars. In the distance, the forests made a great murmuring sound, to which Serge listened, and thought: ‘They’re talking about us.’","Until the evening closed round them they lived upon that one word 'love,' in which they ever seemed to find some new sweetness. They brought it into every sentence, ejaculated it inconsequentially, merely for the pleasure they found in pronouncing it. Serge, however, did not think of pressing a second kiss to Albine's lips. The perfume of the first sufficed them in their purity. They had found their way again, or rather had stumbled upon it, for they had paid no attention to the paths they took. As they left the forest, twilight had fallen, and the moon was rising, round and yellow, between the black foliage. It was a delightful walk home through the park, with that discreet luminary peering at them through the gaps in the big trees. Albine said that the moon was surely following them. The night was balmy, warm too with stars. Far away a long murmur rose from the forest trees, and Serge listened, thinking: 'They are talking of us.'"
"Lui, sans répondre, demeurait debout. Il avait les yeux au loin, il ne voyait pas cette enfant à ses pieds. Il parla seul. Il dit, dans le soleil :","He, without answering, remained standing.

"— Si vous croyez, cria-t-il, que vous allez guérir le pays, avec ce mariage !… Avant deux ans, Catherine sera grosse ; puis, les autres viendront, toutes y passeront. Du moment qu’on les marie, elles se moquent du monde… Ces Artaud poussent dans la bâtardise, comme dans leur fumier naturel.

No husbands, Monsieur le Cure, but a good thick stick!'"
"Il chancela, il garda le silence. Une souffrance abominable le serrait à la gorge ; mais il demeurait plus fort que la douleur. Il tenait la tête droite, il souriait presque des coins de sa bouche tremblante. Albine, de son regard fixe, le défia un instant. Puis, avec un nouvel emportement :","He staggered, he remained silent. An abominable pain gripped his throat; but it remained stronger than the pain. He held his head up, he almost smiled from the corners of his trembling mouth. Albine, with her fixed gaze, defied him for a moment. Then, with a new outburst:","He staggered, but kept silent. A dreadful suffering gripped his throat, but he remained strong, overcoming his pain. He held his head up straight, with even the hint of a smile at the corner of his trembling lips.

"Et elle s’écartait un peu, pour lui faire place. Mais lui, recula, se tint debout. Puis, comme elle l’invitait de nouveau, il se laissa glisser sur les genoux, à quelques pas.

"— Oui, ce coin-là est très fertile. Aussi le parc est-il une véritable forêt, au milieu des roches pelées qui l’entourent… D’ailleurs, c’est de là que le Mascle sort. On m’a parlé de trois ou quatre sources, je crois.","— Yes, that corner is very fertile. Also the park is a real forest, in the middle of the peeled rocks which surround it… Moreover, it is from there that the Mascle comes out. I was told about three or four sources, I believe.","‘Yes, this part is very fertile. Indeed, the park is a real forest, in the midst of the bare rocks that surround it on every side. Besides, this is where the Mascle rises. I think I was told there are three or maybe four springs.’","'Yes, that part is very fertile.

"— Ah ! C’est vous, monsieur le curé, gronda-t-il. Imaginez-vous que ce gredin est toujours fourré dans le cimetière.

It’s you, Monsieur le Curé,’ he growled. ‘This rascal, can you believe it, is always hanging about here. I don’t know what mischief he can get up to here...

' Just fancy, this rascal is always poking his nose into the graveyard. I don't know what he can be up to here. I ought to let go of him and let him smash his skull down there.

"L’abbé Mouret, en soutane, la tête nue, était revenu s’agenouiller au pied de l’autel. Dans la clarté grise tombant des fenêtres, sa tonsure trouait ses cheveux d’une tache pâle, très large, et le léger frisson qui lui pliait la nuque semblait venir du froid qu’il devait éprouver là. Il priait ardemment, les mains jointes, si perdu au fond de ses supplications, qu’il n’entendait point les pas lourds de la Teuse, tournant autour de lui, sans oser l’interrompre. Celle-ci paraissait souffrir, à le voir écrasé ainsi, les genoux cassés. Un moment, elle crut qu’il pleurait. Alors, elle passa derrière l’autel, pour le guetter. Depuis son retour, elle ne voulait plus le laisser seul dans l’église, l’ayant un soir trouvé évanoui par terre, les dents serrées, les joues glacées, comme mort.","Abbé Mouret, in a cassock, his head bare, had returned to kneel at the foot of the altar. In the gray light falling from the windows, his tonsure pierced his hair with a pale, very wide patch, and the slight shiver which bent his neck seemed to come from the cold he must have felt there. He prayed ardently, his hands clasped, so lost in the depths of his supplications that he did not hear the heavy steps of La Teuse, circling around him, without daring to interrupt him. This one seemed to suffer, to see him crushed thus, the broken knees. For a moment she thought he was crying. So she went behind the altar to watch for him. Since his return, she no longer wanted to leave him alone in the church, having found him one evening passed out on the ground, his teeth clenched, his cheeks frozen, as if dead.","Abbé Mouret in his cassock, bareheaded, had returned to kneel at the foot of the altar. In the grey light coming from the windows, his tonsure made a very wide, pale patch in his hair, and the slight shiver that made him bend his neck seemed to come from the cold he must be feeling there. He was praying ardently, with hands together, so lost in supplication that he didn’t hear the heavy steps of La Teuse as she went to and fro around him, not daring to interrupt him. She really seemed to suffer, seeing him like this, so crushed, and with worn-out knees. For a moment she thought he was weeping. Then she went behind the altar to keep an eye on him. Since his return, she didn’t like leaving him alone in the church, having found him one evening collapsed on the ground, with his teeth clenched and his cheeks ice-cold, as if he were dead.","Abbe Mouret, now wearing his cassock but still bareheaded, had come back to kneel at the foot of the altar. In the grey light that streamed through the window, his tonsure showed like a large livid spot amidst his hair; and a slight quiver, as if from cold, sped down his neck. With his hands tightly clasped he was praying earnestly, so absorbed in his devotions that he did not hear the heavy footsteps of La Teuse, who hovered around without daring to disturb him. She seemed to be grieved at seeing him bowed down there on his knees. For a moment, she thought that he was in tears, and thereupon she went behind the altar to watch him. Since his return, she had never liked to leave him in the church alone, for one evening she had found him lying in a dead faint upon the flagstones, with icy lips and clenched teeth, like a corpse."
"Alors, lui, voulut voir à son tour. Il se haussa à l’aide des poignets. Une haleine fraîche le frappa aux joues. Au milieu des joncs et des lentilles d’eau, dans le rayon de jour glissant du trou, la femme était sur l’échine, nue jusqu’à la ceinture, avec une draperie qui lui cachait les cuisses. C’était quelque noyée de cent ans, le lent suicide d’un marbre que des peines avaient dû laisser choir au fond de cette source. La nappe claire qui coulait sur elle avait fait de sa face une pierre lisse, une blancheur sans visage, tandis que ses deux seins, comme soulevés hors de l’eau par un effort de la nuque, restaient intacts, vivants encore, gonflés d’une volupté ancienne.","So he wanted to see in his turn. He lifted himself using his wrists. Fresh breath hit his cheeks. Amid the reeds and duckweed, in the slippery ray of light from the hole, the woman was on her back, naked to the waist, with a drapery that hid her thighs. It was some drowned woman of a hundred years, the slow suicide of a marble which pains had had to let fall to the bottom of this source. The clear sheet that flowed over her had made her face a smooth stone, a faceless whiteness, while her two breasts, as if lifted out of the water by an effort of the neck, remained intact, still alive, swollen with an ancient pleasure.","Then he too wanted to see. He hoisted himself up by his wrists. A cool breath struck his cheeks. In among the reeds and the duckweed, in the ray of light sliding from the hole, the woman lay on her back, naked to the waist, with some drapery concealing her thighs. It was some woman drowned a hundred years ago, the slow suicide of a marble figure, toppled by sorrows into the bottom of the fountain. The clear water flowing over her had made her face into a smooth stone, a featureless patch of white, while her two breasts, as if lifted out of the water by the arching of her neck, remained intact, as if still living, and swelling with some former rapture.","Then he, too, in his turn wanted to look, and pulled himself up. A cold breeze played upon his cheeks. In the pale light that glided through the hole, he saw the marble woman lying amidst the reeds and the duckweed. She was naked to the waist. She must have been drowning there for the last hundred years. Some grief had probably flung her into that spring where she was slowly committing suicide. The clear water which flowed over her had worn her face into a smooth expanse of marble, a mere white surface without a feature; but her breasts, raised out of the water by what appeared an effort of her neck, were still perfect and lifelike, throbbing even yet with the joys of some old delight."
"— Tu ne m’aimes plus, répéta encore Albine.","""You no longer love me,"" repeated Albine again.","‘You do not love me any more,’ Albine again repeated.",'You love me no longer!' Albine repeated once more.
— Et Serge ? murmura machinalement Albine.,"""And Sergius?"" muttered Albine mechanically.","‘And Serge?’ Albine asked, mechanically.","'And Serge?' murmured Albine, quite mechanically."
"Il parlait avec sa belle indifférence, en affectant de ne pas s’apercevoir de la présence de Frère Archangias. Mais celui-ci ayant poussé un grognement plus menaçant, il reprit :","He spoke with his beautiful indifference, affecting not to notice the presence of Brother Archangias. But the latter having uttered a more menacing growl, he resumed:","He spoke with a splendid indifference, pretending not even to have noticed the presence of Brother Archangias. But when the latter uttered a more threatening growl, he went on:","He spoke on in the most unconcerned manner, pretending that he did not notice the presence of Brother Archangias; but as the latter suddenly broke into an angry grunt, he added, 'Why, Cure, so you bring your pig out with you?'"
"Quand elle se vit découverte, elle eut des rires prolongés, sautant sur l’herbe comme un poisson blanc sorti de l’eau, se mettant sur le ventre, rampant sur les coudes, faisant le tour du cerisier, tout en continuant à happer les cerises les plus grosses.","When she saw herself uncovered, she laughed for a long time, jumping on the grass like a white fish out of water, lying on her stomach, crawling on her elbows, circling the cherry tree, while continuing to grab the the biggest cherries.","When she saw she had been spotted, she laughed long and loud, leaping on the grass like a white fish leaping on the water, turning over on her front, pushing herself along by the elbows, going round the tree, while continuing to capture the fattest cherries.","When she saw she was discovered, she broke out into a peal of laughter, and twisted about on the grass like a fish taken from the water. And finally, crawling along on her elbows, she gradually made the circuit of the tree, snapping up the plumpest cherries as she went along."
Il secouait le Frère de nouveau.,He shook the Brother again.,He gave the Brother another shaking.,And thereupon he gave the Brother another shaking. '
"— Oui, dit-il paisiblement, je suis venu.","— Yes, he said peacefully, I came.","‘Yes,’ he said calmly, ‘I have come.’","'Yes,' he answered calmly, 'I have come.'"
"Il était tombé sur les coudes, prosterné, dans une attitude écrasée d’adoration. Il posa un baiser au bord de la jupe d’Albine. Alors, comme si elle avait reçu ce baiser sur la peau, elle se leva toute droite. Elle portait les mains à ses tempes, affolée, balbutiante.","He had fallen on his elbows, prostrate, in a crushed attitude of adoration. He placed a kiss on the edge of Albine's skirt. So, as if she had received this kiss on the skin, she stood up straight. She raised her hands to her temples, panicked, stammering.","He had fallen forward on his elbows, prostrate in an attitude of total adoration. He placed a kiss on the hem of Albine’s skirt. At once, as if she had received that kiss upon her skin, she leaped to her feet. She clasped her brow with her hands, panic-stricken and stammering.","He had let himself sink upon his elbows, in an attitude of deep adoration. And he breathed a kiss upon the hem of Albine's skirt. But at this the girl sprang up, as though it was she herself that had received the kiss. She hid her brow with her hands, perturbed, quivering, and stammering forth: 'Don't!"
"Il s’arrêta, attendant que la Vierge abaissât ses yeux bleus, l’effleurât au front du bord de son voile. La Vierge restait enveloppée dans la mousseline jusqu’au cou, jusqu’aux ongles, jusqu’aux chevilles, tout entière au ciel, avec cet élancement du corps qui la rendait fluette, dégagée déjà de la terre.","He paused, waiting for the Virgin to lower her blue eyes, to brush his forehead with the edge of her veil. The Virgin remained enveloped in muslin up to her neck, to her fingernails, to her ankles, entirely in heaven, with that slenderness of body which made her slender, already disengaged from the earth.","He paused, waiting for the Virgin to lower her blue eyes upon him, and touch his brow with the hem of her veil. But she remained wrapped in muslin up to her neck, and down to her fingernails, down to her ankles, belonging totally to Heaven, with that upward thrust of her body that made her ethereal, as if already detached from the earth.","He stopped, waiting for the Virgin to look down upon him and touch his forehead with the edges of her veil. But she remained enwrapped in muslin to her neck and finger-nails and ankles, so slim, so etherealised, that she already seemed to be above earth, to be wholly heaven's own."
"Mais ce qui fâcha surtout la Teuse, ce fut d’apercevoir brusquement la Rosalie montant à l’autel comme les autres, avec son fagot.","But what especially annoyed La Teuse was seeing Rosalie suddenly come up to the altar like the others, with her faggot.","But what especially enraged La Teuse was suddenly catching sight of Rosalie going up to the altar with her bundle, along with the other girls.","However, the measure of La Teuse's wrath was filled when she suddenly perceived Rosalie coming up to the altar like the others with a bundle of boughs in her arms."

"Elle s’était penchée, elle donnait des tapes sur le ventre ballonné du cochon, en ajoutant :","She had leaned over, she was slapping the pig's swollen belly, adding:","She leaned over, and patted the pig’s bloated belly, adding:","And the girl stooped and patted the pig's plump belly, saying: 'Eh!"
"— Tu vas au bal ? demanda Serge, qui cherchait à la faire rire.","""Are you going to the ball?"" asked Serge, trying to make her laugh.","‘Are you off to a costume ball?’ asked Serge, trying to make her laugh.","And that shame of hers proved contagious. Serge, who first had jested, asking her if she were going to a ball, glanced at himself, and likewise felt alarmed and ashamed, to a point that he also wound foliage about his person."
"Elle se tourna vers le prêtre, le regarda en face.","She turned to the priest, looked him in the face.",She turned to face the priest.,"She turned to the priest, and looked him full in the face."
"Il roulait les longues boucles dans ses mains, les pressant sur ses lèvres, comme pour en faire sortir tout le sang d’Albine. Au bout d’un silence, il continua :","He rolled the long curls in his hands, pressing them to his lips, as if to squeeze out all of Albine's blood. After a silence, he continued:","He rolled the blonde curls in his hands, pressing them to his lips, as if to squeeze out of them all of Albine’s blood. After a silence, he went on:","He kept on passing the long curls through his hands, and pressing them to his lips, as if to squeeze from them all Albine's blood. And after an interval of silence, he continued: 'It's strange, before one's birth, one dreams of being born."
"Elle avait porté la main sur la soutane, comme pour en arracher l’étoffe. Lui, la repoussa du geste, sans la toucher. Il la regardait, il s’affermissait contre la tentation, en ne la quittant pas des yeux. Elle lui paraissait grandie. Elle n’était plus la gamine aux bouquets sauvages, jetant au vent ses rires de bohémienne, ni l’amoureuse vêtue de jupes blanches, pliant sa taille mince, ralentissant sa marche attendrie derrière les haies. Maintenant, un duvet de fruit blondissait sa lèvre, ses hanches roulaient librement, sa poitrine avait un épanouissement de fleur grasse. Elle était femme, avec sa face longue, qui lui donnait un grand air de fécondité. Dans ses flancs élargis, la vie dormait. Sur ses joues, à fleur de peau, venait l’adorable maturité de sa chair. Et le prêtre, tout enveloppé de son odeur passionnée de femme faite, prenait une joie amère à braver la caresse de sa bouche rouge, le rire de ses yeux, l’appel de sa gorge, l’ivresse qui coulait d’elle au moindre mouvement. Il poussait la témérité jusqu’à chercher sur elle les places qu’il avait baisées follement, autrefois, les coins des yeux, les coins des lèvres, les tempes étroites, douces comme du satin, la nuque d’ambre, soyeuse comme du velours. Jamais, même au cou d’Albine, il n’avait goûté les félicités qu’il éprouvait à se martyriser, en regardant en face cette passion qu’il refusait. Puis, il craignit de céder là à quelque nouveau piège de la chair. Il baissa les yeux, il dit avec douceur :","She had put her hand on the cassock, as if to tear off the stuff. He pushed her away with a gesture, without touching her. He looked at her, he strengthened himself against temptation, never taking his eyes off her. She seemed grown up to him. She was no longer the girl with the wild bouquets, throwing her bohemian laughter to the wind, nor the lover dressed in white skirts, bending her slender waist, slowing down her tender pace behind the hedges. Now a down of fruit blondened her lip, her hips rolled freely, her chest had the blossoming of a fat flower. She was a woman, with her long face, which gave her a great air of fertility. In its widened sides, life slept. On her cheeks, on edge, came the adorable maturity of her flesh. And the priest, enveloped in her passionate scent of a mature woman, took a bitter joy in defying the caress of her red mouth, the laughter in her eyes, the call in her throat, the intoxication that flowed from her at the slightest movement. He pushed his temerity so far as to seek on her the places he had kissed madly in the past, the corners of the eyes, the corners of the lips, the narrow temples, soft as satin, the nape of the neck of amber, silky as velvet. . Never, even on Albine's neck, had he tasted the bliss he felt in martyring himself, looking in the face this passion he refused. Then he was afraid of giving in to some new trap of the flesh. He lowered his eyes, he said gently:","She had laid her hand on his cassock as if intending to tear the fabric. He pushed her away with a gesture, without touching her. He gazed at her, strengthening himself against temptation, never taking his eyes off her. She seemed to have grown up. No longer was she the wild girl collecting bunches of wild flowers, casting her gypsy laughter to the winds, nor the lover in white skirts, bending her slim waist, and walking slowly and fondly between the hedges. Now a peachlike down adorned her lips, there was a freedom of movement in her hips , her bosom had blossomed like a ripe flower. She had become a woman, with her long, oval face seeming to express her fertility. Life lay dormant in her broadened frame. On her cheeks, and on her very skin, lay the adorable ripeness of her body. And the priest, wrapped in the passionate scent of the mature woman, felt a bitter joy in facing the caress of her red lips, the laughter of her eyes, the appeal of her bosom, the intoxication that flowed from her at her slightest movement. He pushed his courage so far as to seek out the places on her body that he had once madly kissed, the corners of her eyes, the corners of her lips, her narrow temples, soft as satin, her amber neck, silky as velvet. Never, not even in Albine’s arms, had he felt the happiness he now experienced in this voluntary martyrdom, as he boldly faced the passion he was refusing. Then he feared he might yield to some new temptation of the flesh. He lowered his eyes, and said softly:","She laid her hand on his cassock, as though to tear it off him; but he repulsed her with a gesture, without touching her. He looked at her now and strengthened himself against temptation by never allowing his eyes to leave her. She seemed to him to have grown taller. She was no longer the playful damsel adorned with bunches of wild-flowers, and casting to the winds gay, gipsy laughter, nor was she the amorosa in white skirts, gracefully bending her slender form as she sauntered lingeringly beside the hedges. Now, there was a velvety bloom upon her lips; her hips were gracefully rounded; her bosom was in full bloom. She had become a woman, with a long oval face that seemed expressive of fruitfulness. Life slumbered within her. And her cheeks glowed with luscious maturity. The priest, bathed in the voluptuous atmosphere that seemed to emanate from all that feminine ripeness, took a bitter pleasure in defying the caresses of her coral lips, the tempting smile of her eyes, the witching charm of her bosom, and all the intoxication which seemed to pour from her at every movement. He even carried his temerity so far as to search with his gaze for the spots that he had once so hotly kissed, the corners of her eyes and lips, her narrow temples, soft as satin, and the ambery nape of her neck, which was like velvet. And never, even in her embrace, had he tasted such felicity as he now felt in martyring himself, by boldly looking in the face the love that he refused. At last, fearing lest he might there yield to some new allurement of the flesh, he dropped his eyes, and said, very gently:"
"— N’importe, murmura la Rousse, il n’est pas vilain homme. La maladie l’a un peu vieilli ; mais ça lui va bien.

We have great experiences; but one behaves like a dishonest man.

"Alors, pendant une semaine, ce furent des soins délicats. Elle patientait, attendant qu’il grandît. À mesure qu’elle constatait certains éveils, elle se rassurait, elle pensait que l’âge en ferait un homme. C’étaient de légers tressaillements, lorsqu’elle le touchait. Puis, un soir, il eut un faible rire. Le lendemain, après l’avoir assis devant la fenêtre, elle descendit dans le jardin, où elle se mit à courir et à l’appeler. Elle disparaissait sous les arbres, traversait des nappes de soleil, revenait, essoufflée, tapant des mains. Lui, les yeux vacillants, ne la vit point d’abord. Mais, comme elle reprenait sa course, jouant de nouveau à cache-cache, surgissant derrière chaque buisson, en lui jetant un cri, il finit par suivre du regard la tache blanche de sa jupe. Et quand elle se planta brusquement sous la fenêtre, la face levée, il tendit les bras, il fit mine de vouloir aller à elle. Elle remonta, l’embrassa, toute fière.","So, for a week, it was delicate care. She was patient, waiting for him to grow up. As she noticed certain awakenings, she reassured herself, she thought that age would make a man of him. There were slight twitches when she touched him. Then, one evening, he gave a faint laugh. The next day, after having seated him in front of the window, she went down to the garden, where she began to run and call him. She disappeared under the trees, crossed patches of sunlight, came back, out of breath, clapping her hands. He, his eyes flickering, did not see her at first. But, as she resumed her course, again playing hide and seek, emerging behind each bush, throwing a cry at her, he finally followed the white patch of her skirt with his gaze. And when she abruptly planted herself under the window, her face raised, he stretched out his arms, pretending to want to go to her. She came back up, kissed him, quite proud.","Then, for a week, he needed delicate care. She waited patiently, waiting for him to grow up again. She gradually noticed some signs of awakening, and began to feel reassured, thinking age would make a man of him. There were slight tremblings when she touched him. Then one evening he gave a little laugh. The next day, after seating him by the window, she went down to the garden and began to run about, calling out to him. She disappeared under the trees, scampered through patches of sunlight and came back, breathless, clapping her hands. With his wavering gaze, he did not at first see her. But when she started off again, playing the same game of hide-and-seek, leaping up from behind the bushes and calling out to him, he at last began to follow the white patch of her skirt with his eyes. And when she suddenly came and stood firmly beneath the window, looking up at him, he held out his arms, his face showing he wanted to join her. She went back up and embraced him with pride.","For another whole week she lavished the tenderest care on him. She patiently waited for him to grow. And as she marked various symptoms of awakening perception, her fears subsided and she began to think that time might make a man of him. When she touched him now he started slightly. Another time, one night, he broke into a feeble laugh. On the morrow, when she had seated him at the window, she went down into the garden, and ran about in it, calling to him the while. She vanished under the trees, flitted across the sunny patches, and came back breathless and clapping her hands. At first his wavering eyes failed to perceive her. But as she started off again, perpetually playing at hide-and-seek, reappearing behind every other bush, he was at last able to follow the white gleam of her skirt; and when she suddenly came forward and stood with upraised face below his window, he stretched out his arms and seemed anxious to go down to her. But she came upstairs again, and embraced him proudly: 'Ah!"
"— Monte sur mon dos, dit Serge.","— Get on my back, said Serge.","‘Climb on to my back,’ said Serge.","'Get on to my back, then,' said Serge."
— Méfiez-vous de votre dévotion à la Vierge.,— Beware of your devotion to the Virgin.,‘Beware of your devotion to the Blessed Virgin.’,"Then once more he stopped, and lifting one of his hairy fingers added: 'Beware of your devotion to the Virgin.'"
"— Il a bien parlé tout de même, conclut la Rousse. Ces curés, ça va chercher un tas de choses auxquelles personne ne songe.","'He spoke well all the same,' concluded La Rousse. These priests are going to look for a lot of things that no one thinks of.","‘He spoke well, just the same,’ said La Rousse. ‘These priests manage to find a heap of things no one would think of.’","' He spoke very well, all the same,' remarked La Rousse. ' Those priests think of a lot of things that wouldn't occur to anybody else.'"
"Elle s’arrêta de nouveau, mais elle ne protesta plus, au milieu du grand recueillement du Paradou. Elle croyait comprendre, à cette heure. Sans doute, le jardin lui ménageait la mort comme une jouissance suprême. C’était à la mort qu’il l’avait conduite d’une si tendre façon. Après l’amour, il n’y avait plus que la mort. Et jamais le jardin ne l’avait tant aimée ; elle s’était montrée ingrate en l’accusant, elle restait sa fille la plus chère. Les feuillages silencieux, les sentiers barrés de ténèbres, les pelouses où le vent s’assoupissait, ne se taisaient que pour l’inviter à la joie d’un long silence. Ils la voulaient avec eux, dans le repos du froid ; ils rêvaient de l’emporter, roulée parmi les feuilles sèches, les yeux glacés comme l’eau des sources, les membres raidis comme les branches nues, le sang dormant le sommeil de la sève. Elle vivrait leur existence jusqu’au bout, jusqu’à leur mort. Peut-être avaient-ils déjà résolu qu’à la saison prochaine elle serait un rosier du parterre, un saule blond des prairies, ou un jeune bouleau de la forêt. C’était la grande loi de la vie : elle allait mourir.","She stopped again, but she no longer protested, in the midst of Paradou's deep contemplation. She thought she understood, at this hour. Without doubt, the garden spared him death as a supreme enjoyment. It was to death that he had led her in such a tender way. After love, there was only death. And never had the garden loved her so much; she had shown herself ungrateful in accusing him, she remained his dearest daughter. The silent foliage, the paths barred by darkness, the lawns where the wind was drowsing, were silent only to invite him to the joy of a long silence. They wanted her with them, in the rest of the cold; they dreamed of carrying it away, rolled among the dry leaves, the eyes frozen like spring water, the limbs stiffened like bare branches, the blood sleeping the sleep of the sap. She would live their existence until the end, until their death. Perhaps they had already decided that next season it would be a rosebush in the flower bed, a blond willow in the prairies, or a young birch in the forest. It was the great law of life: she was going to die.","Albine stopped again, but made no more protest, surrounded by the great, contemplative silence of the Paradou. She thought she understood now. The garden was doubtless arranging death for her, as a supreme pleasure. It was towards death that it had been leading her with such tenderness. After love, there was nothing else but death. And never had the garden loved her more; she had shown ingratitude in her accusations; she was still its most beloved daughter. The silent leaves, the paths blocked by darkness, the lawns on which the winds fell asleep, all remained quiet, only to invite her to the joys of a long silence. They wanted her with them, in the restfulness of the cold; they longed to bear her away, wrapped in their dry leaves, her eyes frozen like the water of the springs, her limbs stiffened like bare branches, her blood sleeping the sleep of all sap. She would live their existence to the very end, to their death. Perhaps they had already decided that next year she would be a rose tree in the flower garden, a pale willow in the grasslands, or a young birch tree in the forest. It was the great law of life: she was going to die.","She stayed her steps once more; but she no longer protested as she stood there amidst the deep stillness of the Paradou. She now believed that she understood everything. The garden doubtless had death in store for her as a supreme culminating happiness. It was to death that it had all along been leading her in its tender fashion. After love, there could be nought but death. And never had the garden loved her so much as it did now; she had shown herself ungrateful in accusing it, for all the time she had remained its best beloved child. The motionless boughs, the paths blocked up with darkness, the lawns where the breezes fell asleep, had only become mute in order that they might lure her on to taste the joys of long silence. They wished her to be with them in their winter rest, they dreamt of carrying her off, swathed in their dry leaves with her eyes frozen like the waters of the springs, her limbs stiffened like the bare branches, and her blood sleeping the sleep of the sap. And, yes, she would live their life to the very end, and die their death. Perhaps they had already willed that she should spring up next summer as a rose in the flower-garden, or a pale willow in the meadow-lands, or a tender birch in the forest. Yes, it was the great law of life; she was about to die."

"— Je vous vois, je sais que vous êtes nus… C’est une abomination. Êtes-vous une bête, pour courir les bois avec cette femelle ? Elle vous a mené loin, dites ! Elle vous a traîné dans la pourriture, et vous voilà tout couvert de poils comme un bouc… Arrachez donc une branche pour la lui casser sur les reins !","“I see you, I know you are naked… It is an abomination.

"— Il est trop tard, va ! murmura Albine, en s’affaissant au milieu des bouts de ronces coupés. Tu ne m’aimeras jamais assez.","- It's too late, go! muttered Albine, sinking amidst the bits of cut brambles. You will never love me enough.","‘Oh, it’s too late!’ murmured Albine, collapsing among the broken brambles. ‘You will never love me enough.’","Then they both vanished indoors, and Serge, distracted with all these revived memories, stretched out his arms. 'It is all over now,' faltered Albine, as she sank down amongst the broken brambles. ' You will never love me enough again.'"
"— Prenez garde ! vous retournez au péché… Il a suffi que cet homme passât, pour que toute votre chair eût un tressaillement. Je vous ai vu sous la lune, pâle comme une fille… Prenez garde, entendez-vous ! Cette fois Dieu ne pardonnerait pas. Vous tomberiez dans la pourriture dernière… Ah ! misérable boue, c’est la saleté qui vous emporte !","“Beware! you return to sin… It was enough for this man to pass away, for all your flesh to tremble. I saw you under the moon, pale as a girl... Take care, do you hear! This time God would not forgive. You would fall into the ultimate rot… Ah! miserable mud, it is the dirt that takes you!","‘Take care! you’re returning to sin... It was enough for that man just to pass by for your whole body to be shaken. I saw you in the moonlight, pale as a girl... Take care, do you hear? This time, God would not be forgiving. You would fall into the ultimate corruption... Ah! wretched clay that you are, it’s filth that’s carrying you away!’","You are lapsing into sin again. It was sufficient for that man to pass by to send a thrill through your whole body. I saw you by the light of the moon looking as pale as a girl. Take care! take care! Do you hear me?

"Et tu vaux mieux que tout le monde. Si tout le monde était comme ma grande bête, la terre serait trop belle.","And you are better than everyone. If everyone was like my great beast, the earth would be too beautiful.","And you’re worth more than all the others. If everyone were like my big animal, the earth would be so lovely.’","And you are worth more than all the others put together. Ah! if every one was like my big silly, this earth would be too beautiful!'"
"— Eh bien ! cria-t-elle, est-ce que j’ose monter ?","- Well ! she cried, do I dare go upstairs?","‘Well now! So I don’t dare to climb up, do I?’","When she was quite aloft at the end of a frail branch, which shook dangerously beneath her weight, she cried; 'Now you see whether I daren't climb.'"
"— Faites donc attention ! cria Frère Archangias aux paysans, lorsque ceux-ci penchèrent un peu le brancard, pour qu’il pût passer, sans s’accrocher à la grille. Vous allez tout flanquer par terre !","""So be careful!"" shouted Brother Archangias to the peasants, when they tilted the stretcher a little, so that he could pass without clinging to the railing. You'll knock everything down!","‘Be careful!’ shouted Brother Archangias at the peasants, as they tilted the stretcher a bit to get it through, without catching on the gate. ‘You’ll drop the whole thing on the ground!’","'Just be careful!' cried Brother Archangias to the peasants, as they slightly tilted the litter in order to get it through the gateway. ' You will be upsetting everything on to the ground!'"
"— Ça fait le brave, ça se croit bâti autrement que les autres hommes, parce que c’est curé… La vérité est que celui-là est joliment dur. J’en ai connu qu’on n’avait pas besoin de chatouiller si longtemps. Et il est capable de s’écraser le cœur, comme on écrase une puce. C’est son bon Dieu qui lui donne cette force.","""He's acting brave, he thinks he's built differently than other men, because he's a priest... The truth is that this one is pretty tough.""

It is his good God who gives him this strength.","‘It puts on a brave show, it thinks it’s made differently from other men because it’s a priest... The truth is that this one is really hard.

And he is quite capable of crushing his heart, just as one might crush a flea. It must be the Almighty who gives him his strength.'"
"Elle fut ravie de ce tutoiement. Elle s’approcha, s’accroupi devant le lit, pour mettre son visage à la hauteur du sien.","She was delighted with this familiarity. She came closer, crouched down in front of the bed, to bring her face up to his.","Albine was delighted at his addressing her with the familiar tu. * She drew near and crouched beside the bed, to bring her face in line with his.","but although this tutoiement has some bearing on the development of the story, it was impossible to preserve it in an English translation.—ED. His voice enchanted her. She went up to his bed and crouched beside it to bring her face on a level with his own. '"
"Un instant, elle resta debout, regardant autour d’elle. Elle songeait, elle cherchait si la mort était là. Et elle ramassa les verdures odorantes, les citronnelles, les menthes, les verveines, les baumes, les fenouils ; elle les tordit, les plia, en fabriqua des tampons, à l’aide desquels elle alla boucher les moindres fentes, les moindres trous de la porte et des fenêtres. Puis, elle tira les rideaux de calicot blanc, cousus à gros points. Et, muette, sans un soupir, elle se coucha sur le lit, sur la floraison des jacinthes et des tubéreuses.","For a moment she stood, looking around. She was thinking, she was looking to see if death was there. And she picked up the fragrant greens, lemongrass, mint, verbena, balsam, fennel; she twisted them, folded them, made stamps out of them, with the help of which she went to stop up the smallest cracks, the smallest holes in the door and the windows. Then she drew the white calico curtains, sewn with rough stitches. And, mute, without a sigh, she lay down on the bed, on the blooming hyacinths and tuberoses.","She stood and looked around for a moment. She was thinking, wondering whether death was there. And she gathered up the scented plants, the citronella, mint, verbena, balsam, and fennel; then she twisted and folded them, making them into thick wads which she used to block up the slightest gaps and holes in the door and the windows. Then she drew the curtains of roughly sewn white calico. And silently, without a sigh, she lay down on the bed, on the great flowering mass of hyacinths and tuberoses.","For a moment she remained standing, glancing around her. She was looking to see if death was there. And she gathered up the aromatic greenery, the southernwood, the mint, the verbenas, the balm, and the fennel. She broke them and twisted them and made wedges of them with which to stop up every little chink and cranny about the windows and the door. Then she drew the white coarsely sewn calico curtains and, without even a sigh, laid herself upon the bed, on all the florescence of hyacinths and tuberoses."
"Le parc leur causait une sourde inquiétude qu’ils ne s’expliquaient pas. Il y avait un danger au détour de quelque sentier, qui les guettait, qui les prendrait à la nuque pour les renverser par terre et leur faire du mal. Jamais ils n’ouvraient la bouche de ces choses ; mais, à certains regards poltrons, ils se confessaient cette angoisse, qui les rendait singuliers, comme ennemis. Cependant, un matin, Albine hasarda, après une longue hésitation :","The park caused them a dull uneasiness that they could not explain. There was a danger at the turn of some path, which was watching them, which would take them by the neck to knock them down and do them harm. They never spoke of such things; but, at certain cowardly glances, they confessed to each other that anguish which made them singular, as enemies. However, one morning, Albine ventured, after a long hesitation:","The park now filled them with a vague anxiety they could not explain. There was danger round every turn in the path, something dangerous that would seize them by the neck, throw them to the ground, and do them harm. They never mentioned these things; but certain cowardly looks told of the anguish that made them strange to each other, as if they were enemies. But one morning, after much hesitation, Albine ventured:","The thought of the park filled them with vague uneasiness which they could not understand. They felt that danger lurked for them in some by-path, and would seize them and do them hurt. They never spoke about these disquieting thoughts, but certain timid glances revealed to them the mutual anguish which held them apart as though they were foes. One morning, however, Albine ventured, after much hesitation, to say to Serge: 'It is wrong of you to keep always indoors."
"Le prêtre était debout, halluciné. Il crut qu’à ce nouveau blasphème l’église croulait. La nappe de soleil qui inondait le maître-autel avait grandi lentement, allumant les murs d’une rougeur d’incendie. Des flammèches montèrent encore, léchèrent le plafond, s’éteignirent dans une lueur saignante de braise. L’église, brusquement, devint toute noire. Il sembla que le feu de ce coucher d’astre venait de crever la toiture, de fendre les murailles, d’ouvrir de toutes parts des brèches béantes aux attaques du dehors. La carcasse sombre branlait, dans l’attente de quelque assaut formidable. La nuit, rapidement, grandissait.","The priest was standing, hallucinated. He believed that at this new blasphemy the church was crumbling. The sheet of sunlight that flooded the high altar had grown slowly, igniting the walls with a fiery redness. Sparks rose again, licked the ceiling, extinguished in a bleeding glow of embers. The church suddenly went dark. It seemed as if the fire of this setting star had just burst the roof, split the walls, opened gaping breaches on all sides to attacks from without. The dark carcass swayed, awaiting some formidable assault. The night was rapidly growing.","The priest stood there, hallucinating. He thought that at this new blasphemy the church was collapsing. The pool of sunlight that had drowned the main altar had gradually lengthened, lighting up the walls with a fiery redness. Little flames of light still arose and licked the ceiling, only to die in a bloody glow like burning coals. The church suddenly became totally dark. It seemed as if the fire of this setting sun had just burst the roof, split the walls, and everywhere made gaping breaches open to attacks from outside. The whole dark carcase of the building shook, in expectation of some terrible assault. And night very quickly deepened.","The priest stood erect, his mind all dazed and scared. He fancied that, at this fresh outburst of blasphemy, the church was falling down upon him. The sunlight, which had poured over the high altar, had gradually spread and mounted the walls like ruddy fire. Flames soared and licked the rafters, then died away in a sanguineous, ember-like glow. And all at once the church became quite black. It was as though the fires of the setting sun had burst the roof asunder, pierced the walls, thrown open wide breaches on every side to some exterior foe. The gloomy framework seemed to shake beneath some violent assault. Night was coming on quickly."
"Mais ce furent surtout les Amours peints au-dessus des portes qui occupèrent vivement Serge. Il se fâchait de ne pouvoir comprendre à quels jeux ils jouaient, tant les peintures étaient pâlies. Aidé d’Albine, il roula une table, sur laquelle ils grimpèrent tous les deux. Albine donnait des explications.","But it was above all the Cupids painted above the doors that kept Serge busy. He was angry that he could not understand what games they were playing, the paintings were so faded. Helped by Albine, he rolled up a table, on which they both climbed. Albine gave explanations.","But it was the cupids painted above the doors that especially fascinated Serge. It annoyed him that he couldn’t see what games they were playing, as the paintings had faded so much. With Albine’s help, he rolled up a table, and they both climbed on to it. Albine started explaining:","But it was the Cupids painted over the doors that more particularly attracted Serge's attention. He fidgeted at not being able to make out what they were playing at, for the paintings had grown very dim. Helped by Albine, he dragged a table to the wall, and when they both had climbed upon it, Albine began to explain things to him."
"D’un bond de chèvre, elle disparut, laissant une pluie de fleurs derrière elle. On entendit le claquement d’une porte, puis des rires derrière la maison, des rires sonores qui allèrent en se perdant, comme au galop d’une bête folle lâchée dans l’herbe.","With a goat's bound, she disappeared, leaving a rain of flowers behind her. We heard the slamming of a door, then laughter from behind the house, sonorous laughter that faded away, like the gallop of a mad beast let loose in the grass.","Then bounding away like a goat, she disappeared, leaving a shower of flowers behind her. The slam of a door was heard, then laughter from behind the house, resounding laughter that went off into the distance, like the gallop of some mad creature let loose in the grass.","Then bounding away like a goat, dropping a shower of flowers behind her, she disappeared. The slam of a door was heard, and from behind the house came bursts of laughter, which died away in the distance like the scampering rush of some mad animal let loose among the grass."
"— Le maudit ! Satan le pousse ! balbutia le Frère Archangias, en faisant ronfler une dernière pierre. Un vieux qu’une chiquenaude devrait casser ! Il est cuit au feu de l’enfer. J’ai senti ses griffes.","- Cursed ! Satan pushes him! stammered Brother Archangias, snoring a last stone. An old man that a flick should break! He is cooked in the fire of hell. I felt his claws.","‘That cursed wretch! Satan drives him on!’ stammered Brother Archangias, throwing one last stone. ‘An old man who should be crushed by the flick of a finger. He’s been baked by the fires of hell. I felt his claws.’","'The accursed one!—Satan carries him on!' shrieked Brother Archangias, as he hurled his last stone. ' An old scoundrel, that the least touch ought to upset! But he is baked in hell's fire. I smelt his claws.'"
"— Je ne sais pas… Et que disait-il, ton oiseau ?","- I do not know ... And what was he saying, your bird?","‘I don’t know... And what did he say, your bird?’",'I don't know. What did your bird say to you?'
"— Non, tais-toi, tu me désoles, interrompit Serge inquiet. Je veux que nous vivions au soleil, loin de cette ombre mortelle. Tes paroles me troublent, comme si elles nous poussaient à quelque malheur irréparable. Ça doit être défendu de s’asseoir sous un arbre dont l’ombrage donne un tel frisson.","- No, shut up, you're sorry, interrupted Serge worried. I want us to live in the sun, far from this deadly shadow. Your words disturb me, as if they were pushing us towards some irreparable misfortune. It must be forbidden to sit under a tree whose shade gives such shivers.","Serge interrupted: ‘No, enough of that, you’re making me very unhappy, I want us to live in the sun, far from that deadly shade. Your words are upsetting me, as if they were pushing us towards some irreparable disaster. It should be forbidden to sit under a tree whose shade has such an effect.’","'Don't talk like that,' interrupted Serge. ' You make me feel so unhappy. I would rather that we should live in the bright sunlight, far away from that fatal shade. Your words distress me, as though they urged us to some irreparable misfortune. It must be forbidden to sit beneath a tree whose shade can thus affect one.'"
"— Je l’ai appelé Mathieu, parce qu’il ressemble à ce gros homme qui apporte les lettres ; il est devenu joliment fort… Tu n’es pas aimable de refuser toujours de le voir. Un de ces jours, tu voudras bien que je te le montre, dis ?","“I called him Mathieu, because he looks like that big man who brings the letters; he's become pretty strong... You're not kind to always refuse to see him. One of these days, would you like me to show it to you, say?","‘I’ve called him Matthew, because he looks like that fat man who delivers the letters; he’s grown so strong...

It is very unkind of you to refuse to come and look at it as you always do. You will come to see it some day, won't you?'"
"Puis, au bout d’un silence, désolé de la voir bouder, voulant qu’elle le caressât encore, il ouvrit enfin les lèvres, il demanda :","Then, after a silence, sorry to see her sulk, wanting her to caress him again, he finally opened his lips and asked:","Then, after a silence, sad to see her sulking, and wanting her to caress him again, he at last opened his mouth and asked:","Then after a short silence, grieved to see her pouting, and longing for a renewal of her caresses, he opened his lips and asked: 'Where is it?'"
"— Mais, finit-il par dire, avec quoi le feras-tu cuire, ton poisson ? Il n’y a pas de bois.","""But,"" he said at last, ""with what will you cook your fish?"" There is no wood.","‘But what are you going to cook it with, this fish of yours?’ he finally asked. ‘There isn’t any wood.’","'But,' he ended by asking, 'how are we going to cook your fish when you have caught it?

"— Tu leur donnerais un chrétien, continua-t-elle, qu’elles en viendraient à bout… Et dures au mal ! Elles vivent très bien avec un membre cassé.","""You would give them a Christian,"" she continued, ""that they would overcome it... And hard on evil!"" They live very well with a broken limb.","‘If you gave them a human being,’ she went on, ‘they would soon finish him off... And they’re so hardy about pain! They carry on quite well, even with a broken limb.","'You might give them a human being,' she continued, 'they'd finish him. And aren't they tough livers! They get on with a broken limb even."
"— Dites, j’ai un nid de merles, le voulez-vous ? demanda Albine au docteur.","""Say, I have a nest of blackbirds, do you want it?"" Albine asked the doctor.","‘By the way, I’ve got a nest of blackbirds, do you want it?’ Albine asked the doctor.","'I say, I have got some blackbird nestlings; would you like them?'

"— Alors, père Jeanbernat, vous êtes un matérialiste ? demanda-t-il.","""So, Father Jeanbernat, are you a materialist?"" he asked.","‘So, Jeanbernat, you’re a materialist?’ he asked.","So you are a materialist, Jeanbernat?' he said."
"Et la voyant hausser les épaules d’un air las, il ajouta comme pour se moquer d’elle :","And seeing her shrug her shoulders wearily, he added as if to make fun of her:","And on seeing her wearily shrugging her shoulders, he added, just to tease her:","And when he saw Albine shrug her shoulders with a weary air, he added, in a teasing kind of way, 'You have got tired of looking for your tree, then?'"
"— Là, là, nous y sommes, dit-elle, en lui donnant de petites claques sur les joues.","""There, there we are,"" she said, slapping him on the cheek.","‘Well now, we’re there!’ she said, slapping him gently on the cheeks.","'Here—here we are,' she said at last, tapping him gently on the cheeks."
— Monsieur le curé ! Frère Archangias ! appela la Teuse. Vite ! La soupe est servie.,- Mister the preist ! Brother Archangias! called La Teuse. Quick ! The soup is served.,"‘Monsieur le Curé! Brother Archangias!’ La Teuse called out. ‘ Come quickly, the soup is on the table.’",'Monsieur le Cure! Brother Archangias!' cried La Teuse. ' Come quick! The soup is on the table.'
"Serge n’ouvrit pas les lèvres. Lorsqu’ils revinrent, ils descendirent l’allée, ils tournèrent les gros marronniers, ils entrèrent sous les tilleuls. C’était un chemin d’amour. Sur l’herbe, ils semblaient chercher des pas, un nœud de ruban tombé, une bouffée de parfum ancien, quelque indice qui leur montrât clairement qu’ils étaient bien dans le sentier menant à la joie d’être ensemble. La nuit venait, le parc avait une grande voix mourante qui les appelait du fond des verdures.","Serge did not open his lips. When they came back, they went down the path, they turned the big chestnut trees, they entered under the lime trees. It was a path of love. On the grass, they seemed to be looking for footsteps, a fallen ribbon knot, a whiff of old perfume, some clue that would clearly show them that they were on the path to the joy of being together. Night was coming, the park had a great dying voice calling them from the depths of the greenery.","Serge did not say a word. When they went back, they too went down that path, round the big chestnut trees, and on under the lime trees. It was a path of love. As they walked on the grass, they seemed to be looking for footsteps, a bit of stray ribbon, a whiff of perfume from long ago, some sign that they were indeed on the path that led to the bliss of being together. Night was coming, and the park now had a mighty dying voice that called to them from the depths of the greenery.","Serge made no reply. But as they went home, they took the path which Albine had pointed out, past the chestnuts and under the limes. It was a path that love had consecrated. And as they walked over the grass, they seemed to be seeking footmarks, or a fallen knot of ribbon, or a whiff of ancient perfume—something that would clearly satisfy them that they were really travelling along the path that led to the joy of union."
"— Est-ce fini, cette fois ?… Moi, quand j’avais votre âge, j’étais possédé ; un démon me mangeait les reins. Et puis, il s’est ennuyé, il s’en est allé. Je n’ai plus de reins. Je vis tranquille… Oh ! je savais bien que vous viendriez. Voilà trois semaines que je vous guette. Je regardais dans le jardin, par le trou du mur. J’aurais voulu couper les arbres. Souvent, j’ai jeté des pierres. Quand je cassais une branche, j’étais content… Dites, c’est donc extraordinaire, ce qu’on goûte là-dedans ?","“Is it over this time?… Me, when I was your age, I was possessed; a demon was eating my kidneys. And then, he got bored, he left. I have no more kidneys. I live peacefully… Oh! I knew you would come. I've been watching you for three weeks. I looked into the garden, through the hole in the wall. I wanted to cut the trees. Often I threw stones. When I broke a branch, I was happy... Tell me, is it extraordinary, what do you taste in there?","‘Is it all over, this time?... I myself, when I was your age, was possessed; a demon gnawed at my loins. And then he got bored and went away. I don’t have loins any more. I live in peace... Oh! I knew you would come. I’ve been watching out for you for three weeks now. I could see into the garden through the hole in the wall. I would have liked to cut down the trees. Often I threw stones. When I broke one of the branches, I was happy... So, tell me, is it so extraordinary then, what you enjoy in there?’","'Is it all over this time?' he asked. ' When I was your age I was possessed too. A demon was ever gnawing at me. But, after a time, he grew weary of it, and took himself off. Now that he has gone I live quietly enough. . . . Oh! I knew very well that you would go. For three weeks past I have been keeping watch upon you. I used to look into the garden through the breach in the wall. I should have liked to cut the trees down. I have often hurled stones at them; it was delightful to break the branches. Tell me, now, is it so very nice to be there?'"
"Ils étaient dans l’ancien verger du parc. Une haie vive d’aubépine, une muraille de verdure, trouée de brèches, mettait là un bout de jardin à part. C’était une forêt d’arbres fruitiers, que la serpe n’avait pas taillés depuis un siècle. Certains troncs se déjetaient puissamment, poussaient de travers, sous les coups d’orage qui les avaient pliés ; tandis que d’autres, bossués de nœuds énormes, crevassés de cavités profondes, ne semblaient plus tenir au sol que par les ruines géantes de leur écorce. Les hautes branches, que le poids des fruits courbait à chaque saison, étendaient au loin des raquettes démesurées ; même, les plus chargées, qui avaient cassé, touchaient la terre, sans qu’elles eussent cessé de produire, raccommodées par d’épais bourrelets de sève. Entre eux, les arbres se prêtaient des étais naturels, n’étaient plus que des piliers tordus, soutenant une voûte de feuilles qui se creusait en longues galeries, s’élançait brusquement en halles légères, s’aplatissait presque au ras du sol en soupentes effondrées. Autour de chaque colosse, des rejets sauvages faisaient des taillis, ajoutaient l’emmêlement de leurs jeunes tiges, dont les petites baies avaient une aigreur exquise. Dans le jour verdâtre, qui coulait comme une eau claire, dans le grand silence de la mousse, retentissait seule la chute sourde des fruits que le vent cueillait.","They were in the old orchard in the park. A quick hawthorn hedge, a wall of greenery, riddled with breaches, set a bit of garden apart. It was a forest of fruit trees, which the sickle had not pruned for a century. Certain trunks twisted powerfully, pushed sideways under the blows of the storm which had bent them; while others, bulging with enormous knots, cracked with deep cavities, seemed to hold on to the ground only by the giant ruins of their bark. The high branches, which the weight of the fruits bent in each season, stretched out disproportionate rackets in the distance; even the heaviest, which had broken, touched the ground, without ceasing to produce, mended by thick beads of sap. Between them, the trees lent themselves natural props, were no more than twisted pillars, supporting a vault of leaves which hollowed out in long galleries, soared suddenly in light halls, flattened almost at ground level in lofts. collapsed. Around each colossus, wild shoots made thickets, adding the tangle of their young stems, whose little berries had an exquisite sourness. In the greenish day, which flowed like clear water, in the great silence of the moss, only the dull fall of the fruits that the wind picked up resounded.","They were in the former orchard of the park. A hawthorn hedge, a wall of greenery, with some gaps in it, cut it off from the rest of the garden. It was a forest of fruit trees that no scythe had trimmed for a century. Some, twisted out of shape, battered and bent by storms, were growing quite askew; while others, covered with enormous lumpy knots and deep holes, seemed only to hold to the ground by the huge remnants of their bark. The high branches, weighed down with fruit each season, spread out their vast sprays far and wide, while some, the most heavily laden, had even broken and now rested on the ground, while still continuing to bear fruit, sustained by their rich reserves of sap. The trees were propping each other up; they had become twisted pillars, holding up a vaulted roof of leaves that plunged into long arcades, soared suddenly into airy halls, and flattened out almost along the ground, like collapsed rafters. Around each of these giants, wild offshoots formed a thicket, adding the dense tangle of young stalks, whose berries had a delicious sharpness. In the greenish light that flowed like clear running water over the great silence of the moss, the only sound that could be heard was the thud of fruit being gathered by the wind.","They were in the old orchard of the park. A hawthorn hedge, a real wall of greenery with here and there a gap, separated it from everything else. There was quite a forest of fruit trees, which no pruning knife had touched for a century past. Some of the trees had been strangely warped and twisted by the storms which had raged over them; while others, bossed all over with huge knots and full of deep holes, seemed only to hold on to the soil with their bark. The high branches, bent each year by weight of fruit, stretched out like big rackets; and each tree helped to keep its fellows erect. The trunks were like twisted pillars supporting a roof of greenery; and sometimes narrow cloisters, sometimes light halls were formed, while now and again the verdure swept almost to the ground and left scarcely room to pass. Round each colossus a crowd of wild and self-sown saplings had grown up, thicket-like with the entanglement of their young shoots. In the greenish light which filtered like tinted water through the foliage, in the deep silence of the mossy soil, one only heard the dull thud of the fruit as it was culled by the wind."
"Et elle glissa à un sommeil profond. Les bêtes avaient fini par monter sur elle. C’était un flot de plumes vivantes qui la couvrait. Des poules semblaient couver ses pieds. Les oies mettaient le duvet de leur cou le long de ses cuisses. À gauche, le cochon lui chauffait le flanc ; pendant que la chèvre, à droite, allongeait sa tête barbue jusque sous son aisselle. Un peu partout, des pigeons nichaient, dans ses mains ouvertes, au creux de sa taille, derrière ses épaules tombantes. Et elle était toute rose, en dormant, caressée par le souffle plus fort de la vache, étouffée sous le poids du grand coq accroupi, qui était descendu plus bas que la gorge, les ailes battantes, la crête allumée, et dont le ventre fauve la brûlait d’une caresse de flamme, à travers ses jupes.","And she slipped into a deep sleep. The beasts had finally climbed on top of her. It was a flood of living feathers that covered her. Chickens seemed to be brooding over her feet. The geese put the down of their necks along his thighs. On the left, the pig warmed his side; while the goat, on the right, extended its bearded head to its armpit. A little everywhere, pigeons were nesting, in his open hands, in the hollow of his waist, behind his drooping shoulders. And she was quite rosy as she slept, caressed by the stronger breath of the cow, suffocated under the weight of the great crouching rooster, which had descended below the throat, its flapping wings, its burning crest, and whose tawny belly burned her with a caress of flame through her skirts.","And she slipped into a deep sleep. The animals had ended up climbing all over her. She was covered by a living flood of feathers. Hens seemed to be brooding on her feet. Geese laid the down of their necks upon her thighs. On the left, the rooster was keeping her side warm, while the goat, on the right, stretched out his bearded head right up to her armpit. And more or less everywhere there were pigeons perching, on her open hands, in the dent of her waist, and behind her drooping shoulders. And she was all pink as she slept, caressed by the cow’s stronger breath, and smothered by the weight of the rooster, who had moved down below her breast, with flapping wings and crest blazing, his tawny belly burning her through her skirts with a caress of flame.","Then she sank into deep slumber. The fowls had ended by perching on her body; she was buried beneath a wave of living plumage. Hens were brooding over her feet; geese stretched their soft downy necks over her legs. The pig lay against her left side, while on the right, the goat poked its bearded head under her arm. The pigeons were roosting and nestling all over her, on her hands, her waist, and her shoulders. And there she lay asleep, in all her rosy freshness, caressed by the cow's warm breath, while the big cock still squatted just below her bosom with gleaming comb and quivering wings."
"Un matin, Albine trouva Serge debout. Il avait déjà réussi à ouvrir un volet. Il s’essayait à marcher, sans s’appuyer aux meubles.","One morning, Albine found Serge up. He had already managed to open a shutter. He was trying to walk, without leaning on the furniture.","At last, one morning, she found Serge standing up.

"— Alors, c’est fini, tu me chasses ?… Je suis ta femme pourtant. C’est toi qui m’as faite. Dieu, après avoir permis cela, ne peut nous punir à ce point.","""So it's over, you're driving me away?... I'm your wife though."" It was you who made me. God, having allowed this, cannot punish us to this extent.","‘So this is the end, and you’re driving me away?... And yet I am your wife.

"— Entrez aussi, vous autres, dit-il en se tournant.","""Come in too, you guys,"" he said, turning.","‘Come on in, you others,’ said Brother Archangias, turning round.","'Come in, too, you others,' he exclaimed, turning round."
"Elle n’avait point la fièvre, elle voulait rentrer tout de suite, pour que personne ne pût rire, en la regardant. Et, hâtant le pas de plus en plus, elle cueillait, le long des haies, des verdures dont elle cachait sa nudité. Elle noua sur ses cheveux un rameau de mûrier ; elle s’enroula aux bras des liserons, qu’elle attacha à ses poignets ; elle se mit au cou un collier, fait de brins de viorne, si longs, qu’ils couvraient sa poitrine d’un voile de feuilles.","She had no fever, she wanted to go home at once, so that no one could laugh while looking at her. And, hastening her step more and more, she gathered, along the hedges, greenery with which she hid her nudity. She tied a branch of mulberry to her hair; she wrapped herself in the arms of the bindweeds, which she tied to her wrists; she put a necklace around her neck, made of sprigs of viburnum, so long that they covered her chest with a veil of leaves.","She did not have a fever, she wanted to go home straight away, so that nobody could look at her and laugh at her. And walking faster and faster, she was gathering bits of greenery from the hedges, to cover her nakedness. She knotted her hair round a mulberry twig; she wrapped her arms in convolvulus that she fastened to her wrists; she hung round her neck a necklace of clematis stems, so long that they covered her breast with a veil of leaves.","She had no fever at all, she said, but she wanted to get back as quickly as possible, so that no one might laugh at her. And, ever increasing her pace, she plucked handfuls of leaves and tendrils from the hedges, which she entwined about her. She fastened a branch of mulberry over her hair, twisted bindweed round her arms, and tied it to her wrists, and circled her neck with such long sprays of laurustinus, that her bosom was hidden as by a veil of leaves."
"Le soir, pourtant, l’abbé Mouret se sentit trop las. Il remit son départ au lendemain. Le lendemain, il se donna un nouveau prétexte : il ne pouvait abandonner sa sœur ainsi seule avec la Teuse ; il laisserait une lettre pour qu’on la conduisît chez l’oncle Pascal. Pendant trois jours, il se promit d’écrire cette lettre ; la feuille de papier, la plume et l’encre étaient prêtes, sur la table, dans sa chambre. Et, le troisième jour, il s’en alla, sans écrire la lettre. Tout d’un coup, il avait pris son chapeau, il était parti pour le Paradou, par bêtise, obsédé, se résignant, allant là comme à une corvée qu’il ne savait de quelle façon éviter. L’image d’Albine s’était encore effacée ; il ne la voyait plus, il obéissait à d’anciennes volontés, mortes en lui à cette heure, mais dont la poussée persistait dans le grand silence de son être.","In the evening, however, Father Mouret felt too tired. He postponed his departure until the following day. The next day he gave himself a new pretext: he could not leave his sister thus alone with La Teuse; he would leave a letter to be taken to Uncle Pascal. For three days he promised himself to write this letter; the sheet of paper, the pen and the ink were ready, on the table, in his room. And on the third day he went away without writing the letter. All of a sudden, he had taken his hat, he had left for Paradou, out of stupidity, obsessed, resigning himself, going there like a chore he didn't know how to avoid. Albine's image had faded again; he no longer saw her, he was obeying old wills, dead within him at that moment, but whose thrust persisted in the great silence of his being.","However, when evening came, Abbé Mouret felt too weary. He put off his departure to the next day.

For three days he promised himself he would write that letter; the sheet of paper, the pen and ink were ready on the table in his bedroom. And on the third day he went off without writing the letter. He had suddenly taken his hat and set off for the Paradou, out of stupidity, just obsessed and resigning himself to it, going there as if for some chore he could find no way of avoiding. The image of Albine had grown even fainter; he could not see her any more, he was acting in obedience to old resolves, now dead for him, but whose impetus still persisted in the great silence of his being.","But when the evening came, he felt too weary. So he deferred his flight till the next morning. And the next morning he made a fresh pretext for delay. He could not leave his sister alone with La Teuse. He would prepare a letter, directing that she should be taken to her uncle Pascal's. For three days he was ever on the point of writing that letter, and the paper and pen and ink were lying ready on the table in his room. Then, on the third day, he went off, leaving the letter unwritten. He took up his hat quite suddenly and set off for the Paradou in a state of mingled stupor and resignation, as though he were unwillingly performing some compulsory task which he saw no means of avoiding. Albine's image was now effaced from his memory; he no longer beheld her, but he was driven on by old resolves whose lingering influence, though they themselves were dead, still worked upon him in his silence and loneliness."

— Bataille ! cria-t-elle avec une émotion extraordinaire.,- Battle ! she cried with extraordinary emotion.,"‘War!’ cried La Teuse, with unusual vehemence.","'Here's a battle!' she cried, wild with excitement."

"Le Frère, en silence, rampa jusqu’au tas de cailloux. Il attendit que le vieux fût à quelque distance. Puis, à deux mains, il recommença, furieusement.

Jeanbernat, ne daignant plus se fâcher, s’en allait, droit comme un arbre, au fond de la nuit sereine.","The Brother silently crawled to the pile of stones. He waited until the old man was some distance away. Then, with both hands, he started again, furiously. But the stones were rolling in the dust of the road.

"Et il partit en courant, son rabat sale volant sur l’épaule, sa grande soutane graisseuse arrachant les chardons. L’abbé Mouret le regarda tomber au milieu de la bande des enfants, qui se sauvèrent comme un vol de moineaux effarouchés. Mais il avait réussi à saisir par les oreilles Catherine et un autre gamin. Il les ramena du côté du village, les tenant ferme de ses gros doigts velus, les accablant d’injures.","And he ran off, his dirty flap flying over his shoulder, his big greasy cassock ripping up the thistles.

"Les grandes filles posaient leurs rameaux sur l’autel, qu’elles baisaient. Elles restaient un instant contre la nappe, passant les branches à la Teuse, oubliant l’air sournoisement recueilli qu’elles avaient pris pour monter le degré ; elles finissaient par rire, elles butaient des genoux, ployaient les hanches au bord de la table, enfonçaient la gorge en plein dans le tabernacle.

They remained for a moment against the tablecloth, passing the branches to the Teuse, forgetting the slyly collected air they had assumed to climb the step; they ended up laughing, they stumbled with their knees, bent their hips over the edge of the table, thrust their throats right into the tabernacle. And, above them, the great Virgin of gilded plaster bent her painted face, smiled with her rosy lips at the naked baby Jesus whom she carried on her left arm.","The girls kissed the altar as they laid their branches upon it.

And above their heads, the big Virgin, in gilded plaster, bent her painted face and smiled with her pink lips at the naked little Jesus she carried on her left arm.","The big girls laid their branches on the altar, which they kissed; and there they lingered for a while, handing up the greenery to La Teuse. The sly look of devotion they had assumed on stepping on to the altar steps was quickly set aside, and soon they were laughing, digging each other with their knees, swaying their hips against the altar's edge, and thrusting their bosoms against the tabernacle itself. Over them the tall Virgin in gilded plaster bent her tinted face, and smiled with her rosy lips upon the naked Jesus she bore upon her left arm."

"— Une drôle de gamine ! disait l’oncle Pascal, en lâchant un peu les guides. Elle avait neuf ans, lorsqu’elle est tombée chez ce païen. Un frère à lui, qui s’est ruiné, je ne sais plus dans quoi. La petite se trouvait en pension quelque part, quand le père s’est tué. C’était même une demoiselle, savante déjà, lisant, brodant, bavardant, tapant sur les pianos. Et coquette donc ! Je l’ai vue arriver, avec des bas à jour, des jupes brodées, des guimpes, des manchettes, un tas de falbalas… Ah bien ! Les falbalas ont duré longtemps !","- A funny kid! said Uncle Pascal, letting go of the guides a little. She was nine years old when she fell to this pagan.

I saw her arrive, with openwork stockings, embroidered skirts, wimples, cuffs, a heap of furbelows… Ah well! The frills lasted a long time!","‘Such an odd girl!’ said Uncle Pascal, relaxing his grip on the reins.’ She was nine years old when she landed on this pagan fellow. It was one of his brothers who lost all his money in something, I don’t know what. The little girl was at boarding school somewhere when her father killed himself. She was quite an educated young lady already, reading and embroidering, chatting nicely and playing the piano a little. And such a coquette! I saw her when she arrived here, with lacy stockings, embroidered skirts, little lace blouses and cuffs, a heap of frills and flounces... Ah well, the frills and flounces didn’t last very long!’","'A queer girl!' said his uncle as he eased the reins a little. ' She was nine years old when she took up her quarters with that old heathen. Some brother of his had ruined himself, though in what I can't remember. The little one was at school somewhere when her father killed himself. She was even quite a little lady, up to reading, embroidery, chattering, and strumming on the piano. And such a coquette too! I saw her arrive with open-worked stockings, embroidered skirts, frills, cuffs, a heap of finery. Ah, well! the finery didn't last long!'"
— Monte donc sur mon dos.,- Get on my back.,"‘Come on, get on my back.’","'Get on to my back,' repeated Serge."
"Puis, au bout d’une semaine, Albine ne resta plus que quelques minutes. Elle paraissait l’éviter. Elle arrivait, toute soucieuse, se tenait debout, avait hâte de sortir. Quand il l’interrogeait, lui reprochant de n’être plus son amie, elle détournait la tête, pour ne pas avoir à répondre. Jamais elle ne voulait lui conter l’emploi des matinées qu’elle vivait loin de lui. Elle secouait la tête d’un air gêné, parlait de sa paresse. S’il la pressait davantage, elle se retirait d’un bond, lui jetait le soir un simple adieu au travers de la porte. Cependant, lui, voyait bien qu’elle devait pleurer souvent. Il suivait sur son visage les phases d’un espoir toujours déçu, la continuelle révolte d’un désir acharné à se satisfaire. Certains jours, elle était mortellement triste, la face découragée, avec une marche lente qui hésitait à tenter plus longtemps la joie de vivre. D’autres jours, elle avait des rires contenus, la figure rayonnante d’une pensée de triomphe, dont elle ne voulait pas parler encore, les pieds inquiets, ne pouvant tenir en place, ayant hâte de courir à une dernière certitude. Et, le lendemain, elle retombait à ses désolations, pour se remettre à espérer le jour suivant. Mais ce qu’il lui devint bientôt impossible de cacher, ce fut une immense fatigue, une lassitude qui lui brisait les membres. Même aux instants de confiance, elle fléchissait, elle glissait au sommeil, les yeux ouverts.","Then, after a week, Albine only stayed a few minutes. She seemed to avoid him. She arrived, all worried, stood up, in a hurry to go out. When he questioned her, reproaching her for no longer being his friend, she turned her head away so as not to have to answer. She never wanted to tell him about the use of the mornings she lived away from him. She shook her head embarrassed, talking about her laziness. If he pressed her any further, she would jump out of the way, and throw him a simple farewell in the evening through the door. However, he saw that she had to cry often. He followed on his face the phases of a hope always disappointed, the continual revolt of a relentless desire to be satisfied. Some days she was deadly sad, with a discouraged face, with a slow walk that hesitated to attempt the joy of living any longer. On other days, she would stifle laughter, her face radiant with a thought of triumph, of which she did not want to speak yet, her feet restless, unable to hold her place, eager to run to a final certainty. And, the next day, she fell back into her desolation, to hope again for the following day. But what it soon became impossible for him to hide was an immense fatigue, a weariness that broke his limbs. Even in moments of confidence, she gave way, she slipped into sleep, her eyes open.","Then after a week, Albine would only stay for a few minutes. She seemed to be avoiding him. She would arrive with a worried expression, would not sit down, and was in a hurry to leave. When he questioned her, reproaching her for seeming no longer to be his friend, she would turn her head away to avoid answering him. She never told him anything about how she spent her mornings apart from him. She just shook her head with an embarrassed air and said she was lazy. If he insisted, she would rush away, with nothing more than a quick goodbye from the doorway. He, however, could see perfectly well that she must be crying a good deal. He followed, on her face, the different phases of a hope constantly disappointed, and the continual rebellion of a desire determined to find satisfaction. Some days she was mortally sad, with her face full of despair and her step slow, as if reluctant now even to attempt any joy in life. On other days, she was full of suppressed laughter, her face radiant, as if thinking of a triumph she did not yet want to explain, and her feet restless, unable to stay in one place, in a hurry to rush to some final certainty. And the next day she would fall back into her desolation, only to return to hopefulness the day after. But what it soon became impossible to hide was her terrible tiredness, a weariness that seemed to crush her body. Even in her confident moods, she would falter, and fall asleep with her eyes open.","Then, after a week had gone by, Albine's visit never lasted more than a few minutes. She seemed to shun him. When she came to the room, she appeared thoughtful, remained standing, and hurried off as soon as possible. When he questioned her about this change in her demeanour towards him, and reproached her for no longer being friendly, she turned her head away and avoided replying. He never could get her to tell him how she spent the mornings that she passed alone. She would only shake her head, and talk about being very idle. If he pressed her more closely, she bounded out of the room, just wishing him a hasty good-night as she disappeared through the doorway. He often noticed, however, that she had been crying. He observed, too, in her expression the phases of a hope that was never fulfilled, the perpetual struggling of a desire eager to be satisfied. Sometimes she seemed quite overwhelmed with melancholy, dragging herself about with an air of utter discouragement, like one who no longer had any pleasure in living. At other times she laughed lightly, her face shone with an expression of triumphant hope, of which, however, she would not yet speak, and her feet could not remain still, so eager was she to dart away to what seemed to her some last certainty. But on the following day, she would sink again into desperation, to soar afresh on the morrow on the pinions of renewed hope. One thing which she could not conceal from Serge was that she suffered from extreme lassitude. Even during the few moments they spent together she could not prevent her head from nodding, or keep herself from dozing off."
"Cela le laissait d’être un cygne, une blancheur, et de nager sans fin sur le lac limpide du ciel. Il en arrivait à souhaiter un vol de nuages noirs, quelque écroulement de nuées qui rompît la monotonie de cette grande pureté. À mesure que la santé revenait, il avait des besoins de sensations plus fortes. Maintenant, il passait des heures à regarder la branche verte ; il aurait voulu la voir pousser, la voir s’épanouir, lui jeter des rameaux jusque dans son lit. Elle ne lui suffisait plus, elle ne faisait qu’irriter ses désirs, en lui parlant de ces arbres dont il entendait les appels profonds, sans qu’il pût en apercevoir les cimes. C’étaient un chuchotement infini de feuilles, un bavardage d’eaux courantes, des battements d’ailes, toute une voix haute, prolongée, vibrante.","That left him to be a swan, a whiteness, and to swim endlessly on the limpid lake of the sky. He came to wish for a flight of black clouds, some collapse of clouds which would break the monotony of this great purity. As his health returned, he needed more thrills. Now he spent hours looking at the green branch; he would have liked to see it grow, to see it bloom, to throw branches into his bed. She was no longer enough for him, she only irritated his desires, by speaking to him of those trees whose deep appeals he heard, without his being able to perceive their tops. It was an endless whispering of leaves, a chatter of running waters, flapping of wings, a whole high, prolonged, vibrating voice.","He was growing weary of being a swan, a whiteness, forever swimming on the limpid lake of the sky. He even found himself wishing for a flight of black clouds, a tumbling down of clouds that would break the monotony of all that purity. As his health improved, he felt the need for stronger sensations. He now spent hours looking at the green branch; he would have liked to see it grow, flourish, and thrust its boughs right up to his bed. It was no longer enough for him, it only aggravated his desires, speaking to him of other trees, those he could hear calling him, though he could not see their tops. There was an endless whispering of leaves, chattering of running water, and flappings of wings, making one high, long-drawn-out, and vibrant voice.","He grew weary of being white and swanlike, of ever swimming on heaven's limpid lake. He came to wish for a pack of black clouds, some crumbling of the skies, that would break upon the monotony of all that purity. And as his health returned, he hungered for keener sensations. He now spent hours in gazing at the verdant bough: he would have liked to see it grow, expand, and throw out its branches to his very bed. It no longer satisfied him, but only roused desires, speaking to him as it did of all the trees whose deep-sounding call he could hear although their crests were hidden from his sight. An endless whispering of leaves, a chattering as of running water, a fluttering as of wings, all blended in one mighty, long-drawn, quivering voice, resounded in his ears."

"Elle voulait parler d’une Cybèle[28] allongée sur des gerbes, œuvre d’un élève de Puget[29], sculptée au fronton du marché. L’abbé Mouret, sans répondre, la poussa doucement hors du salon, en lui recommandant de faire le moins de bruit possible. Et, jusqu’au soir, le presbytère resta dans un grand silence. La Teuse achevait sa lessive, sous le hangar. Le prêtre, au fond de l’étroit jardin, son bréviaire tombé sur les genoux, était abîmé dans une contemplation pieuse, pendant que des pétales roses pleuvaient des pêchers en fleurs.","She meant a Cybèle[28] reclining on sheaves, the work of a pupil of Puget[29], sculpted on the pediment of the market. Abbé Mouret, without answering, pushed her gently out of the drawing-room, advising her to make as little noise as possible. And, until evening, the presbytery remained in great silence. La Teuse was finishing her laundry, under the shed. The priest, at the bottom of the narrow garden, his breviary fallen on his knees, was absorbed in pious contemplation, while pink petals rained down from the peach trees in blossom.","She was referring to the sculpture of a Cybele* stretched out on sheaves of corn, on the pediment of the market wall, the work of a student of Puget. * Without answering, Abbé Mouret gently pushed her out of the room, telling her to make as little noise as possible. And until the evening, total silence reigned in the presbytery. La Teuse was finishing off the washing soap out in the shed. The priest, at the bottom of the narrow garden, with his breviary fallen on his knees, was sunk in devout meditation, while pink petals rained down from the peach trees in bloom.","She spoke thus of a Cybele stretched upon sheaves of wheat, the work of one of Puget's pupils, which was carved on the frontal of the market building. Without replying, however, Abbe Mouret gently pushed her out of the room, and begged her to make as little noise as possible. Till evening, therefore, perfect silence settled on the parsonage. La Teuse finished her washing in the shed. The priest, seated at the bottom of the little garden, his breviary fallen on his lap, remained absorbed in pious thoughts, while all around him rosy petals rained from the blossoming peach-trees."
"— Attendez, les cordons de vos souliers ne sont seulement pas noués… Je ne sais pas comment vos pieds résistent, dans ces souliers de paysan.

"C’était la fin, les actions de grâce rendues à Dieu. Le servant alla chercher une dernière fois le Missel, le rapporta à droite. Le prêtre remit sur le calice le purificatoire, la patène, la pale ; puis, il pinça de nouveau les deux larges plis du voile, et posa la bourse, dans laquelle il avait plié le corporal. Tout son être était un ardent remerciement. Il demandait au ciel la rémission de ses péchés, la grâce d’une sainte vie, le mérite de la vie éternelle. Il restait abîmé dans ce miracle d’amour, dans cette immolation continue qui le nourrissait chaque jour du sang et de la chair de son Sauveur.","It was the end, thanksgiving to God. The servant fetched the Missal one last time, brought it back to the right. The priest replaced the chalice with the purificator, the paten, the pale; then he pinched the two wide folds of the veil again, and put down the purse in which he had folded the corporal. His whole being was an ardent thank you. He asked heaven for the remission of his sins, the grace of a holy life, the merit of eternal life. He remained absorbed in this miracle of love, in this continuous immolation which nourished him each day with the blood and the flesh of his Saviour.","This was the end, the act of thanksgiving to God. The server went one last time to get the Missal and bring it back to the right-hand side. The priest replaced the purificator, the paten, and the pall on the chalice; then once more he pinched together the two wide folds of the veil, and put down the burse, in which he had folded the corporal. His whole being expressed ardent thanksgiving. He was asking Heaven for the remission of his sins, for the grace of a holy life, and to be worthy of life everlasting. He remained lost in this miracle of love, this perpetual immolation which nourished him every day with the body and blood of his Saviour.","Then came the end, the act of thanksgiving to God. For the last time the server removed the Missal, and brought it back to the right-hand side.

He remained as if overwhelmed by this miracle of love, the ever-recurring immolation, which sustained him day by day with the blood and flesh of his Savior."
"— Elle était si contente de vous soigner, continua le vieux. En fumant ma pipe, je l’entendais rire. Ça me suffisait. Les filles, c’est comme les aubépines : quand elles font des fleurs, elles font tout ce qu’elles peuvent… Enfin, vous viendrez, si le cœur vous en dit. Peut-être que ça amuserait la petite. Bonsoir, curé.","""She was so happy to take care of you,"" continued the old man. While smoking my pipe, I heard him laugh. That was enough for me. Girls are like hawthorns: when they bloom, they do everything they can… Finally, you will come, if you feel like it. Maybe that would amuse the little one. Hello, priest.","‘She was so happy, looking after you!’ the old man went on. ‘As I smoked my pipe, I could hear her laughing. That was enough for me. Girls are like the hawthorn: when they flower, they flower abundantly... Anyway, you’ll come if you feel like it... Perhaps that would cheer the child up... Good evening, priest.’","'It made her so happy to look after you,' continued the old man. ' While I smoked my pipe I used to hear her laugh. That was quite sufficient for me. Girls are like the hawthorns; when they break out into blossom, they do all they can. Well, now, you will come, if your heart prompts you to it. I am sure it would please the little one. Good night, Cure.'"
"— Elle est futée, la mère !… Dame ! puisque le curé veut du monde dans son église !","- She is smart, the mother! ... Lady! since the priest wants people in his church!","‘She’s a canny one, that mother of mine!...

"Cependant, à cette heure, le parc entier était à eux. Ils en avaient pris possession, souverainement. Pas un coin de terre qui ne leur appartint. C’était pour eux que le bois de roses fleurissait, que le parterre avait des odeurs douces, alanguies, dont les bouffées les endormaient, la nuit, par leurs fenêtres ouvertes. Le verger les nourrissait, emplissait de fruits les jupes d’Albine, les rafraîchissait de l’ombre musquée de ses branches, sous lesquelles il faisait si bon déjeuner, après le lever du soleil. Dans les prairies, ils avaient les herbes et les eaux : les herbes qui élargissaient indéfiniment leur royaume, en déroulant sans cesse devant eux des tapis de soie ; les eaux qui étaient la meilleure de leurs joies, leur grande pureté, leur grande innocence, le ruissellement de fraîcheur où ils aimaient à tremper leur jeunesse. Ils possédaient la forêt, depuis les chênes énormes que dix hommes n’auraient pu embrasser, jusqu’aux bouleaux minces qu’un enfant aurait cassé d’un effort ; la forêt avec tous ses arbres, toute son ombre, ses avenues, ses clairières, ses trous de verdure, inconnus aux oiseaux eux-mêmes ; la forêt dont ils disposaient à leur guise, comme d’une tente géante, pour y abriter, à l’heure de midi, leur tendresse née du matin. Ils régnaient partout, même sur les rochers, sur les sources, sur ce sol terrible, aux plantes monstrueuses, qui avait tressailli sous le poids de leurs corps, et qu’ils aimaient, plus que les autres couches molles du jardin, pour l’étrange frisson qu’ils y avaient goûté. Ainsi, maintenant, en face, à gauche, à droite, ils étaient les maîtres, ils avaient conquis leur domaine, ils marchaient au milieu d’une nature amie, qui les connaissait, les saluant d’un rire au passage, s’offrant à leurs plaisirs, en servante soumise. Et ils jouissaient encore du ciel, du large pan bleu étalé au-dessus de leurs têtes ; les murailles ne l’enfermaient pas, mais il appartenait à leurs yeux, il entrait dans leur bonheur de vivre, le jour avec son soleil triomphant, la nuit avec sa pluie chaude d’étoiles. Il les ravissait à toutes les minutes de la journée, changeant comme une chair vivante, plus blanc au matin qu’une fille à son lever, doré à midi d’un désir de fécondité, pâmé le soir dans la lassitude heureuse de ses tendresses. Jamais il n’avait le même visage. Chaque soir, surtout, il les émerveillait, à l’heure des adieux. Le soleil glissant à l’horizon trouvait toujours un nouveau sourire. Parfois, il s’en allait, au milieu d’une paix sereine, sans un nuage, noyé peu à peu dans un bain d’or. D’autres fois, il éclatait en rayons de pourpre, il crevait sa robe de vapeur, s’échappait en ondées de flammes qui barraient le ciel de queues de comètes gigantesques, dont les chevelures incendiaient les cimes des hautes futaies. Puis, c’étaient, sur des plages de sable rouge, sur des bancs allongés de corail rose, un coucher d’astre attendri, soufflant un à un ses rayons ; ou encore un coucher discret, derrière quelque gros nuage, drapé comme un rideau d’alcôve de soie grise, ne montrant qu’une rougeur de veilleuse, au fond de l’ombre croissante ; ou encore un coucher passionné, des blancheurs renversées, peu à peu saignantes sous le disque embrasé qui les mordait, finissant par rouler avec lui derrière l’horizon, au milieu d’un chaos de membres tordus qui s’écroulait dans de la lumière.","However, at this hour, the entire park was theirs. They had taken possession of it, sovereignly. Not a piece of land that did not belong to them. It was for them that the rosewood bloomed, that the flower bed smelt of sweet, languid odors, the whiffs of which put them to sleep at night through their open windows. The orchard nourished them, filled Albine's skirts with fruit, refreshed them with the musky shade of its branches, under which it was such a good lunch after sunrise. In the meadows they had the grasses and the waters: the grasses which extended their kingdom indefinitely, unrolling unceasingly in front of them carpets of silk; the waters which were the best of their joys, their great purity, their great innocence, the stream of coolness in which they loved to soak their youth. They owned the forest, from the huge oaks that ten men could not embrace, to the slender birches that a child would have snapped; the forest with all its trees, all its shade, its avenues, its clearings, its holes in the greenery, unknown to the birds themselves; the forest they had at their disposal as they pleased, like a giant tent, to shelter there, at noon, their tenderness born in the morning. They reigned everywhere, even over the rocks, over the springs, over this terrible soil, with monstrous plants, which had quivered under the weight of their bodies, and which they loved, more than the other soft layers of the garden, for the strange thrill they had tasted there. So now, opposite, to the left, to the right, they were the masters, they had conquered their domain, they were walking in the midst of a friendly nature, which knew them, greeting them with a laugh as they passed, offering themselves to their pleasures, as a submissive servant. And they were still enjoying the sky, the wide blue patch spread out above their heads; the walls did not enclose him, but he belonged to their eyes, he entered into their happiness of living, by day with its triumphant sun, by night with its warm rain of stars. He delighted them every minute of the day, changing like living flesh, whiter in the morning than a girl on rising, gilded at noon with a desire for fertility, swooning in the evening in the happy lassitude of his affections. He never had the same face. Every evening, especially, he amazed them, at the hour of farewell. The sun slipping on the horizon always found a new smile. Sometimes he went away, in the midst of a serene peace, without a cloud, drowned little by little in a bath of gold. At other times, it burst into rays of purple, it burst its robe of vapor, escaped in waves of flames which barred the sky with the tails of gigantic comets, whose hairs set fire to the tops of the high forests. Then there were, on beaches of red sand, on elongated banks of pink coral, a tender star setting, blowing its rays one by one; or again a discreet setting, behind some big cloud, draped like an alcove curtain of gray silk, showing only the redness of a nightlight, at the bottom of the growing shadow; or again a passionate sunset, spilled whitenesses, little by little bleeding under the fiery disc which bit them, finally rolling with it behind the horizon, in the midst of a chaos of twisted limbs which collapsed in light.","Now, however, the entire park was theirs. They had taken sovereign possession of it. There was not one bit of ground that did not belong to them. It was for them that the roses bloomed, for them that the flower garden produced the sweet and languorous perfumes that blew in through the open windows at night, and lulled them to sleep. The orchard kept them fed, filling Albine’s skirts with fruit, and offering them the refreshing musky shade of its branches, beneath which it was so pleasant to breakfast after sunrise. In the grasslands, they owned both the grass and the streams: the grass that extended their kingdom, endlessly rolling out its silky carpets before them; the streams of water which were like the best of their joys, their great purity and innocence, and the cool flow in which they loved to bathe their youth. They possessed the forest, from the huge oaks, too wide for ten men to clasp in their arms, to the slender birches that a child could easily break; the forest with all its different trees, all its shade, avenues, glades, and hideaways of greenery that even the birds did not know. The forest they could use as they wished, as if it were a gigantic tent, to shelter at midday their love born in the morning. They reigned over everything, even the rocks and the springs, and that dreadful ground, covered with monstrous plants, that had quivered beneath the weight of their bodies, and which they loved more than the other, softer couches of the garden, for the strange thrill they had felt in that place. So, now, in every direction, straight ahead, to left or right, they were the masters, they had conquered their domain, they walked in a natural landscape which was their friend, which knew them and greeted them with a laugh as they went by, offering itself up for their pleasure, like a submissive servant. And they also enjoyed the sky, that wide expanse of blue, spread out above their heads; walls could not enclose it, yet it belonged to their eyes, it was part of their joy in living, by day with its all-conquering sun, and by night with its warm shower of stars. It delighted them at every minute of the day, changing like a living being, whiter in the morning than a young girl just rising from her bed, golden at noon with a desire for fecundity, and swooning in the evening in the happy weariness that follows love. Never was its face the same. Every evening it especially amazed them at the hour of farewell. The sun slipping down to the horizon always found a new smile. Sometimes he departed in serene peacefulness without a cloud, just sinking gradually into a bath of gold. At other times, he burst into streaks of crimson, broke through a robe of mists, and poured out in surging flames, striping the sky with gigantic comets’ tails, whose tresses set aflame the tops of the lofty forest trees. Then there would be a tender sunset on stretches of red sand and long banks of rosy coral, with the sun blowing his rays out one by one; or going to his rest modestly draped behind some large cloud, like the grey silk curtain of an alcove, showing only a glow like that of a night light, deep in the growing darkness; or yet again, there would be a passionate sunset, with all whiteness overthrown, soon bleeding under the bite of that burning disc, then finally rolling away with him beyond the horizon in a chaos of twisted limbs that crumbled away in the light.","Yet now the park was entirely their own. They had taken sovereign possession of it. There was not a corner of it that was not theirs to use as they willed. For them alone the thickets of roses put forth their blossoms, and the parterre exhaled its soft perfume, which lulled them to sleep as they lay at night with their windows open. The orchard provided them with food, filling Albine's skirts with fruits, and spread over them the shade of its perfumed boughs, under which it was so pleasant to breakfast in the early morning. Away in the meadows the grass and the streams were all theirs; the grass, which extended their kingdom to such boundless distance, spreading an endless silky carpet before them; and the streams, which were the best of their joys, emblematic of their own purity and innocence, ever offering them coolness and freshness in which they delighted to bathe their youth. The forest, too, was entirely theirs, from the mighty oaks, which ten men could not have spanned, to the slim birches which a child might have snapped; the forest, with all its trees, all its shade, all its avenues and clearings, its cavities of greenery, of which the very birds themselves were ignorant; the forest which they used as they listed, as if it were a giant canopy, beneath which they might shelter from the noontide heat their new-born love. They reigned everywhere, even among the rocks and the springs, even over that gruesome stretch of ground that teemed with such hideous growth, and which had seemed to sink and give way beneath their feet, but which they loved yet even more than the soft grassy couches of the garden, for the strange thrill of passion they had felt there. Thus, now, in front of them, behind them, to the right of them and to the left, all was theirs. They had gained possession of the whole domain, and they walked through a friendly expanse which knew them, and smiled kindly greetings to them as they passed, devoting itself to their pleasure, like a faithful and submissive servitor. The sky, with its vast canopy of blue overhead, was also theirs to enjoy. The park walls could not enclose it, their eyes could ever revel in its beauty, and it entered into the joy of their life, at daytime with its triumphal sun, at night with its golden rain of stars. At every moment of the day it delighted them afresh, its expression ever varying. In the early morning it was pale as a maiden just risen from her slumber; at noon, it was flushed, radiant as with a longing for fruitfulness, and in the evening it became languid and breathless, as after keen enjoyment. Its countenance was constantly changing. Particularly in the evenings, at the hour of parting, did it delight them. The sun, hastening towards the horizon, ever found a fresh smile. Sometimes he disappeared in the midst of serene calmness, unflecked by a single cloud, sinking gradually beneath a golden sea. At other times he threw out crimson glories, tore his vaporous robe to shreds, and set amidst wavy flames that streaked the skies like the tails of gigantic comets, whose radiant heads lit up the crests of the forest trees. Then, again, extinguishing his rays one by one, he would softly sink to rest on shores of ruddy sand, far-reaching banks of blushing coral; and then, some other night, he would glide away demurely behind a heavy cloud that figured the grey hangings of some alcove, through which the eye could only detect a spark like that of a night-light. Or else he would rush to his couch in a tumult of passion, rolled round with white forms which gradually crimsoned beneath his fiery embraces, and finally disappeared with him below the horizon in a confused chaos of gleaming, struggling limbs."
"La vache, étendue sur la litière, tourna la tête, les suivit de ses gros yeux. Et Désirée prétendait qu’elle avait pour sûr besoin de quelque chose. Peut-être qu’on aurait pu l’aider, pour qu’elle souffrît moins. La Teuse haussait les épaules. Est-ce que les bêtes ne savaient pas faire leurs affaires elles-mêmes ! Il ne fallait pas la tourmenter, voilà tout. Elle se dirigeait enfin vers la sacristie, lorsqu’en repassant devant le hangar, elle jeta un nouveau cri.","The cow, lying on the litter, turned her head, followed them with her big eyes.

La Teuse was at last making her way to the sacristy, when, as she passed the shed, she cried out once more:","Just come and look at her, and tell me what ought to be done.' La Teuse shrugged her shoulders. All that the cow wanted was to be left alone and not bothered. Then she set off towards the vestry, but, as she passed the shed, she raised a fresh cry:"
"— Va, tu es belle ! grondait le vieux. Tu sens l’herbe, à empester… Dirait-on qu’elle a seize ans, cette poupée !","- Come on, you're beautiful! growled the old man. You smell like weed, to stink… Does this doll look like she is sixteen years old!","‘Oh, aren’t you lovely!’ growled the old man. ‘You stink of greenery... would anyone believe she was sixteen — this doll?’","'Ay, you are a beauty!' growled the old man. ' You smell of weeds enough to poison one—would any one think she was sixteen, that doll?'"

"Cependant, Rosalie s’était calmée. Avant de s’en aller, elle demanda à Fortuné s’il avait prié monsieur le curé de venir le soir bénir leur chambre, selon l’usage du pays. Alors, Fortuné courut à la sacristie, traversant la nef à gros coups de talon, comme il aurait traversé un champ. Et il reparut, en criant que le curé viendrait. La Teuse, scandalisée du tapage de ces gens, qui semblaient se croire sur une grande route, tapait légèrement dans ses mains, les poussait vers la porte.","However, Rosalie had calmed down. Before leaving, she asked Fortuné if he had asked the priest to come in the evening to bless their room, according to the custom of the country. Then Fortuné ran to the sacristy, crossing the nave with heavy kicks, as he would have crossed a field. And he reappeared, shouting that the priest would come. La Teuse, scandalized by the uproar of these people, who seemed to believe themselves on a high road, lightly clapped her hands, pushing them towards the door.","Meanwhile, Rosalie had calmed down.

La Teuse, outraged at the noise these people were making, behaving as if they were out on the road, gently clapped her hands and pushed them towards the door.","Meanwhile, Rosalie had grown calm again. Before leaving the church, she asked Fortune if he had begged the priest to come and bless their room, according to the custom of the country. So Fortune ran off to the vestry, striding heavily through the church, as if it were a field. He soon reappeared, shouting that his reverence would come. La Teuse, who was scandalised at the noise made by all these people, who seemed to think themselves in a public street, gently clapped her hands, and pushed them towards the door."
"Mais Jeanbernat hochait la tête, refusant du geste. Il était ébranlé, cependant. Il finit par dire :","But Jeanbernat shook his head, refusing with a gesture. He was shaken, however. He ends up saying:","Jeanbernat shook his head, and made a gesture of refusal. But he was shaken. In the end he said:","But Jeanbernat shook his head, and again waved his hand in token of refusal. However, his obstinate resolution was shaken; and at last he said: 'Well, well, let them take her, and may she break their arms for them! I only wish that she could rise up out of the ground and kill them all with fright."

"Une odeur forte de basse-cour venait par la porte ouverte, soufflant comme un ferment d’éclosion dans l’église, dans le soleil chaud qui gagnait l’autel. Désirée resta un instant debout, toute heureuse du petit monde qu’elle portait, regardant Vincent verser le vin de la purification, regardant son frère boire ce vin, pour que rien des saintes espèces ne restât dans sa bouche. Et elle était encore là, lorsqu’il revint tenant le calice à deux mains, afin de recevoir sur le pouce et sur l’index, le vin et l’eau de l’ablution, qu’il but également. Mais la poule, cherchant ses petits, arrivait en gloussant, menaçait d’entrer dans l’église. Alors, Désirée s’en alla, avec des paroles maternelles pour les poussins, au moment où le prêtre, après avoir appuyé le purificatoire sur les lèvres, le passait sur les bords, puis dans l’intérieur du calice.","A strong smell of barnyard came through the open door, blowing like a hatching ferment in the church, in the hot sun which reached the altar. Désirée remained standing for a moment, quite happy with the little world she was carrying, watching Vincent pour the wine of purification, watching her brother drink this wine, so that none of the holy species would remain in his mouth. And she was still there, when he returned holding the chalice in both hands, in order to receive on the thumb and on the index finger, the wine and the water of the ablution, which he also drank. But the hen, looking for her young, came clucking, threatening to enter the church. Then Désirée went away, with maternal words for the chicks, at the moment when the priest, after pressing the purificator to the lips, passed it over the edges, then into the interior of the chalice.","A strong farmyard odour came in from the open door, blowing a sort of ferment of new life into the church with the warm sun now reaching the altar. Désirée just stood there for a moment, delighted with the little family she was carrying, watching Vincent pouring the wine of the purification, and seeing her brother drink that wine, so that no particle of the sacred Host could remain in his mouth. And she was still there when he came back, holding the chalice in both hands, to receive on his thumb and forefinger the wine and water of the ablution, which he also drank. But when the hen came clucking along in search of her little ones and seemed about to enter the church, Désirée went away, with motherly words of comfort for the chicks, just as the priest, after pressing the purificator to his lips, ran it along the rim of the chalice, then placed it inside.","Through the open doorway now came the strong smell of a farmyard, blowing like some generative ferment into the church amidst the warm sunlight that was creeping over the altar. Desiree stood there for a moment delighted with the little ones she carried, watching Vincent pour, and her brother drink, the purifying wine, in order that nought of the sacred elements should be left within his mouth. And she stood there still when he came back to the side of the altar, holding the chalice in both hands, so that Vincent might pour over his forefingers and thumbs the wine and water of ablution, which he likewise drank. But when the mother hen ran up clucking with alarm to seek her little ones, and threatened to force her way into the church, Desiree went off, talking maternally to her chicks, while the priest, after pressing the purificator to his lips, wiped first the rim and next the interior of the chalice."
— Ne parlons plus. Nous sommes seuls à jamais. Nous nous aimons.,"""Let's not talk anymore. We are forever alone. We love ourselves.",‘Let us talk no more. We are alone forever. We love each other.’,'Do not let us talk any more. We are alone for ever. We love each other.'
III.,III.,Chapter III,III
"Le prêtre, les yeux éblouis, abaissa les regards sur le village, dont les quelques maisons s’en allaient à la débandade, au bas de l’église. Misérables maisons, faites de pierres sèches et de planches maçonnées, jetées le long d’un étroit chemin, sans rues indiquées. Elles étaient au nombre d’une trentaine, les unes tassées dans le fumier, noires de misère, les autres plus vastes, plus gaies, avec leurs tuiles roses. Des bouts de jardin, conquis sur le roc, étalaient des carrés de légumes, coupés de haies vives. À cette heure, les Artaud étaient vides ; pas une femme aux fenêtres, pas un enfant vautré dans la poussière ; seules, des bandes de poules allaient et venaient, fouillant la paille, quêtant jusqu’au seuil des maisons, dont les portes laissées ouvertes bâillaient complaisamment au soleil. Un grand chien noir, assis sur son derrière, à l’entrée du village, semblait le garder.","The priest, his eyes dazzled, lowered his gaze to the village, whose few houses were scattering below the church. Wretched houses, made of dry stones and masonry planks, thrown along a narrow path, with no marked streets. They were about thirty in number, some heaped up in the manure, black with misery, others larger, more cheerful, with their pink tiles. Pieces of garden, reclaimed from the rock, displayed squares of vegetables, cut with quickset hedges. At this hour, the Artauds were empty; not a woman at the windows, not a child wallowing in the dust; only flocks of hens came and went, rummaging in the straw, begging to the thresholds of the houses, whose doors, left open, gaped complacently in the sun. A large black dog, sitting on his behind, at the entrance to the village, seemed to guard him.","The priest now turned his dazzled eyes down to the village, with its few houses scattered haphazardly below the church. Wretched houses, made of drystone walls and planks, scattered along a narrow path with no indication of streets. There were about thirty of them, some piled up over a dungheap and black with poverty, others bigger and brighter with pink roof tiles. The bits of garden, won from the rock, showed plots of vegetables, divided by hedges. At this hour, Les Artaud was empty, with no woman at the windows, no child sprawling in the dust; just bands of chickens going around, fossicking through the straw, searching for food right up to the thresholds of the houses, whose open doors yawned pleasantly in the sun. A big black dog, sitting on its haunches at the entry to the village, seemed to be guarding it.","The priest lowered his dazzled glance upon the village, whose few scattered houses straggled away below the church—wretched hovels they were of rubble and boards strewn along a narrow path without sign of streets. There were about thirty of them altogether, some squatting amidst muck-heaps, and black with woeful want; others roomier and more cheerful-looking with their roofs of pinkish tiles. Strips of garden, victoriously planted amidst stony soil, displayed plots of vegetables enclosed by quickset hedges. At this hour Les Artaud was empty, not a woman was at the windows, not a child was wallowing in the dust; parties of fowls alone went to and fro, ferreting among the straw, seeking food up to the very thresholds of the houses, whose open doors gaped in the sunlight. A big black dog seated on his haunches at the entrance to the village seemed to be mounting guard over it."
"Le cabriolet passa devant une grille seigneuriale, toute saignante de rouille, garnie à l’intérieur de planches maçonnées. Les sauts-de-loup[27] étaient noirs de ronces. À une centaine de mètres, le pavillon habité par Jeanbernat se trouvait enclavé dans le parc, sur lequel une de ses façades donnait. Mais le gardien semblait avoir barricadé sa demeure, de ce côté ; il avait défriché un étroit jardin, sur la route ; il vivait là, au midi, tournant le dos au Paradou, sans paraître se douter de l’énormité des verdures débordant derrière lui.","The cabriolet passed a stately gate, all bleeding with rust, lined inside with masonry planks. The step-overs[27] were black with brambles. About a hundred meters away, the pavilion inhabited by Jeanbernat was enclosed in the park, on which one of its facades overlooked. But the watchman seemed to have barricaded his house on this side; he had cleared a narrow garden on the road; he lived there, to the south, turning his back on Paradou, without appearing to suspect the enormity of the greenery overflowing behind him.","The gig went past a lordly gateway, ruddy with rust, boarded up with planks on the inside. The boundary ditches were black with brambles. A hundred or so yards away, the lodge where Jeanbernat lived was enclosed within the park, which it overlooked on one side. But on this side, the caretaker seemed to have barricaded his dwelling. He had cleared a little garden by the roadside; there he lived, facing south, turning his back on the Paradou, seemingly unaware of the vast expanse of greenery pouring out behind him.","The gig passed by a lordly iron gate, ruddy with rust, and lined inside with a layer of boards. The wide dry thoats were black with brambles. A hundred yards further on was the lodge inhabited by Jeanbernat. It stood within the park, which it overlooked. But the old keeper had apparently blocked up that side of his dwelling, and had cleared a little garden by the road. And there he lived, facing southwards, with his back turned upon the Paradou, as if unaware of the immensity of verdure that stretched away behind him."
— Quoi donc ? Quoi donc ?,- What ? What ?,What was that for?’,He knew not to what impulse he was yielding.
"Alors, il tapa dans ses mains, criant :","Then he clapped his hands, shouting:","Then he clapped his hands, and shouted:",And he clapped his hands and called: 'Hie!
"— Je vais être tout neuf. Ça m’a joliment nettoyé, d’être malade… Mais qu’est-ce que tu me demandais ? Non, personne n’était là. Je souffrais tout seul, au fond d’un trou noir. Personne, personne. Et, au delà, il n’y a rien, je ne vois rien… Je suis ton enfant, veux-tu ? Tu m’apprendras à marcher. Moi, je ne vois que toi, maintenant. Ça m’est bien égal, tout ce qui n’est pas toi. Je te dis que je ne me souviens plus. Je suis venu, tu m’as pris, c’est tout.","“I'm going to be brand new. It cleaned me up nicely, being sick... But what did you ask of me? No, no one was there. I was suffering all alone, at the bottom of a black hole. Nobody, nobody. And, beyond that, there is nothing, I see nothing... I am your child, will you? You will teach me to walk. I only see you now. I don't care, anything that isn't you. I tell you that I no longer remember. I came, you took me, that's all.","‘I’m going to be all new. It’s really cleaned me up, being so ill... But what were you asking me? No. Nobody else was there. I was suffering all alone at the bottom of a black hole. Nobody. Nobody. And beyond that, there’s nothing, I can see nothing. I am your child, may I be? You will teach me to walk. Now I can see only you. I don’t care about anything that isn’t you. I tell you, I really don’t remember. I came along and you took hold of me, that’s all.’","He laughed at this simile, and continued: 'I shall be all new again. My illness has given me a fine cleaning. But what was it you were asking me? No, nobody was there. I was suffering all by myself at the bottom of a black hole. Nobody, nobody. And beyond that, nothing —I can see nothing. . . . Let me be your child, will you? You shall teach me to walk. I can see nothing else but you now. I care for nothing but you. . . . I can't remember, I tell you. I came, you took me, and that is all.'"
"— Ah ! ce n’est pas malheureux ! dit-il, lorsqu’il entendit le bruit de la porte.","- Oh! it's not unfortunate! he said, when he heard the sound of the door.","‘Ah! how very sad it is!’ he said, when he heard the sound of the door opening.","'Ah! here he comes at last,' he said, as he heard the door opening."
"— Tu n’as pas vu ? dit Serge un matin, dans une de ces heures de trouble ; il y a là, au-dessus de la porte, une femme peinte qui te ressemble.","- You did not see ? said Serge one morning, in one of those troubled hours; there, above the door, is a painted woman who looks like you.","‘Haven’t you noticed?’ asked Serge, one morning, in one of these uneasy moments. ‘Up there, over the door, there’s a painting of a woman who looks like you.’","'Have you noticed,' said Serge one morning during these uneasy intervals, 'there is a painting of a woman over the door there? She is like you.'"
"— Si, si, tu restes… Nous le mangerons, nous le mangerons !","- Yes, yes, you stay ... We will eat it, we will eat it!","‘Yes, yes, you’ll stay... And we’ll eat it, we’ll eat it!...’","Yes! yes! you'll stay, and we will eat it up, we'll eat it up!'"
— Laissons chacun disposer de son bien comme il l’entend.,"""Let everyone dispose of his property as he sees fit.",‘Let’s allow everyone to dispose of his property as he thinks fit.’,"Then calming down a bit, he added: 'Let every one do with their own as they think best.'"
"Puis, s’étant retourné pour baiser l’autel, il revint, la main gauche au-dessous de la poitrine, la main droite tendue, bénissant l’église pleine des gaietés du soleil et du tapage des moineaux.","Then, having turned to kiss the altar, he returned, his left hand below his chest, his right hand outstretched, blessing the church full of the gaiety of the sun and the tapping of the sparrows.","Then, after turning round to kiss the altar, the priest returned, his left hand below his breast, and right hand extended, to bless that church full of the joyfulness of sunshine and the noise of the sparrows.","And having turned back to kiss the altar, the priest faced round anew, his left hand just below his breast, his right outstretched whilst blessing the church, which the gladsome sunbeams and noisy sparrows filled."
"L’abbé Mouret voulut intervenir. Mais Frère Archangias le repoussa, en criant :","Father Mouret wanted to intervene. But Brother Archangias pushed him away, shouting:","Abbé Mouret tried to intervene. But Brother Archangias pushed him away, shouting:","Abbe Mouret tried to interfere, but Brother Archangias pushed him away, exclaiming: 'You are led by him yourself!"
"— Je sais, interrompit Serge, la dame n’a jamais reparu.","""I know,"" interrupted Serge, ""the lady never came back.""","‘I know,’ Serge interrupted, ‘the lady has never been seen again.’","'Ah! I know,' Serge interrupted; 'the lady was never seen again.'"
"Elle le prit, le berça un instant, le posa sur une chaise, où il dormit, dans une paix de chérubin. L’église retomba au calme triste, que coupaient seuls les cris des moineaux, sur le sorbier. À l’autel, Vincent avait reporté le Missel à droite, l’abbé Mouret venait de replier le corporal et de le glisser dans la bourse. Maintenant, il disait les dernières oraisons, avec un recueillement sévère, que n’avaient pu troubler ni les pleurs de l’enfant ni les rires des grandes filles. Il paraissait ne rien entendre, être tout aux vœux qu’il adressait au ciel pour le bonheur du couple dont il avait béni l’union. Ce matin-là, le ciel restait gris d’une poussière de chaleur, qui noyait le soleil. Par les carreaux cassés, il n’entrait qu’une buée rousse, annonçant un jour d’orage.","She took him, rocked him for a moment, put him on a chair, where he slept, in a cherubic peace. The church fell back into a sad calm, broken only by the cries of the sparrows on the mountain ash. At the altar, Vincent had taken the Missal to the right, Abbé Mouret had just folded up the corporal and slipped it into the purse. Now he was saying the last prayers, with a severe recollection, which neither the tears of the child nor the laughter of the big girls had been able to disturb. He seemed to hear nothing, to be entirely devoted to the wishes he was sending to heaven for the happiness of the couple whose union he had blessed. That morning, the sky remained gray with a dust of heat, which drowned out the sun. Through the broken panes only a reddish mist entered, announcing a stormy day.","She took him, cradled him for a moment, then laid him on a chair, where he fell asleep peacefully like a cherub. The church returned to its melancholy calm, interrupted only by the noise of the sparrows in the rowan tree. At the altar, Vincent had taken the Missal back to the right-hand side, and Abbé Mouret had just folded up the corporal and slipped it into the burse. Now he was saying the final prayers with a stern concentration that neither the cries of the child nor the laughter of the girls had been able to disturb. He seemed to hear nothing, to be totally absorbed in the prayers he was addressing to Heaven for the happiness of this couple whose union he had just blessed. That morning the sky remained grey with a heat haze that drowned out the sun. Through the broken panes there came only a reddish mist that seemed to promise a stormy day.","She took the child, hushed it in her arms for a moment, and then laid it upon a chair, where it went to sleep, peacefully like a cherub. The church then subsided into solemn quietness, disturbed only by the chattering of the sparrows on the rowan tree outside. At the altar, Vincent had carried the missal to the right again, and Abbe Mouret had just folded the corporal and slipped it within the burse. He was now saying the concluding prayers with a solemn earnestness, which neither the screams of the baby nor the giggling of the three girls had been able to disturb. He seemed to hear nothing of them, but to be wholly absorbed in the prayers which he was offering up to Heaven for the happiness of the pair whose union he had just blessed. The sky that morning was grey with a hazy heat, which veiled the sun. Through the broken windows a russet vapour streamed into the church, betokening a stormy day."
"— Jésus n’a pas besoin de tant de linge, ma bonne Teuse. Il a toujours chaud, il est toujours royalement reçu, quand on l’aime bien.","“Jesus doesn’t need so much laundry, my good Teuse. He is always warm, he is always royally received, when you like him.","‘Jesus doesn’t need that much clothing, my good Teuse. He is always warm and always royally received so long as he is loved.’","Jesus does not need so much linen, my good Teuse,' he cheerfully replied. ' He is always warm, always royally received by those who love Him well.'"
"— On dirait un satin, reprit-elle. Ils sont habillés comme des princes. Et coquets avec cela ! Tiens, en voilà un qui est toujours à se débarbouiller. Il use ses pattes… Si tu savais comme ils sont drôles ! Moi je ne dis rien, mais je m’aperçois bien de leurs malices. Ainsi, par exemple, ce gris qui nous regarde, détestait une petite femelle, que j’ai dû mettre à part. Il y a eu des histoires terribles entre eux. Ça serait trop long à conter. Enfin, la dernière fois qu’il l’a battue, comme j’arrivais furieuse, qu’est-ce que je vois ? Ce gredin-là, blotti dans le fond, qui avait l’air de râler. Il voulait me faire croire que c’était lui qui avait à se plaindre d’elle…","- It looks like a satin, she continued. They are dressed like princes. And coquettish with that! Hey, here's one who's always cleaning up. He uses his paws… If you only knew how funny they are! I say nothing, but I am well aware of their malice. So, for example, this gray looking at us hated a little female, which I had to put aside. There have been terrible stories between them. It would take too long to tell. Finally, the last time he beat her, as I arrived furious, what do I see? That rascal, huddled in the back, who seemed to be moaning. He wanted me to believe that it was he who had to complain about her...","‘It’s like satin,’ she said. ‘They are dressed like princes. And very fussy about their appearance! Look, there’s one who’s always busy cleaning himself. He’s wearing out his paws!... If you only knew how funny they are! Of course I don’t say anything, but I’m perfectly aware of their little tricks. That grey one, for instance, the one who’s looking at us, so hated one little female that I had to move her away. There were terrible scenes between them. It would take too long to tell you. But the last time he attacked her, and I arrived, furious, what did I see? That villain, huddled at the back, groaning as if at death’s door. He was trying to make me think he was the victim...’","'Wouldn't you say it was satin?' she continued. ' They are dressed like princes. And ain't they coquettish! Look, there's one who is always cleaning himself. He wears the fur off his paws. . . . If only you knew how funny they are! I say nothing, but I see all their little games. That grey one looking at us, for instance, used to hate a little doe, which I had to put somewhere else. There were terrible scenes between them. It would take too long to tell you all, but the last time he gave her a drubbing, when I came up in a rage, what do you think I saw? Why that rascal huddled up at the back there as if he was just at his last gasp. He wanted to make me believe that it was he who had to complain of her.'"
"— Mais regardez donc ! Ça jure trop, maintenant que le maître-autel est propre. On ne sait plus même s’il y a eu des peintures. J’ai beau essuyer, le matin, le bois garde toute la poussière. C’est noir, c’est laid… Vous ne savez pas ce qu’on dira, monsieur le curé ? On dira que vous n’aimez pas la sainte Vierge, voilà tout.","- But look! It swears too much, now that the high altar is clean. We don't even know if there were any paintings. No matter how much I wipe in the morning, the wood keeps all the dust. It's black, it's ugly... You don't know what they'll say, priest? People will say that you don't love the Blessed Virgin, that's all.","‘Just look! It clashes horribly now that the main altar looks so clean. You can’t even tell whether it’s ever been painted. No matter how much I wipe it over in the morning, the wood gathers dust. It’s so dark, so ugly... Don’t you realize what people will say, Monsieur le Curé? They’ll say you don’t love the Holy Virgin, that’s what.’","'Just look at it,' said she; 'it is too shabby for anything, now that the high altar is so smart. It looks as though it had never been painted at all. However much I may rub it of a morning, the dust sticks to it. It is quite black; it is filthy. Do you know what people will say about you, your reverence? They will say that you care nothing for the Blessed Virgin; that's what they'll say.'"
"Le prêtre monta. Le docteur, qui parut regretter sa plaisanterie, se montra très affectueux, tout en jetant au cheval de légers claquements de langue. Il regardait son neveu curieusement, du coin de l’œil, de cet air aigu des savants qui prennent des notes. Il l’interrogea, par petites phrases, avec bonhomie, sur sa vie, sur ses habitudes, sur le bonheur tranquille dont il jouissait aux Artaud. Et, à chaque réponse satisfaisante, il murmurait, comme se parlant à lui-même, d’un ton rassuré :","The priest came up. The doctor, who seemed to regret his joke, showed himself to be very affectionate, while giving the horse light clicks of his tongue. He looked at his nephew curiously, out of the corner of his eye, with that shrill air of scholars taking notes.

And, at each satisfactory answer, he murmured, as if talking to himself, in a reassured tone:","The priest got in. The doctor, who seemed to regret his joke, chatted affectionately, while also clucking his tongue to spur the horse on. He observed his nephew closely out of the corner of his eye, with the keen attention of a scientist taking notes.

And at every satisfactory answer, seemingly reassured, he murmured, as if to himself:","The priest got in. The doctor, apparently regretting his jest, displayed an affectionate warmth of manner, whilst from time to time clucking his tongue by way of encouraging his horse.

In short kindly sentences he inquired about his life, his habits, and the peaceful happiness he enjoyed at Les Artaud. And at each satisfactory reply he murmured, as if to himself in a tone of reassurance: 'Come, so much the better; that's just as it should be!'"
"— Ah ! C’est comme ça ! cria-t-elle. C’est encore vous qui vous fâchez ! Eh bien ! Je m’en vais ! Vous allez me payer mon voyage, pour que je m’en retourne chez moi. J’en ai assez des Artaud, et de votre église ! Et de tout !","- Ah! It's like that ! she cried. You are the one who is angry again! Well ! I am leaving ! You will pay me for my trip, so that I can return home. I have had enough of the Artauds, and of your church!

I’ve had enough of Les Artaud and your church, enough of everything.’","'Ah! that's how it is!' she exclaimed. ' There you are again, losing your temper! Very well, I am off; you can pay my fare, so that I may go back home. I have had enough of Les Artaud, and your church, and everything else!'"
"— Attends, dit Albine, lorsqu’ils furent revenus devant le pavillon. Toi, tu ne monteras que dans trois minutes.","""Wait,"" said Albine, when they had returned to the pavilion.

"— Amen, répondirent à la fois Vincent et le Frère, d’un ton si aigu et d’un ton si grave, que Catherine dut se mettre le poing sur la bouche, pour ne pas éclater.","""Amen,"" both Vincent and the Brother answered, in such a shrill tone and such a serious tone that Catherine had to put her fist over her mouth to keep from bursting out.","‘Amen,’ Vincent and Brother Archangias responded together, the one voice so high, and the other so deep, that Catherine had to clap her fist to her mouth not to burst out laughing.","'Amen,' responded Vincent and the Brother together, in tones so respectively shrill and deep that Catherine had to cram her fist into her mouth to keep from laughing."
"— Te voilà tout rouge, à présent, dit Désirée en le rejoignant de l’autre côté de la barrière.

"L’abbé Mouret, découragé, s’en alla. Comme il descendait le sentier, il aperçut Rosalie se roulant sous un olivier avec Voriau, qui lui léchait la figure, ce qui la faisait rire. Elle disait au chien :","Abbé Mouret, discouraged, went away. As he descended the path, he saw Rosalie rolling under an olive tree with Voriau, who was licking her face, which made her laugh.

"Elle en prit deux, un dans chaque main, les couvrant d’une rage de baisers.

"Il se fit beaucoup prier. La basse-cour l’effrayait un peu. Mais voyant des larmes dans les yeux de Désirée, il céda. Alors, elle se jeta à son cou, avec une joie soudaine de jeune chien, riant plus fort, sans même s’essuyer les joues.","He had to pray a lot. The barnyard frightened him a little. But seeing tears in Desiree's eyes, he gave in. Then she threw herself on his neck, with the sudden joy of a young dog, laughing harder, without even wiping her cheeks.","He was hard to persuade. The farmyard rather frightened him. But when he saw tears in Désirée’s eyes, he gave way.

But when he saw tears in Desiree's eyes, he yielded. She threw herself on his neck in a sudden puppy-like burst of glee, laughing more than ever, without attempting to dry her cheeks."
"Depuis que Désirée était aux Artaud, elle passait ses journées en pleine béatitude. Enfin, elle contentait le rêve de son existence, le seul désir qui l’eût tourmentée, au milieu de sa puérilité de faible d’esprit. Elle possédait une basse-cour, un trou qu’on lui abandonnait, où elle pouvait faire pousser les bêtes à sa guise. Dès lors, elle s’enterra là, bâtissant elle-même des cabanes pour les lapins, creusant la mare aux canards, tapant des clous, apportant de la paille, ne tolérant pas qu’on l’aidât. La Teuse en était quitte pour la débarbouiller. La basse-cour se trouvait située derrière le cimetière ; souvent même, Désirée devait rattraper, au milieu des tombes, quelque poule curieuse, sautée par-dessus le mur. Au fond, se trouvait un hangar où étaient la lapinière et le poulailler ; à droite, logeait la chèvre, dans une petite écurie. D’ailleurs, tous les animaux vivaient ensemble, les lapins lâchés avec les poules, la chèvre prenant des bains de pieds au milieu des canards, les oies, les dindes, les pintades, les pigeons fraternisant en compagnie de trois chats. Quand elle se montrait à la barrière de bois qui empêchait tout ce monde de pénétrer dans l’église, un vacarme assourdissant la saluait.","Ever since Desiree had been at Artaud, she had passed her days in complete bliss. Finally, she satisfied the dream of her existence, the only desire that had tormented her, in the midst of her feeble-minded childishness. She had a barnyard, a hole left to her, where she could grow animals as she pleased. From then on, she buried herself there, building huts for the rabbits herself, digging the duck pond, hammering nails, bringing straw, not tolerating anyone to help her. La Teuse got off with washing her face. The poultry yard was situated behind the cemetery; often even, Désirée had to catch up, in the middle of the tombs, with some curious hen, which had jumped over the wall. At the back, there was a shed where the rabbit hutch and the chicken coop were; on the right, lodged the goat, in a small stable. Moreover, all the animals lived together, the rabbits released with the hens, the goat taking foot baths in the middle of the ducks, the geese, the turkeys, the guinea fowl, the pigeons fraternizing in the company of three cats. When she appeared at the wooden barrier which prevented everyone from entering the church, a deafening uproar greeted her.","Ever since she had been at Les Artaud, Désirée’s days had been spent in perfect bliss. At last she could fulfil the dream of her existence, the one desire that had ever tormented her in the infantile weakness of her mind. She had a farmyard of her own, a little place left entirely to her, where she could raise animals as she pleased. And so she buried herself in it, building with her own hands hutches for the rabbits, digging out a pond for the ducks, hammering nails in, carrying straw, allowing no one to help her. All La Teuse had to do was wash her afterwards. The farmyard was located behind the cemetery; indeed Désirée often had to go chasing among the tombs to catch some inquisitive hen who had jumped over the wall. At the far end was a shed, where the rabbit hutches were, and the henhouse; on the right, a little stable for the goat. In fact all the animals lived together, the rabbits running about among the hens, the goat paddling about among the ducks, the geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, and pigeons all intermingling along with three cats. As soon as Désirée showed up at the wooden gate that kept this whole population from getting into the church, she would be greeted by a deafening uproar.","Since she had been living at Les Artaud, she had spent her days in complete beatitude. At last she was satisfying the dream of her life, the only desire which had worried her amidst her weak-minded puerility. She had a poultry-yard, a nook all to herself, where she could breed animals to her heart's content. And she almost lived there, building rabbit-hutches with her own hands, digging out a pond for the ducks, knocking in nails, fetching straw, allowing no one to assist her. All that La Teuse had to do was to wash her afterwards. The poultry-yard was situated behind the cemetery; and Desiree often had to jump the wall, and run hither and thither among the graves after some fowl whom curiosity had led astray. Right at the end was a shed giving accommodation to the fowls and the rabbits; to the right was a little stable for the goat. Moreover, all the animals lived together; the rabbits ran about with the fowls, the nanny-goat would take a footbath in the midst of the ducks; the geese, the turkeys, the guinea-fowls, and the pigeons all fraternised in the company of three cats. Whenever Desiree appeared at the wooden fence which prevented her charges from making their way into the church, a deafening uproar greeted her."

"Arrivé sous le petit hangar, près de la cuisine, il s’extasia sur l’excellence de la lessive, voulant faire plaisir à la Teuse ; il fallut même qu’il la sentit, qu’il mit les doigts dedans.

Elle traversa l’église, pour sonner l’Angélus, boitant davantage dans sa hâte, bousculant les bancs. La corde, près du confessionnal, tombait du plafond, nue, râpée, terminée par un gros nœud, que les mains avaient graissé ; et elle s’y pendit de toute sa masse, à coups réguliers, puis s’y abandonna, roulant dans ses jupes, le bonnet de travers, le sang crevant sa face large.","La Teuse, on entering, placed her broom and feather duster against the altar.

"Puis, Albine et Serge entrèrent jusqu’à la taille dans un champ de pivoines. Les fleurs blanches crevaient, avec une pluie de larges pétales qui leur rafraîchissaient les mains, pareilles aux gouttes larges d’une pluie d’orage. Les fleurs rouges avaient des faces apoplectiques, dont le rire énorme les inquiétait. Ils gagnèrent, à gauche, un champ de fuchsias, un taillis d’arbustes souples, déliés, qui les ravirent comme des joujoux du Japon, garnis d’un million de clochettes. Ils traversèrent ensuite des champs de véroniques aux grappes violettes, des champs de géraniums et de pélargoniums, sur lesquels semblaient courir des flammèches ardentes, le rouge, le rose, le blanc incandescent d’un brasier, que les moindres souffles du vent ravivaient sans cesse. Ils durent tourner des rideaux de glaïeuls, aussi grands que des roseaux, dressant des hampes de fleurs qui brûlaient dans la clarté, avec des richesses de flamme de torches allumées. Ils s’égarèrent au milieu d’un bois de tournesols, une futaie faite de troncs aussi gros que la taille d’Albine, obscurcie par des feuilles rudes, larges à y coucher un enfant, peuplée de faces géantes, de faces d’astre, resplendissantes comme autant de soleils. Et ils arrivèrent enfin dans un autre bois, un bois de rhododendrons, si touffu de fleurs que les branches et les feuilles ne se voyaient pas, étalant des bouquets monstrueux, des hottées de calices tendres qui moutonnaient jusqu’à l’horizon.","Then Albine and Serge walked waist-deep into a field of peonies. The white flowers burst, with a rain of large petals that cooled their hands, like the large drops of a stormy rain. The red flowers had apoplectic faces, whose enormous laughter worried them. They reached, on the left, a field of fuchsias, a thicket of supple, slender shrubs, which delighted them like Japanese toys, adorned with a million bells. They then crossed fields of speedwells with purple clusters, fields of geraniums and pelargoniums, over which burning flames seemed to run, the red, the pink, the incandescent white of a brazier, which the slightest gusts of wind ceaselessly revived. . They had to turn curtains of gladioli, as tall as reeds, raising flower spikes that burned in the light, with riches of flame from lighted torches. They lost their way in the middle of a wood of sunflowers, a forest made of trunks as big as Albina's height, obscured by rough leaves, wide enough to lay a child there, peopled with giant faces, star faces. , resplendent like so many suns. And they arrived at last in another wood, a wood of rhododendrons, so thick with flowers that the branches and the leaves could not be seen, spreading out monstrous bouquets, bundles of tender chalices which curled up to the horizon.","Then Albine and Serge went up to their waists into a field of peonies. The white flowers were dying, making a shower of wide petals that cooled their hands, like the heavy raindrops of a storm. The red flowers had apoplectic faces, with broad, disturbing grins. On the left, they reached a field of fuchsias, a thicket of supple, slender shrubs, that delighted them like Japanese toys, laden with thousands of bells. They next went through fields of veronicas, with their purple clusters, then geraniums and pelargoniums, over which ardent little flames seemed to fly with the white, pink, and red incandescence of a brazier, constantly fanned into life by the slightest puffs of wind. They had to go round curtains of gladioli, tall as reeds, holding up their poles of flowers that burned in the light with the rich flame of blazing torches. They lost their way in a forest of sunflowers, with trunks the size of Albine’s waist, a forest darkened by rough leaves, wide enough to cradle a baby, and peopled by giant faces, star-like faces, brilliant, like so many suns. And at last they reached a wood of rhododendrons, so densely packed with flowers that the branches and leaves were totally hidden, in a display of monstrous bunches, basketfuls, of soft flower heads, tumbling away to the horizon.","Then Albine and Serge passed on through a rank growth of peonies, reaching to their waists. The white flowers fell to pieces as they passed, with a rain of snowy petals which was as refreshing to their hands as the heavy drops of a thunder shower. And the red ones grinned with apoplectical faces which perturbed them. Next they passed through a field of fuchsias, forming dense, vigorous shrubs that delighted them with their countless bells. Then they went on through fields of purple veronicas and others of geraniums, blazing with all the fiery tints of a brasier, which the wind seemed to be ever fanning into fresh heat. And they forced their way through a jungle of gladioli, tall as reeds, which threw up spikes of flowers that gleamed in the full daylight with all the brilliance of burning torches. They lost themselves too in a forest of sunflowers, with stalks as thick as Albine's wrist, a forest darkened by rough leaves large enough to form an infant's bed, and peopled with giant starry faces that shone like so many suns. And thence they passed into another forest, a forest of rhododendrons so teeming with blossom that the branches and leaves were completely hidden, and nothing but huge nosegays, masses of soft calyces, could be seen as far as the eye could reach."

"Jésus restait sourd. Un instant, l’abbé Mouret implora le ciel de ses bras éperdument levés. Ses épaules craquaient de l’élan extraordinaire de ses supplications. Et bientôt ses mains retombèrent, découragées. Il y avait au ciel un de ces silences sans espoir que les dévots connaissent. Alors, il s’assit de nouveau sur la marche de l’autel, écrasé, le visage terreux, se serrant les flancs de ses coudes, comme pour diminuer sa chair. Il se rapetissait sous la dent de la tentation.","Jesus remained deaf. For a moment Abbé Mouret implored heaven with his arms uplifted. His shoulders creaked with the extraordinary momentum of his supplications. And soon his hands fell down, discouraged. There was one of those hopeless silences in heaven that devotees know. Then he sat down again on the altar step, crushed, his face dull, clutching his sides with his elbows, as if to lessen his flesh. He was shrinking under the tooth of temptation.","Jesus remained deaf to his cry. For a moment, Abbé Mouret implored Heaven, his arms raised in desperate supplication. His shoulders seemed to be breaking with the extraordinary force of his appeals. But soon his hands fell down in discouragement. In Heaven there was one of those hopeless silences sometimes experienced by the devout. Then he sat down again on the altar step, his face ashen, pressing his sides with his elbows as if to master his fleshly being. He was trying to shrink away from the bite of temptation.","But Jesus remained deaf to his cry. For a moment Abbe Mouret raised his arms to heaven in desperate entreaty. His shoulders cracked and strained beneath the wild violence of his supplications. But soon his hands fell down again in discouragement. Heaven preserved that hopeless silence which suppliants at times encounter. Then he once more sat down on the altar steps, heart-crushed and with ashen face, pressing his elbows to his sides, as though he were trying to reduce his flesh to the smallest proportions possible."

"L’instant redoutable approchait. Le corps et le sang d’un Dieu allaient descendre sur l’autel. Le prêtre baisait la nappe, joignait les mains, multipliait les signes de croix sur l’hostie et sur le calice. Les prières du canon ne tombaient plus de ses lèvres que dans une extase d’humilité et de reconnaissance. Ses attitudes, ses gestes, ses inflexions de voix, disaient le peu qu’il était, l’émotion qu’il éprouvait à être choisi pour une si grande tâche. Vincent vint s’agenouiller derrière lui ; il prit la chasuble de la main gauche, la soutint légèrement, apprêtant la clochette. Et lui, les coudes appuyés au bord de la table, tenant l’hostie entre le pouce et l’index de chaque main, prononça sur elle les paroles de la consécration : Hoc est enim corpus meum. Puis, ayant fait une génuflexion, il l’éleva lentement, aussi haut qu’il put, en la suivant des yeux, pendant que le servant sonnait, à trois fois, prosterné. Il consacra ensuite le vin : Hic est enim calix[20], les coudes de nouveau sur l’autel, saluant, élevant le calice, le suivant à son tour des yeux, la main droite serrant le nœud, la gauche soutenant le pied. Le servant donna trois derniers coups de clochette. Le grand mystère de la Rédemption venait d’être renouvelé, le Sang adorable coulait une fois de plus.","The dreadful moment was approaching. The body and blood of a God was going to come down on the altar. The priest kissed the tablecloth, joined his hands, multiplied the signs of the cross on the host and on the chalice. The prayers of the cannon no longer fell from his lips except in an ecstasy of humility and gratitude. His attitudes, his gestures, his inflections of voice, said how little he was, the emotion he felt at being chosen for such a great task. Vincent came to kneel behind him; he took the chasuble with his left hand, supported it lightly, readying the bell. And he, leaning his elbows on the edge of the table, holding the host between the thumb and forefinger of each hand, pronounced over her the words of consecration: Hoc est enim corpus meum. Then, having genuflected, he raised her slowly, as high as he could, following her with his eyes, while the servant rang, three times, prostrate. He then consecrated the wine: Hic est enim calix[20], his elbows again on the altar, saluting, raising the chalice, following it in turn with his eyes, his right hand tightening the knot, the left supporting the foot. The servant gave three final bells. The great mystery of redemption had just been renewed, the adorable Blood was flowing once more.","The fateful moment drew near. The body and blood of a God were about to come down upon the altar. The priest was kissing the altar cloth, clasping his hands together, and making the sign of the cross over and over on the Host and the chalice. The prayers of the Canon of the Mass* now fell from his lips in an ecstasy of humility and thankfulness. His attitudes and gestures and the inflections of his voice all spoke of his littleness, and the emotion he felt at being chosen for so great a task. Vincent went and knelt behind him and took the chasuble in his left hand, lifting it gently, holding the bell ready in his other hand. And the priest, his elbows resting on the edge of the altar, and holding the Host between the thumb and forefinger of each hand, pronounced over it the words of consecration: ‘Hoc est corpus meum.’ * Then, after a genuflexion, he slowly raised it as high as he could, keeping his eyes fixed on it, while the server, prostrate before the altar, rang the bell three times. The priest then consecrated the wine: ‘Hic est enim calix.’ * The server rang three last times. The great mystery of Redemption had once again been renewed, and the adored Blood flowed once more.","The dread moment was at hand. The body and the blood of a God were about to descend upon the altar. The priest kissed the altar-cloth, clasped his hands, and multiplied signs of the cross over host and chalice. The prayers of the canon of the mass now fell from his lips in a very ecstasy of humility and gratitude. His attitude, his gestures, the inflections of his voice, all expressed his consciousness of his littleness, his emotion at being selected for so great a task. Vincent came and knelt beside him, lightly lifted the chasuble with his left hand, the bell ready in his right; and the priest, his elbows resting on the edge of the altar, holding the host with the thumbs and forefingers of both hands, pronounced over it the words of consecration: Hoc est enim corpus meum. Then having bowed the knee before it, he raised it slowly as high as his hands could reach, following it upwards with his eyes, while the kneeling server rang the bell thrice. Then he consecrated the wine—Hic est enim calix —leaning once more upon his elbows, bowing, raising the cup aloft, his right hand round the stem, his left holding its base, and his eyes following it aloft. Again the server rang the bell three times. The great mystery of the Redemption had once more been repeated, once more had the adorable Blood flowed forth."
"Le prêtre, très troublé, désespérant de faire lâcher prise à son compagnon, tourna le dos pour continuer sa route, espérant encore éviter Jeanbernat, en se hâtant de gagner la maison des Bambousse.

"Brusquement, l’abbé Mouret se souvint. La fièvre dont il entendait la poursuite, l’avait atteint dans la basse-cour de Désirée, en face des poules chaudes encore de leur ponte et des mères lapines, s’arrachant le poil du ventre. Alors, la sensation d’une respiration sur son cou fut si nette, qu’il se tourna, pour voir enfin qui le prenait ainsi à la nuque. Et il se rappela Albine bondissant hors du Paradou, avec la porte qui claquait sur l’apparition d’un jardin enchanté ; il se la rappela galopant le long de l’interminable muraille, suivant le cabriolet à la course, jetant des feuilles de bouleau au vent comme autant de baisers ; il se la rappela encore, au crépuscule, qui riait des jurons de Frère Archangias, les jupes fuyantes au ras du chemin, pareilles à une petite fumée de poussière roulée par l’air du soir. Elle avait seize ans ; elle était étrange, avec sa face un peu longue ; sentait le grand air, l’herbe, la terre. Et il avait d’elle une mémoire si précise, qu’il revoyait une égratignure, à l’un de ses poignets souples, rose sur la peau blanche. Pourquoi donc riait-elle ainsi, en le regardant de ses yeux bleus ? Il était pris dans son rire, comme dans une onde sonore qui résonnait partout contre sa chair ; il la respirait, il l’entendait vibrer en lui. Oui, tout son mal venait de ce rire qu’il avait bu.","Abbé Mouret suddenly remembered. The fever of which he heard the continuation had reached him in Désirée's barnyard, opposite the hot hens still laying their eggs and the mother rabbits, tearing the hair from their stomachs. Then the sensation of breathing on his neck was so distinct that he turned to finally see who was taking him by the neck. And he remembered Albine leaping out of the Paradou, with the door slamming on the appearance of an enchanted garden; he remembered her galloping along the interminable wall, following the gig at a run, throwing birch leaves to the wind like so many kisses; he remembered her still, at dusk, laughing at Brother Archangias's oaths, her skirts flowing low to the road, like a little smoke of dust rolled up by the evening air. She was sixteen; she was strange, with her rather long face; smelled of fresh air, grass, earth. And he had such a precise memory of her that he saw a scratch on one of her supple wrists, pink on the white skin. Why was she laughing like that, looking at him with her blue eyes? He was caught up in her laughter, like in a sound wave that echoed everywhere against his flesh; he breathed it in, he heard it vibrate within him. Yes, all his pain came from that laughter he had drunk.","Suddenly, Abbé Mouret remembered. The fever he had seemed to hear pursuing him had caught up with him in Désirée’s farmyard, when he was looking at the hens still warm from their laying, and the female rabbits tugging out the hair from their bellies. Then he had such a clear sensation of something breathing on his neck that he had turned round to see, finally, who was thus clutching at his neck. And he remembered Albine bounding out from the Paradou, and the door slamming on the glimpse of an enchanted garden; he remembered her galloping the length of that interminable wall, racing along behind the gig throwing birch leaves to the winds like so many kisses, and he remembered her again, in the twilight, laughing at the oaths of Brother Archangias, with her skirts flying along the path like a little cloud of dust, bowled along by the evening breeze. She was sixteen; she was strange, with her rather long face; she smelled of fresh air and grass and earth. And his memory of her was so precise that he could see again the scratch on one of her supple wrists, so pink on her white skin. And why then did she laugh like that, as she gazed at him with her blue eyes? He was caught in her laugh, as if in a sound wave that resonated through his whole body; he breathed it in, he could hear it vibrating within him. Yes, all his ills came from that laugh that he had absorbed.","Then all at once Abbe Mouret remembered: The fever had struck him in Desiree's farmyard, while he was looking at the hens still warm from laying, the rabbit-does plucking the down from under them. And now the feeling that some one was breathing on his neck became so distinct that he turned at last to see who was behind him. And then he recalled Albine bounding out of the Paradou, and the door slamming upon the vision of an enchanted garden; he recalled the girl racing alongside the interminable wall, following the gig at a run, and throwing birch leaves to the breeze as kisses; he recalled her, again, in the twilight, laughing at the oaths of Brother Archangias, her skirts skimming over the path like a cloudlet of dust bowled along by the evening breeze. She was sixteen; how strange she looked, with her rather elongated face! she savoured of the open air, of the grass, of mother earth. And so accurate was his recollection of her that he could once more see a scratch upon one of her supple wrists, a rosy scar on her white skin. Why did she laugh like that when she looked at him with her blue eyes? He was engulfed in her laugh as in a sonorous wave which resounded and pressed close to him on every side; he inhaled it, he felt it vibrate within him. Yes, all his evil came from that laugh of hers which he had quaffed."
"— Moi, je crois qu’il a un chagrin, reprit Babet. On dirait qu’il se mine. Son visage semble mort, mais ses yeux luisent, allez ! Vous ne le voyez pas, lorsqu’il baisse lentement les paupières, comme pour éteindre ses yeux.","“I think he is sad,” resumed Babet. Looks like he's losing himself. His face looks dead, but his eyes are shining, come on! You don't see him, when he slowly lowers his eyelids, as if to extinguish his eyes.","‘Well, I think he has some secret sorrow,’ Babet went on. ‘ He looks as if he’s pining away. His face seems dead, but my word, his eyes gleam! You don’t see it when he slowly lowers his eyelids as if to dim those eyes.’","'I believe he's got some great trouble,' said Babet. ' He looks as though he were pining away. His face is deadly pale, but how his eyes glitter! When he drops his eyelids, it is just as though he were doing it to extinguish the fire in his eyes.'"

"Il s’était affaissé, à demi assis sur la marche de l’autel, ne trouvant plus de paroles, laissant son haleine fumer comme un encens, entre ses lèvres entrouvertes. L’abondance de la grâce le baignait d’une extase ineffable. Il se repliait sur lui-même, il cherchait Jésus au fond de son être, dans le sanctuaire d’amour qu’il préparait à chaque minute pour le recevoir dignement. Et Jésus était présent, il le sentait là, à la douceur extraordinaire qui l’inondait. Alors, il entama avec Jésus une de ces conversations intérieures, pendant lesquelles il était ravi à la terre, causant bouche à bouche avec son Dieu. Il balbutiait le verset du cantique : « Mon bien-aimé est à moi, et je suis à lui ; il repose entre les lis, jusqu’à ce que l’aurore se lève et que les ombres déclinent. » Il méditait les mots de l’Imitation : « C’est un grand art que de savoir causer avec Jésus, et une grande prudence que de savoir le retenir près de soi. » Puis, c’était une familiarité adorable. Jésus se baissait jusqu’à lui, l’entretenait pendant des heures de ses besoins, de ses bonheurs, de ses espoirs. Et deux amis qui, après une séparation, se retrouvent, s’en vont à l’écart, au bord de quelque rivière solitaire, ont des confidences moins attendries ; car Jésus, à ces heures d’abandon divin, daignait être son ami, le meilleur, le plus fidèle, celui qui ne le trahissait jamais, qui lui rendait pour un peu d’affection tous les trésors de la vie éternelle. Cette fois surtout, le prêtre voulut le posséder longtemps. Six heures sonnaient dans l’église muette, qu’il l’écoutait encore, au milieu du silence des créatures.","He had collapsed, half seated on the altar step, finding no more words, letting his breath smoke like incense between his parted lips. The abundance of grace bathed him in ineffable ecstasy. He withdrew into himself, he sought Jesus in the depths of his being, in the sanctuary of love that he prepared every minute to receive him worthily. And Jesus was present, he felt it there, in the extraordinary sweetness that flooded him. Then he began with Jesus one of those interior conversations, during which he was raptured to the earth, talking mouth to mouth with his God. He stammered the verse of the hymn: “My beloved is mine, and I am his; he rests between the lilies, until the dawn rises and the shadows decline. He meditated on the words of the Imitation: “It is a great art to know how to talk with Jesus, and a great prudence to know how to keep him close to you. Then, it was an adorable familiarity. Jesus bent down to him, talked to him for hours about his needs, his happiness, his hopes. And two friends who, after a separation, meet again, go away to the edge of some solitary river, have less tender confidences; for Jesus, in those hours of divine abandonment, deigned to be his friend, the best, the most faithful, the one who never betrayed him, who returned to him for a little affection all the treasures of eternal life. This time especially, the priest wanted to possess it for a long time. Six o'clock struck in the mute church, which he still listened to, in the midst of the silence of creatures.","He sank down, half sitting on the altar step, no longer able to find words, but letting his breath escape like incense from between his half-open lips. The plenitude of grace bathed him in an inexpressible ecstasy. He turned in on himself, seeking Jesus in the depths of his being, in the sanctuary of love that he was constantly making ready, in order to receive him worthily. And Jesus was present, he could tell he was there, by the extraordinary sweetness that flooded through him. He then began, with Jesus, one of those inner conversations during which he felt carried away from the earth, talking mouth to mouth with his God. He stammered out the verse from the Song of Songs: * ‘My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies. Until the day break, and the shadows flee away.’ He pondered on the words from The Imitation of Christ: * ‘It is a great art to know how to hold converse with Jesus, and to know how to keep Jesus is wisdom indeed.’ Then there was an adorable familiarity. Jesus came down and talked with him for hours about his needs, his joys, and his hopes. These confidences had all the tenderness of two friends meeting again after a separation, and sitting together on the bank of some solitary river; for Jesus, at these times of divine freedom, deigned to be his friend, his best, most faithful friend, who could never betray him, and who, in return for some affection, offered all the treasures of eternal life. This time especially, the priest meant to keep him a long time. He was still listening to him, in the silence of all living creatures, when six o’clock struck in the quiet church.","He sank down upon the altar steps, unable to utter another word, while his breath panted incense-like from his parted lips. The divine grace bathed him in ineffable ecstasy. He sought Jesus in the recesses of his being, in that sanctuary of love which he was ever preparing for His worthy reception. And Jesus was now present there. The Abbe knew it by the sweet influences which permeated him. And thereupon he joined with Jesus in that spiritual converse which at times bore him away from earth to companionship with God. He sighed out the verse from the 'Song of Solomon,' 'My beloved is mine, and I am his; He feedeth his flock among the lilies, until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away.' He pondered over the words of the 'Imitation:' ' It is a great art to know how to talk with Jesus, and it requires much prudence to keep Him near one.' And then, with adorable condescension, Jesus came down to him, and spoke with him for hours of his needs, his happiness, and his hopes. Their confidences were not less affectionate and touching than those of two friends, who meet after long separation and quietly retire to converse on the bank of some lonely stream; for during those hours of divine condescension Jesus deigned to be his friend, his best, most faithful friend, one who never forsook him, and who in return for a little love gave him all the treasures of eternal life. That day the priest was eager to prolong the sweet converse, and indeed, when six o'clock sounded through the quiet church, he was still listening to the words which echoed through his soul."
"Personne ne répondit. Alors, en entrant dans le vestibule, il vit une chose qu’il n’avait jamais vue. Au fond du couloir, au bas de la cage noire de l’escalier, une porte était ouverte sur le Paradou ; l’immense jardin, sous le soleil pâle, roulait ses feuilles jaunes, étendait sa mélancolie d’automne. Il franchit le seuil de cette porte, il fit quelques pas sur l’herbe humide.","No one answered. Then, as he entered the vestibule, he saw something he had never seen.

"— Oh ! Maintenant, murmura-t-elle en souriant de son air effronté, il n’y a plus de risque, puisque ça y est.","- Oh !

Elle mâchait entre ses dents des paroles qu’elle accompagnait de grands haussements d’épaules.","And he walked away, looking solid, his head erect, having won. His cassock, along the borders of thyme, had a very soft rustle. La Teuse, who had remained planted in the same place, picked up her bowl and her wooden spoon, grumbling. She chewed words between her teeth, which she accompanied with great shrugs.","And he walked away, looking quite sturdy, with head held high, having conquered his emotions. His cassock made a very gentle rustling against the borders of thyme. La Teuse, who had stayed rooted to the same spot, picked up her bowl and her wooden spoon, grumbling the while. She was muttering between her teeth words that she accompanied with much hefty shrugging:","With these words he went off, bearing himself sturdily, with his head erect, for he had vanquished his feelings. His cassock rustled very gently against the borders of thyme. La Teuse, who for a moment had remained rooted to the spot where she was standing, sulkily picked up her basin and wooden spoon. Then, shrugging her big shoulders again and again, she mumbled between her teeth:"
"Puis, lui serrant la main :","Then, shaking his hand:","Then, taking his hand:","And with a clasp of the hand, he added: 'Well, if you only had such parishioners as that old brute Jeanbernat, you wouldn't often be disturbed."
"— La grande bête ! murmura-t-il, charmé. Puis, la prenant par les poignets, pendant qu’elle continuait à sauter :","""The great beast!"" he murmured, charmed. Then, taking her by the wrists, while she continued to jump:","‘My big animal!’ he muttered, quite delighted. Then taking hold of her by her wrists, while she went on leaping about, he said:","'You big silly!' he said; and clasping her by the wrists as she continued skipping gleefully about him, he went on: 'No, dear; not to-day."
"— Que le diable leur casse les cuisses ! Qu’il les cloue au derrière l’un de l’autre comme des chiens ! Qu’il les traîne par les pieds, le nez dans leur ordure !","""May the devil break their thighs!"" Let him nail them behind each other like dogs! Let him drag them by the feet, his nose in their filth!","‘May the devil break their thighs! May he nail them rump to rump like dogs! May he drag them by their feet, with their noses in their filth.’","'May the devil break their legs for them! May he drag them to hell by their feet, with their noses trailing in their abomination!'"
"Lorsque Albine et Serge s’éveillèrent de la stupeur de leur félicité, ils se sourirent. Ils revenaient d’un pays de lumière. Ils redescendaient de très haut. Alors, ils se serrèrent la main, pour se remercier. Ils se reconnurent et se dirent :","When Albine and Serge awoke from the amazement of their happiness, they smiled at each other. They were returning from a land of light. They were coming down from very high. So they shook hands to thank each other. They recognized each other and said:","When Albine and Serge awoke from their trance of bliss, they smiled at each other. They were returning from a land of light. They were coming down from a great height. Then they pressed each other’s hands in gratitude. There was a mutual recognition, and they each said in turn:",Albine and Serge smiled at one another.
— Comment m’aimes-tu ?,"""How do you love me?""",‘How do you love me?’,"Then, lifting up her blue eyes, in which the light of love was dawning, she asked, 'How do you love me?'"

"— Vous n’avez jamais voulu connaître l’histoire de l’abbé Caffin. Dès que je parle, vous me faites taire… Eh bien ! l’abbé Caffin, dans notre pays, à Canteleu, avait eu des ennuis. C’était pourtant un bien saint homme, et qui possédait un caractère d’or. Mais, voyez-vous, il était très douillet, il aimait les choses délicates. Si bien qu’une demoiselle rôdait autour de lui, la fille d’un meunier, que ses parents avaient mise en pension. Bref, il arriva ce qui devait arriver, vous me comprenez, n’est-ce pas ? Alors, quand on a su la chose, tout le pays s’est fâché contre l’abbé. On le cherchait pour le tuer à coups de pierres. Il s’est sauvé à Rouen, il est allé pleurer chez l’archevêque. Et on l’a envoyé ici. Le pauvre homme était bien assez puni de vivre dans ce trou… Plus tard, j’ai eu des nouvelles de la fille. Elle a épousé un marchand de bœufs. Elle est très heureuse.","“You never wanted to know the story of Abbé Caffin. As soon as I speak, you silence me... Well! Abbé Caffin, in our country, at Canteleu, had been in trouble. He was, however, a very holy man, and possessed a character of gold. But, you see, he was very cozy, he liked delicate things. So that a young lady prowled around him, the daughter of a miller, whom her parents had boarded. In short, what had to happen happened, you understand me, don't you? So, when we found out, the whole country got angry with the abbot. They were looking for him to kill him with stones. He fled to Rouen, he went to cry at the Archbishop's. And we sent him here. The poor man was punished enough to live in this hole… Later, I heard from the girl. She married a beef merchant. She is very happy.","‘You’ve never been willing to hear the story of Abbé Caffin. As soon as I begin, you make me stop... Well, Abbé Caffin, in our home town of Canteleu, had had a bit of trouble. And yet he was a saintly man, with a character of solid gold. But you see, he was very sensitive, and he liked delicate things. So one young lady was always prowling around him, a miller’s daughter, whose parents had sent her away to boarding school. Briefly, what was bound to happen, happened, you understand me, don’t you? Then when it all came out, everybody was furious with the abbé. People were looking for him to stone him to death. He fled to Rouen and told his sad story to the archbishop. And he got sent here. It was quite enough punishment to have to live in this dump... Later on I had news of the girl. She married a cattle merchant. She’s very happy.’","'You would never let me tell you about Abbe Caffin. As soon as I began to speak of him, you always made me stop. Well, well; Abbe Caffin had had his troubles in my part of the world, at Canteleu. And yet he was a very holy man, with an irreproachable character. But, you see, he was a man of very delicate taste, and liked soft pretty things. Well, there was a young party who was always prowling round him, the daughter of a miller, whom her parents had sent to a boarding-school. Well, to put it shortly, what was likely to happen did happen. When the story got about, all the neighbourhood was very indignant with the Abbe. But he managed to escape to Rouen, and poured out his grief to the Archbishop there. Then he was sent here. The poor man was punished quite enough by being made to live in this hole of a place. I heard of the girl afterwards. She had married a cattle-dealer, and was very happy.'"
"Il resta appesanti, avec des roses qui lui bouchaient les yeux et la bouche. Cela fit rire Albine. Elle se pencha. Elle lui baisa de tout son cœur les deux yeux, elle lui baisa la bouche, soufflant ses baisers pour faire envoler les roses ; mais les roses lui restaient aux lèvres, et elle eut un rire plus sonore, tout amusée par cette caresse dans les fleurs.","He remained heavy, with roses covering his eyes and mouth. This made Albine laugh. She bent down. She kissed his eyes with all her heart, she kissed his mouth, blowing her kisses to make the roses fly; but the roses remained on her lips, and she gave a more sonorous laugh, quite amused by this caress in the flowers.","He remained weighed down with sleep, roses covering his eyes and his mouth. This made Albine laugh. She leaned over. She kissed both his eyes with all her heart, then she kissed his mouth, blowing her kisses to make the roses fly off, but the roses remained on his lips, and she laughed more deeply, greatly amused by this flowery caress.","He did not stir, however, but still lay there with the roses on his eyes and mouth. This made Albine laugh. She stooped down, and with her whole heart kissed both his eyes and his mouth, blowing as she kissed to drive the rose petals away; but they remained upon his lips, and she broke into still louder laughter, intensely amused at this flowery caressing."
"Serge avait sauté de l’arbre pour la recevoir dans ses bras. Comme il restait tout pâle de l’émotion qu’il venait d’avoir, elle le plaisanta.","Serge had jumped from the tree to receive her in his arms. As he remained quite pale from the emotion he had just had, she joked with him.","Serge had leaped down from the tree to receive her in his arms.

"À cette heure, Albine, dans le Paradou, rôdait encore, traînant l’agonie muette d’une bête blessée. Elle ne pleurait plus. Elle avait un visage blanc, traversé au front d’un grand pli. Pourquoi donc souffrait-elle toute cette mort ? De quelle faute était-elle coupable, pour que, brusquement, le jardin ne lui tint plus les promesses qu’il lui faisait depuis l’enfance. Et elle s’interrogeait, allant devant elle, sans voir les allées où l’ombre coulait peu à peu. Pourtant, elle avait toujours obéi aux arbres. Elle ne se souvenait pas d’avoir cassé une fleur. Elle était restée la fille aimée des verdures, les écoutant avec soumission, s’abandonnant à elles, pleine de foi dans les bonheurs qu’elles lui réservaient. Lorsque, au dernier jour, le Paradou lui avait crié de se coucher sous l’arbre géant, elle s’était couchée, elle avait ouvert les bras, répétant la leçon soufflée par les herbes. Alors, si elle ne trouvait rien à se reprocher, c’était donc le jardin qui la trahissait, qui la torturait, pour la seule joie de la voir souffrir.","At this hour, Albine, in the Paradou, was still prowling about, dragging the mute agony of a wounded animal. She was no longer crying. She had a white face, crossed across the forehead by a large crease. Why did she suffer all this death? What fault was she guilty of, that suddenly the garden no longer kept the promises it had made to her since childhood? And she wondered, going in front of her, without seeing the alleys where the shadow was flowing little by little. Yet she had always obeyed the trees. She didn't remember breaking a flower. She had remained the beloved daughter of greenery, listening to them submissively, abandoning herself to them, full of faith in the happiness they reserved for her. When, on the last day, the Paradou had shouted at her to lie down under the giant tree, she had gone to bed, she had opened her arms, repeating the lesson blown by the herbs. So, if she found nothing to reproach herself with, then it was the garden that betrayed her, that tortured her, for the sole joy of seeing her suffer.","At that same time, Albine was still wandering about in the Paradou, with the dumb agony of a wounded animal. She was no longer weeping. Her face was white, with one deep furrow on her brow. Why was she suffering such a death? What sin had she committed that the garden no longer kept the promises it had made her since she was a child? And she went on questioning herself, just walking onward, without seeing the paths which were gradually filling with darkness. But she had always obeyed the trees. She could not remember ever having broken a flower. She had remained the beloved girl of the green plants, had listened to them submissively, trusting herself to them, full of faith in the happiness they intended for her. When, on the last day, the Paradou had cried out to her telling her to lie down beneath the giant tree, she had so lain down, and had opened her arms, repeating the lesson the grass had whispered to her. So, if she could find nothing with which to reproach herself, it must be that the garden was betraying and torturing her, simply for the pleasure of seeing her suffer.","At that moment Albine was still wandering about the Paradou with all the mute agony of a wounded animal. She had ceased to weep. Her face was very white and a deep crease showed upon her brow. Why did she have to suffer that deathlike agony? Of what fault had she been guilty, that the garden no longer kept the promises it had held out to her since her childhood's days? She questioned herself as she walked along, never heeding the avenues through which the gloom was slowly stealing. She had always obeyed the voices of the trees. She could not remember having injured a single flower. She had ever been the beloved daughter of the greenery, hearkening to it submissively, yielding to it with full belief in the happiness which it promised to her. And when, on that supreme day, the Paradou had cried to her to cast herself beneath the giant-tree, she had done so in compliance with its voice. If she then had nothing to reproach herself with, it must be the garden which had betrayed her; the garden which was torturing her for the mere sake of seeing her suffer."
"— Laissez donc ! Est-ce que ça a besoin d’être béni, ce trou à cochons ! Pour ce qu’ils vont y faire de propre, dans leur chambre !… Encore un usage que vous devriez abolir.

"Le lendemain, sans avoir ajouté un mot, ils sortirent. Ils montèrent à gauche, derrière la grotte où dormait la femme de marbre. Comme ils posaient le pied sur les premières pierres, Serge dit :","The next day, without having added a word, they left. They went up to the left, behind the grotto where the marble woman slept. As they set foot on the first stones, Serge said:","The next day, without any further word on the subject, they went out.

"Et, quand le docteur fut parti, il se rassit au chevet de la morte, et reprit gravement la lecture de son livre.","And, when the doctor had gone, he sat down again at the bedside of the dead woman, and gravely resumed reading his book.","And when the doctor had gone, he sat down again at the bedside of the dead girl, and gravely began to read once more.","And, when the doctor had left, he again sat down by the dead girl's side, and gravely resumed the perusal of his book."

"— Grande enfant ! reprit-il avec un rire. As-tu donc peur que je ne te garde rancune du don que tu m’as fait ? Va, ce ne peut être une faute. Nous nous sommes aimés comme nous devions nous aimer… Je voudrais baiser les empreintes que tes pas ont laissées, lorsque tu m’as amené ici, de même que je baise tes lèvres qui m’ont tenté, de même que je baise tes seins qui viennent d’achever la cure, commencée, tu te souviens ? par tes petites mains fraîches.","- Big child! he resumed with a laugh. Are you afraid that I will hold a grudge against you for the gift you have given me? Go, it can't be a fault. We loved each other as we had to love each other… I would like to kiss the footprints that your footsteps left, when you brought me here, just as I kiss your lips that tempted me, just as I kiss your breasts that just finished the cure, started, remember? by your cool little hands.","‘Silly girl!’ he went on, with a laugh. ‘Are you afraid I’ll bear you a grudge for the gift you have made me? Come on, this cannot be a sin. We have loved each other as we were meant to love each other... I’d like to kiss the prints made by your feet as you brought me here, just as I kiss your lips that tempted me, and as I kiss your breasts which have just completed the cure begun —  do you remember? — by your little, cool hands.’","'Foolish child!' he said, laughing; 'are you afraid that I shall be angry with you for your love? We have loved as we were meant to love. Let me kiss you.'"
"La chambre de l’abbé Mouret, située à un angle du presbytère, était une vaste pièce, trouée sur deux de ses faces de deux immenses fenêtres carrées ; l’une de ces fenêtres s’ouvrait au-dessus de la basse-cour de Désirée ; l’autre donnait sur le village des Artaud, avec la vallée au loin, les collines, tout l’horizon. Le lit tendu de rideaux jaunes, la commode de noyer, les trois chaises de paille, se perdaient sous le haut plafond à solives blanchies. Une légère âpreté, cette odeur un peu aigre des vieilles bâtisses campagnardes, montait du carreau, passé au rouge, luisant comme une glace. Sur la commode, une grande statuette de l’Immaculée Conception mettait une douceur grise, entre deux pots de faïence que la Teuse avait emplis de lilas blancs.","Abbé Mouret's bedroom, situated at a corner of the presbytery, was a vast room, pierced on two sides by two immense square windows; one of these windows looked out over Désirée's poultry yard; the other overlooked the village of Artaud, with the valley in the distance, the hills, the whole horizon. The bed hung with yellow curtains, the walnut chest of drawers, the three straw chairs, were lost under the high ceiling with whitewashed joists. A slight harshness, that slightly sour smell of old country buildings, rose from the tiles, turned red, glistening like ice. On the chest of drawers a large statuette of the Immaculate Conception placed a gray sweetness between two earthenware pots which La Teuse had filled with white lilacs.","Abbé Mouret’s room, on one corner of the presbytery, was enormous, with two huge square windows, one on each side; one of the windows looked out on to Désirée’s farmyard, and the other over the village of Les Artaud, with the valley in the distance, the hills, and the whole horizon. The bed with its yellow curtains, the walnut chest of drawers, and the three chairs with straw seats, seemed quite lost beneath the high ceiling with its whitewashed beams. A slightly acrid odour, that rather sour smell of old country buildings, rose from the red-polished tiles that shone like glass. On the chest of drawers a big statuette of the Immaculate Conception added a gentle, grey note between two earthenware pots that La Teuse had filled with white lilac.","Abbe Mouret's bedroom, which occupied a corner of the vicarage, was a spacious one, having two large square windows; one of which opened above Desiree's farmyard, whilst the other overlooked the village, the valley beyond, the belt of hills, the whole landscape. The yellow-curtained bed, the walnut chest of drawers, and the three straw-bottomed chairs seemed lost below that lofty ceiling with whitewashed joists. A faint tartness, the somewhat musty odour of old country houses, ascended from the tiled and ruddled floor that glistened like a mirror. On the chest of drawers a tall statuette of the Immaculate Conception rose greyly between some porcelain vases which La Teuse had filled with white lilac."
"Elle s’assoupissait lentement. Un instant, elle tint ses yeux grands ouverts, ayant l’air de chercher quel plaisir elle ignorait. Puis, elle baissa les paupières, avec un sourire tranquille, comme pleinement contentée. Elle paraissait dormir, lorsque, au bout de quelques minutes, elle rouvrit les yeux, disant :","She was dozing off slowly. For a moment she held her eyes wide open, looking for what pleasure she was ignoring. Then, she lowered her eyelids, with a calm smile, as if fully contented. She seemed to be asleep when, after a few minutes, she opened her eyes, saying:","She was slowly dozing off. For a moment, she kept her eyes wide open, as if searching for some pleasure she did not know. Then she lowered her eyelids with a peaceful sigh, as if fully satisfied. She seemed to be sleeping, when, after a few minutes, she opened her eyes again and said:","She was gradually dozing off. For a moment she opened her eyes widely, as though she were looking for something, and then her eyelids fell with a tranquil smile of content. She seemed to be asleep, but after a few minutes she opened her eyes again, and said:"
"Rosalie, voyant comment tournait la démarche du curé, crut devoir s’enfoncer les poings dans les yeux en geignant. Elle se laissa même tomber par terre, montrant ses bas bleus qui lui montaient au-dessus des genoux.","Rosalie, seeing how the priest's gait was turning, thought she should press her fists into her eyes, moaning. She even dropped to the ground, showing her blue stockings that went above her knees.","Rosalie, seeing which way the priest’s intervention was going, decided to press her fists into her eyes, and moan. She even let herself fall to the ground, showing her blue stockings which went up even above her knees.","Rosalie, perceiving the turn the priest's application was taking, now thought it proper to ram her fists into her eyes and whimper. And she even let herself fall upon the ground."
"Puis, orgueilleusement, montrant la basse-cour à son frère, elle ajouta :","Then proudly pointing out the barnyard to her brother, she added:","Then pointing to the farmyard, she added with pride ‘Just see how clean it is!’","Then, calling her brother's attention to the yard, she proudly added: 'See, how clean it is!'"
"Ce soir-là, l’abbé Mouret resta plus d’une heure agenouillé dans l’église vide. Les mains jointes, les regards sur la Vierge d’or se levant comme un astre au milieu des verdures, il cherchait l’assoupissement de l’extase, l’apaisement des troubles étranges qu’il avait éprouvés pendant la journée. Mais il ne glissait pas au demi-sommeil de la prière avec l’aisance heureuse qui lui était accoutumée. La maternité de Marie, toute glorieuse et pure qu’elle se révélât, cette taille ronde de femme faite, cet enfant nu qu’elle portait sur un bras, l’inquiétaient, lui semblaient continuer au ciel la poussée débordante de génération au milieu de laquelle il marchait depuis le matin. Comme les vignes des coteaux pierreux, comme les arbres du Paradou, comme le troupeau humain des Artaud, Marie apportait l’éclosion, engendrait la vie. Et la prière s’attardait sur ses lèvres, il s’oubliait à des distractions, voyant des choses qu’il n’avait point encore vues, la courbe molle des cheveux châtains, le léger gonflement du menton, barbouillé de rose. Alors, elle devait se faire plus sévère, l’anéantir sous l’éclat de sa toute-puissance, pour le ramener à la phrase de l’oraison interrompue. Ce fut enfin par sa couronne d’or, par son manteau d’or, par tout l’or qui la changeait en une princesse terrible, qu’elle acheva de l’écraser dans une soumission d’esclave, la prière coulant régulière de la bouche, l’esprit perdu au fond d’une adoration unique. Jusqu’à onze heures, il dormit éveillé de cet engourdissement extatique, ne sentant plus ses genoux, se croyant suspendu, balancé ainsi qu’un enfant qu’on endort, se laissant aller à ce repos, tout en gardant la conscience d’un poids qui lui alourdissait le cœur. Autour de lui, l’église s’emplissait d’ombre, la lampe charbonnait, les hauts feuillages assombrissaient le visage verni de la grande Vierge.","That evening, Father Mouret remained kneeling for more than an hour in the empty church. Hands clasped, gazing at the Golden Virgin rising like a star amid the greenery, he sought the drowsiness of ecstasy, the appeasement of the strange troubles he had experienced during the day. But he did not slip into the half-sleep of prayer with the happy ease which was accustomed to him. Mary's motherhood, however glorious and pure she revealed herself to be, that round figure of a mature woman, that naked child she carried on one arm, worried her, seemed to her to continue in heaven the overflowing thrust of generation in the midst of which he had been walking since morning. Like the vines of the stony hillsides, like the trees of Paradou, like the human flock of the Artauds, Marie brought about blossoming, engendered life. And the prayer lingered on his lips, he forgot himself in distractions, seeing things he had never seen before, the soft curve of the chestnut hair, the slight swelling of the chin, smeared with pink. So she had to become more severe, annihilate him under the glare of her omnipotence, to bring him back to the phrase of the interrupted prayer. It was finally by her golden crown, by her golden cloak, by all the gold that changed her into a terrible princess, that she finished crushing her into the submission of a slave, the prayer flowing regularly from the mouth, the spirit lost in the depths of a single adoration. Until eleven o'clock he slept awake from this ecstatic numbness, no longer feeling his knees, believing himself suspended, swaying like a child that one puts to sleep, letting himself go in this rest, while retaining the consciousness of a weight that weighed down his heart. Around him the church was filled with shadow, the lamp was burning, the high foliage darkened the varnished face of the great Virgin.","That evening, Abbé Mouret stayed kneeling in the empty church for more than an hour. With hands clasped together, and eyes fixed on the gold Virgin, who rose like a star in the midst of the greenery, he sought to lull his ecstasy, and calm the strange disturbances he had felt that day. But he did not slide into the half-sleep of prayer with his usual happy ease. Mary’s maternity, glorious and pure as it showed itself to be, that rounded figure of mature womanhood, and that naked child she bore on her arm, all worried him, seeming to continue in Heaven that overflowing thrust of generation, in the midst of which he had been walking all that day. Like the vines of the stony hillsides, like the trees of the Paradou, like the human herd of the Artauds, Mary too was associated with birth, and the engendering of life. And his prayer faltered on his lips, he fell prey to distractions, seeing things he hadn’t seen before, the soft curve of the light brown hair, the gentle swell of the pink painted chin. Then she had to become more severe and crush him with the blaze of her omnipotence, to return him to the words of the interrupted prayer. It was through her golden crown, her golden robe, and all the gold that transformed her into a tremendous princess that she at last succeeded in crushing him into a slavish submission, with prayer flowing smoothly from his lips, and his mind lost in the depths of one single adoration. Until eleven o’clock he stayed, half asleep, half awake, in an ecstatic trance, no longer conscious of his knees, feeling as if suspended in mid-air, rocked like a child being lulled to sleep, and yielding to this restfulness while still remaining aware of something heavy weighing on his heart. All around him, the church filled with shadows, the lamp grew smoky, and the greenery on high darkened the painted face of the tall Virgin.","That night Abbe Mouret remained for over an hour on his knees in the empty church. With folded hands and eyes fixed on the golden Virgin rising planet-like amid the verdure, he sought the drowsiness of ecstasy, the appeasement of the strange discomfort he had felt that day. But he failed to find the semi-somnolence of prayer with the delightful ease he knew so well. However glorious and pure Mary might reveal herself, her motherhood, the maturity of her charms, and the bare infant she bore upon her arm, disquieted him. It seemed as if in heaven itself there were a repetition of the exuberant life, through which he had been moving since the morning. Like the vines of the stony slopes, like the trees of the Paradou, like the human troop of Artauds, Mary suggested the blossoming, the begetting of life. Prayer came but slowly to his lips; fancies made his mind wander. He perceived things he had never seen before—the gentle wave of her chestnut hair, the rounded swell of her rosy throat. She had to assume a sterner air and overwhelm him with the splendour of her sovereign power to bring him back to the unfinished sentences of his broken prayer. At last the sight of her golden crown, her golden mantle, all the golden sheen which made of her a mighty princess, reduced him once more to slavish submission, and his prayer again flowed evenly, and his mind became wrapped in worship. In this ecstatic trance, half asleep, half awake, he remained till eleven o'clock, heedless of his aching knees, fancying himself suspended in mid air, rocked to and fro like a child, and yielding to restful slumber, though conscious of some unknown weight that oppressed his heart. Meanwhile the church around him filled with shadows, the lamp grew dim, and the lofty sprays of leafage darkened the tall Virgin's varnished face."

"— Bon, je sais ce que ça veut dire, continua la Teuse. Dans une heure, il sera encore là, sur la pierre, à se donner des coliques… Je m’en vais, parce que je l’ennuie. N’importe, ça n’a guère de bon sens : déjeuner quand les autres dînent, se coucher à l’heure où les poules se lèvent !… Je vous ennuie, n’est-ce pas ? monsieur le curé. Bonsoir.

I’m annoying you, aren’t I, Monsieur le Curé? Goodnight! Go on with you, you’re just not sensible!’","'All right, I know what that means,' continued La Teuse. ' In another hour he will still be on the stones there, giving himself a stomach-ache. I'm off, as I shall only bore him. All the same, I can't see much sense in it, eating one's lunch when others are at dinner, and going to bed when the fowls get up!——I worry you , don't I, your reverence? Good-night. You're not at all reasonable!'"
"— C’est là-bas, murmura-t-elle. Je ne puis pas t’indiquer. Il faut suivre la longue allée, puis on tourne à gauche, et encore à gauche. Nous avons dû passer à côté vingt fois… Va, tu aurais beau chercher, tu ne trouverais pas, si je ne t’y menais par la main. Moi, j’irais tout droit, bien qu’il me soit impossible de t’enseigner le chemin.","""It's over there,"" she whispered. I can't tell you. Follow the long driveway, then turn left, and left again. We must have passed by twenty times... Come on, you could look for it, you wouldn't find it, if I didn't lead you there by the hand. I would go straight, although it is impossible for me to teach you the way.","‘It’s over there,’ she murmured. ‘I can’t tell you exactly. You have to go down the long pathway, then turn to the left, and left again. We must have gone past it a score of times. Anyway, you’d look in vain, you’d never find it if I didn’t take you there myself. I could go straight to it even though I can’t explain to you how to get there.’","Her eyes seemed to be wandering far away: 'It is over yonder,' she murmured at last. ' I cannot explain to you clearly. One has to go down the long avenue, and then to turn to the left, and then again to the left. We must have passed it at least a score of times. You might look for it for ever without finding it, if I didn't go with you to show you. I could find my way to it quite straight, though I could never explain it to you.'"
"— Je t’en prie, ne me dis rien. Je ne veux rien savoir. Cela me tuerait, si tu parlais.","""Please don't tell me anything. I do not want to know anything. It would kill me if you talked.","‘I beg you, don’t tell me. I don’t want to know. If you told me, it would kill me.’","Serge, distracted, laid his fingers on her lips, and stammered: 'Don't tell me anything, I beg you. I want to know nothing of it. It will kill me, if you speak.'"
"— Eh bien ! ce gaillard-là n’en finira donc plus, de se faire encenser ? demanda-t-il à la Teuse, qui revenait de la sacristie.","- Well ! Will this guy never end, getting himself incensed? he asked La Teuse, who was returning from the sacristy.","He went out and walked round his gig and his horse, tethered to one of the presbytery shutters. ‘Will this fellow never be done with smothering himself in incense?’ he asked La Teuse, who was just coming back from the sacristy.","'Will that nephew of mine never have finished censing himself?' he asked of La Teuse, who was just coming out of the vestry."
"— Ah ! Conte-moi les jours où tu m’as aimée. Dis-moi tout… M’aimais-tu, lorsque tu dormais sur ma main ? M’aimais-tu, la fois que je suis tombée du cerisier, et que tu étais en bas, si pâle, les bras tendus ? M’aimais-tu, au milieu des prairies, quand tu me prenais à la taille pour me faire sauter les ruisseaux ?","- Oh! Tell me about the days you loved me. Tell me everything... Did you love me, when you slept on my hand? Did you love me, when I fell from the cherry tree, and you were down there, so pale, with your arms outstretched? Did you love me, in the middle of the meadows, when you took me around the waist to make me jump the streams?","‘Oh! tell me about the days when you loved me. Tell me everything... Did you love me when you fell asleep, resting on my hand? Did you love me that time when I fell out of the cherry tree, and you stood underneath, so pale, with your arms outstretched? Did you love me in the grasslands, when you held me round the waist to help me to jump across the streams?’","'Tell me how long you have loved me. Tell me everything. Did you love me that day when you lay sleeping upon my hand? Did you love me when I fell out of the cherry tree, and you stood beneath it, stretching out your arms to catch me, and looking so pale?

"Le grand Fortuné arrivait, en se dandinant. Les trois filles s’étaient avancées, avec des pincements de lèvres.","Big Fortunate was coming, waddling. The three girls had come forward, pursing their lips.","Big Fortuné came up, swaying his hips. The three girls had come forward, with pursed lips.","Big Fortune now came slouching along. The three girls stepped towards him, with compressed lips."
"— Allons, avancez, reprit la servante, montée de nouveau sur l’escabeau. Il ne faut pas coucher ici… Veux-tu bien baiser l’autel, Miette ? Est-ce que tu t’imagines être dans ton écurie ?… Monsieur le curé, voyez donc ce qu’elles font, là-bas ? Je les entends qui rient comme des crevées.","""Come on, come on,"" resumed the servant, mounting the stepladder again. You mustn't sleep here. Will you kiss the altar, Miette? Do you imagine yourself in your stable?... Monsieur le curé, see what they are doing over there? I hear them laughing like dead people.","‘Come on then, let’s get on,’ said the servant, standing once more on top of the steps. ‘We’re not going to stay here all night... Will you just kiss the altar, Miette! Do you think you’re in your stable?... Monsieur le Curé, can you see what they’re doing, down there? I can hear them laughing like maniacs.’","'Very good; come on, then,' continued the old servant, once more clambering up the steps. ' We can't go to bed here. Just kiss the altar, will you, Miette? Do you fancy you are in your stable? Monsieur le Cure, do just see what they are up to over there! I can hear them laughing like lunatics.'"
"Et elle ajouta, d’un air grave qui feignait de plaisanter :","And she added, with a serious air that pretended to be joking:","And she added gravely, but pretending it was just a joke:","'No; leave me, don't worry me;' and she added in a grave tone, though she tried to feign jocularity: 'you know that I have my tree to look for.'"
— Je t’extermine. C’est Dieu qui le veut. Dieu est dans mon bras.,"""I'm killing you. It is God who wills it. God is in my arm.",‘I’m going to exterminate you. It’s God’s will. God is in my arm!’,I am going to exterminate you. It is God who wills it. God is acting through my arm.'
"— Alexandre devient superbe, dit l’abbé pour faire plaisir à sa sœur.","""Alexander is becoming superb,"" said the abbé, to please his sister.","‘Alexander is getting quite splendid,’ said the priest, to please his sister.","'Alexander is getting splendid,' said the Abbe, to please his sister."
"— Et à qui appartient le Paradou, maintenant ? demanda-t-il.","""And who owns the Paradou now?"" he asked.","‘And to whom does it belong now, the Paradou?’ he asked.","'And whom does the Paradou belong to now?' 'Why, nobody knows,' the doctor answered. '"
"— Au revoir, mignonne !… Tu es joliment grande, pour nous saluer comme ça.","- Goodbye, cute! ... You're pretty tall, to greet us like that.","Then he too shouted: ‘Au revoir, my dear!... You’re a really tall girl to be waving to us like that!’","'Good-bye, my pet! How tall you must be to bow like that.'"
Et se tournant de nouveau vers Jeanbernat :,And turning again to Jeanbernat:,Then turning once more to Jeanbernat:,"Then again, turning to Jeanbernat, he yelled: '"
"— Non, j’ai plus de fièvre que toi, je te brûlerais… Écoute, si je n’avais pas peur de te faire du mal, je te prendrais dans mes bras, si fort, si fort, que nous ne sentirions plus nos souffrances.","— No, I have more fever than you, I would burn you… Listen, if I weren't afraid of hurting you, I would take you in my arms, so strong, so strong, that we would no longer feel our sufferings.","‘No, I’m more feverish than you, I’d burn you. Listen, if I weren’t afraid of hurting you, I would take you in my arms and hold you so tight, so tight that we’d no longer feel all this suffering.’","Then, as she renewed her request, he dropped upon his knees, a little distance away, and said, softly: 'No, I am more feverish even than you are; I should make you hot. If I wasn't afraid of hurting you, I would take you in my arms, and clasp you so tightly that we should no longer feel any pain.'"
"— Et ça présente à l’autel de la Vierge ! bégaya-t-elle, en poussant les verrous. Les autres ne valent pas mieux, je le sais bien. Toutes des gourgandines qui sont venues ce soir, avec leurs fagots, histoire de rire et de se faire embrasser par les garçons, à la sortie ! Demain, pas une ne se dérangera ; monsieur le curé pourra bien dire ses Ave tout seul… On n’apercevra plus que les gueuses qui auront des rendez-vous.","""And that presents at the altar of the Virgin!"" she stammered, pushing the locks open. The others are no better, I know that. All of the gourgandines who came this evening, with their fagots, just to laugh and to be kissed by the boys, at the exit! Tomorrow, not one will bother; Monsieur le Curé will be able to say his Ave all by himself… We will only see the beggars who will have appointments.","‘And that creature has the gall to present herself at the altar of the Virgin!’ she stammered, as she shot the bolts. ‘ And I know the others are no better. They’re all sluts, they came this evening with their branches just for a bit of fun, and to get kissed by the boys afterwards. Tomorrow not a single one of them will come; Monsieur le Curé can say his Ave Marias by himself... We shall only see the hussies who are meeting someone.’","'To think that such creatures dare to come to our Lady's altar!' La Teuse stuttered as she shot the bolts. ' The others are no better, I am sure. If they came to-night with their boughs, it was only for a bit of fun and to get kissed by the lads on going off! Not one of them will put herself out of the way to-morrow; his reverence will have to say his Aves by himself——We shall only see the jades who have got assignations.'"
— Voilà monsieur le curé ! crièrent tous les Bambousse et tous les Brichet attablés.,"""Here is Monsieur le Cure!"" shouted all the Bambousses and all the Brichets at the table.",‘Here’s Monsieur le Curé!’ cried all the Bambousses and Brichets sitting at the table.,'Ah! here is Monsieur le Cure!' cried all the company of Bambousses and Brichets as Serge entered.
"— Tais-toi, laisse-moi dire. Je t’ai toujours aimée… Et toi, m’aimais-tu ? M’aimais-tu ?","""Shut up, let me say. I have always loved you… And you, did you love me?

And you, did you love me; did you?'"
"— Là, vous voilà déjà parti !… Mais vous m’écouterez. Vous savez que je n’aime guère les gens de là-bas, n’est-ce pas ? Si je vous parle d’eux, c’est pour votre bien… On prétend que je suis jalouse. Eh bien, je rêve de vous mener un jour là-bas. Vous seriez avec moi, vous ne craindriez pas de mal faire… Voulez-vous ?","""There, you've already left!... But you'll listen to me."" You know I don't like the people there, don't you? If I talk to you about them, it's for your good... They say I'm jealous. Well, I dream of taking you there one day. You would be with me, you wouldn't be afraid of doing wrong… Would you?","‘There you go, running away again!... But you’re going to listen to me. You know I’m not fond of those people over there, don’t you? If I talk to you about them, it’s for your sake... Some say I’m jealous. Well in fact, I’m just longing to take you there one day. As you’d be with me, you’d have no fear of doing anything bad... Do you want to do that?’","'There, you see, you want to be off already! But you are going to listen to me. You know quite well that I am not over fond of the people yonder, don't you? If I talk to you about them, it is for your own good. Some people say that I am jealous. Well, one day I mean to take you over there. You would be with me, and you wouldn't be afraid of any harm happening. Will you go?'"
"— Voyons, dit-elle, jouons-nous, à la fin ?","'Come now,' she said, 'shall we play at the end?","‘Well, then,’ she said, ‘are we going to play cards or not?’","'Come!' she said, 'are we to have our game to-night?'"
II.,II.,Chapter II,II
"Ils entrèrent dans la pièce voisine, un salon de campagne, tapissé d’un papier à grandes fleurs grises d’éteintes, meublé de quatre fauteuils et d’un canapé tendus d’une étoffe de crin. Sur le canapé, Désirée dormait, jetée tout de son long, la tête soutenue par ses deux poings fermés. Ses jupes pendaient, lui découvrant les genoux ; tandis que ses bras levés, nus jusqu’aux coudes, remontaient les lignes puissantes de la gorge. Elle avait un souffle un peu fort, entre ses lèvres rouges entr’ouvertes, montrant les dents.","They entered the adjoining room, a country drawing-room, upholstered in paper with large gray faded flowers, furnished with four armchairs and a sofa upholstered in horsehair. Desiree was sleeping on the couch, thrown to her full length, her head supported by her two clenched fists. Her skirts hung down, baring her knees; while her raised arms, bare to the elbows, swept up the powerful lines of her throat. She breathed a little loudly between her half-open red lips, showing her teeth.","They went into the next room, a rustic living room, with a wallpaper of large grey, faded flowers, and for furniture, four armchairs and a sofa covered in a horsehair material. On the sofa Désirée lay asleep, stretched out full length, with her head resting on her clenched fists. Her skirts were hanging down, leaving her knees bare, while her raised arms, bare to the elbows, emphasized the strong curve of her bosom. She was breathing quite heavily, through her red lips, which, slightly parted, showed her teeth.","They went into the next room, a country drawing-room, hung with faded wall-paper showing large grey flowers, and furnished with four armchairs and a sofa, covered with horse-hair. On the sofa now slept Desiree, stretched out at full length, with her head resting on her clenched hands. The pronounced curve of her bosom was raised somewhat by her upstretched arms, bare to the elbows. She was breathing somewhat heavily, her red lips parted, and thus showing her teeth."
"Puis, quand elle l’eut fait sortir de la chambre, en reculant, elle lui passa un bras à la taille, elle le soutint, à chaque marche. Elle l’amusait, tout en remettant son peigne, lui chatouillait le cou du bout de ses cheveux, ce qui l’empêchait de comprendre qu’il descendait. Mais, en bas, avant qu’elle eût ouvert la porte, il eut peur, dans les ténèbres du corridor.","Then, when she had led him out of the room, stepping back, she put an arm around his waist, supporting him on each step. She amused him, while putting back his comb, tickled his neck with the end of her hair, which prevented him from understanding that he was descending. But downstairs, before she had opened the door, he was afraid, in the darkness of the corridor.","Then when she had got him out of the room, by going before him, backwards, she put an arm round his waist, supporting him over each step. She kept him amused, putting her comb back, and tickling his neck with the ends of her hair, and so preventing him from realizing that he was going down the stairs. But, once down below, even before she had opened the door, he took fright in the darkness of the corridor.","When she had got him out of the room, by retreating before him all the way, she put her arm round his waist and helped him down each stair, amusing him while she put her comb back, even tickling his neck with a lock of her hair, so that he remained unaware that he was going downstairs. But when he was in the hall, he became frightened at the darkness of the passage."
"— Il ne faut jamais pécher, jamais, jamais !","""You must never sin, never, never!""","‘One must never sin, never, never!’","By a supreme effort he had overcome his agony, and though his face was still very pale, he exclaimed in a firm voice, 'One should never sin; never! never!'"
"— Il n’est pas encore remis, dit Lisa. Il a tort de se fatiguer… Tiens ! Fortuné qui pleure !","""He's not recovered yet,"" Lisa said. He's wrong to get tired… Look! Fortune who weeps!","‘He hasn’t recovered yet,’ said Lisa. ‘He’s wrong to tire himself out like this... Look! Fortuné is crying!’","'He hasn't recovered yet,' said Lisa. ' It is wrong of him to fatigue himself. See, there's Fortune crying!'"
"— Et que celui-ci te ferme le bec, calotin ! reprit Jeanbernat, redevenu très calme. Est-il bête, cet animal, avec ses histoires !… Va-t-il falloir que je te casse la tête pour continuer ma route ? Est-ce ton catéchisme qui t’a tourné sur la cervelle ?","""And let this one close your mouth, calotin!"" replied Jeanbernat, who had become very calm again. How stupid is this animal, with its stories!… Am I going to have to break your head to continue my journey? Is it your catechism that turned on your brain?","‘And I hope this one will shut your trap, Holy Joe!’ replied Jeanbernat, now very calm again. ‘How incredibly stupid this animal is, with his stories!... Will I have to crack your skull just to go on my way? Is it your catechism that has turned your brain?’","'And may this one bung your mouth up!' retorted Jeanbernat, who was now quite calm again. ' Is he cracked, the silly fellow, with all those stories of his? . . . Shall I have to break your head for you, before I can get on my way? Is it your catechism that has turned your brain?'"
"Derrière lui, la petite église restait blafarde des pâleurs de la matinée. Le soleil n’était encore qu’au ras des tuiles. Les Kyrie, eleison coururent comme un frisson dans cette sorte d’étable, passée à la chaux, au plafond plat, dont on voyait les poutres badigeonnées. De chaque côté, trois hautes fenêtres, à vitres claires, fêlées, crevées pour la plupart, ouvraient des jours d’une crudité crayeuse. Le plein air du dehors entrait là brutalement, mettant à nu toute la misère du Dieu de ce village perdu. Au fond, au-dessus de la grande porte, qu’on n’ouvrait jamais, et dont des herbes barraient le seuil, une tribune en planches, à laquelle on montait par une échelle de meunier, allait d’une muraille à l’autre, craquant sous les sabots les jours de fête. Près de l’échelle, le confessionnal, aux panneaux disjoints, était peint en jaune citron. En face, à côté de la petite porte, se trouvait le baptistère, un ancien bénitier posé sur un pied en maçonnerie. Puis, à droite et à gauche, au milieu, étaient plaqués deux minces autels, entourés de balustrades de bois. Celui de gauche, consacré à la sainte Vierge, avait une grande Mère de Dieu en plâtre doré, portant royalement une couronne d’or fermée sur ses cheveux châtains ; elle tenait, assis sur son bras gauche, un Jésus, nu et souriant, dont la petite main soulevait le globe étoilé du monde ; elle marchait au milieu de nuages, avec des têtes d’anges ailées sous les pieds. L’autel de droite, où se disaient les messes de mort, était surmonté d’un Christ en carton peint, faisant pendant à la Vierge ; le Christ, de la grandeur d’un enfant de dix ans, agonisait d’une effrayante façon, la tête rejetée en arrière, les côtes saillantes, le ventre creusé, les membres tordus, éclaboussés de sang. Il y avait encore la chaire, une caisse carrée, où l’on montait par un escabeau de cinq degrés, qui s’élevait vis-à-vis d’une horloge à poids, enfermée dans une armoire de noyer, et dont les coups sourds ébranlaient l’église entière, pareils aux battements d’un cœur énorme, caché quelque part, sous les dalles. Tout le long de la nef, les quatorze stations du chemin de la Croix, quatorze images grossièrement enluminées, encadrées de baguettes noires, tachaient du jaune, du bleu et du rouge de la Passion, la blancheur crue des murs.","Behind him, the little church remained pale with the pallor of the morning. The sun was still only level with the tiles. The Kyrie, eleison ran like a shiver through this sort of whitewashed stable, with a flat ceiling, whose whitewashed beams could be seen. On each side, three high windows, with clear panes, cracked, most of them punctured, opened days of chalky crudeness. The open air from outside entered there brutally, laying bare all the misery of the God of this lost village. At the far end, above the great door, which was never opened, and the threshold of which was blocked by grass, a platform made of planks, to which one ascended by a miller's ladder, went from one wall to the another, creaking under the clogs on feast days. Near the ladder, the confessional, with disjointed panels, was painted lemon yellow. Opposite, next to the small door, was the baptistery, an ancient stoup placed on a masonry foot. Then, to the right and to the left, in the middle, were placed two slender altars, surrounded by wooden balustrades. The one on the left, consecrated to the Blessed Virgin, had a large Mother of God in gilded plaster, royally wearing a golden crown closed over her chestnut hair; she held, seated on her left arm, a Jesus, naked and smiling, whose little hand lifted the starry globe of the world; she walked in the midst of clouds, with the heads of winged angels under her feet. The altar on the right, where the death masses were said, was surmounted by a Christ in painted cardboard, as a counterpart to the Virgin; the Christ, the size of a ten-year-old child, was dying in a frightful way, his head thrown back, his ribs protruding, his belly sunken, his limbs twisted and spattered with blood. There was still the pulpit, a square box, which one ascended by a five-step stool, which rose opposite a clock with weights, enclosed in a walnut cabinet, and whose strokes Deaf shook the whole church, like the beating of an enormous heart, hidden somewhere under the flagstones. All along the nave, the fourteen Stations of the Way of the Cross, fourteen crudely illuminated images, framed by black rods, stained the yellow, blue and red of the Passion, the stark whiteness of the walls.","Behind him, the little church looked wan in the pale morning light. The sun had not yet reached the tiles of the roof. The chants of Kyrie Eleison went quivering through the stable-like whitewashed building with its flat ceiling, on which the roughly painted beams were clearly visible. On each side, three tall windows of plain glass, mostly cracked or broken, opened up big patches of harsh, chalky light. The fresh air from outside blew in brutally, laying bare the dire poverty of the God of this desolate village. At the far end, over the main door that was never opened, its threshold blocked by weeds, a rough wooden gallery, reached by an open stair, stretched from one wall to the other, and creaked under the weight of clogs on festival days. Near the steps, the confessional, with its rickety panels, was painted lemon yellow. Opposite, beside the small door, stood the baptismal font, formerly a holy water stoup, mounted on a masonry base. Then, halfway down the church, one on the right and one on the left, stood two narrow altars, with wooden balustrades in front. On the left, the altar dedicated to the Holy Virgin had a large Madonna in gilded plaster, majestically bearing a gold crown upon her chestnut hair; and sitting on her right arm was a baby Jesus, naked and smiling, holding up the starry globe of the world in his little hand. She seemed to be walking with clouds all around her, and the heads of winged angels at her feet. The right-hand altar, where Masses for the dead were said, was surmounted by a Christ in painted pasteboard, making a pair with the figure of the Virgin. The Christ, about the height of a ten-year-old child, was shown dying in terrible agony, with head thrown back, ribs sticking out, hollowed belly, and limbs twisted and spattered with blood. There was also the pulpit, a sort of square platform reached by five steps, standing next to a pendulum clock in a walnut casing, whose dull strokes shook the whole church like the beating of an enormous heart hidden somewhere beneath the paving. Along the nave, the fourteen stations of the Cross, fourteen crudely coloured pictures, framed in black, stained the harsh whiteness of the walls with the yellow, blue, and red of the Passion.","Behind him, the little church still looked wan in the pale light of early morn. The sun, as yet, was only level with the tiled roof. The Kyrie Eleisons rang quiveringly through that sort of whitewashed stable with flat ceiling and bedaubed beams. On either side three lofty windows of plain glass, most of them cracked or smashed, let in a raw light of chalky crudeness. The free air poured in as it listed, emphasising the naked poverty of the God of that forlorn village. At the far end of the church, above the big door which was never opened and the threshold of which was green with weeds, a boarded gallery—reached by a common miller's ladder —stretched from wall to wall. Dire were its creakings on festival days beneath the weight of wooden shoes. Near the ladder stood the confessional, with warped panels, painted a lemon yellow. Facing it, beside the little door, stood the font—a former holy-water stoup resting on a stonework pedestal. To the right and to the left, halfway down the church, two narrow altars stood against the wall, surrounded by wooden balustrades. On the left-hand one, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, was a large gilded plaster statue of the Mother of God, wearing a regal gold crown upon her chestnut hair; while on her left arm sat the Divine Child, nude and smiling, whose little hand raised the star-spangled orb of the universe. The Virgin's feet were poised on clouds, and beneath them peeped the heads of winged cherubs. Then the right-hand altar, used for the masses for the dead, was surmounted by a crucifix of painted papier-mache—a pendant, as it were, to the Virgin's effigy. The figure of Christ, as large as a child of ten years old, showed Him in all the horror of His death-throes, with head thrown back, ribs projecting, abdomen hollowed in, and limbs distorted and splashed with blood. There was a pulpit, too—a square box reached by a five-step block—near a clock with running weights, in a walnut case, whose thuds shook the whole church like the beatings of some huge heart concealed, it might be, under the stone flags. All along the nave the fourteen Stations of the Cross, fourteen coarsely coloured prints in narrow black frames, bespeckled the staring whiteness of the walls with the yellow, blue, and scarlet of scenes from the Passion."
"Désirée avait alors vingt-deux ans. Grandie à la campagne, chez sa nourrice, une paysanne de Saint-Eutrope, elle avait poussé en plein fumier. Le cerveau vide, sans pensées graves d’aucune sorte, elle profitait du sol gras, du plein air de la campagne, se développant toute en chair, devenant une belle bête, fraîche, blanche, au sang rose, à la peau ferme. C’était comme une ânesse de race qui aurait eu le don du rire. Bien que pataugeant du matin au soir, elle gardait ses attaches fines, les lignes souples de ses reins, l’affinement bourgeois de son corps de vierge ; si bien qu’elle était une créature à part, ni demoiselle, ni paysanne, une fille nourrie de la terre, avec une ampleur d’épaules et un front borné de jeune déesse.","Désirée was then twenty-two years old. Grown up in the country, with her nanny, a peasant from Saint-Eutrope, she had grown up in the middle of a dunghill. Empty-brained, with no serious thoughts of any kind, she enjoyed the rich soil, the open air of the countryside, developing into flesh, becoming a beautiful animal, fresh, white, with pink blood, firm skin. She was like a purebred donkey who had the gift of laughter. Although floundering from morning to evening, she kept her fine attachments, the supple lines of her loins, the bourgeois refinement of her virgin body; so much so that she was a creature apart, neither damsel nor peasant, a girl nurtured by the earth, with the breadth of shoulders and the narrow forehead of a young goddess.","Désirée was then twenty-two years old. Raised in the country with her wet nurse, a peasant from Saint-Eutrope, she had grown up in the muck of the farmyard. With an empty mind, no serious thoughts of any kind, she simply thrived on the rich soil and the open air of the country, developing only in the flesh, becoming a lovely animal, fresh and white, with pink cheeks and firm skin. She was rather like a pedigree she-ass, endowed with the gift of laughter. Despite squelching around from dawn to dusk, she still kept her delicate limbs, the supple curves of her hips, the bourgeois refinement of her virginal body; she was indeed a special creature, neither lady nor peasant, a girl nourished by the earth itself, with the broad shoulders and the narrow brow of a young goddess.","Desiree was then twenty-two years old. Reared in the country by her nurse, a peasant woman of Saint-Eutrope, she had grown up anyhow. Her brain void of all serious thoughts, she had thriven on the fat soil and open air of the country, developing physically but never mentally, growing into a lovely animal—white, with rosy blood and firm skin. She was not unlike a high-bred donkey endowed with the power of laughter. Although she dabbled about from morning till night, her delicate hands and feet, the supple outlines of her hips, the bourgeois refinement of her maiden form remained unimpaired; so that she was in truth a creature apart—neither lady nor peasant—but a girl nourished by the soil, with the broad shoulders and narrow brow of a youthful goddess."
"Il s’était redressé, avec une flamme dans les yeux. Il quitta l’autel, invincible désormais, embrasé d’une telle foi, qu’il méprisait les dangers de la tentation. Et il prit la main d’Albine, il la tutoya comme une sœur, il l’emmena devant les images douloureuses du chemin de la Croix.","He straightened up, with a flame in his eyes. He left the altar, now invincible, ablaze with such faith that he despised the dangers of temptation. And he took Albine's hand, he treated her like a sister, he led her before the painful images of the Way of the Cross.","He had stood up, his eyes ablaze. He left the altar, invincible now, burning with such faith that he no longer feared the dangers of temptation. He took Albine’s hand, speaking to her in the familiar tu form, as if she were his sister, and led her over to the distressing pictures of the stations of the Cross.","He had now drawn himself quite erect, with flashing eyes. And feeling that he was now invincible, so permeated with faith as to disdain temptation, he quitted the altar, took Albine's hand, and led her, as though she had been his sister, to the ghastly pictures of the Stations of the Cross."
"Et quand ils furent las des abricotiers, des pruniers, des cerisiers, ils coururent sous les amandiers grêles, mangeant les amandes vertes, à peine grosses comme des pois, cherchant les fraises parmi le tapis d’herbe, se fâchant de ce que les pastèques et les melons n’étaient pas mûrs. Albine finit par courir de toutes ses forces, suivie de Serge, qui ne pouvait l’attraper. Elle s’engagea dans les figuiers, sautant les grosses branches, arrachant les feuilles qu’elle jetait par-derrière à la figure de son compagnon. En quelques bonds, elle traversa les bouquets d’arbousiers, dont elle goûta en passant les baies rouges ; et ce fut dans la futaie des aliziers, des azeroliers et des jujubiers que Serge la perdit. Il la crut d’abord cachée derrière un grenadier ; mais c’était deux fleurs en bouton qu’il avait pris pour les deux nœuds roses de ses poignées. Alors, il battit le bois d’orangers, ravi du beau temps qu’il faisait là, s’imaginant entrer chez les fées du soleil. Au milieu du bois, il aperçut Albine qui, ne le croyant pas si près d’elle, furetait vivement, fouillait du regard les profondeurs vertes.","And when they were tired of the apricot trees, the plum trees, the cherry trees, they ran under the slender almond trees, eating the green almonds, barely as big as peas, looking for the strawberries among the carpet of grass, getting angry that the watermelons and the melons were not ripe. Albine ended up running with all her might, followed by Serge, who couldn't catch her. She entered the fig trees, jumping over the large branches, tearing off the leaves which she threw behind in her companion's face. In a few leaps she crossed the clumps of arbutus, of which she tasted the red berries as she passed; and it was in the forest of trade wind trees, azero trees and jujube trees that Serge lost her. At first he thought she was hiding behind a pomegranate tree; but it was two flower buds that he had taken for the two pink bows on his handles. So he walked through the orange grove, delighted with the fine weather there, imagining himself entering the house of the fairies of the sun. In the middle of the wood he saw Albine who, not believing him so close to her, was ferreting about, searching the green depths with her eyes.","When they were tired of the apricot trees, the plum trees and cherry trees, they ran beneath the spindly almond trees, eating green almonds, scarcely the size of peas, and searching for strawberries in the carpet of grass, annoyed that the melons and watermelons were not ripe. Albine at last ran off as fast as she could, followed by Serge who was unable to catch her. She went in among the fig trees, jumping over thick branches and tearing off leaves that she threw behind her into her companion’s face. In a few bounds she went through the clumps of arbutus, tasting their red berries as she went by, and it was in the forest of sorbs, azaroles, and jujube trees that Serge lost her. At first he thought she was hiding behind a pomegranate tree; but what he had taken to be the two pink rosettes of her wrists were two flowers still in bud. He then searched the wood of orange trees, marvelling at how lovely it was in there, and thinking he was in the fairyland of the sun. In the middle of the wood he found Albine, who, not knowing he was so near, was vigorously rummaging and peering into the green depths.","And when they had grown weary of the apricot-trees and the plum-trees and the cherry-trees, they ran beneath the slender almond-trees; eating green almonds, scarcely yet as big as peas, hunting for strawberries in the grassy carpet, and regretting that the melons were not already ripe. Albine finished by running as fast as she could go, pursued by Serge, who was unable to overtake her. She rushed amongst the fig-trees, leaping over their heavy branches, and pulling off the leaves to throw them behind her in her companion's face. In a few strides she had cleared the clumps of arbutus, whose red berries she tasted on her way; and it was in the jungle of nettle-trees, medlars, and jujube-trees that Serge lost her. At first he thought she was hiding behind a pomegranate; but found that he had mistaken two clustering blossoms for the rosy roundness of her wrists. Then he scoured the plantation of orange-trees, rejoicing in their beauty and perfume, and thinking that he must have reached the abode of the fairies of the sun. In the midst of them he caught sight of Albine, who, not believing him so near her, was peering inquisitively into the green depths."
"— Je savais bien qu’une bête courait là derrière, dit le prêtre.","""I knew a beast was running behind there,"" said the priest.","‘I knew there was some animal running behind there,’ said the priest.","'I knew some animal was running behind,' said the priest."
"Il ne répondit pas. Il s’était assis à califourchon sur une chaise, il faisait le tour de la table en galopant.","He didn't answer. He had sat astride a chair, he was galloping around the table.",He did not answer. He was sitting astride a chair on which he was galloping round the table.,"He made no reply, bestriding a chair and galloping round the table on it."
"Comme Albine le regardait toute surprise, fâchée de voir son histoire connue, il continua à demi-voix, étonné lui-même.","As Albine looked at him in surprise, annoyed to see his story known, he continued in an undertone, astonished himself.","As Albine looked at him in surprise, irritated to find her story already known, he went on quietly, himself astonished:","Then, as Albine looked at him in surprise, somewhat annoyed to find that he knew her story already, he added in a low voice, apparently a little astonished himself: '"
"La grande enfant baissa encore la voix. Elle jetait des coups d’œil furtifs sur l’église, murmurant :","The big child lowered her voice again. She cast furtive glances at the church, murmuring:","Désirée, the grown-up child, again lowered her voice. She cast furtive glances at the church, and whispered:","'I want to see Serge,' said Albine, simply. Desiree cast a hasty glance at the church, and then whispered, 'Yes, yes;"
"Ils gardèrent de nouveau le silence. Et comme continuant à voix haute les réflexions qu’ils faisaient mentalement tous les deux, elle reprit :","They were silent again. And as if continuing aloud the reflections they were both making mentally, she resumed:","They fell silent again. And as if continuing aloud the thoughts they were both thinking, she went on:","They fell into silence again; and then Albine, as though pursuing aloud the reflections which were passing through their minds, exclaimed: 'When he went to see her, he must have gone down yonder path, then past those big chestnut trees, and then under the limes."
"— Oui, murmura Serge, on ne peut pas avoir peur. C’est trop tranquille.","— Yes, murmured Serge, you can't be afraid. It's too quiet.","‘Yes,’ said Serge, ‘you can’t be frightened here. It’s too peaceful.’","'No, indeed,' murmured Serge, 'one could not feel afraid here. It is too peaceful.'"
— Serge ! Serge !,"""Serge!"" Sergi!",‘Serge! Serge!’,'Serge! Serge!'

"L’abbé hésitait. Il entendait à ses oreilles la voix terrible de la Teuse, lui criant que le déjeuner allait être froid. Mais il fut brave, il reprit aussitôt :","The abbot hesitated. He heard in his ears the terrible voice of La Teuse, crying out to him that lunch was going to be cold. But he was brave, he resumed immediately:","The priest hesitated. He could already hear La Teuse’s terrible voice in his ears, shouting that the lunch was going to be cold. But he decided to be brave and said:","The Abbe hesitated; he already seemed to hear La Teuse's terrible voice bawling in his ears that his luncheon was getting cold. But he plucked up courage and added swiftly: 'I'll go with you, uncle."
"— Il n’y a qu’ordure, murmura-t-il, en pliant sa serviette.","""It's just junk,"" he muttered, folding his napkin.","‘There is nothing but filth,’ he murmured as he folded his napkin.","'There is nought but filth,' he muttered as he folded up his napkin."
"— Emmène-moi, dit-elle à voix basse.","""Take me away,"" she said quietly.",‘Take me away.’,"But, dropping her eyelids so that she might not see the tree, she said, in a low whisper, 'Take me away!'"
"Il était de grand matin. Le soleil n’entrait pas encore par les larges fenêtres de l’église. Au-dehors, sur les branches du sorbier, dont la verdure semblait avoir enfoncé les vitres, on entendait le réveil bruyant des moineaux. La Teuse, qui n’avait pas eu le temps de faire le ménage du bon Dieu, époussetait les autels, se haussait sur sa bonne jambe pour essuyer les pieds du Christ barbouillé d’ocre et de laque, rangeait les chaises le plus discrètement possible, s’inclinant, se signant, se frappant la poitrine, suivant la messe, tout en ne perdant pas un seul coup de plumeau. Seule, au pied de la chaire, à quelques pas des époux, la mère Brichet assistait au mariage ; elle priait d’une façon outrée ; elle restait à genoux, avec un balbutiement si fort, que la nef était comme pleine d’un vol de mouches. Et, à l’autre bout, à côté du confessionnal, Catherine tenait sur ses bras un enfant au maillot ; l’enfant s’étant mis à pleurer, elle avait dû tourner le dos à l’autel, le faisant sauter, l’amusant avec la corde de la cloche qui lui pendait juste sur le nez.","It was early in the morning. The sun had not yet entered through the wide windows of the church. Outside, on the branches of the mountain ash, the greenery of which seemed to have broken down the panes, one could hear the noisy awakening of the sparrows. La Teuse, who hadn't had time to do God's housework, dusted the altars, stood on her good leg to wipe the feet of Christ smeared with ocher and lacquer, put away the chairs as discreetly as possible. , bowing, crossing himself, beating his chest, following the mass, while not losing a single stroke of the feather duster. Alone, at the foot of the pulpit, a few paces from the couple, Mother Brichet was present at the wedding; she prayed in an outrageous way; she remained on her knees, stammering so loudly that the nave was as if full of a flight of flies. And, at the other end, beside the confessional, Catherine held in her arms a child in a bathing suit; the child having begun to cry, she had had to turn her back on the altar, making him jump, amusing him with the cord of the bell which hung just over his nose.","It was early morning. The sun had not yet come in through the church’s wide windows. Outside, on the branches of the rowan tree, whose foliage seemed to have pushed its way through the windowpanes, the noisy awakening of the sparrows was making itself heard. La Teuse, who hadn’t had time to do God’s housework, was dusting the altars, stretching up on her good leg to reach the feet of the Christ bedaubed in red and ochre, rearranging the chairs as quietly as possible, bowing, crossing herself, striking her breast, and all the while not missing a single stroke of her feather duster. At the foot of the pulpit, a few steps away from the newly-weds, Mother Brichet, alone, was attending the ceremony; she was praying extravagantly; she stayed on her knees, muttering so loudly that the nave seemed full of a swarm of flies. And at the other end of the church, beside the confessional, Catherine was holding in her arms a child wrapped in a blanket; as the child had begun to cry, she had had to turn her back to the altar, bouncing the baby up and down, and amusing it with the bell rope which was hanging just above its nose.","It was early morning. The sun was not yet shining through the big windows of the church. Outside one could hear the noisy twittering of the sparrows in the branches of the service tree, whose foliage shot through the broken panes. La Teuse, who had not previously had time to clean the church, was now dusting the altar, craning up on her sound leg to wipe the feet of the ochre and lake-bedaubed Christ, and arranging the chairs as quietly as possible; all the while bowing and crossing herself, and following the service, but not omitting a single sweep of her feather broom. Quite alone, at the foot of the pulpit, was mother Brichet, praying in a very demonstrative fashion. She kept on her knees, and repeated the prayers in so loud a whisper that it seemed as if a swarm of bluebottles had taken possession of the nave. At the other end of the church near the confessional, Catherine held an infant in swaddling clothes. As it began to cry, she turned her back upon the altar, and tossed it up, and amused it with the bell-rope, which dangled just over its nose."
"— Je t’aime plus que tout, répondit-il. Tu es plus belle que tout ce que je vois le matin en ouvrant ma fenêtre. Quand je te regarde, tu me suffis. Je voudrais n’avoir que toi, et je serais bien heureux.","""I love you more than anything,"" he replied. You are more beautiful than anything I see in the morning when I open my window. When I look at you, you are enough for me. I would like to have only you, and I would be very happy.","‘I love you more than anything,’ he replied. ‘You are more beautiful than everything I see when I open my window in the morning. When I look at you, you are all I need. If I had nothing at all but you, I’d be perfectly happy.’","'I love you beyond everything,' he answered. ' You are more beautiful than all else that I see when I open my window in the morning. When I look at you, I want nothing more. If I could have you only, I should be perfectly happy.'"
"— C’est ça, je soignerai la vache… Approche, que je t’embrasse, la grande bête ! Tu sens bon, tu sens la santé.","- That's it, I'll take care of the cow... Come closer, let me kiss you, big beast! You smell good, you smell healthy.","‘That’s it, I’ll look after the cow... Come here so I can kiss you, my big animal! You smell good, you smell of health.","All right, my dear, I will attend to your cow. Come and let me kiss you. Ah! how nice and healthy you are!"

"— Oui, murmura-t-il, toute cette ombre, ça vous surprend. On dirait, n’est-ce pas ? Qu’on entre dans quelque chose de si extraordinairement doux, que cela vous fait mal… Mais il faudrait me le dire, si tu avais quelque sujet de tristesse. Je ne t’ai pas contrariée, tu n’es pas fâchée contre moi ?","— Yes, he murmured, all this shadow, it surprises you. Looks like, doesn't it? That one enters into something so extraordinarily sweet, that it hurts you... But you would have to tell me, if you had any cause for sadness. I didn't upset you, aren't you mad at me?","‘Yes,’ came his quiet reply, ‘all this shade, it takes you by surprise. It feels, don’t you think, as if you were going into something so extraordinarily sweet that it hurts... But you must tell me if you’re unhappy about something. I haven’t offended you? You’re not angry with me?’","'Yes,' he murmured, 'all this deep shade affects one. It seems so peaceful, so mournful here that one feels a little sad. But you must tell me, you know, if anything makes you really unhappy. I have not done anything to annoy you, have I? you are not vexed with me?'"
"— Elles ont le diable dans le corps. Elles puent le diable ; elles le puent aux jambes, aux bras, au ventre, partout… C’est ce qui ensorcelle les imbéciles.","""They have the devil in their bodies.""

"Il lui mit un peu de salive, du bout des doigts.","He put a little saliva on her, with his fingertips.",He put a bit of spit on her neck with his fingertip.,Serge wetted his finger and touched her neck with it.
"— Tranquillise-toi, implorait Serge. Il n’y a personne… Te voilà rouge de fièvre. Reposons-nous un instant, je t’en supplie.","— Calm down, begged Serge. There is no one... There you are, red with fever. Let's rest for a moment, please.","‘Calm down,’ Serge begged her. ‘ There’s no one... You’re quite red and feverish. Let’s rest for a moment, I beg you...’","'Calm yourself,' begged Serge, 'there is no one. You are as crimson as though you had a fever. Let us rest here for a moment. Do; I beg you.'"

Vous le voyez bien, à présent… C’est un grand, avec un bâton.","""Leave it, here it is,"" Brother Archangias went on quickly. He just turned his elbow. Here, the moon shines on it. You can see him now... He's a big one with a stick.","‘Stop, stop! there he is,’ Brother Archangias went on. ‘ He’s just come round the bend. Look, the moon is lighting him up. You can see him clearly now... It’s a tall man, with a stick.’","'Stay! stay! there he is,' eagerly added Brother Archangias. ' He has just turned the corner. See! he is in the moonlight now. One can see him plainly. It is a tall man, with a stick.'"
"— Oh ! le paresseux ! murmura-t-elle, prise d’ennui, ramassant deux poignées de roses et les jetant sur la face de Serge pour le réveiller.","- Oh ! lazy ! she murmured, bored, picking up two handfuls of roses and throwing them in Serge's face to wake him up.","‘Oh! the lazy boy!’ she murmured, suddenly feeling bored, and gathering two handfuls of roses, she threw them on to Serge’s face to wake him up.","'Oh! the lazy fellow!' she murmured, feeling bored and picking up two handfuls of roses, which she flung in Serge's face to wake him."
— C’est pour le Mois de Marie ?,"""Is it for the Month of Mary?""",‘Is it for the month of Mary?’,"Brother Archangias, who remained alone with the priest, sourly inquired: 'For the month of Mary, eh?'"
"— C’est là que la morte est enterrée, murmura Albine, retombant dans sa rêverie. C’est la joie de s’être assise là qui l’a tuée. L’arbre a une ombre dont le charme fait mourir… Moi, je mourrais volontiers ainsi. Nous nous coucherions aux bras l’un de l’autre ; nous serions morts, personne ne nous trouverait plus.","""That's where the dead woman is buried,"" murmured Albine, falling back into reverie. It was the joy of sitting there that killed her. The tree has a shadow whose charm makes you die... Me, I would gladly die like this. We would lie in each other's arms; we would be dead, no one would find us anymore.","‘That’s where she died, and where she’s buried,’ Albine said quietly, sinking back into her reverie. ‘It was the joy of sitting there that killed her... The shade of the tree is of such delight that one dies of it... I would be quite willing to die like that. We would lie down together in each other’s arms; we would die, and no one would ever find us again.’","'It is there that the dead lady lies buried,' murmured Albine, falling back into her reverie. ' It was the joy of being there that killed her. The tree casts a shade, whose charm is deathly. . . . I would willingly die so. We would clasp one another there, and we would die, and none would ever find us again.'"

"— Tu as raison, cria-t-il. C’est plus amusant que tout. Je t’accompagnerais au bout de la terre, si tu voulais.","“You're right,” he shouted. It's more fun than anything. I would accompany you to the end of the earth, if you wanted.","‘You’re right,’ he cried. ‘It’s nicer than anything. I’d walk with you to the ends of the earth if you wished.’","'You are right,' he said, 'this is really the best. I would walk by your side to the end of the world, if you wished it.'"
"Le cabriolet reprit sa course folle. Il montait avec des cahots inquiétants la route pierreuse des coteaux, qui menait au Paradou. La Teuse était restée toute suffoquée. Frère Archangias ricanait, en fixant sur elle des yeux où flambait une joie farouche. Et elle le poussa, elle faillit le faire tomber, le long des marches du perron.","The convertible resumed its mad dash. He climbed with disquieting jolting the stony hillside road which led to Paradou. La Teuse had remained quite suffocated. Brother Archangias sneered, staring at her with fierce joyful eyes. And she pushed him, she almost made him fall, along the front steps.","The gig resumed its wild race. With alarming jolts, it climbed the rocky hill road that led to the Paradou.

"— Ma vache non plus n’est pas triste comme toi… Tu n’étais pas là, lorsque l’oncle Pascal me l’a donnée, en me faisant promettre d’être sage. Autrement, tu aurais vu comme elle a été contente, quand je l’ai embrassée, la première fois.","""My cow isn't sad like you either...

"— Je t’aime parce que tu es venue. Cela dit tout… Maintenant, nous sommes ensemble, nous nous aimons. Il me semble que je ne vivrais plus, si je ne t’aimais pas.

"— Oui, murmura l’abbé Mouret, c’est un grand scandale… Je cherche justement le père Bambousse pour lui parler de cette affaire.

"En effet, le parc entier les poussait doucement. Derrière eux, il semblait qu’une barrière de buissons se hérissât, pour les empêcher de revenir sur leurs pas ; tandis que, devant eux, le tapis des gazons se déroulait, si aisément, qu’ils ne regardaient même plus à leurs pieds, s’abandonnant aux pentes douces des terrains.","Indeed, the entire park was gently nudging them.

"Elle s’échappa gaiement, s’enferma dans la chambre au plafond bleu. Puis, après avoir laissé Serge frapper deux fois à la porte, elle l’entrebâilla discrètement, le reçut avec une révérence à l’ancienne mode.","She escaped cheerfully, locked herself in the room with the blue ceiling.

"Cette fois, la Rousse faillit tomber à la renverse, tant elle éclata. Elle se laissa aller contre le mur, les poings aux côtes, riant à se crever. Lisa s’était jetée contre elle, se soulageant mieux, en lui prenant aux épaules et aux reins des pincées de chair. Babet avait un rire de bossue, qui passait entre ses lèvres serrées avec un bruit de scie.","This time, the Redhead almost fell backwards, she exploded so much.

She leant back against the wall, holding her ribs with her fists, laughing fit to burst.

"C’était là certainement que devait se trouver l’arbre tant cherché, dont l’ombre procurait la félicité parfaite. Ils le sentaient proche, au charme qui coulait en eux, avec le demi-jour des hautes voûtes. Les arbres leur semblaient des êtres de bonté, pleins de force, pleins de silence, pleins d’immobilité heureuse. Ils les regardaient un à un, ils les aimaient tous, ils attendaient de leur souveraine tranquillité quelque aveu qui les ferait grandir comme eux, dans la joie d’une vie puissante. Les érables, les frênes, les charmes, les cornouillers, étaient un peuple de colosses, une foule d’une douceur fière, des bonshommes héroïques qui vivaient de paix, lorsque la chute d’un d’entre eux aurait suffi pour blesser et tuer tout un coin du bois. Les ormes avaient des corps énormes, des membres gonflés, engorgés de sève, à peine cachés par les bouquets légers de leurs petites feuilles. Les bouleaux, les aunes, avec leurs blancheurs de fille, cambraient des tailles minces, abandonnaient au vent des chevelures de grandes déesses, déjà à moitié métamorphosées en arbres. Les platanes dressaient des torses réguliers, dont la peau lisse, tatouée de rouge, semblait laisser tomber des plaques de peinture écaillée. Les mélèzes, ainsi qu’une bande barbare, descendaient une pente, drapés dans leurs sayons de verdure tissée, parfumés d’un baume fait de résine et d’encens. Et les chênes étaient rois, les chênes immenses, ramassés carrément sur leur ventre trapu, élargissant des bras dominateurs qui prenaient toute la place au soleil ; arbres titans, foudroyés, renversés dans des poses de lutteurs invaincus, dont les membres épars plantaient à eux seuls une forêt entière.","It was certainly there that the long-sought tree was to be found, whose shade procured perfect bliss. They felt him close, in the charm that flowed through them, with the half-light of the high vaults. The trees seemed to them beings of goodness, full of strength, full of silence, full of happy immobility. They looked at them one by one, they loved them all, they expected from their sovereign tranquility some confession that would make them grow like them, in the joy of a powerful life. The maples, the ashes, the hornbeams, the dogwoods, were a people of colossi, a crowd of proud gentleness, heroic fellows who lived in peace, when the fall of one of them would have been enough to wound and kill. a whole corner of the wood. The elms had enormous bodies, swollen limbs, engorged with sap, barely hidden by the light clumps of their little leaves. The birches, the alders, with their girlish whiteness, arched slender figures, abandoned to the wind the hair of tall goddesses, already half metamorphosed into trees. The plane trees erected regular torsos, whose smooth skin, tattooed red, seemed to drop patches of flaking paint. The larches, like a barbarian band, descended a slope, draped in their sayons of woven greenery, perfumed with a balm made of resin and incense. And the oaks were kings, the immense oaks, huddled squarely on their stocky bellies, spreading dominating arms which took up all the space in the sun; titan trees, blasted, overturned in the poses of undefeated fighters, whose scattered limbs alone planted an entire forest.","This, surely, was the place where the sought-after tree must be, the tree whose shade provided perfect bliss. They felt it to be near, by the delight that flowed into them, along with the half-light of the high arches. The trees seemed to be kindly beings, full of strength, full of silence, full of a happy stillness. They looked at them one by one, loving them all, and expecting their majestic tranquillity to reveal some secret that would make them grow like them, in all the joy of a powerful life. The maples, ash trees, hornbeams, and dogwoods were a race of giants, a throng of proud gentleness, kindly heroes who lived in peace, though the fall of just one of them would have been enough to wound and kill a considerable part of the wood. The elms had enormous bodies, with swollen limbs, engorged with sap, scarcely hidden by the light clusters of their little leaves. The birches and alders, in their maidenly whiteness, arched their slim bodies, and cast their hair to the wind, like great goddesses already half changed into trees. The plane trees stood up straight with their smooth torsos, and their sleek skin with its red tattoos seemed to drop off flakes of dried paint. The larches, like a band of savages, made their way down a slope, draped in their tunics of woven greenery, scented with a balm of resin and incense. And the oaks were kings, huge oaks, firmly set on their stocky bodies, sending out conquering arms to occupy all the space in the sun, trees like Titans struck by lightning, thrown back in the postures of unbeaten wrestlers, whose scattered limbs alone sufficed to plant an entire forest.","Here, indeed, if anywhere, must be the much-sought tree, beneath whose shade perfect happiness had made its home. They felt that it was nigh, such was the delight which stole through them amidst the dimness of those mighty arches. The trees seemed to be creatures of kindliness, full of strength and silence and happy restfulness. They looked at them one by one, and they loved them all; and they awaited from their majestic tranquillity some revelation whereby they themselves might grow, expand into the bliss of strong and perfect life. The maples, the ashes, the hornbeams, the cornels, formed a nation of giants, a multitude full of proud gentleness, who lived in peace, knowing that the fall of any one of them would have sufficed to wreck a whole corner of the forest. The elms displayed colossal bodies and limbs full of sap, scarce veiled by light clusters of little leaves. The birches and the alders, delicate as sylphs, swayed their slim figures in the breeze to which they surrendered the foliage that streamed around them like the locks of goddesses already half metamorphosed into trees. The planes shot up regularly with glossy tattooed bark, whence scaly fragments fell. Down a gentle slope descended the larches, resembling a band of barbarians, draped in sayons of woven greenery. But the oaks were the monarchs of all—the mighty oaks, whose sturdy trunks thrust out conquering arms that barred the sun's approach from all around them; Titan-like trees, oft lightning-struck, thrown back in postures like those of unconquered wrestlers, with scattered limbs that alone gave birth to a whole forest."

"Et il restait la tête appuyée, sans bouger un doigt, comme accablé d’une lassitude heureuse. Ses yeux s’étaient lentement ouverts ; sa bouche soufflait légèrement sur l’une de ses mains nues, soulevant le duvet de sa peau blonde.","And he remained with his head propped up, without moving a finger, as if overwhelmed with a happy lassitude.

"Et il y avait des abricotiers patriarches, qui portaient gaillardement leur grand âge, paralysés déjà d’un côté, avec une forêt de bois mort, pareil à un échafaudage de cathédrale, mais si vivants de leur autre moitié, si jeunes, que des pousses tendres faisaient éclater l’écorce rude de toutes parts. Des pruniers vénérables, tout chenus de mousse, grandissaient encore pour aller boire l’ardent soleil, sans qu’une seule de leurs feuilles pâtît. Des cerisiers bâtissaient des villes entières, des maisons à plusieurs étages, jetant des escaliers, établissant des planchers de branches, larges à y loger dix familles. Puis, c’étaient des pommiers, les reins cassés, les membres contournés, comme de grands infirmes, la peau râcheuse, maculée de rouille verte ; des poiriers lisses, dressant une mâture de hautes tiges minces, immense, semblable à l’échappée d’un port, rayant l’horizon de barres brunes ; des pêchers rosâtres, se faisant faire place dans l’écrasement de leurs voisins, par un rire aimable et une poussée lente de belles filles égarées au milieu d’une foule. Certains pieds, anciennement en espaliers, avaient enfoncé les murailles basses qui les soutenaient ; maintenant, ils se débauchaient, libres des treillages dont les lambeaux arrachés pendaient encore à leurs bras ; ils poussaient à leur guise, n’ayant conservé de leur taille particulière que des apparences d’arbres comme il faut, traînant dans le vagabondage les loques de leur habit de gala. Et, à chaque tronc, à chaque branche, d’un arbre à l’autre, couraient des débandades de vigne. Les ceps montaient comme des rires fous, s’accrochaient un instant à quelque nœud élevé, puis repartaient en un jaillissement de rires plus sonores, éclaboussant tous les feuillages de l’ivresse heureuse des pampres. C’était un vert tendre doré de soleil qui allumait d’une pointe d’ivrognerie les têtes ravagées des grands vieillards du verger.","And there were patriarchal apricot trees, who cheerfully carried their old age, already paralyzed on one side, with a forest of dead wood, like the scaffolding of a cathedral, but so alive from their other half, so young, that shoots tender burst the rough bark on all sides. Venerable plum trees, all hoary with moss, were still growing to go and drink the ardent sun, without a single one of their leaves failing. Cherry trees built entire cities, multi-storey houses, throwing up stairs, laying down floors of branches, wide enough to accommodate ten families. Then there were apple trees, their backs broken, their limbs contorted, like great cripples, their skin rough, stained with green rust; smooth pear trees, erecting a mast of tall slender stems, immense, resembling the vista of a port, streaking the horizon with brown bars; pinkish peach trees, making way for themselves in the crush of their neighbours, by a kind laughter and a slow push of beautiful girls lost in the midst of a crowd. Certain feet, formerly in espaliers, had sunk the low walls which supported them; now they were debauching, free from the trellises whose torn shreds still hung from their arms; they grew as they pleased, having retained of their particular stature only the appearance of decent trees, dragging the rags of their gala habit in the vagrancy. And, to each trunk, to each branch, from one tree to another, ran flocks of vines. The vines rose like mad laughter, clinging for a moment to some high knot, then set off again in a burst of more sonorous laughter, splashing all the foliage with the happy intoxication of the vines. It was a soft golden green of the sun which lit up with a hint of drunkenness the ravaged heads of the tall old men in the orchard.","There were patriarchal apricot trees, bearing their great age with fortitude, already paralysed on one side, with a forest of dead wood like the scaffolding of a cathedral, but so lively on the other side, so youthful, that tender shoots were everywhere breaking out through the rough bark. Some venerable plum trees, all hoary with moss, were still stretching up to drink in the blazing sun, without one leaf losing colour. Cherry trees were building whole townships with multistorey houses, flights of stairs, and floors made of branches, big enough to house ten families. Then there were broken-down apple trees like great invalids, their limbs twisted, their gnarled skin stained with patches of green rust; there were smooth pear trees, raising lofty masts of slender branches, like the opening of a port, cutting the horizon with dark stripes; and rosy peach trees, getting space made for them, even in the crush of their neighbours, with a friendly laugh and a gentle push, like pretty girls caught in a crowd. Some trees, formerly espaliered, had pushed through the low walls that supported them, and now were simply having the time of their life, free of the trellises, torn-off strips of which still hung on their arms; they grew just as they pleased, having kept of their former particular shape only the vague look of once well-brought-up trees now dragging the rags of their party clothes into a vagabond life. And vines ran everywhere with wild abandon, round every trunk and every branch from tree to tree. They climbed unstoppable, like fits of wild giggles, hooked themselves for a moment on to some lofty knot, then darted off again with a further outburst of even louder laughter, splashing all the greenery with the intoxicated jollity of their laden branches. It was a tender green, tipped with gold sunlight that lit up the ravaged heads of the grand old men of the orchard with a touch of drunkenness.","And there were patriarchal apricot trees that bore their great age quite bravely. Though decayed on one side, where they showed a perfect scaffolding of dead wood, they were so youthful, so full of life, that, on the other, young shoots were ever bursting through their rough bark. There were cherry trees, that formed complete towns with houses of several stories, that threw out staircases and floors of branches, big enough for half a score of families. Then there were the apple trees, with their limbs twisted like old cripples, with bark gnarled and knotted, and all stained with lichen-growth. There were also smooth pear trees, that shot up mast-like with long slender spars. And there were rosy-blossomed peach-trees that won a place amid this teeming growth as pretty maids do amidst a human crowd by dint of bright smiles and gentle persistence. Some had been formerly trained as espaliers, but they had broken down the low walls which had once supported them, and now spread abroad in wild confusion, freed from the trammels of trellis work, broken fragments of which still adhered to some of their branches. They grew just as they listed, and resembled well-bred trees, once neat and prim, which, having gone astray, now flaunted but vestiges of whilom respectability. And from tree to tree, and from bough to bough, vine branches hung in confusion. They rose like wild laughter, twined for an instant round some lofty knot, then started off again with yet more sonorous mirth, splotching all the foliage with the merry ebriety of their tendrils. Their pale sun-gilt green set a glow of bacchanalianism about the weather-worn heads of the old orchard giants."
"— Sans doute, murmura-t-elle, apitoyée. Est-ce qu’il y a du bon sens !… Voulez-vous que j’ajoute deux œufs sur le plat ? Ce ne serait pas long. Enfin, si vous avez assez… Et tout est froid !

"L’abbé Mouret ne répondait pas. Il préparait le calice sur une petite table, un grand vieux calice d’argent doré, à pied de bronze, qu’il venait de prendre au fond d’une armoire de bois blanc, où étaient enfermés les vases et les linges sacrés, les Saintes Huiles, les Missels, les chandeliers, les croix. Il posa en travers de la coupe un purificatoire propre, mit par-dessus ce linge la patène d’argent doré, contenant une hostie, qu’il recouvrit d’une petite pale de lin.

"Elle tomba, à peine murmurée, comme un souffle musical, un frisson de la chaleur et de la vie. Il y avait quelques jours déjà qu’Albine n’avait plus entendu la voix de Serge. Elle la retrouvait, ainsi que lui, changée. Il lui sembla qu’elle s’élargissait dans le parc avec plus de douceur que la phrase des oiseaux, plus d’autorité que le vent courbant les branches. Elle était reine, elle commandait. Tout le jardin l’entendit, bien qu’elle eût passé comme une haleine, et tout le jardin tressaillit de l’allégresse qu’elle lui apportait.","It fell, barely whispered, like a musical breath, a shiver of warmth and life.

Enfin, il vivait ; il n’était plus cette plante soumise aux agonies de l’hiver. Aussi quelle reconnaissance attendrie ! Il aurait voulu éviter aux petits pieds d’Albine la rudesse des allées ; il rêvait de la pendre à son cou, comme une enfant que sa mère endort. Déjà, il la protégeait en gardien jaloux, écartait les pierres et les ronces, veillait à ce que le vent ne volât pas sur ses cheveux adorés des caresses qui n’appartenaient qu’à lui.

"Huit jours plus tard, il y eut de nouveau un grand voyage dans le parc. Il s’agissait d’aller plus loin que le verger, à gauche, du côté des larges prairies que quatre ruisseaux traversaient. On ferait plusieurs lieues en pleine herbe ; on vivrait de sa pêche, si l’on venait à s’égarer.","Eight days later, there was another big trip to the park. It was a question of going further than the orchard, on the left, on the side of the wide meadows that four streams crossed. We would cover several leagues in the open grass; we would live off our fishing if we were to go astray.","A week later there was another great journey into the park. This time they were to go over to the left beyond the orchard, where there were vast meadows, with four streams flowing through them. They would go several miles over the open grass; if they should happen to get lost, they would live on whatever fish they could catch.","A week later there was another expedition to the park. They had planned to extend their rambles beyond the orchard, striking out to the left through the meadows watered by the four streams. They would travel several miles over the thick grass, and they might live on fish, if they happened to lose themselves."
"Le Frère ayant poussé un grognement, il s’interrompit pour lui crier :","The Brother having let out a grunt, he broke off to shout at him:","When the Brother let out a growl, he paused to shout at him:","And as the Brother broke out into a growl, Jeanbernat cried threateningly: 'If you don't keep still I will cut your ears off at once!'"
"— Dis ? nous sommes deux maintenant, nous chercherons, nous trouverons… Toi qui es fort, tu écarteras les grosses branches devant moi, pour que j’aille jusqu’au fond des fourrés. Tu me porteras, lorsque je serai lasse ; tu m’aideras à sauter les ruisseaux, tu monteras aux arbres, si nous venons à perdre notre route… Et quelle joie, lorsque nous pourrons nous asseoir côte à côte, sous le toit de feuilles, au centre de la clairière ! On m’a raconté qu’on vivait là dans une minute toute une vie… Dis ? mon bon Serge, dès demain, nous partirons, nous battrons le parc broussailles à broussailles, jusqu’à ce que nous ayons contenté notre désir.","- Say ? there are two of us now, we will seek, we will find... You who are strong, you will push aside the large branches in front of me, so that I can go to the bottom of the thickets. You will carry me when I am tired; you will help me to jump the streams, you will climb the trees, if we lose our way... And what joy, when we can sit side by side, under the roof of leaves, in the center of the clearing! I was told that we lived there in a minute a whole life… Say? my good Serge, tomorrow we'll be leaving, we'll beat the park brushwood by brushwood, until we've satisfied our desire.","‘What do you say? Now there are two us, we’ll search together, and we’ll find it... You, who are so strong, you’ll push away the branches for me so that I can get right into the thickets. You’ll carry me when I’m tired, and help me to leap over the streams, and you’ll climb the trees if we happen to lose our way... And what joy it will be, when we can sit side by side under the leafy roof in the middle of that glade! I’ve heard that there you can live a whole lifetime in one minute. So, what do you say, my dear Serge? We shall set off tomorrow, we’ll search the whole park, bush by bush, until we’ve found what we desire.’","She raised her voice, and threw one of her arms round Serge's neck, as she continued: 'Tell me, now; shall we search for it together? We shall surely find it. You, who are strong, will push aside the heavy branches, while I crawl underneath and search the brakes. When I grow weary, you can carry me; you can help me to cross the streams; and if we happen to lose ourselves, you can climb the trees and try to discover our way again. Ah! and how delightful it will be for us to sit, side by side, beneath the green canopy in the centre of the clearing! I have been told that in one minute one may there live the whole of life. Tell me, my dear Serge, shall we set off to-morrow and scour the park, from bush to bush, until we have found what we want?'"
"À ce moment, dans l’église, les voix grandirent, trônèrent sur un ton mourant. Un bruit de pas arriva, très distinct.","At this moment, in the church, the voices grew louder, enthroned in a dying tone. Footsteps came, very distinct.","At that moment, the voices swelled in the church, then lingered on a mournful note. The sound of footsteps could clearly be heard.","At this moment the voices in the church rose yet more loudly, and a sound of steps could be distinctly heard. 'No! no!'"
"Alors, elle se tut, les yeux ardents, serrant les lèvres pour que les paroles n’en jaillissent pas malgré elle. Et elle resta dans la chambre jusqu’au soir, cherchant le regard de Serge, lui confiant un peu de ce qu’elle savait, dès qu’elle parvenait à le rencontrer. Elle avait comme de la lumière sur la face. Elle sentait si bon, elle était si sonore de vie, qu’il la respirait, qu’elle entrait en lui autant par l’ouïe que par la vue. Tous ses sens la buvaient. Et il se défendait désespérément contre cette lente possession de son être.","Then she was silent, her eyes burning, pursing her lips so that the words would not come out in spite of her. And she remained in the room until evening, seeking Serge's gaze, telling him a little of what she knew as soon as she managed to meet him. She had a light on her face. She smelled so good, she was so sonorous with life, that he breathed her in, that she entered him as much by hearing as by sight. All her senses were drinking her in. And he defended himself desperately against this slow possession of his being.","Then she fell silent, her eyes burning, and her lips tightly pressed together to stop the words bursting out in spite of her. And she stayed in the room until evening, trying to catch Serge’s eye, and confiding a little of what she knew when she succeeded in doing so. She seemed to have a sort of light on her face. She smelled so nice, and was so resonant with life that he was breathing her in, and she was getting inside him as much through his hearing as his sight. All his senses were drinking her in. And he tried desperately to defend himself against this slow possession of his whole being.","Then she sank into silence with gleaming eyes and lips tightly pressed lest the words she kept back should spring out in spite of her. And she stayed in the room till evening, trying to meet Serge's glance, and imparting to him, each time that their eyes met, something of that which she had discovered. Her whole face beamed with radiance, she exhaled a delicious odour, she was full of life; and Serge felt that she permeated him through all his senses. Despairingly did he struggle against this gradual invasion of his being."
"— Qu’as-tu ? Tu ne m’as pas baisé sur les joues comme autrefois, tu sais, lorsque tes lèvres chantaient… Va, si tu es souffrant, je te guérirai encore. Maintenant que tu es là, nous allons recommencer notre bonheur. Il n’y a plus de tristesse… Tu vois, je souris. Il faut sourire, Serge.","- What have you ? You didn't kiss me on the cheeks like you used to, you know, when your lips were singing... Go, if you're sick, I'll heal you again. Now that you're here, we're going to start our happiness all over again. There is no more sadness… You see, I smile. You have to smile, Serge.","‘What’s the matter? You didn’t kiss me on the cheeks as you did before, you know, when your lips sang to me... No matter, if you’re sick, I shall cure you again. Now you’re here, we shall begin our happiness again. No more sadness... You see, I’m smiling. You must smile, Serge.’","'What is the matter with you? Why don't you kiss my cheeks as you used to do? Oh! if you are ill, I will cure you once again. Now that you are here, all our old happiness will return. There will be no more wretchedness. . . . See! I am smiling. You must smile, too, Serge.'"
"— Tiens, pourquoi donc ? dit hardiment Rosalie. On ne m’accusera peut-être pas de l’avoir volé.","""Hey, why is that?"" said Rosalie boldly. I may not be accused of stealing it.",‘Why?’ Rosalie boldly asked. ‘I don’t think anyone’s going to accuse me of stealing it!’,said Rosalie boldly. ' You can't say I have stolen it.'
"Cependant Désirée, qui avait, elle aussi, mangé sa soupe, sérieusement, sans ouvrir les lèvres, venait de se lever pour suivre la Teuse à la cuisine. Le Frère, resté seul avec l’abbé Mouret, se taillait de longues bouchées de pain, qu’il avalait, tout en attendant le plat.","Meanwhile Desiree, who had also eaten her soup seriously, without opening her lips, had just got up to follow La Teuse to the kitchen. The Brother, left alone with the Abbé Mouret, cut himself long mouthfuls of bread, which he swallowed while waiting for the dish.","Meanwhile, Désirée, who had also finished her soup quite solemnly, without uttering a word, had got up and followed La Teuse into the kitchen. The Brother, left alone with the abbé, was cutting himself some long slices of bread, which he ate while waiting for the main course.","At this moment Desiree, who also had finished her soup, sedately and in silence, rose and followed La Teuse to the kitchen. The Brother, then left alone with Abbe Mouret, cut himself some long strips of bread, which he ate while waiting for the next dish."
"Le prêtre s’éloignait, lorsque la mère Brichet lui demanda ce qu’était devenu son cadet Vincent, parti depuis le matin pour aller servir la messe. C’était un galopin qui avait bien besoin des conseils de monsieur le curé. Et elle accompagna le prêtre pendant une centaine de pas, se plaignant de sa misère, des pommes de terre qui manquaient, du froid qui avait gelé les oliviers, des chaleurs qui menaçaient de brûler les maigres récoltes. Elle le quitta, en lui affirmant que son fils Fortuné récitait ses prières, matin et soir.","The priest was leaving when Mother Brichet asked him what had become of his younger brother, Vincent, who had left since morning to go and serve mass. He was a rascal who really needed the advice of the priest. And she accompanied the priest for a hundred paces, complaining of his misery, of the lack of potatoes, of the cold which had frozen the olive trees, of the heat which threatened to burn the meager harvests. She left him, telling him that her son Fortuné recited his prayers, morning and evening.","The priest was moving away when Mother Brichet asked him what had become of her youngest, Vincent, who had gone off that morning to serve the Mass. That young scamp really needed the guidance of Monsieur le Curé. And she accompanied the priest for a hundred yards or so, complaining about her poverty, the lack of potatoes, the cold weather that had frozen the olive trees, and the hot weather that threatened to burn their meagre harvests. At last she left, after assuring him that her son Fortuné said his prayers night and morning.","The priest was going off when the mother asked him what had become of her younger son Vincent, who had left in the early morning to serve mass. There was a lad now who badly needed his reverence's admonitions. And she walked by the priest's side for another hundred yards, bemoaning her poverty, the failure of the potato crop, the frost which had nipped the olive trees, the hot weather which threatened to scorch up the scanty corn. Then, as she left him, she solemnly declared that her son Fortune always said his prayers, both morning and evening."
"Il l’écartait lentement. Puis, pendant qu’elle lui embrassait les genoux, il se passa les mains sur la face, comme pour chasser de ses yeux et de son front un reste de sommeil. C’était donc là le monde inconnu, le pays étranger auquel il n’avait jamais songé sans une peur sourde. Où avait-il donc vu ce pays ? De quel rêve s’éveillait-il, pour sentir monter de ses reins une angoisse si poignante, qui grossissait peu à peu dans sa poitrine, jusqu’à l’étouffer ? Le village s’animait du retour des champs. Les hommes rentraient, la veste jetée sur l’épaule, d’un pas de bêtes harassées ; les femmes, au seuil des maisons, avaient des gestes d’appel ; tandis que les enfants, par bandes, poursuivaient les poules à coups de pierre. Dans le cimetière, deux galopins se glissaient, un garçon et une fille, qui marchaient à quatre pattes, le long du petit mur, pour ne pas être vus. Des vols de moineaux se couchaient sous les tuiles de l’église. Une jupe de cotonnade bleue venait d’apparaître sur le perron du presbytère, si large, qu’elle bouchait la porte.","He pushed her away slowly. Then, while she was kissing his knees, he passed his hands over his face, as if to drive from his eyes and forehead a remnant of sleep. This, then, was the unknown world, the foreign land he had never dreamed of without a dull fear. Where had he seen this country? From what dream was he waking, to feel such a poignant anguish rising from his loins, which was growing little by little in his chest, until it suffocated him? The village came alive with the return from the fields. The men returned, their jackets thrown over their shoulders, with the pace of harassed animals; the women, on the thresholds of the houses, made gestures of appeal; while the children, in gangs, pursued the hens with stones. In the cemetery, two urchins slipped, a boy and a girl, who walked on all fours, along the low wall, so as not to be seen. Flocks of sparrows slept under the tiles of the church. A skirt of blue cotton had just appeared on the steps of the presbytery, so wide that it blocked the door.","But he was slowly pushing her aside. Then, while she clasped his knees, he passed his hands over his face, as if to wipe away some remnant of sleep from his eyes and his brow. This, then, was the unknown world, the foreign country of which he had never thought without an indefinable fear. Where then had he seen this country? From what dream was he waking, to feel such piercing anguish rising from his loins and growing steadily in his breast until it threatened to suffocate him? The village was astir with the return from the fields. The men were going home, with coats thrown over their shoulders, moving like weary animals; the women, standing in the doorways, called them on with a wave, while bands of children were throwing stones at the hens. Two little rascals were slipping into the cemetery, a boy and a girl, crawling on all fours alongside the little wall, to avoid being seen. Flights of sparrows were roosting beneath the tiles of the church. A blue cotton skirt had just appeared on the presbytery steps, a skirt so wide that it blocked the whole doorway.","But he put her from him gently. Then, while she fell down and clung to his legs, he passed his hands across his face, as though he were wiping from his brow and eyes some last lingering traces of sleep. It was yonder, then, that lay the unknown world, the strange land of which he had never dreamed without vague fear. Where had he seen that country? From what dream was he awakening, that he felt such keen anguish swelling up in his breast till it almost choked him? The village was breaking out into life at the close of the day's work. The men were coming home from the fields with weary gait, their jackets thrown over their shoulders; the women, standing by their doors, were beckoning to them to hasten on; while the children, in noisy bands, chased the fowls about and pelted them with stones. In the churchyard a couple of scapegraces, a lad and a girl, were creeping along under the shelter of the wall in order to escape notice. Swarms of sparrows were retiring to roost beneath the eaves of the church; and, on the steps of the parsonage, a blue calico skirt had just appeared, of such spreading dimensions as to quite block the doorway."
"— Ah ! Les gourmands ! cria Désirée, ils mangeraient comme cela jusqu’à demain matin !… La nuit, on les entend qui croquent les feuilles oubliées.","- Oh! Gourmands ! cried Désirée, they would eat like this until tomorrow morning!... At night, we hear them crunching the forgotten leaves.","‘Ah, the greedy things!’ cried Désirée, ‘they’d go on eating like that until tomorrow morning!... You can hear them in the night munching the leftover leaves.’","'Oh! the greedy little things!' exclaimed Desiree. ' They would eat like that till to-morrow morning! At night, even, you can bear them crunching the leaves they have overlooked in the day-time.'"
"Serge regardait, malgré lui, cloué au seuil de la brèche. En bas, au fond de la plaine, le soleil couchant éclairait d’une nappe d’or le village des Artaud, pareil à une vision surgissant du crépuscule dont les champs voisins étaient déjà noyés. On distinguait nettement les masures bâties à la débandade le long de la route, les petites cours pleines de fumier, les jardins étroits plantés de légumes. Plus haut, le grand cyprès du cimetière dressait son profil sombre. Et les tuiles rouges de l’église semblaient un brasier, au-dessus duquel la cloche, toute noire, mettait comme un visage d’un dessin délié ; tandis que le vieux presbytère, à côté, ouvrait ses portes et ses fenêtres à l’air du soir.","Serge watched, in spite of himself, nailed to the threshold of the breach. Below, at the bottom of the plain, the setting sun lit up the village of the Artauds with a sheet of gold, like a vision emerging from the twilight in which the neighboring fields were already drowned. You could clearly make out the huts built in disorder along the road, the little courtyards full of manure, the narrow gardens planted with vegetables. Higher up, the great cypress of the cemetery raised its dark profile. And the red tiles of the church looked like a brazier, above which the bell, all black, placed like a face of a delicate design; while the old rectory next door opened its doors and windows to the evening air.","Serge went on looking in spite of himself, standing rooted to the ground in front of the gap. Down below, at the far end of the plain, the setting sun lit up the village of Les Artaud, draping it with gold, like a vision rising out of the dusk that already engulfed the nearby fields. The peasants’ cottages could be clearly seen, scattered higgledy-piggledy along the road, with their little yards full of manure, and tiny gardens planted with vegetables. Higher up, the great cypress in the cemetery showed its sombre outline. And the red tiles of the church were like a brazier, above which the blackness of the bell looked like a face added to an unfinished sketch; while the old presbytery at the side had its doors and windows open to the evening air.","But Serge, in spite of himself, stood rooted to the ground, on the threshold of the breach through which he gazed. Down below, in the depths of the valley, the setting sun cast a sheet of gold upon the village of Les Artaud, which showed vision-like amidst the twilight in which the neighbouring fields were already steeped. One could plainly distinguish the houses that straggled along the high road; the little yards with their dunghills, and the narrow gardens planted with vegetables. Higher up, the tall cypress in the graveyard reared its dusky silhouette, and the red tiles on the church glowed brazier-like, the dark bell looking down on them like a human face, while the old parsonage at the side threw its doors and windows open to the evening air."
"Il la voyait encore là. Elle lui tendait les bras, elle était désirable, à lui faire rompre tous ses serments. Et il se jetait sur sa gorge, sans respect pour l’église ; il lui prenait les membres, il la possédait sous une pluie de baisers. C’était devant elle qu’il se mettait à genoux, implorant sa miséricorde, lui demandant pardon de ses brutalités. Il expliquait qu’à certaines heures, il y avait en lui une voix qui n’était pas la sienne. Est-ce que jamais il l’aurait maltraitée ! La voix étrangère seule avait parlé. Ce ne pouvait être lui, qui n’aurait pas, sans un frisson, touché à un de ses cheveux. Et il l’avait chassée, l’église était bien vide ! Où devait-il courir, pour la rejoindre, pour la ramener, en essuyant ses larmes sous des caresses ? La pluie tombait plus fort. Les chemins étaient des lacs de boue. Il se l’imaginait battue par l’averse, chancelant le long des fossés, avec des jupes trempées, collées à sa peau. Non, non, ce n’était pas lui, c’était l’autre, la voix jalouse, qui avait eu cette cruauté de vouloir la mort de son amour.","He still saw her there. She held out her arms to him, she was desirable, to make him break all his oaths. And he threw himself on his throat, without respect for the church; he took her limbs, he possessed her under a shower of kisses. It was before her that he knelt down, imploring her mercy, asking forgiveness for his brutality. He explained that at certain times there was a voice within him that was not his own. Would he ever have mistreated her! The foreign voice alone had spoken. It couldn't be he, who wouldn't, without a shudder, have touched one of his hairs. And he had chased her away, the church was quite empty! Where should he run, to join her, to bring her back, wiping away her tears under caresses? The rain was falling harder. The paths were mud lakes. He imagined her battered by the downpour, staggering along the ditches, with soaked skirts clinging to her skin. No, no, it was not he, it was the other, the jealous voice, who had had this cruelty to want the death of his love.","He could still see her there. She stretched out her arms to him, she was desirable enough to make him break every one of his vows. And he threw himself upon her breast, with no respect for the church; he seized hold of her limbs, and possessed her under a hail of kisses. It was before her that he knelt, imploring her for mercy, begging forgiveness for his brutality. He explained that at times there was a voice in him that was not his. Would he ever have ill-treated her? It was only that alien voice that had spoken to her. It could not be he, he who would not have touched a hair of her head without trembling. And he had driven her away, the church really was empty! Where should he run to find her again, to bring her back, and dry her tears with his caresses? The rain was falling harder now. The roads were lakes of mud. He imagined her battered by the rain, stumbling along beside the ditches, with her skirts soaked and sticking to her skin. No, no, it was not he, it was that other, that jealous voice, that had been cruel enough to want the death of his love.","He thought he saw her still standing there. She was stretching out her arms to him; she was beautiful enough to make him break all his vows. He threw himself upon her bosom without thought of the reverence due to his surroundings, he clasped her and rained kisses upon her face. It was before her that he now knelt, imploring her mercy, and beseeching her to forgive him his unkindness. He told her that, at times a voice which was not his own spoke through his lips. Could he himself ever have treated her harshly? It was the strange voice that had repulsed her. It could not, surely, be he himself, for he would have been unable to touch a hair of her head without loving emotion. And yet he had driven her away. The church was really empty! Whither should he hasten to find her again, to bring her back, and wipe her tears away with kisses? The rain was streaming down more violently than ever. The roads must be rivers of mud. He pictured her to himself lashed by the downpour, tottering alongside the ditches, her clothes soaked and clinging to her skin. No! no! it could not have been himself; it was that other voice, the jealous voice that had so cruelly sought to slay his love."
"Lui, resta un peu surpris que cela fût fini si vite. Il allongea le bras, la tira par la jupe, comme pour la ramener contre lui. Et elle tomba sur les genoux, riant, répétant :","He was a little surprised that it was over so quickly. He stretched out his arm, pulled her by the skirt, as if to bring her back against him. And she fell on her knees, laughing, repeating:","Serge was rather surprised that it was over so quickly. He stretched out his arm and pulled her by her skirt, to bring her back to him. And she dropped on to her knees, laughing, and repeating: ‘What was that for?","Serge seemed a little surprised at this speedy termination of their sleep. He stretched out his arm and caught hold of Albine, as though to draw her near him again; and when she, laughing, dropped upon her knees he grasped her elbows and gazed up at her."
"Puis, quand elle vit le prêtre, elle fit mine de rougir, elle ramena ses vêtements, les poings de nouveau dans les yeux. Lui, chercha à la consoler, en lui promettant de tenter de nouveaux efforts auprès de son père. Et il ajouta qu’en attendant, elle devait obéir, cesser tout rapport avec Fortuné, ne pas aggraver son péché davantage.","Then, when she saw the priest, she pretended to blush, she pulled her clothes back, her fists in her eyes again. He tried to console her, promising to try new efforts with her father. And he added that in the meantime she must obey, cease all relations with Fortuné, not aggravate her sin any further.","Then when she saw the priest, she pretended to blush, tidied up her clothes, and once more pressed her fists into her eyes.

And he added that in the meantime, she should be obedient and not see Fortuné any more, to avoid making her sin any worse.","When she perceived the priest, she made an attempt at a blush, settled her clothes, and once more raised her fists to her eyes. He, on his part, sought to console her by promising to attempt some fresh efforts with her father, adding that, in the meantime, she should do nothing to aggravate her sin."
"— Et Serge ? demanda-t-elle de sa même voix, nette et entêtée.","""And Sergius?"" she asked in her same voice, clear and stubborn.","‘And Serge?’ she asked, in her firm and stubborn voice.","'And Serge?' she asked again, in the same clear, stubborn voice."
"Elle tendit l’oreille. Un chant de coq venait de la basse-cour, un vacarme grandissait, des battements d’ailes, des grognements, des cris rauques, toute une panique de bêtes effarouchées.","She listened. A rooster crow came from the barnyard, a din grew, beats of wings, growls, hoarse cries, a whole panic of frightened animals.","She suddenly stopped to listen. A cock had just crowed in the farmyard, followed by an increasing uproar of flapping wings, gruntings, and raucous cries, a real panic of startled animals.","She paused to listen. A cock crowed in the yard, and a great uproar followed, with flapping of wings and cackling, grunting, and hoarse cries as if the whole yard were in a state of commotion."
"À chaque heure, il dessinait un nouveau jardin, aux grands rires d’Albine, qui répétait, lorsqu’elle le surprenait :","Every hour he drew a new garden, to the great laughter of Albine, who repeated, when she surprised him:","With each passing hour, he designed a new garden, to the great amusement of Albine who, finding him working on it, would exclaim with great bursts of laughter:","Every hour he designed some new garden, much to the amusement of Albine, who, whenever she surprised him at it, would exclaim with a burst of laughter: '"
"— Elle a raison, dit la Teuse. Vous n’avez pas de bon sens, monsieur le curé ; ce n’est point une existence, de vivre de deux ou trois miettes par jour, comme un oiseau. Vous ne vous faites plus de sang, parbleu ! C’est ça qui vous rend tout pâle… Est-ce que vous n’avez pas honte de rester plus maigre qu’un clou, lorsque nous sommes si grasses, nous autres, qui ne sommes que des femmes ? On doit croire que nous ne vous laissons rien dans les plats.","""She's right,"" said La Teuse. You have no good sense, Monsieur le Curé; it is not an existence to live on two or three crumbs a day, like a bird. You don't worry anymore, damn it! That's what makes you all pale... Aren't you ashamed to stay skinnier than a nail, when we are so fat, us, who are only women? We must believe that we leave you nothing in the dishes.","‘She’s right,’ said La Teuse. ‘It’s only common sense, Monsieur le Curé. It’s no sort of existence for anyone, living like a bird on two or three crumbs of bread a day. You’re not making any new blood for yourself. That’s what makes you so pale... Aren’t you ashamed to be staying thin as a lath when we two, who are only women, are so nice and fat. People must think we eat so much there’s nothing left for you.’","'She is right,' said La Teuse. ' You don't behave reasonably, Monsieur le Cure. You can't expect to be strong, living, as you do, on two or three crumbs a day, as though you were a bird. You don't make blood; and that's why you are so pale. Don't you feel ashamed of keeping as thin as a lath when we are so fat; we who are only women? People will begin to think that we gobble up everything and leave you nothing but the empty plates.'"
"La Teuse restait debout, jalouse, blessée, faisant effort pour se taire ; mais la langue lui démangeait tellement, qu’elle reprit bientôt :","La Teuse remained standing, jealous, hurt, making an effort to be silent; but her tongue itched so much that she soon resumed:","La Teuse remained standing, jealous and hurt, trying hard to keep silent, but her tongue so itched that she soon started up again:","La Teuse remained standing there, feeling jealous and hurt and struggling to keep silence; but so great was the itching of her tongue, that she soon broke out once more: 'Brother Archangias has been here."
"Puis, quand elle eut aperçu son frère dans le jardin, elle accourut, elle s’assit un instant par terre, à ses pieds, le suppliant :","Then, when she saw her brother in the garden, she ran up, she sat down for a moment on the ground, at his feet, imploring him:","she shouted. Then when she spotted her brother down in the garden, she ran to him, and sat on the ground for a moment at his feet, begging him:","she called. And catching sight of her brother in the garden, she ran up to him and sat down for a minute on the ground at his feet, begging him to follow her:"
"Elle le mena au parterre. Le bois de roses restait odorant, les dernières fleurs avaient des parfums amers ; tandis que les feuillages, grandis démesurément, couvraient la terre d’une mare dormante. Mais Serge témoigna une telle répugnance à entrer dans ces broussailles, qu’ils restèrent sur le bord, cherchant de loin les allées où ils avaient passé au printemps. Elle se rappelait les moindres coins ; elle lui montrait du doigt la grotte où dormait la femme de marbre, les chevelures pendantes des chèvrefeuilles et des clématites, les champs de violettes, la fontaine qui crachait des œillets rouges, le grand escalier empli d’un ruissellement de giroflées fauves, la colonnade en ruine au centre de laquelle les lis bâtissaient un pavillon blanc. C’était là qu’ils étaient nés tous les deux, dans le soleil. Et elle racontait les plus petits détails de cette première journée, la façon dont ils marchaient, l’odeur que l’air avait à l’ombre. Lui, semblait écouter ; puis, d’une question, il prouvait qu’il n’avait pas compris. Le léger frisson qui le pâlissait ne le quittait point.","She led him to the floor. The rosewood remained fragrant, the last flowers had bitter perfumes; while the foliage, grown immeasurably, covered the ground with a dormant pool. But Serge showed such a reluctance to enter these brushwood that they remained on the edge, looking from afar for the paths where they had passed in the spring. She remembered the smallest corners; she pointed out to him the grotto where the marble woman slept, the hanging hair of honeysuckles and clematis, the fields of violets, the fountain which spat out red carnations, the grand staircase filled with a stream of wild wallflowers, the colonnade in ruins in the center of which the lilies built a white pavilion. That was where they were both born, in the sun. And she recounted the smallest details of that first day, the way they walked, the smell the air had in the shade. He seemed to be listening; then, with a question, he proved that he had not understood. The slight shiver that paled him never left him.","She led him to the flower garden. The arbour of roses was still fragrant, but the last flowers had a bitter scent, and the leaves, now grown much too large, lay on the earth like a stagnant pool. But Serge showed such reluctance about entering these thickets that they stayed on the edge, seeking only from a distance the paths they had taken in the spring. She could remember each little bit of the way: she pointed out the grotto where the marble woman lay sleeping, the hanging tresses of the honeysuckle and clematis, the fields of violets, the fountain that seemed to spit out red carnations, the big flight of steps covered with a stream of wild wallflowers, the ruined colonnade in the centre of which lilies were building a white home. It was there that they had both been born in the sunshine. And she recounted all the tiniest details of that first journey, how they had walked, and how the air smelled different in the shade. He, meanwhile, seemed to be listening, but then he would ask a question that showed he had not understood. The slight shivering which made him so pale simply did not stop.","She led him to the parterre, the flower-garden. The great thicket-like rosary was still fragrant with perfume, but there was a tinge of bitterness in the scent of the surviving blossoms, and their foliage, which had expanded in wild profusion, lay strewn upon the ground. Serge displayed such unwillingness to enter the tangled jungle, that they lingered on its borders, trying to detect in the distance the paths along which they had passed in the spring-time. Albine recollected every little nook. She pointed to the grotto where the marble woman lay sleeping; to the hanging screens of honeysuckle and clematis; the fields of violets; the fountain that spurted out crimson carnations; the steps down which flowed golden gilliflowers; the ruined colonnade, in the midst of which the lilies were rearing a snowy pavilion. It was there that they had been born again beneath the sunlight. And she recapitulated every detail of that first day together, how they had walked, and how fragrant had been the air beneath the cool shade. Serge seemed to be listening, but he suddenly asked a question which showed that he had not understood her. The slight shiver which made his face turn pale never left him."
"Puis, il reprenait :",Then he resumed:,Then he went on:,"And then he added: 'But I can't see it clearly, I see it without any light."
"Les tempes en sueur, il alla ouvrir l’autre fenêtre, cherchant un air plus vif. En bas, à gauche, s’étendait le cimetière, avec la haute barre du Solitaire, dont pas une brise ne remuait l’ombre. Il montait du champ vide une odeur de pré fauché. Le grand mur gris de l’église, ce mur tout plein de lézards, planté de giroflées, se refroidissait sous la lune ; tandis qu’une des larges fenêtres luisait, les vitres pareilles à des plaques d’acier. L’église endormie ne devait vivre à cette heure que de la vie extra-humaine du Dieu de l’hostie, enfermé dans le tabernacle. Il songeait à la tache jaune de la veilleuse, mangée par l’ombre, avec une tentation de redescendre, pour soulager sa tête malade, au milieu de ces ténèbres pures de toute souillure. Mais une terreur étrange le retint : il crut tout d’un coup, les yeux fixés sur les vitres allumées par la lune, voir l’église s’éclairer intérieurement d’un éclat de fournaise, d’une splendeur de fête infernale, où tournaient le mois de mai, les plantes, les bêtes, les filles des Artaud, qui prenaient furieusement des arbres entre leurs bras nus. Puis, en se penchant, au-dessous de lui, il aperçut la basse-cour de Désirée, toute noire, qui fumait. Il ne distinguait pas nettement les cases des lapins, les perchoirs des poules, la cabane des canards. C’était une seule masse tassée dans la puanteur, dormant de la même haleine pestilentielle. Sous la porte de l’étable, la senteur aigre de la chèvre passait ; pendant que le petit cochon vautré sur le dos, soufflait grassement, près d’une écuelle vide. De son gosier de cuivre, le grand coq fauve Alexandre jeta un cri, qui éveilla au loin, un à un, les appels passionnés de tous les coqs du village.","With sweaty temples, he went to open the other window, seeking a brighter air. Below, to the left, stretched the cemetery, with the high bar of the Solitaire, whose shadow not a breeze stirred. From the empty field came the smell of mowed meadows. The great gray wall of the church, that wall full of lizards, planted with wallflowers, grew cold under the moonlight; while one of the large windows gleamed, the panes like plates of steel. The sleeping church was to live at this hour only from the extra-human life of the God of the host, enclosed in the tabernacle. He was thinking of the yellow stain on the night light, eaten away by the shadows, with a temptation to come down again, to relieve his sick head, in the midst of this darkness pure of all stain. But a strange terror restrained him: he suddenly believed, his eyes fixed on the panes lit by the moon, to see the church light up inside with a blaze of furnace, with an infernal splendor of celebration, where the month of May turned, the plants, the animals, the daughters of the Artauds, who furiously took the trees between their bare arms. Then, bending down below him, he saw Désirée's barnyard, all black, smoking. He couldn't clearly distinguish the hutches for the rabbits, the perches for the hens, the hut for the ducks. It was a single mass huddled in the stench, sleeping with the same pestilential breath. Under the stable door the sour scent of the goat passed; while the little pig, sprawled on its back, puffed heavily, near an empty bowl. From his copper throat, the great tawny rooster Alexandre uttered a cry, which awoke in the distance, one by one, the passionate calls of all the roosters in the village.","With sweating brow, he went and opened the other window, to try to cool himself. Down below, to the left, lay the cemetery, with the tall outline of the Lone Tree, its shadow undisturbed by any breeze. From the empty field rose the smell of newly cut grass. The big grey wall of the church, that wall full of lizards, with wallflowers growing all over it, was cooling in the moonlight, and one of the large windows was gleaming, its panes like plates of steel. At this hour of the night, the sleeping church could be alive only with the non-human life of the God of the Host, enclosed in the tabernacle. He thought of the patch of yellow made by the night light, swallowed up in the darkness, and was tempted to go back down, into that darkness free from all taint, to soothe his suffering head. But a strange terror held him back: his eyes fixed on the windows lit by the moon, he suddenly seemed to see the church lighting up from within, blazing like a furnace, with the splendour of some hellish festival, in which the month of May, the plants and animals, the girls of Les Artaud, all swirled about, wildly clasping trees in their bare arms. Then, leaning out, he saw beneath him Désirée’s farmyard, all black and steamy. He could not clearly see the rabbit hutches, the hen roosts, or the shed for the ducks. It was just one single mass piled up in its stench, sleeping with the same pestiferous breath. The acrid smell of the goat came out from under the door of the stable; while the little pig, sprawled on its back, snorted loudly beside an empty bowl. From his brassy throat, Alexander, the big tawny rooster, uttered a cry that provoked, one after another, in the distance, the passionate calls of all the cocks of the village.","His brow perspiring, he proceeded to open the other window, as if to seek cooler air. Below him, to his left, lay the graveyard with the Solitaire erect like a bar, unstirred by the faintest breeze. From the empty field arose an odour like that of a newly mown meadow. The grey wall of the church, that wall full of lizards and planted with wall-flowers, gleamed coldly in the moonlight, and the panes of one of the windows glistened like plates of steel. The sleeping church could now have no other life within it than the extra-human life of the Divinity embodied in the Host enclosed in the tabernacle. He thought of the bracket lamp's yellow glow peeping out of the gloom, and was tempted to go down once more to try to ease his ailing head amid those deep shadows. But a strange feeling of terror held him back; he suddenly fancied, while his eyes were fixed upon the moonlit panes, that he saw the church illumined by a furnace-like glare, the blaze of a festival of hell, in which whirled the Month of May, the plants, the animals, and the girls of Les Artaud, who wildly encircled trees with their bare arms. Then, as he leaned over, he saw beneath him Desiree's poultry-yard, black and steaming. He could not clearly distinguish the rabbit-hutches, the fowls' roosting-places, or the ducks' house. The place was all one big mass heaped up in stench, still exhaling in its sleep a pestiferous odour. From under the stable-door came the acrid smell of the nanny-goat; while the little pig, stretched upon his back, snorted near an empty porringer. And suddenly with his brazen throat Alexander, the big yellow cock, raised a crow, which awoke in the distance impassioned calls from all the cocks of the village."
"Ils se remirent à marcher, surveillant les taillis, croyant voir des visages apparaître derrière chaque tronc. Albine jurait qu’un pas, au loin, les cherchait.","They started walking again, surveying the copses, believing they saw faces appear behind each trunk. Albine swore that a footstep in the distance was looking for them.","They started walking again, looking carefully into the thickets, thinking they saw faces appearing behind every trunk. Albine swore that footsteps in the distance were searching for them.","Then they went on again, scanning every tree and bush, and imagining that they could see faces peering at them from behind every trunk. Albine was certain, she said, that there were steps pursuing them in the distance. '"
"Serge répondit par un rire de puérilité. Ses membres avait repris la santé de l’adolescence, sans que des sensations plus conscientes se fussent éveillées en lui. Il restait des après-midi entiers en face du Paradou, avec sa moue d’enfant qui ne voit que du blanc, qui n’entend que le frisson des bruits. Il gardait ses ignorances de gamin, son toucher si innocent encore, qu’il ne lui permettait pas de distinguer la robe d’Albine de l’étoffe des vieux fauteuils. Et c’était toujours un émerveillement d’yeux grands ouverts qui ne comprennent pas, une hésitation de gestes ne sachant point aller où ils veulent, un commencement d’existence, purement instinctif, en dehors de la connaissance du milieu. L’homme n’était pas né.","Serge responded with a childish laugh. His limbs had regained the health of adolescence, without more conscious sensations having been awakened in him. He remained for whole afternoons in front of the Paradou, with his pout of a child who sees only white, who hears only the thrill of noises. He retained his boyish ignorance, his touch still so innocent that it did not allow him to distinguish Albine's dress from the stuff of the old arm-chairs. And it was always a wonder of eyes wide open that do not understand, a hesitation of gestures not knowing how to go where they want, a beginning of existence, purely instinctive, outside of knowledge of the environment. The man was not born.","Serge replied with an infantile laugh. His limbs had regained the health of adolescence, but without any awakening of his more conscious feelings. He stayed for whole afternoons at the window, facing the Paradou, with the face of a child who sees nothing but whiteness, and hears only the dull vibration of sounds. He still had all the ignorance of a little boy, and his sense of touch was still so primitive that it could not distinguish between Albine’s dress and the material covering the old armchairs. There were still those astonished wide-open eyes that do not understand what they see, and the hesitant gestures that do not know how to go where they wish, still just the beginnings of a purely instinctive life, with no knowledge of the surroundings. The man in him was not yet born.","Serge's answer was a childish laugh. His limbs were regaining the strength of adolescence, but more perceptive sensations remained unroused. He spent whole afternoons in gazing out on the Paradou, pouting like a child that sees nought but whiteness and hears but the vibration of sounds. He still retained the ignorance of urchinhood—his sense of touch as yet so innocent that he failed to tell Albine's gown from the covers of the old armchairs. His eyes still stared wonderingly; his movements still displayed the wavering hesitation of limbs which scarce knew how to reach their goal; his state was one of incipient, purely instinctive existence into which entered no knowledge of surroundings. The man was not yet born within him."
Comme tu es beau ! cria-t-elle.,You're so beautiful ! she cried.,‘How handsome you are!’ she cried.,How handsome you are!' she cried.
— Il faut que j’aille sonner… L’enterrement va sortir. Vous entendez bien.,“I have to ring the doorbell… The funeral is coming out. You hear well.,‘I must go and ring the bell... The funeral’s about to come out. You can hear.’,The procession will be coming out of church directly. You know that quite well.'
— Où est-ce ?,- Where is it ?,‘Where is it?’,"Then after a short silence, grieved to see her pouting, and longing for a renewal of her caresses, he opened his lips and asked: 'Where is it?'"
"L’Immaculée-Conception, sur la commode de noyer, souriait tendrement, du coin de ses lèvres minces, indiquées d’un trait de carmin. Elle était petite, toute blanche. Son grand voile blanc, qui lui tombait de la tête aux pieds, n’avait, sur le bord, qu’un filet d’or, imperceptible. Sa robe, drapée à longs plis droits sur un corps sans sexe, la serrait au cou, ne dégageait que ce cou flexible. Pas une seule mèche de ses cheveux châtains ne passait. Elle avait le visage rose, avec des yeux clairs tournés vers le ciel ; elle joignait des mains roses, des mains d’enfant, montrant l’extrémité des doigts sous les plis du voile, au-dessus de l’écharpe bleue, qui semblait nouer à sa taille deux bouts flottants du firmament. De toutes ses séductions de femme, aucune n’était nue, excepté ses pieds, des pieds adorablement nus, foulant l’églantier mystique. Et, sur la nudité de ses pieds, poussaient des roses d’or, comme la floraison naturelle de sa chair deux fois pure.","The Immaculate Conception, on the walnut chest of drawers, smiled tenderly from the corner of her thin lips, marked with a line of carmine. She was small, all white. Her great white veil, which fell from head to foot, had only an imperceptible thread of gold around the edge. Her dress, draped in long straight folds over a sexless body, hugged her around the neck, only showing her flexible neck. Not a single strand of her chestnut hair came through. She had a rosy face, with clear eyes turned towards the sky; she clasped her pink hands, the hands of a child, showing the ends of the fingers under the folds of the veil, above the blue scarf, which seemed to tie two floating ends of the firmament around her waist. Of all her womanly seductions, none were bare except her feet, adorably bare feet, treading the mystical rosehip. And on the nakedness of her feet rose golden roses, like the natural flowering of her twice pure flesh.","The Immaculate Conception on the walnut chest of drawers smiled down tenderly with her thin lips outlined in carmine. She was small and entirely white. Her long white veil, which hung from her head to her feet, had only an imperceptible thread of gold at its hem. Her robe, draped in long straight folds upon a sexless figure, was tight at the neckline, revealing only her supple neck. Not a single lock of her chestnut hair could be seen. Her face was pink, and her light-coloured eyes were turned heavenwards; her pink hands were clasped together, childlike hands, with fingertips showing under the folds of her veil, above the blue sash that seemed to be tying two loose ends of the firmament around her waist. As for her womanly attractions, not a single one was exposed, save her feet, feet that were adorably bare, treading upon the mystic rose bush. * And from the nakedness of her feet grew roses of gold, as if they were the natural flowering of her doubly pure flesh.","The Immaculate Conception, set on the walnut chest of drawers, was smiling softly, with her slender lips, marked by a dash of carmine. Her form was small and wholly white. Her long white veil, falling from head to foot, had but an imperceptible thread of gold around its edge. Her gown, draped in long straight folds over a sexless figure, was fastened around her flexible neck. Not a single lock of her chestnut hair peeped forth. Her countenance was rosy, with clear eyes upturned to heaven: her hands were clasped—rosy, childlike hands, whose finger-tips appeared beneath the folds of her veil, above the azure scarf which seemed to girdle her waist with two streaming ends of the firmament. Of all her womanly charms not one was bared, except her feet, adorable feet which trod the mystical eglantine. And from those nude feet sprang golden roses, like the natural efflorescence of her twofold purity of flesh."
"Les plantes seules n’avaient pas fait leur soumission. Albine et Serge marchaient royalement dans la foule des animaux qui leur rendaient obéissance. Lorsqu’ils traversaient le parterre, des vols de papillons se levaient pour le plaisir de leurs yeux, les éventaient de leurs ailes battantes, les suivaient comme le frisson vivant du soleil, comme des fleurs envolées secouant leur parfum. Au verger, ils se rencontraient, en haut des arbres, avec les oiseaux gourmands ; les pierrots, les pinsons, les loriots, les bouvreuils, leur indiquaient les fruits les plus mûrs, tout cicatrisés des coups de leur bec ; et il y avait là un vacarme d’écoliers en récréation, une gaieté turbulente de maraude, des bandes effrontées qui venaient voler des cerises à leurs pieds, pendant qu’ils déjeunaient, à califourchon sur les branches. Albine s’amusait plus encore dans les prairies, à prendre les petites grenouilles vertes accroupies le long des brins de jonc, avec leurs yeux d’or, leur douceur de bêtes contemplatives ; tandis que, à l’aide d’une paille sèche, Serge faisait sortir les grillons de leurs trous, chatouillait le ventre des cigales pour les engager à chanter, ramassait des insectes bleus, des insectes roses, des insectes jaunes, qu’il promenait ensuite sur ses manches, pareils à des boutons de saphir, de rubis et de topaze ; puis, là était la vie mystérieuse des rivières, les poissons à dos sombre filant dans le vague de l’eau, les anguilles devinées au trouble léger des herbes, le frai s’éparpillant au moindre bruit comme une fumée de sable noirâtre, les mouches montées sur de grands patins ridant la nappe morte de larges ronds argentés, tout ce pullulement silencieux qui les retenait le long des rives leur donnait l’envie souvent de se planter, les jambes nues, au beau milieu du courant, pour sentir le glissement sans fin de ces millions d’existences. D’autres jours, les jours de langueur tendre, c’était sous les arbres de la forêt, dans l’ombre sonore, qu’ils allaient écouter les sérénades de leurs musiciens, la flûte de cristal des rossignols, la petite trompette argentine des mésanges, l’accompagnement lointain des coucous ; ils s’émerveillaient du vol brusque des faisans, dont la queue mettait comme une raie de soleil au milieu des branches ; ils s’arrêtaient, souriants, laissant passer à quelques pas une bande joueuse de jeunes chevreuils, ou des couples de cerfs sérieux qui ralentissaient leur trot pour les regarder. D’autres jours encore, lorsque le ciel brûlait, ils montaient sur les roches, ils prenaient plaisir aux nuées de sauterelles que leurs pieds faisaient lever des landes de thym, avec le crépitement d’un brasier qui s’effare ; les couleuvres déroulées au bord des buissons roussis, les lézards allongés sur les pierres chauffées à blanc, les suivaient d’un œil amical ; les flamants roses, qui trempaient leurs pattes dans l’eau des sources, ne s’envolaient pas à leur approche, rassurant par leur gravité confiante les poules d’eau assoupies au milieu du bassin.","The plants alone had not made their submission. Albine and Serge marched royally through the crowd of animals that were doing their obedience. As they crossed the floor, flocks of butterflies rose to delight their eyes, fanned them with flapping wings, followed them like the living shiver of the sun, like flowers in flight shaking their perfume. In the orchard, they met, at the top of the trees, with the greedy birds; the pierrots, the finches, the orioles, the bullfinches, pointed out to them the ripest fruits, all scarred from the blows of their beaks; and there was a din of schoolboys in recess, a turbulent gaiety of marauding, cheeky bands who came to steal cherries at their feet, while they ate their lunch, astride the branches. Albine amused herself even more in the meadows, picking up the little green frogs squatting along the rushes, with their golden eyes, their gentle contemplative beasts; while, using a dry straw, Serge made the crickets come out of their holes, tickled the bellies of the cicadas to encourage them to sing, picked up blue insects, pink insects, yellow insects, which he walked then on her sleeves, like buttons of sapphire, ruby, and topaz; then, there was the mysterious life of the rivers, the dark-backed fish gliding in the wave of the water, the eels divined in the slight disturbance of the grass, the spawn scattering at the slightest noise like a smoke of blackish sand, the flies mounted on large skates rippling the dead tablecloth of large silver circles, all this silent swarming that kept them along the banks often made them want to plant themselves, bare legs, in the middle of the current, to feel the slip without end of these millions of existences. Other days, days of tender languor, it was under the trees of the forest, in the sonorous shade, that they went to listen to the serenades of their musicians, the crystal flute of the nightingales, the little silver trumpet of the chickadees, the distant accompaniment of cuckoo clocks; they marveled at the sudden flight of the pheasants, whose tails cast like a ray of sunshine among the branches; they would stop, smiling, letting a playful flock of young roe deer pass a few paces away, or couples of serious stags slowing down their trot to watch them. On other days still, when the sky was burning, they climbed on the rocks, they took pleasure in the clouds of locusts which their feet caused to rise from the moors of thyme, with the crackling of a bewildering brazier; snakes curled up on the edge of the scorched bushes, lizards stretched out on the white-hot stones, followed them with friendly eyes; the pink flamingos, which dipped their paws in the water of the springs, did not fly away at their approach, reassuring by their confident gravity the water hens dozing in the middle of the basin.","Only the plants had refused submission. Albine and Serge walked majestically among the host of animals making their obeisance. When they went through the flower garden, flights of butterflies rose up to delight their eyes, and fanned them with the flapping of their wings; they followed them like the very quivering of the sunlight, like flowers flying through the air, scattering their perfume. In the orchard, high in the trees, they encountered the greedy birds; sparrows, chaffinches, orioles, and bullfinches pointed out the ripest fruit, all scarred by their pecking beaks; it was like the noisy clamour of schoolchildren in the playground, the riotous merriment of marauding and shameless gangs that came and stole cherries at their very feet, while they sat astride the branches, breakfasting. In the grasslands, Albine enjoyed even more catching the little green frogs squatting among the reeds, with their golden eyes and the gentleness of contemplative creatures; while Serge poked crickets out of their holes with a straw, tickled the bellies of cicadas to make them sing, and collected blue insects, pink insects, and yellow insects, which he then spread out on his sleeve like buttons of sapphire, ruby, and topaz. Here too was the mysterious life of the rivers, the dark-backed fish flitting through the half-light of the water, eels only revealed by a slight disturbance of the grass, tiny tiddlers that scattered at the slightest sound like a cloud of blackish sand, and flies, mounted on their high skates, wrinkling the still surface with wide silvery rings; all that silent, teeming life that drew them to the riverbanks, and often made them want to stand midstream with bare legs, just to feel those millions of living things endlessly sliding past. On other days, days of tender languor, it was to the sonorous shade of the forest trees that they went, to hear their musicians serenading them, the crystal flute of the nightingales, the little silvery trumpet of the blue tits, and the distant accompaniment of the cuckoos; they marvelled at the sudden upward flight of the pheasants, whose tails seemed to create a ray of sunlight among the branches. They would stop, with a smile, to let a playful band of young roebucks go by, a few steps away, or pairs of solemn stags that slowed down to take a look at them. On yet other days, when the sky was afire, they would climb up on the rocks, delighted at the clouds of grasshoppers that their feet sent up from the banks of thyme, with the crackling sound of a flickering brazier; snakes, that lay uncoiled beside the russet bushes, and lizards, stretched out on the white-hot stones, followed them with a friendly eye; pink flamingos, dabbling their feet in the water of the springs, did not fly away at their approach, and their confident gravity reassured the moorhens dozing in the middle of the pool.","It was only the plants which had not made their submission. Albine and Serge passed like monarchs through the kingdom of animals, who rendered them humble and loyal obeisance. When they crossed the parterre, flights of butterflies arose to delight their eyes, to fan them with quivering wings, and to follow in their train like living sunbeams or flying blossoms. In the orchard, they were greeted by the birds that banqueted in the fruit-trees. The sparrows, the chaffinches, the golden orioles, the bullfinches, showed them the ripest fruit scarred by their hungry beaks; and while they sat astride the branches and breakfasted, birds twittered and sported round them like children at play, and even purloined the fruit beneath their very feet. Albine found even more amusement in the meadows, where she caught the little green frogs with eyes of gold, that lay squatting amongst the reeds, absorbed in contemplation; while Serge, with a piece of straw, poked the crickets out of their hiding-places, or tickled the grasshoppers to make them sing. He picked up insects of all colours, blue ones, red ones, yellow ones, and set them creeping upon his sleeve, where they gleamed and glittered like buttons of sapphire and ruby and topaz. Then there was all the mysterious life of the streams; the grey-backed fishes that threaded the dim waters, the eels whose presence was betrayed by a slight quivering of the water-plants, the young fry, which dispersed like blackish sand at the slightest sound, the long-legged flies and the water-beetles that ruffled into circling silvery ripples the stagnant surface of the pools; all that silent teeming life which drew them to the water and impelled them to dabble and stand in it, so that they might feel those millions of existences ever and ever gliding past their limbs. At other times, when the day was hot and languid, they would betake themselves beneath the voiceful shade of the forest and listen to the serenades of their musicians, the clear fluting of the nightingales, the silvery bugle-notes of the tomtits, and the far-off accompaniment of the cuckoos. They gazed with delight upon the swift flight of the pheasants, whose plumes gleamed like sudden sun rays amidst the branches, and with a smile they stayed their steps to let a troop of young roebucks bound past, or else a couple of grave stags that slackened their pace to look at them. Again, on other days they would climb up amongst the rocks, when the sun was blazing in the heavens, and find a pleasure in watching the swarms of grasshoppers which at the sound of their footsteps arose with a great crepitation of wings from the beds of thyme. The snakes that lay uncoiled beneath the parched bushes, or the lizards that sprawled over the red-hot stones, watched them with friendly eyes."
"Il n’acheva pas. Il se tourna pour prendre le calice sur l’autel, et rentra à la sacristie, la tête penchée, précédé de Vincent, qui faillit laisser tomber les burettes et le manuterge, en cherchant à voir ce que Catherine faisait, au fond de l’église.","He didn't finish. He turned to take the chalice from the altar, and returned to the sacristy, his head bowed, preceded by Vincent, who almost dropped the cruets and the manuterge, trying to see what Catherine was doing, at the bottom of the church.","He could not finish. He turned to get the chalice on the altar and went back into the sacristy, with his head bowed, preceded by Vincent, who almost dropped the cruets and the finger-cloth, trying to see what Catherine was doing at the other end of the church.","He was unable to finish. He turned round, took the chalice off the altar, and retired, with bowed head, into the vestry, preceded by Vincent, who almost let the cruets and napkin fall, in trying to see what Catherine might be doing at the end of the church."
"— À quoi bon souffrir, à quoi bon mourir ! répondit-elle. O Serge ! si tu te souvenais !… Tu me disais, ce jour-là, que tu étais fatigué. Et je savais bien que tu mentais, parce que le temps était frais et que nous n’avions pas marché plus d’un quart d’heure. Mais tu voulais t’asseoir, pour me prendre dans tes bras. Il y avait, tu sais bien, au fond du verger, un cerisier planté sur le bord d’un ruisseau, devant lequel tu ne pouvais passer sans éprouver le besoin de me baiser les mains, à petits baisers qui montaient le long de mes épaules jusqu’à mes lèvres. La saison des cerises était passée, tu mangeais mes lèvres… Les fleurs qui se fanaient nous faisaient pleurer. Un jour que tu trouvas une fauvette morte dans l’herbe, tu devins tout pâle, tu me serras contre ta poitrine, comme pour défendre à la terre de me prendre.","""What's the use of suffering, what's the use of dying!"" she answered. O Serge! if you remembered!… You told me, that day, that you were tired. And I knew you were lying, because the weather was cool and we hadn't walked for more than a quarter of an hour. But you wanted to sit down, to take me in your arms. There was, you know, at the bottom of the orchard, a cherry tree planted on the edge of a stream, in front of which you could not pass without feeling the need to kiss my hands, with little kisses which rose along my shoulders. to my lips. The cherry season was over, you were eating my lips… The withering flowers made us cry. One day when you found a dead warbler in the grass, you turned very pale, you hugged me to your chest, as if to prevent the earth from taking me.","‘Why all this suffering and dying?’ was her answer. ‘ O Serge! if you would just remember!... You told me, that day, that you were tired. And I knew you were lying, because it was a cool day and we had not been walking more than a quarter of an hour. But you wanted to sit down so you could take me in your arms. At the end of the orchard, as you know, there was a cherry tree growing on the edge of a stream, and you could not walk past it without needing to kiss my hands, with little kisses that went up along my shoulders to my lips. The cherry season was over, so you were eating my lips instead... The fading of flowers made us cry. One day, you found a little warbler dead in the grass, and you turned quite pale, and clasped me to your breast, as if to forbid the earth ever to take me.’","'Why suffer? why die?' she said. ' O Serge, if you would only remember! . . . You told me, that morning, that you were tired. But I knew that you were only pretending, for the air was quite cool and we had only been walking for a quarter of an hour. But you wanted to sit down that you might hold me in your arms. Right down in the orchard, by the edge of a stream, there was a cherry tree—you remember it, don't you?—which you never could pass without wishing to kiss my hands. And your kisses ran all up my arms and shoulders to my lips. Cherry time was over, and so you devoured my lips. . . . It used to make us feel so sad to see the flowers fading, and one day, when you found a dead bird in the grass, you turned quite pale, and caught me to your breast, as if to forbid the earth to take me.'"
"— Mon Dieu ! vous m’abandonnez, murmura-t-il. Que votre volonté soit faite !","- My God ! you forsake me, he murmured. Your will be done!","‘My God! you are abandoning me,’* he murmured. ‘Your will be done.’","'My God! Thou deserted me!' he murmured. ' Nevertheless, Thy will be done!'"
"Il pâlissait, il battait des paupières, comme si une grande clarté l’eût gêné.","He grew pale, he blinked his eyelids, as if a bright light had embarrassed him.","He grew pale and blinked, as if his eyes were dazzled by a bright light.","His face paled, and his eyelids quivered, as though too powerful a light were suddenly beating against them."
"— Allons, soyez sages, reprit Désirée. Vous en aurez toutes. Mais chacune son tour… La grande Lise, d’abord. Hein ! tu aimes joliment le plantain, toi !","""Come on, be good,"" resumed Désirée. You will have them all. But each in turn... La grande Lise, first. Eh ! you really like plantain!","‘Come on, behave yourselves,’ Désirée went on. ‘You shall all have some. But each one in turn... Big Liza first. My! you really like your plantain, don’t you!’","'Now, now, be good,' resumed Desiree; 'you shall all have some, but you must wait your turns. Now, big Lisa, you first. Eh! how fond you are of plantain, aren't you?'"
"— Il a avec lui une nièce qui lui est tombée sur les bras, une drôle de fille, une sauvage… Dépêchons. Tout a l’air mort dans la maison.","— He has with him a niece who fell on his arms, a strange girl, a savage… Let's hurry. Everything seems dead in the house.","‘He has a niece with him, a niece he had to take into his care, an odd girl, quite wild... Hurry up. There’s an air of death in the house.’","'Yes, quite alone,' replied his uncle, adding, however, the next minute: 'Well, he has with him a niece whom he had to take in, a queer girl, a regular savage. But we must make haste. The whole place looks death-like.'"

"— Je vais vous dire, murmura-t-il en levant sa tête futée vers celui-ci. Il y a un nid de fauvettes dans les ronces, dessous cette roche. Voici plus de dix jours que je le guette… Alors, comme les petits sont éclos, je suis venu, ce matin, après avoir servi votre messe…","“I'll tell you,” he muttered, raising his shrewd head to this one. There is a nest of warblers in the brambles under this rock. I have been watching him for more than ten days... So, as the little ones have hatched, I came this morning, after having served your mass...","‘I’ll tell you,’ he murmured, raising his wily head towards the priest. ‘There’s a warblers’ nest in the brambles just beneath this rock. I’ve been watching it for more than ten days... So, now the little ones are hatched, I came here this morning, after serving the Mass for you...’","'I'll tell you,' he said in a low voice, as he raised his bushy head. ' There is a tomtit's nest in the brambles there, under that rock. For over ten days I've been watching it, and now the little ones are hatched, so I came this morning after serving your mass.'"
"Il s’écarta, chercha sur une tombe une motte de terre, qu’il revint jeter dans les ronces. Mais il manqua le nid. Une seconde motte lancée plus adroitement bouscula le frêle berceau, jeta les petits au torrent.","He moved aside, looked on a grave for a clod of earth, which he returned to throw in the brambles. But he missed the nest. A second clod launched more skilfully jostled the frail cradle, threw the little ones into the torrent.","He turned aside, reached for a clod of earth on one of the tombs and threw it into the brambles. But he missed the nest. A second clod, more skilfully thrown, shook the frail cradle and hurled the chicks into the torrent.","Thereupon he stepped aside, picked a clod of earth off a grave and flung it into the brambles. But he missed the nest. Another clod, however, more skilfully thrown upset the frail cradle, and precipitated the fledglings into the torrent below."
— Il fait beau. Tu aurais le soleil. Tu verrais les arbres.,- The weather's nice. You would have the sun. You would see the trees.,‘It’s a fine day. You’d have the sun. You’d see the trees.’,"'No, please don't. . . ."
"— C’est pour me donner que je te prends, reprit-il. Je veux me donner à toi tout entier, à jamais ; car, je le sais bien à cette heure, tu es ma maîtresse, ma souveraine, celle que je dois adorer à genoux. Je ne suis ici que pour t’obéir, pour rester à tes pieds, guettant tes volontés, te protégeant de mes bras étendus, écartant du souffle les feuilles volantes qui troubleraient ta paix… Oh ! daigne permettre que je disparaisse, que je m’absorbe dans ton être, que je sois l’eau que tu bois, le pain que tu manges. Tu es ma fin. Depuis que je me suis éveillé au milieu de ce jardin, j’ai marché à toi, j’ai grandi pour toi. Toujours, comme but, comme récompense, j’ai vu ta grâce. Tu passais dans le soleil, avec ta chevelure d’or ; tu étais une promesse m’annonçant que tu me ferais connaître, un jour, la nécessité de cette création, de cette terre, de ces arbres, de ces eaux, de ce ciel, dont le mot suprême m’échappe encore… Je t’appartiens, je suis esclave, je t’écouterai, les lèvres sur tes pieds.","""It is to give myself that I take you,"" he resumed. I want to give myself entirely to you, forever; for, I know it well at this hour, you are my mistress, my sovereign, the one whom I must adore on my knees. I am only here to obey you, to stay at your feet, watching your wishes, protecting you with my outstretched arms, blowing away the flying leaves that would disturb your peace... Oh! deign to allow me to disappear, to become absorbed in your being, to be the water you drink, the bread you eat. You are my end. Since I woke up in the middle of this garden, I walked to you, I grew up for you. Always, as a goal, as a reward, I have seen your grace. You passed in the sun, with your golden hair; you were a promise announcing to me that you would make known to me, one day, the necessity of this creation, of this earth, of these trees, of these waters, of this sky, the supreme word of which still escapes me... belong, I am a slave, I will listen to you, my lips on your feet.","‘I am taking you only to give myself to you,’ he went on. ‘I want to give myself to you entirely and forever; for I know now that you are my mistress, my sovereign, the one I must worship on my knees. I am here only to obey you, to lie at your feet, awaiting your wishes, protecting you with my outstretched arms, and blowing away the flying leaves that might disturb your peace... Oh, please allow me to disappear, to be absorbed into your being, to become the water you drink, the bread you eat. You are my be-all and end-all. Ever since I awoke in this garden, I’ve moved towards you, I’ve grown tall for you. Always, as my aim and my reward, I’ve seen your grace. You went by in the sunshine, with your golden hair; you were a promise, telling me that one day you would explain to me the reason for this creation, this earth, these trees and streams, this sky, whose ultimate meaning still eludes me... I belong to you. I am a slave, I shall hear and obey you, with my lips upon your feet.’","'But if you are mine, I am yours,' said he; 'yours for ever; for I now well know that you are my queen, my sovereign, whom I must worship on bended knee. I am here only to obey you, to lie at your feet, to anticipate your wishes, to shelter you with my arms, to drive away whatever might trouble your tranquillity. And you are my life's goal. Since I first awoke in this garden, you have ever been before me; I have grown up that I might be yours. Ever, as my end, my reward, have I gazed upon your grace. You passed in the sunshine with the sheen of your golden hair; you were a promise that I should some day know all the mysteries and necessities of creation, of this earth, of these trees, these waters, these skies, whose last secret is yet unrevealed. I belong to you; I am your slave; I will listen to you and obey you, with my lips upon your feet.'"
"— Ah ! que tu m’as fait souffrir ! Je n’étais plus rien pour toi, je passais mes journées, inutile, impuissante, me désespérant comme une propre à rien… Et pourtant, les premiers jours, je t’avais soulagé.

I was nothing to you anymore, I spent my days, useless, helpless, despairing like a good-for-nothing… And yet, the first few days, I had relieved you. You saw me, you talked to me...

"Le dégoût, la haine de la femme le firent jurer comme un charretier. L’abbé Mouret, après l’avoir écouté, la face calme, finit par sourire de sa violence. Il appela Voriau, qui s’était écarté dans un champ voisin.","Disgust, hatred of women made him swear like a carter. Abbé Mouret, after having listened to him, his face calm, ends up smiling at his violence.

"Et elle devenait toute rose. C’était une pudeur naissante, une honte qui la prenait comme un mal, qui tachait la candeur de sa peau, où jusque-là pas un trouble du sang n’était monté. Serge eut peur, à la voir ainsi toute rose, les joues confuses, les yeux gros de larmes. Il voulait la reprendre, la calmer d’une caresse ; mais elle s’écarta, elle lui fit signe, d’un geste désespéré, qu’ils n’étaient plus seuls. Elle regardait, rougissant davantage, sa robe dénouée qui montrait sa nudité, ses bras, son cou, sa gorge. Sur ses épaules, les mèches folles de ses cheveux mettaient un frisson. Elle essaya de rattacher son chignon ; puis, elle craignit de découvrir sa nuque. Maintenant, le frôlement d’une branche, le heurt léger d’une aile d’insecte, la moindre haleine du vent, la faisaient tressaillir, comme sous l’attouchement déshonnête d’une main invisible.","And she was getting all rosy. It was a budding modesty, a shame that took her like an evil, that stained the candor of her skin, where until then no blood disorder had arisen. Serge was frightened, seeing her so rosy, her cheeks confused, her eyes full of tears. He wanted to take her back, calm her with a caress; but she moved away, she made a sign to him, with a desperate gesture, that they were no longer alone. She looked, blushing even more, at her loose dress which showed her nudity, her arms, her neck, her bosom. On his shoulders, the crazy locks of his hair put a chill. She tried to tie up her bun; then she was afraid of uncovering the back of her neck. Now the brushing of a branch, the slight knock of an insect's wing, the slightest breath of the wind, made her start, as if under the dishonest touch of an invisible hand.","She had become quite flushed. It was a nascent modesty, a shame that gripped her like an illness, staining the whiteness of her skin, which had never before shown any disturbance of the blood. Serge was alarmed, seeing her thus, her face all pink, with burning cheeks, and her eyes full of tears. He wanted to embrace her again, and calm her with a caress; but she drew away, and indicated with a despairing gesture that they were no longer alone. Blushing even more, she was looking at her dress which was undone and showed her naked flesh, her arms, her neck, her breast. Stray locks of her hair touching her shoulders made her shiver. She tried to repin her chignon; then she feared she was leaving her neck exposed. Now the rustling of a branch, the slight noise of an insect’s wing, or the slightest breath of wind made her shudder, as if at the indecent touch of an invisible hand.","She had turned quite scarlet. It was new-born modesty, a sense of shame which had laid hold of her like a fever, mantling over the snowy whiteness of her skin, which never previously had known that flush. Serge was alarmed at seeing her thus crimson, her face full of distress, her eyes brimming with tears. He tried to clasp her in his arms again and to soothe her with a caress; but she slipped away from him, and, with a despairing gesture, made sign that they were not alone. And her blushes grew deeper as her eyes fell upon her bare arms. She shuddered when her loose hanging hair stirred against her neck and shoulders. The slightest touch of a waving bough or a passing insect, the softest breath of air, now made her tremble as if some invisible hand were grasping at her."

"— Vous n’allez peut-être pas sortir avec de la boue d’hier à votre soutane ! Si vous l’aviez laissée sur la rampe, elle serait propre… Elle est encore bonne, cette soutane.

Big Fortuné looks stupid.’","'Yes,' said La Rousse, 'and so big Fortune will still be able to go to his work, and Rosalie won't lose her day's pay at the vintage. It is very convenient to be married so early in the morning. He looks very sheepish, that big Fortune.'"

It’s my garden, mine alone. It’s splendidly big. I haven’t yet found the end of it.’","'Frightened? What of?' she said, her eyes wide open with astonishment. ' The walls are too high, no one can get in. There's only myself. It is my garden, all my very own. A fine big one, too. I haven't found out where it ends yet.'"
"— Ah ! dit enfin Albine, comme il faisait bon au soleil, tu te rappelles !… Un matin, c’était à gauche du parterre, nous marchions le long d’une haie de grands rosiers. Je me souviens de la couleur de l’herbe ; elle était presque bleue, avec des moires vertes. Quand nous arrivâmes au bout de la haie, nous revînmes sur nos pas, tant le soleil avait là une odeur douce. Et ce fut toute notre promenade, cette matinée-là, vingt pas en avant, vingt pas, en arrière, un coin de bonheur dont tu ne voulais plus sortir. Les mouches à miel ronflaient ; une mésange ne nous quitta pas, sautant de branche en branche ; des processions de bêtes, autour de nous, s’en allaient à leurs affaires. Tu murmurais : « Que la vie est bonne ! » La vie, c’était les herbes, les arbres, les eaux, le ciel, le soleil, dans lequel nous étions tout blonds, avec des cheveux d’or.","- Oh! said Albine at last, ""how good it was in the sun, remember!... One morning, it was to the left of the parterre, we were walking along a hedge of tall rosebushes. I remember the color of the grass; it was almost blue, with green moires. When we reached the end of the hedge, we retraced our steps, so sweet was the sun there. And that was our whole walk that morning, twenty steps forward, twenty steps back, a corner of happiness from which you no longer wanted to leave. The honey flies snored; a chickadee stayed with us, jumping from branch to branch; processions of beasts, around us, went about their business. You whispered, ""How good life is!"" “Life was the grass, the trees, the waters, the sky, the sun, in which we were all blond, with golden hair.","‘Ah!’ said Albine at last, ‘how lovely it was in the sunshine, do you remember? One morning, just to the left of the flower garden, we were walking beside a hedge of tall rose bushes. I remember the colour of the grass: it was almost blue, with a shimmer of green. When we got to the end of the hedge, we turned and walked back, the sunshine there had so sweet a scent. And that was our whole walk that morning, twenty steps forward and twenty steps back, a place of such happiness you did not want to leave. Honeybees were buzzing, and a blue tit stayed with us, flitting from branch to branch; all around us troupes of creatures went off on their own errands. You were murmuring “How good life is!” Life was the grass, the trees, the streams, the sky, the sunlight in which we stood, blond beings with hair of gold.’","'Ah,' said Albine at last, 'how sweet it used to be in the sunshine! Don't you remember? One morning we walked past a hedge of tall rose bushes, to the left of the flower-garden. I recollect the very colour of the grass; it was almost blue, shot with green. When we reached the end of the hedge we turned and walked back again, so sweet was the perfume of the sunny air. And we did nothing else, that morning; we took just twenty paces forward and then twenty paces back. It was so sweet a spot you would not leave it. The bees buzzed all around; and there was a tomtit that never left us, but skipped along by our side from branch to branch. You whispered to me, “How delightful is life!” Ah! life! it was the green grass, the trees, the running waters, the sky, and the sun, amongst which we seemed all fair and golden.'"

"— Quelque folie encore, murmura celui-ci, qui ne put s’empêcher de sourire.","""Some madness again,"" murmured the latter, who could not help smiling.","‘Some new bit of madness,’ he muttered, but couldn’t help smiling.","'Another piece of folly, no doubt,' he murmured, unable to refrain from smiling."
"Heure de volupté divine. Les livres de dévotion à la Vierge brûlaient entre ses mains. Ils lui parlaient une langue d’amour qui fumait comme un encens. Marie n’était plus l’adolescente voilée de blanc, les bras croisés, debout à quelques pas de son chevet ; elle arrivait au milieu d’une splendeur, telle que Jean la vit, vêtue de soleil, couronnée de douze étoiles, ayant la lune sous les pieds ; elle l’embaumait de sa bonne odeur, l’enflammait du désir du ciel, le ravissait jusque dans la chaleur des astres flambant à son front. Il se jetait devant elle, se criait son esclave ; et rien n’était plus doux que ce mot d’esclave, qu’il répétait, qu’il goûtait davantage, sur sa bouche balbutiante, à mesure qu’il s’écrasait à ses pieds, pour être sa chose, son rien, la poussière effleurée du vol de sa robe bleue. Il disait avec David : « Marie est faite pour moi. » Il ajoutait avec l’évangéliste : « Je l’ai prise par tout mon bien. » Il la nommait : « Ma chère maîtresse », manquant de mots, arrivant à un babillage d’enfant et d’amant, n’ayant plus que le souffle entrecoupé de sa passion. Elle était la Bienheureuse, la Reine du ciel célébrée par les neuf chœurs des Anges, la Mère de la belle dilection, le Trésor du Seigneur. Les images vives s’étalaient, la comparaient à un paradis terrestre, fait d’une terre vierge, avec des parterres de fleurs vertueuses, des prairies vertes d’espérance, des tours imprenables de force, des maisons charmantes de confiance. Elle était encore une fontaine que le Saint-Esprit avait scellée, un sanctuaire où la très sainte Trinité se reposait, le trône de Dieu, la cité de Dieu, l’autel de Dieu, le temple de Dieu, le monde de Dieu. Et lui, se promenait dans ce jardin, à l’ombre, au soleil, sous l’enchantement des verdures ; lui, soupirait après l’eau de cette fontaine ; lui, habitait le bel intérieur de Marie, s’y appuyant, s’y cachant, s’y perdant, sans réserve, buvant le lait d’amour infini qui tombait goutte à goutte de ce sein virginal.","Hour of divine pleasure. The books of devotion to the Virgin were burning in his hands. They spoke to him in a language of love that smoked like incense. Marie was no longer the adolescent veiled in white, her arms folded, standing a few steps from her bedside; she arrived in the midst of a splendor such as John saw her, clothed in the sun, crowned with twelve stars, having the moon under her feet; she embalmed him with her good odor, inflamed him with desire for the sky, ravished him even in the heat of the stars blazing on his brow. He threw himself in front of her, shouting to himself his slave; and nothing was sweeter than that word slave, which he repeated, which he tasted more, on his stammering mouth, as he crushed himself at her feet, to be his thing, his nothing, the dust touched by the flight of her blue dress. He said with David: “Mary is made for me. He added with the evangelist: “I have taken it with all my good. He called her: ""My dear mistress,"" lacking words, arriving at the babble of a child and a lover, having nothing left but his breath interrupted by his passion. She was the Blessed, the Queen of Heaven celebrated by the nine choirs of Angels, the Mother of beautiful love, the Treasure of the Lord. The vivid images spread out, comparing her to an earthly paradise, made of virgin land, with beds of virtuous flowers, green meadows of hope, impregnable towers of strength, charming houses of confidence. She was still a fountain that the Holy Spirit had sealed, a sanctuary where the Most Holy Trinity rested, the throne of God, the city of God, the altar of God, the temple of God, the world of God. And he was walking in this garden, in the shade, in the sun, under the enchantment of greenery; he sighed after the water of this fountain; he inhabited the beautiful interior of Mary, leaning there, hiding there, losing himself there, without reserve, drinking the milk of infinite love which fell drop by drop from that virginal breast.","This was a time of divine voluptuousness. The books devoted to the cult of Mary burned in his hands. They spoke to him in a language of love that gave off a smoke like incense. Mary was no longer the adolescent girl veiled in white, standing with folded arms a few steps from his bed; she arrived now in a blaze of light, just as Saint John saw her,* dressed in the rays of the sun, crowned with twelve stars, with the moon at her feet; she perfumed him with her sweet scent, inflaming him with desire for Heaven, ravishing him even with the heat of the stars blazing upon her brow. He threw himself down before her, declaring himself her slave; and nothing was sweeter to him than this word slave, which he kept repeating, enjoying it all the more in his stammering mouth as he prostrated himself at her feet, to become her meanest possession, nothing more than the dust raised by the passing of her blue robe. He said, like David,* ‘Mary is made for me.’ And he added, like the Evangelist, ‘I have taken her to be my sole wealth.’ He called her ‘my dear mistress’, and bereft of words, descended into the babbling of a child or lover, in the breathless gasping of his passion. She was the Blessed among women, the Queen of Heaven, glorified by the nine choirs of angels, the Mother of purest love, the Treasure of the Lord. Vivid images spread out before him, comparing her to an earthly paradise of virgin land, with beds of flowers of virtue, green meadows of hope, impregnable towers of strength, and delightful dwellings of trust. She was also a fountain sealed by the Holy Spirit, a sanctuary on which the Holy Trinity rested, the throne of God, the city of God, the altar of God, the temple of God, the world of God. And he, walking in this garden, in the shade and in the sun, in the enchantment of this greenery, sighed for the water of that fountain, lived in the beautiful inmost being of Mary, leaning upon it, hiding within it, wholly losing himself in it, drinking the milk of infinite love that fell drop by drop from that virginal breast.","It was an hour of divine voluptuousness! The books treating of devotion to the Virgin burned his hands. They spoke to him in a language of love, warm, fragrant as incense. Mary no longer seemed a young maiden veiled in white, standing with crossed arms, a foot or two away from his pillow. She came surrounded by splendour, even as John saw her, clothed with the sun, crowned with twelve stars, and having the moon beneath her feet. She perfumed him with her fragrance, inflamed him with longing for heaven, ravished him even with the ardent glow of the planets flaming on her brow. He threw himself before her and called himself her slave. No word could have been sweeter than that word of slave, which he repeated, which he relished yet more and more as it trembled on his stammering tongue, whilst casting himself at her feet—to become her thing, her mite, the dust lightly scattered by the waving of her azure robe. With David he exclaimed: 'Mary is made for me,' and with the Evangelist he added: 'I have taken her for my all.' He called her his 'beloved mistress,' for words failed him, and he fell into the prattle of child or lover, his breath breaking with intensity of passion. She was the Blessed among women, the Queen of Heaven glorified by the nine Choirs of Angels, the Mother of Predilection, the Treasure of the Lord. All the vivid imagery of her cult unrolled itself before him comparing to her an earthly paradise of virgin soil, with beds of flowering virtues, green meadows of hope, impregnable towers of strength, and smiling dwellings of confidence. Again she was a fountain sealed by the Holy Ghost, a shrine and dwelling-place of the Holy Trinity, the Throne of God, the City of God, the Altar of God, the Temple of God, and the World of God. And he walked in that garden, in its shade, its sunlight, beneath its enchanting greenery; he sighed after the water of that Fountain; he dwelt within Mary's beauteous precincts—resting, hiding, heedlessly straying there, drinking in the milk of infinite love that fell drop by drop from her virginal bosom."
"Ils tournèrent cela en plaisanterie pendant toute la journée. L’arbre n’existait pas. C’était un conte de nourrice. Ils en parlaient pourtant avec un léger frisson. Et, le lendemain, ils décidèrent qu’ils iraient faire une promenade au fond du parc, sous les hautes futaies, que Serge ne connaissait pas encore. Le matin du départ, Albine ne voulut rien emporter ; elle était songeuse, même un peu triste, avec un sourire très doux. Ils déjeunèrent, ils ne descendirent que tard. Le soleil, déjà chaud, leur donnait une langueur, les faisait marcher lentement l’un près de l’autre, cherchant les filets d’ombre. Ni le parterre, ni le verger, qu’ils durent traverser, ne les retinrent. Quand ils arrivèrent sous la fraîcheur des grands ombrages, ils ralentirent encore leurs pas, ils s’enfoncèrent dans le recueillement attendri de la forêt, sans une parole, avec un gros soupir, comme s’ils eussent éprouvé un soulagement à échapper au plein jour. Puis, lorsqu’il n’y eut que des feuilles autour d’eux, lorsque aucune trouée ne leur montra les lointains ensoleillés du parc, ils se regardèrent, souriants, vaguement inquiets.","They made fun of it all day. The tree did not exist. It was a nursery tale. Yet they spoke of it with a slight shudder. And, the next day, they decided that they would go for a walk at the end of the park, under the tall trees, which Serge did not yet know. The morning of departure, Albine did not want to take anything; she was pensive, even a little sad, with a very gentle smile. They had lunch, they didn't come down until late. The sun, already hot, gave them a languor, made them walk slowly side by side, looking for threads of shade. Neither the parterre nor the orchard, which they had to cross, held them back. When they arrived under the coolness of the great shade, they slowed their steps still further, they plunged into the tender meditation of the forest, without a word, with a heavy sigh, as if they had experienced relief in escaping from broad daylight. . Then, when there were only leaves around them, when no gap showed them the sunny distances of the park, they looked at each other, smiling, vaguely worried.","They joked about this for the rest of the day. The tree did not exist. It was just a fairy tale. Yet they spoke of it with a slight shiver. And the next day they decided they would take a walk to the far end of the park, into the woods of tall trees that Serge had not yet seen. On the morning they set out, Albine decided not to take anything with her; she seemed thoughtful, even a little sad, though with a very sweet smile. They breakfasted and did not go down until quite late. The sun, already quite hot, made them feel rather languid and inclined to walk slowly, looking for patches of shade. They did not pause in the flower garden, nor in the orchard, though they had to go through both. When they reached the cool shade of the tall trees they slowed down even more; they plunged into the gentle quietness of the forest without a word, but with a heavy sigh, as if with relief at escaping from the full sun. Then once they had nothing but leaves around them, and no gap in the foliage to show the sunlit parts of the park in the distance, they looked at each other, smiling, but slightly uneasy.","They joked about the tree all day and made fun of it. It didn't exist. It was only a nursery-story. Yet they both spoke of it with a slight feeling of awe. And on the morrow they settled that they would go to the far end of the park and pay a visit to the great forest-trees which Serge had not yet seen. Albine refused to take anything along with them. They breakfasted before starting and did not set off till late. The heat of the sun, which was then great, brought them a feeling of languor, and they sauntered along gently, side by side, seeking every patch of sheltering shade. They lingered neither in the garden nor the orchard, through which they had to pass. When they gained the shady coolness beneath the big trees, they dropped into a still slower pace; and, without a word, but with a deep sigh, as though it were welcome relief to escape from the glare of day, they pushed on into the forest's depths. And when they had nothing but cool green leaves about them, when no glimpse of the sunlit expanse was afforded by any gap in the foliage, they looked at each other and smiled, with a feeling of vague uneasiness."
"— Je ne vois pas, je ne comprends pas, cria-t-il en tendant ses mains à Albine, avec un geste de suprême fatigue.","""I don't see, I don't understand,"" he cried, holding out his hands to Albine with a gesture of supreme fatigue.","‘I can’t see, I don’t understand,’ he cried, stretching out his hands to Albine in a gesture of utter weariness.","'I cannot see, I cannot understand,' he cried, stretching out his hands to Albine with a gesture of uttermost weariness."
"Un moment, ils se turent, ravis. Il leur semblait qu’un chant de flûte les précédait, que leurs paroles leur venaient d’un orchestre suave qu’ils ne voyaient point. Ils ne s’en allaient plus qu’à tout petits pas, penchés l’un vers l’autre, tournant sans fin entre les troncs gigantesques. Au loin, le long des colonnades, il y avait des coups de soleil couchant, pareils à un défilé de filles en robes blanches, entrant dans l’église, pour des fiançailles, au sourd ronflement des orgues.","For a moment they were silent, delighted. It seemed to them that a flute song preceded them, that their words came to them from a suave orchestra which they did not see. They only went away with very small steps, leaning towards each other, turning endlessly between the gigantic trunks. In the distance, along the colonnades, there were rays of setting sun, like a procession of girls in white dresses, entering the church, for an engagement, to the dull roar of the organs.","For a moment they were silent, in rapture. It seemed as if the sound of a flute went before them, and that their words came to them from a sweetly playing orchestra they could not see. They walked on now only with tiny steps, leaning towards each other and endlessly going round and round through the gigantic trees. In the distance, along the colonnades, there were glimpses of the setting sun, like a procession of girls in white dresses going to church for a betrothal, accompanied by the dull roar of the organ.","For a moment or two they remained silent, enraptured. It seemed to them that soft, flute-like music went before them, that their own words came from some dulcet orchestra which they could not see. Shorter and shorter became their steps as they leaned one towards the other, ever threading their way amidst the mighty trees. Afar off through the long vista of the colonnades were glimpses of waning sunlight, showing like a procession of white-robed maidens entering church for a betrothal ceremony amid the low strains of an organ."
Et se tournant :,And turning:,"And turning round, she asked:","Then turning round, she asked:"
