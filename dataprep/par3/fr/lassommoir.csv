"Le vacarme reprenait, Lantier était oublié. Les dames apprêtèrent leurs verres et leurs couteaux, pour accompagner le refrain. On riait à l'avance, en regardant le zingueur, qui se calait sur les jambes d'un air canaille. Il prit une voix enrouée de vieille femme.","The din resumed, Lantier was forgotten. The ladies prepared their glasses and their knives to accompany the chorus. We laughed in advance, watching the zinc worker, who wedged himself on his legs with a rascally air. He took on the hoarse voice of an old woman.","His song was one familiar to them all and even to the street, for the little crowd at the door joined in the chorus.","The uproar was beginning again. Lantier was forgotten. The ladies prepared their glasses and their knives for accompanying the chorus. They laughed beforehand, as they looked at the zinc-worker, who steadied himself on his legs as he put on his most vulgar air. Mimicking the hoarse voice of an old woman, he sang:"
"- Qu'est-ce que vous avez ? répéta Gervaise, inquiète.","- What do you have ? repeated Gervaise, worried.","""What is the matter?"" asked Gervaise anxiously.","“What is the matter with you?” inquired Gervaise, feeling anxious."
"La blanchisseuse, très inquiète, la supplia de se taire. Un profond silence, tout d'un coup, s'était fait. Madame Putois venait de se lever et chantait : A l'abordage ! Les convives, muets et recueillis, la regardaient ; même Poisson avait posé sa pipe au bord de la table, pour mieux l'entendre. Elle se tenait raide, petite et rageuse, la face blême sous son bonnet noir ; elle lançait son poing gauche en avant avec une fierté convaincue, en grondant d'une voix plus grosse qu'elle :","The laundress, very worried, begged her to be quiet. A profound silence had suddenly fallen. Madame Putois had just got up and was singing: A l'abordage! The guests, mute and contemplative, gazed at her; even Poisson had placed his pipe on the edge of the table, the better to hear him. She stood stiff, small and furious, her face pale under her black cap; she threw her left fist forward with convinced pride, growling in a voice bigger than herself:","The clearstarcher begged her to say no more. Mme Putois started up and began a fierce piratical song, standing stiff and erect in her black dress, her pale face surrounded by her black lace cap, and gesticulating violently.","The laundress, greatly upset, begged her to leave off. A profound silence suddenly succeeded the clamor. Madame Putois had just risen and was about to sing “The Boarding of the Pirate.” The guests, silent and thoughtful, watched her; even Poisson had laid his pipe down on the edge of the table the better to listen to her. She stood up to the full height of her little figure, with a fierce expression about her, though her face looked quite pale beneath her black cap; she thrust out her left fist with a satisfied pride as she thundered in a voice bigger than herself:"
"- Dites donc, garçon, c'est du lapin de gouttière, ça ? Il miaule encore.","- Hey, boy, is that gutter rabbit? He meows again.","""Say, boy, is that a gutter rabbit? It mews still.""","“I say, waiter, that rabbit’s from the housetops. It still mews.”"
"Coupeau hésita un instant ; et, paisiblement, comme s'il s'était décidé après de mûres réflexions, il posa son sac par terre, en disant :","Coupeau hesitated for a moment; and, peacefully, as if he had made up his mind after mature reflection, he put his bag on the ground, saying:","Coupeau hesitated a moment, and then slowly and deliberately, as if he had arrived at a decision after mature deliberation, he laid his bag on the ground.","Coupeau hesitated an instant; and then, quietly, as though he had only made up his mind after considerable reflection, he laid his bag on the ground saying:"
"- Ce n'est rien, dit tranquillement Lantier, en baissant la voix. Elle se vide. L'explication fit hocher la tête, d'un air rassuré, et la compagnie reposa les verres sur la table.","""It's nothing,"" said Lantier quietly, lowering his voice. She empties. The explanation made their heads nod, reassured, and the company put the glasses back on the table.","When the Poissons went away Lantier accompanied them in order, he said, to leave his bed for the ladies, who could take turns in sleeping there.","“It’s nothing,” said Lantier quietly, lowering his voice. “She’s emptying.” The explanation caused the others to nod their heads in a reassured way, and they replaced their glasses on the table."
"Alors, le jeune homme se perdit au milieu de la foule, en murmurant :","Then the young man lost himself in the middle of the crowd, murmuring:",The youth slipped away and was lost in the crowd.,"Thereupon the young man dived into the midst of the crowd, muttering: “What a dirty blackguard!”"
"- Madame doit aimer les douceurs, murmura-t-il.","- Madame must like sweets, he murmured.","""The lady would like something sweet like herself.""","“Madame probably likes sweet things,” murmured he."
"Mais, un jour, rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière, le fabricant de boutons avait osé allonger son nez entre la nièce et la tante, pour murmurer des choses qui n'étaient pas à dire. Et madame Lerat, effrayée, répétant qu'elle n'était même plus tranquille pour elle, lâcha tout le paquet à son frère. Alors, ce fut un autre train. Il y eut, chez les Coupeau, de jolis charivaris. D'abord, le zingueur flanqua une tripotée à Nana. Qu'est-ce qu'on lui apprenait ? cette gueuse-là donnait dans les vieux ! Ah bien ! qu'elle se laissât surprendre à se faire relicher dehors, elle était sûre de son affaire, il lui couperait le cou un peu vivement ! Avait-on jamais vu ! une morveuse qui se mêlait de déshonorer la famille ! Et il la secouait, en disant, nom de Dieu ! qu'elle eût à marcher droit, car ce serait lui qui la surveillerait à l'avenir. Dès qu'elle rentrait, il la visitait, il la regardait bien en face, pour deviner si elle ne rapportait pas une souris sur l'œil, un de ces petits baisers qui se fourrent là sans bruit. Il la flairait, la retournait. Un soir, elle reçut encore une danse, parce qu'il lui avait trouvé une tache noire au cou. La mâtine osait dire que ce n'était pas un suçon ! oui, elle appelait ça un bleu, tout simplement un bleu que Léonie lui avait fait en jouant. Il lui en donnerait des bleus, il l'empêcherait bien de rouscailler, lorsqu'il devrait lui casser les pattes. D'autres fois, quand il était de belle humeur, il se moquait d'elle, il la blaguait. Vrai ! un joli morceau pour les hommes, une soie tant elle était plate, et avec ça des salières aux épaules, grandes à y fourrer le poing ! Nana, battue pour les vilaines choses qu'elle n'avait pas commises, traînée dans la crudité des accusations abominables de son père, montrait la soumission sournoise et furieuse des bêtes traquées.","But one day, in the rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere, the button manufacturer had dared to put his nose between the niece and the aunt, to murmur things that were not to be said. And Madame Lerat, frightened, repeating that she was no longer even at peace with herself, dropped the whole package to her brother. So it was another train. There were pretty hullabaloos at the Coupeaus. First, the zinc worker slapped Nana. What were we teaching him? that beggar was getting into old people! Ah well ! that she should allow herself to be caught outside, she was sure of her business, he would cut her neck rather quickly! Had we ever seen! a brat who took it upon herself to dishonor the family! And he was shaking her, saying, for God's sake! that she had to walk straight, for it would be he who would watch her in the future. As soon as she came home, he visited her, he looked her straight in the face, to guess if she hadn't brought back a mouse in her eye, one of those little kisses that sneak in there without a sound. He sniffed her, turned her around. One evening she received another dance, because he had found a black spot on her neck. The mastiff dared to say that it was not a hickey! yes, she called it a bruise, quite simply a bruise that Léonie had given her while playing. He would give him bruises, he would prevent him from grumbling when he had to break his legs. Other times, when he was in a good mood, he made fun of her, he joked about her. True ! a pretty piece for men, a silk it was so flat, and with that salt cellars on the shoulders, big enough to stick your fist in! Nana, beaten for the ugly things she had not committed, dragged along in the crudity of her father's abominable accusations, showed the sly and furious submission of hunted animals.","One day, however, he deliberately walked between the aunt and the niece and said something to Nana in a low voice. This frightened Mme Lerat, who went at once to her brother and told him the whole story, whereupon he flew into a violent rage, shook the girl until her teeth chattered and talked to her as if she were the vilest of the vile.","One day, however, in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere the button manufacturer ventured to poke his nose between the aunt and the niece to whisper some things which ought not to have been said. Thereupon Madame Lerat was so frightened that she declared she no longer felt able to handle the matter and she told the whole business to her brother. Then came another row. There were some pretty rumpuses in the Coupeaus’ room. To begin with, the zinc-worker gave Nana a hiding. What was that he learnt? The hussy was flirting with old men. All right. Only let her be caught philandering out of doors again, she’d be done for; he, her father, would cut off her head in a jiffy. Had the like ever been seen before! A dirty nose who thought of beggaring her family! Thereupon he shook her, declaring in God’s name that she’d have to walk straight, for he’d watch her himself in future. He now looked her over every night when she came in, even going so far as to sniff at her and make her turn round before him. One evening she got another hiding because he discovered a mark on her neck that he maintained was the mark of a kiss. Nana insisted it was a bruise that Leonie had given her when they were having a bit of a rough-house. Yet at other times her father would tease her, saying she was certainly a choice morsel for men. Nana began to display the sullen submissiveness of a trapped animal. She was raging inside."
"- Hein ? répéta Gervaise, vous ne seriez pas si grasse, chez eux ? Et pas de café, pas de tabac, aucune douceur ! ? Dites, est-ce qu'ils vous auraient mis deux matelas à votre lit ?","- Eh ? repeated Gervaise, you wouldn't be so fat at home? And no coffee, no tobacco, no sweets! ? Say, did they put two mattresses on your bed?","""You certainly would have weighed some pounds less with her,"" continued Gervaise. "" No coffee, no tobacco, no sweets. And do you imagine that they would have put two mattresses on your bed?""","“Ah!” continued Gervaise, “you wouldn’t be so fat, would you, if you were living with them? And no coffee, no snuff, no little luxuries of any sort! Tell me, would they have given you two mattresses to your bed?”"
"- Il a raison, ce monsieur, dit Gervaise dans l'omnibus qui les ramenait rue de la Goutte-d'Or.","""He's right, this gentleman,"" said Gervaise in the omnibus that was taking them back to rue de la Goutte-d'Or.","""He is right,"" said Gervaise as they took their seats in the omnibus.","“The gentleman’s right,” said Gervaise in the omnibus which was taking them back to the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or."
"- Eh bien ! moi, je puis la voir, je passerai de l'autre côté de la rue, reprit Virginie, qui venait encore de pincer le chapelier d'une main féroce. Oui, le rouge me monterait au front, d'être saluée en public par une de ces filles ? Ce n'est pas parce que vous êtes là, madame Coupeau, mais votre fille est une jolie pourriture. Poisson en ramasse tous les jours qui valent davantage.","- Well ! I can see her, I'll go to the other side of the street, resumed Virginie, who had just pinched the hatter again with a fierce hand. Yes, would the red go to my forehead, to be greeted in public by one of these girls? It's not because you're here, Madame Coupeau, but your daughter is a pretty rotten thing. Fish picks up more every day that are worth more.","""I would not have looked at her,"" said Virginie. ""I sincerely trust, if I should meet her, that she would not speak to me for, really, it would mortify me beyond expression. I am sorry for you, Madame Gervaise, but the truth is that Poisson arrests every day a dozen just such girls.""","“Well, if I saw her, I should go over to the other side of the street,” interposed Virginie, who had just pinched the hatter again most ferociously. “It isn’t because you are there, Madame Coupeau, but your daughter is rotten to the core. Why, every day Poisson arrests girls who are better than she is.”"
"- Ah bien ! non, merci ! s'il n'y a que moi ! dit-il tranquillement. Pour me faire griffer l'œil comme l'autre jour, n'est-ce pas ? ? Je ne suis pas ici pour ça, j'aurais trop de besogne ? N'ayez pas peur, allez ! Ça leur fait du bien, une petite saignée. Ça les attendrit.","- Ah well ! no thanks ! if it's just me! he said quietly. To scratch my eye like the other day, right? ? I'm not here for that, would I have too much work? Don't be afraid, come on! It does them good, a little bloodletting. It softens them.","Come and help us separate them, or you can do it yourself."" ""No, thank you,"" he answered quietly. ""I don't propose to have my own eyes scratched out! I am not here for that. Let them alone! It will do them no harm to let a little of their hot blood out!""","“Oh, no! thank you, not if I know it,” said he coolly. “To get my eye scratched like I did the other day, I suppose! I’m not here for that sort of thing; I have enough to do without that. Don’t be afraid, a little bleeding does ’em good; it’ll soften ’em.”"
"- Ils vous attendent, lui dit Coupeau, pendant qu'ils faisaient le tour par la rue des Poissonniers. Oh ! ils commencent à s'habituer à l'idée de me voir marié. Ce soir, ils ont l'air très gentil ? Et puis, si vous n'avez jamais vu faire des chaînes d'or, ça vous amusera à regarder. Ils ont justement une commande pressée pour lundi.","""They're expecting you,"" said Coupeau to him, as they walked around the Rue des Poissonniers. Oh ! they're getting used to the idea of me being married. Tonight, they look very nice? Besides, if you've never seen chains of gold made, it'll amuse you to watch. They just have a rush order for Monday.","""They expect you,"" said Coupeau as they walked along the street, ""and they have become accustomed to the idea of seeing me married. They are really quite amiable tonight. Then, too, if you have never seen a gold chain made you will be much amused in watching it. They have an order for Monday.""","“They’re expecting you,” said Coupeau to her, as they went round by the Rue des Poissonniers. “Oh! they’re beginning to get used to the idea of my being married. They seem nice indeed, to-night. And you know if you’ve never seen gold chains made, it’ll amuse you to watch them. They just happen to have a pressing order for Monday.”"
"Gervaise s'entêta encore à la fenêtre pendant deux mortelles heures, jusqu'à huit heures. Les boutiques s'étaient ouvertes. Le flot de blouses descendant des hauteurs avait cessé ; et seuls quelques retardataires franchissaient la barrière à grandes enjambées. Chez les marchands de vin, les mêmes hommes, debout, continuaient à boire, à tousser et à cracher. Aux ouvriers avaient succédé les ouvrières, les brunisseuses, les modistes, les fleuristes, se serrant dans leurs minces vêtements, trottant le long des boulevards extérieurs ; elles allaient par bandes de trois ou quatre, causaient vivement, avec de légers rires et des regards luisants jetés autour d'elles ; de loin en loin, une, toute seule, maigre, l'air pâle et sérieux, suivait le mur de l'octroi, en évitant les coulées d'ordures. Puis, les employés étaient passés, soufflant dans leurs doigts, mangeant leur pain d'un sou en marchant ; des jeunes gens efflanqués, aux habits trop courts, aux yeux battus, tout brouillés de sommeil ; de petits vieux qui roulaient sur leurs pieds, la face blême, usée par les longues heures du bureau, regardant leur montre pour régler leur marche à quelques secondes près. Et les boulevards avaient pris leur paix du matin ; les rentiers du voisinage se promenaient au soleil ; les mères, en cheveux, en jupes sales, berçaient dans leurs bras des enfants au maillot, qu'elles changeaient sur les bancs ; toute une marmaille mal mouchée, débraillée, se bousculait, se traînait par terre, au milieu de piaulements, de rires et de pleurs. Alors, Gervaise se sentit étouffer, saisie d'un vertige d'angoisse, à bout d'espoir ; il lui semblait que tout était fini, que les temps étaient finis, que Lantier ne rentrerait plus jamais. Elle allait, les regards perdus, des vieux abattoirs noirs de leur massacre et de leur puanteur, à l'hôpital neuf, blafard, montrant, par les trous encore béants de ses rangées de fenêtres, des salles nues où la mort devait faucher. En face d'elle, derrière le mur de l'octroi, le ciel éclatant, le lever de soleil qui grandissait au-dessus du réveil énorme de Paris, l'éblouissait. La jeune femme était assise sur une chaise, les mains abandonnées, ne pleurant plus, lorsque Lantier entra tranquillement.","Gervaise persisted at the window for another two mortal hours, until eight o'clock. The shops had opened. The stream of smocks descending from the heights had ceased; and only a few stragglers strode through the barrier. At the wine merchants, the same men, standing, continued to drink, cough and spit. The workmen had succeeded the working women, the burnishers, the milliners, the florists, huddled in their thin clothes, trotting along the outer boulevards; they went in bands of three or four, chatting briskly, with light laughter and sparkling glances cast around them; From time to time, one, all alone, thin, looking pale and serious, followed the wall of the granting, avoiding the streams of garbage. Then the clerks passed by, blowing their fingers, eating their penny bread as they walked; emaciated young people, with too short clothes, sunken eyes, all sluggish with sleep; little old people rolling on their feet, their faces pale, worn out by the long hours of the office, looking at their watches to adjust their pace to within a few seconds. And the boulevards had taken on their morning peace; the rentiers of the neighborhood strolled in the sun; the mothers, in their hair, in dirty skirts, cradled in their arms children in bathing suits, whom they changed on the benches; a whole bunch of badly snuffed, disheveled children jostled each other, crawled on the ground, amid squealing, laughing and crying. Then Gervaise felt suffocated, seized with a dizziness of anguish, out of hope; it seemed to him that everything was over, that time was over, that Lantier would never return. She went, her gaze lost, from the old slaughterhouses, black with their massacre and their stench, to the new, pale hospital, showing, through the still gaping holes in its rows of windows, bare rooms where death was to mow down. In front of her, behind the wall of the granting, the dazzling sky, the sunrise which grew above the enormous awakening of Paris, dazzled her. The young woman was seated on a chair, her hands abandoned, crying no longer, when Lantier quietly entered.","But Gervaise did not move. She remained in the same spot for two mortal hours, until the clock struck eight. The shops were now all open. The procession in blouses had long ceased, and only an occasional one hurried along. At the wineshops, however, there was the same crowd of men drinking, spitting and coughing. The workmen in the street had given place to the workwomen. Milliners' apprentices, florists, burnishers, who with thin shawls drawn closely around them came in bands of three or four, talking eagerly, with gay laughs and quick glances. Occasionally one solitary figure was seen, a pale-faced, serious woman, who walked rapidly, neither looking to the right nor to the left. Then came the clerks, blowing on their fingers to warm them, eating a roll as they walked; young men, lean and tall, with clothing they had outgrown and with eyes heavy with sleep; old men, who moved along with measured steps, occasionally pulling out their watches, but able, from many years' practice, to time their movements almost to a second. The boulevards at last were comparatively quiet. The inhabitants were sunning themselves. Women with untidy hair and soiled petticoats were nursing their babies in the open air, and an occasional dirty-faced brat fell into the gutter or rolled over with shrieks of pain or joy. Gervaise felt faint and ill; all hope was gone. It seemed to her that all was over and that Lantier would come no more. She looked from the dingy slaughterhouses, black with their dirt and loathsome odor, on to the new and staring hospital and into the rooms consecrated to disease and death. As yet the windows were not in, and there was nothing to impede her view of the large, empty wards. The sun shone directly in her face and blinded her. She was sitting on a chair with her arms dropping drearily at her side but not weeping, when Lantier quietly opened the door and walked in.","Gervaise still obstinately remained at the window during two mortal hours, till eight o’clock. Now all the shops had opened. Only a few work men were still hurrying along. The working girls now filled the boulevard: metal polishers, milliners, flower sellers, shivering in their thin clothing. In small groups they chattered gaily, laughing and glancing here and there. Occasionally there would be one girl by herself, thin, pale, serious-faced, picking her way along the city wall among the puddles and the filth. After the working girls, the office clerks came past, breathing upon their chilled fingers and munching penny rolls. Some of them are gaunt young fellows in ill-fitting suits, their tired eyes still fogged from sleep. Others are older men, stooped and tottering, with faces pale and drawn from long hours of office work and glancing nervously at their watches for fear of arriving late. In time the Boulevards settle into their usual morning quiet. Old folks come out to stroll in the sun. Tired young mothers in bedraggled skirts cuddle babies in their arms or sit on a bench to change diapers. Children run, squealing and laughing, pushing and shoving. Then Gervaise felt herself choking, dizzy with anguish, all hopes gone; it seemed to her that everything was ended, even time itself, and that Lantier would return no more. Her eyes vacantly wandered from the old slaughter-house, foul with butchery and with stench, to the new white hospital which, through the yawning openings of its ranges of windows, disclosed the naked wards, where death was preparing to mow. In front of her on the other side of the octroi wall the bright heavens dazzled her, with the rising sun which rose higher and higher over the vast awaking city. The young woman was seated on a chair, no longer crying, and with her hands abandoned on her lap, when Lantier quietly entered the room."
"- Dites donc, est-ce qu'il ne jacasse pas tout bas ? ? Hein ? vous entendez, qu'est-ce que c'est ?","- Hey, isn't he chattering quietly? ? Eh ? you hear, what is it?","""What is he saying? Hark!",“Isn’t he jabbering to himself? Eh! don’t you hear? What’s it about?
"Maman Coupeau avait aligné cinq verres sur un coin libre de l'établi. Alors, les ouvrières lâchèrent leur travail. La patronne versait toujours le café elle-même, après avoir mis deux morceaux de sucre dans chaque verre. C'était l'heure attendue de la journée. Ce jour-là, comme chacune prenait son verre et s'accroupissait sur un petit banc, devant la mécanique, la porte de la rue s'ouvrit, Virginie entra, toute frissonnante.","Maman Coupeau had lined up five glasses on a free corner of the workbench. Then, the workers let go of their work. The landlady always poured the coffee herself, after putting two sugar cubes in each glass. It was the expected time of day. That day, as everyone was taking their glass and squatting on a little bench in front of the mechanics, the street door opened and Virginie came in, shivering all over.","Mamma Coupeau brought in the coffee, and as each one of the women took a cup with a sigh of enjoyment the street door opened and Virginie came in with a rush of cold air.","Mother Coupeau had placed five glasses on a corner of the work-table that was free. The women now left their work. The mistress always poured out the coffee herself after putting two lumps of sugar into each glass. It was the moment that they all looked forward to. On this occasion, as each one took her glass and squatted down on a little stool in front of the stove, the shop-door opened. Virginie entered, shivering all over."
"Coupeau ne connaissait qu'un remède, se coller sa chopine de cric, un coup de bâton dans l'estomac, qui le mettait debout. Tous les matins, il guérissait ainsi sa pituite. La mémoire avait filé depuis longtemps, son crâne était vide ; et il ne se trouvait pas plus tôt sur les pieds, qu'il blaguait la maladie. Il n'avait jamais été malade. Oui, il en était à ce point où l'on crève en disant qu'on se porte bien. D'ailleurs, il déménageait aussi pour le reste. Quand Nana rentrait, après des six semaines de promenade, il semblait croire qu'elle revenait d'une commission dans le quartier. Souvent, accrochée au bras d'un monsieur, elle le rencontrait et rigolait, sans qu'il la reconnût. Enfin, il ne comptait plus, elle se serait assise sur lui, si elle n'avait pas trouvé de chaise.","Coupeau knew only one remedy, stick his pint of jack, a blow of a stick in the stomach, which put him on his feet. Every morning, he cured his pituite in this way. The memory had long since slipped away, his skull was empty; and no sooner was he on his feet than he joked about illness. He had never been sick. Yes, it was at this point where one bursts by saying that one is doing well. Besides, he also moved for the rest. When Nana came home after a six-week walk, he seemed to think she was coming back from an errand in the neighborhood. Often, clinging to the arm of a gentleman, she met him and laughed, without him recognizing her. Anyway, he no longer counted, she would have sat on him, if she hadn't found a chair.","Coupeau knew but one remedy for all this, and that was a good stout morning dram. His memory had long since fled; his brain had softened. When Nana appeared after an absence of six weeks he thought she had been on an errand around the corner. She met him in the street, too, very often now, without fear, for he passed without recognizing her.","Coupeau knew only one remedy, to toss down a pint of spirits; a whack in his stomach, which set him on his feet again. This was how he doctored his gripes of a morning. His memory had left him long ago, his brain was empty; and he no sooner found himself on his feet than he poked fun at illness. He had never been ill. Yes, he had got to the point when a fellow kicks the bucket declaring that he’s quite well. And his wits were going a-wool-gathering in other respects too. When Nana came home after gadding about for six weeks or so he seemed to fancy she had returned from doing some errand in the neighborhood. Often when she was hanging on an acquaintance’s arm she met him and laughed at him without his recognizing her. In short, he no longer counted for anything; she might have sat down on him if she had been at a loss for a chair."
"- Laissez-la donc, murmura madame Boche. Vous n'allez peut-être pas vous prendre aux cheveux ? Quand je vous dis qu'il n'y a rien ! Ce n'est pas elle, là !","""Leave her alone then,"" murmured Madame Boche. Maybe you're not going to get caught in your hair? When I tell you that there is nothing! That's not her!","""Let her be,"" murmured Mme Boche. ""She is not the one, now I tell you!""","“Leave her alone,” whispered Madame Boche. “You’re not going to pull each other’s hair out, I hope. When I tell you there’s nothing to it! It isn’t her, anyhow!”"
"Claude regarda son frère, hésita, ne sachant plus. Puis, il reprit d'un trait :","Claude looked at his brother, hesitated, not knowing anymore. Then he resumed in a nutshell:",Claude looked at his brother and hesitated. Then he exclaimed:,"Claude looked at his brother, hesitated, no longer recollecting. Then he resumed all in a breath: “Papa’s gone away."
"- Vieille drogue, tu as changé de litre ! ? Tu sais, ce n'est pas avec moi qu'il faut maquiller ton vitriol !","- Old drug, you changed litre! ? You know, it is not with me that it is necessary to make up your vitriol!","Returning to the counter, he renewed his attack on Father Colombe, whom he accused of adulterating his liquors.","“Vile druggist, you’ve changed the bottle! You know it ’s no good your trying to palm your cheap stuff off on me.”"
"- Ah ! ma pauvre femme ! dit Coupeau en embrassant Gervaise. Et moi qui rigolais, il n'y a pas une heure, pendant que tu criais aux petits pâtés ! ? Dis donc, tu n'es pas embarrassée, tu vous lâches ça, le temps d'éternuer.","- Oh! my poor wife! said Coupeau, embracing Gervaise. And me who was laughing, not an hour ago, while you were shouting at the little pies! ? Say, you're not embarrassed, you let go of that, time to sneeze.","""My dear, it is a girl."" ""All right!"" said the tinworker, jesting to hide his real emotion.","“Ah, my poor wife!” said Coupeau, kissing Gervaise. “And I was joking only an hour ago, whilst you were crying with pain! I say, you don’t make much fuss about it—the time to sneeze"
"Pourtant, l'oie était découpée. Le sergent de ville, après avoir laissé la société admirer le bonnet d'évêque pendant quelques minutes, venait d'abattre les morceaux et de les ranger autour du plat. On pouvait se servir. Mais les dames, qui dégrafaient leur robe, se plaignaient de la chaleur. Coupeau cria qu'on était chez soi, qu'il emmiellait les voisins ; et il ouvrit toute grande la porte de la rue, la noce continua au milieu du roulement des fiacres et de la bousculade des passants sur les trottoirs. Alors, les mâchoires reposées, un nouveau trou dans l'estomac, on recommença à dîner, on tomba sur l'oie furieusement. Rien qu'à attendre et à regarder découper la bête, disait ce farceur de Boche, ça lui avait fait descendre la blanquette et l'épinée dans les mollets.","Still, the goose was cut up. The sergent de ville, after letting the company admire the bishop's bonnet for a few minutes, had just cut down the pieces and arranged them around the dish. We could help ourselves. But the ladies, who undid their dresses, complained of the heat. Coupeau called out that we were at home, that he was honeycombing the neighbors; and he opened the street door wide, the wedding continued amidst the rumbling of cabs and the jostling of passers-by on the sidewalks. So, jaws rested, a new hole in the stomach, we began to dine again, we fell on the goose furiously. Just waiting and watching the animal be cut up, said that joker Boche, had made the blanquette and the spine go down in his calves.","Gervaise devoured large slices of the breast, hardly speaking, but a little ashamed of her own gluttony in the presence of Goujet.","The carving of the goose was now complete. When the ladies complained that they were getting rather warm, Coupeau opened the door to the street and the gaiety continued against the background of cabs rattling down the street and pedestrians bustling along the pavement. The goose was attacked furiously by the rested jaws. Boche remarked that just having to wait and watch the goose being carved had been enough to make the veal and pork slide down to his ankles."
"Sur les tas de sable, entre les bancs, des gamins jouaient encore, dans la nuit croissante. Le défilé continuait, les ouvrières passaient, trottant, se dépêchant, pour rattraper le temps perdu aux étalages ; une grande, arrêtée, laissait sa main dans celle d'un garçon, qui l'accompagnait à trois portes de chez elle ; d'autres, en se quittant, se donnaient des rendez-vous pour la nuit, au Grand Salon de la folie ou à la Boule Noire. Au milieu des groupes, des ouvriers à façon s'en retournaient, leurs toilettes pliées sous le bras. Un fumiste, attelé à des bricoles, tirant une voiture remplie de gravats, manquait de se faire écraser par un omnibus. Cependant, parmi la foule plus rare, couraient des femmes en cheveux, redescendues après avoir allumé le feu, et se hâtant pour le dîner ; elles bousculaient le monde, se jetaient chez les boulangers et les charcutiers, repartaient sans traîner, avec des provisions dans les mains. Il y avait des petites filles de huit ans, envoyées en commission, qui s'en allaient le long des boutiques, serrant sur leur poitrine de grands pains de quatre livres aussi hauts qu'elles, pareils à de belles poupées jaunes, et qui s'oubliaient pendant des cinq minutes devant des images, la joue appuyée contre leurs grands pains. Puis, le flot s'épuisait, les groupes s'espaçaient, le travail était rentré ; et, dans les flamboiements du gaz, après la journée finie, montait la sourde revanche des paresses et des noces qui s'éveillaient.","On the heaps of sand, between the benches, children were still playing, in the gathering darkness. The procession continued, the workers passed, trotting, hurrying, to make up for the time lost at the displays; a tall one, stopped, left her hand in that of a boy, who accompanied her three doors down from her house; others, when they parted, made appointments for the night, at the Grand Salon de la Folie or at the Boule Noire. In the midst of the groups, custom workers were returning, their toilets folded under their arms. A humbug, harnessed to odds and ends, pulling a car full of rubble, almost got run over by an omnibus. Meanwhile, among the more sparse crowd ran women with their hair down, having lit the fire, and hurrying for dinner; they jostled people, rushed to bakers and butchers, left without delay, with provisions in their hands. There were little girls of eight years old, sent on errands, who went along the shops, clutching to their breasts large loaves of four pounds as high as they were, like beautiful yellow dolls, and who forgot for five minutes in front of the images, their cheeks pressed against their large buns. Then the tide died out, the groups grew thinner, work had started; and, in the blazes of the gas, after the day was over, rose the dull revenge of laziness and waking nuptials.","She passed crowds of workwomen with little parcels in their hands and children who had been sent to the baker's, carrying four-pound loaves of bread as tall as themselves, which looked like shining brown dolls.","The night was gathering, but children were still playing on the heaps of sand between the benches. The march past continued, the workgirls went by, trotting along and hurrying to make up for the time they had lost in looking in at the shop windows; one tall girl, who had stopped, left her hand in that of a big fellow, who accompanied her to within three doors of her home; others as they parted from each other, made appointments for the night at the “Great Hall of Folly” or the “Black Ball.” In the midst of the groups, piece-workmen went by, carrying their clothes folded under their arms. A chimney sweep, harnessed with leather braces, was drawing a cart along, and nearly got himself crushed by an omnibus. Among the crowd which was now growing scantier, there were several women running with bare heads; after lighting the fire, they had come downstairs again and were hastily making their purchases for dinner; they jostled the people they met, darted into the bakers’ and the pork butchers’, and went off again with all despatch, their provisions in their hands. There were little girls of eight years old, who had been sent out on errands, and who went along past the shops, pressing long loaves of four pounds’ weight, as tall as they were themselves, against their chests, as if these loaves had been beautiful yellow dolls; at times these little ones forgot themselves for five minutes or so, in front of some pictures in a shop window, and rested their cheeks against the bread. Then the flow subsided, the groups became fewer and farther between, the working classes had gone home; and as the gas blazed now that the day’s toil was over, idleness and amusement seemed to wake up."
"Alors, le chapelier se montra très pratique. En cédant le bail, on obtiendrait sans doute du nouveau locataire les deux termes en retard. Et il se risqua à parler des Poisson, il rappela que Virginie cherchait un magasin ; la boutique lui conviendrait peut-être. Il se souvenait à présent de lui en avoir entendu souhaiter une toute semblable. Mais la blanchisseuse, au nom de Virginie, avait subitement repris son calme. On verrait ; on parlait toujours de planter là son chez soi dans la colère, seulement la chose ne semblait pas si facile, quand on réfléchissait.","Then the hatter proved to be very practical. By assigning the lease, we would probably obtain from the new tenant the two late terms. And he ventured to speak of the Poissons, he recalled that Virginie was looking for a store; the shop might suit him. Now he remembered hearing her wish for a very similar one. But the laundress, in the name of Virginie, had suddenly regained her composure. We will see ; we always talked about planting our home there in anger, only the thing did not seem so easy, when we thought about it.","Then Lantier became serious and businesslike. He spoke openly of Virginie, who, he said, was looking for a shop; in fact, he now remembered having heard her say that she would like just such a one as this.","Then the hatter became very practical. On giving up the lease one would no doubt get the new tenant to be responsible for the two overdue quarters. And he ventured to mention the Poissons, he reminded them that Virginie was looking for a shop; theirs would perhaps suit her. He remembered that he had heard her say she longed for one just like it. But when Virginie’s name was mentioned the laundress suddenly regained her composure. We’ll see how things go along. When you’re angry you always talk of quitting, but it isn’t so easy when you just stop to think about it."
"Puis, revenant sur l'idée qu'elle caressait d'un bonheur parfait :","Then, returning to the idea she cherished of perfect happiness:","Then returning to the idea which had struck her as the acme of human happiness, she said:","Then, returning to the idea she nursed of a perfect happiness, she resumed: “Now, ain’t I right?"
"Gervaise tâchait vainement de le calmer. Il s'étalait dans ses guenilles, il tapait sur sa blouse, en gueulant :","Gervaise tried in vain to calm him. He was spreading out in his rags, he was banging his blouse, yelling:","Gervaise endeavored to calm her husband, who, however, tapped his ragged breast and repeated loudly:","Gervaise tried to calm him, but in vain. He drew himself up in his rags, in full view, and struck his blouse, roaring: “There’s a man’s chest under that!”"
"- Tiens ! c'est vous, madame Boche ! ? Oh ! j'ai un tas de besogne, aujourd'hui !","- Take ! it's you, Madame Boche! ? Oh ! I have a lot of work today!","Gervaise leaned out. ""Ah, is it you, Madame Boche! Yes, I am up early, for I have much to do today.""","“Why! It’s you, Madame Boche! Oh! I’ve got a lot of work to-day!”"
"- Eh bien, quoi ! bégaya-t-il, on ne mange personne dans notre partie ? J'en vaux un autre, allez, ma petite ? Sans doute que j'ai bu un coup ! Quand l'ouvrage donne, faut bien se graisser les roues. Ce n'est pas vous, ni la compagnie, qui auriez descendu le particulier de six cents livres que nous avons amené à deux du quatrième sur le trottoir, et sans le casser encore ? Moi, j'aime les gens rigolos.","- Well, what! he stammered, we don't eat anyone in our part? I'm worth another, come on, my little one? No doubt I had a drink! When the work gives, you have to grease your wheels. Wasn't it you or the company who lowered the six hundred-pound particular that we brought two from the fourth to the sidewalk, and without breaking it yet? Me, I like funny people.","But Father Bazonge was talking to Gervaise. ""I am not going to eat you, little one,"" he said. ""I have drunk too much, I know very well, but when the work is done the machinery should be greased a little now and then.""","“Well, what!” hiccoughed he, “we ain’t going to eat any one. I’m as good as another any day, my little woman. No doubt I’ve had a drop! When work’s plentiful one must grease the wheels. It’s not you, nor your friends, who would have carried down the stiff ’un of forty-seven stone whom I and a pal brought from the fourth floor to the pavement, and without smashing him too. I like jolly people.”"
"Dans le silence, M. Madinier causait politique.","In the silence, M. Madinier was talking politics.",Madinier talked politics.,"In the partial silence, Monsieur Madinier was talking politics."
"Comme il faisait bon, là-dedans ! La forge flambait, allumait l'étroit atelier de sa flamme blanche, pendant que madame Lorilleux mettait à recuire une pelote de fil d'or. Lorilleux, devant son établi, suait, tant il avait chaud, en train de souder des maillons au chalumeau. Et ça sentait bon, une soupe aux choux mijotait sur le poêle, exhalant une vapeur qui retournait le cœur de Gervaise et la faisait s'évanouir.","How good it was in there! The forge was blazing, lighting up the narrow workshop with its white flame, while Madame Lorilleux was annealing a ball of gold wire. Lorilleux, in front of his workbench, was sweating, he was so hot, welding links with a blowtorch. And it smelled good, cabbage soup was simmering on the stove, exhaling a vapor that made Gervaise's heart ache and made her faint.","How good it was there! Warm and bright with the glow of the forge. And Gervaise smelled the soup, too, and it made her feel faint and sick.","How warm and nice it was inside. The forge was blazing, its white flame lighting up the narrow workroom, whilst Madame Lorilleux set a coil of gold wire to heat. Lorilleux, in front of his worktable, was perspiring with the warmth as he soldered the links of a chain together. And it smelt nice. Some cabbage soup was simmering on the stove, exhaling a steam which turned Gervaise’s heart topsy-turvy, and almost made her faint."
"Au plus fort de sa crise, cet hiver-là, une après-midi que madame Lorilleux et madame Lerat s'étaient rencontrées devant son lit, maman Coupeau cligna les yeux, pour leur dire de se pencher. Elle pouvait à peine parler. Elle souffla, à voix basse :","At the height of her crisis that winter, one afternoon when Madame Lorilleux and Madame Lerat had met in front of her bed, Maman Coupeau blinked her eyes to tell them to bend over. She could barely speak. She whispered in a low voice:",Then in a little while she turned against the Lorilleuxs and talked of them in the most bitter manner.,"When at her worst that winter, one afternoon, when Madame Lorilleux and Madame Lerat had met at her bedside, mother Coupeau winked her eye as a signal to them to lean over her. She could scarcely speak. She rather hissed than said in a low voice:"
- Je comprends ça.,- I understand that.,"""Of course. I might have known that!""",“I can understand that.”
"- Dame ! répondit Gervaise, ça ne se ferait pas tout seul ? Non, ne vous salissez pas les mains. Vous voyez, tout est prêt. Il n'y a plus que le potage ?","- Lady ! answered Gervaise, wouldn't it happen by itself? No, don't get your hands dirty. You see, everything is ready. There's nothing left but the soup?","""No indeed,"" answered Gervaise; ""I am nearly through."" The ladies covered the bed with their shawls and bonnets and then went into the shop that they might be out of the way and talked through the open door with much noise and loud laughing.","“Well, you know,” replied Gervaise, “it wouldn’t prepare itself. No, don’t dirty your hands. You see everything’s ready. There’s only the soup to warm.”"
- Tais-toi ! ? Il n'y a pas besoin de tant d'explications.,- Shut your mouth ! ? There is no need for so many explanations.,Gervaise pushed him aside and walked up to Nana and gave her two cuffs on her ears.,"Gervaise, whose teeth were tight set, pushed him aside, exclaiming, “Shut up. There’s no need of so much explanation.”"
"- C'est ça, oh ! c'est ça ! ? Ah ! cette Sophie, est-elle sale !","- That's it, oh! that's it ! ? Ah! this Sophie, is she dirty!",""" But Augustine sharply answered that she did not like the old man.","Oh! that’s it,” she stammered. “How dirty that Sophie is!”"
"- Souviens-toi que le producteur n'est pas un esclave, mais que quiconque n'est pas un producteur est un frelon.","- Remember that the producer is not a slave, but anyone who is not a producer is a hornet.","Finally it was decided that Etienne should go, and when the morning of his departure arrived Lantier read his son a long lecture and then sent him off, and the house settled down into new habits.","“Never forget that a workingman is not a slave, and that whoever is not a workingman is a lazy drone.”"
"- Monsieur, écoutez donc ?","- Sir, are you listening?","""Sir, please listen!""","And as she suddenly saw one who, on the contrary, was coming slowly towards her under the trees, she approached him and again said: “Sir, just listen—”"
"Les ouvrières ne se pressèrent pas, engourdies d'une torpeur de paresse, les bras abandonnés sur leurs jupes, tenant toujours d'une main leurs verres vides, où un peu de marc de café restait. Elles continuèrent de causer.","The workers did not hurry, numb with a torpor of laziness, their arms abandoned on their skirts, still holding in one hand their empty glasses, in which a little coffee grounds remained. They continued to talk.","The women did not move; they were lulled to apathy by the heat, and Gervaise herself found it very difficult to resume her labors.","The workwomen, slow from the heat and general laziness, didn’t hurry themselves, but went right on talking, gossiping about other people they had known."
"Gervaise ne répondit pas. Elle n'était pas trop mal avec les Lorilleux, cette semaine-là. Mais la demande des dix sous lui restait dans la gorge, parce qu'elle venait d'apercevoir Boche, carrément assis près du poêle, en train de faire des cancans. Il avait un air de se ficher du monde, cet animal ! Il riait comme un cul, le trou de la bouche arrondi, et les joues tellement bouffies qu'elles lui cachaient le nez ; un vrai cul, enfin !","Gervaise did not answer. She wasn't too bad with the Lorilleuxs that week. But the request for the ten sous stuck in her throat, because she had just seen Boche, squarely seated near the stove, gossiping. He had an air of not caring about the world, this animal! He was laughing like an ass, the hole in his mouth rounded, and his cheeks so puffy that they hid his nose; a real ass, finally!","Gervaise hesitated. The application for ten sous stuck in her throat, because she saw Boche seated by the stove.","Gervaise did not answer for a moment. She had recently been on fairly good terms with the Lorilleuxs, but she saw Boche sitting by the stove. He seemed very much at home, telling funny stories."
"Nana reprit les queues de violettes qu'elle roulait, et tout l'atelier s'occupa de l'homme. C'était un monsieur bien vêtu, en paletot, d'une cinquantaine d'années ; il avait une face blême, très sérieuse et très digne, avec un collier de barbe grise, correctement taillé. Pendant une heure, il resta devant la boutique d'un herboriste, levant les yeux sur les jalousies de l'atelier. Les fleuristes poussaient des petits rires, qui s'étouffaient dans le bruit de la rue ; et elles se courbaient, très affairées au-dessus de l'ouvrage, avec des coups d'œil, pour ne pas perdre de vue le monsieur.","Nana picked up the tails of violets she was rolling, and the whole workshop took care of the man. He was a well-dressed gentleman in an overcoat, about fifty years old; he had a pale face, very serious and very dignified, with a collar of gray beard, properly trimmed. For an hour he stood in front of an herbalist's shop, looking up at the blinds of the workshop. The florists uttered little laughs, which were stifled by the noise of the street; and they bent very busy over the work, glancing so as not to lose sight of the gentleman.","Nana took up her violets, and they all began to watch this man. He was well dressed, about fifty, pale and grave. For a full hour he watched the windows. ""Look!"" said Leonie. ""","Nana took up the stems of some violets she was rolling, and the whole workroom turned its attention to the man in question. He was a well-dressed individual wearing a frock coat and he looked about fifty years old. He had a pale face, very serous and dignified in expression, framed round with a well trimmed grey beard. He remained for an hour in front of a herbalist’s shop with his eyes fixed on the Venetian blinds of the workroom. The flower-girls indulged in little bursts of laughter which died away amid the noise of the street, and while leaning forward, to all appearance busy with their work, they glanced askance so as not to lose sight of the gentleman."
"- Hein ? dit-il, tu fais la traînée, bougre de trognon ! Je t'ai entendue danser d'en bas ? Allons, avance ! Plus près, nom de Dieu ! et en face ; je n'ai pas besoin de renifler ton moutardier. Est-ce que je te touche, pour trembler comme un quiqui ? ? Ôte-moi mes souliers.","- Eh ? he said, you're trolling, you bastard! I heard you dancing from downstairs? Come on, move on! Closer, for God's sake! and opposite; I don't need to sniff your mustard pot. Do I touch you, to tremble like a quiqui? ? Take my shoes off.","""What is the matter with you fools? Have you been struck dumb? I heard you all talking and laughing merrily enough before I came in. Where are your tongues now? Here! Take off my shoes!""","“What’s that?” said he. “You’re playing the deuce, eh, you confounded young hussy! I could hear you dancing about from downstairs. Now then, come here! Nearer and full face. I don’t want to sniff you from behind. Am I touching you that you tremble like a mass of giblets? Take my shoes off.”"
"Cette plaisanterie méchante eut un grand succès. Les allusions spirituelles se mirent à pleuvoir : Clémence n'avalait plus une cuillerée de fraises, sans dire qu'elle donnait un coup de fer ; madame Lerat prétendait que le fromage blanc sentait l'amidon ; tandis que madame Lorilleux, entre ses dents, répétait que c'était trouvé, bouffer si vite l'argent, sur les planches où l'on avait eu tant de peine à le gagner. Une tempête de rires et de cris montait.","This wicked joke had a great success. Witty allusions began to rain down: Clemence no longer swallowed a spoonful of strawberries without saying that she was kicking; Madame Lerat claimed that cottage cheese smelled of starch; while Madame Lorilleux, between her teeth, repeated that it was found, to eat the money so quickly, on the boards where it had been so difficult to earn it. A storm of laughter and shouting rose.",A song was proposed—comic songs were a specialty with Boche—and the whole party joined in the chorus.,This malicious joke had a great success. Witty allusions came from all sides. Clemence could not swallow a spoonful of strawberries without saying that it was another shirt ironed; Madame Lerat pretended that the cream cheese smelt of starch; whilst Madame Lorilleux said between her teeth that it was capital fun to gobble up the money so quickly on the very boards on which one had had so much trouble to earn it. There was quite a tempest of shouts and laughter.
"Chez la mère Louis, tout en suçant les petits os des pieds, on tapa de nouveau sur les patrons. Bec-Salé, dit Boit-sans-Soif, racontait qu'il y avait une commande pressée dans sa boîte. Oh ! le singe était coulant pour le quart d'heure ; on pouvait manquer à l'appel, il restait gentil, il devait s'estimer encore bien heureux quand on revenait. D'abord, il n'y avait pas de danger qu'un patron osât jamais flanquer dehors Bec-Salé, dit Boit-sans-Soif, parce qu'on n'en trouvait plus, des cadets de sa capacité. Après les pieds, on mangea une omelette. Chacun but son litre. La mère Louis faisait venir son vin de l'Auvergne, un vin couleur de sang qu'on aurait coupé au couteau. Ça commençait à être drôle, la bordée s'allumait.","At Mother Louis's, while sucking the little bones of her feet, we banged on the bosses again. Bec-Salé, known as Boit-sans-Soif, said that there was a rush order in his box. Oh ! the monkey was sinking for the quarter of an hour; you could be missed, he remained nice, he must still consider himself very happy when you came back. In the first place, there was no danger that a boss would ever dare kick out Salted-Mouth, said Boit-sans-Soif, because there were no more of them, juniors of his capacity. After the feet, we ate an omelette. Everyone drank their liter. Mother Louis brought her wine from Auvergne, a wine the color of blood that you would have cut with a knife. It was starting to be funny, the broadside was lighting up.","They went to a restaurant and ordered a famous repast of pigs' feet, and they sat and sucked the bones and talked about their various employers.","At mother Louis’, whilst they sucked the little bones of the pettitoes, they again fell to abusing the employers. Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst, related that they had a most pressing order to execute at the shop. Oh! the ape was pleasant for the time being. One could be late, and he would say nothing; he no doubt considered himself lucky when one turned up at all. At any rate, no boss would dare to throw Salted-Mouth out the door, because you couldn’t find lads of his capacity any more. After the pettitoes they had an omelet. When each of them had emptied his bottle, Mere Louis brought out some Auvergne wine, thick enough to cut with a knife. The party was really warming up."
"Au milieu de cette existence enragée par la misère, Gervaise souffrait encore des faims qu'elle entendait râler autour d'elle. Ce coin de la maison était le coin des pouilleux, où trois ou quatre ménages semblaient s'être donné le mot pour ne pas avoir du pain tous les jours. Les portes avaient beau s'ouvrir, elles ne lâchaient guère souvent des odeurs de cuisine. Le long du corridor, il y avait un silence de crevaison, et les murs sonnaient creux, comme des ventres vides. Par moments, des danses s'élevaient, des larmes de femmes, des plaintes de mioches affamés, des familles qui se mangeaient pour tromper leur estomac. On était là dans une crampe au gosier générale, bâillant par toutes ces bouches tendues ; et les poitrines se creusaient, rien qu'à respirer cet air, où les moucherons eux-mêmes n'auraient pas pu vivre, faute de nourriture. Mais la grande pitié de Gervaise était surtout le père Bru, dans son trou, sous le petit escalier. Il s'y retirait comme une marmotte, s'y mettait en boule, pour avoir moins froid ; il restait des journées sans bouger, sur un tas de paille. La faim ne le faisait même plus sortir, car c'était bien inutile d'aller gagner dehors de l'appétit, lorsque personne ne l'avait invité en ville. Quand il ne reparaissait pas de trois ou quatre jours, les voisins poussaient sa porte, regardaient s'il n'était pas fini. Non, il vivait quand même, pas beaucoup, mais un peu, d'un œil seulement ; jusqu'à la mort qui l'oubliait ! Gervaise, dès qu'elle avait du pain, lui jetait des croûtes. Si elle devenait mauvaise et détestait les hommes, à cause de son mari, elle plaignait toujours bien sincèrement les animaux ; et le père Bru, ce pauvre vieux, qu'on laissait crever, parce qu'il ne pouvait plus tenir un outil, était comme un chien pour elle, un bête hors de service, dont les équarrisseurs ne voulaient même pas acheter la peau ni la graisse. Elle en gardait un poids sur le cœur, de le savoir continuellement là, de l'autre côté du corridor, abandonné de Dieu et des hommes, se nourrissant uniquement de lui-même, retournant à la taille d'un enfant, ratatiné et desséché à la manière des oranges qui se racornissent sur les cheminées.","In the midst of this existence enraged by misery, Gervaise still suffered from the hunger pangs she heard grumbling around her. This corner of the house was the lousy corner, where three or four households seemed to have given each other the word not to have bread every day. Even though the doors opened, they rarely let out cooking smells. Along the corridor there was a dead silence, and the walls rang hollow, like empty bellies. At times, dances arose, women's tears, complaints of starving kids, families who ate each other to deceive their stomachs. We were there in a general cramp in the throat, yawning through all these outstretched mouths; and the chests hollowed out, just from breathing this air, where the gnats themselves could not have lived, for lack of food. But Gervaise's great pity was above all old Bru, in his hole, under the little staircase. He withdrew into it like a groundhog, curled up in it, to be less cold; he stayed for days without moving, on a pile of straw. Hunger didn't even make him go out anymore, because there was no point in going outside to work up an appetite when no one had invited him into town. When he did not appear for three or four days, the neighbors pushed open his door, looked to see if he was not finished. No, he lived all the same, not much, but a little, with one eye only; until death which forgot it! Gervaise, as soon as she had bread, threw crusts at it. If she became bad and hated men, because of her husband, she always pitied animals very sincerely; and Father Bru, that poor old man, who was left to die because he could no longer hold a tool, was like a dog to her, an animal out of order, whose knackers did not even want to buy the skin or the the fat. It weighed on her heart knowing he was always there, on the other side of the corridor, abandoned by God and men, feeding only on himself, returning to the size of a child, shriveled and withered. like oranges that shrivel up on chimneys.","In addition to her own sorrows and privations, Gervaise, whose heart was not yet altogether hard, was condemned to hear now of the sufferings of others. The corner of the house in which she lived seemed to be consecrated to those who were as poor as herself. No smell of cooking filled the air, which, on the contrary, was laden with the shrill cries of hungry children, heavy with the sighs of weary, heartbroken mothers and with the oaths of drunken husbands and fathers. Gervaise pitied Father Bru from the bottom of her heart; he lay the greater part of the time rolled up in the straw in his den under the staircase leading to the roof. When two or three days elapsed without his showing himself someone opened the door and looked in to see if he were still alive. Yes, he was living; that is, he was not dead. When Gervaise had bread she always remembered him. If she had learned to hate men because of her husband her heart was still tender toward animals, and Father Bru seemed like one to her. She regarded him as a faithful old dog. Her heart was heavy within her whenever she thought of him, alone, abandoned by God and man, dying by inches or drying, rather, as an orange dries on the chimney piece.","In the midst of her own poverty Gervaise suffered even more because other families around her were also starving to death. Their corner of the tenement housed the most wretched. There was not a family that ate every day. Gervaise felt the most pity for Pere Bru in his cubbyhole under the staircase where he hibernated. Sometimes he stayed on his bed of straw without moving for days. Even hunger no longer drove him out since there was no use taking a walk when no one would invite him to dinner. Whenever he didn’t show his face for several days, the neighbors would push open his door to see if his troubles were over. No, he was still alive, just barely. Even Death seemed to have neglected him. Whenever Gervaise had any bread she gave him the crusts. Even when she hated all men because of her husband, she still felt sincerely sorry for Pere Bru, the poor old man. They were letting him starve to death because he could no longer hold tools in his hand."
"Alors, sans s'arrêter, les yeux emplis de l'or des cadres, ils suivirent l'enfilade des petits salons, regardant passer les images, trop nombreuses pour être bien vues. Il aurait fallu une heure devant chacune, si l'on avait voulu comprendre. Que de tableaux, sacredié ! ça ne finissait pas. Il devait y en avoir pour de l'argent. Puis, au bout, M. Madinier les arrêta brusquement devant le Radeau de la Méduse ; et il leur expliqua le sujet. Tous, saisis, immobiles, ne disaient rien. Quand on se remit à marcher, Boche résuma le sentiment général : c'était tapé.","Then, without stopping, their eyes filled with the gold of the frames, they followed the row of small salons, watching the images pass by, too numerous to be seen clearly. It would have taken an hour in front of each one, if one had wanted to understand. What paintings, sacredness! it didn't end. There had to be money for it. Then, at the end, M. Madinier stopped them abruptly in front of the Raft of the Medusa; and he explained the matter to them. All of them, seized, motionless, said nothing. When we started walking again, Boche summed up the general feeling: it was a hit.","The severe nudity of the great staircase cast a gloom over their spirits; an usher in livery added to their awe, and it was with great respect and on the tips of their toes they entered the French gallery. How many statues! How many pictures! They wished they had all the money they had cost. In the Gallerie d'Apollon the floor excited their admiration; it was smooth as glass; even the feet of the sofas were reflected in it.","Then, without stopping, their eyes occupied with the gilding of the frames, they followed the string of little rooms, glancing at the passing pictures too numerous to be seen properly. It would have required an hour before each, if they had wanted to understand it. What a number of pictures! There was no end to them. They must be worth a mint of money. Right at the end, Monsieur Madinier suddenly ordered a halt opposite the “Raft of the Medusa” and he explained the subject to them. All deeply impressed and motionless, they uttered not a word. When they started off again, Boche expressed the general feeling, saying it was marvellous."
"Les Goujet gagnaient encore à être fréquentés. Ils faisaient de grosses journées et plaçaient plus du quart de leur quinzaine à la Caisse d'épargne. Dans le quartier, on les saluait, on parlait de leurs économies. Goujet n'avait jamais un trou, sortait avec des bourgerons propres, sans une tache. Il était très poli, même un peu timide, malgré ses larges épaules. Les blanchisseuses du bout de la rue s'égayaient à le voir baisser le nez, quand il passait. Il n'aimait pas leurs gros mots, trouvait ça dégoûtant que des femmes eussent sans cesse des saletés à la bouche. Un jour pourtant, il était rentré gris. Alors, madame Goujet, pour tout reproche, l'avait mis en face d'un portrait de son père, une mauvaise peinture cachée pieusement au fond de la commode. Et, depuis cette leçon, Goujet ne buvait plus qu'à sa suffisance, sans haine pourtant contre le vin, car le vin est nécessaire à l'ouvrier. Le dimanche, il sortait avec sa mère, à laquelle il donnait le bras ; le plus souvent, il la menait du côté de Vincennes ; d'autres fois, il la conduisait au théâtre. Sa mère restait sa passion. Il lui parlait encore comme s'il était tout petit. La tête carrée, la chair alourdie par le rude travail du marteau, il tenait des grosses bêtes - dur d'intelligence, bon tout de même.","The Goujets still gained by being frequented. They worked long days and invested more than a quarter of their fortnight in the Caisse d'Epargne. In the neighborhood, we greeted them, we talked about their savings. Goujet never had a hole, came out with clean buds, without a stain. He was very polite, even a bit shy, despite his broad shoulders. The laundresses at the end of the street were amused to see him lower his nose when he passed. He didn't like their swear words, found it disgusting that women kept having dirt in their mouths all the time. One day, however, he came home drunk. Then, Madame Goujet, to reproach her, had put him in front of a portrait of her father, a bad painting hidden piously at the back of the chest of drawers. And, since that lesson, Goujet only drank to his sufficiency, without, however, hatred against wine, for wine is necessary for the workman. On Sundays he went out with his mother, to whom he gave his arm; more often than not he led her in the direction of Vincennes; other times he took her to the theatre. His mother remained his passion. He was still talking to her as if he were very small. The square head, the flesh weighed down by the hard work of the hammer, he held large beasts - hard of intelligence, good all the same.","The more she saw of her new friends the better Gervaise liked them. They were frugal but not parsimonious. They were the admiration of the neighborhood. Goujet was never seen with a hole or a spot on his garments. He was very polite to all but a little diffident, in spite of his height and broad shoulders. The girls in the street were much amused to see him look away when they met him; he did not fancy their ways—their forward boldness and loud laughs. One day he came home tipsy. His mother uttered no word of reproach but brought out a picture of his father which was piously preserved in her wardrobe. And after that lesson Goujet drank no more liquor, though he conceived no hatred for wine. On Sunday he went out with his mother, who was his idol. He went to her with all his troubles and with all his joys, as he had done when little. At first he took no interest in Gervaise, but after a while he began to like her and treated her like a sister, with abrupt familiarity.","The Goujets were worth visiting. They worked long hours, and placed more than a quarter of their fortnight’s earnings in the savings-bank. In the neighborhood everyone nodded to them, everyone talked of their savings. Goujet never had a hole in his clothes, always went out in a clean short blue blouse, without a stain. He was very polite, and even a trifle timid, in spite of his broad shoulders. The washerwomen at the end of the street laughed to see him hold down his head when he passed them. He did not like their oaths, and thought it disgusting that women should be constantly uttering foul words. One day, however, he came home tipsy. Then Madame Goujet, for sole reproach, held his father’s portrait before him, a daub of a painting hidden away at the bottom of a drawer; and, ever since that lesson, Goujet never drank more than was good for him, without however, any hatred of wine, for wine is necessary to the workman. On Sundays he walked out with his mother, who took hold of his arm. He would generally conduct her to Vincennes; at other times they would go to the theatre. His mother remained his passion. He still spoke to her as though he were a little child. Square-headed, his skin toughened by the wielding of the heavy hammer, he somewhat resembled the larger animals: dull of intellect, though good-natured all the same."
- Et la fluxion ? demanda la blanchisseuse.,- And the fluxion? asked the laundress.,she exclaimed.,“And the pneumonia?” inquired the laundress.
"- Nous sommes treize ! dit-elle, très émue, voyant là une nouvelle preuve du malheur dont elle se sentait menacée depuis quelque temps.","- We are thirteen! she said, very moved, seeing there a new proof of the misfortune with which she had felt threatened for some time.","""We are thirteen,"" she said, much disturbed, as she fancied this to be an additional proof of the misfortune which for some time she had felt to be hanging over them.","“We are thirteen!” said she, deeply affected, seeing in that a fresh omen of the misfortune with which she had felt herself threatened for some time past."
"- Ah bien ! dit madame Lorilleux devant les Boche, comme on partait, c'est notre filleule, mais du moment où ils en font une fleuriste, nous ne voulons plus entendre parler d'elle. Encore une roulure pour les boulevards ? Elle leur chiera du poivre, avant six mois.","- Ah well ! said Madame Lorilleux to the Boches, as we were leaving, she's our goddaughter, but the moment they make her a florist, we don't want to hear any more about her. Another roll for the boulevards? She'll shit them pepper, before six months.","Mme Lorilleux said to Mme Boche on their way home: ""Nana is our goddaughter now, but if she goes into that flower business, in six months she will be on the pavé, and we will have nothing to do with her.""","“Ah well,” said Madame Lorilleux to the Boches, as they were all leaving, “she’s our goddaughter, but as they’re going to put her into artificial flower-making, we don’t wish to have anything more to do with her. Just one more for the boulevards. She’ll be leading them a merry chase before six months are over.”"
"- Oui, on peut à la fin avoir le désir de mourir dans son lit ? Moi, après avoir bien trimé toute ma vie, je mourrais volontiers dans mon lit, chez moi.","- Yes, one can in the end have the desire to die in one's bed? Me, after having worked hard all my life, I would gladly die in my bed, at home.","""Yes, and at the end I should wish to die in my bed in my own home!""","Then, after a moment she went on, “Yes, when one reaches the end, one might wish to die in one’s bed. For myself, having trudged through life, I should like to die in my bed, in my own home.”"
"- Dites donc ! faites un peu attention, vous allez encore emporter des brins d'or à vos semelles ? Vrai, on dirait que vous avez là-dessous de la graisse, pour que ça colle.","- So say ! be a little careful, you're still going to take strands of gold off your soles? True, looks like you got some grease under there to stick it.","""Take care!"" he said roughly. ""You will carry off some of the particles of gold on the soles of your shoes. It looks really as if you had greased them!""","And as she approached nearer, with her feet on the board, the chainmaker roughly called out, without giving any further answer to her question: “Look out, pest—take care; you’ll be carrying some scraps of gold away on the soles of your shoes. One would think you had greased them on purpose to make the gold stick to them.”"
"Ses regards inquiets fouillaient les coins, cherchaient, parmi toute cette crasse, le resplendissement qu'elle avait rêvé.","Her worried gaze searched the corners, searching among all this filth for the brilliance she had dreamed of.","Her eager eyes searched the corners, hoping to discover amid all the dirt something of the splendor of which she had dreamed.",Her anxious glances searched the corners and sought amongst all that filth for the resplendence she had dreamt of.
"- Mon Dieu ! dit-il, on pourrait aller au musée ?","- My God ! he said, could we go to the museum?","M. Madinier had proposed nothing; he stood leaning against the counter with a pompous air; he spat upon the ground, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and rolled his eyes about. ""We could go to the Musée du Louvre, I suppose,"" and he smoothed his chin while awaiting the effect of this proposition.","“Mon Dieu!” said he, “we might go to the Museum.”"
"- Qu'est-ce qu'il fait là, ce vieux ? Il y a un quart d'heure qu'il espionne ici.","- What is he doing there, this old man? He's been spying here for a quarter of an hour.","""Who is that old fellow?"" she said. ""He has been there a full quarter of an hour.""","At the same moment Leonie, who was watching a man stationed at the foot of the pavement over the way, exclaimed, “What’s that old fellow about? He’s been spying here for the last quarter of an hour.”"
"- Moi, je ne m'y connais pas, monsieur, répondit la blanchisseuse d'un air de réserve.","""I don't know anything about it, sir,"" replied the laundress with an air of reserve.","he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","“I’m no judge, sir,” replied the laundress, reservedly."
"- N'ayez pas peur, il n'est pas méchant, continuait Lorilleux. C'est un voisin ; la troisième chambre dans le corridor, avant d'arriver chez nous ? Il serait propre, si son administration le voyait comme ça !","""Don't be afraid, he's not bad,"" continued Lorilleux. He is a neighbor; the third bedroom in the corridor, before arriving at our house? He would be clean, if his administration saw him like that!","""You need not be afraid,"" continued Lorilleux; ""he will do you no harm. He is a neighbor of ours—the third room on the left in our corridor."" But Father Bazonge was talking to Gervaise.","“Don’t be afraid, he’s harmless,” continued Lorilleux. “He’s a neighbor of ours—the third room in the passage before us. He would find himself in a nice mess if his people were to see him like this!”"
"La bonne manière du patron rétablit la gaieté, un moment compromise. Gervaise, tranquillisée, était redevenue toute souriante. Les convives achevaient le potage. Puis les litres circulèrent, et l'on but le premier verre de vin, quatre doigts de vin pur, pour faire couler les pâtes. Dans la pièce voisine, on entendait les enfants se disputer. Il y avait là Etienne, Nana, Pauline et le petit Victor Fauconnier. On s'était décidé à leur installer une table pour eux quatre, en leur recommandant d'être bien sages. Ce louchon d'Augustine, qui surveillait les fourneaux, devait manger sur ses genoux.","The good manners of the owner restores the cheerfulness, a moment compromised. Gervaise, reassured, had again become quite smiling. The guests were finishing the soup. Then the liters circulated, and we drank the first glass of wine, four fingers of pure wine, to make the pasta flow. In the next room, we could hear the children arguing. There were Etienne, Nana, Pauline and little Victor Fauconnier. We had decided to set up a table for the four of them, advising them to be very good. That sleazy Augustine, who watched the stoves, had to eat on her knees.","This little act on the part of the host brought back the smiles to the faces around the table. The wine began to circulate, and the voices of the children were heard in the next room. Etienne, Nana, Pauline and little Victor Fauconnier were installed at a small table and were told to be very good.","The good behavior of the master of the house restored the gaiety of the proceedings, which at one moment had been compromised. Gervaise, once more at her ease, was all smiles again. The guests finished their soup. Then the bottles circulated and they drank their first glass of wine, just a drop pure, to wash down the vermicelli. One could hear the children quarrelling in the next room. There were Etienne, Pauline, Nana and little Victor Fauconnier. It had been decided to lay a table for the four of them, and they had been told to be very good. That squint-eyed Augustine who had to look after the stoves was to eat off her knees."
"Un samedi, Nana trouva en rentrant son père et sa mère dans un état abominable. Coupeau, tombé en travers du lit, ronflait. Gervaise, tassée sur une chaise, roulait la tête avec des yeux vagues et inquiétants ouverts sur le vide. Elle avait oublié de faire chauffer le dîner, un restant de ragoût. Une chandelle, qu'elle ne mouchait pas, éclairait la misère honteuse du taudis.","One Saturday, Nana came home to find her father and mother in an abominable state. Coupeau, having fallen across the bed, was snoring. Gervaise, huddled on a chair, rolled her head with vague and worrying eyes open to emptiness. She had forgotten to heat up dinner, leftover stew. A candle, which she did not blow out, lighted up the shameful misery of the hovel.","One Saturday Nana, coming in, found her mother and father in a deplorable condition—Coupeau lying across the bed and Gervaise sitting in a chair, swaying to and fro. She had forgotten the dinner, and one untrimmed candle lighted the dismal scene.","One Saturday when Nana came home she found her father and her mother in a lamentable condition. Coupeau, who had fallen across the bed was snoring. Gervaise, crouching on a chair was swaying her head, with her eyes vaguely and threateningly staring into vacancy. She had forgotten to warm the dinner, the remains of a stew. A tallow dip which she neglected to snuff revealed the shameful misery of their hovel."
"Il s'était soulevé, il la regardait. De grosses larmes aussitôt remontèrent à ses yeux.","He had risen, he was looking at her. Big tears immediately came to her eyes.","Goujet, crushed by what he had heard from Mamma Coupeau, lay at full length on the bed with pale face and haggard eyes.",He had raised himself up and was looking at her. Big tears at once filled his eyes.
"- C'est donc sérieux, murmura-t-il. Ce sacré Cadet-Cassis, on ne sait jamais s'il veut rire.","""So it's serious,"" he murmured. This sacred Cadet-Cassis, you never know if he wants to laugh.","""Are you in earnest?"" he murmured, and then continued as if soliloquizing, ""It is hard to know when this confounded Cadet-Cassis is in earnest.""","“So it’s serious then?” murmured he. “That confounded Young Cassis, one never knows whether he is joking or not.”"
"Dans le quartier, les soûlardes de son espèce racontaient maintenant qu'elle buvait pour se consoler de la culbute de sa fille. Elle-même, quand elle sifflait son verre de rogome sur le comptoir, prenait des airs de drame, se jetait ça dans le plomb en souhaitant que ça la fît crever. Et, les jours où elle rentrait ronde comme une bourrique, elle bégayait que c'était le chagrin. Mais les gens honnêtes haussaient les épaules ; on la connaît celle-là, de mettre les culottes de poivre d'Assommoir sur le compte du chagrin ; en tout cas, ça devait s'appeler du chagrin en bouteille. Sans doute, au commencement, elle n'avait pas digéré la fugue de Nana. Ce qui restait en elle d'honnêteté se révoltait ; puis, généralement, une mère n'aime pas se dire que sa demoiselle, juste à la minute, se fait peut-être tutoyer par le premier venu. Mais elle était déjà trop abêtie, la tête malade et le cœur écrasé, pour garder longtemps cette honte. Chez elle, ça entrait et ça sortait. Elle restait très bien des huit jours sans songer à sa gourgandine ; et, brusquement, une tendresse ou une colère l'empoignait, des fois à jeun, des fois le sac plein, un besoin furieux de pincer Nana dans un petit endroit, où elle l'aurait peut-être embrassée, peut-être rouée de coups, selon son envie du moment. Elle finissait par n'avoir plus une idée bien nette de l'honnêteté. Seulement, Nana était à elle, n'est-ce pas ? Eh bien ! lorsqu'on a une propriété, on ne veut pas la voir s'évaporer.","In the neighborhood, drunkards of her kind now said that she drank to console herself for her daughter's tumble. She herself, when she sniffed her glass of rogome on the counter, put on airs of drama, threw it into the lead, hoping it would make her die. And, on the days when she came home plump as a donkey, she stammered that it was grief. But honest people shrug their shoulders; we know that one, of attributing the pepper breeches of Assommoir to grief; anyway, it had to be called grief in a bottle. No doubt, at the beginning, she hadn't digested Nana's running away. What honesty remained in her revolted; then, generally, a mother does not like to think that her young lady, just at the minute, is perhaps being called on by the first comer. But she was already too stupid, her head sick and her heart crushed, to keep this shame for long. In her house, it went in and it went out. She spent a week very well without thinking of her gourgandine; and, suddenly, tenderness or anger gripped her, sometimes on an empty stomach, sometimes with a full bag, a furious need to pinch Nana in a small place, where she might have kissed her, blows, according to his desire of the moment. She ended up having no clear idea of honesty. Only, Nana was hers, wasn't she? Well ! when you have a property, you don't want to see it evaporate.","In the Quartier all the women who drank like her took her part and declared she had been driven to intemperance by her daughter's misconduct. She, too, began to believe this herself and assumed at times a tragic air and wished she were dead. Unquestionably she had suffered from Nana's departure. A mother does not like to feel that her daughter will leave her for the first person who asks her to do so. But she was too thoroughly demoralized to care long, and soon she had but one idea: that Nana belonged to her. Had she not a right to her own property?","In the neighborhood the feminine tipplers of her own class now related that she drank to console herself for her daughter ’s misconduct. She herself, when she gulped down her dram of spirits on the counter, assumed a dramatic air, and tossed the liquor into her mouth, wishing it would “do” for her. And on the days when she came home boozed she stammered that it was all through grief. But honest folks shrugged their shoulders. They knew what that meant: ascribing the effects of the peppery fire of l’Assommoir to grief, indeed! At all events, she ought to have called it bottled grief. No doubt at the beginning she couldn’t digest Nana’s flight. All the honest feelings remaining in her revolted at the thought, and besides, as a rule a mother doesn’t like to have to think that her daughter, at that very moment, perhaps, is being familiarly addressed by the first chance comer. But Gervaise was already too stultified with a sick head and a crushed heart, to think of the shame for long. With her it came and went. She remained sometimes for a week together without thinking of her daughter, and then suddenly a tender or an angry feeling seized hold of her, sometimes when she had her stomach empty, at others when it was full, a furious longing to catch Nana in some corner, where she would perhaps have kissed her or perhaps have beaten her, according to the fancy of the moment."
"Elle était blanche. Coupeau continuait son cavalier seul, de la fenêtre au matelas, et du matelas à la fenêtre, suant, s'échinant, battant la même mesure. Alors, elle se sauva. Mais elle eut beau dégringoler l'escalier, elle entendit jusqu'en bas le sacré chahut de son homme. Ah ! mon Dieu ! qu'il faisait bon dehors, on respirait !","She was white. Coupeau continued on his own, from the window to the mattress, and from the mattress to the window, sweating, toiling, beating the same time. So she ran away. But no matter how much she tumbled down the stairs, she heard her man's damned uproar all the way down. Ah! my God ! it was good outside, we breathed!","She was very pale. Coupeau kept up his infernal dance while she tottered down the stairs, followed by his hoarse voice. How good it was to breathe the fresh air outside!","She was quite white. Coupeau was continuing his breakdown from the window to the mattress and from the mattress to the window, perspiring, toiling, always beating the same rhythm. Then she hurried away. But though she scrambled down the stairs, she still heard her husband’s confounded jig until she reached the bottom. Ah! Mon Dieu! how pleasant it was out of doors, one could breathe there!"
"Elle avait trié le linge, mis à part les quelques pièces de couleur. Puis, après avoir empli son baquet de quatre seaux d'eau froide, pris au robinet, derrière elle, elle plongea le tas du linge blanc ; et, relevant sa jupe, la tirant entre ses cuisses, elle entra dans une boîte posée debout, qui lui arrivait au ventre.","She had sorted the laundry, apart from the few colored pieces. Then, after having filled her tub with four buckets of cold water, taken from the tap, behind her, she plunged the heap of white linen; and, raising her skirt, pulling it between her thighs, she entered a box placed upright, which came up to her stomach.","she said. ""I know all about it!""","She had sorted her laundry with several colored pieces to one side. Then, after filling her tub with four pails of cold water from the tap behind her, she plunged her pile of whites into it."
"- Je vous dis que c'est de bon cœur ! criait-il. Vous boirez un verre de vin ? Les hommes sont des hommes, n'est-ce pas ? On est fait pour se comprendre ?","- I tell you that it is with a good heart! he shouted. Will you drink a glass of wine? Men are men, aren't they? Are we made to understand each other?","""I tell you, you must!"" he cried. ""You shall drink a glass of wine with us. Men will be men all the world over. My wife and I know that perfectly well.""","“I tell you, you’re quite welcome!” shouted he. “You’ll take a glass of wine. Men are men, you know. We ought to understand each other.”"
"- Ah ! les cheulards ! dit-il, dès qu'il les aperçut cachés sous une porte. J'ai senti ça ? Hein ? qu'est-ce qu'on mange ?","- Oh! the cheaters! he said, as soon as he saw them hidden under a door. I felt that? Eh ? what are we eating ?","""Aha!"" he said as he saw his friend. ""I knew it!"" They went to a restaurant and ordered a famous repast of pigs' feet, and they sat and sucked the bones and talked about their various employers.","“Ah! you jokers!” said he, as soon as he caught sight of them hiding in a doorway. “I guessed it. Well, what are we going to eat?”"
"Nana gonfla les joues, comme si elle retenait un grand rire. Ah bien ! son père ! il en disait d'autres ! Mais Léonie, tout d'un coup, souffla très bas et très vite :","Nana puffed out her cheeks, as if holding back a big laugh. Ah well ! his father ! he said others! But Léonie, all of a sudden, blew very low and very quickly:","""Did you know,"" said Leonie as she picked up a rose leaf with her pincers, ""how wretched poor Caroline is with that fellow who used to call for her regularly every night?"" Before anyone could answer Leonie added:",Madame Lerat had to display severity over the muffled laughter. Then Leonie whispered suddenly:
"- Ah bien ! criait madame Lorilleux dans toute la rue de la Goutte-d'Or, mon imbécile de frère en voit de drôles ! ? Il ne manquait plus à la Banban que de faire la vie. Ça lui va bien, n'est-ce pas ?","- Ah well ! shouted Madame Lorilleux in the whole rue de la Goutte-d'Or, my stupid brother sees funny things! ? The Banban only needed to make life. It suits him well, doesn't it?","The Lorilleuxs were in a state of rage, and one morning when the apprentice was emptying, on the sly, a bowl of starch which she had burned in making, just as Mme Lorilleux was passing, she rushed in and accused her sister-in-law of insulting her.","said Madame Lorilleux all over the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or, “my fool of a brother is seeing some funny things! All that was wanting was that Clump-clump should go about so haughty. It becomes her well, doesn’t it?”"
"Sa voix montait, rauque, épouvantée, et il se baissait vivement, répétant que la rousse et les pantalons rouges étaient en bas, des hommes qui le visaient avec des fusils. Dans le mur, il voyait le canon d'un pistolet braqué sur sa poitrine. On venait lui reprendre la fille.","His voice rose, hoarse, appalled, and he ducked sharply, repeating that the redhead and the red pants were downstairs, men aiming guns at him. In the wall, he saw the barrel of a gun pointed at his chest. They had come to take the girl back from him.","Good God, man, don't fire!""","His voice rose, hoarse and terrified and he stooped down quickly, saying that the police and the military were below, men who were aiming at him with rifles. In the wall he saw the barrel of a pistol emerging, pointed at his breast. They had dragged the girl away."
"Puis, après avoir songé une minute, il reprit :","Then, after thinking for a minute, he resumed:",But after a moment's silence he added:,"Then, after thinking a minute, he resumed:"
"Il s'arrêta, un peu étouffé.","He stopped, a little choked.","My mother says things are all going wrong with you, and,"" he hesitated, ""we must go away together and at once.""",My mother tells me things are getting worse for you.
"- Oui, c'est moi. Après ? répondit-il. Tu ne vas pas commencer tes bêtises, peut-être !","- Yes it's me. After ? he replied. You're not going to start your nonsense, maybe!","""Yes, I have come,"" he answered, ""and what of it? Don't begin any of your nonsense now!""","“Yes, it’s me. What of it?” he replied. “You are not going to begin any of your nonsense, I hope!”"
"- Oh ! maman, j'ai bobo ? oh ! maman, j'ai bobo ?","- Oh ! mom, am I sore? Oh ! mom, am I sore?",Gervaise started as her eyes fell on her boy.,"“Oh! Mamma, I’m not well; oh! mamma, I’m not well.”"
"Et elle se tut, tremblante, écoutant un pas lourd qui montait l'escalier. Brutalement, le père Bijard poussa la porte. Il avait son coup de bouteille comme à l'ordinaire, les yeux flambant de la folie furieuse du vitriol. Quand il aperçut Lalie couchée, il tapa sur ses cuisses avec un ricanement, il décrocha le grand fouet, en grognant :","And she fell silent, trembling, listening to a heavy step coming up the stairs. Abruptly Father Bijard pushed open the door. He had his bottle shot as usual, his eyes blazing with the furious madness of vitriol. When he saw Lalie lying down, he slapped her thighs with a sneer, he took down the big whip, growling:","She started at the sound of a heavy step on the stairs. Her father noisily pushed open the door. As usual he had drunk too much, and in his eyes blazed the lurid flames kindled by alcohol. When he saw Lalie lying down he walked to the corner and took up the long whip, from which he slowly unwound the lash.","And then she relapsed into silence, trembling and listening to a heavy footfall which was approaching up the stairs. Suddenly father Bijard brutally opened the door. As usual he was far gone, and his eyes shone with the furious madness imparted by the vitriol he had swallowed. When he perceived Lalie in bed, he tapped on his thighs with a sneer, and took the whip from where it hung."

"C'était une boutique très propre, juste dans la grande maison où ils rêvaient d'habiter autrefois. Il y avait la boutique, une arrière-boutique, avec deux autres chambres, à droite et à gauche ; enfin, ce qu'il leur fallait, les pièces un peu petites, mais bien distribuées. Seulement, elle trouvait ça trop cher : le propriétaire parlait de cinq cents francs.","It was a very clean shop, right in the big house where they once dreamed of living. There was the shop, a back room, with two other rooms, to the right and to the left; finally, what they needed, the rooms a little small, but well distributed. Only, she thought it was too expensive: the owner was talking about five hundred francs.","It was a very nice shop in the very house of which they had so often thought. There was the shop itself—a back room—and two others. They were small, to be sure, but convenient and well arranged; only she thought it dear—five hundred francs.","It was a very decent shop, and in that big house where they dreamed of living in former days. There was the shop, a back room, and two other rooms to the right and left; in short, just what they required. The rooms were rather small, but well placed. Only, she considered they wanted too much; the landlord talked of five hundred francs."
"- Bien sûr, je ne dirai pas oui comme ça, reprit Gervaise. Je ne tiens pas à ce que, plus tard, vous m'accusiez de vous avoir poussé à faire une bêtise ? Voyez-vous, monsieur Coupeau, vous avez tort de vous entêter. Vous ignorez vous-même ce que vous éprouvez pour moi. Si vous ne me rencontriez pas de huit jours, ça vous passerait, je parie. Les hommes, souvent, se marient pour une nuit, la première, et puis les nuits se suivent, les jours s'allongent, toute la vie, et ils sont joliment embêtés ? Asseyez-vous là, je veux bien causer tout de suite. Alors, jusqu'à une heure du matin, dans la chambre noire, à la clarté fumeuse d'une chandelle qu'ils oubliaient de moucher, ils discutèrent leur mariage, baissant la voix, afin de ne pas réveiller les deux enfants, Claude et Etienne, qui dormaient avec leur petit souffle, la tête sur le même oreiller. Et Gervaise revenait toujours à eux, les montrait à Coupeau ; c'était là une drôle de dot qu'elle lui apportait, elle ne pouvait pas vraiment l'encombrer de deux mioches. Puis, elle était prise de honte pour lui. Qu'est-ce qu'on dirait dans le quartier ? On l'avait connue avec son amant, on savait son histoire ; ce ne serait guère propre, quand on les verrait s'épouser, au bout de deux mois à peine. A toutes ces bonnes raisons, Coupeau répondait par des haussements d'épaules. Il se moquait bien du quartier ! Il ne mettait pas son nez dans les affaires des autres ; il aurait eu trop peur de le salir, d'abord ! Eh bien ! oui, elle avait eu Lantier avant lui. Où était le mal ? Elle ne faisait pas la vie, elle n'amènerait pas des hommes dans son ménage, comme tant de femmes, et des plus riches. Quant aux enfants, ils grandiraient, on les élèverait, parbleu ! Jamais il ne trouverait une femme aussi courageuse, aussi bonne, remplie de plus de qualités. D'ailleurs, ce n'était pas tout ça, elle aurait pu rouler sur les trottoirs, être laide, fainéante, dégoûtante, avoir une séquelle d'enfants crottés, ça n'aurait pas compté à ses yeux : il la voulait.","""Of course, I won't say yes like that,"" Gervaise went on. I don't want you later to accuse me of pushing you to do something stupid? You see, Mr. Coupeau, you are wrong to be stubborn. You don't even know what you feel for me. If you didn't meet me for eight days, you'd be fine, I bet. Men often get married for one night, the first, and then the nights go by, the days get longer, all their lives, and they are pretty annoyed? Sit down there, I'm willing to talk right away. So, until one o'clock in the morning, in the dark room, in the smoky light of a candle they forgot to blow their nose, they discussed their marriage, lowering their voices so as not to wake the two children, Claude and Etienne, who slept with their little breath, their heads on the same pillow. And Gervaise always came back to them, showed them to Coupeau; that was a strange dowry she was bringing him, she couldn't really encumber him with two kids. Then she felt ashamed for him. What's it like in the neighborhood? We had known her with her lover, we knew her story; it would hardly be proper, when we saw them marrying, after barely two months. To all these good reasons, Coupeau responded by shrugging his shoulders. He didn't care about the neighborhood! He didn't stick his nose into other people's business; he would have been too afraid to dirty it, first! Well ! yes, she had had Lantier before him. Where was the harm? She didn't make life, she wouldn't bring men into her household, like so many women, and the richest. As for the children, they would grow up, we would raise them, damn it! He would never find a woman so brave, so good, filled with more qualities. Besides, it wasn't all that, she could have rolled on the sidewalks, been ugly, lazy, disgusting, had the aftermath of muddy children, it wouldn't have counted in his eyes: he wanted her.","""I cannot say yes in such a hurry,"" remonstrated Gervaise. ""I do not choose to run the risk of your telling me at some future day that I led you into this. You are making a great mistake, I assure you. Suppose you should not see me for a week—you would forget me entirely. Men sometimes marry for a fancy and in twenty-four hours would gladly take it all back. Sit down here and let us talk a little."" They sat in that dingy room lit only by one candle, which they forgot to snuff, and discussed the expediency of their marriage until after midnight, speaking very low, lest they should disturb the children, who were asleep with weir heads on the same pillow. And Gervaise pointed them out to Coupeau. That was an odd sort of dowry to carry a man, surely! How could she venture to go to him with such encumbrances? Then, too, she was troubled about another thing. People would laugh at him. Her story was known; her lover had been seen, and there would be no end of talk if she should marry now. To all these good and excellent reasons Coupeau answered with a shrug of his shoulders. What did he care for talk and gossip? He never meddled with the affairs of others; why should they meddle with his? Yes, she had children, to be sure, and he would look out for them with her. He had never seen a woman in his life who was so good and so courageous and patient. Besides, that had nothing to do with it! Had she been ugly and lazy, with a dozen dirty children, he would have wanted her and only her.","“But I certainly can’t say ‘yes’ just like that,” resumed Gervaise. “I don’t want you to be able to accuse me later on of having incited you to do a foolish thing. You shouldn’t be so insistent, Monsieur Coupeau. You can’t really be sure that you’re in love with me. If you didn’t see me for a week, it might fade away. Sometimes men get married and then there’s day after day, stretching out into an entire lifetime, and they get pretty well bored by it all. Sit down there; I’m willing to talk it over at once.” Then until one in the morning, in the dark room and by the faint light of a smoky tallow candle which they forgot to snuff, they talked of their marriage, lowering their voices so as not to wake the two children, Claude and Etienne, who were sleeping, both heads on the same pillow. Gervaise kept pointing out the children to Coupeau, what a funny kind of dowry they were. She really shouldn’t burden him with them. Besides, what would the neighbors say? She’d feel ashamed for him because everyone knew about the story of her life and her lover. They wouldn’t think it decent if they saw them getting married barely two months later. Coupeau replied by shrugging his shoulders. He didn’t care about the neighbors! He never bothered about their affairs. So, there was Lantier before him, well, so what? What’s so bad about that? She hadn’t been constantly bringing men upstairs, as some women did, even rich ladies! The children would grow up, they’d raise them right. Never had he known before such a woman, such sound character, so good-hearted. Anyway, she could have been anything, a streetwalker, ugly, lazy and good-for-nothing, with a whole gang of dirty kids, and so what? He wanted her."
"- Ah bien ! dit Gervaise, si nous ne fondons pas, aujourd'hui ! On retirerait sa chemise !","- Ah well ! said Gervaise, if we don't melt today! We would take off his shirt!","""What a melting day!"" said Gervaise, who was stooping over a great bowl of starch.","“Ah, well!” said Gervaise, “it’s enough to melt one! We might have to take off our chemises.”"
"Le choix d'un logement, depuis deux mois, les occupait. Ils voulurent, avant tout, en louer un dans la grande maison, rue de la Goutte-d'Or. Mais pas une chambre n'y était libre, ils durent renoncer à leur ancien rêve. Pour dire la vérité, Gervaise ne fut pas fâchée, au fond : le voisinage des Lorilleux, porte à porte, l'effrayait beaucoup. Alors, ils cherchèrent ailleurs. Coupeau, très justement, tenait à ne pas s'éloigner de l'atelier de madame Fauconnier, pour que Gervaise pût, d'un saut, être chez elle à toutes les heures du jour. Et ils eurent enfin une trouvaille, une grande chambre, avec un cabinet et une cuisine, rue Neuve de la Goutte-d'Or, presque en face de la blanchisseuse. C'était une petite maison à un seul étage, un escalier très raide, en haut duquel il y avait seulement deux logements, l'un à droite, l'autre à gauche ; le bas se trouvait habité par un loueur de voitures, dont le matériel occupait des hangars dans une vaste cour, le long de la rue. La jeune femme, charmée, croyait retourner en province ; pas de voisines, pas de cancans à craindre, un coin de tranquillité qui lui rappelait une ruelle de Plassans, derrière les remparts ; et, pour comble de chance, elle pouvait voir sa fenêtre, de son établi, sans quitter ses fers, en allongeant la tête.","The choice of a lodging had occupied them for two months. Above all, they wanted to hire one in the big house in the rue de la Goutte-d'Or. But not a room was free there, they had to give up their old dream. To tell the truth, Gervaise was not really angry: the proximity of the Lorilleux, door to door, frightened her very much. So they looked elsewhere. Coupeau very justly insisted on staying close to Madame Fauconnier's studio, so that Gervaise could be at home at all times of the day. And they finally had a find, a large bedroom, with a study and a kitchen, in the Rue Neuve de la Goutte-d'Or, almost opposite the laundress. It was a small one-storey house, a very steep staircase, at the top of which there were only two lodgings, one on the right, the other on the left; the bottom was inhabited by a car rental company, whose equipment occupied sheds in a large courtyard, along the street. The young woman, charmed, thought she was returning to the provinces; no neighbours, no gossip to be feared, a corner of tranquility which reminded him of an alley in Plassans, behind the ramparts; and, to make matters worse, she could see her window from her workbench, without taking off her irons, by stretching out her head.","For two months they had been looking for an apartment. They wished, of all things, to take one in the old house where Mme Lorilleux lived, but there was not one single room to be rented, and they were compelled to relinquish the idea. Gervaise was reconciled to this more easily, since she did not care to be thrown in any closer contact with the Lorilleuxs. They looked further. It was essential that Gervaise should be near her friend and employer Mme Fauconnier, and they finally succeeded in their search and were indeed in wonderful luck, for they obtained a large room with a kitchen and tiny bedroom just opposite the establishment of the laundress. It was a small house, two stories, with one steep staircase, and was divided into two lodgings—the one on the right, the other on the left, while the lower floor was occupied by a carriage maker.","For two months past they had been busy seeking some new apartments. At first they wanted above everything to hire these in the big house of the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or. But there was not a single room to let there; so that they had to relinquish their old dream. To tell the truth, Gervaise was rather glad in her heart; the neighborhood of the Lorilleux almost door to door, frightened her immensely. Then, they looked about elsewhere. Coupeau, very properly did not wish to be far from Madame Fauconnier’s so that Gervaise could easily run home at any hour of the day. And at length they met with exactly what suited them, a large room with a small closet and a kitchen, in the Rue Neuve de la Goutte-d’Or, almost opposite the laundress’s. This was in a small two-story building with a very steep staircase. There were two apartments on the second floor, one to the left, the other to the right, The ground floor was occupied by a man who rented out carriages, which filled the sheds in the large stable yard by the street. Gervaise was delighted with this as it made her feel she was back in a country town. With no close neighbors there would be no gossip to worry about in this little corner. It reminded her of a small lane outside the ramparts of Plassans. She could even see her own window while ironing at the laundry by just tilting her head to the side."
"Nana, en train de couper de minces bandes de papier vert, s'écria :","Nana, cutting thin strips of green paper, exclaimed:","""Did you know,"" said Leonie as she picked up a rose leaf with her pincers, ""how wretched poor Caroline is with that fellow who used to call for her regularly every night?""","“Ah!” said Nana, who was cutting thin strips of green paper."
"Le lendemain, restée seule, elle ne put résister au besoin d'enlever le globe de la pendule et de regarder le livret de la Caisse d'épargne. Dire que sa boutique était là-dedans, dans ces feuillets salis de vilaines écritures ! Avant d'aller au travail, elle consulta madame Goujet, qui approuva beaucoup son projet de s'établir ; avec un homme comme le sien, bon sujet, ne buvant pas, elle était certaine de faire ses affaires et de ne pas être mangée. Au déjeuner, elle monta même chez les Lorilleux pour avoir leur avis ; elle désirait ne pas paraître se cacher de la famille. Madame Lorilleux resta saisie. Comment ! la Banban allait avoir une boutique, à cette heure ! Et, le cœur crevé, elle balbutia, elle dut se montrer très contente : sans doute, la boutique était commode, Gervaise avait raison de la prendre. Pourtant, lorsqu'elle se fut un peu remise, elle et son mari parlèrent de l'humidité de la cour, du jour triste des pièces du rez-de-chaussée. Oh ! c'était un bon coin pour les rhumatismes. Enfin, si elle était décidée à louer, n'est-ce pas ? leurs observations, bien certainement, ne l'empêcheraient pas de louer.","The next day, left alone, she couldn't resist the urge to take the globe off the clock and look at the Caisse d'Epargne passbook. To think that his shop was in there, in those pages soiled with ugly handwriting! Before going to work, she consulted Madame Goujet, who greatly approved of her plan to establish herself; with a man like hers, a good subject, not drinking, she was certain of doing her business and not being eaten. At lunch she even went up to the Lorilleux's to get their opinion; she wished not to appear to be hiding from the family. Madame Lorilleux was taken aback. How ! La Banban was going to have a shop at this hour! And, heartbroken, she stammered, she must have been very pleased: no doubt the shop was convenient, Gervaise was right to take it. However, when she had recovered a little, she and her husband spoke of the dampness of the courtyard, of the dreary light in the rooms on the ground floor. Oh ! it was a good spot for rheumatism. Finally, if she was decided to rent, is not it? their observations would certainly not prevent him from praising.","The next day when she was alone she lifted the shade from the clock and opened her bankbook. Just to think that her shop and future prosperity lay between those dirty leaves! Before going to her work she consulted Mme Goujet, who approved of the plan. With a husband like hers, who never drank, she could not fail of success. At noon she called on her sister-in-law to ask her advice, for she did not wish to have the air of concealing anything from the family. Mme Lorilleux was confounded. What, did Wooden Legs think of having an establishment of her own? And with an envious heart she stammered out that it would be very well, certainly, but when she had recovered herself a little she began to talk of the dampness of the courtyard and of the darkness of the rez-de-chaussée. Oh yes, it was a capital place for rheumatism, but of course if her mind was made up anything she could say would make no difference.","On the morrow, when she was alone, she could not resist removing the glass cover from the clock, and taking a peep at the savings-bank book. To think that her shop was there, in those dirty pages, covered with ugly writing! Before going off to her work, she consulted Madame Goujet, who highly approved her project of setting up in business for herself; with a husband like hers, a good fellow who did not drink, she was certain of getting on, and of not having her earnings squandered. At the luncheon hour Gervaise even called on the Lorilleuxs to ask their advice; she did not wish to appear to be doing anything unknown to the family. Madame Lorilleux was struck all of a heap. What! Clump-clump was going in for a shop now! And her heart bursting with envy , she stammered, and tried to pretend to be pleased: no doubt the shop was a convenient one—Gervaise was right in taking it. However, when she had somewhat recovered, she and her husband talked of the dampness of the courtyard, of the poor light of the rooms on the ground floor. Oh! it was a good place for rheumatism. Yet, if she had made up her mind to take it, their observations, of course, would not make her alter her decision."
"- On voit bien que votre mari est tailleur, madame, dit la grande veuve, avec son pincement de lèvres plein de sous-entendu. C'est un juponnier numéro un ? Je lui ai pourtant allongé de fameux coups de pied, sous la table.","""It is clear that your husband is a tailor, Madame,"" said the great widow, with her pursed lips full of insinuation. He's a number one petticoat? However, I gave him famous kicks, under the table.","At the end of a half-hour he reappeared, having yielded to the extent of paying three francs, but no one was satisfied, and they all began a discussion in regard to the extras.","“One can easily see that your husband’s a tailor, madame,” said the tall widow, with a curl of the lip, full of a double meaning. “He’s a petticoat specialist, even though I gave him some pretty hard kicks under the table.”"
"Alors, les Lorilleux pincèrent les lèvres et échangèrent un mince regard. La Banban mendiait, à cette heure ! Eh bien ! le plongeon était complet. C'est eux qui n'aimaient pas ça ! S'ils avaient su, ils se seraient barricadés, parce qu'on doit toujours être sur l'œil avec les mendiants, des gens qui s'introduisent dans les appartements sous des prétextes, et qui filent en déménageant les objets précieux. D'autant plus que, chez eux, il y avait de quoi voler ; on pouvait envoyer les doigts partout, et en emporter des trente et des quarante francs, rien qu'en fermant le poing. Déjà plusieurs fois, ils s'étaient méfiés, en remarquant la drôle de figure de Gervaise, quand elle se plantait devant l'or. Cette fois, par exemple, ils allaient la surveiller. Et, comme elle s'approchait davantage, les pieds sur la claie de bois, le chaîniste lui cria rudement, sans répondre davantage à sa demande :","Then the Lorilleux pursed their lips and exchanged a slight look. La Banban was begging at this hour! Well ! the dive was complete. They were the ones who didn't like it! If they had known, they would have barricaded themselves, because you always have to be on the lookout for beggars, people who break into apartments under pretexts, and who slip away while moving precious objects. Especially since, at home, there was something to steal; one could send one's fingers everywhere, and take away thirty or forty francs, just by clenching one's fist. Several times already, they had been suspicious, noticing Gervaise's funny face when she stood in front of the gold. This time, for example, they were going to watch her. And, as she approached nearer, her feet on the wooden hurdle, the chain-maker shouted to her harshly, without responding further to her request:","The husband and wife exchanged a look. Wooden Legs begging at their door! Well! Well! Who would have thought it? Why had they not known it was she when they rashly called out, ""Come in? "" Really, they could not allow such people to cross their threshold; there was too much that was valuable in the room. They had several times distrusted Gervaise; she looked about so queerly, and now they would not take their eyes off her. Gervaise went toward Lorilleux as she spoke.","Thereupon the Lorilleuxs pursed their lips and exchanged covert glances. So Clump-clump was begging now! Well, the fall was complete. But they did not care for that kind of thing by any means. If they had known, they would have barricaded the door, for people should always be on their guard against beggars—folks who make their way into apartments under a pretext and carry precious objects away with them; and especially so in this place, as there was something worth while stealing. One might lay one’s fingers no matter where, and carry off thirty or forty francs by merely closing the hands. They had felt suspicious several times already on noticing how strange Gervaise looked when she stuck herself in front of the gold. This time, however, they meant to watch her. And as she approached nearer, with her feet on the board, the chainmaker roughly called out, without giving any further answer to her question: “Look out, pest—take care; you’ll be carrying some scraps of gold away on the soles of your shoes."
"Alors, le train-train de la maison reprit, tout se calma et s'assoupit dans de nouvelles habitudes. Gervaise s'était accoutumée à la débandade du linge sale, aux allées et venues de Lantier. Celui-ci parlait toujours de ses grandes affaires ; il sortait parfois, bien peigné, avec du linge blanc, disparaissait, découchait même, puis rentrait en affectant d'être éreinté, d'avoir la tête cassée, comme s'il venait de discuter, vingt-quatre heures durant, les plus graves intérêts. La vérité était qu'il la coulait douce. Oh ! il n'y avait pas de danger qu'il empoignât des durillons aux mains ! Il se levait d'ordinaire vers dix heures, faisait une promenade l'après-midi, si la couleur du soleil lui plaisait, ou bien, les jours de pluie, restait dans la boutique où il parcourait son journal. C'était son milieu, il crevait d'aise parmi les jupes, se fourrait au plus épais des femmes, adorant leurs gros mots, les poussant à en dire, tout en gardant lui-même un langage choisi ; et ça expliquait pourquoi il aimait tant à se frotter aux blanchisseuses, des filles pas bégueules. Lorsque Clémence lui dévidait son chapelet, il demeurait tendre et souriant, en tordant ses minces moustaches. L'odeur de l'atelier, ces ouvrières en sueur qui tapaient les fers de leurs bras nus, tout ce coin pareil à une alcôve où tramait le déballage des dames du quartier, semblait être pour lui le trou rêvé, un refuge longtemps cherché de paresse et de jouissance.","Then the routine of the house resumed, everything calmed down and dozed off in new habits. Gervaise had grown accustomed to the rout of dirty linen, to Lantier's comings and goings. The latter was always talking about his big business; he sometimes went out, well combed, with white linen, disappeared, even slept, then came home pretending to be exhausted, to have his head broken, as if he had just discussed, twenty-four hours during, the most serious interests. The truth was that he was taking it easy. Oh ! there was no danger that he would grab calluses on his hands! He usually got up around ten o'clock, took an afternoon walk, if the color of the sun pleased him, or else, on rainy days, stayed in the shop where he looked through his newspaper. It was his environment, he was bursting with joy among the skirts, stuffing himself with the thickest of women, adoring their swear words, pushing them to say them, while keeping a chosen language himself; and that explained why he was so fond of rubbing shoulders with laundresses, girls who weren't prudish. When Clemence unrolled his rosary, he remained tender and smiling, twisting his thin mustaches. The smell of the workshop, these sweaty workers beating the irons of their bare arms, this whole corner like an alcove where the unpacking of the ladies of the neighborhood was plotting, seemed to be for him the hole dreamed of, a refuge long sought after by laziness and enjoyment.","Finally it was decided that Etienne should go, and when the morning of his departure arrived Lantier read his son a long lecture and then sent him off, and the house settled down into new habits. Gervaise became accustomed to seeing the dirty linen lying about and to seeing Lantier coming in and going out. He still talked with an important air of his business operations. He went out daily, dressed with the utmost care and came home, declaring that he was worn out with the discussions in which he had been engaged and which involved the gravest and most important interests. He rose about ten o'clock, took a walk if the day pleased him, and if it rained he sat in the shop and read his paper. He liked to be there. It was his delight to live surrounded by a circle of worshiping women, and he basked indolently in the warmth and atmosphere of ease and comfort, which characterized the place.","The household was now able to get into the new routine. Gervaise became accustomed to having dirty laundry lying all around. Lantier was forever talking of important business deals. Sometimes he went out, wearing fresh linen and neatly combed. He would stay out all night and on his return pretend that he was completely exhausted because he had been discussing very serious matters. Actually he was merely taking life easy. He usually slept until ten. In the afternoons he would take a walk if the weather was nice. If it was raining, he would sit in the shop reading his newspaper. This atmosphere suited him. He always felt at his ease with women and enjoyed listening to them."
"- Oh ! là, là, ça gazouille ! dit Clémence, en se bouchant le nez.","- Oh ! there, there, it's chirping! said Clemence, holding her nose.",""" At the same time, however, Gervaise amiably laid down her work and went for the dirty clothes, which she piled up in the back shop.","“Oh! La, la. What a stench!” said Clemence, holding her nose."
"- Écoute, je t'en supplie.. Laisse le couteau ? Reste à ta place, ne fais pas un malheur.","- Listen, please. Leave the knife? Stay in your place, don't make a mess.","""Put down that knife,"" she said, ""and do not go out, I entreat of you.""","“Listen to me, I implore you. Leave the knife alone. Remain where you are, don’t do anything dreadful.”"
"- Qu'est-ce que cette vermine a encore fait du polonais ? murmurait Gervaise, en parlant d'Augustine.","- What did that vermin do with Polish again? murmured Gervaise, speaking of Augustine.","The stove and the irons were alike red hot; she must wait a quarter of an hour before she could touch the irons, and Gervaise covered the fire with a couple of shovelfuls of cinders.","“Whatever has that vermin done with my little iron?” murmured Gervaise, speaking of Augustine."
"- Ça ne vous empêchera pas d'y passer, ma petite ? Vous serez peut-être bien contente d'y passer, un jour ? Oui, j'en connais des femmes, qui diraient merci, si on les emportait.","- That won't stop you from going there, my little one? Maybe you'll be happy to go there one day? Yes, I know some women who would say thank you if we took them away.","""You won't mind it so much one of these days, my dear. I know something about women.","“That won’t prevent you passing though our hands, my little woman. You’ll perhaps be glad to do so, one of these days. Yes, I know some women who’d be much obliged if we did carry them off.”"
"Autour d'elles, les blanchisseuses ne riaient plus ; plusieurs s'en étaient allées, en disant que ça leur cassait l'estomac ; les autres, celles qui restaient, allongeaient le cou, les yeux allumés d'une lueur de cruauté, trouvant ces gaillardes-là très crânes. Madame Boche avait emmené Claude et Etienne ; et l'on entendait, à l'autre bout, l'éclat de leurs sanglots mêlé aux heurts sonores des deux battoirs.","Around them the laundresses were no longer laughing; several had gone away, saying that it broke their stomachs; the others, those who remained, stretched out their necks, their eyes lit up with a gleam of cruelty, finding these strapping ladies very spunky. Madame Boche had taken Claude and Etienne; and one could hear, at the other end, the burst of their sobs mingled with the sonorous clashes of the two beaters.","The women about them ceased to laugh; many went away, saying they were faint. Those who remained watched the scene with a cruel light in their eyes. Mme Boche had taken Claude and Etienne to the other end of the room, whence came the dreary sound of their sobs which were heard through the dull blows of the beaters.","The other women around them no longer laughed. Several had gone off saying that it quite upset them; those who remained stretched out their necks, their eyes lighted up with a gleam of cruelty, admiring the pluck displayed. Madame Boche had led Claude and Etienne away, and one could hear at the other end of the building the sound of their sobs, mingled with the sonorous shocks of the two beetles."
"Ah ! oui, Gervaise avait fini sa journée ! Elle était plus éreintée que tout ce peuple de travailleurs, dont le passage venait de la secouer. Elle pouvait se coucher là et crever, car le travail ne voulait plus d'elle, et elle avait assez peiné dans son existence, pour dire : « A qui le tour ? moi, j'en ai ma claque ! » Tout le monde mangeait, à cette heure. C'était bien la fin, le soleil avait soufflé sa chandelle, la nuit serait longue. Mon Dieu ! s'étendre à son aise et ne plus se relever, penser qu'on a remisé ses outils pour toujours et qu'on fera la vache éternellement ! Voilà qui est bon, après s'être esquintée pendant vingt ans ! Et Gervaise, dans les crampes qui lui tordaient l'estomac, pensait malgré elle aux jours de fête, aux gueuletons et aux rigolades de sa vie. Une fois surtout, par un froid de chien, un jeudi de la mi-carême, elle avait joliment nocé. Elle était bien gentille, blonde et fraîche, en ce temps-là. Son lavoir, rue Neuve, l'avait nommée reine, malgré sa jambe. Alors, on s'était baladé sur les boulevards, dans des chars ornés de verdure, au milieu du beau monde qui la reluquait joliment. Des messieurs mettaient leurs lorgnons comme pour une vraie reine. Puis, le soir, on avait fichu un Balthazar à tout casser, et jusqu'au jour on avait joué des guiboles. Reine, oui, reine ! avec une couronne et une écharpe, pendant vingt-quatre heures, deux fois le tour du cadran ! Et, alourdie, dans les tortures de sa faim, elle regardait par terre, comme si elle eût cherché le ruisseau où elle avait laissé choir sa majesté tombée.","Ah! yes, Gervaise had finished her day! She was more exhausted than all those people of workers whose passage had just shaken her. She could lie there and die, because work didn't want her anymore, and she had struggled enough in her life to say, ""Who's next?"" me, I'm sick of it! Everyone was eating at this hour. It was indeed the end, the sun had blown out its candle, the night would be long. My God ! stretch out at ease and never get up again, thinking that you've put your tools away forever and that you'll be cowing forever! That's good, after having toiled away for twenty years! And Gervaise, in the cramps that twisted her stomach, thought in spite of herself of the holidays, the feasts and the jokes of her life. Once especially, in bitter cold, on a mid-Lent Thursday, she had had a pretty wedding. She was very nice, blond and fresh, in those days. Her laundrette, rue Neuve, had named her queen, in spite of her leg. So we strolled along the boulevards, in floats adorned with greenery, in the middle of the beautiful people who eyed her prettily. Gentlemen put on their eyeglasses as if for a real queen. Then, in the evening, we had screwed up a Balthazar to break everything, and until daylight we had played guiboles. Queen, yes, queen! with a crown and a scarf, for twenty-four hours, twice around the dial! And, weighed down, in the pangs of her hunger, she looked down at the ground, as if she were looking for the stream where she had dropped her fallen majesty.","By degrees the crowd dispersed, and Gervaise was almost alone. Everyone was at dinner. She thought how delicious it would be to lie down and never rise again—to feel that all toil was over. And this was the end of her life! Gervaise, amid the pangs of hunger, thought of some of the fete days she had known and remembered that she had not always been miserable. Once she was pretty, fair and fresh. She had been a kind and admired mistress in her shop. Gentlemen came to it only to see her, and she vaguely wondered where all this youth and this beauty had fled. Again she looked up; she had reached the abattoirs, which were now being torn down; the fronts were taken away, showing the dark holes within, the very stones of which reeked with blood.","Ah! yes; Gervaise had finished her day! She was wearier even than all this mob of toilers who had jostled her as they went by. She might lie down there and croak, for work would have nothing more to do with her, and she had toiled enough during her life to say: “Whose turn now? I’ve had enough.” At present everyone was eating. It was really the end, the sun had blown out its candle, the night would be a long one. Mon Dieu! To stretch one’s self at one’s ease and never get up again; to think one had put one’s tools by for good and that one could ruminate like a cow forever! That’s what is good, after tiring one’s self out for twenty years! And Gervaise, as hunger twisted her stomach, thought in spite of herself of the fete days, the spreads and the revelry of her life. Of one occasion especially, an awfully cold day, a mid-Lent Thursday. She had enjoyed herself wonderfully well. She was very pretty, fair-haired and fresh looking at that time. Her wash-house in the Rue Neuve had chosen her as queen in spite of her leg. And then they had had an outing on the boulevards in carts decked with greenery, in the midst of stylish people who ogled her. Real gentlemen put up their glasses as if she had been a true queen. In the evening there was a wonderful spread, and then they had danced till daylight. Queen; yes Queen! With a crown and a sash for twenty-four hours—twice round the clock! And now oppressed by hunger, she looked on the ground, as if she were seeking for the gutter in which she had let her fallen majesty tumble."
"- Encore un ! ? Rince-toi les dents, fais ta toilette pour ton quart de ce soir, au coin de la rue Belhomme.","- One again ! ? Rinse your teeth, get dressed for your shift tonight, at the corner of rue Belhomme.","It is good to have a bath once in your life!""","“Another one! Brush your teeth, fix yourself up for your post to-night at the corner of the Rue Belhomme.”"
"- Ah bien ! il n'est pas poivre, non, c'est que je tousse ! disait Nana embêtée. Moi, je m'esbigne, vous savez ! Je n'ai pas envie qu'il secoue mes puces ? Tiens ! il a piqué une tête ! Dieu de Dieu, s'il pouvait se casser la gueule !","- Ah well ! it's not pepper, no, it's that I'm coughing! said Nana annoyed. Me, I make do, you know! I don't want him to shake my chips? Take ! he took a dip! God of God, if he could beat himself up!","""Look!"" cried Pauline. ""Your father is coming, Nana."" Then the girl would crouch on her knees and bid the others stand close around her, and when he had passed on after an inquiring look she would jump up and they would all utter peals of laughter.","“Well, he’s drunk too. Oh, dear,” said Nana, greatly bothered. “I’m going to beat it, you know. I don’t want him to give me a wallop. Hullo! How he stumbles! Good Lord, if he could only break his neck!”"
- Ah ! le feu de madame Lerat qui est éteint ! cria l'atelier.,- Oh! Madame Lerat's fire which is extinguished! cried the workshop.,Nana listened to the conversation which followed—reveling in indecency—as much at home in it as a fish is in water.,“Oh! Madame Lerat’s fire’s out!” laughed the whole shop.
"Gervaise, retombée sur la chaise, se plaignait doucement, par courtes phrases.","Gervaise, having fallen back into the chair, was complaining softly, in short phrases.",Gervaise had dropped upon her chair again and uttered disjointed phrases of lamentation.,"Gervaise, who had fallen back on her chair, gently complained, in short sentences: “I’ve not had a wink of sleep."
"Justement, les Boche, depuis le terme d'avril, avaient quitté la rue des Poissonniers et tenaient la loge de la grande maison, rue de la Goutte-d'Or. Comme ça se rencontrait, tout de même ! Un des ennuis de Gervaise, qui avait vécu si tranquille sans concierge dans son trou de la rue Neuve, était de retomber sous la sujétion de quelque mauvaise bête, avec laquelle il faudrait se disputer pour un peu d'eau répandue, ou pour la porte refermée trop fort, le soir. Les concierges sont une si sale espèce ! Mais, avec les Boche, ce serait un plaisir. On se connaissait, on s'entendrait toujours. Enfin, ça se passerait en famille.","It so happened that the Boches had left the rue des Poissonniers since the end of April and were in charge of the big house in the rue de la Goutte-d'Or. How it met, all the same! One of Gervaise's annoyances, who had lived so peacefully without a concierge in her hole in the rue Neuve, was to fall back into the subjection of some bad animal, with whom it would be necessary to argue for a little spilled water, or for the door. closed too tightly in the evening. Janitors are such a filthy species! But, with the Boche, it would be a pleasure. We knew each other, we would always get along. Well, it would be family.","AMBITIOUS DREAMS The Boche couple, on the first of April, moved also and took the loge of the great house in the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or. Things had turned out very nicely for Gervaise who, having always got on very comfortably with the concierge in the house in Rue Neuve, dreaded lest she should fall into the power of some tyrant who would quarrel over every drop of water that was spilled and a thousand other trifles like that. But with Mme Boche all would go smoothly.","It so happened that the Boches had left the Rue des Poissonniers at the April quarter, and were now taking charge of the great house in the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or. It was a curious coincidence, all the same! One thing that worried Gervaise who had lived so quietly in her lodgings in the Rue Neuve, was the thought of again being under the subjection of some unpleasant person, with whom she would be continually quarrelling, either on account of water spilt in the passage or of a door shut too noisily at night-time. Concierges are such a disagreeable class! But it would be a pleasure to be with the Boches. They knew one another—they would always get on well together. It would be just like members of the same family."
"- Ah ! ce voleur de père Colombe ! reprit la voix. Vous savez, il nous faut de la vieille, et pas des coquilles de noix, de vrais verres !","- Oh! that thief Father Colombe! resumed the voice. You know, we need old, not nutshells, real glasses!","Five workmen went in, and the same voice said: ""Father Colombe, be honest now. Give us honest glasses, and no nutshells, if you please.""","“Ah! Here’s that thief, Pere Colombe!” the voice continued. “We want the real old stuff, you know. And full sized glasses, too.”"
Il cria :,He shouted :,"As he thrust his knife into the breast Lorilleux was seized with momentary patriotism, and he exclaimed:",“Ah! if it was a Cossack!” he cried.
- Prenez garde ! cria Coupeau.,- Take care! cried Coupeau.,"""Take care!"" cried Coupeau.","“Watch your step,” warned Coupeau."
"C'était un immense hangar, à plafond plat, à poutres apparentes, monté sur des piliers de fonte, fermé par de larges fenêtres claires. Un plein jour blafard passait librement dans la buée chaude suspendue comme un brouillard laiteux. Des fumées montaient de certains coins, s'étalant, noyant les fonds d'un voile bleuâtre. Il pleuvait une humidité lourde, chargée d'une odeur savonneuse, une odeur fade, moite, continue ; et, par moments, des souffles plus forts d'eau de javelle dominaient. Le long des batteries, aux deux côtés de l'allée centrale, il y avait des files de femmes, les bras nus jusqu'aux épaules, le cou nu, les jupes raccourcies montrant des bas de couleur et de gros souliers lacés. Elles tapaient furieusement, riaient, se renversaient pour crier un mot dans le vacarme, se penchaient au fond de leurs baquets, ordurières, brutales, dégingandées, trempées comme par une averse, les chairs rougies et fumantes. Autour d'elles, sous elles, coulait un grand ruissellement, les seaux d'eau chaude promenés et vidés d'un trait, les robinets d'eau froide ouverts, pissant de haut, les éclaboussements des battoirs, les égouttures des linges rincés, les mares où elles pataugeaient s'en allant par petits ruisseaux sur les dalles en pente. Et, au milieu des cris, des coups cadencés, du bruit murmurant de pluie, de cette clameur d'orage s'étouffant sous le plafond mouillé, la machine à vapeur, à droite, toute blanche d'une rosée fine, haletait et ronflait sans relâche, avec la trépidation dansante de son volant qui semblait régler l'énormité du tapage.","It was an immense shed, with a flat ceiling, exposed beams, mounted on cast iron pillars, closed by large clear windows. A pallid broad daylight passed freely through the warm mist hanging like a milky mist. Smoke rose from certain corners, spreading out, drowning the depths with a bluish veil. It was raining down a heavy dampness, laden with a soapy smell, a bland, moist, continuous smell; and, at times, stronger breaths of bleach dominated. Along the batteries, on both sides of the central aisle, there were rows of women, their arms bare to the shoulders, their necks bare, their skirts shortened showing colored stockings and heavy laced shoes. They beat furiously, laughed, threw themselves back to shout a word in the uproar, leaned over the bottom of their tubs, filthy, brutal, lanky, soaked as if by a downpour, their flesh reddened and smoking. Around them, under them, flowed a great stream, the buckets of hot water being carried around and emptied in one gulp, the cold water taps open, pissing from above, the splashes from the beaters, the drippings from the rinsed linens, the ponds in which they waded, flowing in little streams over the sloping flagstones. And, amid the cries, the rhythmic knocks, the murmuring sound of rain, this stormy clamor choking under the wet ceiling, the steam engine, on the right, all white with a fine dew, panted and hummed. relentlessly, with the dancing trepidation of its steering wheel which seemed to regulate the enormity of the din.","It was an immense shed, as it were, with a low ceiling—the beams and rafters unconcealed—and lighted by large windows, through which the daylight streamed. A light gray mist or steam pervaded the room, which was filled with a smell of soapsuds and eau de Javelle combined. Along the central aisle were tubs on either side, and two rows of women with their arms bare to the shoulders and their skirts tucked up stood showing their colored stockings and stout laced shoes. They rubbed and pounded furiously, straightening themselves occasionally to utter a sentence and then applying themselves again to their task, with the steam and perspiration pouring down their red faces. There was a constant rush of water from the faucets, a great splashing as the clothes were rinsed and pounding and banging of the beaters, while amid all this noise the steam engine in the corner kept up its regular puffing.","It was an immense shed, with large clear windows, and a flat ceiling, showing the beams supported on cast-iron pillars. Pale rays of light passed through the hot steam, which remained suspended like a milky fog. Smoke arose from certain corners, spreading about and covering the recesses with a bluish veil. A heavy moisture hung around, impregnated with a soapy odor, a damp insipid smell, continuous though at moments overpowered by the more potent fumes of the chemicals. Along the washing-places, on either side of the central alley, were rows of women, with bare arms and necks, and skirts tucked up, showing colored stockings and heavy lace-up shoes. They were beating furiously, laughing, leaning back to call out a word in the midst of the din, or stooping over their tubs, all of them brutal, ungainly, foul of speech, and soaked as though by a shower, with their flesh red and reeking. All around the women continuously flowed a river from hot-water buckets emptied with a sudden splash, cold-water faucets left dripping, soap suds spattering, and the dripping from rinsed laundry which was hung up. It splashed their feet and drained away across the sloping flagstones. The din of the shouting and the rhythmic beating was joined by the patter of steady dripping. It was slightly muffled by the moisture-soaked ceiling. Meanwhile, the steam engine could be heard as it puffed and snorted ceaselessly while cloaked in its white mist. The dancing vibration of its flywheel seemed to regulate the volume of the noisy turbulence."

"Quand elle fut entrée, Lorilleux s'arrêta également sur le seuil, et il attendit aussi d'être embrassé, avant de pénétrer dans la boutique. Ni l'un ni l'autre n'avait apporté de bouquet ; ils s'y étaient refusés, ils trouvaient qu'ils auraient trop l'air de se soumettre à la Banban, s'ils arrivaient chez elle avec des fleurs, la première fois. Cependant, Gervaise criait à Augustine de donner deux litres. Puis, sur un bout de la table, elle versa des verres de vin, appela tout le monde. Et chacun prit un verre, on trinqua à la bonne amitié de la famille. Il y eut un silence, la société buvait, les dames levaient le coude, d'un trait, jusqu'à la dernière goutte.","When she entered, Lorilleux also stopped on the threshold, and he too waited to be kissed before entering the shop. Neither had brought a bouquet; they had refused, they thought they would seem too much to submit to Banban if they arrived at her house with flowers the first time. However, Gervaise shouted at Augustine to give two liters. Then, on one end of the table, she poured out glasses of wine, called everyone. And everyone had a drink, we toasted to the good friendship of the family. There was a silence, the company drank, the ladies raised their elbows, all at once, to the last drop.","After she was ushered in the same program had to be followed out with her husband. Neither of the two brought any flowers. They had refused to do so, saying that it would look as if they were bowing down to Wooden Legs. Gervaise summoned Augustine and bade her bring some wine and then filled glasses for all the party, and each drank the health of the family.","When she had entered Lorilleux also stopped at the threshold and he likewise waited to be embraced before penetrating into the shop. Neither the one nor the other had brought a bouquet. They had decided not to do so as they thought it would look too much like giving way to Clump-clump if they carried flowers with them the first time they set foot in her home. Gervaise called to Augustine to bring two bottles of wine. Then, filling some glasses on a corner of the table, she called everyone to her. And each took a glass and drank to the good friendship of the family. There was a pause whilst the guests were drinking, the ladies raising their elbows and emptying their glasses to the last drop."
"Les Goujet se montrèrent très gentils pour Gervaise pendant la maladie de Coupeau. Madame Goujet était à son entière disposition ; elle ne descendait pas une fois sans lui demander si elle avait besoin de sucre, de beurre, de sel ; elle lui offrait toujours le premier bouillon, les soirs où elle mettait un pot-au-feu ; même, si elle la voyait trop occupée, elle soignait sa cuisine, lui donnait un coup de main pour la vaisselle. Goujet, chaque matin, prenait les seaux de la jeune femme, allait les emplir à la fontaine de la rue des Poissonniers ; c'était une économie de deux sous.","The Goujets were very kind to Gervaise during Coupeau's illness. Madame Goujet was entirely at his disposal; she never went downstairs without asking her if she needed sugar, butter, salt; she always offered him the first broth on the evenings when she put on a pot-au-feu; even, if she saw her too busy, she took care of her cooking, gave her a hand with the dishes. Every morning Goujet took the young woman's buckets and went to fill them at the fountain in the rue des Poissonniers; it was a saving of two sous.","Her neighbors next door had been very kind and thoughtful to Gervaise all through her trouble and the illness of her husband. Mme Goujet never went out without coming to inquire if there was anything she could do, any commission she could execute. She brought innumerable bowls of soup and, even when Gervaise was particularly busy, washed her dishes for her. Goujet filled her buckets every morning with fresh water, and this was an economy of at least two sous, and in the evening came to sit with Coupeau.","While Coupeau was bed-ridden the Goujets were very kind to Gervaise. Madame Goujet was always ready to assist. She never went to shop without stopping to ask Gervaise if there was anything she needed, sugar or butter or salt. She always brought over hot bouillon on the evenings she cooked pot au feu. Sometimes, when Gervaise seemed to have too much to do, Madame Goujet helped her do the dishes, or cleaned the kitchen herself. Goujet took her water pails every morning and filled them at the tap on Rue des Poissonniers, saving her two sous a day."
- Dans cinquante ans d'ici ! cria Virginie.,- Fifty years from now! Virginia shouted.,"""And fifty more birthdays!"" cried Virginie.",“Here’s to this day fifty years hence!” cried Virginie.
"- De quoi, les principes ! ? Il n'y a pas de principes ? il n'y a pas de principes ? il n'y a que l'honnêteté !","- Of what, the principles! ? There are no principles? there are no principles? only honesty!","Be off with you!""","“Well! What? Principles! There’s no such thing as principles, there’s no such thing as principles—there’s only common decency!”"
"- Je n'ai pas osé aller chez la laitière, parce que nous lui devons huit jours, expliqua Gervaise. Mais je reviendrai de bonne heure, tu iras chercher du pain et des côtelettes panées, pendant que je ne serai pas là, et nous déjeunerons ? Prends aussi un litre de vin.","""I didn't dare go to the dairy, because we owe her a week,"" explained Gervaise. But I'll be back early, you'll get some bread and breaded cutlets, while I'm not there, and we'll have lunch? Also take a liter of wine.","""I did not dare go to the milk woman,"" explained Gervaise, ""because we owe her for eight days. But I shall be back early. You can get some bread and some chops and have them ready. Don't forget the wine too.""","“I didn’t dare go to the milkwoman’s, because we owe her a week,” explained Gervaise. “But I shall be back early; you can get some bread and some chops whilst I’m away, and then we’ll have lunch. Bring also a bottle of wine.”"
"Et elle raconta son voyage. Ensuite, elle demanda pourquoi on ne connaissait pas le nom d'Etienne dans l'atelier. Goujet riait ; il lui expliqua que tout le monde appelait le petit Zouzou, parce qu'il avait des cheveux coupés ras, pareils à ceux d'un zouave. Pendant qu'ils causaient ensemble, Etienne ne tirait plus le soufflet, la flamme de la forge baissait, une clarté rose se mourait, au milieu du hangar redevenu noir. Le forgeron attendri regardait la jeune femme souriante, toute fraîche dans cette lueur. Puis, comme tous deux ne se disaient plus rien, noyés de ténèbres, il parut se souvenir, il rompit le silence :","And she recounted her journey. Then she asked why Etienne's name was not known in the workshop. Goujet laughed; he explained to her that everyone called little Zouzou because he had close-cropped hair, like that of a Zouave. While they were talking together, Etienne no longer pulled the bellows, the flame in the forge was dying, a rosy light was dying in the middle of the shed, which had become dark again. The tender blacksmith looked at the smiling young woman, fresh in this light. Then, as the two said nothing more to each other, drowned in darkness, he seemed to remember, he broke the silence:","he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","After telling about her journey, she asked why no one in the shop knew Etienne’s name. Goujet laughed and explained to her that everybody called him “Little Zouzou” because he had his hair cut short like that of a Zouave. While they were talking together Etienne stopped working the bellows and the flame of the forge dwindled to a rosy glow amid the gathering darkness. Touched by the presence of this smiling young woman, the blacksmith stood gazing at her. Then, as neither continued speaking, he seemed to recollect and broke the silence:"
"Et, baissant la voix, à l'oreille de Claude :","And, lowering his voice, in Claude's ear:","And then, lowering her voice, she whispered in the child's ear:","And, lowering her voice, she whispered in Claude’s ear: “"

Is it to bother me that you're drinking and yelling in there with your whores? I'm going to demolish you, me, in your cabin! ? For God Sake ! will you leave me alone!","""More trickery,"" he howled. ""I knew it!""","“More traps, all that! I thought as much. Silence, you set of swindlers! Yes, you’re making a fool of me. It’s for that that you’re drinking and bawling inside there with your viragoes. I’ll demolish you, you and your cottage! Damnation! Will you leave me in peace?”"
"L'accident de Coupeau avait mis la famille en l'air. Maman Coupeau passait les nuits avec Gervaise ; mais, dès neuf heures, elle s'endormait sur sa chaise. Chaque soir, en rentrant du travail, madame Lerat faisait un grand détour pour prendre des nouvelles. Les Lorilleux étaient d'abord venus deux et trois fois par jour, offrant de veiller, apportant même un fauteuil pour Gervaise. Puis, des querelles n'avaient pas tardé à s'élever sur la façon de soigner les malades. Madame Lorilleux prétendait avoir sauvé assez de gens dans sa vie pour savoir comment il fallait s'y prendre. Elle accusait aussi la jeune femme de la bousculer, de l'écarter du lit de son frère. Bien sûr, la Banban avait raison de vouloir quand même guérir Coupeau ; car enfin, si elle n'était pas allée le déranger rue de la Nation, il ne serait pas tombé. Seulement, de la manière dont elle l'accommodait, elle était certaine de l'achever.","Coupeau's accident had upset the family. Maman Coupeau spent the nights with Gervaise; but at nine o'clock she fell asleep in her chair. Every evening, on returning from work, Madame Lerat made a long detour to check on her. The Lorilleuxs had first come two or three times a day, offering to watch, even bringing an armchair for Gervaise. Then, quarrels had not been long in rising on the way of caring for the patients. Madame Lorilleux claimed to have saved enough people in her life to know how to go about it. She also accused the young woman of pushing her aside, pushing her away from her brother's bed. Of course, the Banban was right to still want to cure Coupeau; because after all, if she hadn't gone to disturb him in the Rue de la Nation, he wouldn't have fallen. Only, the way she accommodated him, she was sure to finish him off.","This accident to Coupeau brought all his family about him. His mother spent the nights there, but she slept in her chair quite comfortably. Mme Lerat came in every evening after work was over to make inquiries. The Lorilleuxs at first came three or four times each day and brought an armchair for Gervaise, but soon quarrels and discussions arose as to the proper way of nursing the invalid, and Mme Lorilleux lost her temper and declared that had Gervaise stayed at home and not gone to pester her husband when he was at work the accident would not have happened. When she saw Coupeau out of danger Gervaise allowed his family to approach him as they saw fit.","Coupeau’s accident had created quite a commotion in the family. Mother Coupeau passed the nights with Gervaise; but as early as nine o’clock she fell asleep on a chair. Every evening, on returning from work, Madame Lerat went a long round out of her way to inquire how her brother was getting on. At first the Lorilleuxs had called two or three times a day, offering to sit up and watch, and even bringing an easy-chair for Gervaise. Then it was not long before there were disputes as to the proper way to nurse invalids. Madame Lorilleux said that she had saved enough people’s lives to know how to go about it. She accused the young wife of pushing her aside, of driving her away from her own brother’s bed. Certainly that Clump-clump ought to be concerned about Coupeau’s getting well, for if she hadn’t gone to Rue de la Nation to disturb him at his job, he would never had fallen. Only, the way she was taking care of him, she would certainly finish him."
"Elle avait un visage si terrible, que personne n'osa approcher. Les forces décuplées, elle saisit Virginie par la taille, la plia, lui colla la figure sur les dalles, les reins en l'air ; et, malgré les secousses, elle lui releva les jupes, largement. Dessous, il y avait un pantalon. Elle passa la main dans la fente, l'arracha, montra tout, les cuisses nues, les fesses nues. Puis, le battoir levé, elle se mit à battre, comme elle battait autrefois à Plassans, au bord de la Viorne, quand sa patronne lavait le linge de la garnison. Le bois mollissait dans les chairs avec un bruit mouillé. A chaque tape, une bande rouge marbrait la peau blanche.","She had such a terrible face that no one dared approach. Strengthened tenfold, she seized Virginie by the waist, bent her, stuck her face to the flagstones, her loins in the air; and, in spite of the jolts, she lifted her skirts, widely. Underneath were pants. She put her hand in the slot, tore it off, showed everything, bare thighs, bare buttocks. Then, the beater raised, she began to beat, as she used to beat at Plassans, on the banks of the Viorne, when her mistress was washing the clothes of the garrison. The wood softened in the flesh with a wet noise. With each tap, a red band marbled the white skin.","With almost superhuman strength she seized Virginie by the waist, bent her forward with her face to the brick floor and, notwithstanding her struggles, lifted her skirts and showed the white and naked skin. Then she brought her beater down as she had formerly done at Plassans under the trees on the riverside, where her employer had washed the linen of the garrison. Each blow of the beater fell on the soft flesh with a dull thud, leaving a scarlet mark.","Her face bore such a terrible expression, that no one dared approach her. Her strength seemed to have increased tenfold. She seized Virginie round the waist, bent her down and pressed her face against the flagstones. Raising her beetle she commenced beating as she used to beat at Plassans, on the banks of the Viorne, when her mistress washed the clothes of the garrison. The wood seemed to yield to the flesh with a damp sound. At each whack a red weal marked the white skin."
"- Dis donc, le petit veau, regarde ça ; c'est un cadeau pour toi. Oui, c'est encore cinquante sous que tu me coûtes ? Avec ce joujou-là, je ne serai plus obligé de courir, et tu auras beau te fourrer dans les coins. Veux-tu essayer ? ? Ah ! tu casses les tasses ! ? Allons, houp ! danse donc, fais donc des révérences à M. Hardi !","- Hey, little calf, look at that; it's a gift for you. Yes, are you still costing me fifty sous? With this toy, I won't have to run anymore, and you can get into corners in vain. Would you like to try ? ? Ah! you break the cups! ? Come on, whoops! So dance, bow to M. Hardi!","""Look here, fool,"" he said grimly: ""I bought this for you, and it cost me fifty sous, but I expect to get a good deal more than fifty sous' worth of good out of it. With this long lash I need not run about after you, for I can reach you in every corner of the room. You will break the cups, will you? Come, now, jump about a little and say good morning to Mr Wind again!""","“See, little chickie, look at this. It’s a present for you. Yes, it’s another fifty sous you’ve cost me. With this plaything I shall no longer be obliged to run after you, and it’ll be no use you getting into the corners. Will you have a try? Ah! you broke a cup! Now then, gee up! Dance away, make your curtsies to Monsieur Hardy!”"
"- Voilà du chien, attends ! Apprête ton linge sale !","- That's some dog, wait! Get your dirty laundry ready!","""This will be as good for you as for your dirty linen!""",“Here’s something that’ll settle you! Get your dirty linen ready!”
"Gervaise obéit. Elle retourna dans le coin, recommença à laver. Agenouillée par terre, au milieu de l'eau sale, elle se pliait en deux, les épaules saillantes, les bras violets et raidis. Son vieux jupon trempé lui collait aux fesses. Elle faisait sur le parquet un tas de quelque chose de pas propre, dépeignée, montrant par les trous de sa camisole l'enflure de son corps, un débordement de chairs molles qui voyageaient, roulaient et sautaient, sous les rudes secousses de sa besogne ; et elle suait tellement, que, de son visage inondé, pissaient de grosses gouttes.","Gervaise obeys. She went back to the corner, started washing again. Kneeling on the ground, in the middle of the dirty water, she doubled over, her shoulders protruding, her arms purple and stiff. Her old soaked petticoat clung to her buttocks. She was making a heap of something untidy, scruffy on the floor, showing through the holes in her camisole the swelling of her body, an overflow of soft flesh which traveled, rolled and jumped under the harsh jolts of her work; and she was sweating so much that large drops were pissing from her flooded face.","Gervaise obeyed. She went back to the corner and scrubbed it again. She was on her hands and knees, with her sleeves rolled up over her arms. Her old skirt clung close to her stout form, and the sweat poured down her face.","Gervaise obeyed. She returned to the corner and began to scrub again. She bent double on her knees in the midst of the dirty water, with her shoulders protruding, her arms stiff and purple with cold. Her old skirt, fairly soaked, stuck to her figure. And there on the floor she looked a dirty, ill-combed drab, the rents in her jacket showing her puffy form, her fat, flabby flesh which heaved, swayed and floundered about as she went about her work; and all the while she perspired to such a point that from her moist face big drops of sweat fell on to the floor."
"Quand Gervaise s'éveilla, vers cinq heures, raidie, les reins brisés, elle éclata en sanglots. Lantier n'était pas rentré. Pour la première fois, il découchait. Elle resta assise au bord du lit, sous le lambeau de perse déteinte qui tombait de la flèche attachée au plafond par une ficelle. Et, lentement, de ses yeux voilés de larmes, elle faisait le tour de la misérable chambre garnie, meublée d'une commode de noyer dont un tiroir manquait, de trois chaises de paille et d'une petite table graisseuse, sur laquelle traînait un pot à eau ébréché. On avait ajouté, pour les enfants, un lit de fer qui barrait la commode et emplissait les deux tiers de la pièce. La malle de Gervaise et de Lantier, grande ouverte dans un coin, montrait ses flancs vides, un vieux chapeau d'homme tout au fond, enfoui sous des chemises et des chaussettes sales ; tandis que, le long des murs, sur le dossier des meubles, pendaient un châle troué, un pantalon mangé par la boue, les dernières nippes dont les marchands d'habits ne voulaient pas. Au milieu de la cheminée, entre deux flambeaux de zinc dépareillés, il y avait un paquet de reconnaissances du Mont-de-Piété, d'un rose tendre. C'était la belle chambre de l'hôtel, la chambre du premier, qui donnait sur le boulevard.","When Gervaise awoke around five o'clock, stiff, her back broken, she burst into tears. Lantier had not returned. For the first time, he was sleeping. She remained seated on the edge of the bed, under the shred of faded Persian that fell from the spire attached to the ceiling by a string. And slowly, with her eyes veiled with tears, she made the tour of the miserable furnished room, furnished with a walnut chest of drawers with one drawer missing, three straw chairs and a small greasy table, on which lay a chipped water jug. An iron bed had been added for the children, which barred the chest of drawers and filled two-thirds of the room. Gervaise and Lantier's trunk, wide open in one corner, showed its empty sides, an old man's hat at the very bottom, buried under dirty shirts and socks; while along the walls, on the backs of the furniture, hung a ragged shawl, mud-eaten trousers, the last clothes the clothes-sellers didn't want. In the middle of the fireplace, between two mismatched zinc candlesticks, there was a packet of recognitions from the Mont-de-Piete, of a soft pink. It was the beautiful room of the hotel, the room on the first floor, which overlooked the boulevard.","When Gervaise awoke about five o'clock, stiff and sore, she burst into wild sobs, for Lantier had not come in. For the first time he had slept out. She sat on the edge of the bed, half shrouded in the canopy of faded chintz that hung from the arrow fastened to the ceiling by a string. Slowly, with her eyes suffused with tears, she looked around this miserable chambre garnie, whose furniture consisted of a chestnut bureau of which one drawer was absent, three straw chairs and a greasy table on which was a broken-handled pitcher. Another bedstead—an iron one—had been brought in for the children. This stood in front of the bureau and filled up two thirds of the room. A trunk belonging to Gervaise and Lantier stood in the corner wide open, showing its empty sides, while at the bottom a man's old hat lay among soiled shirts and hose. Along the walls and on the backs of the chairs hung a ragged shawl, a pair of muddy pantaloons and a dress or two—all too bad for the old-clothes man to buy. In the middle of the mantel between two mismated tin candlesticks was a bundle of pawn tickets from the Mont-de-Piété. These tickets were of a delicate shade of rose. The room was the best in the hotel—the first floor looking out on the boulevard.","When, towards five o’clock, Gervaise awoke, stiff and sore, she broke forth into sobs. Lantier had not returned. For the first time he had slept away from home. She remained seated on the edge of the bed, under the strip of faded chintz, which hung from the rod fastened to the ceiling by a piece of string. And slowly, with her eyes veiled by tears, she glanced round the wretched lodging, furnished with a walnut chest of drawers, minus one drawer, three rush-bottomed chairs, and a little greasy table, on which stood a broken water-jug. There had been added, for the children, an iron bedstead, which prevented any one getting to the chest of drawers, and filled two-thirds of the room. Gervaise’s and Lantier’s trunk, wide open, in one corner, displayed its emptiness, and a man’s old hat right at the bottom almost buried beneath some dirty shirts and socks; whilst, against the walls, above the articles of furniture, hung a shawl full of holes, and a pair of trousers begrimed with mud, the last rags which the dealers in second-hand clothes declined to buy. In the centre of the mantel-piece, lying between two odd zinc candle-sticks, was a bundle of pink pawn-tickets. It was the best room of the hotel, the first floor room, looking on to the Boulevard."
"- Eh bien ! et moi ? reprit la grande veuve, les lèvres pincées. Vous êtes galant. Vous savez, je ne suis pas une chienne, je ne me mets pas les pattes en l'air, quand on siffle !","- Well ! and me ? resumed the tall widow, her lips pursed. You are gallant. You know, I'm not a female dog, I don't put my paws in the air when we whistle!","""I should make a florist of her,"" said Mme Lerat.","“Well, what about me?” objected Madame Lerat, pursing her lips. “You’re certainly not very polite. I assure you that I don’t lie down for anyone who whistles.” Then all the rest joined together in hushing her."
"Elle tourna, chercha une fois encore par terre ; et, ne trouvant que le petit baquet, elle le prit par les pieds, lança l'eau du bleu à la figure de Virginie.","She turned, looked once more on the ground; and, finding only the little tub, she took it by the feet, threw the blue water in Virginie's face.","She turned and mechanically looked around on the floor; seeing nothing, however, but the small tub of bluing water, she threw that in Virginie's face.","She turned round, looking once more about the ground; and only observing the little tub, she seized hold of it by the legs, and flung the whole of the bluing at Virginie’s face."
"Mais la jeune femme voulait s'en aller. Elle ne répondait pas aux apitoiements, à l'ovation bavarde des laveuses qui l'entouraient, droites dans leurs tabliers. Quand elle fut chargée, elle gagna la porte, où ses enfants l'attendaient.","But the young woman wanted to leave. She did not respond to the self-pity, to the garrulous ovation of the washerwomen who surrounded her, upright in their aprons. When she was loaded, she went to the door, where her children were waiting for her.",But Gervaise did not seem to hear her and paid no attention either to the women who crowded around her with congratulations. She hastened to the door where her children awaited her.,"But Gervaise wanted to go home. She made no reply to the pitying remarks and noisy ovation of the other women who surrounded her, erect in their aprons. When she was laden she gained the door, where the children awaited her."
"Tout le quartier sut bientôt que, chaque nuit, Gervaise allait retrouver Lantier. Madame Lorilleux, devant les voisines, avait une indignation bruyante ; elle plaignait son frère, ce jeanjean que sa femme peignait en jaune de la tête aux pieds ; et, à l'entendre, si elle entrait encore dans un pareil bazar, c'était uniquement pour sa pauvre mère, qui se trouvait forcée de vivre au milieu de ces abominations. Alors, le quartier tomba sur Gervaise. Ça devait être elle qui avait débauché le chapelier. On voyait ça dans ses yeux. Oui, malgré les vilains bruits, ce sacré sournois de Lantier restait gobé, parce qu'il continuait ses airs d'homme comme il faut avec tout le monde, marchant sur les trottoirs en lisant le journal, prévenant et galant auprès des dames, ayant toujours à donner des pastilles et des fleurs. Mon Dieu ! lui, faisait son métier de coq ; un homme est un homme, on ne peut pas lui demander de résister aux femmes qui se jettent à son cou. Mais elle, n'avait pas d'excuse ; elle déshonorait la rue de la Goutte-d'Or. Et les Lorilleux, comme parrain et marraine, attiraient Nana chez eux pour avoir des détails. Quand ils la questionnaient d'une façon détournée, la petite prenait son air bêta, répondait en éteignant la flamme de ses yeux sous ses longues paupières molles.","The whole neighborhood soon knew that every night Gervaise was going to find Lantier. Madame Lorilleux, in front of the neighbors, was noisily indignant; she felt sorry for her brother, that pair of jeans his wife painted yellow from head to foot; and, to hear her, if she again entered into such a mess, it was solely for her poor mother, who found herself forced to live in the midst of these abominations. Then the neighborhood fell on Gervaise. She must have been the one who poached the hatter. You could see it in his eyes. Yes, in spite of the ugly noises, that damned sly Lantier remained gobbled up, because he carried on his airs of a well-behaved man with everyone, walking on the sidewalks reading the newspaper, attentive and gallant with the ladies, having always giving lozenges and flowers. My God ! he was doing his job as a rooster; a man is a man, you can't ask him to resist the women who throw themselves on his neck. But she had no excuse; it dishonored the rue de la Goutte-d'Or. And the Lorilleuxs, as godfather and godmother, would lure Nana to their house to get details. When they questioned her in a roundabout way, the little one put on her foolish air, answered by extinguishing the flame in her eyes under her long soft eyelids.","All the neighborhood were soon informed of the condition of things by her two sisters-in-law, who declared they entered her doors only on their mother's account, who, poor thing, was compelled to live amid these abominations. Everyone accused Gervaise now of having perverted poor Lantier. "" Men will be men,"" they said; ""surely you can't expect them to turn a cold shoulder to women who throw themselves at their heads. She has no possible excuse; she is a disgrace to the whole street!"" The Lorilleuxs invited Nana to dinner that they might question her, but as soon as they began the child looked absolutely stupid, and they could extort nothing from her.","It wasn’t long until the entire neighborhood knew that Gervaise visited Lantier’s room every night. Madame Lorilleux was loudly indignant, calling her brother a poor fool whose wife had shamed him. And her poor mother, forced to live in the midst of such horrors. As a result, the neighbors blamed Gervaise. Yes, she must have led Lantier astray; you could see it in her eyes. In spite of the nasty gossip, Lantier was still liked because he was always so polite. He always had candy or flowers to give the ladies. Mon Dieu! Men shouldn’t be expected to push away women who threw themselves at them. There was no excuse for Gervaise. She was a disgrace. The Lorilleuxs used to bring Nana up to their apartment in order to find out more details from her, their godchild. But Nana would put on her expression of innocent stupidity and lower her long silky eyelashes to hide the fire in her eyes as she replied."
"- Dis donc, ma biche, j'y suis, je t'attends.","- Hey, honey, I'm here, I'm waiting for you.",Gervaise undressed her husband and tucked him up in bed as if he had been a child and then returned to her fluting irons in time to still a grand dispute that was going on about an iron that had not been properly cleaned.,"“I say, my lovely, I’m here, and waiting for you!”"
"Ses cris se perdaient dans un râle. Il ne marmottait plus que des mots sans suite, une écume à la bouche, le menton mouillé de salive. Le médecin se frottait le nez avec le doigt, un tic qui lui était sans doute habituel, en face des cas graves. Il se tourna vers l'interne, lui demanda à mi-voix :","His cries were lost in a rattle. He muttered nothing more than incoherent words, foaming at the mouth, his chin wet with saliva. The doctor was rubbing his nose with his finger, a habit that was no doubt usual for him in the face of serious cases. He turned to the intern, asked him in a low voice:",His shrieks ended in a convulsed murmur. He foamed at the mouth. The surgeon in chief turned to the assistant.,"His cries became lost in a rattle. He now only mumbled disconnected words, foaming at the mouth, his chin wet with saliva. The doctor rubbed his nose with his finger, a movement no doubt habitual with him in the presence of serious cases. He turned to the house surgeon, and asked him in a low voice:"
"D'un saut, Lantier se jeta à bas du lit. Ses yeux étaient devenus d'un noir d'encre dans son visage blême. Chez ce petit homme, la colère soufflait une tempête.","With a leap, Lantier threw himself out of bed. His eyes had turned inky black in his pale face. In this little man, anger was blowing a storm.","Lantier leaped from the bed. His eyes were as black as night and his face deadly pale. ""Yes,"" repeated his wife, ""","At a bound Lantier sprang from the bed. His eyes had become as black as ink in his pale face. With this little man, rage blew like a tempest."
"- Le même traitement, bouillon, lait, limonade citrique, extrait mou de quinquina en potion ? Ne le quittez pas, et faites-moi appeler.","- The same treatment, broth, milk, citric lemonade, soft extract of cinchona in potion? Don't leave him, and call me.","""Well, continue the same treatment—beef tea, milk, lemonade and quinine as directed. Do not leave him, and send for me if there is any change.""","“The same treatment, broth, milk, lemonade, and the potion of extract of quinine. Do not leave him, and call me if necessary.”"
"- Mais tout de suite, tout de suite ! ? Ah ! je serais joliment débarrassée !","- But immediately, immediately! ? Ah! I would be nicely rid!","""I am ready to leave it at once!"" cried Gervaise violently. ""I am sick and tired of it.""","“At once, at once! Ah! it’ll be a good riddance!”"
"Elle n'avait pas voulu retirer l'argent tout d'une fois. Elle le redemandait par cent francs, pour ne pas garder un si gros tas de pièces dans sa commode ; puis, elle espérait vaguement quelque miracle, un rétablissement brusque, qui leur permettrait de ne pas déplacer la somme entière. A chaque course à la Caisse d'épargne, quand elle rentrait, elle additionnait sur un bout de papier l'argent qu'ils avaient encore là-bas. C'était uniquement pour le bon ordre. Le trou avait beau se creuser dans la monnaie, elle tenait, de son air raisonnable, avec son tranquille sourire, les comptes de cette débâcle de leurs économies. N'était-il pas déjà une consolation d'employer si bien cet argent, de l'avoir eu sous la main, au moment de leur malheur ? Et, sans un regret, d'une main soigneuse, elle replaçait le livret derrière la pendule, sous le globe.","She hadn't wanted to withdraw the money all at once. She asked for it again for a hundred francs, so as not to keep such a large pile of coins in her chest of drawers; then, she vaguely hoped for some miracle, a sudden recovery, which would allow them not to displace the whole sum. Every time she went to the Caisse d'Epargne, when she came home, she added up on a piece of paper the money they still had there. It was only for good order. In vain the hole was dug in the currency, she kept, with her reasonable air, with her calm smile, the accounts of this debacle of their savings. Wasn't it already a consolation to use this money so well, to have had it at hand at the time of their misfortune? And, without a single regret, with a careful hand, she replaced the booklet behind the clock, under the globe.","She did not withdraw all her savings from the bank at once, for she had a vague hope that some miracle would intervene which would render the sacrifice unnecessary. Was it not a great comfort, she said to herself and to her enemies, for as such she had begun to regard the Lorilleuxs, that she had this money now to turn to in this emergency?","She had not been willing to withdraw the money all at once. She took it out a hundred francs at a time, so as not to keep such a pile of gold and silver in her drawer; then, too, she vaguely hoped for some miracle, some sudden recovery, which would enable them not to part with the entire sum. At each journey to the savings-bank, on her return home, she added up on a piece of paper the money they had still left there. It was merely for the sake of order. Their bank account might be getting smaller all the time, yet she went on with her quiet smile and common-sense attitude, keeping the account straight. It was a consolation to be able to use this money for such a good purpose, to have had it when faced with their misfortune."
"- Oui, oui, continua l'autre, je me suis aperçue de plusieurs petites choses ?","- Yes, yes, continued the other, I noticed several small things?","""Yes,"" continued the concierge, ""I have seen many little things.""","“Yes, yes,” continued the other, “I have noticed several little things—” But she suddenly interrupted herself, as Gervaise jumped up, with a pale face, and staring wildly at her."
Mais l'autre ricanait.,But the other chuckled.,But the other gave a knowing wink.,"But the other added, with a chuckle, “Right you are!"
"- Est-ce que ton amoureux est venu ? demandait-il parfois à Gervaise pour la taquiner. On ne l'aperçoit plus, il faudra que j'aille le chercher.","- Did your lover come? he sometimes asked Gervaise teasingly. We can't see him anymore, I'll have to go get him.","""Where is your lover?"" he said to his wife as he entered the shop. This was his favorite joke. ""I never see him nowadays and must hunt him up.""",“Has your lover been?” he would sometimes ask Gervaise by way of teasing her. “One never sees him now; I must go and rout him out.”
"Elle s'arrêta, comptant les pièces. Puis, elle s'écria :","She paused, counting the coins. Then she exclaimed:",She stopped talking—while she counted the pieces. Then she exclaimed:,She stopped whilst she counted the different articles. Then she exclaimed:
"Nana faisait la modeste, parce qu'elle trouvait ça gentil, ce jour-là. Elle continuait à regarder les cadeaux sur la commode, en affectant de baisser les yeux et de ne pas comprendre les vilains propos de son père. Mais le zingueur était joliment taquin, les soirs de ribote. Il lui parlait dans le cou.","Nana was being modest, because she thought it was nice that day. She continued to look at the presents on the chest of drawers, affecting to lower her eyes and not to understand her father's ugly remarks. But the zinc worker was nicely teasing on evenings of carousing. He spoke into her neck.","Gervaise answered impatiently, but Nana, who thought it better taste just then—all things considered—to receive with meekness all her father's abuse, dropped her eyes and did not reply.","Nana was being modest, because she thought it nice on such a day. She continued to look at the presents on the chest of drawers, affectedly lowering her eyelids and pretending not to understand her father’s naughty words. But the zinc-worker was an awful plague on the nights when he had had too much. Poking his face right against her neck, he said:"
- Le chapelier ! le chapelier ! hurlait Coupeau.,- The hatter! the hatter! yelled Coupeau.,"And he leaped at the wall, but the soft cushions threw him back.",“The hatter! The hatter!” yelled Coupeau.
"- Soyez bien sages, ne faites pas de bruit. Papa dort.","- Be good, don't make noise. Dad is sleeping.","""Be very good and keep quiet. Papa is sleeping.""","“Be very good, don’t make any noise; papa’s asleep.”"
- Est-ce qu'il va nous bassiner longtemps avec son travail ! cria Mes-Bottes.,- Is he going to bathe us for a long time with his work! cried My-Boots.,"Again he made a move to depart and go to his work when Lantier, with his dictatorial air, reminded him that he had not paid his score and that he could not go off in that way, even if it were to his duty. ""I am sick of the words 'work' and 'duty,'"" muttered Mes-Bottes.",“Is he going to badger us much longer about his work?” cried My-Boots.
"- Mon frère est bien libre, continua-t-elle d'un ton plus pincé. Sans doute, la famille aurait peut-être désiré ? On fait toujours des projets. Mais les choses tournent si drôlement ? Moi, d'abord, je ne veux pas me disputer. Il nous aurait amené la dernière des dernières, je lui aurais dit : Épouse-la et fiche-moi la paix ? Il n'était pourtant pas mal ici, avec nous. Il est assez gras, on voit bien qu'il ne jeûnait guère. Et toujours sa soupe chaude, juste à la minute ? Dis donc, Lorilleux, tu ne trouves pas que madame ressemble à Thérèse, tu sais bien, cette femme d'en face qui est morte de la poitrine ?","- My brother is very free, she continued in a more pinched tone. Undoubtedly, the family would perhaps have wished? We always make plans. But things turn out so funny? Me, first of all, I don't want to argue. He would have brought us the last of the last, I would have said to him: Marry her and leave me alone? He was not bad here, however, with us. He is quite fat, it is clear that he hardly ever fasted. And always his hot soup, just a minute away? Say, Lorilleux, don't you think Madame looks like Therese, you know, that woman opposite who died of a breast cancer?","""My brother is free to do as he pleases, of course,"" she continued. ""Of course his family would have liked— But then people always plan, and things turn out so different. Of course it is none of my business. Had he brought me the lowest of the low, I should have said, 'Marry her and let us live in peace!' He was very comfortable with us, nevertheless. He has considerable flesh on his bones and does not look as if he had been starved. His soup was always ready to the minute. Tell me, Lorilleux, don't you think that my brother's friend looks like Thérèse—you know whom I mean—that woman opposite, who died of consumption?""","“My brother is perfectly free,” she continued more stiffly. “No doubt the family might have wished—one always makes projects. But things take such funny turns. For myself, I don’t want to have any unpleasantness. Had he brought us the lowest of the low, I should merely have said: ‘Marry her and go to blazes!’ He was not badly off though, here with us. He’s fat enough; one can very well see he didn’t fast much; and he always found his soup hot right on time. I say, Lorilleux, don’t you think madame’s like Therese—you know who I mean, that woman who used to live opposite, and who died of consumption?”"
"- Eh bien ! voilà, finit-elle par avouer, la boutique du petit mercier, rue de la Goutte-d'Or, est à louer ? J'ai vu ça, il y a une heure, en allant acheter du fil. Ça m'a donné un coup.","- Well ! here, she ends up admitting, the little haberdasher's shop, rue de la Goutte-d'Or, is for rent? I saw this an hour ago, while going to buy yarn. It hit me.","""If you must know,"" she said, ""that little shop in La Rue de la Goutte-d'Or is vacant. I heard so only an hour ago, and it struck me all of a heap!""","But, as she had the table all wrong, standing still with the plates in her hands, absorbed in deep reflection, her husband insisted upon knowing what was the matter. “Well, it is this,” she ended by saying, “the little draper’s shop in the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or, is to let. I saw it only an hour ago, when going to buy some cotton. It gave me quite a turn.”"
"- Non, papa, je t'en prie, ne frappe pas ? Je te jure que tu aurais du chagrin ? Ne frappe pas.","- No, dad, please don't knock? I swear you would be sad? Don't knock.","""Do not strike me, Papa. I am sure you will be sorry if you do. Do not strike me!""","“Pray, papa, don’t—don’t strike me. I swear to you you will regret it. Don’t strike!”"
"Et elle le trouva au premier rang, regardant, les bras croisés. C'était un grand gaillard, à cou énorme. Il riait, il jouissait des morceaux de peau que les deux femmes montraient. La petite blonde était grasse comme une caille. Ça serait farce, si sa chemise se fendait.","And she found him in the front row, looking on, his arms crossed. He was a big fellow, with an enormous neck. He laughed, he enjoyed the pieces of skin that the two women showed. The little blonde was fat as a quail. It would be a joke if his shirt split.","Finally she discovered him, calmly looking on with his arms folded. He was a tall youth with a big neck. He was laughing and hugely enjoying the scene. It would be a capital joke, he thought, if the women tore each other's clothes to rags and if they should be compelled to finish their fight in a state of nudity.","And she found him in the front rank, looking on with his arms folded. He was a big fellow, with an enormous neck. He was laughing and enjoying the sight of the skin which the two women displayed. The little blonde was as fat as a quail. It would be fun if her chemise burst open."
"- Ça, c'est la bannière ! dit-elle en riant plus fort.",- That's the banner! she said laughing harder.,"""You need not make such a fuss, Clémence; it is only because these women are here, and—"" But he could say no more; Gervaise quietly laid one hand on his mouth and the other on his shoulder and pushed him toward his room.","“That’s the banter!” said she, laughing harder than ever."
"Et Gervaise fit encore une dizaine de pas, dans l'obscurité, prudemment. Elle buta, compta les trois marches. Mais, au fond du couloir, Coupeau venait de pousser une porte, sans frapper. Une vive clarté s'étala sur le carreau. Ils entrèrent.","And Gervaise took another ten paces cautiously in the dark. She stumbled, counted the three steps. But, at the end of the corridor, Coupeau had just pushed open a door without knocking. A bright light spread over the pane. They entered.","And Gervaise moved cautiously for ten paces or more. She counted the three steps, and then Coupeau pushed open a door without knocking. A bright light streamed forth. They went in.","And Gervaise carefully took another ten steps in the obscurity. She stumbled and then counted the three steps. But at the end of the passage Coupeau had opened a door, without knocking. A brilliant light spread over the tiled floor. They entered."
"- Tu ne sais pas ce que tu viens de faire, Gervaise ? Tu as eu tort, tu verras. Pendant un instant, les enfants sanglotèrent. Leur mère, restée ployée au bord du lit, les tenait dans une même étreinte ; et elle répétait cette phrase, à vingt reprises, d'une voix monotone :","- You don't know what you just did, Gervaise? You were wrong, you'll see. For a moment the children sobbed. Their mother, who remained bent over on the edge of the bed, held them in the same embrace; and she repeated this phrase, twenty times, in a monotonous voice:","""You do not know what you have done, Gervaise. You are wrong—as you will soon discover."" For a moment the voices of the children filled the room. Their mother, lying on their narrow couch, held them both in her arms and said over and over again in a monotonous voice:","“You don’t know what you’ve done, Gervaise. You’ve made a big mistake; you’ll see.” For an instant the children continued sobbing. Their mother, who remained bending over the bed, held them both in her embrace, and kept repeating the same words in a monotonous tone of voice."
- Regarde donc ! dit tout d'un coup Gervaise.,- Look! said Gervaise suddenly.,"""Look!"" said Gervaise suddenly.","“Look there,” said Gervaise suddenly."
"- Le paquet de madame Gaudron, dit-elle. Je ne veux plus la blanchir, je cherche un prétexte ? Non, je ne suis pas plus difficile qu'une autre, j'ai touché à du linge bien dégoûtant dans ma vie ; mais, vrai, celui-là, je ne peux pas. Ça me ferait jeter du cœur sur du carreau ? Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait donc, cette femme, pour mettre son linge dans un état pareil !","""Madame Gaudron's package,"" she said. I don't want to whitewash her anymore, am I looking for an excuse? No, I'm not more picky than anyone else, I've touched some very disgusting linen in my life; but, true, this one, I cannot. Would that make me throw my heart out? What is she doing, this woman, to put her clothes in such a state!",Gervaise was seated with these piles of soiled linen about her.,"“Madame Gaudron’s bundle?” said she. “I’ll no longer wash for her, I’ll find some excuse. No, I’m not more particular than another. I’ve handled some most disgusting linen in my time; but really, that lot I can’t stomach. What can the woman do to get her things into such a state?”"
"Avec ça, il pleuvait si fort, que j'avais de l'eau dans mes poches. Vrai, on y pêcherait encore une friture.","With that, it was raining so hard, that I had water in my pockets. True, we would still catch a fry there.","""I have been waiting for you until I am wet through and have a fishpond in each pocket.""","And with all that, it rained so hard that I got my pickets full of water. Honor bright, you might still catch enough fish in ’em for a meal.”"
"- Rien, merci. Je me suis trop fatigué hier. Je vais dormir un peu.",- Nothing thanks. I got too tired yesterday. I'm going to sleep a little.,"You do not owe me anything."" He staggered to his feet and stood leaning against the bed and looking at her.","“Nothing, thanks. I tired myself with too much work yesterday. I will rest a bit.”"
"Coupeau força Gervaise à se lever. Elle pouvait bien s'approcher, elle verrait. Le chaîniste consentit d'un grognement. Il enroulait le fil préparé par sa femme autour d'un mandrin, une baguette d'acier très mince. Puis, il donna un léger coup de scie, qui tout le long du mandrin coupa le fil, dont chaque tour forma un maillon. Ensuite, il souda. Les maillons étaient posés sur un gros morceau de charbon de bois. Il les mouillait d'une goutte de borax, prise dans le cul d'un verre cassé, à côté de lui ; et, rapidement, il les rougissait à la lampe, sous la flamme horizontale du chalumeau. Alors, quand il eut une centaine de maillons, il se remit une fois encore à son travail menu, appuyé au bord de la cheville, un bout de planchette que le frottement de ses mains avait poli. Il ployait la maille à la pince, la serrait d'un côté, l'introduisait dans la maille supérieure déjà en place, la rouvrait à l'aide d'une pointe ; cela avec une régularité continue, les mailles succédant aux mailles, si vivement, que la chaîne s'allongeait peu à peu sous les yeux de Gervaise, sans lui permettre de suivre et de bien comprendre.","Coupeau forced Gervaise to get up. She could come closer, she would see. The chain maker consented with a grunt. He wound the wire prepared by his wife around a mandrel, a very thin steel rod. Then he gave a light stroke of the saw, which all along the mandrel cut the wire, each turn of which formed a link. Then he welded. The links were laid on a large piece of charcoal. He moistened them with a drop of borax, taken from the bottom of a broken glass, beside him; and, rapidly, he reddened them by the lamp, under the horizontal flame of the torch. So, when he had a hundred links, he went back to his minute work once more, leaning on the edge of the ankle, a piece of board that the rubbing of his hands had polished. He bent the stitch with the pliers, squeezed it on one side, introduced it into the upper stitch already in place, reopened it with the help of a pick; and this with continuous regularity, link following link, so quickly that the chain lengthened little by little before Gervaise's eyes, without allowing her to follow and fully understand.","All this time Lorilleux was watching Gervaise stealthily, and after a violent fit of coughing he said with an air as if he were speaking to himself:","Coupeau urged Gervaise to get up. She might draw nearer and see. The chainmaker consented with a grunt. He wound the wire prepared by his wife round a mandrel, a very thin steel rod. Then he sawed gently, cutting the wire the whole length of the mandrel, each turn forming a link, which he soldered. The links were laid on a large piece of charcoal. He wetted them with a drop of borax, taken from the bottom of a broken glass beside him; and he made them red-hot at the lamp beneath the horizontal flame produced by the blow-pipe. Then, when he had soldered about a hundred links he returned once more to his minute work, propping his hands against the edge of the cheville, a small piece of board which the friction of his hands had polished. He bent each link almost double with the pliers, squeezed one end close, inserted it in the last link already in place and then, with the aid of a point opened out again the end he had squeezed; and he did this with a continuous regularity, the links joining each other so rapidly that the chain gradually grew beneath Gervaise’s gaze, without her being able to follow, or well understand how it was done."
"- En voilà un caprice ! continuait madame Boche, à voix plus basse. Jamais elle ne savonne une paire de manches ? Ah ! une fameuse fainéante, je vous en réponds ! Une couturière qui ne recoud pas seulement ses bottines ! C'est comme sa sœur, la brunisseuse, cette gredine d'Adèle, qui manque l'atelier deux jours sur trois ! Ça n'a ni père ni mère connus, ça vit d'on ne sait quoi, et si l'on voulait parler ? Qu'est-ce qu'elle frotte donc là ? Hein ? c'est un jupon ?

It has no known father or mother, it lives on who knows what, and if we wanted to talk? What is she rubbing there? Eh ? is it a petticoat? It's pretty disgusting, he must have seen clean ones, that petticoat!","""That is a new notion!"" muttered Mme Boche in a low voice. "" She was never known before to rub out even a pair of cuffs. She is a lazy creature, I do assure you. She never sews the buttons on her boots. She is just like her sister, that minx of an Adèle, who stays away from the shop two days out of three. What is she rubbing now? A skirt, is it? It is dirty enough, I am sure!""","“There’s a freak for you!” continued Madame Boche in a lower tone of voice. “She never does any laundry, not even a pair of cuffs. A seamstress who doesn’t even sew on a loose button! She’s just like her sister, the brass burnisher, that hussy Adele, who stays away from her job two days out of three. Nobody knows who their folks are or how they make a living. Though, if I wanted to talk . . . What on earth is she scrubbing there? A filthy petticoat. I’ll wager it’s seen some lovely sights, that petticoat!”"
"Il disparut dans la cuisine. Maman Coupeau, après avoir embrassé Gervaise, s'émerveillait de la grosseur de l'enfant. Les deux autres femmes avaient également appliqué de gros baisers sur les joues de l'accouchée. Et toutes trois, debout devant le lit, commentaient, en s'exclamant, les détails des couches, de drôles de couches, une dent à arracher, pas davantage. Madame Lerat examinait la petite partout, la déclarait bien conformée, ajoutait même, avec intention, que ça ferait une fameuse femme ; et, comme elle lui trouvait la tête trop pointue, elle la pétrissait légèrement, malgré ses cris, afin de l'arrondir. Madame Lorilleux lui arracha le bébé en se fâchant : ça suffisait pour donner tous les vices à une créature, de la tripoter ainsi, quand elle avait le crâne si tendre. Puis, elle chercha la ressemblance. On manqua se disputer. Lorilleux, qui allongeait le cou derrière les femmes, répétait que la petite n'avait rien de Coupeau ; un peu le nez peut-être, et encore ! C'était toute sa mère, avec des yeux d'ailleurs ; pour sûr, ces yeux-là ne venaient pas de la famille.","He disappeared into the kitchen. Maman Coupeau, after kissing Gervaise, marveled at the size of the child. The other two women had also applied big kisses on the cheeks of the mother. And all three of them, standing in front of the bed, commented, exclaiming, on the details of the diapers, funny diapers, a tooth to be pulled out, nothing more. Madame Lerat examined the little one everywhere, declared her to be in good shape, even added, intentionally, that she would make a famous woman; and, as she found his head too pointed, she kneaded it lightly, in spite of his cries, in order to round it. Madame Lorilleux snatched the baby from her, getting angry: it was enough to give a creature all the vices, to fiddle with her like that, when her head was so tender. Then she looked for the resemblance. We nearly argued. Lorilleux, who craned his neck behind the women, repeated that the little one had nothing of Coupeau about it; a little nose perhaps, and again! It was all his mother, with eyes from elsewhere; sure, those eyes didn't come from the family.","He disappeared into the kitchen, and the women discussed the size of the baby and whom it resembled. Meanwhile Coupeau was heard banging round in the kitchen, and his wife nervously called out to him and told him where the things were that he wanted, but her husband rose superior to all difficulties and soon appeared with the smoking coffeepot, and they all seated themselves around the table, except the nurse, who drank a cup standing and then departed; all was going well, and she was not needed.","He disappeared into the kitchen. Mother Coupeau after kissing Gervaise, became amazed at the child’s size. The two other women also kissed the invalid on her cheeks. And all three, standing before the bed, commented with divers exclamations on the details of the confinement—a most remarkable confinement, just like having a tooth pulled, nothing more. Madame Lerat examined the baby all over, declared she was well formed, even added that she could grow up into an attractive woman. Noticing that the head had been squeezed into a point on top, she kneaded it gently despite the infant’s cries, trying to round it a bit. Madame Lorilleux grabbed the baby from her; that could be enough to give the poor little thing all sorts of vicious tendencies, meddling with it like that while her skull was still soft. She then tried to figure out who the baby resembled. This almost led to a quarrel. Lorilleux, peering over the women’s shoulders, insisted that the little girl didn’t look the least bit like Coupeau. Well, maybe a little around the nose, nothing more. She was her mother all over again, with big eyes like hers."

"Il évitait de regarder Gervaise. Mais il attendait évidemment un mot de sa part pour accepter. Celle-ci était très contrariée de l'idée de son mari ; non pas que la pensée de voir Lantier demeurer chez eux la blessât ni l'inquiétât beaucoup ; mais elle se demandait où elle mettrait le linge sale. Cependant, le zingueur faisait valoir les avantages de l'arrangement. Le loyer de cinq cents francs avait toujours été un peu fort. Eh bien ! le camarade leur paierait la chambre toute meublée vingt francs par mois ; ce ne serait pas cher pour lui, et ça les aiderait au moment du terme. Il ajouta qu'il se chargeait de manigancer, sous leur lit, une grande caisse où tout le linge sale du quartier pourrait tenir. Alors, Gervaise hésita, parut consulter du regard maman Coupeau, que Lantier avait conquise depuis des mois, en lui apportant des boules de gomme pour son catarrhe.","He avoided looking at Gervaise. But he was obviously waiting for a word from her to accept. She was very upset about her husband's idea; not that the thought of seeing Lantier staying with them hurt her or worried her much; but she wondered where she would put the dirty laundry. However, the zinc worker argued the advantages of the arrangement. The rent of five hundred francs had always been a bit steep. Well ! the comrade would pay them twenty francs a month for the fully furnished room; it wouldn't be expensive for him, and it would help them at term. He added that he was in charge of scheming, under their bed, a big crate in which all the dirty laundry in the neighborhood could fit. Then Gervaise hesitated, seemed to consult Maman Coupeau, whom Lantier had won over months ago, by bringing her balls of gum for her catarrh.","He did not look at Gervaise as he spoke, but it was clear that he was only waiting for a word from her. She did not like the plan at all; not that the thought of Lantier living under their roof disturbed her, but she had no idea where she could put the linen as it came in to be washed and again when it was rough-dry. But Coupeau was enchanted with the plan. The rent, he said, had always been heavy to carry, and now they would gain twenty francs per month. It was not dear for him, and it would help them decidedly. He told his wife that she could have two great boxes made in which all the linen of the Quartier could be piled. Gervaise still hesitated, questioning Mamma Coupeau with her eyes. Lantier had long since propitiated the old lady by bringing her gumdrops for her cough.","He avoided looking at Gervaise. But he was evidently waiting for a word from her before accepting. She was very much annoyed at her husband ’s idea; not that the thought of seeing Lantier living with them wounded her feelings, or made her particularly uneasy, but she was wondering where she would be able to keep the dirty clothes. Coupeau was going on about the advantages of the arrangement. Their rent, five hundred francs, had always been a bit steep. Their friend could pay twenty francs a month for a nicely furnished room and it would help them with the rent. He would be responsible for fixing up a big box under their bed that would be large enough to hold all the dirty clothes. Gervaise still hesitated. She looked toward mother Coupeau for guidance. Lantier had won over mother Coupeau months ago by bringing her gum drops for her cough."
"Les dames, déjà assises, se levèrent d'un air inquiet et fâché. Madame Putois offrit de se retirer, parce que, selon elle, il ne fallait pas jouer avec ça ; d'ailleurs, elle ne toucherait à rien, les morceaux ne lui profiteraient pas. Quant à Boche, il ricanait : il aimait mieux être treize que quatorze ; les parts seraient plus grosses, voilà tout.","The ladies, already seated, got up looking worried and angry. Madame Putois offered to withdraw, because, in her opinion, we shouldn't play with that; besides, she wouldn't touch anything, the pieces wouldn't benefit her. As for Boche, he sneered: he preferred being thirteen to fourteen; the shares would be bigger, that's all.","The ladies, who were seated, started up. Mme Putois offered to leave because, she said, no one should fly in the face of Destiny; besides, she was not hungry. As to Boche, he laughed, and said it was all nonsense.","The ladies already seated rose up looking anxious and annoyed. Madame Putois offered to retire because according to her it was not a matter to laugh about; besides she would not touch a thing, the food would do her no good. As to Boche, he chuckled. He would sooner be thirteen than fourteen; the portions would be larger, that was all."
"Il était déjà sur le trottoir, lorsque le zingueur le rappela pour lui faire promettre de ne plus passer devant la porte sans leur dire un petit bonjour. Cependant, Gervaise, qui venait de disparaître doucement, rentra en poussant devant elle Etienne, en manches de chemise, la face déjà endormie. L'enfant souriait, se frottait les yeux. Mais quand il aperçut Lantier, il resta tremblant et gêné, coulant des regards inquiets du côté de sa mère et de Coupeau.","He was already on the sidewalk when the zinc worker called him back to make him promise not to walk past the door again without saying hello. However, Gervaise, who had just disappeared quietly, came in pushing Etienne in front of her, in his shirt sleeves, his face already sleepy. The child smiled, rubbed his eyes. But when he saw Lantier, he remained trembling and embarrassed, casting worried glances towards his mother and Coupeau.","He was at the door when Coupeau recalled him to say that he must never pass without coming in to say, ""How do you do?"" Meanwhile Gervaise, who had disappeared, returned, pushing Etienne before her. The boy was half asleep but smiled as he rubbed his eyes.

"La noce tourna à droite, descendit dans Paris par le faubourg Saint-Denis. Coupeau et Gervaise marchaient de nouveau en tête, courant, devançant les autres. M. Madinier donnait maintenant le bras à madame Lorilleux, maman Coupeau étant restée chez le marchand de vin, à cause de ses jambes. Puis venaient Lorilleux et madame Lerat, Boche et madame Fauconnier, Bibi-la-Grillade et mademoiselle Remanjou, enfin le ménage Gaudron. On était douze. Ça faisait encore une jolie queue sur le trottoir.","The wedding party turned to the right, descended into Paris by the Faubourg Saint-Denis. Coupeau and Gervaise again marched in front, running ahead of the others. M. Madinier now gave his arm to Madame Lorilleux, Mama Coupeau having stayed at the wine merchant's because of her legs. Then came Lorilleux and Madame Lerat, Boche and Madame Fauconnier, Bibi-la-Grillade and Mademoiselle Remanjou, finally the Gaudron household. We were twelve. There was still a pretty line on the sidewalk.","As the rain was still falling, they borrowed old umbrellas of every imaginable hue from the establishment and started forth for the Musée du Louvre. There were twelve of them, and they walked in couples, Mme Lorilleux with Madinier, to whom she grumbled all the way.","The wedding party turned to the right, and descended into Paris along the Faubourg Saint-Denis. Coupeau and Gervaise again took the lead, almost running and keeping a good distance in front of the others. Monsieur Madinier now gave his arm to Madame Lorilleux, mother Coupeau having remained behind in the wineshop on account of her old legs. Then came Lorilleux and Madame Lerat, Boche and Madame Fauconnier, Bibi-the-Smoker and Mademoiselle Remanjou, and finally the two Gaudrons. They were twelve and made a pretty long procession on the pavement."
"Il se montrait galant, se poussait contre la blanchisseuse, qui reprit son panier et le garda devant elle, afin de le tenir à distance. Goujet, contrarié, comprenant que le camarade blaguait, à cause de sa bonne amitié pour Gervaise, lui cria :","He showed himself to be gallant, pushed himself against the laundress, who took her basket and kept it in front of her, in order to keep him at a distance. Goujet, annoyed, realizing that the comrade was joking, because of his good friendship for Gervaise, shouted to him:","he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","He was becoming quite gallant, sidling up towards the laundress, who took hold of her basket and held it in front of her so as to keep him at a distance. Goujet, annoyed and seeing that his comrade was joking because of his friendship for Gervaise, called out to him:"
"- Non, bien sûr, je ne vous en veux pas ? L'affaire du lavoir, vous vous souvenez ?","- No, of course, I don't blame you? The laundry business, remember?","""Do you remember that day at the lavatory?""","She leaned toward Gervaise with a smile and added, “Really, I don’t hold any grudge against you for that business at the wash-house. You remember it, don’t you?”"
"Cependant, Mes-Bottes, qui regardait son jeu, donnait un coup de poing triomphant sur la table. Il faisait quatre-vingt-treize.","However, My-Boots, who watched his game, gave a triumphant punch on the table. It was ninety-three.","Then ensued a hot discussion and argument as to the probable motives for the murder. By this time the wine was exhausted, and they called for more.","Meanwhile, My-Boots, who had been looking at his hand, triumphantly banged his fist down on the table. He scored ninety-three."
"Son mari ayant réussi à la calmer, Coupeau s'approcha de Gervaise, toujours tranquille dans son coin, causant avec sa belle-mère et madame Fauconnier.","Her husband having succeeded in calming her, Coupeau approached Gervaise, still quiet in her corner, chatting with her mother-in-law and Madame Fauconnier.","Her husband having induced her to listen to reason, Coupeau went to Gervaise, who was calmly conversing with her mother-in-law and Mme Fauconnier.","Lorilleux finally succeeded in calming her down. Coupeau went over to Gervaise, who had been sitting quietly in a corner with mother Coupeau and Madame Fauconnier."
"Puis, elle se montra maternelle.","Then, she showed herself to be maternal.",Then in a maternal tone she added:,Then she became quite maternal.
"La noce descendit, muette, boudeuse, avec la seule dégringolade des souliers sur les marches. En bas, M. Madinier voulait payer. Mais Coupeau se récria, se hâta de mettre dans la main du gardien vingt-quatre sous, deux sous par personne. Il était près de cinq heures et demie ; on avait tout juste le temps de rentrer. Alors, on revint par les boulevards et par le faubourg Poissonnière. Coupeau, pourtant, trouvait que la promenade ne pouvait pas se terminer comme ça ; il poussa tout le monde au fond d'un marchand de vin, où l'on prit du vermouth.","The wedding party descended, mute, sulky, with only the slipping of shoes on the steps. Downstairs, M. Madinier wanted to pay. But Coupeau protested, hastened to put twenty-four sous in the hand of the keeper, two sous for each person. It was nearly half-past five; we just had time to get home. So they came back by the boulevards and by the Faubourg Poissonniere. Coupeau, however, felt that the walk could not end like this; he pushed everyone into the back of a wine-merchant, where they took vermouth.","Madinier again constituted himself master of ceremonies and pointed out all the monuments, but Mme Fauconnier would not put her foot outside the little door; she would not look down on that pavement for all the world, she said, and the party soon tired of this amusement and descended the stairs. At the foot Madinier wished to pay, but Coupeau interfered and put into the hand of the guard twenty-four sous-two for each person. It was now half-past five; they had just time to get to the restaurant, but Coupeau proposed a glass of vermouth first, and they entered a cabaret for that purpose.","The wedding party went down, unspeaking and sulky, awakening no other sound beyond that of shoes clanking on the stone steps. When it reached the bottom, Monsieur Madinier wished to pay; but Coupeau would not permit him, and hastened to place twenty-four sous into the keeper’s hand, two sous for each person. So they returned by the Boulevards and the Faubourg du Poissonniers. Coupeau, however, considered that their outing could not end like that. He bundled them all into a wineshop where they took some vermouth."
"Maman Coupeau et Gervaise parlèrent des Lorilleux, en mettant la table, dès trois heures. Elles avaient accroché de grands rideaux dans la vitrine ; mais, comme il faisait chaud, la porte restait ouverte, la rue entière passait devant la table. Les deux femmes ne posaient pas une carafe, une bouteille, une salière, sans chercher à y glisser une intention vexatoire pour les Lorilleux. Elles les avaient placés de manière à ce qu'ils pussent voir le développement superbe du couvert, et elles leur réservaient la belle vaisselle, sachant bien que les assiettes de porcelaine leur porteraient un coup.","Maman Coupeau and Gervaise talked about the Lorilleux, setting the table at three o'clock. They had hung large curtains in the window; but, as it was hot, the door remained open, the whole street passed in front of the table. The two women did not put down a carafe, a bottle, a salt shaker, without trying to slip into it an vexatious intention for the Lorilleuxs. They had placed them in such a way that they could see the superb development of the cutlery, and they reserved the fine crockery for them, knowing full well that the porcelain plates would deal them a blow.","Mamma Coupeau and Gervaise began to lay their table at three o'clock. They had hung curtains before the windows, but as the day was warm the door into the street was open. The two women did not put on a plate or salt spoon without the avowed intention of worrying the Lorilleuxs. They had given them seats where the table could be seen to the best advantage, and they placed before them the real china plates.","Mother Coupeau and Gervaise talked of the Lorilleuxs whilst they laid the cloth about three o’clock. They had hung some big curtains at the windows; but as it was very warm the door was left open and the whole street passed in front of the little table. The two women did not place a decanter, or a bottle, or a salt-cellar, without trying to arrange them in such a way as to annoy the Lorilleuxs. They had arranged their seats so as to give them a full view of the superbly laid cloth, and they had reserved the best crockery for them, well knowing that the porcelain plates would create a great effect."
"- Eh bien ! au revoir, dit Virginie. J'étais descendue chercher un quart de gruyère. Poisson doit croire que le froid m'a gelée en route.","- Well ! goodbye, said Virginie. I had gone downstairs to get a quarter of Gruyère. Fish must think the cold froze me on the way.","""Au revoir!"" said Virginie. ""I came out to buy a half pound of cheese. Poisson will think I am frozen to death!""","“Well, good-bye,” said Virginie. “I only came out for a quarter-pound of Swiss cheese. Poisson must think I’ve frozen to death on the way.”"
"- Dame ! il y a une petite opération auparavant ? Vous savez, couic !","- Lady ! there is a small operation before? You know, squeak!","""Take me! I want to go away!"" ""But there is a certain little operation first, you know—"" And he pretended to choke and rolled up his eyes.","“Ah! but there’s a little operation to be gone through beforehand—you know, glug!”"
"- Non, non, merci, répéta le chapelier. Vous êtes trop gentils, ce serait abuser.","- No, no, thank you, repeated the hatter. You are too kind, it would be abusing.","""You are too kind,"" remonstrated Lantier. ""I really feel that it would be an intrusion.""","“No, no, thanks,” repeated the hatter. “You’re too kind; it would be asking too much.”"
"- Monsieur Boche, vous allez boire un coup.","- Monsieur Boche, you're going to have a drink.","""You will join us, Monsieur Boche!""","“Monsieur Boche, you must have a drink.”"
"Poisson restait saisi, consterné ; et il ne trouvait pas un mot pour défendre l'empereur. C'était dans un livre, il ne pouvait pas dire non. Alors, Lantier lui poussant toujours l'image sous le nez d'un air goguenard, il laissa échapper ce cri, en arrondissant les bras :","Poisson stood stunned, dismayed; and he could not find a word to defend the Emperor. It was in a book, he couldn't say no. Then, Lantier still pushing the picture under his nose with a mocking air, he let out this cry, rounding his arms:","He found no words with which to defend the emperor. It was in a book—of course, therefore, it was true. Lantier, with a laugh of triumph, turned away and began to pile up his books and papers, grumbling a little that there were no shelves on which to put them.","Poisson was seized with consternation, and he could not find a word to say in the Emperor’s defense. It was in a book, so he could not deny it. Then, Lantier, continuing to push the picture under his nose in a jeering way, he extended his arms and exclaimed:"
Qu'un forban téméraire,Than a reckless pirate,"Mme Putois started up and began a fierce piratical song, standing stiff and erect in her black dress, her pale face surrounded by her black lace cap, and gesticulating violently.",“If the pirate audacious
"- Bien sûr, ce n'est pas vilain, Cadet-Cassis, déclara la jeune femme.","- Of course, it's not bad, Cadet-Cassis, declared the young woman.","""I do not think Cadet-Cassis so very bad,"" answered Gervaise, and she asked him about his work.","“Of course not. Young Cassis isn’t an ugly name,” observed the young woman."
"- Ça ne me va pas ? Je reste où j'ai affaire, entends-tu !","- It does not fit me ? I stay where I have business, do you hear!","""I am not going home; you need not think it!""",“I don’t like this. It’s my business where I go. Do you understand?”
"Gervaise se remit à tuyauter les dentelles du bonnet. Et, dans le calme brusque qui se fit, on distingua, au fond de l'arrière-boutique, la voix épaisse de Coupeau. Il restait bon enfant, il riait tout seul, en lâchant des bouts de phrase.","Gervaise went back to trimming the lace of the bonnet. And, in the sudden calm that fell, Coupeau's thick voice could be made out in the back of the shop. He remained good-natured, he laughed to himself, dropping bits of sentences.",Gervaise undressed her husband and tucked him up in bed as if he had been a child and then returned to her fluting irons in time to still a grand dispute that was going on about an iron that had not been properly cleaned. In the profound silence that followed her appearance she could hear her husband's thick voice:,"Gervaise continued with the lace of Madame Boche’s cap. In the sudden calm which ensued, one could hear Coupeau’s husky voice issuing from the depths of the bedroom. He was still jolly, and was laughing to himself as he uttered bits of phrases."
"A partir de cette époque, Virginie reparla souvent de Lantier à Gervaise. Elle semblait se plaire à l'occuper de son ancien amant, pour le plaisir de l'embarrasser, en faisant des suppositions. Un jour, elle dit l'avoir rencontré ; et, comme la blanchisseuse restait muette, elle n'ajouta rien, puis le lendemain seulement laissa entendre qu'il lui avait longuement parlé d'elle, avec beaucoup de tendresse. Gervaise était très troublée par ces conversations chuchotées à voix basse dans un angle de la boutique. Le nom de Lantier lui causait toujours une brûlure au creux de l'estomac, comme si cet homme eût laissé là, sous la peau, quelque chose de lui. Certes, elle se croyait bien solide, elle voulait vivre en honnête femme, parce que l'honnêteté est la moitié du bonheur. Aussi ne songeait-elle pas à Coupeau, dans cette affaire, n'ayant rien à se reprocher contre son mari, pas même en pensée. Elle songeait au forgeron, le cœur tout hésitant et malade. Il lui semblait que le retour du souvenir de Lantier en elle, cette lente possession dont elle était reprise, la rendait infidèle à Goujet, à leur amour inavoué, d'une douceur d'amitié. Elle vivait des journées tristes, lorsqu'elle se croyait coupable envers son bon ami. Elle aurait voulu n'avoir de l'affection que pour lui, en dehors de son ménage. Cela se passait très haut en elle, au-dessus de toutes les saletés, dont Virginie guettait le feu sur son visage.","From that time on, Virginie spoke often of Lantier to Gervaise. She seemed to enjoy occupying her former lover, for the sake of embarrassing him, making assumptions. One day, she says she met him; and, as the laundress remained silent, she added nothing, then only the next day let it be understood that he had spoken to her at length about her, with great tenderness. Gervaise was very disturbed by these whispered conversations in a low voice in a corner of the shop. The name of Lantier still caused a burning sensation in the pit of his stomach, as if this man had left something of himself there, under his skin. Certainly, she believed herself to be very solid, she wanted to live like an honest woman, because honesty is half of happiness. So she did not think of Coupeau in this affair, having nothing to reproach herself against her husband, not even in thought. She thought of the blacksmith, her heart hesitating and sick. It seemed to her that the return of the memory of Lantier within her, this slow possession of which she was regained, made her unfaithful to Goujet, to their unacknowledged love, with a sweetness of friendship. She lived sad days, when she thought she was guilty towards her good friend. She would have liked to have affection only for him, outside of her household. This was happening very high inside her, above all the filth, which Virginie watched for the fire on her face.","From this time Virginie often spoke to Gervaise of Lantier, and one day she said she had just met him. But as the clearstarcher made no reply Virginie then said no more. But on the next day she returned to the subject and told her that he had talked long and tenderly of her. Gervaise was much troubled by these whispered conversations in the corner of her shop. The name of Lantier made her faint and sick at heart. She believed herself to be an honest woman. She meant, in every way, to do right and to shun the wrong, because she felt that only in doing so could she be happy. She did not think much of Coupeau because she was conscious of no shortcomings toward him. But she thought of her friend at the forge, and it seemed to her that this return of her interest in Lantier, faint and undecided as it was, was an infidelity to Goujet and to that tender friendship which had become so very precious to her. Her heart was much troubled in these days. She dwelt on that time when her first lover left her.","Virginie now frequently spoke to Gervaise of Lantier. She seemed to find amusement in filling her mind with ideas of her old lover just for the pleasure of embarrassing her by making suggestions. One day she related that she had met him; then, as the laundress took no notice, she said nothing further, and it was only on the morrow that she added he had spoken about her for a long time, and with a great show of affection. Gervaise was much upset by these reports whispered in her ear in a corner of the shop. The mention of Lantier’s name always caused a worried sensation in the pit of her stomach. She certainly thought herself strong; she wished to lead the life of an industrious woman, because labor is the half of happiness. So she never considered Coupeau in this matter, having nothing to reproach herself with as regarded her husband, not even in her thoughts. But with a hesitating and suffering heart, she would think of the blacksmith. It seemed to her that the memory of Lantier—that slow possession which she was resuming—rendered her unfaithful to Goujet, to their unavowed love, sweet as friendship. She passed sad days whenever she felt herself guilty towards her good friend. She would have liked to have had no affection for anyone but him outside of her family. It was a feeling far above all carnal thoughts, for the signs of which upon her burning face Virginie was ever on the watch."
"Doucement, sans pousser un cri, glacée et prudente, la blanchisseuse revint dans la chambre de Lantier. Il s'était rendormi. Elle se pencha, en murmurant :","Slowly, without a cry, cold and cautious, the laundress returned to Lantier's room. He had fallen asleep again. She leaned over, murmuring:","Gervaise went to Lantier and waked him. ""She is dead,"" she said.","Gently, without uttering a cry, icy cold yet prudent, the laundress returned to Lantier’s room. He had gone to sleep again. She bent over him and murmured:"
"Dans la pièce du fond, les enfants dormaient. Ce louchon d'Augustine les avait terrorisés pendant tout le dessert, leur chipant leurs fraises, les intimidant par des menaces abominables. Maintenant, elle était très malade, accroupie sur un petit banc, la figure blanche, sans rien dire. La grosse Pauline avait laissé tomber sa tête contre l'épaule d'Etienne, endormi lui-même au bord de la table. Nana se trouvait assise sur la descente de lit, auprès de Victor, qu'elle tenait contre elle, un bras passé autour de son cou ; et, ensommeillée, les yeux fermés, elle répétait d'une voix faible et continue :","In the back room, the children were sleeping. That sleazy Augustine had been terrorizing them throughout the dessert, stealing their strawberries, intimidating them with abominable threats. Now she was very ill, squatting on a small bench, her face white, without saying anything. Fat Pauline had let her head fall against Etienne's shoulder, himself asleep on the edge of the table. Nana was sitting on the bedside rug, next to Victor, whom she held against her, one arm around his neck; and, drowsy, her eyes closed, she repeated in a weak and continuous voice:","The children had fallen asleep in the back room, Pauline with her head on Etienne's shoulder.","In the back-room the children had fallen asleep. That squint-eyed Augustine had tyrannized over them all during the dessert, pilfering their strawberries and frightening them with the most abominable threats. Now she felt very ill, and was bent double upon a stool, not uttering a word, her face ghastly pale. Fat Pauline had let her head fall against Etienne’s shoulder, and he himself was sleeping on the edge of the table. Nana was seated with Victor on the rug beside the bedstead, she had passed her arm round his neck and was drawing him towards her; and, succumbing to drowsiness and with her eyes shut, she kept repeating in a feeble voice:"
"- Monsieur, écoutez donc ?","- Sir, are you listening?","""Sir, please listen!""","“Sir, just listen.”"
"Et l'on dut rapporter Coupeau chez lui. Lorsque le brancard traversa la foule qui s'écrasait devant la boutique du pharmacien, les femmes du quartier parlaient de Gervaise avec animation : elle boitait, la mâtine, mais elle avait tout de même du chien ; bien sûr, elle sauverait son homme, tandis qu'à l'hôpital les médecins faisaient passer l'arme à gauche aux malades trop détériorés, histoire de ne pas se donner l'embêtement de les guérir. Madame Boche, après avoir emmené Nana chez elle, était revenue et racontait l'accident avec des détails interminables, toute secouée encore d'émotion.","And Coupeau had to be taken home. When the stretcher passed through the crowd that was crushing in front of the pharmacist's shop, the women of the neighborhood were talking animatedly about Gervaise: she was limping, the morning sickness, but she still had some trouble all the same; of course, she would save her man, while in the hospital the doctors would pass the weapon on to the left of the sick who had deteriorated too much, so as not to give themselves the trouble of curing them. Madame Boche, after taking Nana home, had come back and recounted the accident in endless detail, still shaken with emotion.","And Coupeau was carried home, and as the litter was borne through the Quartier the women crowded together and extolled Gervaise. She was a little lame, to be sure, but she was very energetic, and she would save her man. Mme Boche took Nana home and then went about among her friends to tell the story with interminable details.","And they had to take Coupeau to his own home. When the stretcher was carried through the crowd which was crushing up against the chemist’s shop, the women of the neighborhood were excitedly talking of Gervaise. She limped, the dolt, but all the same she had some pluck. She would be sure to save her old man; whilst at the hospital the doctors let the patients die who were very bad, so as not to have the bother of trying to cure them. Madame Boche, after taking Nana home with her, returned, and gave her account of the accident, with interminable details, and still feeling agitated with the emotion she had passed through."
"- Les fleuristes, murmura Lorilleux, toutes des Marie-couche-toi-là.","- The florists, murmured Lorilleux, all Marie-lie-toi-là.","""I should make a florist of her,"" said Mme Lerat.",“Flower-makers?” muttered Lorilleux. “Every one of them might as well walk the streets.”
"- Non, non, je ne veux pas, ça compromet la maison.","- No, no, I don't want to, it compromises the house.","""No, no, I will not. It would injure my house!""","“No, no, I won’t; it’ll compromise my establishment.”"
"Et Gervaise s'intéressait au tourniquet. Elle soiffait à tirelarigot, et appelait Mes-Bottes « mon fiston ». Derrière elle, la machine à soûler fonctionnait toujours, avec son murmure de ruisseau souterrain ; et elle désespérait de l'arrêter, de l'épuiser, prise contre elle d'une colère sombre, ayant des envies de sauter sur le grand alambic comme sur une bête, pour le taper à coups de talon et lui crever le ventre. Tout se brouillait, elle voyait la machine remuer, elle se sentait prise par ses pattes de cuivre, pendant que le ruisseau coulait maintenant au travers de son corps.","And Gervaise was interested in the turnstile. She was drastically thirsty, and called My-Boots ""my son."" Behind her, the drunk machine was still working, with its murmur of an underground stream; and she was in despair of stopping him, of wearing him out, seized with a dark anger against her, wanting to jump on the great still like on an animal, to kick him with her heels and burst his stomach. Everything was blurred, she saw the machine moving, she felt herself taken by its copper legs, while the stream was now flowing through her body.","Behind her the still was at work with constant drip-drip, and she felt a mad desire to grapple with it as with some dangerous beast and tear out its heart. She seemed to feel herself caught in those copper fangs and fancied that those coils of pipe were wound around her own body, slowly but surely crushing out her life.","Gervaise amused herself with the wheel of fortune. She was feeling awfully thirsty, and calling My-Boots “my child.” Behind her the machine for manufacturing drunkards continued working, with its murmur of an underground stream; and she despaired of ever stopping it, of exhausting it, filled with a sullen anger against it, feeling a longing to spring upon the big still as upon some animal, to kick it with her heels and stave in its belly. Then everything began to seem all mixed up. The machine seemed to be moving itself and she thought she was being grabbed by its copper claws, and that the underground stream was now flowing over her body."
"Cependant, elle hésita encore, ne sachant par où entrer. Une palissade crevée ouvrait un passage qui semblait s'enfoncer au milieu des plâtras d'un chantier de démolitions. Comme une mare d'eau bourbeuse barrait le chemin, on avait jeté deux planches en travers. Elle finit par se risquer sur les planches, tourna à gauche, se trouva perdue dans une étrange forêt de vieilles charrettes renversées les brancards en l'air, de masures en ruines dont les carcasses de poutres restaient debout. Au fond, trouant la nuit salie d'un reste de jour, un feu rouge luisait. Le bruit des marteaux avait cessé. Elle s'avançait prudemment, marchant vers la lueur, lorsqu'un ouvrier passa près d'elle, la figure noire de charbon, embroussaillée d'une barbe de bouc, avec un regard oblique de ses yeux pâles.","However, she still hesitated, not knowing where to enter. A broken palisade opened a passage that seemed to sink into the middle of the plaster of a demolition site. As a pool of muddy water blocked the way, two planks had been thrown across. She finally ventured onto the planks, turned left, found herself lost in a strange forest of old carts overturned with shafts in the air, of ruined hovels whose carcasses of beams remained standing. In the background, piercing the night soiled with the remnants of day, a red light shone. The sound of the hammers had ceased. She was advancing cautiously, walking towards the light, when a workman passed her, his face black as coal, bushy with a goatee's beard, with a sidelong gaze from his pale eyes.","She did not know where the entrance to the building was, but she caught a gleam of a red light in the distance; she walked toward it and was met by a workman.","She still hesitated, not knowing where to enter. A broken fence opened a passage which seemed to lead through the heaps of rubbish from some buildings recently pulled down. Two planks had been thrown across a large puddle of muddy water that barred the way. She ended by venturing along them, turned to the left and found herself lost in the depths of a strange forest of old carts, standing on end with their shafts in the air, and of hovels in ruins, the wood-work of which was still standing. Toward the back, stabbing through the half-light of sundown, a flame gleamed red. The clamor of the hammers had ceased. She was advancing carefully when a workman, his face blackened with coal-dust and wearing a goatee passed near her, casting a side-glance with his pale eyes."
"- Non, non, répondit Gervaise émue et souriante, je serais trop vieille. Allez, il vient un jour où l'on est content de partir.","- No, no, answered Gervaise moved and smiling, I would be too old. Come on, there comes a day when you're happy to leave.","""No, no,"" answered Gervaise with a smile that had a touch of sadness in it. ""I do not care to live to be very old. There comes a time when one is glad to go!""","“No, no,” replied Gervaise, deeply moved and smiling; “I shall be too old. Ah! a day comes when one’s glad to go.”"
"- Tiens ! madame Gervaise ! s'écria-t-il, la face épanouie ; quelle bonne surprise ! Mais, comme les camarades avaient de drôles de figures, il reprit en poussant Etienne vers sa mère :","- Take ! Madame Gervaise! he exclaimed, his face beaming; what a good surprise ! But, as the comrades had funny faces, he resumed, pushing Etienne towards his mother:","""Madame Gervaise!"" he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","“Why it’s Madame Gervaise!” he exclaimed with a bright look on his face. “What a pleasant surprise.” But as his comrades appeared to be rather amused, he pushed Etienne towards his mother and resumed:"
"- Maman ! maman ! cria tout à coup Nana, c'est Augustine qui met ses mains dans mon assiette !","- Mom ! mom ! cried Nana suddenly, it's Augustine who puts her hands on my plate!",In the next room at the children's table Nana was playing the mistress of the household.,"“Mamma! Mamma!” called out Nana suddenly, “Augustine’s putting her fingers in my plate!”"
"- Veux-tu te tenir tranquille ! cria Gervaise. Qu'est-ce que tu as donc dans le corps ? Nous allons boire de la boue, maintenant.",- Will you keep quiet! cried Gervaise. What do you have in your body? We're going to drink mud now.,"Mamma Coupeau brought in the coffee, and as each one of the women took a cup with a sigh of enjoyment the street door opened and Virginie came in with a rush of cold air.",“Leave it alone!” cried Gervaise. “Whatever is the matter with you? It’ll be like drinking mud now.”
"Coupeau les regarda, s'expliqua très carrément. Ils n'allaient pas faire les dindes, peut-être ! Le passé était le passé, n'est-ce pas ? Si on conservait de la rancune après des neuf ans et des dix ans, on finirait par ne plus voir personne. Non, non, il avait le cœur sur la main, lui ! D'abord, il savait à qui il avait affaire, à une brave femme et à un brave homme, à deux amis, quoi ! Il était tranquille, il connaissait leur honnêteté.","Coupeau looked at them, explained himself very frankly. They weren't going to play turkeys, maybe! The past was the past, wasn't it? If we held a grudge after nine years and ten years, we would end up not seeing anyone. No, no, he had his heart on his sleeve! First of all, he knew who he was dealing with, a brave woman and a brave man, two friends, what! He was calm, he knew their honesty.","Coupeau looked at them for a moment and then expressed his mind fully. They were no fools, he said, nor were they children. The past was the past. If people kept up their enmities for nine or ten years no one would have a soul to speak to soon. As for himself, he was made differently. He knew they were honest people, and he was sure he could trust them.","Coupeau looked at them and then spoke his mind very plainly. They were not going to behave like a couple of geese he hoped! The past was past was it not? If people nursed grudges for nine and ten years together one would end by no longer seeing anybody. No, no, he carried his heart in his hand, he did! First of all, he knew who he had to deal with, a worthy woman and a worthy man—in short two friends! He felt easy; he knew he could depend upon them."
"Madame Goujet cependant restait maternelle pour Gervaise. Elle la chapitrait parfois avec douceur, non pas à cause de son argent, mais parce qu'elle l'aimait et qu'elle craignait de lui voir faire le saut. Elle n'en parlait seulement pas, de son argent. Enfin, elle y mettait beaucoup de délicatesse.","Madame Goujet, however, remained maternal to Gervaise. Sometimes she chastised her gently, not because of her money, but because she loved him and was afraid of seeing him take the leap. She just didn't talk about it, about her money. Finally, she put a lot of delicacy into it.","Mme Goujet was always kind to Gervaise, not because of any fear of losing her money, but because she really loved her and was afraid of her going wrong in some way.","Madame Goujet felt a motherly concern for Gervaise and sometimes reprimanded her. This wasn’t due to the money owed but because she liked her and didn’t want to see her get into difficulties. She never mentioned the debt. In short, she behaved with the utmost delicacy."
"Le repas était commandé pour six heures. On attendait la noce depuis vingt minutes, au Moulin-d'Argent. Madame Boche, qui avait confié sa loge à une dame de la maison, causait avec maman Coupeau, dans le salon du premier, en face de la table servie ; et les deux gamins, Claude et Etienne, amenés par elle, jouaient à courir sous la table, au milieu d'une débandade de chaises. Lorsque Gervaise, en entrant, aperçut les petits, qu'elle n'avait pas vus de la journée, elle les prit sur ses genoux, les caressa, avec de gros baisers.","The meal was ordered for six o'clock. We had been waiting for the wedding for twenty minutes at the Moulin-d'Argent. Madame Boche, who had entrusted her box to a lady of the house, was chatting with Maman Coupeau, in the drawing-room on the first floor, opposite the table served; and the two urchins, Claude and Etienne, led by her, were playing at running under the table, in the midst of a swarm of chairs. When Gervaise, on entering, saw the little ones, whom she had not seen all day, she took them on her knees, caressed them, with big kisses.","It was now half-past five; they had just time to get to the restaurant, but Coupeau proposed a glass of vermouth first, and they entered a cabaret for that purpose. When they returned to the Moulin d'Argent they found Mme Boche with the two children, talking to Mamma Coupeau near the table, already spread and waiting. When Gervaise saw Claude and Etienne she took them both on her knees and kissed them lovingly.","The repast was ordered for six o’clock. At the Silver Windmill, they had been waiting for the wedding party for a good twenty minutes. Madame Boche, who had got a lady living in the same house to attend to her duties for the evening, was conversing with mother Coupeau in the first floor room, in front of the table, which was all laid out; and the two youngsters, Claude and Etienne, whom she had brought with her, were playing about beneath the table and amongst the chairs. When Gervaise, on entering caught sight of the little ones, whom she had not seen all the day, she took them on her knees, and caressed and kissed them."
"- Chameau, va ! cria la grande Virginie.","- Camel, go! cried the tall Virginia.","""You devil! Be off with you!"" cried Virginie, starting back.",“The virago!” yelled tall Virginie.
"Coupeau regardait toujours le carreau. Puis, il leva sa face ravagée, il eut un rire d'idiot, en bégayant :","Coupeau was still looking at the windowpane. Then, he raised his ravaged face, he laughed like an idiot, stammering:",Coupeau was looking down on the floor intently. He raised his head and said with an idiotic laugh:,"Coupeau was still staring at the window-pane. But suddenly he raised his ravaged face, and stammered with an idiotic laugh:"
"Puis, quand la jeune femme l'eut rejointe, à gauche, tout au bout, la concierge, qui frottait furieusement une chaussette, se mit à parler d'une façon continue, sans lâcher sa besogne.","Then, when the young woman had joined her, on the left, at the very end, the concierge, who was furiously rubbing a sock, began to talk in a continuous fashion, without letting go of her task.","This way, my dear,"" cried Mme Boche, and when the young woman had joined her at the very end where she stood, the concierge, without stopping her furious rubbing, began to talk in a steady fashion.","Then, when the young woman had joined her at the very end on the left, the concierge, who was furiously rubbing a dirty sock, began to talk incessantly, without leaving off her work."
"- Tu ne sais pas, reprit Coupeau, puisqu'il a eu la délicatesse de refuser dehors une consommation, tu vas nous payer la goutte ? Ah ! tu nous dois bien ça !","- You don't know, Coupeau went on, since he had the delicacy to refuse a drink outside, you're going to pay us the drop? Ah! you owe us that!","Oh no, it was not worth the trouble, but she was much agitated at seeing the two men together so soon again, and with trembling hands she knotted up her loosened hair. Her workwomen had been gone some time.","“You know,” resumed Coupeau, “as he was so polite as to decline a drink outside, you must treat us to one here. Ah! you certainly owe us that!”"
"Et les dames, tapant sur leur verre, reprirent en chœur, au milieu d'une gaieté formidable :","And the ladies, banging on their glasses, went on in chorus, in the midst of tremendous gaiety:","His song was one familiar to them all and even to the street, for the little crowd at the door joined in the chorus.","And the ladies, striking their glasses, repeated in chorus in the midst of a formidable gaiety:"
"- Nous y sommes, dit Lantier. Ce soir, débuts de mademoiselle Amanda, chanteuse de genre.","- We are there, said Lantier. Tonight, debut of Miss Amanda, genre singer.","""Here we are!"" said Lantier. "" Mademoiselle Amanda makes her debut tonight.""","“Here we are,” said Lantier. “To-night, first appearance of Mademoiselle Amanda, serio-comic.”"
"- Rien, bien sûr, répondit la blanchisseuse. Je n'ai pas dîné, moi.","- Nothing, of course, answered the laundress. I haven't had dinner.","""Nothing,"" answered his wife. ""You know I have had no dinner!""","“Nothing, of course,” replied the laundress. “I haven’t dined yet.”"
"- Ecoute donc, rapporte-moi du dessert, moi j'aime les gâteaux ? Et, si ton monsieur est bien nippé, demande-lui un vieux paletot, j'en ferai mon beurre.","- Listen, bring me some dessert, I like cakes? And, if your gentleman is well dressed, ask him for an old coat, I'll make my butter.","""Bring some dessert with you, for I love cake. And perhaps you can induce your friend to give me an old coat, for I swear it is cold tonight.""","Listen, bring me back some dessert. I like cakes! And if your gentleman is well dressed, ask him for an old overcoat. I could use one.”"
"- Oh ! ça, c'est du petit rivet, du vingt millimètres, disait-il pour répondre aux questions de Gervaise. On peut aller à ses trois cents par jour ? Mais il faut de l'habitude, parce que le bras se rouille vite ?","- Oh ! That's a small rivet, twenty millimeters, he said to answer Gervaise's questions. Can we go to his three cents a day? But it takes some getting used to, because the arm rusts quickly?","he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","“Oh! these are little rivets of twenty millimetres,” said he in reply to Gervaise’s questions. “A fellow can do his three hundred a day. But it requires practice, for one’s arm soon grows weary.”"
"Par terre, la lutte continuait. Tout d'un coup, Virginie se redressa sur les genoux. Elle venait de ramasser un battoir, elle le brandissait. Elle râlait, la voix changée :","On the ground, the struggle continued. Suddenly Virginie sat up on her knees. She had just picked up a paddle, she was brandishing it. She groaned, her voice changed:","she said over and over again. Both women lay on the ground. Suddenly Virginie struggled up to her knees. She had got possession of one of the beaters, which she brandished. Her voice was hoarse and low as she muttered:","The struggle on the ground continued. All on a sudden, Virginie raised herself up on her knees. She had just gotten hold of a beetle and held it on high. She had a rattle in her throat and in an altered voice, she exclaimed,"
"La vie recommença. Nana, après avoir dormi douze heures dans son ancien cabinet, se montra très gentille pendant une semaine. Elle s'était rafistolé une petite robe modeste, elle portait un bonnet dont elle nouait les brides sous son chignon. Même, prise d'un beau feu, elle déclara qu'elle voulait travailler chez elle ; on gagnait ce qu'on voulait chez soi, puis on n'entendait pas les saletés de l'atelier ; et elle chercha de l'ouvrage, elle s'installa sur une table avec ses outils, se levant à cinq heures, les premiers jours, pour rouler ses queues de violettes. Mais, quand elle en eut livré quelques grosses, elle s'étira les bras devant la besogne, les mains tordues de crampes, ayant perdu l'habitude des queues et suffoquant de rester enfermée, elle qui s'était donné un si joli courant d'air de six mois. Alors, le pot à colle sécha, les pétales et le papier vert attrapèrent des taches de graisse, le patron vint trois fois lui-même faire des scènes en réclamant ses fournitures perdues. Nana se traînait, empochait toujours des tatouilles de son père, s'empoignait avec sa mère matin et soir, des querelles où les deux femmes se jetaient à la tête des abominations. Ça ne pouvait pas durer ; le douzième jour, la garce fila, emportant pour tout bagage sa robe modeste à son derrière et son bonnichon sur l'oreille. Les Lorilleux, que le retour et le repentir de la petite laissaient pincés, faillirent s'étaler les quatre fers en l'air, tant ils crevèrent de rire. Deuxième représentation, éclipse second numéro, les demoiselles pour Saint-Lazare, en voiture ! Non, c'était trop comique. Nana avait un chic pour se tirer les pattes ! Ah bien ! si les Coupeau voulaient la garder maintenant, ils n'avaient plus qu'à lui coudre son affaire et à la mettre en cage !","Life began again. Nana, after having slept for twelve hours in her old study, was very nice for a week. She had patched up a modest little dress, she wore a cap whose straps she tied under her bun. Even, taken by a beautiful fire, she declared that she wanted to work at home; you earned what you wanted at home, then you couldn't hear the filth in the workshop; and she looked for work, she sat down on a table with her tools, getting up at five o'clock the first few days to roll up her stems of violets. But, when she had delivered a few large ones, she stretched out her arms before the task, her hands twisted with cramps, having lost the habit of tails and suffocating to remain shut in, she who had given herself such a lovely current of look six months old. Then, the glue pot dried, the petals and the green paper caught grease stains, the boss came three times himself to make a scene asking for his lost supplies. Nana dragged herself along, always pocketing tattoos from her father, quarreling with her mother morning and evening, quarrels in which the two women threw themselves at the heads of abominations. It couldn't last; on the twelfth day, the bitch slipped away, carrying only her modest dress at her behind and her bonnichon over her ear. The Lorilleuxs, whom the child's return and repentance had left pinched, almost fell to the ground with their four irons in the air, they were so bursting with laughter. Second performance, eclipse second number, the young ladies for Saint-Lazare, by car! No, it was too funny. Nana had a knack for pulling her legs! Ah well ! If the Coupeaus wanted to keep her now, all they had to do was sew her up and put her in a cage!","Nana's old life now began again, for after the girl had slept for twelve hours on a stretch, she was very gentle and sweet for a week. She wore a plain gown and a simple hat and declared she would like to work at home. She rose early and took a seat at her table by five o'clock the first morning and tried to roll her violet stems, but her fingers had lost their cunning in the six months in which they had been idle. Then the gluepot dried up; the petals and the paper were dusty and spotted; the mistress of the establishment came for her tools and materials and made more than one scene. Nana relapsed into utter indolence, quarreling with her mother from morning until night. Of course an end must come to this, so one fine evening the girl disappeared. The Lorilleuxs, who had been greatly amused by the repentance and return of their niece, now nearly died laughing. If she returned again they would advise the Coupeaus to put her in a cage like a canary.","The old life began again. After sleeping for twelve hours in her closet, Nana behaved very well for a week or so. She had patched herself a modest little dress, and wore a cap with the strings tied under her chignon. Seized indeed with remarkable fervor, she declared she would work at home, where one could earn what one liked without hearing any nasty work-room talk; and she procured some work and installed herself at a table, getting up at five o’clock in the morning on the first few days to roll her sprigs of violets. But when she had delivered a few gross, she stretched her arms and yawned over her work, with her hands cramped, for she had lost her knack of stem-rolling, and suffocated, shut up like this at home after allowing herself so much open air freedom during the last six months. Then the glue dried, the petals and the green paper got stained with grease, and the flower-dealer came three times in person to make a row and claim his spoiled materials. Nana idled along, constantly getting a hiding from her father, and wrangling with her mother morning and night—quarrels in which the two women flung horrible words at each other’s head. It couldn’t last; the twelfth day she took herself off, with no more luggage than her modest dress on her back and her cap perched over one ear. The Lorilleuxs, who had pursed their lips on hearing of her return and repentance, nearly died of laughter now. Second performance, eclipse number two, all aboard for the train for Saint-Lazare, the prison-hospital for streetwalkers! No, it was really too comical. Nana took herself off in such an amusing style. Well, if the Coupeaus wanted to keep her in the future, they must shut her up in a cage."
"- Ah ! c'est vous, grogna madame Lorilleux, sans lui dire seulement de s'asseoir. Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?","- Oh! it's you, growled Madame Lorilleux, without even telling him to sit down. What do you want ?","""Ah, it is you, is it?"" said Mme Lorilleux. ""What do you want?""","“Ah! it’s you,” growled Madame Lorilleux, without even asking her to sit down. “What do you want?”"
"- Vous aviez une excuse, continua-t-elle. On venait de vous faire une saleté, une abomination ? Oh ! je suis juste, allez ! Moi, j'aurais pris un couteau.","- You had an excuse, she continued. They had just made you a mess, an abomination? Oh ! I'm just, come on! I would have taken a knife.","""You had an excuse,"" Virginie added as she placed her cup on the table. ""You had been abominably treated. I should have killed someone.""","“You see,” Virginie went on, “you had an excuse. They played a really rotten, dirty trick on you. To be fair about it, if it had been me, I’d have taken a knife to her.”"
- Dans quel sens l'avez-vous vue ?,- How did you see it?,"""And where did you see her?""","“What do you mean, you saw her?”"
"Et la société se tourna vers le vieux, insistant, l'encourageant. Lui, engourdi, avec son masque immobile de peau tannée, regardait le monde, sans paraître comprendre. On lui demanda s'il connaissait Les Cinq Voyelles. Il baissa le menton ; il ne se rappelait plus ; toutes les chansons du bon temps se mêlaient dans sa caboche. Comme on se décidait à le laisser tranquille, il parut se souvenir, il bégaya d'une voix caverneuse :","And society turned to the old man, insisting, encouraging him. He, numb, with his motionless mask of tanned skin, looked at the world, without seeming to understand. He was asked if he knew The Five Vowels. He lowered his chin; he no longer remembered; all the songs of the good times were mingled in his noggin. As they decided to leave him alone, he seemed to remember, he stammered in a cavernous voice:",Virginie whispered to Gervaise:,"And everybody turned towards the old man, pressing him and encouraging him. He, in a state of torpor, with his immovable mask of tanned skin, looked at them without appearing to understand. They asked him if he knew the “Five Vowels.” He held down his head; he could not recollect it; all the songs of the good old days were mixed up in his head. As they made up their minds to leave him alone, he seemed to remember, and began to stutter in a cavernous voice:"
"- Es-tu bassin ! dit Gervaise sans se fâcher. Reste tranquille, nous avons fini.","- Are you basin! said Gervaise without getting angry. Calm down, we're done.","""Do take care,"" said Gervaise impatiently. ""You will get them all mixed again.""","“What a nuisance you are!” said Gervaise without getting angry. “Keep still, we’re nearly done now.”"
- Nom de Dieu ! dit-il d'une voix étouffée.,- For God Sake ! he said in a choked voice.,"""Good God!"" he said in a choked voice, and he fell; his body turned over twice and crashed into the middle of the street with the dull thud of a bundle of wet linen.","“Mon Dieu,” he cried in a choked voice."
"- Le pied m'a tourné, dit Gervaise, quand elle put parler.","- My foot has turned me, said Gervaise, when she could speak.","""I turned my foot,"" said Gervaise when she could speak.","“My ankle twisted,” said Gervaise as soon as she was able to speak."
- Ils ont de l'or chez eux ? demanda Gervaise.,- Do they have gold at home? asked Gervaise.,"""And have they gold in these rooms?"" asked Gervaise.",“They’ve got gold in their room?” asked Gervaise.
"Et elles restèrent au milieu des marches, elles causèrent, raccommodées du coup, sans avoir risqué une seule allusion au passé. Virginie, alors âgée de vingt-neuf ans, était devenue une femme superbe, découplée, la face un peu longue entre ses deux bandeaux d'un noir de jais. Elle raconta tout de suite son histoire pour se poser : elle était mariée maintenant, elle avait épousé au printemps un ancien ouvrier ébéniste qui sortait du service et qui sollicitait une place de sergent de ville, parce qu'une place, c'est plus sûr et plus comme il faut. Justement, elle venait d'acheter un maquereau pour lui.","And they remained in the middle of the steps, they chatted, instantly reconciled, without having risked a single allusion to the past. Virginie, then twenty-nine years old, had become a superb woman, decoupled, her face a little long between her two jet-black headbands. She told her story right away to settle down: she was married now, she had married in the spring a former cabinetmaker worker who had just left the service and who was applying for a job as a city sergeant, because a job is safer. and more as it should. She had just bought a mackerel for him.","And they stood and talked for a few minutes with not the smallest allusion, however, to the past. Virginie, then about twenty-nine, was really a magnificent-looking woman, head well set on her shoulders and a long, oval face crowned by bands of glossy black hair. She told her history in a few brief words. She was married. Had married the previous spring a cabinetmaker who had given up his trade and was hoping to obtain a position on the police force. She had just been out to buy this mackerel for him.","And they remained conversing together on the stairs, reconciled at once without having ventured on a single allusion to the past. Virginie, then twenty-nine years old, had become a superb woman of strapping proportions, her face, however, looking rather long between her two plaits of jet black hair. She at once began to relate her history just to show off. She had a husband now; she had married in the spring an ex-journeyman cabinetmaker, who recently left the army, and who had applied to be admitted into the police, because a post of that kind is more to be depended upon and more respectable. She had been out to buy the mackerel for him."

"Perdue dans la cohue du large trottoir, le long des petits platanes, Gervaise se sentait seule et abandonnée. Ces échappées d'avenues, tout là-bas, lui vidaient l'estomac davantage ; et dire que, parmi ce flot de monde, où il y avait pourtant des gens à leur aise, pas un chrétien ne devinait sa situation et ne lui glissait dix sous dans la main ! Oui, c'était trop grand, c'était trop beau, sa tête tournait et ses jambes s'en allaient, sous ce pan démesuré de ciel gris, tendu au-dessus d'un si vaste espace. Le crépuscule avait cette sale couleur jaune des crépuscules parisiens, une couleur qui donne envie de mourir tout de suite, tellement la vie des rues semble laide. L'heure devenait louche, les lointains se brouillaient d'une teinte boueuse. Gervaise, déjà lasse, tombait justement en plein dans la rentrée des ouvriers. A cette heure, les dames en chapeau, les messieurs bien mis habitant les maisons neuves, étaient noyés au milieu du peuple, des processions d'hommes et de femmes encore blêmes de l'air vicié des ateliers. Le boulevard Magenta et la rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière en lâchaient des bandes, essoufflées de la montée. Dans le roulement plus assourdi des omnibus et des fiacres, parmi les haquets, les tapissières, les fardiers, qui rentraient vides et au galop, un pullulement toujours croissant de blouses et de bourgerons couvrait la chaussée. Les commissionnaires revenaient, leurs crochets sur les épaules. Deux ouvriers, allongeant le pas, faisaient côte à côte de grandes enjambées, en parlant très fort, avec des gestes, sans se regarder ; d'autres, seuls, en paletot et en casquette, marchaient au bord du trottoir, le nez baissé ; d'autres venaient par cinq ou six, se suivant et n'échangeant pas une parole, les mains dans les poches, les yeux pâles. Quelques-uns gardaient leurs pipes éteintes entre les dents. Des maçons, dans un sapin, qu'ils avaient frété à quatre et sur lequel dansaient leurs auges, passaient en montrant leurs faces blanches aux portières. Des peintres balançaient leurs pots à couleur ; un zingueur rapportait une longue échelle, dont il manquait d'éborgner le monde ; tandis qu'un fontainier, attardé, avec sa boite sur le dos, jouait l'air du bon roi Dagobert dans sa petite trompette, un air de tristesse au fond du crépuscule navré. Ah ! la triste musique, qui semblait accompagner le piétinement du troupeau, les bêtes de somme se traînant, éreintées ! Encore une journée de finie ! Vrai, les journées étaient longues et recommençaient trop souvent. A peine le temps de s'emplir et de cuver son manger, il faisait déjà grand jour, il fallait reprendre son collier de misère. Les gaillards pourtant sifflaient, tapant des pieds, filant raides, le bec tourné vers la soupe.","Lost in the hustle and bustle of the wide sidewalk, along the little plane trees, Gervaise felt alone and abandoned. These glimpses of avenues, all over there, emptied his stomach even more; and to think that, among this flood of people, where there were nevertheless people at their ease, not a single Christian guessed his situation and slipped ten sous into his hand! Yes, it was too big, it was too beautiful, his head was spinning and his legs were going, under this huge expanse of gray sky stretched over such a vast space. The twilight had that dirty yellow color of the Parisian twilights, a color that makes you want to die right away, street life seems so ugly. The hour was becoming suspicious, the distances were blurred with a muddy tint. Gervaise, already tired, fell right in the middle of the workmen's return. At this hour, the ladies in hats, the well-dressed gentlemen living in the new houses, were drowned in the midst of the people, processions of men and women still pale from the stale air of the workshops. The boulevard Magenta and the rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere released bands of them, out of breath from the climb. Amidst the more muffled rumble of omnibuses and cabs, among the drays, the upholsterers, the wagons returning empty and at a gallop, an ever-increasing swarm of smocks and blouses covered the roadway. The messengers came back, their hooks on their shoulders. Two workmen, lengthening their steps, took long strides side by side, talking very loudly, with gestures, without looking at each other; others, alone, in overcoats and caps, walked along the edge of the sidewalk, their noses lowered; others came in groups of five or six, following each other and not exchanging a word, their hands in their pockets, their eyes pale. Some kept their extinguished pipes between their teeth. Masons, in a fir tree, which they had four of them tied up and on which their troughs danced, passed by, showing their white faces to the doors. Painters were swinging their paint cans; a zinc worker was bringing back a long ladder, from which he nearly blinded everyone; while a belated fountain man, with his box on his back, played the air of the good King Dagobert on his little trumpet, an air of sadness in the depths of the heartbroken twilight. Ah! the sad music which seemed to accompany the trampling of the herd, the beasts of burden dragging each other, exhausted! Another day over! True, the days were long and started again too often. Barely time to fill up and sleep off his food, it was already broad daylight, he had to take back his necklace of misery. The fellows, however, whistled, stamping their feet, spinning stiffly, their beaks turned towards the soup.","It seemed strange to Gervaise that among this crowd who elbowed her there was not one good Christian to divine her situation and slip some sous into her hand. Her head was dizzy, and her limbs would hardly bear her weight. At this hour ladies with hats and well-dressed gentlemen who lived in these fine new houses were mingled with the people—with the men and women whose faces were pale and sickly from the vitiated air of the workshops in which they passed their lives. Another day of toil was over, but the days came too often and were too long. One hardly had time to turn over in one's sleep when the everlasting grind began again. Gervaise went with the crowd.","Lost in the crowd on the broad footway, walking past the little plane trees, Gervaise felt alone and abandoned. The vistas of the avenues seemed to empty her stomach all the more. And to think that among this flood of people there were many in easy circumstances, and yet not a Christian who could guess her position, and slip a ten sous piece into her hand! Yes, it was too great and too beautiful; her head swam and her legs tottered under this broad expanse of grey sky stretched over so vast a space. The twilight had the dirty-yellowish tinge of Parisian evenings, a tint that gives you a longing to die at once, so ugly does street life seem. The horizon was growing indistinct, assuming a mud-colored tinge as it were. Gervaise, who was already weary, met all the workpeople returning home. At this hour of the day the ladies in bonnets and the well-dressed gentlemen living in the new houses mingled with the people, with the files of men and women still pale from inhaling the tainted atmosphere of workshops and workrooms. From the Boulevard Magenta and the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere, came bands of people, rendered breathless by their uphill walk. As the omnivans and the cabs rolled by less noiselessly among the vans and trucks returning home empty at a gallop, an ever-increasing swarm of blouses and blue vests covered the pavement. Commissionaires returned with their crotchets on their backs. Two workmen took long strides side by side, talking to each other in loud voices, with any amount of gesticulation, but without looking at one another; others who were alone in overcoats and caps walked along the curbstones with lowered noses; others again came in parties of five or six, following each other, with pale eyes and their hands in their pockets and not exchanging a word. Some still had their pipes, which had gone out between their teeth. Four masons poked their white faces out of the windows of a cab which they had hired between them, and on the roof of which their mortar-troughs rocked to and fro. House-painters were swinging their pots; a zinc-worker was returning laden with a long ladder, with which he almost poked people’s eyes out; whilst a belated plumber, with his box on his back, played the tune of “The Good King Dagobert” on his little trumpet. Ah! the sad music, a fitting accompaniment to the tread of the flock, the tread of the weary beasts of burden."
- Est-ce qu'il y avait une dame dans la voiture ?,- Was there a lady in the car?,"""Was there a lady in the carriage?"" she asked.",Was there a lady in the cab?”
"- Les ouvriers ne sont pas des soldats, déclara-t-il. Les Invalides sont pour les soldats ? Il ne faut pas demander des choses impossibles.","- Workers are not soldiers, he declared. Les Invalides are for soldiers? Don't ask for impossible things.","""But workmen are not soldiers,"" interrupted Poisson, who considered it his duty to espouse the cause of the government. ""It is foolish to expect them to do impossibilities.""","“Workmen are not soldiers,” declared he. “The Invalides is for soldiers. You must not ask for what is impossible.”"

"C'était rue de la Charbonnière, à l'angle de la rue de Chartres, un fichu carrefour dans lequel le vent jouait aux quatre coins. Nom d'un chien ! il ne faisait pas chaud, à arpenter le pavé. Encore si l'on avait eu des fourrures ! Le ciel restait d'une vilaine couleur de plomb, et la neige, amassée là-haut, coiffait le quartier d'une calotte de glace. Rien ne tombait, mais il y avait un gros silence en l'air, qui apprêtait pour Paris un déguisement complet, une jolie robe de bal, blanche et neuve. Gervaise levait le nez, en priant le bon Dieu de ne pas lâcher sa mousseline tout de suite. Elle tapait des pieds, regardait une boutique d'épicier, en face, puis tournait les talons, parce que c'était inutile de se donner trop faim à l'avance. Le carrefour n'offrait pas de distractions. Les quelques passants filaient raide, entortillés dans des cache-nez ; car, naturellement, on ne flâne pas, quand le froid vous serre les fesses. Cependant, Gervaise aperçut quatre ou cinq femmes qui montaient la garde comme elle, à la porte du maître zingueur ; encore des malheureuses, bien sûr, des épouses guettant la paie, pour l'empêcher de s'envoler chez le marchand de vin. Il y avait une grande haridelle, une figure de gendarme, collée contre le mur, prête à sauter sur le dos de son homme. Une petite, toute noire, l'air humble et délicat, se promenait de l'autre côté de la chaussée. Une autre, empotée, avait amené ses deux mioches, qu'elle traînait à droite et à gauche, grelottant et pleurant. Et toutes, Gervaise comme ses camarades de faction, passaient et repassaient, en se jetant des coups d'œil obliques, sans se parler. Une agréable rencontre, ah ! oui, je t'en fiche ! Elles n'avaient pas besoin de lier connaissance, pour connaître leur numéro. Elles logeaient toutes à la même enseigne, chez misère et compagnie. Ça donnait plus froid encore, de les voir piétiner et se croiser silencieusement, dans cette terrible température de janvier.","It was rue de la Charbonniere, at the corner of rue de Chartres, a bloody crossroads in which the wind was playing at all four corners. Name of a dog ! it was not hot, pacing the pavement. Even if we had had furs! The sky remained an ugly leaden color, and the snow, piled up there, capped the neighborhood with a cap of ice. Nothing fell, but there was a great silence in the air, which prepared for Paris a complete disguise, a pretty ball gown, white and new. Gervaise looked up, praying God not to let go of her muslin right away. She stamped her feet, looked at a grocer's shop opposite, then turned on her heels, because there was no point in making herself too hungry in advance. The crossroads offered no distractions. The few passers-by sped along, wrapped in mufflers; because, of course, you don't stroll around when the cold grips your buttocks. However, Gervaise saw four or five women who were mounting guard like her, at the door of the master zinc-worker; more unhappy ones, of course, wives watching for their pay to prevent it from flying off to the wine merchant. There was a tall haridelle, a policeman's face, glued against the wall, ready to jump on the back of her man. A little girl, all black, with a humble and delicate air, was walking on the other side of the road. Another, clumsy, had brought her two brats, dragging them to right and left, shivering and crying. And all of them, Gervaise like her comrades on duty, passed and repassed, glancing sideways at each other, without speaking. A pleasant meeting, ah! yes, I don't care! They didn't need to get to know each other to find out their number. They all lived in the same boat, at misery and company. It was even colder to see them tramping and crossing silently, in this terrible January temperature.","It was a very cold corner where she stood. The sounds of the carriages and footsteps were strangely muffled by reason of the fast-falling snow. Gervaise stamped her feet to keep them from freezing. The people who passed offered few distractions, for they hurried by with their coat collars turned up to their ears. But Gervaise saw several women watching the door of the factory quite as anxiously as herself—they were wives who, like herself, probably wished to get hold of a portion of their husbands' wages. She did not know them, but it required no introduction to understand their business. The door of the factory remained firmly shut for some time. Then it opened to allow the egress of one workman; then two, three, followed, but these were probably those who, well behaved, took their wages home to their wives, for they neither retreated nor started when they saw the little crowd.","She was at the corner of Rue de la Charbonniere and Rue de Chartres. A chill wind was blowing and the sky was an ugly leaden grey. The impending snow hung over the city but not a flake had fallen as yet. She tried stamping her feet to keep warm, but soon stopped as there was no use working up an appetite. There was nothing amusing about. The few passers-by strode rapidly along, wrapped up in comforters; naturally enough one does not care to tarry when the cold is nipping at your heels. However, Gervaise perceived four or five women who were mounting guard like herself outside the door of the zinc-works; unfortunate creatures of course—wives watching for the pay to prevent it going to the dram-shop. There was a tall creature as bulky as a gendarme leaning against the wall, ready to spring on her husband as soon as he showed himself. A dark little woman with a delicate humble air was walking about on the other side of the way. Another one, a fat creature, had brought her two brats with her and was dragging them along, one on either hand, and both of them shivering and sobbing. And all these women, Gervaise like the others, passed and repassed, exchanging glances, but without speaking to one another. A pleasant meeting and no mistake. They didn’t need to make friends to learn what number they lived at. They could all hang out the same sideboard, “Misery & Co.” It seemed to make one feel even colder to see them walk about in silence, passing each other in this terrible January weather."
"- Eh bien ! bonsoir, renvoyez-moi mon linge, nous compterons plus tard.","- Well ! good evening, send me back my laundry, we will count later.","""Remember, I want my linen at once, and when that is all sent back to me we will settle the account.""",“Well! Good-night; send me back my things and we will settle up afterwards.”
"L'enclume avait une sonnerie argentine. Lui, sans une goutte de sueur, très à l'aise, tapait d'un air bonhomme, sans paraître faire plus d'effort que les soirs où il découpait des images, chez lui.","The anvil had a silvery ringtone. He, without a drop of sweat, very comfortable, typed with a good-natured air, without seeming to make any more effort than on the evenings when he cut out pictures at home.","he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","The anvil had a silvery ring. Without a drop of perspiration, quite at his ease, he struck in a good-natured sort of a way, not appearing to exert himself more than on the evenings when he cut out pictures at home."
"- Oui, c'est moi ! dit Gervaise. Ça vous étonne, parce que nous sommes à couteaux tirés ? Mais je ne viens pas pour moi ni pour vous, vous pensez bien ? C'est pour maman Coupeau que je viens. Oui, je viens voir si nous la laisserons attendre un morceau de pain de la charité des autres.","- Yes it's me ! said Gervaise. Does that surprise you, because we are at loggerheads? But I'm not coming for me or for you, you think right? It is for Mama Coupeau that I come. Yes, I'm coming to see if we'll let her wait for a piece of bread from others' charity.","""I have come,"" cried Gervaise, ""and I dare say you wish to know why, particularly as we are at daggers drawn. Well then, I have come on Mamma Coupeau's account. I have come to ask if we are to allow her to beg her bread from door to door—""","“Yes, it’s I!” said Gervaise. “I daresay you’re surprised to see me as we’re at daggers drawn. But I’ve come neither for you nor myself you may be quite sure. It’s for mother Coupeau that I’ve come. Yes, I have come to see if we’re going to let her beg her bread from the charity of others.”"
"- Ça se comprend, puisque je ne suis bon à rien. Ils ont raison, je ferais comme eux ? Voyez-vous, le malheur, c'est que je ne sois pas mort. Oui, c'est ma faute. On doit se coucher et crever, quand on ne peut plus travailler.","- It's understandable, since I'm good for nothing. They are right, I would do like them? You see, the misfortune is that I am not dead. Yes, it's my fault. We have to lie down and die, when we can no longer work.","He looked down at his poor stiff hands and added, ""I know I am good for nothing. I wish I was by the side of my boys. It is a great pity that one can't kill one's self when one begins to grow old.""","“It’s easy to understand, I’m no longer good for anything. They’re right; were I in their place I should do the same. You see, the misfortune is that I’m not dead. Yes, it’s my fault. One should lie down and croak when one’s no longer able to work.”"
"Un rire courut. Virginie, voyant son succès, s'approcha de deux pas, redressant sa haute taille, criant plus fort :","A laugh ran. Virginie, seeing her success, approached two steps, straightening her tall figure, shouting louder:","The women laughed, and big Virginie, elated at her success, went on in a louder and more triumphant tone:","The lookers-on burst out laughing. Virginie, seeing her success, advanced a couple of steps, drawing herself up to her full height, and yelling louder than ever:"
"Quand ils furent enfin partis, Coupeau mit sa chaise tout contre le lit, et acheva sa pipe, en tenant dans la sienne la main de Gervaise. Il fumait lentement, lâchant des phrases entre deux bouffées, très ému.","When they had finally left, Coupeau leaned his chair close to the bed and finished his pipe, holding Gervaise's hand in his. He smoked slowly, dropping sentences between two puffs, very moved.",When Coupeau was alone with his wife he took her hand and held it while he finished his pipe.,"When they had at length gone off, Coupeau drew his chair close up to the bed and finished his pipe, holding Gervaise’s hand in his. He smoked slowly, deeply affected and uttering sentences between the puffs."
"- Pourquoi ? pourquoi ? bégayait-il ? Parbleu ! tu vas dire partout que tu m'entretiens, que tu laves, que tu raccommodes. Eh bien ! ça m'embête, là ! Fais tes affaires, je ferai les miennes ? Les blanchisseuses ne travaillent pas pour les chiens.","- Why ? Why ? was he stuttering? Parbleu! you're going to say everywhere that you maintain me, that you wash, that you mend. Well ! It bothers me there! Do your business, I'll do mine? Laundresses don't work for dogs.","Why? Why? Because,"" he said, ""I am sick of hearing you say that you wash and mend for me. Attend to your own affairs, and I will attend to mine.""","He hesitated for an instant, embarrassed by the piercing glance she fixed upon him. “Why—why—” stammered he, “because you go and tell everyone that you keep me, that you wash and mend. Well! It worries me, there! Attend to your own business and I’ll attend to mine, washerwomen don’t work for dogs.”"
"Les laveuses s'étaient rapprochées. Il se formait deux camps : les unes excitaient les deux femmes comme des chiennes qui se battent ; les autres, plus nerveuses, toutes tremblantes, tournaient la tête, en avaient assez, répétaient qu'elles en seraient malades, bien sûr. Et une bataille générale faillit avoir lieu ; on se traitait de sans-cœur, de propre à rien ; des bras nus se tendaient ; trois gifles retentirent.","The washers had moved closer. Two camps formed: one excited the two women like female dogs fighting; the others, more nervous, all trembling, turned their heads, had had enough, repeated that they would be sick of it, of course. And a general battle almost took place; they called each other heartless, fit for nothing; naked arms stretched out; three slaps rang out.","The women gathered around the combatants; the spectators were divided into two parties—some exciting and encouraging Gervaise and Virginie as if they had been dogs fighting, while others, more timid, trembled, turned away their heads and said they were faint and sick. A general battle threatened to take place, such was the excitement.",The other women had drawn nearer. They formed themselves into two camps. Some were cheering the combatants on as the others were trembling and turning their heads away saying that it was making them sick. A large fight nearly broke out between the two camps as the women called each other names and brandished their fists threateningly. Three loud slaps rang out.
"- Ah ! les garces ! La mère et la fille, ça fait la paire. Et c'est du propre d'aller manger le bon Dieu en guignant les hommes. Ose donc dire le contraire, petite salope ! ? Je vas t'habiller avec un sac, nous verrons si ça te grattera la peau. Oui, avec un sac, pour vous dégoûter, toi et tes curés. Est-ce que j'ai besoin qu'on te donne du vice ? ? Nom de Dieu ! voulez-vous m'écouter, toutes les deux !","- Oh! bitches! Mother and daughter make a pair. And it's clean to eat the good Lord while peeking at men. So dare to say the opposite, little slut! ? I'll dress you in a bag, we'll see if it scratches your skin. Yes, with a bag, to disgust you and your priests. Do I need you to be given vice? ? For God Sake ! will you two listen to me?","""Mother and daughter,"" he cried, ""a nice pair they make. I understand very well what all this row is for: it is merely to show yourself in a new gown. I will put you in a bag and tie it close round your throat, and you will see if the cure likes that!""","“Ah! the viragos! The mother and daughter, they make the pair. It’s a nice thing to go to church just to leer at the men. Dare to say it isn’t true, little slattern! I’ll dress you in a sack, just to disgust you, you and your priests. I don’t want you to be taught anything worse than you know already. Mon Dieu! Just listen to me, both of you!”"
"Le soir, Gervaise avouait franchement en riant qu'elle en serait tombée malade, si on l'avait empêchée d'avoir la boutique. Toutefois, avant de dire : C'est fait ! elle voulait emmener Coupeau voir les lieux et tâcher d'obtenir une diminution sur le loyer.","That evening, Gervaise frankly confessed with a laugh that she would have fallen ill if they had prevented her from having the shop. However, before saying: It's done! she wanted to take Coupeau to see the premises and try to obtain a reduction in the rent.","That night Gervaise told her husband that if he had thrown any obstacles in the way of her taking the shop she believed she should have fallen sick and died, so great was her longing. But before they came to any decision they must see if a diminution of the rent could be obtained.","That evening Gervaise frankly owned with a laugh that she would have fallen ill if she had been prevented from having the shop. Nevertheless, before saying “it’s done!” she wished to take Coupeau to see the place, and try and obtain a reduction in the rent."
"- Fichue bête ! dit-il enfin, tu peux bien t'asseoir une minute. On est mieux là qu'à barboter dehors ? Eh bien ! oui, je ne suis pas rentré, j'ai eu des affaires. Quand tu feras ton nez, ça n'avancera à rien ? Reculez-vous donc, vous autres.","- Damn beast! he said finally, you can sit down for a minute. Are we better off here than splashing around outside? Well ! yes, I did not return, I had business. When you do your nose, will it make any progress? Step back then, you people.","Gervaise saw she could not stand there among all those men, so she accepted the offered chair.","“You great noodle!” said he at length, “you can surely sit down a minute. You’re better here than splashing about outside. Well, yes; I didn’t come home as I promised, I had business to attend to. Though you may pull a long face, it won’t alter matters. Make room, you others.”"
"- Ah ! la saleté d'homme ! cria-t-elle. Voulez-vous bien la laisser, brigand ! Je vais vous dénoncer à la police, moi !","- Oh! man filth! she cried. Will you leave her, brigand! I'm going to report you to the police!","""Let her be!"" she cried. ""I will go myself and summon the police.""","“Ah! you brute of a man!” cried she. “Leave her alone, you brigand! I’ll put the police on to you.”"
"- Nom de Dieu ! oui, je lui en prêterai, hurla Mes-Bottes. Tiens ! Bibi, jette-lui sa monnaie à travers la gueule, à ce vendu !","- For God Sake ! yes, I'll lend him some, yelled My-Boots. Take ! Bibi, throw his change through his mouth, sold out!","Put it down!""","“Mon Dieu! Yes, I’ll lend him some,” yelled My-Boots. “Here! Bibi, throw this money in his face, the limb of Satan!”"
"Gervaise ne pouvait pleurer. Elle étouffait, les reins appuyés contre son baquet, le visage toujours entre les mains. De courts frissons la secouaient. Par moments, un long soupir passait, tandis qu'elle s'enfonçait davantage les poings sur les yeux, comme pour s'anéantir dans le noir de son abandon. C'était un trou de ténèbres au fond duquel il lui semblait tomber.","Gervaise could not cry. She was suffocating, her loins leaning against her tub, her face still between her hands. Short shivers shook her. From time to time, a long sigh passed, while she dug her fists deeper into her eyes, as if to annihilate herself in the darkness of her abandonment. It was a hole of darkness into which he seemed to be falling.","Gervaise could not weep. She felt as if she were stifling. She covered her face with her hands and turned toward the wall. A sharp, nervous trembling shook her from head to foot. An occasional sobbing sigh or, rather, gasp escaped from her lips, while she pressed her clenched hands more tightly on her eyes, as if to increase the darkness of the abyss in which she felt herself to have fallen.","Gervaise was unable to cry. She was choking, leaning back against her tub, her face still buried in her hands. Brief shudders rocked her body and she wailed out long sighs while pressing her hands tighter against her eyes, as though abandoning herself to the blackness of desolation, a dark, deep pit into which she seemed to be falling."
"- Non, bien sûr, répondit la concierge. Elle est par ici ?","- No, of course not, replied the concierge. Is she around here?","he asked. ""No indeed; is she anywhere round?""","“No, I haven’t,” replied the concierge. “Is she around here?”"
- Merci ! merci ! disait-elle. Oh ! que vous êtes bon ! Merci !,- Thank you ! thank you ! she said. Oh ! how good you are! Thank you !,"""Thank you,"" she said. ""How good you are!""","“Thank you! Thank you!” said she. “Oh, how kind you are! Thank you!”"
"Trois années se passèrent. On se fâcha et on se raccommoda encore plusieurs fois. Gervaise se moquait pas mal des Lorilleux, des Boche et de tous ceux qui ne disaient point comme elle. S'ils n'étaient pas contents, n'est-ce pas ? ils pouvaient aller s'asseoir. Elle gagnait ce qu'elle voulait, c'était le principal. Dans le quartier, on avait fini par avoir pour elle beaucoup de considération, parce que, en somme, on ne trouvait pas des masses de pratiques aussi bonnes, payant recta, pas chipoteuse, pas râleuse. Elle prenait son pain chez madame Coudeloup, rue des Poissonniers, sa viande chez le gros Charles, un boucher de la rue Polonceau, son épicerie chez Lehongre, rue de la Goutte-d'Or, presque en face de sa boutique. François, le marchand de vin du coin de la rue, lui apportait son vin par paniers de cinquante litres. Le voisin Vigouroux, dont la femme devait avoir les hanches bleues, tant les hommes la pinçaient, lui vendait son coke au prix de la Compagnie du gaz. Et, l'on pouvait le dire, ses fournisseurs la servaient en conscience, sachant bien qu'il y avait tout à gagner avec elle, en se montrant gentil. Aussi, quand elle sortait dans le quartier, en savates et en cheveux, recevait-elle des bonjours de tous les côtés ; elle restait là chez elle, les rues voisines étaient comme les dépendances naturelles de son logement, ouvert de plain-pied sur le trottoir. Il lui arrivait maintenant de faire traîner une commission, heureuse d'être dehors, au milieu de ses connaissances. Les jours où elle n'avait pas le temps de mettre quelque chose au feu, elle allait chercher des portions, elle bavardait chez le traiteur, qui occupait la boutique de l'autre côté de la maison, une vaste salle avec de grands vitrages poussiéreux, à travers la saleté desquels on apercevait le jour terni de la cour, au fond. Ou bien, elle s'arrêtait et causait, les mains chargées d'assiettes et de bols, devant quelque fenêtre du rez-de-chaussée, un intérieur de savetier entrevu, le lit défait, le plancher encombré de loques, de deux berceaux éclopés et de la terrine à la poix pleine d'eau noire. Mais le voisin qu'elle respectait le plus était encore, en face, l'horloger, le monsieur en redingote, l'air propre, fouillant continuellement des montres avec des outils mignons ; et souvent elle traversait la rue pour le saluer, riant d'aise à regarder, dans la boutique étroite comme une armoire, la gaieté des petits coucous dont les balanciers se dépêchaient, battant l'heure à contre-temps, tous à la fois.","Three years passed. We got angry and made up several more times. Gervaise made fun of the Lorilleuxs, the Boches and all those who did not say like her. If they weren't happy, right? they could go and sit down. She earned what she wanted, that was the main thing. In the neighborhood, we had ended up having a lot of consideration for her, because, in short, we couldn't find masses of practices as good, paying straight, not quibbling, not complaining. She got her bread from Madame Coudeloup, rue des Poissonniers, her meat from Gros Charles, a butcher in rue Polonceau, her groceries at Lehongre, rue de la Goutte-d'Or, almost opposite her shop. François, the wine merchant on the corner of the street, brought him his wine in fifty-litre baskets. Neighbor Vigouroux, whose wife must have had blue hips, the men pinched her so much, sold him his coke at the price of the Gas Company. And, one could say it, its suppliers served it in conscience, knowing well that there was everything to gain with it, by being kind. Also, when she went out in the neighborhood, in slippers and hair, she received greetings from all sides; she stayed there at home, the neighboring streets were like the natural outbuildings of her lodgings, open on one level to the sidewalk. He now happened to have a commission dragged along, happy to be outside, in the midst of his acquaintances. On days when she didn't have time to put something on the fire, she went to get portions, she chatted to the caterer, who occupied the shop on the other side of the house, a vast room with large dusty windows. , through whose dirt you could see the dim light of the courtyard at the back. Or else she would stop and chat, her hands laden with plates and bowls, in front of some window on the ground floor, a glimpse of the interior of a cobbler, the bed unmade, the floor cluttered with rags, two crippled cradles and pitch terrine full of black water. But the neighbor she respected the most was still, opposite, the watchmaker, the gentleman in a frock coat, looking clean, continually rummaging through watches with cute tools; and often she would cross the street to greet him, laughing with pleasure at watching, in the shop, narrow as a cupboard, the gaiety of the little cuckoo clocks whose pendulums were hurrying, beating the hour out of time, all at the same time.","Three years passed away. There were reconciliations and new quarrels. Gervaise continued to be liked by her neighbors; she paid her bills regularly and was a good customer. When she went out she received cordial greetings on all sides, and she was more fond of going out in these days than of yore. She liked to stand at the corners and chat. She liked to loiter with her arms full of bundles at a neighbor's window and hear a little gossip.","Three years passed by. There were frequent quarrels and reconciliations. Gervaise did not care a straw for the Lorilleux, the Boches and all the others who were not of her way of thinking. If they did not like it, they could forget it. She earned what she wished, that was her principal concern. The people of the neighborhood had ended by greatly esteeming her, for one did not find many customers so kind as she was, paying punctually, never caviling or higgling. She bought her bread of Madame Coudeloup, in the Rue des Poissonniers; her meat of stout Charles, a butcher in the Rue Polonceau; her groceries at Lehongre’s, in the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or, almost opposite her own shop. Francois, the wine merchant at the corner of the street, supplied her with wine in baskets of fifty bottles. Her neighbor Vigouroux, whose wife’s hips must have been black and blue, the men pinched her so much, sold coke to her at the same price as the gas company. And, in all truth, her tradespeople served her faithfully, knowing that there was everything to gain by treating her well. Besides, whenever she went out around the neighborhood, she was greeted everywhere. She felt quite at home. Sometimes she put off doing a laundry job just to enjoy being outdoors among her good friends. On days when she was too rushed to do her own cooking and had to go out to buy something already cooked, she would stop to gossip with her arms full of bowls. The neighbor she respected the most was still the watchmaker. Often she would cross the street to greet him in his tiny cupboard of a shop, taking pleasure in the gaiety of the little cuckoo clocks with their pendulums ticking away the hours in chorus."
"Et la noce dut patienter un quart d'heure encore, piétinant dans la boutique du marchand de vin, coudoyée, bousculée, au milieu des hommes qui entraient boire un canon sur le comptoir. Par moments, Boche, ou madame Fauconnier, ou Bibi-la-Grillade, se détachaient, s'avançaient au bord du trottoir, les yeux en l'air. Ça ne coulait pas du tout ; le jour baissait, des souffles de vent, rasant le sol, enlevaient de petits tourbillons de poussière blanche. Au premier coup de tonnerre, mademoiselle Remanjou se signa. Tous les regards se portaient avec anxiété sur l'œil-de-bœuf, au-dessus de la glace : il était déjà deux heures moins vingt.","And the wedding party had to wait a quarter of an hour longer, trampling in the wine merchant's shop, jostled, jostled, in the midst of the men who came in to drink a cannon on the counter. From time to time, Boche, or Madame Fauconnier, or Bibi-la-Grillade, stood out, advanced to the edge of the sidewalk, eyes in the air. It didn't flow at all; the day was fading, gusts of wind skimming the ground, lifting little whirlwinds of white dust. At the first clap of thunder, Mademoiselle Remanjou crossed herself. All eyes were anxiously fixed on the bull's-eye above the mirror: it was already twenty minutes to two.","They waited another half-hour. The sky was growing blacker and blacker. Clouds of dust were rising along the street, and down came the rain. And it was in the first shower that Mme Lorilleux arrived, out of temper and out of breath, struggling with her umbrella, which she could not close.","And the wedding party had to wait another quarter of an hour, walking about the wineshop, elbowed and jostled in the midst of the men who entered to drink a glass of wine at the bar. Now and again Boche, or Madame Fauconnier, or Bibi-the-Smoker left the others and went to the edge of the pavement, looking up at the sky. The storm was not passing over at all; a darkness was coming on and puffs of wind, sweeping along the ground, raised little clouds of white dust. At the first clap of thunder, Mademoiselle Remanjou made the sign of the cross. All the glances were anxiously directed to the clock over the looking-glass; it was twenty minutes to two."
"Alors, lui, les coudes toujours sur la table, avançant la face davantage, la complimenta en risquant les mots, comme pour la griser. Mais elle disait toujours non de la tête, sans se laisser tenter, caressée pourtant par cette voix câline. Elle écoutait, les regards dehors, paraissant s'intéresser de nouveau à la foule croissante. Maintenant, dans les boutiques vides, on donnait un coup de balai ; la fruitière retirait sa dernière poêlée de pommes de terre frites, tandis que le charcutier remettait en ordre les assiettes débandées de son comptoir. De tous les gargots, des bandes d'ouvriers sortaient ; des gaillards barbus se poussaient d'une claque, jouaient comme des gamins, avec le tapage de leurs gros souliers ferrés, écorchant le pavé dans une glissade ; d'autres, les deux mains au fond de leurs poches, fumaient d'un air réfléchi, les yeux au soleil, les paupières clignotantes. C'était un envahissement du trottoir, de la chaussée, des ruisseaux, un flot paresseux coulant des portes ouvertes, s'arrêtant au milieu des voitures, faisant une traînée de blouses, de bourgerons et de vieux paletots, toute pâlie et déteinte sous la nappe de lumière blonde qui enfilait la rue. Au loin, des cloches d'usine sonnaient ; et les ouvriers ne se pressaient pas, rallumaient des pipes ; puis, le dos arrondi, après s'être appelés d'un marchand de vin à l'autre, ils se décidaient à reprendre le chemin de l'atelier, en traînant les pieds. Gervaise s'amusa à suivre trois ouvriers, un grand et deux petits, qui se retournaient tous les dix pas ; ils finirent par descendre la rue, ils vinrent droit à l'Assommoir du père Colombe.","So he, his elbows still on the table, putting his face forward more, complimented her, risking words, as if to intoxicate her. But she always said no with her head, without letting herself be tempted, caressed nevertheless by this coaxing voice. She listened, staring out, seeming to be interested again in the growing crowd. Now the empty shops were being swept; the greengrocer took out her last pan of fried potatoes, while the charcutier put the disorganized plates of his counter in order. From all the gargots bands of workmen emerged; fellow bearded fellows slapped each other, played like kids, with the din of their big iron shoes, scratching the pavement in a slide; others, both hands deep in their pockets, smoked thoughtfully, their eyes in the sun, their eyelids blinking. It was an invasion of the sidewalk, the roadway, the streams, a lazy stream flowing from the open doors, stopping in the middle of the cars, making a trail of blouses, blouses and old overcoats, all pale and discolored under the a sheet of blond light that encircled the street. In the distance, factory bells were ringing; and the workmen were in no hurry, relighting pipes; then, with their backs hunched over, after calling each other from one wine merchant to another, they would decide to go back to the workshop, dragging their feet. Gervaise amused herself by following three workmen, a tall one and two short ones, who turned round every ten paces; they ended by going down the street, they came straight to Father Colombe's Assommoir.","He, with his elbows on the table, still coaxed and entreated, but she continued to shake her head in the negative. She listened with her eyes fixed on the street, seemingly fascinated by the surging crowd. The shops were being swept; the last frying pan of potatoes was taken from the stove; the pork merchant washed the plates his customers had used and put his place in order. Groups of mechanics were hurrying out from all the workshops, laughing and pushing each other like so many schoolboys, making a great scuffling on the sidewalk with their hobnailed shoes; while some, with their hands in their pockets, smoked in a meditative fashion, looking up at the sun and winking prodigiously. The sidewalks were crowded and the crowd constantly added to by men who poured from the open door—men in blouses and frocks, old jackets and coats, which showed all their defects in the clear morning light. The bells of the various manufactories were ringing loudly, but the workmen did not hurry. They deliberately lighted their pipes and then with rounded shoulders slouched along, dragging their feet after them. Gervaise mechanically watched a group of three, one man much taller than the other two, who seemed to be hesitating as to what they should do next.","With his elbows still on the table, he thrust his face closer to hers and began complimenting her in rather dubious language as though to intoxicate her with his words. But she kept shaking her head “no,” and didn’t allow herself to be tempted although she was flattered by the tone of his voice. While listening, she kept looking out the window, seeming to be fascinated by the interesting crowd of people passing. The shops were now almost empty. The grocer removed his last panful of fried potatoes from the stove. The sausage man arranged the dishes scattered on his counter. Great bearded workmen were as playful as young boys, clumping along in their hobnailed boots. Other workmen were smoking, staring up into the sky and blinking their eyes. Factory bells began to ring in the distance, but the workers, in no hurry, relit their pipes. Later, after being tempted by one wineshop after another, they finally decided to return to their jobs, but were still dragging their feet. Gervaise amused herself by watching three workmen, a tall fellow and two short ones who turned to look back every few yards; they ended by descending the street, and came straight to Pere Colombe’s l’Assommoir."
"Mais un tapage de ferraille étouffa ce cri. Gervaise alla au fond. Elle arriva à une porte, allongea le cou. C'était une vaste salle, où elle ne distingua d'abord rien. La forge, comme morte, avait dans un coin une lueur pâlie d'étoile, qui reculait encore l'enfoncement des ténèbres. De larges ombres flottaient. Et il y avait par moments des masses noires passant devant le feu, bouchant cette dernière tache de clarté, des hommes démesurément grandis dont on devinait les gros membres. Gervaise, n'osant s'aventurer, appelait de la porte, à demi-voix :","But a din of scrap metal stifled this cry. Gervaise went to the back. She came to a door, craned her neck. It was a large room, where at first she could make out nothing. The forge, as if dead, had in one corner the pale gleam of a star, which further pushed back the depression of darkness. Large shadows floated. And there were at times black masses passing in front of the fire, blocking this last spot of light, disproportionately tall men whose large limbs one could guess. Gervaise, not daring to venture, called from the door in a low voice:","Gervaise obeyed his instructions and found herself in a large room with the forge at the farther end. She spoke to the first man she saw, when suddenly the whole room was one blaze of light. The bellows had sent up leaping flames which lit every crevice and corner of the dusty old building, and Gervaise recognized Goujet before the forge with two other men.","But a clanging of iron drowned the cry! Gervaise went to the end. She reached a door and stretching out her neck looked in. At first she could distinguish nothing. The forge had died down, but there was still a little glow which held back the advancing shadows from its corner. Great shadows seemed to float in the air. At times black shapes passed before the fire, shutting off this last bit of brightness, silhouettes of men so strangely magnified that their arms and legs were indistinct. Gervaise, not daring to venture in, called from the doorway in a faint voice:"
Il s'interrompit pour prendre à poignée cinq ou six morceaux de pâte de guimauve.,He broke off to take a handful of five or six pieces of marshmallow paste.,After this she had only to rinse the floor after sweeping the dirty water into the gutter.,He paused to take five or six jujubes in his hand.
"On eut beau lui expliquer que la maladie lui coûterait très cher, si elle prenait son mari chez elle. Elle répétait avec entêtement :",It was no use explaining to her that the illness would cost her dearly if she took her husband home. She repeated stubbornly:,In vain did they tell her that the expenses would be very great if she nursed him at home.,"It was useless for them to explain to her that the illness would cost her a great deal of money, if she took her husband home. She obstinately repeated:"
"- Dites donc, espèce de Borgia ! cria-t-il au père Colombe, donnez-nous de la jaune, de votre pissat d'âne premier numéro.","- Say, you Borgia! he cried to old Colombe, ""give us some yellow, of your first number pissat d'âne.""","Lantier entered to join in, and Mes-Bottes stood there with his hat on the back of his head, shabby, dirty and staggering, ordering Father Colombe to pour out the glasses and not to cheat.","“Say there, old Borgia,” he called to Pere Colombe, “give us some of your yellow stuff, first class mule’s wine.”"
"- Tu ne reconnais pas ce chignon-là ? murmura Gervaise, étranglée. Ma tête à couper que c'est elle !","- You don't recognize that bun? murmured Gervaise, choking. My head to be cut off that it is her!","""Do you not know that hair?"" murmured Gervaise hoarsely. ""I am sure it is she!""",“Don’t you recognize that head of hair?” muttered Gervaise in a stifled voice. “May my head be cut off if it isn’t her.”
"Derrière elle, le lavoir reprenait son bruit énorme d'écluse. Les laveuses avaient mangé leur pain, bu leur vin, et elles tapaient plus dur, les faces allumées, égayées par le coup de torchon de Gervaise et de Virginie. Le long des baquets, de nouveau, s'agitaient une fureur de bras, des profils anguleux de marionnettes aux reins cassés, aux épaules déjetées, se pliant violemment comme sur des charnières. Les conversations continuaient d'un bout à l'autre des allées. Les voix, les rires, les mots gras, se mêlaient dans le grand gargouillement de l'eau. Les robinets crachaient, les seaux jetaient des flaquées, une rivière coulait sous les batteries. C'était le chien de l'après-midi, le linge pilé à coups de battoir. Dans l'immense salle, les fumées devenaient rousses, trouées seulement par des ronds de soleil, des balles d'or, que les déchirures des rideaux laissaient passer. On respirait l'étouffement tiède des odeurs savonneuses. Tout d'un coup, le hangar s'emplit d'une buée blanche ; l'énorme couvercle du cuvier où bouillait la lessive, montait mécaniquement le long d'une tige centrale à crémaillère ; et le trou béant du cuivre, au fond de sa maçonnerie de briques, exhalait des tourbillons de vapeur, d'une saveur sucrée de potasse. Cependant, à côté, les essoreuses fonctionnaient ; des paquets de linge, dans des cylindres de fonte, rendaient leur eau sous un tour de roue de la machine, haletante, fumante, secouant plus rudement le lavoir de la besogne continue de ses bras d'acier.","Behind her, the wash-house resumed its enormous lock noise. The washerwomen had eaten their bread, drank their wine, and they banged harder, their faces lit up, brightened by the wipe of Gervaise and Virginie. Along the tubs, again, a fury of arms swayed, angular profiles of puppets with broken backs, lopsided shoulders, bending violently as on hinges. The conversations continued from one end of the aisles to the other. The voices, the laughter, the fat words, mingled in the great gurgling of the water. Taps spat, buckets squirted, a river flowed under the batteries. It was the dog of the afternoon, the washing pounded with a beater. In the huge hall, the smoke was turning red, pierced only by circles of sunlight, balls of gold, which the tears in the curtains let through. We breathed in the warm suffocation of soapy odors. Suddenly, the shed is filled with a white mist; the enormous lid of the vat where the lye was boiling rose mechanically along a central rack-and-pinion rod; and the gaping hole in the copper, at the bottom of its brick masonry, exhaled whirlwinds of steam, with a sweet taste of potash. However, next door, the wringers were working; bundles of linen, in cast-iron cylinders, released their water under a turn of the wheel of the machine, panting, smoking, shaking the wash-house more roughly from the continuous work of its steel arms.","Behind her the lavatory resumed its wonted busy air, a little gayer than usual from the excitement of the morning. The women had eaten their bread and drunk their wine, and they splashed the water and used their beaters with more energy than usual as they recalled the blows dealt by Gervaise. They talked from alley to alley, leaning over their tubs. Words and laughs were lost in the sound of running water. The steam and mist were golden in the sun that came in through holes in the curtain. The odor of soapsuds grew stronger and stronger. When Gervaise entered the alley which led to the Hôtel Boncoeur her tears choked her.","Once she was gone, the wash-house resumed its roaring tumult. The washerwomen had eaten their bread and drunk their wine. Their faces were lit up and their spirits enlivened by the fight between Gervaise and Virginie. The long lines of tubs were astir again with the fury of thrashing arms, of craggy profiles, of marionettes with bent backs and slumping shoulders that twisted and jerked violently as though on hinges. Conversations went on from one end to the other in loud voices. Laughter and coarse remarks crackled through the ceaseless gurgling of the water. Faucets were sputtering, buckets spilling, rivulets flowing underneath the rows of washboards. Throughout the huge shed rising wisps of steam reflected a reddish tint, pierced here and there by disks of sunlight, golden globes that had leaked through holes in the awnings. The air was stiflingly warm and odorous with soap. Suddenly the hall was filled with a white mist. The huge copper lid of the lye-water kettle was rising mechanically along a notched shaft, and from the gaping copper hollow within its wall of bricks came whirling clouds of vapor. Meanwhile, at one side the drying machines were hard at work; within their cast-iron cylinders bundles of laundry were being wrung dry by the centrifugal force of the steam engine, which was still puffing, steaming, jolting the wash-house with the ceaseless labor of its iron limbs."
"- Madame Gervaise, papa n'est pas rentré, venez donc voir dormir mes enfants ? Oh ! ils sont gentils !","- Madame Gervaise, dad hasn't come home, so come see my children sleep? Oh ! they're nice !","""Dear Madame Gervaise,"" she cried, ""Papa has not come in; please come and see my children. They are sleeping so sweetly!""","“Madame Gervaise, papa has not returned. Just come and see my little children sleeping. Oh! they look so pretty!”"
"Le soir, la crémaillère fut très gaie, chez les Poisson. L'amitié régna sans un accroc, d'un bout à l'autre du repas. Lorsque les mauvais jours arrivent, on tombe ainsi sur de bonnes soirées, des heures où l'on s'aime entre gens qui se détestent. Lantier, ayant à sa gauche Gervaise et Virginie à sa droite, se montra aimable pour toutes les deux, leur prodiguant des tendresses de coq qui veut la paix dans son poulailler. En face, Poisson gardait sa rêverie calme et sévère de sergent de ville, son habitude de ne penser à rien, les yeux voilés, pendant ses longues factions sur les trottoirs. Mais les reines de la fête furent les deux petites, Nana et Pauline, auxquelles on avait permis de ne pas se déshabiller ; elles se tenaient raides, de crainte de tacher leurs robes blanches, et on leur criait, à chaque bouchée, de lever le menton, pour avaler proprement. Nana, ennuyée, finit par baver tout son vin sur son corsage ; ce fut une affaire, on la déshabilla, on lava immédiatement le corsage dans un verre d'eau.","In the evening, the housewarming party was very gay, at the Poissons'. Friendship reigned without a hitch, from one end of the meal to the other. When the bad days arrive, we thus fall on good evenings, hours where we love each other between people who hate each other. Lantier, having Gervaise on his left and Virginie on his right, showed himself kind to both of them, showering them with the tenderness of a rooster who wants peace in his henhouse. Opposite, Poisson kept his calm and severe reverie of a policeman, his habit of thinking of nothing, his eyes veiled, during his long shifts on the sidewalks. But the queens of the party were the two little ones, Nana and Pauline, who had been allowed not to undress; they held themselves stiff, for fear of staining their white dresses, and they were shouted at each mouthful to raise their chins, in order to swallow properly. Nana, bored, ends up drooling all her wine on her blouse; it was a business, they undressed her, they immediately washed the bodice in a glass of water.","The housewarming at the Poissons' that night was very gay. Lantier sat between Gervaise and Virginie and was equally civil and attentive to both. Opposite was Poisson with his calm, impassive face, a look he had cultivated since he began his career as a police officer. But the queens of the fete were the two little girls, Nana and Pauline, who sat very erect lest they should crush and deface their pretty white dresses.","That evening the Poissons’ house-warming was very lively. Friendship reigned without a hitch from one end of the feast to the other. When bad times arrive one thus comes in for some pleasant evenings, hours during which sworn enemies love each other. Lantier, with Gervaise on his left and Virginie on his right, was most amiable to both of them, lavishing little tender caresses like a cock who desires peace in his poultry-yard. But the queens of the feast were the two little ones, Nana and Pauline, who had been allowed to keep on their things; they sat bolt upright through fear of spilling anything on their white dresses and at every mouthful they were told to hold up their chins so as to swallow cleanly. Nana, greatly bored by all this fuss, ended by slobbering her wine over the body of her dress, so it was taken off and the stains were at once washed out in a glass of water."
Il levait déjà le poing. Elle recula et parut prendre une décision.,He was already raising his fist. She stepped back and seemed to make a decision.,"Be off with you, unless you want to be beaten."" He lifted his fist; she recoiled and said with set teeth:","He was already raising his fist. She drew back, and seemed to make up her mind."
"La grande Clémence la traita de vieille bête, entre ses dents. Elle suffoquait, elle pouvait bien se mettre à l'aise ; tout le monde n'avait pas une peau d'amadou. D'ailleurs, est-ce qu'on voyait quelque chose ? Et elle levait les bras, sa gorge puissante de belle fille crevait sa chemise, ses épaules faisaient craquer les courtes manches. Clémence s'en donnait à se vider les moelles avant trente ans ; le lendemain des noces sérieuses, elle ne sentait plus le carreau sous ses pieds, elle dormait sur la besogne, la tête et le ventre comme bourrés de chiffons. Mais on la gardait quand même, car pas une ouvrière ne pouvait se flatter de repasser une chemise d'homme avec son chic. Elle avait la spécialité des chemises d'homme.","Tall Clemence called her an old beast between her teeth. She was suffocating, she could put herself at ease; not everyone had tinder skin. Besides, did we see anything? And she raised her arms, her powerful, beautiful girlish bosom bursting her shirt, her shoulders cracking the short sleeves. Clemence took it upon herself to empty her marrow before she was thirty; the day after the serious wedding, she no longer felt the tiles under her feet, she slept on her job, her head and stomach as if stuffed with rags. But we kept it all the same, because not a worker could flatter herself that she was ironing a man's shirt with her chic. She specialized in men's shirts.",Clémence grumbled and growled. What did she care what she liked?,"Tall Clemence called her an old beast between her teeth. She was suffocating; she might certainly make herself comfortable; everyone was not gifted with a skin as dry as touchwood. Besides no one could see anything; and she held up her arms, whilst her opulent bosom almost ripped her chemise, and her shoulders were bursting through the straps. At the rate she was going, Clemence was not likely to have any marrow left in her bones long before she was thirty years old. Mornings after big parties she was unable to feel the ground she trod upon, and fell asleep over her work, whilst her head and her stomach seemed as though stuffed full of rags. But she was kept on all the same, for no other workwoman could iron a shirt with her style. Shirts were her specialty."
Sapristi ! qu'est-ce qui paiera,Holy shit! what will pay,The windows of the shop jarred with the noise.,By Jingo! who on earth will pay
"- Ceux qui ont soif, ont soif, et ceux qui n'ont pas soif, n'ont pas soif, fit remarquer Mes-Bottes. Pour lors, on va commander le brûlot ? On n'esbrouffe personne. Les aristos feront monter de l'eau sucrée.","- Those who are thirsty, are thirsty, and those who are not thirsty, are not thirsty, My-Boots pointed out. For then, are we going to order the firebrand? We don't piss anyone off. The aristos will raise sugar water.","""Those who are thirsty are thirsty,"" he said. ""No one need drink that does not wish to do so, I am sure."" And he added with a wink, ""There will be all the more for those who do!""","They declared in hoarse drunken voices that they were thirsty and wanted drinks. “Those who’re thirsty are thirsty, and those who aren’t thirsty aren’t thirsty,” remarked My-Boots. “Therefore, we’ll order the punch. No one need take offence. The aristocrats can drink sugar-and-water.”"
"- Donnez-vous la main, nom de Dieu ! cria Coupeau, et foutons-nous des bourgeois ! Quand on a de ça dans le coco, voyez-vous, on est plus chouette que les millionnaires. Moi, je mets l'amitié avant tout, parce que l'amitié, c'est l'amitié, et qu'il n'y a rien au-dessus.","- Join hands, for God's sake! cried Coupeau, and let's not give a damn about the bourgeois! When we have that in the coconut, you see, we are nicer than the millionaires. Me, I put friendship above all else, because friendship is friendship, and there is nothing above it.","""Give us your hand on that,"" cried Coupeau, ""and let us be good friends in the future. After all, a good heart is better than gold, and I estimate friendship as above all price.""","“Mon Dieu! shake hands,” cried Coupeau, “and let those who don’t like it go to blazes! When one has proper feelings one is better off than millionaires. For myself I prefer friendship before everything because friendship is friendship and there’s nothing to beat it.”"
"Oui, Coupeau et Lantier l'usaient, c'était le mot ; ils la brûlaient par les deux bouts, comme on dit de la chandelle. Bien sûr, le zingueur manquait d'instruction ; mais le chapelier en avait trop, ou du moins il avait une instruction comme les gens pas propres ont une chemise blanche, avec la crasse par-dessous. Une nuit, elle rêva qu'elle était au bord d'un puits ; Coupeau la poussait d'un coup de poing, tandis que Lantier lui chatouillait les reins pour la faire sauter plus vite. Eh bien ! ça ressemblait à sa vie. Ah ! elle était à bonne école, ça n'avait rien d'étonnant, si elle s'avachissait. Les gens du quartier ne se montraient guère justes, quand ils lui reprochaient les vilaines façons qu'elle prenait, car son malheur ne venait pas d'elle. Parfois, lorsqu'elle réfléchissait, un frisson lui courait sur la peau. Puis, elle pensait que tes choses auraient pu tourner plus mal encore. Il valait mieux avoir deux hommes, par exemple, que de perdre les deux bras. Et elle trouvait sa position naturelle, une position comme il y en a tant ; elle tâchait de s'arranger là-dedans un petit bonheur. Ce qui prouvait combien ça devenait popote et bonhomme, c'était qu'elle ne détestait pas plus Coupeau que Lantier. Dans une pièce, à la Gaité, elle avait vu une garce qui abominait son mari et l'empoisonnait, à cause de son amant ; et elle s'était fâchée, parce qu'elle ne sentait rien de pareil dans son cœur. Est-ce qu'il n'était pas plus raisonnable de vivre en bon accord tous les trois ? Non, non, pas de ces bêtises-là ; ça dérangeait la vie, qui n'avait déjà rien de bien drôle. Enfin, malgré les dettes, malgré la misère qui les menaçait, elle se serait déclarée très tranquille, très contente, si le zingueur et le chapelier l'avaient moins échinée et moins engueulée.","Yes, Coupeau and Lantier used it, that was the word; they burned it at both ends, as one says of a candle. Of course, the zinc worker lacked education; but the hatter had too many, or at least he had an education like unclean people have a white shirt, with dirt underneath. One night she dreamed that she was at the edge of a well; Coupeau pushed her with a punch, while Lantier tickled her loins to make her jump faster. Well ! it felt like his life. Ah! she was in good school, it was not surprising, if she slouched. The people of the neighborhood were hardly fair when they reproached her for the ugly ways she adopted, for her misfortune did not come from her. Sometimes, when she thought, a shiver ran over her skin. Then she thought your things could have gone even worse. It was better to have two men, for example, than to lose both arms. And she found her natural position, a position like so many; she was trying to make a little happiness out of it. What proved how much it was becoming cooking and good-natured was that she hated Coupeau no more than Lantier. In a room, at the Gaite, she had seen a bitch who abominated her husband and poisoned him, because of her lover; and she was angry, because she felt nothing like it in her heart. Wasn't it more reasonable to live in good agreement all three? No, no, not that nonsense; it disturbed life, which already had nothing very funny about it. Finally, despite the debts, despite the misery that threatened them, she would have declared herself very calm, very happy, if the zinc worker and the hatter had less tormented and berated her.","Coupeau was pushing her down with his fists, and Lantier was tickling her to make her jump out quicker. And this, she thought, was a very fair picture of her life! She said that the people of the Quartier were very unjust, after all, when they reproached her for the way of life into which she had fallen. It was not her fault. It was not she who had done it, and a little shiver ran over her as she reflected that perhaps the worst was not yet. The utter deterioration of her nature was shown by the fact that she detested neither her husband nor Lantier. In a play at the Gaite she had seen a woman hate her husband and poison him for the sake of her lover. This she thought very strange and unnatural. Why could the three not have lived together peaceably? It would have been much more reasonable! In spite of her debts, in spite of the shifts to which her increasing poverty condemned her, Gervaise would have considered herself quite well off, but for the exacting selfishness of Lantier and Coupeau.","Yes, Coupeau and Lantier were wearing her out. The zinc-worker, sure enough, lacked education; but the hatter had too much, or at least he had education in the same way that dirty people have a white shirt, with uncleanliness underneath it. One night, she dreamt that she was on the edge of a wall; Coupeau was knocking her into it with a blow of his fist, whilst Lantier was tickling her in the ribs to make her fall quicker. Well! That resembled her life. It was no surprise if she was becoming slipshod. The neighbors weren’t fair in blaming her for the frightful habits she had fallen into. Sometimes a cold shiver ran through her, but things could have been worse, so she tried to make the best of it. Once she had seen a play in which the wife detested her husband and poisoned him for the sake of her lover. Wasn’t it more sensible for the three of them to live together in peace? In spite of her debts and poverty she thought she was quite happy and could live in peace if only Coupeau and Lantier would stop yelling at her so much."
"L'Assommoir s'était empli. On parlait très fort, avec des éclats de voix qui déchiraient le murmure gras des enrouements. Des coups de poing sur le comptoir, par moments, faisaient tinter les verres. Tous debout, les mains croisées sur le ventre ou rejetées derrière le dos, les buveurs formaient de petits groupes, serrés les uns contre les autres ; il y avait des sociétés, près des tonneaux, qui devaient attendre un quart d'heure, avant de pouvoir commander leurs tournées au père Colombe.","L'Assommoir had filled up. They were talking very loudly, with bursts of voice that tore through the greasy murmur of hoarseness. Fists on the counter occasionally made the glasses clink. All standing, hands crossed over their stomachs or thrown behind their backs, the drinkers formed small groups, huddled together; there were companies, near the barrels, which had to wait a quarter of an hour before being able to order their rounds from Father Colombe.","The Assommoir was now crowded with boisterous men. Two glasses rang with the energy with which they brought down their fists on the counter. They stood in rows, with their hands crossed over their stomachs or folded behind their backs, waiting their turn to be served by Father Colombe.","Pere Colombe’s l’Assommoir was now full. You had to shout to be heard. Fists often pounded on the bar, causing the glasses to clink. Everyone was standing, hands crossed over belly or held behind back. The drinking groups crowded close to one another. Some groups, by the casks, had to wait a quarter of an hour before being able to order their drinks of Pere Colombe."
"La rue Neuve de la Goutte-d'Or elle-même entrait pour une bonne part dans leur contentement. Gervaise y vivait, allant sans cesse de chez elle chez madame Fauconnier. Coupeau, le soir, descendait maintenant, fumait sa pipe sur le pas de la porte. La rue, sans trottoir, le pavé défoncé, montait. En haut, du côté de la rue de la Goutte-d'Or, il y avait des boutiques sombres, aux carreaux sales, des cordonniers, des tonneliers, une épicerie borgne, un marchand de vin en faillite, dont les volets fermés depuis des semaines se couvraient d'affiches. A l'autre bout, vers Paris, des maisons de quatre étages barraient le ciel, occupées à leur rez-de-chaussée par des blanchisseuses, les unes près des autres, en tas ; seule, une devanture de perruquier de petite ville, peinte en vert, toute pleine de flacons aux couleurs tendres, égayait ce coin d'ombre du vif éclair de ses plats de cuivre, tenus très propres. Mais la gaieté de la rue se trouvait au milieu, à l'endroit où les constructions, en devenant plus rares et plus basses, laissaient descendre l'air et le soleil. Les hangars du loueur de voitures, l'établissement voisin où l'on fabriquait de l'eau de Seltz, le lavoir, en face, élargissaient un vaste espace libre, silencieux, dans lequel les voix étouffées des laveuses et l'haleine régulière de la machine à vapeur semblaient grandir encore le recueillement. Des terrains profonds, des allées s'enfonçant entre des murs noirs, mettaient là un village. Et Coupeau, amusé par les rares passants qui enjambaient le ruissellement continu des eaux savonneuses, disait ce souvenir d'un pays où l'avait conduit un de ses oncles, à l'âge de cinq ans. La joie de Gervaise était, à gauche de sa fenêtre, un arbre planté dans une cour, un acacia allongeant une seule de ses branches, et dont la maigre verdure suffisait au charme de toute la rue.","The Rue Neuve de la Goutte-d'Or itself played a large part in their contentment. Gervaise lived there, constantly going from her house to Madame Fauconnier. Coupeau now came downstairs in the evening, smoking his pipe on the doorstep. The street, without sidewalks, the rutted cobblestones, rose. Upstairs, on the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or side, there were dark shops with dirty windows, shoemakers, coopers, a one-eyed grocery store, a bankrupt wine merchant whose shutters had been closed for decades. weeks were covered with posters. At the other end, towards Paris, four-storey houses barred the sky, occupied on their ground floor by laundresses, one close to the other, in a heap; only a small-town wigmaker's shop window, painted green, full of soft-coloured bottles, brightened this shady corner with the bright flash of its copper plates, which were kept very clean. But the cheerfulness of the street was in the middle, where the buildings, becoming rarer and lower, let in the air and the sun. The sheds of the car rental company, the nearby establishment where seltzer water was made, the wash house opposite, widened a vast free space, silent, in which the muffled voices of the washerwomen and the regular breath of the steam engine seemed to increase the contemplation still further. Deep ground, alleys sinking between black walls, placed a village there. And Coupeau, amused by the rare passers-by who stepped over the continuous trickling of soapy water, recounted this memory of a country where one of his uncles had taken him when he was five years old. Gervaise's joy was, to the left of her window, a tree planted in a courtyard, an acacia stretching out only one of its branches, the meager greenery of which sufficed to charm the whole street.","No small portion of the woman's satisfaction arose from an acacia which grew in her courtyard, one of whose branches crossed her window, and the scanty foliage was a whole wilderness to her.","The street, Rue Neuve de la Goutte d’Or, played an important part in their contentment. Gervaise’s whole life was there, as she traveled back and forth endlessly between her home and Madame Fauconnier’s laundry. Coupeau now went down every evening and stood on the doorstep to smoke his pipe. The poorly-paved street rose steeply and had no sidewalks. Toward Rue de la Goutte d’Or there were some gloomy shops with dirty windows. There were shoemakers, coopers, a run-down grocery, and a bankrupt cafe whose closed shutters were covered with posters. In the opposite direction, toward Paris, four-story buildings blocked the sky. Their ground floor shops were all occupied by laundries with one exception—a green-painted store front typical of a small-town hair-dresser. Its shop windows were full of variously colored flasks. It lighted up this drab corner with the gay brightness of its copper bowls which were always shining. The most pleasant part of the street was in between, where the buildings were fewer and lower, letting in more sunlight. The carriage sheds, the plant which manufactured soda water, and the wash-house opposite made a wide expanse of quietness. The muffled voices of the washerwomen and the rhythmic puffing of the steam engine seemed to deepen the almost religious silence. Open fields and narrow lanes vanishing between dark walls gave it the air of a country village. Coupeau, always amused by the infrequent pedestrians having to jump over the continuous streams of soapy water, said it reminded him of a country town where his uncle had taken him when he was five years old. Gervaise’s greatest joy was a tree growing in the courtyard to the left of their window, an acacia that stretched out a single branch and yet, with its meager foliage, lent charm to the entire street."
"Pourtant, pas un chat ne sortait de chez le patron. Enfin, un ouvrier parut, puis deux, puis trois ; mais ceux-là, sans doute, étaient de bons zigs, qui rapportaient fidèlement leur prêt, car ils eurent un hochement de tête en apercevant les ombres rôdant devant l'atelier. La grande haridelle se collait davantage à côté de la porte ; et, tout d'un coup, elle tomba sur un petit homme pâlot, en train d'allonger prudemment la tête. Oh ! ce fut vite réglé ! elle le fouilla, lui ratissa la monnaie. Pincé, plus de braise, pas de quoi boire une goutte ! Alors, le petit homme, vexé et désespéré, suivit son gendarme en pleurant de grosses larmes d'enfant. Des ouvriers sortaient toujours, et comme la forte commère, avec ses deux mioches, s'était approchée, un grand brun, l'air roublard, qui l'aperçut, rentra vivement pour prévenir le mari ; lorsque celui-ci arriva en se dandinant, il avait étouffé deux roues de derrière, deux belles pièces de cent sous neuves, une dans chaque soulier. Il prit l'un de ses gosses sur son bras, il s'en alla en contant des craques à sa bourgeoise qui le querellait. Il y en avait de rigolos, sautant d'un bond dans la rue, pressés de courir béquiller leur quinzaine avec les amis. Il y en avait aussi de lugubres, la mine rafalée, serrant dans leur poing crispé les trois ou quatre journées sur quinze qu'ils avaient faites, se traitant de feignants et faisant des serments d'ivrogne. Mais le plus triste, c'était la douleur de la petite femme noire, humble et délicate : son homme, un beau garçon, venait de se cavaler sous son nez, si brutalement, qu'il avait failli la jeter par terre ; et elle rentrait seule, chancelant le long des boutiques, pleurant toutes les larmes de son corps.","However, not a cat came out of the boss. Finally, a workman appeared, then two, then three; but those, no doubt, were good zigs, returning their loan faithfully, for they nodded when they saw the shadows prowling in front of the workshop. The big weed clung closer to the door; and all of a sudden she came across a pale little man, cautiously putting his head out. Oh ! it was quickly settled! she searched him, raked out his change. Pinched, more embers, nothing to drink a drop! Then the little man, vexed and desperate, followed his policeman, crying big childish tears. Workmen were still going out, and as the strong gossip, with her two brats, had approached, a tall dark-haired man, with a cunning air, who saw her, came back quickly to warn the husband; when the latter arrived waddling, he had muffled two rear wheels, two beautiful new hundred-sou coins, one in each shoe. He took one of his kids on his arm, he went away, telling the cracks to his bourgeoise who was quarreling with him. There were some funny ones, leaping into the street, in a hurry to run to crutch their fortnight with friends. There were also lugubrious ones, their faces squalled, clutching in their clenched fists the three or four days out of the fifteen they had worked, calling themselves lazy and making drunken oaths. But the saddest thing was the pain of the little black woman, humble and delicate: her man, a handsome boy, had just run under her nose, so brutally, that he almost threw her on the ground; and she would come home alone, tottering along the shops, weeping all the tears in her body.","Then it opened to allow the egress of one workman; then two, three, followed, but these were probably those who, well behaved, took their wages home to their wives, for they neither retreated nor started when they saw the little crowd. One woman fell on a pale little fellow and, plunging her hand into his pocket, carried off every sou of her husband's earnings, while he, left without enough to pay for a pint of wine, went off down the street almost weeping. Some other men appeared, and one turned back to warn a comrade, who came gamely and fearlessly out, having put his silver pieces in his shoes. In vain did his wife look for them in his pockets; in vain did she scold and coax—he had no money, he declared. Then came another noisy group, elbowing each other in their haste to reach a cabaret, where they could drink away their week's wages. These fellows were followed by some shabby men who were swearing under their breath at the trifle they had received, having been tipsy and absent more than half the week. But the saddest sight of all was the grief of a meek little woman in black, whose husband, a tall, good-looking fellow, pushed her roughly aside and walked off down the street with his boon companions, leaving her to go home alone, which she did, weeping her very heart out as she went.","However, nobody as yet left the zinc-works. But presently one workman appeared, then two, and then three, but these were no doubt decent fellows who took their pay home regularly, for they jerked their heads significantly as they saw the shadows wandering up and down. The tall creature stuck closer than ever to the side of the door, and suddenly fell upon a pale little man who was prudently poking his head out. Oh! it was soon settled! She searched him and collared his coin. Caught, no more money, not even enough to pay for a dram! Then the little man, looking very vexed and cast down, followed his gendarme, weeping like a child. The workmen were still coming out; and as the fat mother with the two brats approached the door, a tall fellow, with a cunning look, who noticed her, went hastily inside again to warn her husband; and when the latter arrived he had stuffed a couple of cart wheels away, two beautiful new five franc pieces, one in each of his shoes. He took one of the brats on his arm, and went off telling a variety of lies to his old woman who was complaining. There were other workmen also, mournful-looking fellows, who carried in their clinched fists the pay for the three or five days’ work they had done during a fortnight, who reproached themselves with their own laziness, and took drunkards’ oaths. But the saddest thing of all was the grief of the dark little woman, with the humble, delicate look; her husband, a handsome fellow, took himself off under her very nose, and so brutally indeed that he almost knocked her down, and she went home alone, stumbling past the shops and weeping all the tears in her body."
"- Ça, c'est plus fort ! cria-t-elle. Tu vas coucher dans la chambre à la Banban ! Gervaise devint toute pâle. Ce surnom, qu'elle recevait à la face pour la première fois, la frappait comme un soufflet. Puis, elle entendait bien l'exclamation de sa belle-sœur : la chambre à la Banban, c'était la chambre où elle avait vécu un mois avec Lantier, où les loques de sa vie passée traînaient encore. Coupeau ne comprit pas, fut seulement blessé du surnom.","- That's stronger! she cried. You're going to sleep in the Banban room! Gervaise turned quite pale. This nickname, which she received in her face for the first time, struck her like a blow. Then she heard her sister-in-law's exclamation clearly: the Banban room was the room where she had lived for a month with Lantier, where the rags of her past life still lay about. Coupeau did not understand, was only hurt by the nickname.","""What!"" she exclaimed. ""You are going to live in Wooden Legs' room?"" Gervaise turned pale. This name she now heard for the first time, and it was like a slap in the face. She heard much more in her sister-in-law's exclamation than met the ear. That room to which allusion was made was the one where she had lived with Lantier for a whole month, where she had wept such bitter tears, but Coupeau did not understand that; he was only wounded by the name applied to his wife.","“That’s worse than all!” cried she. “You’re going to sleep in Clump-clump’s room.” Gervaise became quite pale. This nickname, which she received full in the face for the first time, fell on her like a blow. And she fully understood it, too, her sister-in-law’s exclamation: the Clump-clump’s room was the room in which she had lived for a month with Lantier, where the shreds of her past life still hung about. Coupeau did not understand this, but merely felt hurt at the harsh nickname."
"Plantée devant l'Assommoir, Gervaise songeait. Si elle avait eu deux sous, elle serait entrée boire la goutte. Peut-être qu'une goutte lui aurait coupé la faim. Ah ! elle en avait bu des gouttes ! Ça lui semblait bien bon tout de même. Et, de loin, elle contemplait la machine à soûler, en sentant que son malheur venait de là, et en faisant le rêve de s'achever avec de l'eau-de-vie, le jour où elle aurait de quoi. Mais un frisson lui passa dans les cheveux, elle vit que la nuit était noire. Allons, la bonne heure arrivait. C'était l'instant d'avoir du cœur et de se montrer gentille, si elle ne voulait pas crever au milieu de l'allégresse générale. D'autant plus que de voir les autres bâfrer ne lui remplissait pas précisément le ventre. Elle ralentit encore le pas, regarda autour d'elle. Sous les arbres, traînait une ombre plus épaisse. Il passait peu de monde, des gens pressés, traversant vivement le boulevard. Et, sur ce large trottoir sombre et désert, où venaient mourir les gaietés des chaussées voisines, des femmes, debout, attendaient. Elles restaient de longs moments immobiles, patientes, raidies comme les petits platanes maigres ; puis, lentement, elles se mouvaient, traînaient leurs savates sur le sol glacé, faisaient dix pas et s'arrêtaient de nouveau, collées à la terre. Il y en avait une, au tronc énorme, avec des jambes et des bras d'insecte, débordante et roulante, dans une guenille de soie noire, coiffée d'un foulard jaune ; il y en avait une autre, grande, sèche, en cheveux, qui avait un tablier de bonne ; et d'autres encore, des vieilles replâtrées, des jeunes très sales, si sales, si minables, qu'un chiffonnier ne les aurait pas ramassées. Gervaise, pourtant, ne savait pas, tâchait d'apprendre, en faisant comme elles. Une émotion de petite fille la serrait à la gorge ; elle ne sentait pas si elle avait honte, elle agissait dans un vilain rêve. Pendant un quart d'heure, elle se tint toute droite.","Planted in front of L'Assommoir, Gervaise thought. If she had had two sous, she would have gone in for a drink. Perhaps a drop would have cut her hunger. Ah! she had drunk drops of it! It seemed very good to him all the same. And, from afar, she gazed at the machine to drink, feeling that her misfortune came from there, and dreaming of ending herself with brandy, the day when she would have something. But a shiver passed through her hair, she saw that the night was dark. Come on, the good hour was coming. Now was the time to have a heart and be kind, if she didn't want to die in the midst of the general joy. Especially since seeing the others guzzle didn't exactly fill his belly. She slowed her pace again, looked around her. Beneath the trees trailed a thicker shadow. Few people passed, people in a hurry, crossing the boulevard briskly. And, on this wide dark and deserted sidewalk, where the gaiety of the neighboring roads died away, women were standing, waiting. They remained motionless for long moments, patient, stiff as the thin little plane trees; then, slowly, they moved, dragged their slippers on the icy ground, took ten steps and stopped again, glued to the ground. There was one, with an enormous trunk, with the legs and arms of an insect, overflowing and rolling, in a rag of black silk, wearing a yellow scarf; there was another, tall, lean, with thin hair, who wore a maid's apron; and still others, old plastered ones, very dirty young ones, so dirty, so shabby, that a ragpicker wouldn't have picked them up. Gervaise, however, did not know, tried to learn, doing like them. A little girl's emotion gripped her throat; she didn't feel if she was ashamed, she was acting in an ugly dream. For a quarter of an hour she held herself straight.","Gervaise wished she had a few sous: she would, in that case, have gone into this place and drunk until she ceased to feel hungry, and through the window she watched the still with an angry consciousness that all her misery and all her pain came from that. If she had never touched a drop of liquor all might have been so different. She started from her reverie; this was the hour of which she must take advantage. Men had dined and were comparatively amiable. She looked around her and toward the trees where—under the leafless branches—she saw more than one female figure. Gervaise watched them, determined to do what they did. Her heart was in her throat; it seemed to her that she was dreaming a bad dream. She stood for some fifteen minutes; none of the men who passed looked at her.","Gervaise stood in front of l’Assommoir, thinking that if she had had a couple of sous she could have gone inside and drunk a dram. No doubt a dram would have quieted her hunger. Ah! what a number of drams she had drunk in her time! Liquor seemed good stuff to her after all. And from outside she watched the drunk-making machine, realizing that her misfortune was due to it, and yet dreaming of finishing herself off with brandy on the day she had some coin. But a shudder passed through her hair as she saw it was now almost dark. Well, the night time was approaching. She must have some pluck and sell herself coaxingly if she didn’t wish to kick the bucket in the midst of the general revelry. Looking at other people gorging themselves didn’t precisely fill her own stomach. She slackened her pace again and looked around her. There was a darker shade under the trees. Few people passed along, only folks in a hurry, who swiftly crossed the Boulevards. And on the broad, dark, deserted footway, where the sound of the revelry died away, women were standing and waiting. They remained for long intervals motionless, patient and as stiff-looking as the scrubby little plane trees; then they slowly began to move, dragging their slippers over the frozen soil, taking ten steps or so and then waiting again, rooted as it were to the ground. There was one of them with a huge body and insect-like arms and legs, wearing a black silk rag, with a yellow scarf over her head; there was another one, tall and bony, who was bareheaded and wore a servant’s apron; and others, too—old ones plastered up and young ones so dirty that a ragpicker would not have picked them up. However, Gervaise tried to learn what to do by imitating them; girlish-like emotion tightened her throat; she was hardly aware whether she felt ashamed or not; she seemed to be living in a horrible dream. For a quarter of an hour she remained standing erect."
"Puis, les maisons s'effondraient, il imitait le craquement d'un quartier qui croule ; et tout disparaissait, tout s'envolait. Mais il n'avait pas le temps de souffler, d'autres tableaux passaient, avec une mobilité extraordinaire. Un besoin furieux de parler lui emplissait la bouche de mots, qu'il lâchait sans suite, avec un barbotement de la gorge. Il haussait toujours la voix.","Then the houses crumbled, he imitated the creaking of a crumbling neighborhood; and everything disappeared, everything flew away. But he didn't have time to take a breather, other pictures passed by with extraordinary mobility. A furious need to speak filled his mouth with words, which he let out without follow-up, with a bubbling in his throat. He was still raising his voice.","And he gesticulated to the men who, he said, were pointing their guns at him. He talked incessantly, his voice growing louder and louder, higher and higher.","Then, the buildings were tumbling down, he imitated the cracking of a whole neighborhood collapsing; and all disappeared, all flew off. But he had no time to take breath, other pictures passed with extraordinary rapidity. A furious desire to speak filled his mouth full of words which he uttered without any connection, and with a gurgling sound in his throat. He continued to raise his voice, louder and louder."

- Taisez-vous donc ! cria la sage-femme.,- Shut up then! cried the midwife.,"""You must be quiet,"" said the nurse again.",“Keep quiet!” cried the midwife.
"- Dépêchez-vous un peu, n'est-ce pas ? Ça n'avance guère la besogne, de rester là comme une borne ? Voyons, remuez-vous, je n'ai pas envie de patauger dans l'eau jusqu'à ce soir. Et elle ajouta plus bas, méchamment :","- Hurry up a bit, right? Doesn't it make much progress, staying there like a milestone? Come on, get moving, I don't feel like wading through water until tonight. And she added lower, spitefully:","""Pray make haste,"" exclaimed Virginie fretfully. ""I do not care to have this scrubbing going on until midnight."" Gervaise returned to her work.","“Just make haste, eh? The work doesn’t do itself while you remain stuck there like a street post. Come, look alive, I don’t want to flounder about in the water till night time.” And she added hatefully in a lower tone: “It isn’t my fault if her daughter’s gone and left her.”"
"Et elle s'en alla, parce que l'odeur forte de la soupe aux choux et la bonne chaleur de l'atelier la rendaient trop malade.","And she left, because the strong smell of cabbage soup and the good heat of the workshop made her too sick.",And she went away; the warmth of the place and the smell of the soup were unbearable.,"And then she went off, because the strong smell of the cabbage soup and the warmth of the workroom made her feel too ill."

I sit on the benches, you know, if I don't have my soup!","""I want my soup,"" cried Coupeau, ""and you two fools are chattering over those fal-lals! I tell you, I will sit on them if I am not waited upon, and quickly too.""","“Where’s my food?” yelled the zinc-worker. “I want my soup, you couple of jades!

"Qu'est-ce qu'il a, à m'emmoutarder, cet encloué de singe ? cria Bec-Salé au dessert. Est-ce qu'il ne vient pas d'avoir l'idée d'accrocher une cloche dans sa baraque ?

S'il me fiche un abattage, je l'envoie à Chaillot.","What's wrong with me, this screwed-up monkey? cried Bec-Sale at dessert. Didn't he just have the idea of hanging a bell in his barracks? A bell, is it good for slaves? Ah well ! it can ring today! Thunder if they pinch me back on the anvil! I've been crowding it for five days, can I throw it away? If he gives me a slaughter, I send him to Chaillot.","They went to a restaurant and ordered a famous repast of pigs' feet, and they sat and sucked the bones and talked about their various employers.

Never was he so mistaken—""","“What do you think is the ape’s latest idea?” cried Salted-Mouth at dessert. “Why, he’s been and put a bell up in his shed! A bell! That’s good for slaves. Ah, well! It can ring to-day! They won’t catch me again at the anvil! For five days past I’ve been sticking there; I may give myself a rest now. If he deducts anything, I’ll send him to blazes.”"
"- Il est très distingué, déclara-t-elle en rentrant dans l'allée. S'il avait seulement des intentions honnêtes ?","""He's very distinguished,"" she declared as she walked into the driveway.

- Vous en avez fait un bruit ! Je n'ai pas seulement pu compter les marches.,- You made a noise! I couldn't even count the steps.,"""Upon my word!"" cried Mme Lorilleux, much scandalized. Madinier again constituted himself master of ceremonies and pointed out all the monuments, but Mme Fauconnier would not put her foot outside the little door; she would not look down on that pavement for all the world, she said, and the party soon tired of this amusement and descended the stairs.",“You made such a noise together! I wasn’t even able to count the steps.”
"Et, quand les jambes lui revinrent, il garda une sourde rancune contre le travail. C'était un métier de malheur, de passer ses journées comme les chats, le long des gouttières. Eux pas bêtes, les bourgeois ! ils vous envoyaient à la mort, bien trop poltrons pour se risquer sur une échelle, s'installant solidement au coin de leur feu et se fichant du pauvre monde. Et il en arrivait à dire que chacun aurait dû poser son zinc sur sa maison. Dame ! en bonne justice, on devait en venir là : si tu ne veux pas être mouillé, mets-toi à couvert. Puis, il regrettait de ne pas avoir appris un autre métier, plus joli et moins dangereux, celui d'ébéniste, par exemple. Ça, c'était encore la faute du père Coupeau ; les pères avaient cette bête d'habitude de fourrer quand même les enfants dans leur partie.","And when his legs came back to him, he harbored a deep resentment against work. It was a job of misfortune, to spend one's days like cats, along the gutters. Them not stupid, the bourgeois! they sent you to your death, far too cowardly to risk themselves on a ladder, settling themselves firmly by the corner of their fire and not caring about the poor world. And he came to say that everyone should have put his zinc on his house. Lady ! in fairness, it had to come to this: if you don't want to get wet, take cover. Then he regretted not having learned another trade, prettier and less dangerous, that of cabinetmaker, for example. That was Father Coupeau's fault again; the fathers had this stupid habit of stuffing the children into their game all the same.","And as his strength returned his trade grew strangely distasteful to him. It was a miserable business, he said, roaming along gutters like a cat. In his opinion there should be a law which should compel every houseowner to tin his own roof. He wished he knew some other trade he could follow, something that was less dangerous. For two months more Coupeau walked with a crutch and after a while was able to get into the street and then to the outer boulevard, where he sat on a bench in the sun.","And when at last he was able to use his legs, he retained a secret grudge against work. It was a handicraft full of misfortunes to pass one’s days, like the cats, on the roofs of the houses. The employers were no fools! They sent you to your death—being far too cowardly to venture themselves on a ladder—and stopped at home in safety at their fire-sides without caring a hang for the poorer classes; and he got to the point of saying that everyone ought to fix the zinc himself on his own house. Mon Dieu! It was the only fair way to do it! If you don’t want the rain to come in, do the work yourself. He regretted he hadn’t learned another trade, something more pleasant, something less dangerous, maybe cabinetmaking. It was really his father’s fault. Lots of fathers have the foolish habit of shoving their sons into their own line of work."
"Gervaise, depuis longtemps, s'était remise au travail. Elle n'avait plus la peine d'enlever et de replacer le globe de la pendule ; toutes les économies se trouvaient mangées ; et il fallait piocher dur, piocher pour quatre, car ils étaient quatre bouches à table. Elle seule nourrissait tout ce monde. Quand elle entendait les gens la plaindre, elle excusait vite Coupeau. Pensez donc ! il avait tant souffert, ce n'était pas étonnant, si son caractère prenait de l'aigreur ! Mais ça passerait avec la santé. Et si on lui laissait entendre que Coupeau semblait solide à présent, qu'il pouvait bien retourner au chantier, elle se récriait. Non, non, pas encore ! Elle ne voulait pas l'avoir de nouveau au lit. Elle savait bien ce que le médecin lui disait, peut-être ! C'était elle qui l'empêchait de travailler, en lui répétant chaque matin de prendre son temps, de ne pas se forcer. Elle lui glissait même des pièces de vingt sous dans la poche de son gilet. Coupeau acceptait ça comme une chose naturelle ; il se plaignait de toutes sortes de douleurs pour se faire dorloter ; au bout de six mois, sa convalescence durait toujours. Maintenant, les jours où il allait regarder travailler les autres, il entrait volontiers boire un canon avec les camarades. Tout de même, on n'était pas mal chez le marchand de vin ; on rigolait, on restait là cinq minutes. Ça ne déshonorait personne. Les poseurs seuls affectaient de crever de soif à la porte. Autrefois, on avait bien raison de le blaguer, attendu qu'un verre de vin n'a jamais tué un homme. Mais il se tapait la poitrine en se faisant un honneur de ne boire que du vin ; toujours du vin, jamais de l'eau-de-vie ; le vin prolongeait l'existence, n'indisposait pas, ne soûlait pas. Pourtant, à plusieurs reprises, après des journées de désœuvrement, passées de chantier en chantier, de cabaret en cabaret, il était rentré éméché. Gervaise, ces jours-là, avait fermé sa porte, en prétextant elle-même un gros mal de tête, pour empêcher les Goujet d'entendre les bêtises de Coupeau.","Gervaise had long since returned to work. She no longer had the trouble of removing and replacing the globe of the clock; all the savings were eaten up; and you had to dig hard, dig for four, because there were four mouths at the table. She alone fed everyone. When she heard people pity her, she quickly excused Coupeau. So think! he had suffered so much, it was not surprising, if his character took on sourness! But it would pass with health. And if she was given to understand that Coupeau seemed solid now, that he could well return to the building site, she would cry out. No, no, not yet! She didn't want to have him in bed again. She knew very well what the doctor was telling her, perhaps! It was she who prevented him from working, telling him every morning to take his time, not to force himself. She even slipped him twenty-sou pieces into his waistcoat pocket. Coupeau accepted that as a natural thing; he complained of all kinds of pain to be pampered; after six months, his convalescence was still lasting. Now, on the days when he went to watch the others work, he gladly went in for a drink with the comrades. All the same, it was not bad at the wine merchant's; we laughed, we stayed there for five minutes. It dishonored no one. The installers alone affected to die of thirst at the door. In the past, we were right to joke about it, since a glass of wine never killed a man. But he beat his chest, making it an honor to drink nothing but wine; always wine, never brandy; wine prolonged life, did not indispose, did not make one drunk. However, on several occasions, after days of idleness, spent from building site to building site, from cabaret to cabaret, he had come home tipsy. Gervaise, on those days, had closed her door, claiming a severe headache herself, to prevent the Goujets from hearing Coupeau's nonsense.","Gervaise had long since resumed her work. She no longer lifted the globe of her clock to take out her bankbook; her savings were all gone, and it was necessary to count the sous pretty closely, for there were four mouths to feed, and they were all dependent on the work of her two hands. When anyone found fault with Coupeau and blamed him she always took his part. ""Think how much he has suffered,"" she said with tears in her eyes. "" Think of the shock to his nerves! Who can wonder that he is a little sour? Wait awhile, though, until he is perfectly well, and you will see that his temper will be as sweet as it ever was."" And if anyone ventured to observe that he seemed quite well and that he ought to go to work she would exclaim: ""No indeed, not yet. It would never do. "" She did not want him down in his bed again. She knew what the doctor had said, and she every day begged him to take his own time. She even slipped a little silver, into his vest pocket. All this Coupeau accepted as a matter of course. He complained of all sorts of pains and aches to gain a little longer period of indolence and at the end of six months had begun to look upon himself as a confirmed invalid. He almost daily dropped into a wineshop with a friend; it was a place where he could chat a little, and where was the harm? Besides, whoever heard of a glass of wine killing a man? But he swore to himself that he would never touch anything but wine—not a drop of brandy should pass his lips. Wine was good for one—prolonged one's life, aided digestion—but brandy was a very different matter. Notwithstanding all these wise resolutions, it came to pass more than once that he came in, after visiting a dozen different cabarets, decidedly tipsy. On these occasions Gervaise locked her doors and declared she was ill, to prevent the Goujets from seeing her husband.","Gervaise had for some time past, returned to work. She no longer had the trouble of looking under the glass cover of the clock; all the savings were gone; and she had to work hard, work for four, for there were four to feed now. She alone maintained them. Whenever she heard people pitying her, she at once found excuses for Coupeau. Recollect! He had suffered so much; it was not surprising if his disposition had soured! But it would pass off when his health returned. And if any one hinted that Coupeau seemed all right again, that he could very well return to work, she protested: No, no; not yet! She did not want to see him take to his bed again. They would allow her to know best what the doctor said, perhaps! It was she who prevented him returning to work, telling him every morning to take his time and not to force himself. She even slipped twenty sou pieces into his waistcoat pocket. Coupeau accepted this as something perfectly natural. He was always complaining of aches and pains so that she would coddle him. At the end of six months he was still convalescing. Now, whenever he went to watch others working, he was always ready to join his comrades in downing a shot. It wasn’t so bad, after all. They had their fun, and they never stayed more than five minutes. That couldn’t hurt anybody. Only a hypocrite would say he went in because he wanted a drink. No wonder they had laughed at him in the past. A glass of wine never hurt anybody. He only drank wine though, never brandy. Wine never made you sick, didn’t get you drunk, and helped you to live longer. Soon though, several times, after a day of idleness in going from one building job to another, he came home half drunk. On those occasions Gervaise pretended to have a terrible headache and kept their door closed so that the Goujets wouldn’t hear Coupeau’s drunken babblings."
"- Ah bien ! murmura la vieille femme, ils en crèveront, c'est sûr.","- Ah well ! murmured the old woman, they'll die of it, that's for sure.","""Well! Well! I declare! "" murmured the old woman. ""What will they say to all this?""","murmured the old woman; “that’ll break their hearts, that’s certain.”"
"Tout le monde déclara alors sentir l'orage depuis longtemps. Quand on était sorti de l'église, M. Madinier avait bien vu ce dont il retournait. Lorilleux racontait que ses cors l'avaient empêché de dormir, à partir de trois heures du matin. D'ailleurs, ça ne pouvait pas finir autrement ; voilà trois jours qu'il faisait vraiment trop chaud.","Everyone then declared that they felt the storm for a long time. When we left the church, M. Madinier had seen what he was up to. Lorilleux said that his corns had kept him from sleeping from three o'clock in the morning. Besides, it couldn't end otherwise; it has been really too hot for three days.","Everybody at once declared they had felt the storm coming all the morning. Three days of extreme heat, someone said, always ended in a gust.",Everyone agreed that they knew the storm was coming. It was in the air. Monsieur Madinier said that he had seen it as they were coming out of the church. Lorilleux mentioned that his corns were aching and he hadn’t been able to sleep since three in the morning. A storm was due. It had been much too hot for three days in a row.
"Lui, était républicain ; mais il admirait le prince à cause de son oncle, un homme comme il n'en reviendrait jamais plus. Bibi-la-Grillade se fâcha : il avait travaillé à l'Élysée, il avait vu le Bonaparte comme il voyait Mes-Bottes, là, en face de lui ; eh bien ! ce mufle de président ressemblait à un roussin, voilà ! On disait qu'il allait faire un tour du côté de Lyon ; ce serait un fameux débarras, s'il se cassait le cou dans un fossé. Et, comme la discussion tournait au vilain, Coupeau dut intervenir.","He was a Republican; but he admired the prince because of his uncle, a man like he would never come back from. Bibi-la-Grillade got angry: he had worked at the Elysée, he had seen Bonaparte as he saw My Boots, there, opposite him; well ! that president's muzzle looked like a roussin, that's it! It was said that he was going to take a walk in the direction of Lyons; it would be a terrible riddance if he broke his neck in a ditch. And, as the discussion turned ugly, Coupeau had to intervene.","He was a Republican, and Bibi-la-Grillade and himself were soon in a hot discussion.","He was a republican; but he admired the prince on account of his uncle, a man the like of whom would never be seen again. Bibi-the-Smoker flew into a passion. He had worked at the Elysee; he had seen Bonaparte just as he saw My-Boots in front of him over there. Well that muff of a president was just like a jackass , that was all! It was said that he was going to travel about in the direction of Lyons; it would be a precious good riddance of bad rubbish if he fell into some hole and broke his neck. But, as the discussion was becoming too heated, Coupeau had to interfere."
"Tous poussèrent un cri d'horreur. En voilà un, par exemple, qu'ils seraient allés voir raccourcir avec plaisir ! Non, la guillotine, ce n'était pas assez ; il aurait fallu le couper en petits morceaux. Une histoire d'infanticide les révolta également ; mais le chapelier, très moral, excusa la femme en mettant tous les torts du côté de son séducteur ; car, enfin, si une crapule d'homme n'avait pas fait un gosse à cette malheureuse, elle n'aurait pas pu en jeter un dans les lieux d'aisances. Mais ce qui les enthousiasma, ce furent les exploits du marquis de T ?. sortant d'un bal à deux heures du matin et se défendant contre trois mauvaises gouapes, boulevard des Invalides ; sans même retirer ses gants, il s'était débarrassé des deux premiers scélérats avec des coups de tête dans le ventre, et avait conduit le troisième au poste, par une oreille. Hein ? quelle poigne ! C'était embêtant qu'il fût noble.","They all uttered a cry of horror. Here is one, for example, that they would have gone to see shortened with pleasure! No, the guillotine was not enough; it should have been cut into small pieces. A story of infanticide also revolted them; but the hatter, very moral, excused the woman, putting all the blame on the side of her seducer; for, after all, if a scoundrel of a man hadn't made this unfortunate girl a kid, she wouldn't have been able to throw one into the toilets. But what filled them with enthusiasm were the exploits of the Marquis de T?. coming out of a ball at two o'clock in the morning and defending himself against three bad gouaps, boulevard des Invalides; without even taking off his gloves, he got rid of the first two scoundrels with head butts in the stomach, and led the third to the post, by one ear. Eh ? what a grip! It was annoying that he was noble.","Lantier did not reply instantly, but presently, as the others emptied their glasses, he began to read aloud an account of a frightful murder, to which they listened with eager interest.","They all uttered a cry of horror. There was a fellow whom they would have taken great pleasure in seeing guillotined! No, the guillotine was not enough; he deserved to be cut into little pieces. The story of an infanticide equally aroused their indignation; but the hatter, highly moral, found excuses for the woman, putting all the wrong on the back of her husband; for after all, if some beast of a man had not put the wretched woman into the way of bleak poverty, she could not have drowned it in a water closet. They were most delighted though by the exploit of a Marquis who, coming out of a dance hall at two in the morning, had defended himself against an attack by three blackguards on the Boulevard des Invalides. Without taking off his gloves, he had disposed of the first two villains by ramming his head into their stomachs, and then had marched the third one off to the police. What a man! Too bad he was a noble."
"Elle se leva, alla causer un instant, debout derrière les chaises des petits. Les enfants, ça n'avait pas de raison, ça mangeait toute une journée sans refuser les morceaux ; et elle leur servit elle-même du poulet, un peu de blanc. Mais maman Coupeau dit qu'ils pouvaient bien, pour une fois, se donner une indigestion. Madame Boche, à voix basse, accusa Boche de pincer les genoux de madame Lerat. Oh ! c'était un sournois, il godaillait. Elle avait bien vu sa main disparaître. S'il recommençait, jour de Dieu ! elle était femme à lui flanquer une carafe à la tête.","She got up, went and talked for a moment, standing behind the children's chairs. The children, there was no reason, they ate a whole day without refusing the morsels; and she served them chicken herself, a little white. But Mama Coupeau said that they could well, for once, give themselves indigestion. Madame Boche, in a low voice, accused Boche of pinching Madame Lerat's knees. Oh ! he was sneaky, he joked. She had seen his hand disappear. If he started again, day of God! she was the woman to slap a carafe on his head.",But Mme Coupeau interposed and declared that for once in a while a little fit of indigestion would do them no harm. Mme Boche accused her husband of holding Mme Lerat's hand under the table. Madinier talked politics.,"She got up from her seat, and went and talked for a minute while standing behind the little ones’ chairs. Children did not reason; they would eat all day long without refusing a single thing; and then she herself helped them to some chicken, a little of the breast. But mother Coupeau said they might, just for once in a while, risk an attack of indigestion. Madame Boche, in a low voice accused Boche of caressing Madame Lerat’s knees. Oh, he was a sly one, but he was getting a little too gay. She had certainly seen his hand disappear. If he did it again, drat him! she wouldn’t hesitate throwing a pitcher of water over his head."
"Le lendemain dimanche, dès trois heures, maman Coupeau alluma les deux fourneaux de la maison et un troisième fourneau en terre emprunté aux Boche. A trois heures et demie, le pot-au-feu bouillait dans une grosse marmite, prêtée par le restaurant d'à côté, la marmite du ménage ayant semblé trop petite. On avait décidé d'accommoder la veille la blanquette de veau et l'épinée de cochon, parce que ces plats-là sont meilleurs réchauffés ; seulement, on ne lierait la sauce de la blanquette qu'au moment de se mettre à table. Il resterait encore bien assez de besogne pour le lundi, le potage, les pois au lard, l'oie rôtie. La chambre du fond était tout éclairée par les trois brasiers ; des roux graillonnaient dans les poêlons, avec une fumée forte de farine brûlée ; tandis que la grosse marmite soufflait des jets de vapeur comme une chaudière, les flancs secoués par des glouglous graves et profonds. Maman Coupeau et Gervaise, un tablier blanc noué devant elles, emplissaient la pièce de leur hâte à éplucher du persil, à courir après le poivre et le sel, à tourner la viande avec la mouvette de bois. Elles avaient mis Coupeau dehors pour débarrasser le plancher. Mais elles eurent quand même du monde sur le dos toute l'après-midi. Ça sentait si bon la cuisine, dans la maison, que les voisines descendirent les unes après les autres, entrèrent sous des prétextes, uniquement pour savoir ce qui cuisait ; et elles se plantaient là, en attendant que la blanchisseuse fût forcée de lever les couvercles. Puis, vers cinq heures, Virginie parut ; elle avait encore vu Lantier ; décidément, on ne mettait plus les pieds dans la rue sans le rencontrer. Madame Boche, elle aussi, venait de l'apercevoir au coin du trottoir, avançant la tête d'un air sournois. Alors, Gervaise, qui justement allait acheter un sou d'oignons brûlés pour le pot-au-feu, fut prise d'un tremblement et n'osa plus sortir ; d'autant plus que la concierge et la couturière l'effrayaient beaucoup en racontant des histoires terribles, des hommes attendant des femmes avec des couteaux et des pistolets cachés sous leur redingote. Dame, oui ! on lisait ça tous les jours dans les journaux ; quand un de ces gredins-là enrage de retrouver une ancienne heureuse, il devient capable de tout. Virginie offrit obligeamment de courir chercher les oignons brûlés. Il fallait s'aider entre femmes, on ne pouvait pas laisser massacrer cette pauvre petite. Lorsqu'elle revint, elle dit que Lantier n'était plus là ; il avait dû filer, en se sachant découvert. La conversation, autour des poêlons, n'en roula pas moins sur lui jusqu'au soir. Madame Boche ayant conseillé d'instruire Coupeau, Gervaise montra une grande frayeur et la supplia de ne jamais lâcher un mot de ces choses. Ah bien ! ce serait du propre ! Son mari devait déjà se douter de l'affaire, car depuis quelques jours, en se couchant, il jurait et donnait des coups de poing dans le mur. Elle en restait les mains tremblantes, à l'idée que deux hommes se mangeraient pour elle ; elle connaissait Coupeau, il était jaloux à tomber sur Lantier avec ses cisailles. Et, pendant que, toutes quatre, elles s'enfonçaient dans ce drame, les sauces, sur les fourneaux garnis de cendre, mijotaient doucement ; la blanquette et l'épinée, quand maman Coupeau les découvrait, avaient un petit bruit, un frémissement discret ; le pot-au-feu gardait son ronflement de chantre endormi le ventre au soleil. Elles finirent par se tremper chacune une soupe dans une tasse, pour goûter le bouillon.","The next day, Sunday, at three o'clock, Maman Coupeau lit the two stoves in the house and a third clay stove borrowed from the Boches. At half past three, the pot-au-feu was boiling in a big pot, lent by the restaurant next door, the household pot having seemed too small. We had decided to serve the veal blanquette and pork spine the day before, because these dishes are better reheated; only, the sauce would only be added to the blanquette when it was time to sit down to table. There would still be plenty of work left for Monday, the soup, the peas with bacon, the roast goose. The back chamber was lighted up by the three braziers; roux sizzled in the pans, with a strong smoke of burnt flour; while the big pot blew jets of steam like a boiler, its sides shaking with low, deep gurgles. Maman Coupeau and Gervaise, a white apron tied in front of them, filled the room with their haste in peeling parsley, running after salt and pepper, turning the meat with the wooden skunk. They had put Coupeau out to clear the floor. But they still had people on their backs all afternoon. The kitchen smelled so good in the house that the neighbors came down one after the other, entered under pretexts, just to find out what was cooking; and they stood there, waiting for the laundress to be forced to lift the lids. Then, about five o'clock, Virginie appeared; she had seen Lantier again; decidedly, one no longer set foot in the street without meeting him. Madame Boche, too, had just seen him at the corner of the sidewalk, putting her head forward with a sly air. Then Gervaise, who was just going to buy a sou's worth of burnt onions for the pot-au-feu, was seized with a tremor and dared not go out; especially since the concierge and the seamstress frightened him a great deal by telling terrible stories of men waiting for women with knives and pistols hidden under their frock coats. Lady, yes! we read that every day in the newspapers; when one of these scoundrels is enraged to find a happy old woman, he becomes capable of anything. Virginie obligingly offered to run for the burnt onions. Women had to help each other, we couldn't allow this poor little girl to be massacred. When she returned, she said that Lantier was no longer there; he must have slipped away, knowing that he had been discovered. The conversation, around the saucepans, rolled around him none the less until evening. Madame Boche having advised Coupeau to be instructed, Gervaise showed great fear and begged her never to say a word of these things. Ah well ! that would be clean! Her husband must have already suspected the affair, because for several days, when he went to bed, he had been swearing and punching the wall. She was left with trembling hands at the idea that two men would eat each other for her; she knew Coupeau, he was jealous enough to run into Lantier with his shears. And, while the four of them sank into this drama, the sauces, on the stoves lined with ashes, simmered gently; the blanquette and the spiny, when Maman Coupeau uncovered them, made a little noise, a discreet quivering; the pot-au-feu kept its roar of a cantor asleep, belly in the sun. They ended up dipping each a soup in a cup, to taste the broth.","The next day at three Mamma Coupeau lighted the two furnaces belonging to the house and a third one borrowed from Mme Boche, and at half-past three the soup was gently simmering in a large pot lent by the restaurant at the corner. They had decided to cook the veal and the pork the day previous, as those two dishes could be warmed up so well, and would leave for Monday only the goose to roast and the vegetables. The back shop was ruddy with the glow from the three furnaces—sauces were bubbling with a strong smell of browned flour. Mamma Coupeau and Gervaise, each with large white aprons, were washing celery and running hither and thither with pepper and salt or hurriedly turning the veal with flat wooden sticks made for the purpose. They had told Coupeau pleasantly that his room was better than his company, but they had plenty of people there that afternoon. The smell of the cooking found its way out into the street and up through the house, and the neighbors, impelled by curiosity, came down on all sorts of pretexts, merely to discover what was going on. About five Virginie made her appearance. She had seen Lantier twice. Indeed, it was impossible nowadays to enter the street and not see him. Mme Boche, too, had spoken to him on the corner below. Then Gervaise, who was on the point of going for a sou's worth of fried onions to season her soup, shuddered from head to foot and said she would not go out ever again. The concierge and Virginie added to her terror by a succession of stories of men who lay in wait for women, with knives and pistols hidden in their coats. Such things were read every day in the papers! When such a scamp as Lantier found a woman happy and comfortable, he was always wretched until he had made her so too. Virginie said she would go for the onions. "" Women,"" she observed sententiously, ""should protect each other, as well as serve each other, in such matters. "" When she returned she reported that Lantier was no longer there. The conversation around the stove that evening never once drifted from that subject. Mme Boche said that she, under similar circumstances, should tell her husband, but Gervaise was horror-struck at this and begged her never to breathe one single word about it. Besides, she fancied her husband had caught a glimpse of Lantier from something he had muttered amid a volley of oaths two or three nights before. She was filled with dread lest these two men should meet. She knew Coupeau so well that she had long since discovered that he was still jealous of Lantier, and while the four women discussed the imminent danger of a terrible tragedy the sauces and the meats hissed and simmered on the furnaces, and they ended by each taking a cup of soup to discover what improvement was desirable.","By three o’clock on the morrow, Sunday, mother Coupeau had lighted their two stoves and also a third one of earthenware which they had borrowed from the Boches. At half-past three the pot-au-feu was boiling away in an enormous earthenware pot lent by the eating-house keeper next door, the family pot having been found too small. They had decided to cook the veal and the pig’s back the night before, since both of those dishes are better when reheated. But the cream sauce for the veal would not be prepared until just before sitting down for the feast. There was still plenty of work left for Monday: the soup, the peas with bacon, the roast goose. The inner room was lit by three fires. Butter was sizzling in the pans and emitting a sharp odor of burnt flour. Mother Coupeau and Gervaise, with white aprons tied on, were bustling all around, cleaning parsley, dashing for salt and pepper, turning the meat. They had sent Coupeau away so as not to have him underfoot, but they still had plenty of people looking in throughout the afternoon. The luscious smells from the kitchen had spread through the entire building so that neighboring ladies came into the shop on various pretexts, very curious to see what was being cooked. Virginie put in an appearance towards five o’clock. She had again seen Lantier; really, it was impossible to go down the street now without meeting him. Madame Boche also had just caught sight of him standing at the corner of the pavement with his head thrust forward in an uncommonly sly manner. Then Gervaise who had at that moment intended going for a sou’s worth of burnt onions for the pot-au-feu, began to tremble from head to foot and did not dare leave the house; the more so, as the concierge and the dressmaker put her into a terrible fright by relating horrible stories of men waiting for women with knives and pistols hidden beneath their overcoats. Well, yes! one reads of such things every day in the newspapers. When one of those scoundrels gets his monkey up on discovering an old love leading a happy life he becomes capable of everything. Virginie obligingly offered to run and fetch the burnt onions. Women should always help one another, they could not let that little thing be murdered. When she returned she said that Lantier was no longer there; he had probably gone off on finding he was discovered. In spite of that thought, he was the subject of conversation around the saucepans until night-time. When Madame Boche advised her to inform Coupeau, Gervaise became really terrified, and implored her not to say a word about it. Oh, yes, wouldn’t that be a nice situation! Her husband must have become suspicious already because for the last few days, at night, he would swear to himself and bang the wall with his fists. The mere thought that the two men might destroy each other because of her made her shudder. She knew that Coupeau was jealous enough to attack Lantier with his shears. While the four of them had been deep in contemplating this drama, the saucepans on the banked coals of the stoves had been quietly simmering. When mother Coupeau lifted the lids, the veal and the pig’s back were discreetly bubbling. The pot-au-feu was steadily steaming with snore-like sounds. Eventually each of them dipped a piece of bread into the soup to taste the bouillon."
Chapitre 5,Chapter 5,CHAPTER V,CHAPTER V.
"- Je n'ai rien, souffla-t-elle très bas, oh ! bien vrai, rien du tout. Puis, les yeux refermés, avec un effort :","- I have nothing, she whispered very low, oh! true, nothing at all. Then, eyes closed, with an effort:","""Nothing,"" she said faintly; ""nothing, I assure you!"" Then as her eyes closed she added:","“There’s nothing the matter with me,” she whispered very softly. “Really nothing at all.” Then, closing her eyes again, she added with an effort:"
"- Dans notre métier, il faut des jambes solides.","- In our job, you need strong legs.","""You see, in my trade a man needs a clear head and steady legs.""","He would always say: “In our trade, you have to have steady legs.”"
"Lorsque la sage-femme arriva, un quart d'heure plus tard, ce fut là qu'elle la délivra.","When the midwife arrived, a quarter of an hour later, it was there that she delivered her.","She would not allow her husband to be sent for, and when he came gaily into the room he was welcomed by his pale wife, who whispered to him as he stooped over her:","When the midwife arrived, a quarter of an hour later, she found mother and baby lying there on the floor."
"Tout en marchant très lentement, ils arrivèrent à la mairie une grande demi-heure trop tôt. Et, comme le maire fut en retard, leur tour vint seulement vers onze heures. Ils attendirent sur des chaises, dans un coin de la salle, regardant le haut plafond et la sévérité des murs, parlant bas, reculant leurs sièges par excès de politesse, chaque fois qu'un garçon de bureau passait. Pourtant, à demi-voix, ils traitaient le maire de fainéant ; il devait être pour sûr chez sa blonde, à frictionner sa goutte ; peut-être bien aussi qu'il avait avalé son écharpe. Mais, quand le magistrat parut, ils se levèrent respectueusement. On les fit rasseoir. Alors, ils assistèrent à trois mariages, perdus dans trois noces bourgeoises, avec des mariés en blanc, des fillettes frisées, des demoiselles à ceintures roses, des cortèges interminables de messieurs et de dames sur leur trente-et-un, l'air très comme il faut. Puis, quand on les appela, ils faillirent ne pas être mariés, Bibi-la-Grillade ayant disparu. Boche le retrouva en bas, sur la place, fumant une pipe. Aussi, ils étaient encore de jolis cocos dans cette boîte, de se ficher du monde, parce qu'on n'avait pas de gants beurre frais à leur mettre sous le nez ! Et les formalités, la lecture du Code, les questions posées, la signature des pièces, furent expédiées si rondement, qu'ils se regardèrent, se croyant volés d'une bonne moitié de la cérémonie. Gervaise, étourdie, le cœur gonflé, appuyait son mouchoir sur ses lèvres. Maman Coupeau pleurait à chaudes larmes. Tous s'étaient appliqués sur le registre, dessinant leurs noms en grosses lettres boiteuses, sauf le marié qui avait tracé une croix, ne sachant pas écrire. Ils donnèrent chacun quatre sous pour les pauvres. Lorsque le garçon remit à Coupeau le certificat de mariage, celui-ci, le coude poussé par Gervaise, se décida à sortir encore cinq sous.","While walking very slowly, they arrived at the town hall a good half hour too early. And, as the mayor was late, their turn came only around eleven o'clock. They waited on chairs in a corner of the room, staring at the high ceiling and the harshness of the walls, speaking softly, pushing their seats back out of politeness, each time an office boy passed. Yet, in low tones, they called the mayor lazy; he must have been at his girlfriend's for sure, rubbing her gout; perhaps also that he had swallowed his scarf. But when the magistrate appeared, they rose respectfully. They were made to sit down. So they attended three weddings, lost in three bourgeois weddings, with grooms in white, curly little girls, young ladies in pink sashes, endless processions of gentlemen and ladies in their thirty-one, looking very properly. Then, when they were called, they were almost unmarried, Bibi-la-Grillade having disappeared. Boche found him downstairs, in the square, smoking a pipe. Also, they were still pretty cocos in this box, not to care about the world, because we didn't have fresh butter gloves to put under their noses! And the formalities, the reading of the Code, the questions asked, the signing of the documents, were dispatched so smoothly that they looked at each other, believing themselves robbed of a good half of the ceremony. Gervaise, dazed, her heart swollen, pressed her handkerchief to her lips. Maman Coupeau wept bitterly. All of them had applied themselves to the register, drawing their names in big lame letters, except the groom who had drawn a cross, not knowing how to write. They each gave four sous for the poor. When the waiter handed Coupeau the marriage certificate, the latter, nudged by Gervaise, decided to take out another five sous.","They reached the mayor's office a half-hour too early, and their turn was not reached until nearly eleven. They sat in the corner of the office, stiff and uneasy, pushing back their chairs a little out of politeness each time one of the clerks passed them, and when the magistrate appeared they all rose respectfully. They were bidden to sit down again, which they did, and were the spectators of three marriages—the brides in white and the bridesmaids in pink and blue, quite fine and stylish. When their own turn came Bibi-la-Grillade had disappeared, and Boche hunted him up in the square, where he had gone to smoke a pipe. All the forms were so quickly completed that the party looked at each other in dismay, feeling as if they had been defrauded of half the ceremony. Gervaise listened with tears in her eyes, and the old lady wept audibly. Then they turned to the register and wrote their names in big, crooked letters—all but the newly made husband, who, not being able to write, contented himself with making a cross. Then the clerk handed the certificate to Coupeau. He, admonished by a touch of his wife's elbow, presented him with five sous.","Though they walked very slowly, they arrived at the mayor’s quite half an hour too soon. And as the mayor was late, their turn was not reached till close upon eleven o’clock. They sat down on some chairs and waited in a corner of the apartment, looking by turns at the high ceiling and bare walls, talking low, and over-politely pushing back their chairs each time that one of the attendants passed. Yet among themselves they called the mayor a sluggard, saying he must be visiting his blonde to get a massage for his gout, or that maybe he’d swallowed his official sash. However, when the mayor did put in his appearance, they rose respectfully in his honor. They were asked to sit down again and they had to wait through three other marriages. The hall was crowded with the three bourgeois wedding parties: brides all in white, little girls with carefully curled hair, bridesmaids wearing wide sashes, an endless procession of ladies and gentlemen dressed in their best and looking very stylish. When at length they were called, they almost missed being married altogether, Bibi-the-Smoker having disappeared. Boche discovered him outside smoking his pipe. Well! They were a nice lot inside there to humbug people about like that, just because one hadn’t yellow kid gloves to shove under their noses! And the various formalities—the reading of the Code, the different questions to be put, the signing of all the documents—were all got through so rapidly that they looked at each other with an idea that they had been robbed of a good half of the ceremony. Gervaise, dizzy, her heart full, pressed her handkerchief to her lips. Mother Coupeau wept bitterly. All had signed the register, writing their names in big struggling letters with the exception of the bridegroom, who not being able to write, had put his cross. They each gave four sous for the poor. When an attendant handed Coupeau the marriage certificate, the latter, prompted by Gervaise who nudged his elbow, handed him another five sous."
"Boche disait que les enfants poussaient sur la misère comme les champignons sur le fumier. La portière criait toute la journée, les menaçait de son balai. Elle finit par fermer la porte des caves, parce qu'elle apprit par Pauline, à laquelle elle allongea une paire de calottes, que Nana avait imaginé de jouer au médecin, là-bas dans l'obscurité ; cette vicieuse donnait des remèdes aux autres, avec des bâtons.","Boche said that children grew out of misery like mushrooms out of manure. The doorwoman was screaming all day, threatening them with her broom. She ended up closing the cellar door, because she learned from Pauline, to whom she stretched out a pair of skullcaps, that Nana had imagined playing doctor, over there in the dark; this vicious one gave remedies to others, with sticks.","Boche declared that the children of the poor were as plentiful as mushrooms on a dung heap, and his wife threatened them with her broom.","Boche said that children pushed up out of poverty like mushrooms out of manure. All day long his wife was screaming at them and chasing them with her broom. Finally she had to lock the door of the cellar when she learned from Pauline that Nana was playing doctor down there in the dark, viciously finding pleasure in applying remedies to the others by beating them with sticks."
"Le corbillard révolutionnait le quartier. La tripière appelait les garçons de l'épicier, le petit horloger était sorti sur le trottoir, les voisins se penchaient aux fenêtres. Et tout ce monde causait du lambrequin à franges de coton blanches. Ah ! les Coupeau auraient mieux fait de payer leurs dettes ! Mais, comme le déclaraient les Lorilleux, lorsqu'on a de l'orgueil, ça sort partout et quand même.","The hearse revolutionized the neighborhood. The tripe-maker was calling the grocer's boys, the little watchmaker had gone out onto the sidewalk, the neighbors were leaning out of the windows. And everyone was talking about the lambrequin with white cotton fringes. Ah! the Coupeaus would have done better to pay their debts! But, as the Lorilleux said, when you have pride, it comes out everywhere and all the same.","The hearse was at the door to the great edification of the tradespeople of the neighborhood, who said under their breath that the Coupeaus had best pay their debts. ""It is shameful,"" Gervaise was saying at the same moment, speaking of the Lorilleuxs.","The hearse was creating quite a revolution in the neighborhood. The tripe-seller called to the grocer’s men, the little clockmaker came out on to the pavement, the neighbors leant out of their windows; and all these people talked about the scallop with its white cotton fringe. Ah! the Coupeaus would have done better to have paid their debts. But as the Lorilleuxs said, when one is proud it shows itself everywhere and in spite of everything."
"On parlait à demi-voix, dans le petit jour qui éclairait la pièce par les fentes des volets. La porte du cabinet restait grande ouverte ; et, de cette ouverture béante, sortait le gros silence de la mort. Des rires d'enfants montaient dans la cour, une ronde de gamines tournait, au pâle soleil d'hiver. Tout à coup, on entendit Nana, qui s'était échappée de chez les Boche, où on l'avait envoyée. Elle commandait de sa voix aiguë, et les talons battaient les pavés, tandis que ces paroles chantées s'envolaient avec un tapage d'oiseaux braillards :","We were talking in a low voice, in the early morning which lit up the room through the slits in the shutters. The closet door was wide open; and from this gaping opening issued the heavy silence of death. Children's laughter rose in the yard, a round of little girls turned, in the pale winter sun. Suddenly, we heard Nana, who had escaped from the Boches, where they had sent her. She commanded in her shrill voice, and her heels pounded the cobblestones, while these sung words flew away with the din of braying birds:","He spoke in a low voice, oppressed by the presence of the dead. The children were laughing in the courtyard and Nana singing loudly.","They were talking in lowered voices. Only a dim light came into the room through the cracks in the shutters. The door to the little room stood half open, and from it came the deep silence of death. Children’s laughter echoed in the courtyard. Suddenly they heard the voice of Nana, who had escaped from the Boches to whom she had been sent. She was giving commands in her shrill voice and the children were singing a song about a donkey."
"Que d'embêtements ! A quoi bon se mettre dans tous ses états et se turlupiner la cervelle ? Si elle avait pu pioncer au moins ! Mais sa pétaudière de cambuse lui trottait par la tête. M. Marescot, le propriétaire, était venu lui-même, la veille, leur dire qu'il les expulserait, s'ils n'avaient pas payé les deux termes arriérés dans les huit jours. Eh bien ! il les expulserait, ils ne seraient certainement pas plus mal sur le pavé ! Voyez-vous ce sagouin avec son pardessus et ses gants de laine, qui montait leur parler des termes, comme s'ils avaient eu un boursicot caché quelque part ! Nom d'un chien ! au lieu de se serrer le gaviot, elle aurait commencé par se coller quelque chose dans les badigoinces ! Vrai, elle le trouvait trop rossard, cet entripaillé, elle l'avait où vous savez, et profondément encore ! C'était comme sa bête brute de Coupeau, qui ne pouvait plus rentrer sans lui tomber sur le casaquin : elle le mettait dans le même endroit que le propriétaire. A cette heure, son endroit devait être bigrement large, car elle y envoyait tout le monde, tant elle aurait voulu se débarrasser du monde et de la vie. Elle devenait un vrai grenier à coups de poing. Coupeau avait un gourdin qu'il appelait son éventail à bourrique ; et il éventait la bourgeoise, fallait voir ! des suées abominables, dont elle sortait en nage. Elle, pas trop bonne non plus, mordait et griffait. Alors, on se trépignait dans la chambre vide, des peignées à se faire passer le goût du pain. Mais elle finissait par se ficher des dégelées comme du reste. Coupeau pouvait faire la Saint-Lundi des semaines entières, tirer des bordées qui duraient des mois, rentrer fou de boisson et vouloir la réguiser, elle s'était habituée, elle le trouvait tannant, pas davantage. Et c'était ces jours-là, qu'elle l'avait dans le derrière. Oui, dans le derrière, son cochon d'homme ! dans le derrière, les Lorilleux, les Boche et les Poisson ! dans le derrière, le quartier qui la méprisait ! Tout Paris y entrait, et elle l'y enfonçait d'une tape, avec un geste de suprême indifférence, heureuse et vengée pourtant de le fourrer là.","What annoyance! What's the point of getting all worked up and racking your brains? If only she could pionner at least! But his caboose petaudiere was going around in his head. M. Marescot, the proprietor, had come himself the day before to tell them that he would evict them if they had not paid the two terms in arrears within a week. Well ! he would expel them, they would certainly not be worse off on the pavement! Do you see that sagou with his overcoat and his woolen gloves, who came up to talk to them about the terms, as if they had a bursa hidden somewhere! Name of a dog ! instead of shaking the gaviot, she would have started by sticking something in the whitewash! True, she found him too rossard, this messed up, she had him where you know, and still deeply! It was like her brute Coupeau, which couldn't get in without falling on her casaquin: she put it in the same place as the owner. At this hour, her place must have been damn large, because she was sending everyone there, so much did she want to get rid of the world and of life. She was becoming a real attic with punches. Coupeau had a cudgel which he called his donkey fan; and he was fanning the bourgeois, you had to see! abominable sweats, from which she emerged in a sweat. She, not too good either, bit and scratched. So we stampeded our feet in the empty room, combing hairs to pass off the taste of bread. But she ended up not caring about thaws like anything else. Coupeau could go on Saint-Monday for whole weeks, take sprees that lasted for months, come home mad with drink and want to dress it up, she had got used to it, she found him annoying, no more. And it was on those days that she had it in her behind. Yes, in the behind, his pig man! in the back, the Lorilleux, the Boche and the Poissons! behind, the neighborhood that despised her! All of Paris entered it, and she slapped it down with a gesture of supreme indifference, happy and avenged nonetheless for thrusting it there.","Tired of this contemplation, she got up and took her one chair to the window and looked out into the dingy courtyard. Her landlord had been there that day and declared he would wait only one week for his money, and if it were not forthcoming he would turn them into the street. It drove her wild to see him stand in his heavy overcoat and tell her so coldly that he would pack her off at once. She hated him with a vindictive hatred, as she did her fool of a husband and the Lorilleuxs and Poissons.","What a lot of worry! Though, after all, what was the use of putting herself in such a state and puzzling her brains? If she had only been able to have a snooze. But her hole of a home wouldn’t go out of her mind. Monsieur Marescot, the landlord had come in person the day before to tell them that he would turn them out into the street if the two quarters’ rent now overdue were not paid during the ensuing week. Well, so he might, they certainly couldn’t be worse off on the pavement! Fancy this ape, in his overcoat and his woolen gloves, coming upstairs to talk to them about rent, as if they had had a treasure hidden somewhere! Just the same with that brute of a Coupeau, who couldn’t come home now without beating her; she wished him in the same place as the landlord. She sent them all there, wishing to rid herself of everyone, and of life too. She was becoming a real storehouse for blows. Coupeau had a cudgel, which he called his ass’s fan, and he fanned his old woman. You should just have seen him giving her abominable thrashings, which made her perspire all over. She was no better herself, for she bit and scratched him. Then they stamped about in the empty room and gave each other such drubbings as were likely to ease them of all taste for bread for good. But Gervaise ended by not caring a fig for these thwacks, not more than she did for anything else. Coupeau might celebrate Saint Monday for weeks altogether, go off on the spree for months at a time, come home mad with liquor, and seek to sharpen her as he said , she had grown accustomed to it, she thought him tiresome, but nothing more. It was on these occasions that she wished him somewhere else. Yes, somewhere, her beast of a man and the Lorilleuxs, the Boches, and the Poissons too ; in fact, the whole neighborhood, which she had such contempt for. She sent all Paris there with a gesture of supreme carelessness, and was pleased to be able to revenge herself in this style."
"- Ça ne peut rien vous faire, bien sûr ? Seulement, vous devriez lui conseiller de lâcher cette fille avec laquelle il aura du désagrément.","- It can't do anything to you, of course? Only, you should advise him to let go of this girl with whom he will have trouble.","""Why, nothing, of course; only I should think you would advise him not to have anything to do with such a person.""","“It can’t matter to you, of course. Only, you ought to advise him to break off with that girl, who is sure to cause him some unpleasantness.”"
"Lantier, lui non plus, ne dépérissait pas. Il se soignait beaucoup, mesurait son ventre à la ceinture de son pantalon, avec la continuelle crainte d'avoir à resserrer ou à desserrer la boucle ; il se trouvait très bien, il ne voulait ni grossir ni mincir, par coquetterie. Cela le rendait difficile sur la nourriture, car il calculait tous les plats de façon à ne pas changer sa taille. Même quand il n'y avait pas un sou à la maison, il lui fallait des œufs, des côtelettes, des choses nourrissantes et légères. Depuis qu'il partageait la patronne avec le mari, il se considérait comme tout à fait de moitié dans le ménage ; il ramassait les pièces de vingt sous qui traînaient, menait Gervaise au doigt et à l'œil, grognait, gueulait, avait l'air plus chez lui que le zingueur. Enfin, c'était une baraque qui avait deux bourgeois. Et le bourgeois d'occasion, plus malin, tirait à lui la couverture, prenait le dessus du panier de tout, de la femme, de la table et du reste. Il écrémait les Coupeau, quoi ! Il ne se gênait plus pour battre son beurre en public. Nana restait sa préférée, parce qu'il aimait les petites filles gentilles. Il s'occupait de moins en moins d'Etienne, les garçons, selon lui, devant savoir se débrouiller. Lorsqu'on venait demander Coupeau, on le trouvait toujours là, en pantoufles, en manches de chemise, sortant de l'arrière-boutique avec la tête ennuyée d'un mari qu'on dérange ; et il répondait pour Coupeau, il disait que c'était la même chose.","Lantier, too, was not wasting away. He took great care of himself, measured his belly against the waistband of his trousers, with the continual fear of having to tighten or loosen the buckle; he felt very well, he wanted neither to gain weight nor to lose weight, out of coquetry. This made him picky about food, as he calculated all the dishes so as not to change his height. Even when there was not a penny at home, he needed eggs, chops, nutritious and light things. Since he shared the landlady with the husband, he considered himself to be quite half in the household; he picked up the twenty-sou pieces that were lying around, led Gervaise by the finger and the eye, growled, yelled, seemed more at home than the zinc worker. Finally, it was a barrack which had two bourgeois. And the second-hand bourgeois, smarter, would pull the blanket over him, take the top of the basket of everything, the woman, the table and the rest. He skimmed the Coupeaus, what! He was no longer shy about beating his butter in public. Nana remained his favorite, because he liked nice little girls. He paid less and less attention to Etienne, the boys, according to him, having to know how to manage. When we came to ask for Coupeau, we always found him there, in slippers, in shirt sleeves, coming out of the back room with the bored face of a husband being bothered; and he answered for Coupeau, he said it was the same thing.","Lantier was also in good health and spirits, neither too stout nor too thin. He wished to remain just where he was, for he was thoroughly well satisfied with himself, and this made him critical in regard to his food, as he had made a study of the things he should eat and those he should avoid for the preservation of his figure. Even when there was not a cent he asked for eggs and cutlets: nourishing and light things were what he required, he said. He ruled Gervaise with a rod of iron, grumbled and found fault far more than Coupeau ever did. It was a house with two masters, one of whom, cleverer by far than the other, took the best of everything. He skimmed the Coupeaus, as it were, and kept all the cream for himself. He was fond of Nana because he liked girls better than boys. He troubled himself little about Etienne. When people came and asked for Coupeau it was Lantier who appeared in his shirt sleeves with the air of the man of the house who is needlessly disturbed. He answered for Coupeau, said it was one and the same thing.","Lantier wasn’t wasting away either. He took great care of himself, measuring his stomach by the waist-band of his trousers, with the constant dread of having to loosen the buckle or draw it tighter; for he considered himself just right, and out of coquetry neither desired to grow fatter nor thinner. That made him hard to please in the matter of food, for he regarded every dish from the point of view of keeping his waist as it was. Even when there was not a sou in the house, he required eggs, cutlets, light and nourishing things. Since he was sharing the lady of the house, he considered himself to have a half interest in everything and would pocket any franc pieces he saw lying about. He kept Gervaise running here and there and seemed more at home than Coupeau. Nana was his favorite because he adored pretty little girls, but he paid less and less attention to Etienne, since boys, according to him, ought to know how to take care of themselves. If anyone came to see Coupeau while he was out, Lantier, in shirt sleeves and slippers, would come out of the back room with the bored expression of a husband who has been disturbed, saying he would answer for Coupeau as it was all the same."
"Il y avait aussi une question d'homme par-dessous. On affirmait que Lantier avait quitté Gervaise. Le quartier déclarait ça très bien. Enfin, ça mettait un peu de morale dans la rue. Et tout l'honneur de la séparation revenait à ce finaud de chapelier, que les dames gobaient toujours. On donnait des détails, il avait dû calotter la blanchisseuse pour la faire tenir tranquille, tant elle était acharnée après lui. Naturellement, personne ne disait la vérité vraie ; ceux qui auraient pu la savoir, la jugeaient trop simple et pas assez intéressante. Si l'on voulait, Lantier avait en effet quitté Gervaise, en ce sens qu'il ne la tenait plus à sa disposition, le jour et la nuit ; mais il montait pour sûr la voir au sixième, quand l'envie l'en prenait, car mademoiselle Remanjou le rencontrait sortant de chez les Coupeau à des heures peu naturelles. Enfin, les rapports continuaient, de bric et de broc, va comme je te pousse, sans que l'un ni l'autre y eût beaucoup de plaisir ; un reste d'habitude, des complaisances réciproques, pas davantage. Seulement, ce qui compliquait la situation, c'était que le quartier, maintenant, fourrait Lantier et Virginie dans la même paire de draps. Là encore le quartier se pressait trop. Sans doute, le chapelier chauffait la grande brune ; et ça se trouvait indiqué, puisqu'elle remplaçait Gervaise en tout et pour tout, dans le logement. Il courait justement une blague, on prétendait qu'une nuit il était allé chercher Gervaise sur l'oreiller du voisin, et qu'il avait ramené et gardé Virginie sans la reconnaître avant le petit jour, à cause de l'obscurité. L'histoire faisait rigoler, mais il n'était réellement pas si avancé, il se permettait à peine de lui pincer les hanches. Les Lorilleux n'en parlaient pas moins devant la blanchisseuse des amours de Lantier et de madame Poisson avec attendrissement, espérant la rendre jalouse. Les Boche, eux aussi, laissaient entendre que jamais ils n'avaient vu un plus beau couple. Le drôle, dans tout ça, c'était que la rue de la Goutte-d'Or ne semblait pas se formaliser du nouveau ménage à trois ; non, la morale, dure pour Gervaise, se montrait douce pour Virginie. Peut-être l'indulgence souriante de la rue venait-elle de ce que le mari était sergent de ville.","There was also a man question underneath. It was said that Lantier had left Gervaise. The neighborhood said that very well. Finally, it put a little morality in the street. And all the honor of the separation went to that shrewd hatter, whom the ladies always swallowed. Details were given, he had to slap the laundress to keep her quiet, she was so relentless after him. Of course, no one was telling the real truth; those who could have known it considered it too simple and not interesting enough. If you wanted, Lantier had in fact left Gervaise, in the sense that he no longer kept her at his disposal, day and night; but he was sure to go upstairs to see her when the mood took him, for Mademoiselle Remanjou met him coming out of the Coupeaus' at unnatural hours. Finally, the reports continued, odds and ends, go as I push you, without one or the other having much pleasure; a remnant of habit, reciprocal complacency, nothing more. Only, what complicated the situation was that the neighborhood was now putting Lantier and Virginie in the same pair of sheets. Here again the neighborhood was in too much of a hurry. No doubt the hatter was warming the tall brunette; and that was appropriate, since she was replacing Gervaise in everything and everything, in the accommodation. He was just running a joke, it was said that one night he had gone to look for Gervaise on the neighbor's pillow, and that he had brought and kept Virginie without recognizing her before dawn, because of the darkness. The story was funny, but he really wasn't that advanced, he barely allowed himself to pinch her hips. The Lorilleuxs spoke of it none the less in front of the laundress of the loves of Lantier and Madame Poisson with tenderness, hoping to make her jealous. The Boches, too, hinted that they had never seen a lovelier couple. The funny thing about all this was that the rue de la Goutte-d'Or didn't seem to mind the new threesome; no, morality, harsh for Gervaise, was mild for Virginie. Perhaps the smiling indulgence of the street came from the fact that the husband was a town sergeant.","It was said in the street that Lantier had deserted Gervaise, that she gave him no peace running after him, but this was not true, for he went and came to her apartment as he pleased. Scandal was connecting his name and Virginie's. They said Virginie had taken the clearstarcher's lover as well as her shop! The Lorilleuxs talked of nothing when Gervaise was present but Lantier, Virginie and the shop. Fortunately Gervaise was not inclined to jealousy, and Lantier's infidelities had hitherto left her undisturbed, but she did not accept this new affair with equal tranquillity.","There was also a question of a man beneath all this. It was reported that Lantier had broken off with Gervaise. The neighborhood declared that it was quite right. In short, it gave a moral tone to the street. And all the honor of the separation was accorded to the crafty hatter on whom all the ladies continued to dote. Some said that she was still crazy about him and he had to slap her to make her leave him alone. Of course, no one told the actual truth. It was too simple and not interesting enough. Actually Lantier climbed to the sixth floor to see her whenever he felt the impulse. Mademoiselle Remanjou had often seen him coming out of the Coupeaus’ at odd hours. The situation was even more complicated by neighborhood gossip linking Lantier and Virginie. The neighbors were a bit too hasty in this also; he had not even reached the stage of buttock-pinching with her. Still, the Lorilleuxs delighted in talking sympathetically to Gervaise about the affair between Lantier and Virginie. The Boches maintained they had never seen a more handsome couple. The odd thing in all this was that the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or seemed to have no objection to this new arrangement which everyone thought was progressing nicely."
"Et il raconta comment ils s'étaient rencontrés rue Rochechouart. Après le dîner, Lantier avait refusé une consommation au café de la Boule noire, en disant que, lorsqu'on était marié avec une femme gentille et honnête, on ne devait pas gouaper dans tous les bastringues. Gervaise écoutait avec un petit sourire. Bien sûr, non, elle ne songeait pas à gronder ; elle se sentait trop gênée. Depuis la fête, elle s'attendait bien à revoir son ancien amant un jour ou l'autre ; mais, à pareille heure, au moment de se mettre au lit, l'arrivée brusque des deux hommes l'avait surprise ; et, les mains tremblantes, elle rattachait son chignon roulé dans son cou.","And he told how they had met in the rue Rochechouart. After dinner, Lantier had refused a drink at the Cafe de la Boule Noire, saying that when you were married to a nice and honest woman, you shouldn't gossip in all the bastringues. Gervaise listened with a small smile. Of course not, she wasn't thinking of scolding; she felt too embarrassed. Since the party, she expected to see her former lover again one day or another; but at this hour, just as she was going to bed, the sudden arrival of the two men had surprised her; and, with trembling hands, she fastened her rolled chignon around her neck.","And he went on to say how they had met each other quite by accident in the street and how Lantier had refused to drink with him, saying that when a man had married a nice little woman he had no business to throw away his money in that way. Gervaise listened with a faint smile; she had no idea of scolding. Oh no, it was not worth the trouble, but she was much agitated at seeing the two men together so soon again, and with trembling hands she knotted up her loosened hair.","And he related how they happened to meet in the Rue Rochechouart. After dinner Lantier had declined to have a drink at the “Black Ball,” saying that when one was married to a pretty and worthy little woman, one ought not to go liquoring-up at all the wineshops. Gervaise smiled slightly as she listened. Oh! she was not thinking of scolding , she felt too much embarrassed for that. She had been expecting to see her former lover again some day ever since their dinner party; but at such an hour, when she was about to go to bed, the unexpected arrival of the two men had startled her. Her hands were quivering as she pinned back the hair which had slid down her neck."
"Ces paroles effrayaient Gervaise davantage. Un samedi soir, pourtant, elle céda. Coupeau vint la chercher à huit heures et demie. Elle s'était habillée : une robe noire, avec un châle à palmes jaunes en mousseline de laine imprimée, et un bonnet blanc garni d'une petite dentelle. Depuis six semaines qu'elle travaillait, elle avait économisé les sept francs du châle et les deux francs cinquante du bonnet ; la robe était une vieille robe nettoyée et refaite.","These words frightened Gervaise more. One Saturday evening, however, she gave in. Coupeau came to fetch her at half-past eight. She was dressed: a black dress, with a shawl with yellow leaves in printed wool muslin, and a white bonnet trimmed with a little lace. During the six weeks that she had been working, she had saved the seven francs for the shawl and the two francs fifty for the bonnet; the dress was an old dress cleaned and redone.","These words frightened Gervaise nearly out of her wits. One Saturday evening, however, she consented. Coupeau came for her at half-past eight. She was all ready, wearing a black dress, a shawl with printed palm leaves in yellow and a white cap with fluted ruffles. She had saved seven francs for the shawl and two francs fifty centimes for the cap; the dress was an old one, cleaned and made over.","These words only frightened Gervaise the more. One Saturday evening, however, she gave in. Coupeau came for her at half-past eight. She had dressed herself in a black dress, a crape shawl with yellow palms, and a white cap trimmed with a little cheap lace. During the six weeks she had been working, she had saved the seven francs for the shawl, and the two and a half francs for the cap; the dress was an old one cleaned and made up afresh."
"Puis, lorsque l'ivrogne les avait dépassées, elle se relevait, et toutes le suivaient en pouffant de rire. Il la trouvera ! il ne la trouvera pas ! C'était un vrai jeu de cache-cache. Un jour pourtant, Boche était venu chercher Pauline par les deux oreilles, et Coupeau avait ramené Nana à coups de pied au derrière.","Then, when the drunkard had passed them, she got up, and they all followed him, giggling. He will find her! he won't find her! It was a real game of hide and seek. One day, however, Boche had come to get Pauline by both ears, and Coupeau had brought Nana back with kicks in the behind.","Then the girl would crouch on her knees and bid the others stand close around her, and when he had passed on after an inquiring look she would jump up and they would all utter peals of laughter. But one day Nana was kicked home by her father, and Boche dragged Pauline away by her ear.","Then when the drunkard had passed them she drew herself up again, and all the others followed her with bursts of laughter. He’ll find her—he will—he won’t! It was a true game of hide and seek. One day, however, Boche had come after Pauline and caught her by both ears, and Coupeau had driven Nana home with kicks."
"- Je ne puis pas, comprends-tu ? ? Je vais mourir.","- I can't, do you understand? ? I will die.","""I cannot, for I am dying.""","Then she softly said, “I can’t—do you understand? I’m going to die.”"
"- C'est vous qui le battiez, dit-il enfin. Oh ! vous n'êtes pas bonne ! Vous donnez le fouet au monde.","- You beat him, he said finally. Oh ! you are not good! You whip the world.","Did you beat him?"" he asked finally. "" Oh, you are none too amiable. You beat people sometimes, I have heard.""","“So, you’re the one who beat him,” said he at length. “Oh! you’re not kind. You just go around whipping people.”"
"Il reprit le bout de chaîne, tourna le dos à son tour, en ajoutant comme à regret :","He picked up the end of the chain, turned his back in his turn, adding as if with regret:","He then added as he took up his microscope, ""When the rest of you agree to give five francs per month toward her support we will do the same.","He took up the piece of chain and turned his back also, adding as though with regret:"
"- Ce n'est pas tout ça ? Ce que vous dites et rien, c'est la même chose. La noce aura lieu le samedi 29 juillet. J'ai calculé sur l'almanach. Est-ce convenu ? ça vous va-t-il ?","- Isn't that all? What you say and nothing, it's the same thing. The wedding will take place on Saturday, July 29. I calculated on the almanac. Is it agreed? does it suit you?","""This is all nonsense you are talking! What I want to know is if the day will suit you, July twenty-ninth.""","“All that’s nothing to do with it. What you are talking about isn’t important. The wedding will take place on Saturday, July 29. I calculated by the almanac. Is it settled? Does it suit you?”"
"Puis, dehors, ils n'échangèrent pas un mot. Il ne trouva rien ; il dit seulement qu'elle aurait pu emmener Etienne, s'il n'y avait pas eu encore une demi-heure de travail. Elle s'en allait enfin, quand il la rappela, cherchant à la garder quelques minutes de plus.","Then, outside, they did not exchange a word. He found nothing; he only says that she could have taken Etienne, if there hadn't been half an hour's work yet. She was finally leaving when he called her back, trying to keep her for a few more minutes.","In this way she had paid half the money she had borrowed, when one quarter day, not knowing to whom to turn, as she had not been able to collect her bills punctually, she ran to the Goujets' and borrowed the amount of her rent from them.","Outside, they scarcely exchanged a word. All he could find to say was that she might have taken Etienne away with her, had it not been that there was still another half-hour ’s work to get through. When she started away he called her back, wanting a few more minutes with her."
- Dame ! l'autre a bien voulu la faire cuire !,- Lady ! the other wanted to cook it!,"cried one of the spectators. ""She deserved it,"" answered another, ""for the tall one tried to scald her!""","“Well, the other tried to cook her!”"

It’s in all good fellowship on both sides, is it not? Yes, I accept for the child’s sake.”"
"En arrivant un matin à l'atelier, Clémence raconta qu'elle avait rencontré la veille, vers onze heures, M. Lantier donnant le bras à une femme. Elle disait cela en mots très sales, avec de la méchanceté par-dessous, pour voir la tête de la patronne. Oui, M. Lantier grimpait la rue Notre-Dame-de-Lorette ; la femme était blonde, un de ces chameaux du boulevard à moitié crevés, le derrière nu sous leur robe de soie. Et elle les avait suivis, par blague. Le chameau était entré chez un charcutier acheter des crevettes et du jambon. Puis, rue de La Rochefoucauld, M. Lantier avait posé sur le trottoir, devant la maison, le nez en l'air, en attendant que la petite, montée toute seule, lui eût fait par la fenêtre le signe de la rejoindre. Mais Clémence eut beau ajouter des commentaires dégoûtants, Gervaise continuait à repasser tranquillement une robe blanche. Par moments, l'histoire lui mettait aux lèvres un petit sourire. Ces Provençaux, disait-elle, étaient tous enragés après les femmes ; il leur en fallait quand même ; ils en auraient ramassé sur une pelle dans un tas d'ordures. Et, le soir, quand le chapelier arriva, elle s'amusa des taquineries de Clémence, qui l'intriguait avec sa blonde. D'ailleurs, il semblait flatté d'avoir été aperçu. Mon Dieu ! c'était une ancienne amie, qu'il voyait encore de temps à autre, lorsque ça ne devait déranger personne ; une fille très chic, meublée en palissandre ; et il citait d'anciens amants à elle, un vicomte, un grand marchand de faïence, le fils d'un notaire. Lui, aimait les femmes qui embaument. Il poussait sous le nez de Clémence son mouchoir, que la petite lui avait parfumé, lorsque Etienne rentra. Alors, il prit son air grave, il baisa l'enfant, en ajoutant que la rigolade ne tirait pas à conséquence et que son cœur était mort. Gervaise, penchée sur son ouvrage, hocha la tête d'un air d'approbation. Et ce fut encore Clémence qui porta la peine de sa méchanceté, car elle avait bien senti Lantier la pincer déjà deux ou trois fois, sans avoir l'air, et elle crevait de jalousie de ne pas puer le musc comme le chameau du boulevard.","On arriving at the studio one morning, Clemence related that she had met the day before, around eleven o'clock, M. Lantier giving his arm to a woman. She said that in very dirty words, with wickedness underneath, to see the owner's face. Yes, M. Lantier was climbing the rue Notre-Dame-de-Lorette; the woman was blond, one of those half-dead boulevard camels, her behind bare under her silk dress. And she had followed them, as a joke. The camel had gone to a butcher to buy prawns and ham. Then, in the rue de La Rochefoucauld, Monsieur Lantier had posed on the sidewalk in front of the house, his nose in the air, waiting for the little girl, who had come up alone, to sign to him through the window to join her. But in vain did Clémence add disgusting comments, Gervaise continued to calmly iron a white dress. At times, the story put a small smile on his lips. These Provencals, she said, were all furious with women; they needed it all the same; they would have picked some on a shovel in a pile of garbage. And, in the evening, when the hatter arrived, she amused herself with the teasing of Clemence, who intrigued her with his girlfriend. Besides, he seemed flattered to have been seen. My God ! she was an old friend, whom he still saw from time to time, when it shouldn't bother anyone; a very chic girl, furnished in rosewood; and he mentioned former lovers of hers, a viscount, a great pottery merchant, the son of a notary. He loved women who embalm. He was pushing his handkerchief, which the child had perfumed, under Clemence's nose when Etienne came in. Then he assumed his serious air, he kissed the child, adding that the joke was of no consequence and that his heart was dead. Gervaise, bent over her work, nodded approvingly. And it was Clemence again who bore the brunt of her wickedness, for she had clearly felt Lantier pinch her two or three times already, without appearing, and she was dying of jealousy at not smelling of musk like the camel on the boulevard.","One morning Clémence said that the night before she had seen Lantier walking with a woman who had his arm. Yes, he was coming up La Rue Notre-Dame de Lorette; the woman was a blonde and no better than she should be. Clémence added that she had followed them until the woman reached a house where she went in. Lantier waited in the street until there was a window opened, which was evidently a signal, for he went into the house at once. Gervaise was ironing a white dress; she smiled slightly and said that she believed a Provencal was always crazy after women, and at night when Lantier appeared she was quite amused at Clémence, who at once attacked him. He seemed to be, on the whole, rather pleased that he had been seen. The person was an old friend, he said, one whom he had not seen for some time—a very stylish woman, in fact—and he told Clémence to smell of his handkerchief on which his friend had put some of the perfume she used. Just then Etienne came in, and his father became very grave and said that he was in jest—that his heart was dead. Gervaise nodded approval of this sentiment, but she did not speak. When spring came Lantier began to talk of moving into that neighborhood.","One morning Clemence reported that the previous night, at about eleven o’clock, she had seen Monsieur Lantier with a woman. She told about it maliciously and in coarse terms to see how Gervaise would react. Yes, Monsieur Lantier was on the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette with a blonde and she followed them. They had gone into a shop where the worn-out and used-up woman had bought some shrimps. Then they went to the Rue de La Rochefoucauld. Monsieur Lantier had waited on the pavement in front of the house while his lady friend went in alone. Then she had beckoned to him from the window to join her. No matter how Clemence went on with the story Gervaise went on peacefully ironing a white dress. Sometimes she smiled faintly. These southerners, she said, are all crazy about women; they have to have them no matter what, even if they come from a dung heap. When Lantier came in that evening, Gervaise was amused when Clemence teased him about the blonde. He seemed to feel flattered that he had been seen. Mon Dieu! she was just an old friend, he explained. He saw her from time to time. She was quite stylish. He mentioned some of her former lovers, among them a count, an important merchant and the son of a lawyer. He added that a bit of playing around didn’t mean a thing, his heart was dead. In the end Clemence had to pay a price for her meanness. She certainly felt Lantier pinching her hard two or three times without seeming to do so. She was also jealous because she didn’t reek of musk like that boulevard work-horse."
"- Laisse-la donc tranquille ! répétait Gervaise plus raisonnable. Tu finiras par lui en donner l'envie, à force de lui en parler.","- So leave her alone! repeated Gervaise more reasonably. You will eventually make him want to, by dint of talking to him about it.","""Let her be!"" said Gervaise with all a woman's sense. ""","“Why don’t you leave her alone?” repeated Gervaise, who was more reasonable. “You will end by making her wish to do it by talking to her about it so much.”"
"Elle la fit rentrer dans la boutique, ôta de son doigt son alliance, en disant :","She took her into the shop, took her wedding ring off her finger, saying:","But when Mamma Coupeau had gone a few steps Gervaise called her back into the shop and, taking her wedding ring from her finger, said:","She made her return to the shop, and taking her wedding-ring off her finger said:"
"Nana leva sur sa mère et sur Lantier ses grands yeux clairs, en prenant son air bête, son air du jour de l'an, quand on lui donnait des pastilles de chocolat. Et on n'eut pas besoin de la pousser, bien sûr ; elle trotta en chemise, ses petons nus effleurant à peine le carreau ; elle se glissa comme une couleuvre dans le lit, qui était encore tout chaud, et s'y tint allongée, enfoncée, son corps fluet bossuant à peine la couverture. Chaque fois que sa mère entra, elle la vit les yeux luisants dans sa face muette, ne dormant pas, ne bougeant pas, très rouge et paraissant réfléchir à des affaires.","Nana looked up at her mother and at Lantier with her big bright eyes, putting on her stupid look, her New Year's Day look, when she was given chocolate drops. And we didn't have to push her, of course; she trotted in her nightgown, her bare toes barely touching the tile; she slipped like a snake into the bed, which was still warm, and lay there, lying down, her slender body barely humping the blanket. Every time her mother came in, she saw her with eyes gleaming in her mute face, not sleeping, not moving, very red and seeming to be thinking about business.",Nana looked first at her mother and then at Lantier and then trotted with her little bare feet into the next room and slipped into the bed that was still warm. She lay there wide awake with blazing cheeks and eyes and seemed to be absorbed in thought.,"Nana looked at her mother and Lantier with her big, clear eyes and put on her stupid air, the same as on New Year’s day when anyone made her a present of a box of chocolate candy. And there was certainly no need for them to hurry her. She trotted off in her night-gown, her bare feet scarcely touching the tiled floor; she glided like a snake into the bed, which was still quite warm, and she lay stretched out and buried in it, her slim body scarcely raising the counterpane. Each time her mother entered the room she beheld her with her eyes sparkling in her motionless face—not sleeping, not moving, very red with excitement, and appearing to reflect on her own affairs."
"- Venez, dit-il.","- Come on, he said.",he said.,"“Come,” said he."
"- Oui, je descendais la rue des Martyrs, je regardais une petite qui se tortillait au bras d'un vieux, devant moi, et je me disais : Voilà un troufignon que je connais ? Alors, j'ai redoublé le pas, je me suis trouvé nez à nez avec ma sacrée Nana ? Allez, vous n'avez pas à la plaindre, elle est bien heureuse, une jolie robe de laine sur le dos, une croix d'or au cou, et l'air drolichon avec ça !","- Yes, I was going down the rue des Martyrs, I was looking at a little girl who was squirming on the arm of an old man in front of me, and I said to myself: Here's an asshole I know? So I doubled down, I found myself face to face with my sacred Nana? Come on, you don't have to pity her, she's very happy, a pretty woolen dress on her back, a gold cross around her neck, and she looks funny with it!","""Yes, I was coming down La Rue des Martyrs. In front of me was a young girl on the arm of an old gentleman. As I passed I glanced at her face and assure you that it was Nana. She was well dressed and looked happy.""","“Yes; as I was going down the Rue des Martyrs, I caught sight of a girl who was on the arm of an old fellow in front of me, and I said to myself: I know that shape. I stepped faster and sure enough found myself face to face with Nana. There’s no need to pity her, she looked very happy, with her pretty woolen dress on her back, a gold cross and an awfully pert expression.”"
"Virginie le pinça, mais le chapelier galamment, sans cesser de sourire, lui rendit le bien pour le mal, en faisant la souris le long de son genou, sous le comptoir ; et il retira sa main d'une façon naturelle, lorsque le mari leva la tête, montrant son impériale et ses moustaches rouges, hérissées dans sa face terreuse.","Virginie pinched him, but the hatter gallantly, without ceasing to smile, returned good for evil, smirking along his knee, under the counter; and he withdrew his hand in a natural way, when the husband raised his head, showing his imperial and his red mustaches, bristling in his earthy face.","""By the way,"" said Lantier, addressing himself to Gervaise, ""I saw Nana last night.""",Virginie gave him a pinch and he reached under the counter to run his fingers like a creeping mouse up her leg.
"En remontant se coucher, les Coupeau convinrent que tout avait bien marché et que les Poisson n'étaient pas de méchantes gens. Gervaise trouvait même la boutique proprement arrangée. Elle s'attendait à souffrir, en passant ainsi la soirée dans son ancien logement, où d'autres se carraient à cette heure ; et elle restait surprise de n'avoir pas ragé une seconde. Nana, qui se déshabillait, demanda à sa mère si la robe de la demoiselle du second, qu'on avait mariée le mois dernier, était en mousseline comme la sienne.","Going up to bed, the Coupeaus agreed that everything had gone well and that the Pisces weren't bad people. Gervaise even thought the shop was neatly arranged. She expected to suffer, thus passing the evening in her old lodgings, where others crowded at this hour; and she remained surprised at not having raged for a second. Nana, who was undressing, asked her mother if the dress of the young lady on the second floor, who had been married last month, was in muslin like hers.","Gervaise told Boche that she thought the shop admirably arranged. She had looked forward to an evening of torture and was surprised that she had not experienced a pang. Nana, as she undressed, asked her mother if the girl on the next floor, who had been married the week before, wore a dress of muslin like hers.","On going up to bed, the Coupeaus agreed that everything had passed off well and that the Poissons were not at all bad people. Gervaise even considered the shop was nicely got up. She was surprised to discover that it hadn’t pained her at all to spend an evening there. While Nana was getting ready for bed she contemplated her white dress and asked her mother if the young lady on the third floor had had one like it when she was married last month."
"Et il marcha le premier. Elle le suivit. Tous deux traversèrent le quartier muet, filant sans bruit le long des murs. La pauvre madame Goujet était morte au mois d'octobre, d'un rhumatisme aigu. Goujet habitait toujours la petite maison de la rue Neuve, sombre et seul. Ce jour-là, il s'était attardé à veiller un camarade blessé. Quand il eut ouvert la port ; et allumé une lampe, il se tourna vers Gervaise, restée humblement sur le palier. Il dit très bas, comme si sa mère avait encore pu l'entendre :","And he walked first. She followed him. Both crossed the mute district, slipping noiselessly along the walls. Poor Madame Goujet died in October of acute rheumatism. Goujet still lived in the little house in the rue Neuve, dark and alone. That day he had lingered to watch over a wounded comrade. When he had opened the port; and lit a lamp, he turned to Gervaise, who had remained humbly on the landing. He said very quietly, as if his mother could still hear him:","And he walked on, she following him. Neither spoke. Poor Mme Goujet had died in October of acute rheumatism, and her son continued to reside in the same apartment. He had this night been sitting with a sick friend. He entered, lit a lamp and turned toward Gervaise, who stood humbly on the threshold. ""Come in!"" he said in a low voice, as if his mother could have heard him.","And he walked on first. She followed him. They both crossed the silent district, gliding noiselessly along the walls. Poor Madame Goujet had died of rheumatism in the month of October. Goujet still resided in the little house in the Rue Neuve, living gloomily alone. On this occasion he was belated because he had sat up nursing a wounded comrade. When he had opened the door and lighted a lamp, he turned towards Gervaise, who had remained humbly on the threshold. Then, in a low voice, as if he were afraid his mother could still hear him, he exclaimed, “Come in.”"
"- Non, ça, c'est défendu, dit-il. Mais quand une femme sait se retourner ?","- No, that's forbidden, he said. But when a woman knows how to turn around?","""No, no! Don't do that; it is against the law. But if a woman manages—""","“No, that’s forbidden,” said he. “But when a woman knows how to handle herself—”"
"Ah ! il connaîtrait le plafond, par exemple ; il y avait une fente, au coin de l'alcôve, qu'il aurait dessinée les yeux fermés. Puis, quand il s'installa dans le fauteuil, ce fut une autre histoire. Est-ce qu'il resterait longtemps cloué là, pareil à une momie ? La rue n'était pas si drôle, il n'y passait personne, ça puait l'eau de javelle toute la journée. Non, vrai, il se faisait trop vieux, il aurait donné dix ans de sa vie pour savoir seulement comment se portaient les fortifications. Et il revenait toujours à des accusations violentes contre le sort. Ça n'était pas juste, son accident ; ça n'aurait pas dû lui arriver, à lui, un bon ouvrier, pas fainéant, pas soûlard. A d'autres peut-être, il aurait compris.","Ah! he would know the ceiling, for example; there was a crack in the corner of the alcove that he would have drawn with his eyes closed. Then, when he settled into the chair, it was a different story. Would he stay stuck there for long, like a mummy? The street wasn't so funny, no one was passing by, it stank of bleach all day. No, true, he was getting too old, he would have given ten years of his life just to know how the fortifications were doing. And he always came back to violent accusations against fate. It wasn't fair, his accident; it shouldn't have happened to him, a good worker, not lazy, not drunk. To others perhaps, he would have understood.","He was no philosopher, and he swore from morning until night. He said he knew every crack in the ceiling. When he was installed in his armchair it was little better. How long, he asked impatiently, was he expected to sit there swathed like a mummy? And he cursed his ill luck. His accident was a cursed shame. If his head had been disturbed by drink it would have been different, but he was always sober, and this was the result. He saw no sense in the whole thing!","Ah, he certainly knew the ceiling by heart; there was a crack, at the corner of the alcove, that he could have drawn with his eyes shut. Then, when he was made comfortable in the easy-chair, it was another grievance. Would he be fixed there for long, just like a mummy? Nobody ever passed along the street, so it was no fun to watch. Besides, it stank of bleach water all day. No, he was just growing old; he’d have given ten years of his life just to go see how the fortifications were getting along. He kept going on about his fate. It wasn’t right, what had happened to him. A good worker like him, not a loafer or a drunkard, he could have understood in that case."
- Il est claqué ? Mon Dieu ! quatre jours à gigoter et à gueuler ?,- Is it slammed? My God ! four days of fidgeting and yelling?,"In the meantime Gervaise went directly to Mme Lerat and Mme Lorilleux and said faintly: ""He is dead—after four days of horror.""",“He’s gone. Mon Dieu! Four days’ dancing and yelling—”
"Il ne put achever. Elle s'était levée, en comprenant que Goujet la croyait remise avec Lantier, comme le quartier l'affirmait. Et, les bras tendus, elle cria :","He couldn't finish. She got up, realizing that Goujet thought she was back with Lantier, as the neighborhood claimed. And, arms outstretched, she cried:","He could not finish. She started up, seeing what his convictions were. She cried out: ""You are wrong!","Goujet could not finish the sentence. Gervaise stood up, realizing that he thought she had gone back with Lantier as the neighbors asserted. Stretching her arms toward him, she cried:"
"Gervaise n'avait que vingt-deux ans. Elle était grande, un peu mince, avec des traits fins, déjà tirés par les rudesses de sa vie. Dépeignée, en savates, grelottant sous sa camisole blanche où les meubles avaient laissé de leur poussière et de leur graisse, elle semblait vieillie de dix ans par les heures d'angoisse et de larmes qu'elle venait de passer. Le mot de Lantier la fit sortir de son attitude peureuse et résignée.","Gervaise was only twenty-two. She was tall, a bit slender, with fine features, already strained by the harshness of her life. Uncombed, in slippers, shivering under her white camisole where the furniture had left its dust and grease, she seemed aged ten years by the hours of anguish and tears she had just passed through. Lantier's remark brought her out of her fearful and resigned attitude.","Gervaise was only twenty-two. She was tall and slender with delicate features, already worn by hardships and anxieties. With her hair uncombed and shoes down at the heel, shivering in her white sack, on which was much dust and many stains from the furniture and wall where it had hung, she looked at least ten years older from the hours of suspense and tears she had passed. Lantier's word startled her from her resignation and timidity.","Gervaise was twenty-two, tall and slim with fine features, but she was already beginning to show the strain of her hard life. She seemed to have aged ten years from the hours of agonized weeping. Lantier’s mean remark made her mad."
"Toute la société, avec un fracas de chaises remuées, se mit debout ; les bras se tendirent, les verres se choquèrent, au milieu d'une clameur.","The whole company, with a din of moving chairs, rose to their feet; the arms were stretched out, the glasses clinked, amidst a clamor.","The glasses were filled anew, and Poisson rose and proposed the health of their hostess.","All of them stood up, making a great noise with their chairs as they moved. Holding out their arms, they clinked glasses in the midst of an immense uproar."
"Lantier, le soir, voyant la blanchisseuse ennuyée, lui proposa de la conduire au café-concert, histoire de passer un moment agréable. Elle refusa d'abord, elle n'était pas en train de rire. Sans cela, elle n'aurait pas dit non, car le chapelier lui faisait son offre d'un air trop honnête pour qu'elle se méfiât de quelque traîtrise. Il semblait s'intéresser à son malheur et se montrait vraiment paternel. Jamais Coupeau n'avait découché deux nuits. Aussi, malgré elle, toutes les dix minutes, venait-elle se planter sur la porte, sans lâcher son fer, regardant aux deux bouts de la rue si son homme n'arrivait pas. Ça la tenait dans les jambes, à ce qu'elle disait, des picotements qui l'empêchaient de rester en place. Bien sûr, Coupeau pouvait se démolir un membre, tomber sous une voiture et y rester. elle serait joliment débarrassée, elle se défendait de garder dans le cœur la moindre amitié pour un sale personnage de cette espèce. Mais, à la fin, c'était agaçant de toujours se demander s'il rentrerait ou s'il ne rentrerait pas. Et, lorsqu'on alluma le gaz, comme Lantier lui parlait de nouveau du café-concert, elle accepta. Après tout, elle se trouvait trop bête de refuser un plaisir, lorsque son mari, depuis trois jours, menait une vie de polichinelle. Puisqu'il ne rentrait pas, elle aussi allait sortir. La cambuse brûlerait, si elle voulait. Elle aurait fichu en personne le feu au bazar, tant l'embêtement de la vie commençait à lui monter au nez.","Lantier, in the evening, seeing the bored laundress, offered to drive her to the café-concert, just to have a good time. She refused at first, she wasn't laughing. Otherwise, she wouldn't have said no, because the hatter was making his offer too honestly for her to suspect any treachery. He seemed to take an interest in her misfortune and was really paternal. Coupeau had never slept two nights. So, in spite of herself, every ten minutes, she came and planted herself on the door, without letting go of her iron, looking at both ends of the street to see if her man was coming. It held her in her legs, she said, tingling that prevented her from staying in place. Of course, Coupeau could destroy a limb, fall under a car and stay there. she would be nicely rid of it, she forbade herself to harbor in her heart the slightest friendship for such a filthy personage. But, in the end, it was annoying to always wonder if he would come back or if he wouldn't. And when the gas was turned on, as Lantier was talking to her again about the cafe-concert, she accepted. After all, she thought she was too stupid to refuse a pleasure when her husband had been leading an open life for three days. Since he wasn't coming in, she was going to go out too. The galley would burn, if it wanted. She would have set fire to the mess in person, so much the hassle of life was beginning to get in her face.","Lantier, seeing that Gervaise was out of spirits, proposed that she should go with him to a cafe concert. She refused at first, being in no mood for laughing; otherwise she would have consented, for Lantier's proposal seemed to be prompted by the purest friendliness. He seemed really sorry for her trouble and, indeed, assumed an absolutely paternal air. Coupeau had never stayed away like this before, and she continually found herself going to the door and looking up and down the street. She could not keep to her work but wandered restlessly from place to place. Had Coupeau broken a limb? Had he fallen into the water? She did not think she could care so very much if he were killed, if this uncertainty were over, if she only knew what she had to expect. But it was very trying to live in this suspense. Finally when the gas was lit and Lantier renewed his proposition of the cafe she consented. After all, why should she not go? Why should she refuse all pleasures because her husband chose to behave in this disgraceful way? If he would not come in she would go out. They hurried through their dinner, and as she went out with Lantier at eight o'clock Gervaise begged Nana and Mamma Coupeau to go to bed early.","In the evening Lantier, seeing that the laundress seemed very worried, offered to take her to a music-hall, just by way of passing a pleasant hour or two. She refused at first, she was in no mood for laughing. Otherwise she would not have said, “No,” for the hatter made the proposal in too straightforward a manner for her to feel any mistrust. He seemed to feel for her in quite a paternal way. Never before had Coupeau slept out two nights running. So that in spite of herself, she would go every ten minutes to the door, with her iron in her hand, and look up and down the street to see if her old man was coming. It might be that Coupeau had broken a leg, or fallen under a wagon and been crushed and that might be good riddance to bad rubbish. She saw no reason for cherishing in her heart any affection for a filthy character like him, but it was irritating, all the same, to have to wonder every night whether he would come in or not. When it got dark, Lantier again suggested the music-hall, and this time she accepted. She decided it would be silly to deny herself a little pleasure when her husband had been out on the town for three days. If he wasn’t coming in, then she might as well go out herself. Let the entire dump burn up if it felt like it. She might even put a torch to it herself. She was getting tired of the boring monotony of her present life."
"- C'est bien mal poli ce que vous faites là, mesdemoiselles, dit-elle. On ne se parle jamais tout bas, quand il y a du monde ? Quelque indécence, n'est-ce pas ? Ah ! c'est du propre !","- It's very rude what you're doing there, ladies, she said. Do we ever talk quietly to each other when there are people? Some indecency, isn't it? Ah! it's clean !",Nana listened to the conversation which followed—reveling in indecency—as much at home in it as a fish is in water.,"“That’s very impolite behavior on your part, young ladies,” said she. “It is not right to whisper when other people are present. Something indecent no doubt! Ah! that’s becoming!”"
"Dans la pièce du fond, il venait d'y avoir une bataille furieuse entre Nana et Augustine, à propos de la rôtissoire, que toutes les deux voulaient torcher. Pendant un quart d'heure, la rôtissoire avait rebondi sur le carreau, avec un bruit de vieille casserole. Maintenant, Nana soignait le petit Victor, qui avait un os d'oie dans le gosier ; elle lui fourrait les doigts sous le menton, en le forçant à avaler de gros morceaux de sucre, comme médicament. Ça ne l'empêchait pas de surveiller la grande table. Elle venait à chaque instant demander du vin, du pain, de la viande, pour Etienne et Pauline.","In the back room, there had just been a furious battle between Nana and Augustine, about the rotisserie, which both wanted to torch. For a quarter of an hour, the rotisserie had bounced on the tiled floor, with the sound of an old saucepan. Now Nana was nursing little Victor, who had a goose bone in his throat; she stuck her fingers under his chin, forcing him to swallow large lumps of sugar as medicine. That didn't stop him from watching the big table. She came every moment to ask for wine, bread, meat, for Etienne and Pauline.",They had taken possession of a saucepan and were drumming on it with spoons.,"In the back-room there had just been a furious fight between Nana and Augustine, on account of the Dutch oven, which both wanted to scrape out. For a quarter of an hour, the Dutch oven had rebounded over the tile floor with the noise of an old saucepan. Nana was now nursing little Victor, who had a goose-bone in his throat. She pushed her fingers under his chin, and made him swallow big lumps of sugar by way of a remedy. That did not prevent her keeping an eye on the big table. At every minute she came and asked for wine, bread, or meat, for Etienne and Pauline, she said."
"- Dites donc, vous autres ! est-ce que vous croyez que le linge se repasse tout seul ? ? En voilà des flemmes ! Houp ! à l'ouvrage !","- Say, you people! do you think laundry irons itself? ? Here are the flames! Hoop! at work!","""Do you think the ironing will be done today if you sit still? To work! To work!""",“You ladies! Do you think all these clothes are going to iron themselves? Get to work!”
"Elle eut un faible sourire ; puis, elle murmura :",She smiled weakly; then she whispered:,"""All right!"" said the tinworker, jesting to hide his real emotion.",and it’s all over.” She smiled faintly; then she murmured: “It’s a girl.”
"- De cette pourriture-là, on s'en ficherait volontiers des indigestions. C'est tendre comme du poulet ?",- We wouldn't give a damn about indigestion for that rot. Is it tender like chicken?,"She shook her head slowly, as if in reply to her own thoughts.","“Ah, a man wouldn’t mind getting a bit of indigestion from that sort of rottenness. It’s as tender as chicken.”"
"Au mois de mars, Coupeau rentra un soir trempé jusqu'aux os ; il revenait avec Mes-Bottes de Montrouge, où ils s'étaient flanqué une ventrée de soupe à l'anguille ; et il avait reçu une averse, de la barrière des Fourneaux à la barrière Poissonnière, un fier ruban de queue. Dans la nuit, il fut pris d'une sacrée toux ; il était très rouge, galopé par une fièvre de cheval, battant des flancs comme un soufflet crevé. Quand le médecin des Boche l'eut vu le matin, et qu'il lui eut écouté dans le dos, il branla la tête, il prit Gervaise à part pour lui conseiller de faire porter tout de suite son mari à l'hôpital. Coupeau avait une fluxion de poitrine.","In March, Coupeau came home one evening soaked to the skin; he was returning with Mes-Bottes from Montrouge, where they had stuffed themselves with a belly of eel soup; and he had received a downpour, from the Barrière des Fourneaux to the Barrière Poissonnière, a proud ribbon of tail. During the night he was seized with a terrible cough; he was very red, galloping with horse fever, beating his sides like a burst bellows. When the Boche doctor had seen him in the morning, and had listened behind his back, he shook his head and took Gervaise aside to advise her to have her husband taken to the hospital at once. Coupeau had chest inflammation.","In March Coupeau came in one night drenched to the skin. He had been caught out in a shower. That night he could not sleep for coughing. In the morning he had a high fever, and the physician who was sent for advised Gervaise to send him at once to the hospital.","In the month of March Coupeau returned home one evening soaked through. He had come with My-Boots from Montrouge, where they had stuffed themselves full of eel soup, and he had received the full force of the shower all the way from the Barriere des Fourneaux to the Barriere Poissonniere, a good distance. During the night he was seized with a confounded fit of coughing. He was very flushed, suffering from a violent fever and panting like a broken bellows. When the Boches’ doctor saw him in the morning and listened against his back he shook his head, and drew Gervaise aside to advise her to have her husband taken to the hospital. Coupeau was suffering from pneumonia."
"Cependant, il était une heure, les invités arrivaient. Madame Fauconnier, une femme grasse, belle encore, parut la première ; elle avait une robe écrue, à fleurs imprimées, avec une cravate rose et un bonnet très chargé de fleurs. Ensuite vinrent ensemble mademoiselle Remanjou, toute fluette dans l'éternelle robe noire qu'elle semblait garder même pour se coucher, et le ménage Gaudron, le mari, d'une lourdeur de brute, faisant craquer sa veste brune au moindre geste, la femme, énorme, étalant son ventre de femme enceinte, dont sa jupe, d'un violet cru, élargissait encore la rondeur. Coupeau expliqua qu'il ne faudrait pas attendre Mes-Bottes ; le camarade devait retrouver la noce sur la route de Saint-Denis.","However, it was one o'clock, the guests were arriving. Madame Fauconnier, a fat woman, still beautiful, appeared first; she had on an ecru dress, with printed flowers, with a pink tie and a bonnet heavily laden with flowers. Then came together Mademoiselle Remanjou, all slender in the eternal black dress which she seemed to wear even when going to bed, and the Gaudron household, the husband, with the heaviness of a brute, making his brown jacket creak at the slightest movement, the wife , enormous, spreading out her pregnant belly, the roundness of which her skirt, of a raw purple, enlarged still further. Coupeau explained that they should not wait for My-Boots; the comrade was to meet the wedding party on the road to Saint-Denis.","The guests began to arrive. Mme Fauconnier, stout and handsome, was the first. She wore a percale gown, ecru ground with bright figures, a rose-colored cravat and a bonnet laden with flowers. Then came Mlle Remanjon in her scanty black dress, which seemed so entirely a part of herself that it was doubtful if she laid it aside at night. The Gaudron household followed. The husband, enormously stout, looked as if his vest would burst at the least movement, and his wife, who was nearly as huge as himself, was dressed in a delicate shade of violet which added to her apparent size.","It was now one o’clock and the other guests began to arrive. Madame Fauconnier, a fat woman, still good looking, first put in an appearance; she wore a chintz dress with a flowery pattern, a pink tie and a cap over-trimmed with flowers. Next came Mademoiselle Remanjou, looking very thin in the eternal black dress which she seemed to keep on even when she went to bed; and the two Gaudrons—the husband, like some heavy animal and almost bursting his brown jacket at the slightest movement, the wife, an enormous woman, whose figure indicated evident signs of an approaching maternity and whose stiff violet colored skirt still more increased her rotundity. Coupeau explained that they were not to wait for My-Boots; his comrade would join the party on the Route de Saint-Denis."
"- Vous buvez ! Prenez garde, voyez où mène la boisson ? Un jour ou l'autre, vous mourrez ainsi.","- You drink ! Beware, see where the drink leads? One day or another, you will die like this.","""You drink,"" he repeated, ""and see to what it leads. Someday you will be here, and like this.""",“You drink! Take care; see where drink leads to. One day or other you will die thus.”
"- A propos, dis-moi donc ce que ces demoiselles se sont dit à l'oreille ; tu sais, la saleté de Sophie ?","- By the way, tell me what these young ladies whispered in their ears; you know, Sophie's filth?","The workwomen ate their breakfast on their knees; they were in no hurry, either, to return to their work, when suddenly Leonie uttered a low hiss, and like magic each girl was busy.","“By the way, tell me what the girls were whispering to each other—you know, what Sophie said?”"
"- Faut rester ici, ma vieille, si le cœur t'en dit ? On s'arrangera ?","- Do you have to stay here, old lady, if you feel like it? We will manage ?","""If you like this place so much why don't you stay here? We can make room for you.""","“You must stay here, old boy, if it suits you. It’s easily arranged.”"
"Ce fut aux premières gelées que Nana s'esbigna une fois encore, sous le prétexte d'aller voir chez la fruitière s'il y avait des poires cuites. Elle sentait l'hiver, elle ne voulait pas claquer des dents devant le poêle éteint. Les Coupeau la traitèrent simplement de rosse, parce qu'ils attendaient les poires. Sans doute elle rentrerait ; l'autre hiver, elle était bien restée trois semaines pour descendre chercher deux sous de tabac. Mais les mois s'écoulèrent, la petite ne reparaissait plus. Cette fois, elle avait dû prendre un fameux galop. Lorsque juin arriva, elle ne revint pas davantage avec le soleil. Décidément, c'était fini, elle avait trouvé du pain blanc quelque part. Les Coupeau, un jour de dèche, vendirent le lit de fer de l'enfant, six francs tout ronds qu'ils burent à Saint-Ouen. Ça les encombrait, ce lit.","It was during the first frosts that Nana once again slipped away, under the pretext of going to see if there were any cooked pears at the greengrocer's. She smelled of winter, she didn't want to chatter her teeth in front of the extinguished stove. The Coupeaus simply called her a thug, because they were waiting for the pears. No doubt she would return; the other winter she had been there for three weeks to go down and get two sous' worth of tobacco. But the months passed, the little one never reappeared. This time, she must have taken a famous gallop. When June came, it did not return with the sun either. Decidedly, it was over, she had found white bread somewhere. The Coupeaus, one dry day, sold the child's iron bed for six round francs which they drank at Saint-Ouen. It bothered them, this bed.","One night in the autumn Nana went out, saying she wanted some baked pears from the fruiterer's. She felt the cold weather coming on, and she did not care to sit before a cold stove. The winter before she went out for two sous' worth of tobacco and came back in a month's time; they thought she would do the same now, but they were mistaken. Winter came and went, as did the spring, and even when June arrived they had seen and heard nothing of her. She was evidently comfortable somewhere, and the Coupeaus, feeling certain that she would never return, had sold her bed; it was very much in their way, and they could drink up the six francs it brought.","When the first frosts came Nana took herself off once more under the pretence of going to the fruiterer’s to see if there were any baked pears. She scented winter and didn’t care to let her teeth chatter in front of the fireless stove. The Coupeaus had called her no good because they had waited for the pears. No doubt she would come back again. The other winter she had stayed away three weeks to fetch her father two sous’ worth of tobacco. But the months went by and the girl did not show herself. This time she must have indulged in a hard gallop. When June arrived she did not even turn up with the sunshine. Evidently it was all over, she had found a new meal ticket somewhere or other. One day when the Coupeaus were totally broke they sold Nana’s iron bedstead for six francs, which they drank together at Saint-Ouen. The bedstead had been in their way."
"Mais la jeune femme expliqua qu'elle attendait une personne. Elle retourna vers la rue ; puis, comme Coupeau tardait, elle revint, attirée, regardant encore. La maison ne lui semblait pas laide. Parmi les loques pendues aux fenêtres, des coins de gaieté riaient, une giroflée fleurie dans un pot, une cage de serins d'où tombait un gazouillement, des miroirs à barbe mettant au fond de l'ombre des éclats d'étoiles rondes. En bas, un menuisier chantait, accompagné par les sifflements réguliers de sa varlope ; pendant que, dans l'atelier de serrurerie, un tintamarre de marteaux battant en cadence faisait une grosse sonnerie argentine. Puis, à presque toutes les croisées ouvertes, sur le fond de la misère entrevue, des enfants montraient leurs têtes barbouillées et rieuses, des femmes cousaient, avec des profils calmes penchés sur l'ouvrage. C'était la reprise de la tâche après le déjeuner, les chambres vides des hommes travaillant au-dehors, la maison rentrant dans cette grande paix, coupée uniquement du bruit des métiers, du bercement d'un refrain, toujours le même, répété pendant des heures. La cour seulement était un peu humide. Si Gervaise avait demeuré là, elle aurait voulu un logement au fond, du côté du soleil. Elle avait fait cinq ou six pas, elle respirait cette odeur fade des logis pauvres, une odeur de poussière ancienne, de saleté rance ; mais, comme l'âcreté des eaux de teinture dominait, elle trouvait que ça sentait beaucoup moins mauvais qu'à l'hôtel Boncœur. Et elle choisissait déjà sa fenêtre, une fenêtre dans l'encoignure de gauche, où il y avait une petite caisse, plantée de haricots d'Espagne, dont les tiges minces commençaient à s'enrouler autour d'un berceau de ficelles.","But the young woman explained that she was expecting someone. She returned to the street; then, as Coupeau delayed, she came back, attracted, still looking. The house did not seem ugly to him. Among the rags hanging from the windows, corners of gaiety were laughing, a flowering wallflower in a pot, a cage of canaries from which a chirping fell, shaving mirrors shining round stars in the background of the shadows. Below, a carpenter was singing, accompanied by the regular whistling of his plane; while, in the locksmith's workshop, a din of hammers beating in rhythm made a loud silvery ringing. Then, at almost all the open windows, against the background of the glimpsed misery, children showed their smeared and laughing heads, women were sewing, with calm profiles bent over the work. It was the resumption of work after lunch, the empty rooms of the men working outside, the house returning to this great peace, cut off only from the noise of the trades, from the rocking of a refrain, always the same, repeated during hours. The yard only was a bit damp. If Gervaise had lived there, she would have wanted accommodation at the back, on the sunny side. She had taken five or six steps, she breathed in that insipid odor of poor lodgings, an odor of old dust, of rancid dirt; but, as the pungency of the dyeing waters predominated, she found that it smelled much less bad than at the Hotel Boncoeur. And she was already choosing her window, a window in the left corner, where there was a little crate planted with runner beans, the slender stems of which were beginning to wind around a cradle of string.","But the young woman explained that she was waiting for a friend and then turned back toward the street. As Coupeau still delayed, she returned to the courtyard, finding in it a strange fascination. The house did not strike her as especially ugly. At some of the windows were plants—a wallflower blooming in a pot—a caged canary, who uttered an occasional warble, and several shaving mirrors caught the light and shone like stars. A cabinetmaker sang, accompanied by the regular whistling sounds of his plane, while from the locksmith's quarters came a clatter of hammers struck in cadence. At almost all the open windows the laughing, dirty faces of merry children were seen, and women sat with their calm faces in profile, bending over their work. It was the quiet time—after the morning labors were over and the men were gone to their work and the house was comparatively quiet, disturbed only by the sounds of the various trades. The same refrain repeated hour after hour has a soothing effect, Gervaise thought. To be sure, the courtyard was a little damp. Were she to live there, she should certainly prefer a room on the sunny side. She went in several steps and breathed that heavy odor of the homes of the poor—an odor of old dust, of rancid dirt and grease—but as the acridity of the smells from the dyehouse predominated, she decided it to be far better than the Hôtel Boncoeur. She selected a window—a window in the corner on the left, where there was a small box planted with scarlet beans, whose slender tendrils were beginning to wind round a little arbor of strings.","The young woman explained that she was waiting for a friend. She returned to the street; then as Coupeau did not come, she went back to the courtyard seized with the desire to take another look. She did not think the house ugly. Amongst the rags hanging from the windows she discovered various cheerful touches—a wall-flower blooming in a pot, a cage of chirruping canaries, shaving-glasses shining like stars in the depth of the shadow. A carpenter was singing in his work-shop, accompanied by the whining of his plane. The blacksmith’s hammers were ringing rhythmically. In contrast to the apparent wretched poverty, at nearly every open window appeared the begrimed faces of laughing children. Women with peaceful faces could be seen bent over their sewing. The rooms were empty of men who had gone back to work after lunch. The whole tenement was tranquil except for the sounds from the work-shops below which served as a sort of lullaby that went on, unceasingly, always the same. The only thing she did not like was the courtyard’s dampness. She would want rooms at the rear, on the sunny side. Gervaise took a few more steps into the courtyard, inhaling the characteristic odor of the slums, comprised of dust and rotten garbage. But the sharp odor of the waste water from the dye shop was strong, and Gervaise thought it smelled better here than at the Hotel Boncoeur. She chose a window for herself, the one at the far left with a small window box planted with scarlet runners."
"Le silence régnait, ils n'avaient plus échangé une parole. Lui, semblait attendre. Elle, rongeant sa douleur, s'efforçant d'avoir un visage indifférent, se hâtait. Comme elle faisait un paquet de linge sale jeté dans un coin, derrière la malle, il ouvrit enfin les lèvres, il demanda :","Silence reigned, they had not exchanged a word. He seemed to be waiting. She, gnawing at her pain, trying to put on an indifferent face, hurried on. As she was making a packet of dirty laundry thrown in a corner behind the trunk, he finally opened his lips and asked:","A profound silence reigned in the room; they did not speak to each other. He seemed to be waiting for something. She, adopting an unconcerned air, seemed to be in haste. She made up a bundle of soiled linen that had been thrown into a corner behind the trunk, and then he spoke:","Neither one spoke, they had nothing more to say. Lantier seemed to be waiting, while Gervaise kept busy and tried to keep her countenance expressionless. Finally, while she was making a bundle of the dirty clothes thrown in a corner, behind the trunk, he at length opened his lips and asked:"
"Et elle faillit se laisser enfermer. Il fallut qu'un gardien se mît à sa tête, la reconduisit jusqu'à une porte. Puis, dans la cour du Louvre, lorsqu'elle eut repris ses parapluies au vestiaire, elle respira. M. Madinier retrouvait son aplomb ; il avait eu tort de ne pas tourner à gauche ; maintenant, il se souvenait que les bijoux étaient à gauche. Toute la société, d'ailleurs, affectait d'être contente d'avoir vu ça.","And she almost let herself be locked up. A guard had to put himself at her head, escort her to a door. Then, in the courtyard of the Louvre, when she had taken her umbrellas from the cloakroom, she breathed again. M. Madinier regained his composure; he had been wrong not to turn left; now he remembered that the jewels were on the left. The whole society, moreover, affected to be happy to have seen that.","They meekly followed one of them, and when they were outside they uttered a sigh of relief as they put up their umbrellas once more, but one and all affected great pleasure at having been to the Louvre.","And the wedding party was nearly locked in. An attendant was obliged to place himself at the head of it, and conduct it to a door. Then in the courtyard of the Louvre, when it had recovered its umbrellas from the cloakroom, it breathed again. Monsieur Madinier regained his assurance. He had made a mistake in not turning to the left, now he recollected that the jewelry was to the left. The whole party pretended to be very pleased at having seen all they had."
"Et comme le zingueur recommençait à prêcher, l'autre, qui s'était mis debout, se donna une claque sur la fesse, en criant :","And as the zinc worker began to preach again, the other, who had risen to his feet, slapped himself on the buttock, shouting:","Then Coupeau said they would settle the account, and his friend could do as he pleased afterward.","And as the zinc-worker commenced another sermon, the other, who had risen on his legs, gave himself a slap, exclaiming:"
- Tiens ! saleté ! ? Tu l'as reçu celui-là. Ça te calmera le derrière.,- Take ! dirt ! ? You got that one. It'll calm your ass.,"""Take that!","“There, you scum! You got it that time. It’ll help to cool you.”"
"- Oh ! tu sais, par curiosité ! répondit-elle, en affectant un air d'indifférence. On cherche, on entre à tous les écriteaux, ça n'engage à rien ? Mais celle-là est trop chère, décidément. Puis, ce serait peut-être une bêtise de m'établir. Cependant, après le dîner, elle revint à la boutique du mercier. Elle dessina les lieux, sur la marge d'un journal. Et, peu à peu, elle en causait, mesurait les coins, arrangeait les pièces, comme si elle avait dû, dès le lendemain, y caser ses meubles. Alors, Coupeau la poussa à louer, en voyant sa grande envie ; pour sûr, elle ne trouverait rien de propre, à moins de cinq cents francs ; d'ailleurs, on obtiendrait peut-être une diminution. La seule chose ennuyeuse, c'était d'aller habiter la maison des Lorilleux, qu'elle ne pouvait pas souffrir. Mais elle se fâcha, elle ne détestait personne ; dans le feu de son désir, elle défendit même les Lorilleux ; ils n'étaient pas méchants au fond, on s'entendrait très bien. Et, quand ils furent couchés, Coupeau dormait déjà qu'elle continuait ses aménagements intérieurs, sans avoir pourtant, d'une façon nette, consenti à louer.","- Oh ! you know, out of curiosity! she replied, affecting an air of indifference. We search, we enter all the signs, it does not commit to anything? But this one is definitely too expensive. Then, it would perhaps be foolishness to establish myself. However, after dinner, she returned to the haberdasher's shop. She drew the place, on the margin of a newspaper. And, little by little, she talked about it, measuring the corners, arranging the rooms, as if she had had to put her furniture in them the next day. Then Coupeau urged her to hire, seeing her great desire; for sure, she wouldn't find anything clean for less than five hundred francs; moreover, we might obtain a reduction. The only boring thing was going to live in the Lorilleux's house, which she couldn't bear. But she got angry, she hated no one; in the heat of her desire, she even defended the Lorilleuxs; they weren't bad at heart, we would get along very well. And when they were in bed, Coupeau was already asleep while she was continuing her interior fittings, without however having, in any clear way, consented to renting.","""Yes, I asked it just out of curiosity,"" she answered with an air of indifference, ""but it is too dear, decidedly too dear. It would be unwise, I think, to take it."" But she could talk of nothing else the whole evening. She drew the plan of the rooms on the margin of a newspaper, and as she talked she measured the furniture, as if they were to move the next day. Then Coupeau, seeing her great desire to have the place, declared he would see the owner the next morning, for it was possible he would take less than five hundred francs, but how would she like to live so near his sister, whom she detested? Gervaise was displeased at this and said she detested no one and even defended the Lorilleuxs, declaring they were not so bad, after all. And when Coupeau was asleep her busy brain was at work arranging the rooms which as yet they had not decided to hire.","“Oh! you know, only out of curiosity!” replied she, affecting an air of indifference. “One looks about, and goes in wherever there’s a bill up—that doesn’t bind one to anything. But that shop is altogether too dear. Besides, it would perhaps be foolish of me to set up in business.” However, after dinner, she again referred to the draper’s shop. She drew a plan of the place on the margin of a newspaper. And, little by little, she talked it over, measuring the corners, and arranging the rooms, as though she were going to move all her furniture in there on the morrow. Then Coupeau advised her to take it, seeing how she wanted to do so; she would certainly never find anything decent under five hundred francs; besides they might perhaps get a reduction. He knew only one objection to it and that was living in the same house as the Lorilleux, whom she could not bear. Gervaise declared that she wasn’t mad at anybody. So much did she want her own shop that she even spoke up for the Lorilleuxs, saying that they weren’t mean at heart and that she would be able to get along just fine with them. When they went to bed, Coupeau fell asleep immediately, but she stayed awake, planning how she could arrange the new place even though she hadn’t yet made up her mind completely."
"L'atelier fut pris d'une gaieté sournoise, et madame Lerat dut se montrer sévère. Elle pinça le nez, en murmurant :","The studio was seized with a sly gaiety, and Madame Lerat had to be severe. She pinched her nose, whispering:","""Did you know,"" said Leonie as she picked up a rose leaf with her pincers, ""how wretched poor Caroline is with that fellow who used to call for her regularly every night?""",Madame Lerat had to display severity over the muffled laughter.
"Depuis lors, Gervaise veillait, tâchait d'intervenir, dès qu'elle entendait le père Bijard monter l'escalier. Mais, la plupart du temps, elle attrapait simplement quelque torgnole pour sa part. Dans la journée, quand elle entrait, elle trouvait souvent Lalie attachée au pied du lit de fer ; une idée du serrurier, qui, avant de sortir, lui ficelait les jambes et le ventre avec de la grosse corde, sans qu'on pût savoir pourquoi ; une toquade de cerveau dérangé par la boisson, histoire sans doute de tyranniser la petite, même lorsqu'il n'était plus là. Lalie, raide comme un pieu, avec des fourmis dans les jambes, restait au poteau pendant des journées entières ; même elle y resta une nuit, Bijard ayant oublié de rentrer. Quand Gervaise, indignée parlait de la détacher, elle la suppliait de ne pas déranger une corde, parce que son père devenait furieux, s'il ne retrouvait pas les nœuds faits de la même façon. Vrai, elle n'était pas mal, ça la reposait ; et elle disait cela en souriant, ses courtes jambes de chérubin enflées et mortes. Ce qui la chagrinait, c'était que ça n'avançait guère l'ouvrage, d'être collée à ce lit, en face de la débandade du ménage. Son père aurait bien dû inventer autre chose. Elle surveillait tout de même ses enfants, se faisait obéir, appelait près d'elle Henriette et Jules pour les moucher. Comme elle avait les mains libres, elle tricotait en attendant d'être délivrée, afin de ne pas perdre complètement son temps. Et elle souffrait surtout, lorsque Bijard la déficelait ; elle se traînait un bon quart d'heure par terre, ne pouvant se tenir debout, à cause du sang qui ne circulait plus.","Since then, Gervaise had been watching, trying to intervene whenever she heard Father Bijard coming up the stairs. But, most of the time, she simply caught some hooker for her part. During the day, when she came in, she often found Lalie tied to the foot of the iron bed; an idea of the locksmith, who, before going out, tied up his legs and stomach with heavy rope, without anyone knowing why; a mental infatuation disturbed by the drink, a story no doubt to tyrannize the little one, even when he was no longer there. Lalie, stiff as a stake, with ants in her legs, stayed at the post for whole days; she even stayed there one night, Bijard having forgotten to return. When Gervaise, indignant, spoke of untying her, she begged her not to disturb a rope, because her father would become furious if he did not find the knots made in the same way. True, she was not bad, it rested her; and she said it smiling, her short cherubic legs swollen and dead. What bothered her was that it wasn't making much progress, being glued to this bed, facing the disarray of the household. His father should have invented something else. All the same, she watched her children, made herself obeyed, called Henriette and Jules near her to blow their noses. As she had her hands free, she knitted while waiting to be delivered, so as not to completely waste her time. And she suffered especially when Bijard undid her; she dragged herself for a good quarter of an hour on the ground, unable to stand up because of the blood which had ceased to circulate.","After that Gervaise was on the watch whenever she heard Bijard coming up the stairs. But she never caught him in any act of absolute brutality. Several times she had found Lalie tied to the foot of the bedstead—an idea that had entered her father's brain, no one knew why, a whim of his disordered brain, disordered by liquor, which probably arose from his wish to tyrannize over the child, even when he was no longer there. Lalie sometimes was left there all day and once all night. When Gervaise insisted on untying her the child entreated her not to touch the knots, saying that her father would be furious if he found the knots had been tampered with. And really, she said with an angelic smile, she needed rest, and the only thing that troubled her was not to be able to put the room in order. She could watch the children just as well, and she could think, so that her time was not entirely lost. When her father let her free, her sufferings were not over, for it was sometimes more than an hour before she could stand—before the blood circulated freely in her stiffened limbs.","From that time Gervaise watched and prepared to interfere directly she heard Bijard coming up the stairs. But on most of the occasions she only caught some whack for her trouble. When she entered their room in the day-time, she often found Lalie tied to the foot of the iron bedstead; it was an idea of the locksmith’s, before going out, to tie her legs and her body with some stout rope, without anyone being able to find out why—a mere whim of a brain diseased by drink, just for the sake, no doubt, of maintaining his tyranny over the child when he was no longer there. Lalie, as stiff as a stake, with pins and needles in her legs, remained whole days at the post. She once even passed a night there, Bijard having forgotten to come home. Whenever Gervaise, carried away by her indignation, talked of unfastening her, she implored her not to disturb the rope, because her father became furious if he did not find the knots tied the same way he had left them. Really, it wasn’t so bad, it gave her a rest. She smiled as she said this though her legs were swollen and bruised. What upset her the most was that she couldn’t do her work while tied to the bed. She could watch the children though, and even did some knitting, so as not to entirely waste the time."
"- Suffit ! on est à la hauteur, mon bonhomme ? Les mufes sont des mufes, voilà ! Il tourna le dos, après avoir louché terriblement, en regardant Gervaise. Celle-ci se reculait, un peu effrayée. La fumée des pipes, l'odeur forte de tous ces hommes, montaient dans l'air chargé d'alcool ; et elle étouffait, prise d'une petite toux.","- Enough! are we up to it, my man? Mufes are mufes, that's it! He turned his back, after squinting terribly, looking at Gervaise. She drew back, a little frightened. The smoke from the pipes, the strong smell of all these men, rose in the air laden with alcohol; and she was choking, seized with a little cough.","""Ah, I understand. ' A word to the wise—'"" And he turned round with a fearful lurch to look at Gervaise, who shuddered and recoiled. The tobacco smoke, the odor of humanity added to this air heavy with alcohol, was oppressive, and she choked a little and coughed.","We know what’s what, my boy. Muffs are muffs, that’s all!” He turned his back after leering terribly as he looked at Gervaise. The latter drew back, feeling rather frightened. The smoke from the pipes, the strong odor of all those men, ascended in the air, already foul with the fumes of alcohol; and she felt a choking sensation in her throat, and coughed slightly."

"Une rafale de pluie balayait la chaussée, où des femmes fuyaient en tenant leurs jupes à deux mains.

"Madame Putois, une femme de quarante-cinq ans, maigre, petite, repassait sans une goutte de sueur, boutonnée dans un vieux caraco marron. Elle n'avait pas même retiré son bonnet, un bonnet noir garni de rubans verts tournés au jaune. Et elle restait raide devant l'établi, trop haut pour elle, les coudes en l'air, poussant son fer avec des gestes cassés de marionnette. Tout d'un coup, elle s'écria :","Madame Putois, a forty-five-year-old woman, skinny, short, passed through without a drop of sweat, buttoned up in an old brown camisole. She hadn't even taken off her bonnet, a black bonnet trimmed with green ribbons turned yellow. And she remained stiff in front of the workbench, too high for her, elbows in the air, pushing her iron with the broken gestures of a puppet. Suddenly she exclaimed:","Mine Putois was a thin little woman who looked cool and comfortable in her tightly buttoned dress. She had not taken her cap off but stood at the table, moving her irons to and fro with the regularity of an automaton. Suddenly she exclaimed:","Madame Putois, a thin little woman of forty-five, was ironing. Though she was buttoned up in an old chestnut-colored dress, there was not a drop of perspiration to be seen. She had not even taken her cap off, a black cap trimmed with green ribbons turned partly yellow. And she stood perfectly upright in front of the ironing-table, which was too high for her, sticking out her elbows, and moving her iron with the jerky evolutions of a puppet. On a sudden she exclaimed:"
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a donc ? demanda-t-elle.,- So what is it? she asked.,"She went in. ""What is the matter?"" she said.",“What is the matter?” she asked.
"Peu à peu, Lantier en était venu également à s'occuper des affaires de la famille. Comme les Lorilleux rechignaient toujours pour sortir de leur poche les cent sous de la maman Coupeau, il avait expliqué qu'on pouvait leur intenter un procès. Est-ce qu'ils se fichaient du monde ! c'étaient dix francs qu'ils devaient donner par mois ! Et il montait lui-même chercher les dix francs, d'un air si hardi et si aimable, que la chaîniste n'osait pas les refuser. Maintenant, madame Lerat, elle aussi, donnait deux pièces de cent sous. Maman Coupeau aurait baisé les mains de Lantier, qui jouait en outre le rôle de grand arbitre, dans les querelles de la vieille femme et de Gervaise. Quand la blanchisseuse, prise d'impatience, rudoyait sa belle-mère, et que celle-ci allait pleurer sur son lit, il les bousculait toutes les deux, les forçait à s'embrasser, en leur demandant si elles croyaient amuser le monde avec leurs bons caractères. C'était comme Nana : on l'élevait joliment mal, à son avis. En cela, il n'avait pas tort, car lorsque le père tapait dessus, la mère soutenait la gamine, et lorsque la mère à son tour cognait, le père faisait une scène. Nana, ravie de voir ses parents se manger, se sentant excusée à l'avance, commettait les cent dix-neuf coups. A présent, elle avait inventé d'aller jouer dans la maréchalerie en face ; elle se balançait la journée entière aux brancards des charrettes ; elle se cachait avec des bandes de voyous au fond de la cour blafarde, éclairée du feu rouge de la forge ; et, brusquement, elle reparaissait, courant, criant, dépeignée et barbouillée, suivie de la queue des voyous, comme si une volée de marteaux venait de mettre ces saloperies d'enfants en fuite. Lantier seul pouvait la gronder ; et encore elle savait joliment le prendre. Cette merdeuse de dix ans marchait comme une dame devant lui, se balançait, le regardait de côté, les yeux déjà pleins de vice. Il avait fini par se charger de son éducation : il lui apprenait à danser et à parler patois.","Gradually, Lantier had also come to take care of family affairs. Since the Lorilleuxs were always reluctant to take Mother Coupeau's hundred sous out of their pockets, he had explained that they could be sued. Did they care about the world! they were to give ten francs a month! And he went upstairs himself to get the ten francs, with such a bold and amiable air that the chain-maker dared not refuse them. Now Madame Lerat, too, gave two hundred-sou pieces. Maman Coupeau is said to have kissed the hands of Lantier, who also played the role of grand arbiter in the quarrels between the old woman and Gervaise. When the laundress, seized with impatience, bullied her stepmother, and the latter went to cry on her bed, he jostled them both, forced them to kiss each other, asking them if they thought they were amusing the world with it. their good characters. It was like Nana: she was brought up pretty badly, in her opinion. In that, he was not wrong, because when the father hit it, the mother supported the kid, and when the mother in turn hit, the father made a scene. Nana, delighted to see her parents eat each other, feeling excused in advance, committed the one hundred and nineteen blows. Now she had made up her mind to go and play in the farriery opposite; she rocked the whole day on the stretchers of the carts; she was hiding with bands of hoodlums at the end of the pale courtyard, lit by the red fire of the forge; and suddenly she reappeared, running, shouting, uncombed and smeared, followed by the line of hoodlums, as if a volley of hammers had just put those filthy children to flight. Lantier alone could scold her; and even then she knew how to take it nicely. This shitty ten-year-old walked like a lady in front of him, swayed, looked at him sideways, her eyes already full of vice. He had ended up taking charge of her education: he taught her to dance and speak patois.","By degrees Lantier attended to all those affairs which fall to the share of the master of the house and to various details of their business, in addition. He insisted that if the five francs which the Lorilleux people had agreed to pay toward the support of Mamma Coupeau was not forthcoming they should go to law about it. In fact, ten francs was what they ought to pay. He himself would go and see if he could not make them agree to that. He went up at once and asked them in such a way that he returned in triumph with the ten francs. And Mme Lerat, too, did the same at his representation. Mamma Coupeau could have kissed Lantier's hands, who played the part, besides, of an arbiter in the quarrels between the old woman and Gervaise. The latter, as was natural, sometimes lost patience with the old woman, who retreated to her bed to weep. He would bluster about and ask if they were simpletons, to amuse people with their disagreements, and finally induced them to kiss and be friends once more. He expressed his mind freely in regard to Nana also. In his opinion she was brought up very badly, and here he was quite right, for when her father cuffed her her mother upheld her, and when, in her turn, the mother reproved, the father made a scene. Nana was delighted at this and felt herself free to do much as she pleased. She had started a new game at the farriery opposite. She spent entire days swinging on the shafts of the wagons. She concealed herself, with her troop of followers, at the back of the dark court, redly lit by the forge, and then would make sudden rushes with screams and whoops, followed by every child in the neighborhood, reminding one of a flock of martins or sparrows. Lantier was the only one whose scoldings had any effect. She listened to him graciously. This child of ten years of age, precocious and vicious, coquetted with him as if she had been a grown woman. He finally assumed the care of her education. He taught her to dance and to talk slang!","Little by little Lantier also came to mixing himself up in the affairs of the family. As the Lorilleuxs always grumbled at having to part with the five francs for mother Coupeau, he explained that an action could be brought against them. They must think that they had a set of fools to deal with! It was ten francs a month which they ought to give! And he would go up himself for the ten francs so boldly and yet so amiably that the chainmaker never dared refuse them. Madame Lerat also gave two five-franc pieces now. Mother Coupeau could have kissed Lantier’s hands. He was, moreover, the grand arbiter in all the quarrels between the old woman and Gervaise. Whenever the laundress, in a moment of impatience, behaved roughly to her mother-in-law and the latter went and cried on her bed, he hustled them about and made them kiss each other, asking them if they thought themselves amusing with their bad tempers. And Nana, too; she was being brought up badly, according to his idea. In that he was right, for whenever the father spanked the child, the mother took her part, and if the mother, in her turn, boxed her ears, the father made a disturbance. Nana delighted at seeing her parents abuse each other, and knowing that she was forgiven beforehand, was up to all kinds of tricks. Her latest mania was to go and play in the blacksmith shop opposite; she would pass the entire day swinging on the shafts of the carts; she would hide with bands of urchins in the remotest corners of the gray courtyard, lighted up with the red glare of the forge; and suddenly she would reappear, running and shouting, unkempt and dirty and followed by the troop of urchins, as though a sudden clash of the hammers had frightened the ragamuffins away. Lantier alone could scold her; and yet she knew perfectly well how to get over him. This tricky little girl of ten would walk before him like a lady, swinging herself about and casting side glances at him, her eyes already full of vice. He had ended by undertaking her education: he taught her to dance and to talk patois."
"- Tout le monde dort, dit Gervaise, après avoir sonné trois fois, sans que les Boche eussent tiré le cordon.","""Everyone is asleep,"" said Gervaise, after ringing the bell three times without the Boche pulling the cord.","""Everybody is asleep,"" said Gervaise after she had rung the bell three times.","“Everyone’s asleep,” said Gervaise, after ringing three times without the Boches opening the door."
"Et il remonta à sa chambre. Gervaise, toute tremblante, resta près d'une heure assise au bord de son lit, sans songer à se déshabiller. Elle était touchée, elle trouvait Coupeau très honnête ; car elle avait bien cru un moment que c'était fini, qu'il allait coucher là. L'ivrogne, en bas, sous la fenêtre, avait une plainte plus rauque de bête perdue. Au loin, le violon à la ronde canaille se taisait.","And he went back to his room. Gervaise, all trembling, sat for nearly an hour on the edge of her bed, without thinking of undressing. She was touched, she found Coupeau very honest; for she had thought for a moment that it was over, that he was going to sleep there. The drunkard below, under the window, had a more hoarse complaint of a stray. In the distance, the crooked fiddler was silent.","And he went out of the room. Gervaise, trembling from head to foot, sat for a full hour on the side of her bed without undressing. She was profoundly touched and thought Coupeau very honest and very kind. The tipsy man in the street uttered a groan like that of a wild beast, and the notes of the violin had ceased.","And he went back to his room. Gervaise, all in a tremble, remained seated on the edge of her bed, without thinking of undressing herself for nearly an hour. She was touched; she felt that Coupeau was very honorable; for at one moment she had really thought it was all over, and that he would forget her. The drunkard below, under the window, was now hoarsely uttering the plaintive cry of some lost animal. The violin in the distance had left off its saucy tune and was now silent."
"- Je vous demande pardon, dit-elle.","- I beg your pardon, she said.","""I beg your pardon—""","“I beg your pardon,” she said."
"On complimenta beaucoup la chanteuse, qui s'assit en affectant d'être brisée. Elle demanda à boire quelque chose, parce qu'elle mettait trop de sentiment dans cette chanson-là, et qu'elle avait toujours peur de se décrocher un nerf. Toute la table, cependant, fixait les yeux sur Lantier, assis paisiblement à côté de Coupeau, mangeant déjà la dernière part du gâteau de Savoie, qu'il trempait dans un verre de vin. En dehors de Virginie et de madame Boche, personne ne le connaissait. Les Lorilleux flairaient bien quelque micmac ; mais ils ne savaient pas, ils avaient pris un air pincé. Goujet, qui s'était aperçu de l'émotion de Gervaise, regardait le nouveau venu de travers. Comme un silence gêné se faisait, Coupeau dit simplement :","Many compliments were given to the singer, who sat down, affecting to be broken. She asked for something to drink, because she put too much sentiment into that song, and she was always afraid of getting a nerve. The whole table, however, was staring at Lantier, seated peacefully beside Coupeau, already eating the last slice of the Savoy cake, which he was dipping in a glass of wine. Apart from Virginie and Madame Boche, no one knew him. The Lorilleuxs smelled out some Micmac; but they didn't know, they had looked pinched. Goujet, who had noticed Gervaise's emotion, looked askance at the newcomer. As an awkward silence fell, Coupeau said simply:","When she sang that song, she said, she was always torn to pieces, and it left her nerves in a terrible state. Lantier had been placed at the table by Coupeau and was eating a piece of cake, leisurely dipping it into his glass of wine. With the exception of Mme Boche and Virginie, no one knew him. The Lorilleuxs looked at him with some suspicion, which, however, was very far from the mark. An awkward silence followed, broken by Coupeau, who said simply:","The singer was greatly complimented and she resumed her seat affecting to be quite broken down. She asked for something to drink because she always put too much feeling into that song and she was constantly afraid of straining her vocal chords. Everyone at the table now had their eyes fixed on Lantier who, quietly seated beside Coupeau, was devouring the last piece of Savoy cake which he dipped in his glass of wine. With the exception of Virginie and Madame Boche none of the guests knew him. The Lorilleuxs certainly scented some underhand business, but not knowing what, they merely assumed their most conceited air. Goujet, who had noticed Gervaise’s emotion, gave the newcomer a sour look. As an awkward pause ensued Coupeau simply said:"
"Lui, hocha la tête, en répondant :","He nodded, answering:","""You are not angry now?"" she said entreatingly.",He shook his head as he answered:
"- Oui, continua-t-il la tête basse, nous nous en irions, nous vivrions quelque part, en Belgique si vous voulez ? C'est presque mon pays ? En travaillant tous les deux, nous serions vite à notre aise.","- Yes, he continued with his head down, we would go away, we would live somewhere, in Belgium if you want? It's almost my country? By both working, we would soon be at ease.","""I mean,"" he answered without looking in her face, ""that we two can go away and live in Belgium. It is almost the same to me as home, and both of us could get work and live comfortably.""","“We’ll go live somewhere else, in Belgium, if you wish. With both of us working, we would soon be very comfortable.”"
"- C'est toi, chenillon ? bégaya Gervaise. Ah bien ! ton père va te ramasser !","- Is that you, caterpillar? stammered Gervaise. Ah well ! your father will pick you up!","""Is that you, girl?"" stammered Gervaise. "" Well, your father will settle with you!""","“It’s you, shrimp?” stammered Gervaise. “Ah, well, your father will take care of you.”"
"- La bière est de douze francs, dit-il. Si vous voulez avoir une messe, ce sera dix francs de plus. Enfin, il y a le corbillard, qui se paie suivant les ornements ?","""Beer is twelve francs,"" he said. If you want to have a mass, it will be ten francs more. Finally, there is the hearse, which is paid according to the ornaments?","""The coffin,"" he said, ""is twelve francs, and if you want a Mass, ten francs more. A hearse is paid for according to its ornaments.""","“The coffin is twelve francs,” said he. “If you desire a mass, it will be ten francs more. Then there’s the hearse, which is charged for according to the ornaments.”"
"- Hein ? dit le zingueur en arrivant au palier du premier étage, ça sent joliment la soupe à l'oignon. On a mangé de la soupe à l'oignon pour sûr.","- Eh ? said the zinc worker arriving at the landing on the first floor, it smells nicely of onion soup. We ate onion soup for sure.","""Aha!"" cried the young man as they stopped a moment on the second landing. ""I smell onion soup; somebody has evidently been eating onion soup about here, and it smells good too."" It is true.","“By Jove!” said the zinc-worker as he reached the first floor, smiling, “there’s a strong smell of onion soup. Someone’s having onion soup, I’m sure.”"
- Eh bien ? demanda Coupeau.,- Well ? Coupeau asked.,"""Do you not know that hair?""",“Well?” asked Coupeau.
"- Entrez, répéta plus haut le forgeron.","- Come in, repeated the blacksmith louder.","""Come in,"" repeated Goujet.","“Come in,” repeated the blacksmith in a louder tone."
"- Bibi, veux-tu qu'on t'embauche ? le patron m'a dit d'amener un camarade, si je pouvais.","- Bibi, do you want us to hire you? the boss told me to bring a comrade, if I could.","""Bibi,"" he said, ""come with me; the master told me to bring a comrade if I pleased.""","“Bibi, do you want a job. The boss told me to bring a pal if I could.”"
"Alors, on redemanda du fromage et du pain, on causa sérieusement. Les Poisson prenaient le bail et offraient de répondre des deux termes arriérés. D'ailleurs, Boche acceptait l'arrangement, d'un air d'importance, au nom du propriétaire. Il loua même, séance tenante, un logement aux Coupeau, le logement vacant du sixième, dans le corridor des Lorilleux. Quant à Lantier, mon Dieu ! il voulait bien garder sa chambre, si cela ne gênait pas les Poisson. Le sergent de ville s'inclina, ça ne le gênait pas du tout ; on s'entend toujours entre amis, malgré les idées politiques. Et Lantier, sans se mêler davantage de la cession, en homme qui a conclu enfin sa petite affaire, se confectionna une énorme tartine de fromage de Brie ; il se renversait, il la mangeait dévotement, le sang sous la peau, brûlant d'une joie sournoise, clignant les yeux pour guigner tour à tour Gervaise et Virginie.","So we asked for more cheese and bread, we talked seriously. The Poissons took the lease and offered to answer for the two arrears. Moreover, Boche accepted the arrangement, with an air of importance, in the name of the owner. He even rented, on the spot, a lodging at Coupeau, the vacant lodging on the sixth floor, in the corridor of Lorilleux. As for Lantier, my God! he wanted to keep his room, if that didn't bother the Fishes. The sergent de ville bowed, it didn't bother him at all; we always get along with friends, despite political ideas. And Lantier, without meddling further in the sale, like a man who has finally concluded his little business, made himself an enormous slice of Brie cheese; he leaned back, he ate it devoutly, the blood under his skin, burning with a sly joy, blinking his eyes to peek in turn at Gervaise and Virginie.","Virginie and her husband jumped at this and sent for the concierge, who consented to the arrangement on condition that the new tenants would become security for the two quarters then due. This was agreed upon. The Coupeaus would take a room on the sixth floor near the Lorilleuxs. Lantier said politely that if it would not be disagreeable to the Poissons he should like much to retain his present quarters. The policeman bowed stiffly but with every intention of being cordial and said he decidedly approved of the idea. Then Lantier withdrew from the discussion entirely, watching Gervaise and Virginie out of the corners of his eyes.","Then they ordered some more bread and cheese and talked business. The Poissons took the rest of the lease and agreed to be answerable for the two quarters’ rent overdue. Boche, moreover, pompously agreed to the arrangement in the landlord’s name. He even then and there let a lodging to the Coupeaus—the vacant one on the sixth floor, in the same passage as the Lorilleuxs’ apartment. As for Lantier, well! He would like to keep his room, if it did not inconvenience the Poissons. The policeman bowed; it did not inconvenience him at all; friends always get on together, in spite of any difference in their political ideas. And Lantier, without mixing himself up any more in the matter, like a man who has at length settled his little business, helped himself to an enormous slice of bread and cheese; he leant back in his chair and ate devoutly, his blood tingling beneath his skin, his whole body burning with a sly joy, and he blinked his eyes to peep first at Gervaise, and then at Virginie."
"A dix heures, en se déshabillant, Nana pleura, trépigna. Elle voulait coucher dans le lit de maman Coupeau. Sa mère essaya de lui faire peur ; mais la petite était trop précoce, les morts lui causaient seulement une grosse curiosité ; si bien que, pour avoir la paix, on finit par lui permettre de s'allonger à la place de maman Coupeau. Elle aimait les grands lits, cette gamine ; elle s'étalait, elle se roulait. Cette nuit-là, elle dormit joliment bien, dans la bonne chaleur et les chatouilles du matelas de plume.","At ten o'clock, while undressing, Nana wept, stampeded her feet. She wanted to sleep in mother Coupeau's bed. His mother tried to scare him; but the little one was too precocious, the dead only aroused great curiosity in her; so much so that, to have peace of mind, they ended up allowing him to lie down instead of mother Coupeau. She liked big beds, this kid; it spread out, it rolled up. That night, she slept pretty well, in the good warmth and the tickles of the feather mattress.","At ten o'clock, when Nana was undressed, she wept, begging that she might be allowed to sleep in her grandmother's bed. Her mother vaguely wondered that the child was not afraid and allowed her to do as she pleased. Nana was not timid by nature, and only her curiosity, not her fears, had been excited by the events of the last three days, and she curled herself up with delight in the soft, warm feather bed.","At ten o’clock, when undressing, Nana cried and stamped. She wanted to sleep in mother Coupeau’s bed. Her mother tried to frighten her; but the child was too precocious. Corpses only filled her with a great curiosity; so that, for the sake of peace, she was allowed to lie down in mother Coupeau’s place. She liked big beds, the chit; she spread herself out and rolled about. She slept uncommonly well that night in the warm and pleasant feather bed."
"- Tiens, en voilà une, dit Lorilleux à sa femme, en lui donnant le bout de chaîne auquel il travaillait depuis le déjeuner. Tu peux la dresser.","""Here, here's one,"" said Lorilleux to his wife, giving her the piece of chain he had been working on since lunch. You can train it.","The heat was suffocating; the door could not be opened, because the slightest draft gave Lorilleux a cold.","“Look, here’s one,” said Lorilleux to his wife, giving her the piece of chain he had been working on since his lunch. “You can trim it.”"
"- Oui, reprit Gervaise embarrassée par leur silence, je me trouvais en course, j'étais sortie ?","- Yes, resumed Gervaise embarrassed by their silence, I was in the race, I was out?","""Yes,"" said Gervaise after a long silence. ""I have been on a long walk, and I came out—""","“Yes,” Gervaise said, “I had an errand to do, and so I came out.”"
"- Sont-ils indignes, ces crapules-là ! criait madame Boche. Vraiment, il faut que les gens aient bien peu de chose à faire, pour faire tant d'enfants ? Et ça se plaint encore de n'avoir pas de pain !","- Are they unworthy, these scoundrels! shouted Madame Boche. Really, people must have very little to do to have so many children? And it still complains of having no bread!","Boche declared that the children of the poor were as plentiful as mushrooms on a dung heap, and his wife threatened them with her broom.","“Aren’t they abominable, those little toads?” cried Madame Boche. “Really, people can have but very little to do to have time to get so many brats. And yet they complain of having no bread.”"
"En prononçant ces derniers mots, elle traça en l'air une croix, comme pour sceller à jamais son serment. Et, désireuse de rompre la conversation, elle parut s'éveiller en sursaut, elle cria aux ouvrières :","As she spoke these last words, she traced a cross in the air, as if to seal her oath forever. And, desirous of breaking off the conversation, she seemed to wake up with a start, she cried to the workers:","As she uttered these last words she traced a cross in the air to seal her oath, and as if desirous to put an end to the conversation, she called out to her women:","Desiring to break off this conversation, she seemed to awake with a start and called out to the women:"

Merci ! si le linge n'est même plus propre ?","- Oh! you lose your hand nicely. We can no longer give you compliments every day? Yes, you bitch, you screw up the work, at this hour?

""No one can praise your washing nowadays. There is not a piece here that is not dirtied by the iron. Look at this shirt: it is scorched, and the buttons are fairly torn off by the root. Everything comes back—that comes at all, I should say—with the buttons off. Look at that sack: the dirt is all in it. No, no, I can't pay for such washing as this!""","“Ah! you don’t get them up nearly so well as you used to do. One can’t compliment you every day now.

I don’t know how you manage it, but there’s never a button left on anything. Oh! now, here’s a petticoat body which I shall certainly not pay you for. Look there!

"Elle était là, à la rencontre du boulevard extérieur et des boulevards de Magenta et d'Ornano, rêvant de se coucher par terre, lorsqu'elle entendit un bruit de pas.

Enfin elle aperçut les larges épaules d'un homme, une tache sombre et dansante, s'enfonçant dans un brouillard. Oh ! celui-là, elle le voulait, elle ne le lâcherait pas !

She ran, but the snow blocked her eyes, and the steps moved away, without her being able to grasp whether they were going to the right or to the left. Finally she caught sight of a man's broad shoulders, a dark, dancing speck, sinking into a mist. Oh ! this one she wanted, she wouldn't let go! And she ran harder, she reached him, took him by the blouse.","Suddenly an absolute whirlwind struck her and bore her breathless and helpless along—she did not even know in what direction. When at last she was able to open her eyes she could see nothing through the blinding snow, but she heard a step and saw the outlines of a man's figure. She snatched him by the blouse.","She was standing where the outer Boulevard meets the Boulevards Magenta and Ornano, thinking of lying down on the ground, when suddenly she heard a footfall. She began to run, but the snow blinded her, and the footsteps went off without her being able to tell whether it was to the right or to the left. At last, however, she perceived a man’s broad shoulders, a dark form which was disappearing amid the snow. Oh! she wouldn’t let this man get away. And she ran on all the faster, reached him, and caught him by the blouse: “Sir, sir, just listen.”"
"- On ne vous demande rien, finit par répondre Gervaise. Lorsque je devrais me vendre moi-même, je ne veux avoir aucun reproche à me faire. J'ai nourri maman Coupeau sans vous, je l'enterrerai bien sans vous ? Déjà une fois, je ne vous l'ai pas mâché : je ramasse les chats perdus, ce n'est pas pour laisser votre mère dans la crotte.","- We're not asking you anything, finally answers Gervaise. When I should be selling myself, I don't want to have anything to blame myself for. I fed Mama Coupeau without you, will I bury her well without you? Already once, I haven't chewed it up for you: I pick up lost cats, it's not to leave your mother in the poop.","""Very well,"" replied Gervaise, ""I will. I have taken care of your mother while she was living; I can bury her now that she is dead.""","“No one asks you for anything,” Gervaise ended by answering. “Even though I should have to sell myself, I’ll not have anything to reproach myself with. I’ve fed mother Coupeau without your help, and I can certainly bury her without your help also. I already once before gave you a bit of my mind; I pick up stray cats, I’m not likely to leave your mother in the mire.”"
Toutes les laveuses parlaient ensemble.,All the washers were talking together.,Virginie fell to the ground.,All the women spoke together.
"Ce devait être le samedi après le terme, quelque chose comme le 12 ou le 13 janvier, Gervaise ne savait plus au juste. Elle perdait la boule, parce qu'il y avait des siècles qu'elle ne s'était rien mis de chaud dans le ventre. Ah ! quelle semaine infernale ! un ratissage complet, deux pains de quatre livres le mardi qui avaient duré jusqu'au jeudi, puis une croûte sèche retrouvée la veille, et pas une miette depuis trente-six heures, une vraie danse devant le buffet ! Ce qu'elle savait, par exemple, ce qu'elle sentait sur son dos, c'était le temps de chien, un froid noir, un ciel barbouillé comme le cul d'une poêle, crevant d'une neige qui s'entêtait à ne pas tomber. Quand on a l'hiver et la faim dans les tripes, on peut serrer sa ceinture, ça ne vous nourrit guère.","It must have been the Saturday after the term, something like January 12 or 13, Gervaise didn't know exactly. She was losing her mind, because it had been centuries since she had put anything warm in her stomach. Ah! what a hellish week! a complete sweep, two four-pound loaves on Tuesday which had lasted until Thursday, then a dry crust found the day before, and not a crumb for thirty-six hours, a real dance in front of the buffet! What she knew, for example, what she felt on her back, was terrible weather, a black cold, a sky smeared like the bottom of a frying pan, dripping with stubborn snow. not to fall. When you have winter and hunger in your guts, you can tighten your belt, it hardly feeds you.","CHAPTER XII POVERTY AND DEGRADATION The weather was intensely cold about the middle of January. Gervaise had not been able to pay her rent, due on the first. She had little or no work and consequently no food to speak of. The sky was dark and gloomy and the air heavy with the coming of a storm.","It must have been the Saturday after quarter day, something like the 12th or 13th of January —Gervaise didn’t quite know. She was losing her wits, for it was centuries since she had had anything warm in her stomach. Ah! what an infernal week! A complete clear out. Two loaves of four pounds each on Tuesday, which had lasted till Thursday; then a dry crust found the night before, and finally not a crumb for thirty-six hours, a real dance before the cupboard! What did she know, by the way, what she felt on her back, was the frightful cold, a black cold, the sky as grimy as a frying-pan, thick with snow which obstinately refused to fall. When winter and hunger are both together in your guts, you may tighten your belt as much as you like, it hardly feeds you."
"- T'es rincé, mon vieux, crièrent les autres à Coupeau.","- You're flushed, old man, shouted the others to Coupeau.","By this time the wine was exhausted, and they called for more.","“You’re out of luck, comrade,” the others told Coupeau."
"Elle avait rougi légèrement, en balbutiant la fin de la phrase. Elle craignait de laisser voir le plaisir qu'elle prenait à repasser elle-même les chemises de Goujet. Bien sûr, elle n'avait pas de pensées sales ; mais elle n'en était pas moins un peu honteuse.","She blushed slightly, stammering the end of the sentence. She was afraid of showing the pleasure she took in ironing Goujet's shirts herself. Of course, she had no dirty thoughts; but none the less she was a little ashamed.",She colored as she spoke.,"She slightly blushed as she stammered out the last words. She was afraid of showing the great pleasure she took in ironing Goujet’s shirts. She certainly had no wicked thoughts, but she was none the less a little bit ashamed."
"Les premiers jours, Gervaise le gêna beaucoup. Puis, en quelques semaines, il s'habitua à elle. Il la guettait pour lui monter ses paquets, la traitait en sœur, avec une brusque familiarité, découpant des images à son intention. Cependant, un matin, ayant tourné la clef sans frapper, il la surprit à moitié nue, se lavant le cou ; et, de huit jours, il ne la regarda pas en face, si bien qu'il finissait par la faire rougir elle-même.","For the first few days, Gervaise bothered him a great deal. Then, within a few weeks, he got used to her. He watched her to show her his parcels, treated her like a sister, with sudden familiarity, cutting out pictures for her. However, one morning, having turned the key without knocking, he surprised her half-naked, washing her neck; and for eight days he did not look her in the face, so much so that he ended by making her blush herself.","At first he took no interest in Gervaise, but after a while he began to like her and treated her like a sister, with abrupt familiarity.","In the early days of their acquaintance, Gervaise embarrassed him immensely. Then in a few weeks he became accustomed to her. He watched for her that he might carry up her parcels, treated her as a sister, with an abrupt familiarity, and cut out pictures for her. One morning, however, having opened her door without knocking, he beheld her half undressed, washing her neck; and, for a week, he did not dare to look her in the face, so much so that he ended by making her blush herself."
"Le médecin la regardait de son œil perçant. Il reprit, de sa voix brutale :","The doctor looked at her with his piercing eye. He resumed, in his brutal voice:",The surgeon looked at her and said coldly:,The doctor looked at her with his piercing eye. He resumed in his rough voice:
"- Vous savez, dit-il, je vois l'hôtel Boncœur, quand je suis là-haut ? Hier, vous étiez à la fenêtre, j'ai fait aller les bras, mais vous ne m'avez pas aperçu.","- You know, he said, I see the Hotel Boncoeur when I'm up there? Yesterday you were at the window, I stretched out my arms, but you didn't see me.","""Do you know,"" he said, ""when I am up there I can see the Hôtel Boncoeur. Yesterday you were at the window, and I waved my hand, but you did not see me.""","“You know,” said he, “I can see the Hotel Boncoeur when I’m up there. Yesterday you were at the window, and I waved my arms, but you didn’t notice me.”"
"- Dis donc, la flâne ! est-ce que tu te crois à la campagne ! dit Coupeau furieux. Tu es comme M. Béranger, tu composes des vers, peut-être ! ? Veux-tu bien me donner les fers ! A-t-on jamais vu ! se balader sur les toits ! Amène-z-y ta connaissance tout de suite, pour lui chanter des mamours ? Veux-tu me donner les fers, sacrée andouille !","- Say, stroll! do you think you are in the countryside! said Coupeau furiously. You are like M. Béranger, you compose verses, perhaps! ? Will you give me irons! Have we ever seen! walk on the roofs! Bring your acquaintance there right away, to sing him loves? Will you give me irons, sacred sausage!","The boy was taking a walk, apparently, with his scanty blond hair blowing all about his head. ""Do you think you are in the country?"" cried Coupeau in a fury. ""You are another Béranger, perhaps—composing verses! Will you have the kindness to give me my irons? Whoever heard the like? Give me my irons, I say!""","“I say, lazy bones! Do you think you’re having a day in the country?” asked Coupeau, in a rage. “You’re like Monsieur Beranger, composing verses, perhaps! Will you give me those irons! Did any one ever see such a thing! Strolling about on the house-tops! Why not bring your sweetheart at once, and tell her of your love? Will you give me those irons?"
"On acheva le café, en discutant ça. Après tout, c'était possible, il se passait des choses encore plus fortes. Et, dans le quartier, les gens les mieux posés finirent par répéter que Gervaise avait vendu sa fille.","We finished the coffee, discussing it. After all, it was possible, even stronger things were happening. And, in the neighborhood, the most settled people ended up repeating that Gervaise had sold her daughter.","They finished their coffee. This tale might or might not be true; it was not improbable, at all events. And after this it was circulated and generally believed in the Quartier that Gervaise had sold her daughter.","They discussed the scandal thoroughly while finishing their coffee. Yes, it was quite possible. Soon most of the neighborhood accepted the conclusion that Gervaise had actually sold her daughter."
"Justement, le mois était très fort, le compte qu'elles venaient d'arrêter ensemble se montait à dix francs sept sous. Madame Goujet la regarda un moment d'un air sérieux. Puis, elle répondit :","In fact, the month was very strong, the account they had just settled together amounted to ten francs seven sous. Madame Goujet looked at her seriously for a moment. Then she replied:","The account this month was larger than usual, ten francs and over. Mme Goujet looked at her gravely. ""My child,"" she said slowly, ""it shall be as you wish.","It so happened that that month was a very heavy one, the account they had made up together amounting to ten francs, seven sous. Madame Goujet looked at her a moment in a serious manner, then she replied:"
"Elle raconta d'autres tueries, elle ne tarissait pas sur le ménage, savait des choses à faire dresser les cheveux sur la tête. Gervaise écoutait toute cette histoire, sans un mot, la face pâle, avec un pli nerveux aux coins des lèvres qui ressemblait à un petit sourire. Depuis bientôt sept ans, elle n'avait plus entendu parler de Lantier. Jamais elle n'aurait cru que le nom de Lantier, ainsi murmuré à son oreille, lui causerait une pareille chaleur au creux de l'estomac. Non, elle ne se savait pas une telle curiosité de ce que devenait ce malheureux, qui s'était si mal conduit avec elle. Elle ne pouvait plus être jalouse d'Adèle, maintenant ; mais elle riait tout de même en dedans des raclées du ménage, elle voyait le corps de cette fille plein de bleus, et ça la vengeait, ça l'amusait. Aussi serait-elle restée là jusqu'au lendemain matin, à écouter les rapports de Virginie. Elle ne posait pas de questions, parce qu'elle ne voulait pas paraître intéressée tant que ça. C'était comme si, brusquement, on comblait un trou pour elle ; son passé, à cette heure, allait droit à son présent.","She told of other killings, she couldn't stop cleaning, she knew things to make your hair stand on end. Gervaise listened to the whole story, without a word, her face pale, with a nervous crease at the corners of her lips which resembled a small smile. For almost seven years she had not heard of Lantier. She would never have believed that the name of Lantier, thus whispered in her ear, would cause such heat in the pit of her stomach. No, she didn't know she was so curious about what had become of this unfortunate man, who had behaved so badly with her. She couldn't be jealous of Adele anymore; but she laughed all the same inside the beatings of the household, she saw the girl's body full of bruises, and that avenged her, that amused her. So she would have stayed there until the next morning, listening to Virginie's reports. She didn't ask questions, because she didn't want to appear that much interested. It was as if, suddenly, a hole was being filled for her; his past, at this hour, went straight to his present.","She talked on and on, telling things that were enough to make the hair stand up on one's head. Gervaise listened, as pale as death, with a nervous trembling of her lips which might have been taken for a smile. For seven years she had never heard Lantier's name, and she would not have believed that she could have felt any such overwhelming agitation. She could no longer be jealous of Adèle, but she smiled grimly as she thought of the blows she had received in her turn from Lantier, and she would have listened for hours to all that Virginia had to tell, but she did not ask a question for some time.","Oh, she knew of things that would make your hair stand up. Gervaise listened in silence, her face pale. It was nearly seven years since she had heard a word about Lantier. She hadn’t realized what a strong curiosity she had as to what had become of the poor man, even though he had treated her badly. And she never would have believed that just the mention of his name could put such a glowing warmth in the pit of her stomach. She certainly had no reason to be jealous of Adele any more but she rejoiced to think of her body all bruised from the beatings. She could have listened to Virginie all night, but she didn’t ask any questions, not wanting to appear much interested. Virginie stopped to sip at her coffee."
"Mais, à cette voix enrouée, Gervaise s'éveilla comme d'un cauchemar. Qu'avait-elle fait ? elle avait tapé à la cloison, bien sûr. Alors ce fut un vrai coup de bâton sur ses reins, le trac lui serra les fesses, elle recula en croyant voir les grosses mains du croque-mort passer au travers du mur pour la saisir par la tignasse. Non, non, elle ne voulait pas, elle n'était pas prête. Si elle avait frappé, ce devait être avec le coude, en se retournant, sans en avoir l'idée. Et une horreur lui montait des genoux aux épaules, à la pensée de se voir trimbaler entre les bras du vieux, toute raide, la figure blanche comme une assiette.","But, at this hoarse voice, Gervaise awoke as if from a nightmare. What had she done? she had knocked on the wall, of course. Then it was a real blow to her loins, stage fright squeezed her buttocks, she stepped back, thinking she saw the undertaker's big hands pass through the wall to grab her by the mop of hair. No, no, she didn't want to, she wasn't ready. If she had knocked, it must have been with her elbow, turning around, without realizing it. And a horror rose from his knees to his shoulders, at the thought of seeing himself lugging around in the old man's arms, quite stiff, his face as white as a plate.","But at his voice Gervaise awoke as from a nightmare. What had she done? Had she really tapped? she asked herself, and she recoiled from his side of the wall in chill horror. It seemed to her that she felt the undertaker's hands on her head. No! No! She was not ready. She told herself that she had not intended to call him. It was her elbow that had knocked the wall accidentally, and she shivered from head to foot at the idea of being carried away in this man's arms. ""What is the matter?"" repeated Bazonge. ""Can I serve you in any way, madame?""","But the sound of this husky voice awoke Gervaise as though from a nightmare. And a feeling of horror ascended from her knees to her shoulders at the thought of seeing herself lugged along in the old fellow’s arms, all stiff and her face as white as a china plate."
"- Mais laisse-la donc, cette enfant ! elle est gentille, elle ne fait rien de mal.","- But leave her, this child! she's nice, she doesn't do anything wrong.","""Let the child alone!"" she said. ""She is doing no harm!""","“Do leave the child alone! She’s very good , she’s doing no harm.”"
"Mais quand M. Madinier, qui voulait avoir affaire au patron, eut demandé le marchand de vin, la société resta saisie, en entendant celui-ci dire avec un sourire que ça ne faisait pas du tout son compte. Il y avait des suppléments. Et, comme ce mot de « supplément » était accueilli par des exclamations furibondes, il donna le détail : vingt-cinq litres, au lieu de vingt, nombre convenu à l'avance ; les œufs à la neige, qu'il avait ajoutés, en voyant le dessert un peu maigre ; enfin un carafon de rhum, servi avec le café, dans le cas où des personnes aimeraient le rhum. Alors, une querelle formidable s'engagea. Coupeau, pris à partie, se débattait : jamais il n'avait parlé de vingt litres ; quant aux œufs à la neige, ils rentraient dans le dessert, tant pis si le gargotier les avait ajoutés de son plein gré ; restait le carafon de rhum, une frime, une façon de grossir la note, en glissant sur la table des liqueurs dont on ne se méfiait pas.","But when M. Madinier, who wanted to have business with the boss, had asked for the wine merchant, the company was taken aback, hearing him say with a smile that it didn't suit him at all. There were supplements. And, as this word ""supplement"" was greeted with furious exclamations, he gave the details: twenty-five liters, instead of twenty, the number agreed upon in advance; the eggs with snow, which he had added, seeing the dessert was a little lean; finally a decanter of rum, served with the coffee, in case people would like rum. Then a formidable quarrel ensued. Coupeau, taken to task, struggled: he had never spoken of twenty litres; as for the snow eggs, they were part of the dessert, too bad if the restaurant owner had added them of his own free will; there remained the decanter of rum, a show, a way of adding to the bill, by slipping unsuspecting liqueurs onto the table.","But when M. Madinier sent for the proprietor the little assembly were shocked at hearing him say that this was not all; there were ""extras."" As this was received with exclamations of rage, he went into explanations. He had furnished twenty-five liters of wine instead of twenty, as he agreed. The floating island was an addition, on seeing that the dessert was somewhat scanty, whereupon ensued a formidable quarrel.","But when Monsieur Madinier, who wished to deal direct with the landlord, had got him to step up, the whole party became lost in astonishment on hearing him say with a smile that there was still something due to him. There were some extras; and, as the word “extras” was greeted with angry exclamations, he entered into details:—Twenty-five quarts of wine, instead of twenty, the number agreed upon beforehand; the frosted eggs, which he had added, as the dessert was rather scanty; finally, a quarter of a bottle of rum, served with the coffee, in case any one preferred rum. Then a formidable quarrel ensued. Coupeau, who was appealed to, protested against everything; he had never mentioned twenty quarts; as for the frosted eggs, they were included in the dessert, so much the worse for the landlord if he choose to add them without being asked to do so. There remained the rum, a mere nothing, just a mode of increasing the bill by putting on the table spirits that no one thought anything about."
"- Et ne pas être battue, ajouta Coupeau gaiement. Mais je ne vous battrais pas, moi, si vous vouliez, madame Gervaise ? Il n'y a pas de crainte, je ne bois jamais, puis je vous aime trop ? Voyons, c'est pour ce soir, nous nous chaufferons les petons.","""And not be beaten,"" Coupeau added cheerfully. But I wouldn't beat you, if you wanted to, Madame Gervaise? There is no fear, I never drink, then I love you too much? Come on, it's for tonight, we'll warm our feet.","""And not be beaten,"" added Coupeau gaily. ""But I will promise never to beat you, Madame Gervaise, if you will agree to what I ask. I will promise also never to drink, because I love you too much! Come now, say yes.""","“And never to be beaten,” added Coupeau gaily. “But I would never beat you, if you would only try me, Madame Gervaise. You’ve no cause for fear. I don’t drink and then I love you too much. Come, shall it be marriage? I’ll get you divorced and make you my wife.”"
"Maman Coupeau n'osa jamais parler de ça nettement. Mais, après une dispute, quand la blanchisseuse l'avait secouée, la vieille ne ménageait pas les allusions. Elle disait connaître des hommes joliment bêtes et des femmes joliment coquines ; et elle mâchait d'autres mots plus vifs, avec la verdeur de parole d'une ancienne giletière. Les premières fois, Gervaise l'avait regardée fixement, sans répondre. Puis, tout en évitant elle aussi de préciser, elle se défendit, par des raisons dites en général. Quand une femme avait pour homme un soûlard, un saligaud qui vivait dans la pourriture, cette femme était bien excusable de chercher de la propreté ailleurs. Elle allait plus loin, elle laissait entendre que Lantier était son mari autant que Coupeau, peut-être même davantage. Est-ce qu'elle ne l'avait pas connu à quatorze ans ? est-ce qu'elle n'avait pas deux enfants de lui ? Eh bien ! dans ces conditions, tout se pardonnait, personne ne pouvait lui jeter la pierre. Elle se disait dans la loi de la nature. Puis, il ne fallait pas qu'on l'ennuyât. Elle aurait vite fait d'envoyer à chacun son paquet. La rue de la Goutte-d'Or n'était pas si propre ! La petite madame Vigouroux faisait la cabriole du matin au soir dans son charbon. Madame Lehongre, la femme de l'épicier, couchait avec son beau-frère, un grand baveux qu'on n'aurait pas ramassé sur une pelle. L'horloger d'en face, ce monsieur pincé, avait failli passer aux assises, pour une abomination : il allait avec sa propre fille, une effrontée qui roulait les boulevards. Et, le geste élargi, elle indiquait le quartier entier, elle en avait pour une heure rien qu'à étaler le linge sale de tout ce peuple, les gens couchés comme des bêtes, en tas, pères, mères, enfants, se roulant dans leur ordure. Ah ! elle en savait, la cochonnerie pissait de partout, ça empoisonnait les maisons d'alentour ! Oui, oui, quelque chose de propre que l'homme et la femme, dans ce coin de Paris, où l'on est les uns sur les autres, à cause de la misère ! On aurait mis les deux sexes dans un mortier, qu'on en aurait tiré pour toute marchandise de quoi fumer les cerisiers de la plaine Saint-Denis.","Mama Coupeau never dared speak of that clearly. But, after an argument, when the laundress had shaken her, the old woman did not spare the allusions. She said she knew pretty stupid men and pretty naughty women; and she chewed other more lively words, with the liveliness of a former cardigan. The first few times, Gervaise had stared at her without answering. Then, while also avoiding specifics, she defended herself, for reasons said in general. When a woman had a drunkard as a man, a bastard who lived in rot, this woman was quite excusable for seeking cleanliness elsewhere. She went further, she implied that Lantier was her husband as much as Coupeau, perhaps even more. Hadn't she known him when she was fourteen? didn't she have two children by him? Well ! under these conditions, everything was forgiven, no one could throw stones at him. She said she was in the law of nature. Then, we mustn't bother him. She would quickly send everyone their package. Rue de la Goutte-d'Or was not so clean! Little Madame Vigouroux capered from morning till night in her charcoal. Madame Lehongre, the grocer's wife, slept with her brother-in-law, a big slobber who wouldn't have been picked up on a shovel. The watchmaker opposite, that tight-lipped gentleman, had almost gone to the assizes, for an abomination: he was going with his own daughter, a cheeky one who drove the boulevards. And, with a broad gesture, she pointed out the entire neighborhood, she had to spend an hour just spreading out the dirty laundry of all these people, the people lying like animals, in a heap, fathers, mothers, children, rolling in their garbage. Ah! she knew it, the junk pissed everywhere, it poisoned the surrounding houses! Yes, yes, something proper that the man and the woman, in this corner of Paris, where one is on top of the other, because of misery! We would have put the two sexes in a mortar, which we would have taken from it for any merchandise with which to smoke the cherry trees of the Saint-Denis plain.","Mamma Coupeau never dared to speak out openly to the clearstarcher, but after a dispute she was unsparing in her hints and allusions. The first time Gervaise fixed her eyes on her and heard all she had to say in profound silence. Then without seeming to speak of herself, she took occasion to say not long afterward that when a woman was married to a man who was drinking himself to death a woman was very much to be pitied and by no means to blame if she looked for consolation elsewhere. Another time, when taunted by the old woman, she went still further and declared that Lantier was as much her husband as was Coupeau—that he was the father of two of her children. She talked a little twaddle about the laws of nature, and a shrewd observer would have seen that she—parrotlike—was repeating the words that some other person had put into her mouth. Besides, what were her neighbors doing all about her? They were not so extremely respectable that they had the right to attack her. And then she took house after house and showed her mother-in-law that while apparently so deaf to gossip she yet knew all that was going on about her. Yes, she knew—and now seemed to gloat over that which once had shocked and revolted her.","Mother Coupeau never dared speak openly of it. But after a quarrel, when the laundress had bullied her, the old woman was not sparing in her allusions. She would say that she knew men who were precious fools and women who were precious hussies, and she would mutter words far more biting, with the sharpness of language pertaining to an old waistcoat-maker. The first time this had occurred Gervaise looked at her straight in the face without answering. Then, also avoiding going into details, she began to defend herself with reasons given in a general sort of way. When a woman had a drunkard for a husband, a pig who lived in filth, that woman was to be excused if she sought for cleanliness elsewhere. Once she pointed out that Lantier was just as much her husband as Coupeau was. Hadn’t she known him since she was fourteen and didn’t she have children by him? Anyway, she’d like to see anyone make trouble for her. She wasn’t the only one around the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or. Madame Vigouroux, the coal-dealer had a merry dance from morning to night. Then there was the grocer’s wife, Madame Lehongre with her brother-in-law. Mon Dieu! What a slob of a fellow. He wasn’t worth touching with a shovel."
- En voilà un sale voyou !,- Here is a dirty thug!,The youth slipped away and was lost in the crowd.,"Thereupon the young man dived into the midst of the crowd, muttering: “What a dirty blackguard!”"
"A partir de ce jour, madame Lerat se régala de la première histoire de sa nièce. Elle ne la lâchait plus, l'accompagnait matin et soir, en mettant en avant sa responsabilité. Ça ennuyait bien un peu Nana ; mais ça la gonflait tout de même, d'être gardée comme un trésor ; et les conversations quelles avaient dans les rues toutes les deux, avec le fabricant de boutons derrière elles, l'échauffaient et lui donnaient plutôt l'envie de faire le saut. Oh ! sa tante comprenait le sentiment ; même le fabricant de boutons, ce monsieur âgé déjà et si convenable, l'attendrissait, car enfin le sentiment chez les personnes mûres a toujours des racines plus profondes. Seulement, elle veillait. Oui, il lui passerait plutôt sur le corps avant d'arriver à la petite. Un soir, elle s'approcha du monsieur et lui envoya raide comme balle que ce qu'il faisait là n'était pas bien. Il la salua poliment, sans répondre, en vieux rocantin habitué aux rebuffades des parents. Elle ne pouvait vraiment pas se fâcher, il avait de trop bonnes manières. Et c'étaient des conseils pratiques sur l'amour, des allusions sur les salopiauds d'hommes, toutes sortes d'histoires de margots qui s'étaient bien repenties d'y avoir passé, dont Nana sortait languissante, avec des yeux de scélératesse dans son visage blanc.","From that day on, Madame Lerat delighted in her niece's first story. She never let her go, accompanied her morning and evening, emphasizing her responsibility. That bothered Nana a little; but it swelled her all the same, to be guarded like a treasure; and the conversations the two of them had in the streets, with the button maker behind them, warmed him up and made him rather want to take the leap. Oh ! his aunt understood the sentiment; even the button maker, that gentleman already aged and so respectable, softened her, for, after all, feeling in mature people always has deeper roots. Only she was watching. Yes, it would rather pass over her body before reaching the little one. One evening, she approached the gentleman and sent him straight as a bullet that what he was doing there was not good. He greeted her politely, without answering, like an old rocantine accustomed to the rebuffs of his parents. She really couldn't get mad, he had too good manners. And it was practical advice on love, allusions to the bastards of men, all sorts of stories of margots who had really repented of having passed through it, from which Nana emerged languishing, with eyes of villainy in his white face.","Mme Lerat did not allow her niece after this day to set foot on the street without her. Nana at first was inclined to rebel, but, on the whole, it rather flattered her vanity to be guarded like a treasure. They had discovered that the man who followed her with such persistency was a manufacturer of buttons, and one night the aunt went directly up to him and told him that he was behaving in a most improper manner. He bowed and, turning on his heel, departed—not angrily, by any means—and the next day he did as usual.","From that day forth Madame Lerat regaled herself with her niece’s first love adventure. She no longer left her, but accompanied her morning and evening, bringing her responsibility well to the fore. This somewhat annoyed Nana, but all the same she expanded with pride at seeing herself guarded like a treasure; and the talk she and her aunt indulged in in the street with the button manufacturer behind them flattered her, and rather quickened her desire for new flirtations. Oh! her aunt understood the feelings of the heart; she even compassionated the button manufacturer, this elderly gentleman, who looked so respectable, for, after all, sentimental feelings are more deeply rooted among people of a certain age. Still she watched. And, yes, he would have to pass over her body before stealing her niece. One evening she approached the gentleman, and told him, as straight as a bullet, that his conduct was most improper. He bowed to her politely without answering, like an old satyr who was accustomed to hear parents tell him to go about his business. She really could not be cross with him, he was too well mannered. Then came lectures on love, allusions to dirty blackguards of men, and all sorts of stories about hussies who had repented of flirtations, which left Nana in a state of pouting, with eyes gleaming brightly in her pale face."
"D'autres fois, lorsque Coupeau arrivait droit sur elle, sans lui laisser le temps de se sauver, elle s'accroupissait, elle murmurait :","At other times, when Coupeau came straight at her, without giving her time to escape, she crouched down, she murmured:","Then the girl would crouch on her knees and bid the others stand close around her, and when he had passed on after an inquiring look she would jump up and they would all utter peals of laughter.","At other times, when Coupeau came straight up to her without giving her time to run off, she crouched down, made herself small and muttered: “Just you hide me, you others."
"La plume du tourniquet grinçait, l'image de la Fortune, une grande femme rouge, placée sous un verre, tournait et ne mettait plus au milieu qu'une tache ronde, pareille à une tache de vin.","The quill of the turnstile creaked, the image of Fortune, a tall red woman, placed under a glass, turned and left nothing in the middle but a round spot, like a stain of wine.","Behind her the still was at work with constant drip-drip, and she felt a mad desire to grapple with it as with some dangerous beast and tear out its heart.","The needle of the wheel grated, and the figure of Fortune, a big red woman placed under glass, turned round and round until it looked like a mere spot in the centre, similar to a wine stain."
"Gervaise avait échangé un regard avec madame Boche et Virginie. Ça s'arrangeait donc ? Coupeau et Lantier continuaient de causer au bord du trottoir. Ils s'adressaient encore des injures, mais amicalement. Ils s'appelaient « sacré animal », d'un ton où perçait une pointe de tendresse. Comme on les regardait, ils finirent pas se promener doucement côte à côte, le long des maisons, tournant sur eux-mêmes tous les dix pas. Une conversation très vive s'était engagée. Brusquement, Coupeau parut se fâcher de nouveau, tandis que l'autre refusait, se faisait prier. Et ce fut le zingueur qui poussa Lantier et le força à traverser la rue, pour entrer dans la boutique.","Gervaise had exchanged a look with Madame Boche and Virginie. So it worked out? Coupeau and Lantier continued to chat at the edge of the pavement. They still addressed insults to each other, but in a friendly way. They called each other ""sacred animal,"" in a tone that pierced a hint of tenderness. As we watched them, they ended up walking slowly side by side, along the houses, turning on their own every ten paces. A lively conversation had ensued. Suddenly, Coupeau seemed to get angry again, while the other refused, he needed to be asked. And it was the zinc worker who pushed Lantier and forced him to cross the street, to enter the shop.","Gervaise exchanged a look with Mme Boche and Virginie. What did this mean? As the women watched them the two men began to walk up and down in front of the shop. They were talking earnestly. Coupeau seemed to be urging something, and Lantier refusing. Finally Coupeau took Lantier's arm and almost dragged him toward the shop.","Gervaise exchanged a glance with Madame Boche and Virginie. Was it going to end amicably then? Coupeau and Lantier continued to converse on the edge of the pavement. They were still abusing each other, but in a friendly way. As people were staring at them, they ended by strolling leisurely side by side past the houses, turning round again every ten yards or so. A very animated conversation was now taking place. Suddenly Coupeau appeared to become angry again, whilst the other was refusing something and required to be pressed. And it was the zinc-worker who pushed Lantier along and who forced him to cross the street and enter the shop."
"- Vous dites oui, n'est-ce pas ? demanda-t-il.","- You say yes, don't you? he asked.","""You say yes, do you not?"" he asked.","“You’ll say ‘yes,’ won’t you,” asked he."
"- Dites donc, vous, la Tortillard ! mêlez-vous un peu de vos affaires. Il faut peut-être que je mette des gants pour la trifouiller ? C'est à la seule fin de l'avertir, vous voyez bien, histoire simplement de lui montrer que j'ai le bras long.","- Say, you, the Tortillard! mind your own business. Maybe I need to put on gloves to tamper with it? It's for the sole purpose of warning him, you see, just to show him that I have a long arm.","""What business is it of yours?"" And with another adroit movement he cut Lalie across the face.","“Mind your own business a bit, Limper. Perhaps you’d like me to put gloves on when I stir her up. It’s merely to warm her, as you can plainly see—simply to show her that I’ve a long arm.”"
"Et, prenant l'enfant, il continua :","And, taking the child, he continued:",He took up the child.,"And, taking the child up in his arms, he continued: “Let’s have a look at you, miss!"
"Aucun des convives n'émit le moindre doute. On était au dessert. Les garçons débarrassaient la table avec un grand bruit de vaisselle. Et madame Lorilleux, jusque-là très convenable, très dame, laissa échapper un : Sacré salaud ! parce que l'un des garçons, en enlevant un plat, lui avait fait couler quelque chose de mouillé dans le cou. Pour sûr, sa robe de soie était tachée. M. Madinier dut lui regarder le dos, mais il n'y avait rien, il le jurait. Maintenant, au milieu de la nappe, s'étalaient des œufs à la neige dans un saladier, flanqués de deux assiettes de fromage et de deux assiettes de fruits. Les œufs à la neige, les blancs trop cuits nageant sur la crème jaune, causèrent un recueillement ; on ne les attendait pas, on trouva ça distingué. Mes-Bottes mangeait toujours. Il avait redemandé un pain. Il acheva les deux fromages ; et, comme il restait de la crème, il se fit passer le saladier, au fond duquel il tailla de larges tranches, comme pour une soupe.","None of the guests expressed the slightest doubt. We were at dessert. The waiters cleared the table with a great noise of dishes. And Madame Lorilleux, who until then had been very decent, very ladylike, blurted out: Holy bastard! because one of the waiters, while taking away a dish, had poured something wet down his neck. Surely her silk robe was stained. M. Madinier must have looked at his back, but there was nothing, he swore. Now, in the middle of the tablecloth, were snowed eggs in a salad bowl, flanked by two plates of cheese and two plates of fruit. The snowed eggs, the overcooked whites swimming on the yellow cream, caused meditation; we did not expect them, we thought it distinguished. My-Boots was still eating. He had asked for another loaf. He finished the two cheeses; and, as there was still some cream, he had the salad bowl passed to him, from the bottom of which he cut large slices, as if for a soup.","He did not say distinctly what he expected, but it was clear that it was something very agreeable. The dessert was now on the table—a floating island flanked by two plates of cheese and two of fruit. The floating island was a great success. Mes-Bottes ate all the cheese and called for more bread. And then as some of the custard was left in the dish, he pulled it toward him and ate it as if it had been soup.","Not one of the guests suggested the smallest doubt. They had now arrived at dessert and the waiters were clearing the table with much clattering of dishes. Madame Lorilleux, who up to then had been very genteel, very much the lady, suddenly let fly with a curse. One of the waiters had spilled something wet down her neck while removing a dish. This time her silk dress would be stained for sure. Monsieur Madinier had to examine her back, but he swore there was nothing to be seen. Two platters of cheese, two dishes of fruit, and a floating island pudding of frosted eggs in a deep salad-bowl had now been placed along the middle of the table. The pudding caused a moment of respectful attention even though the overdone egg whites had flattened on the yellow custard. It was unexpected and seemed very fancy. My-Boots was still eating. He had asked for another loaf. He finished what there was of the cheese; and, as there was some cream left, he had the salad-bowl passed to him, into which he sliced some large pieces of bread as though for a soup."
"- Voyons, allez-vous-en ! Soyez raisonnable ? J'ai les sangs tournés, ma parole ! On n'a jamais vu une tuerie pareille.","- Come on, go away! Be reasonable ? My blood is turned, my word! We have never seen such a killing.","""Come with me!"" she urged. ""Do be sensible. You are growing so angry that the Lord only knows what the end of all this will be!""","“Come now, go home! Be reasonable. On my word, it’s quite upset me. Never was such a butchery seen before.”"
"- A vous, père Bru, à vous ! dit maman Coupeau. Chantez la vôtre. Les anciennes sont les plus jolies, allez !","- Over to you, Father Bru, over to you! said Mama Coupeau. Sing yours. The old ones are the prettiest, come on!",Virginie whispered to Gervaise:,"“Now, Pere Bru, it’s your turn!” said mother Coupeau. “Sing your song. The old ones are the best any day!”"
"Le lavoir s'amusait énormément. On s'était reculé, pour ne pas recevoir les éclaboussures. Des applaudissements, des plaisanteries montaient, au milieu du bruit d'écluse des seaux vidés à toute volée. Par terre, des mares coulaient, les deux femmes pataugeaient jusqu'aux chevilles. Cependant, Virginie, ménageant une traîtrise, s'emparant brusquement d'un seau d'eau de lessive bouillante, qu'une de ses voisines avait laissé là, le jeta. Il y eut un cri. On crut Gervaise ébouillantée. Mais elle n'avait que le pied gauche brûlé légèrement. Et, de toutes ses forces, exaspérée par la douleur, sans le remplir cette fois, elle envoya un seau dans les jambes de Virginie, qui tomba.","The laundry was having a lot of fun. We had stepped back, so as not to receive the splashes. Applause and jokes arose, amid the sluice noise of buckets being emptied at full speed. On the ground, pools were flowing, the two women were wading up to their ankles. However, Virginie, being treacherous, suddenly seizing a bucket of boiling washing powder that one of her neighbors had left there, threw it away. There was a cry. They thought Gervaise was scalded. But she only had her left foot slightly burned. And, with all her strength, exasperated by the pain, without filling it this time, she threw a bucket at Virginie's legs, who fell.","The whole lavatory were immensely amused, and the women applauded as if at a theater. The floor was covered an inch deep with water, through which the termagants splashed. Suddenly Virginie discovered a bucket of scalding water standing a little apart; she caught it and threw it upon Gervaise. There was an exclamation of horror from the lookers-on. Gervaise escaped with only one foot slightly burned, but exasperated by the pain, she threw a tub with all her strength at the legs of her opponent.","Everyone in the wash-house was highly amused. A good space was left to the combatants, as nobody cared to get splashed. Applause and jokes circulated in the midst of the sluice-like noise of the buckets emptied in rapid succession! On the floor the puddles were running one into another, and the two women were wading in them up to their ankles. Virginie, however, who had been meditating a treacherous move, suddenly seized hold of a pail of lye, which one of her neighbors had left there and threw it. The same cry arose from all. Everyone thought Gervaise was scalded; but only her left foot had been slightly touched. And, exasperated by the pain, she seized a bucket, without troubling herself to fill it this time, and threw it with all her might at the legs of Virginie, who fell to the ground."
"Cependant, ils s'étaient déjà engagés d'une centaine de pas dans la rue de la Goutte-d'Or, lorsqu'il s'arrêta, levant les yeux, disant :","However, they had already gone a hundred paces down the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or, when he stopped, raising his eyes, saying:",They by this time had turned into La Rue de la Goutte-d'Or.,"They had already gone about a hundred paces along the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or, when he stood still and raising his eyes, said:"

"Boche, cependant, restait impénétrable et digne ; il tournait, regardait en l'air, sans se prononcer. Coupeau avait beau lui adresser des clignements d'yeux, il affectait de ne pas vouloir abuser de sa grande influence sur le propriétaire. Il finit pourtant par laisser échapper un jeu de physionomie, un petit sourire mince accompagné d'un hochement de tête. Justement, M. Marescot, exaspéré, l'air malheureux, écartant ses dix doigts dans une crampe d'avare auquel on arrache son or, cédait à Gervaise, promettait le plafond et le papier, à la condition qu'elle payerait la moitié du papier. Et il se sauva vite, ne voulant plus entendre parler de rien.","Boche, however, remained inscrutable and dignified; he was turning, looking up in the air, without deciding. In vain Coupeau winked at him, he affected not to want to abuse his great influence over the proprietor. However, he ends up letting out a play on his face, a thin little smile accompanied by a nod. Just then, M. Marescot, exasperated, looking unhappy, spreading his ten fingers in the cramp of a miser from whom one tears his gold, yielded to Gervaise, promising the ceiling and the paper, on the condition that she would pay half the price. paper. And he ran away quickly, not wanting to hear anything more.","Whitening the curbing, too, comes under, the head of necessary repairs. "" She only required these two things. Finally Marescot, with a desperate air, plunged his hands deep in his pockets, shrugged his shoulders and gave his consent to the repairs on the ceiling and to the paper, on condition that she would pay for half the paper, and then he hurried away.","Boche, all this while, remained dignified and impenetrable; he turned about and looked up in the air, without expressing an opinion. Coupeau winked at him in vain; he affected not to wish to take advantage of his great influence over the landlord. He ended, however, by making a slight grimace—a little smile accompanied by a nod of the head. Just then Monsieur Marescot, exasperated, and seemingly very unhappy, and clutching his fingers like a miser being despoiled of his gold, was giving way to Gervaise, promising to do the ceiling and repaper the shop on condition that she paid for half of the paper. And he hurried away declining to discuss anything further."
"- Voilà une semaine que je compte sur vous, continua la dentellière. Et vous mentez avec ça, vous m'envoyez votre apprentie me raconter des histoires : on est après mon linge, on va me le livrer le soir même, ou bien c'est un accident, le paquet qui est tombé dans un seau. Moi, pendant ce temps-là, je perds ma journée, je ne vois rien arriver et je me tourmente l'esprit. Non, vous n'êtes pas raisonnable ? Voyons, qu'est-ce que vous avez, dans ce panier ! Est-ce tout, au moins ! M'apportez-vous la paire de draps que vous me gardez depuis un mois, et la chemise qui est restée en arrière, au dernier blanchissage ?","- I have been counting on you for a week, continued the lacemaker. And you lie with that, you send me your apprentice to tell me stories: we're after my laundry, we're going to deliver it to me the same evening, or else it's an accident, the package that fell into a bucket. Me, during that time, I'm wasting my day, I don't see anything happening and I'm tormenting my mind. No, you are not reasonable? Let's see, what have you got in that basket! At least that's all! Are you bringing me the pair of sheets you've been keeping for me for a month, and the shirt that was left behind at the last laundering?","""For one whole week,"" resumed the lace mender, ""you have kept me waiting. You have told me falsehood after falsehood. You have sent your apprentice to tell me that there was an accident—something had been spilled on the shirts, they would come the next day, and so on. I have been unnecessarily annoyed and worried, besides losing much time. There is no sense in it! Now what have you brought home? Are the shirts here which you have had for a month and the skirt which was missing last week?""","“For a week past I’ve been expecting you,” continued the lace-mender. “And you tell falsehoods too; you send your apprentice to me with all sorts of stories; you are then busy with my things, you will deliver them the same evening, or else you’ve had an accident, the bundle’s fallen into a pail of water. Whilst all this is going on, I waste my time, nothing turns up, and it worries me exceedingly. No, you’re most unreasonable. Come, what have you in your basket? Is everything there now? Have you brought me the pair of sheets you’ve been keeping back for a month past, and the chemise which was missing the last time you brought home the washing?”"
"- Ah ! il est cher, le pain que je mange ici ! Non, je ne souffrirais pas autant chez des étrangers ! ? Tenez, j'ai voulu une tasse de tisane, eh bien ! on m'en a apporté plein un pot à eau, une manière de me reprocher d'en trop boire ? C'est comme Nana, cette enfant que j'ai élevée, elle se sauve nu-pieds, le matin, et je ne la revois plus. On croirait que je sens mauvais. Pourtant, la nuit, elle dort joliment, elle ne se réveillerait pas une seule fois pour me demander si je souffre ? Enfin, je les embarrasse, ils attendent que je crève. Oh ! ce sera bientôt fait. Je n'ai plus de fils, cette coquine de blanchisseuse me l'a pris. Elle me battrait, elle m'achèverait, si elle n'avait pas peur de la justice.","- Oh! the bread I eat here is expensive! No, I wouldn't suffer so much from strangers! ? Here, I wanted a cup of herbal tea, well! they brought me a full pot of water, a way of reproaching me for drinking too much? It's like Nana, that child I raised, she runs away barefoot in the morning, and I don't see her again. You would think I smell bad. However, at night, she sleeps nicely, she wouldn't wake up once to ask me if I'm in pain? Finally, I embarrass them, they wait for me to die. Oh ! it will be done soon. I no longer have a son, that naughty laundress took him from me. She would beat me, she would finish me off, if she weren't afraid of justice.","""I should not suffer so much among strangers. I should like sometimes a cup of tisane, but I can't get it; and Nana—that child whom I have raised from the cradle—disappears in the morning and never shows her face until night, when she sleeps right through and never once asks me how I am or if she can do anything for me. It will soon be over, and I really believe this clearstarcher would smother me herself—if she were not afraid of the law!""","As soon as anyone called, Virginie or Madame Boche, to ask after her health, she would not reply directly, but immediately started on her list of complaints: “Oh, I pay dearly for the food I eat here. I’d be much better off with strangers. I asked for a cup of tisane and they brought me an entire pot of hot water. It was a way of saying that I drank too much. I brought Nana up myself and she scurries away in her bare feet every morning and I never see her again all day. Then at night she sleeps so soundly that she never wakes up to ask me if I’m in pain. I’m just a nuisance to them. They’re waiting for me to die. That will happen soon enough. I don’t even have a son any more; that laundress has taken him from me. She’d beat me to death if she wasn’t afraid of the law.”"
"Elle referma la porte lentement, avec un dernier coup d'œil dans ce ménage propre, rangé, où il lui semblait laisser quelque chose de son honnêteté. Elle revint à la boutique de l'air bête des vaches qui rentrent chez elles, sans s'inquiéter du chemin. Maman Coupeau, sur une chaise, près de la mécanique, quittait son lit pour la première fois. Mais la blanchisseuse ne lui fit pas même un reproche ; elle était trop fatiguée, les os malades comme si on l'avait battue ; elle pensait que la vie était trop dure à la fin, et qu'à moins de crever tout de suite, on ne pouvait pourtant pas s'arracher le cœur soi-même.","She closed the door slowly, with a last glance at this clean, tidy household, where it seemed to her that she had left something of her honesty behind. She returned to the shop with the stupid look of cows on their way home, without worrying about the way. Maman Coupeau, on a chair near the mechanics, was getting out of bed for the first time. But the laundress did not even reproach her; she was too tired, her bones sick as if she had been beaten; she thought that life was too hard at the end, and that unless you died right away, you couldn't tear your own heart out.","And she closed the door, leaving behind her all that sweet odor and cleanliness on which she had once placed so high a value. She returned to the shop with her head bowed down and looking neither to the right nor the left. Mother Coupeau was sitting by the fire, having left her bed for the first time. Gervaise said nothing to her—not a word of reproach or congratulation She felt deadly tired; all her bones ached, as if she had been beaten. She thought life very hard and wished that it were over for her.","She took a last look around the neatly arranged room and thought as she shut the door that she seemed to be leaving some part of her better self behind. She plodded blindly back to the laundry, scarcely knowing where she was going. When Gervaise arrived, she found mother Coupeau out of her bed, sitting on a chair by the stove. Gervaise was too tired to scold her. Her bones ached as though she had been beaten and she was thinking that her life was becoming too hard to bear. Surely a quick death was the only escape from the pain in her heart."
"Avec ça, il oubliait d'embellir ; un revenant à regarder ! Le poison le travaillait rudement. Son corps imbibé d'alcool se ratatinait comme les fœtus qui sont dans des bocaux, chez les pharmaciens. Quand il se mettait devant une fenêtre, on apercevait le jour au travers de ses côtes, tant il était maigre. Les joues creuses, les yeux dégoûtant, pleurant assez de cire pour fournir une cathédrale, il ne gardait que sa truffe de fleurie, belle et rouge, pareille à un œillet au milieu de sa trogne dévastée. Ceux qui savaient son âge, quarante ans sonnés, avaient un petit frisson, lorsqu'il passait, courbé, vacillant, vieux comme les rues. Et le tremblement de ses mains redoublait, sa main droite surtout battait tellement la breloque, que, certains jours, il devait prendre son verre dans ses deux poings, pour le porter à ses lèvres. Oh ! ce nom de Dieu de tremblement ! c'était la seule chose qui le taquinât encore, au milieu de sa vacherie générale ! On l'entendait grogner des injures féroces contre ses mains. D'autres fois, on le voyait pendant des heures en contemplation devant ses mains qui dansaient, les regardant sauter comme des grenouilles, sans rien dire, ne se fâchant plus, ayant l'air de chercher quelle mécanique intérieure pouvait leur faire faire joujou de la sorte ; et, un soir, Gervaise l'avait trouvé ainsi, avec deux grosses larmes qui coulaient sur ses joues cuites de pochard.","With that, he forgot to embellish; a ghost to watch! The poison was working hard on him. Her alcohol-soaked body shrivelled like the fetuses that are in jars at the drugstores. When he stood in front of a window, you could see daylight through his ribs, he was so thin. Sunken cheeks, disgusting eyes, weeping enough wax to provide a cathedral, he kept only his nose of flowers, beautiful and red, like a carnation in the middle of his devastated face. Those who knew his age, forty years old, had a little shiver when he passed, bent, tottering, old as the streets. And the trembling of his hands redoubled, his right hand especially beat the charm so much that, on certain days, he had to take his glass in his two fists to bring it to his lips. Oh ! this name of God of trembling! it was the only thing that still teased him, in the midst of his general cowering! He could be heard growling fierce curses against his hands. Other times, we saw him for hours in contemplation before his dancing hands, watching them jump like frogs, without saying a word, no longer getting angry, seeming to be looking for some inner mechanism that could make them play the type ; and, one evening, Gervaise had found him like this, with two big tears streaming down his cheeks, cooked like a drunk.","When he came out he did the same thing, so that in three years he was seven times at Sainte-Anne's, and each time he came out the fellow looked more broken and less able to stand another orgy. The poison had penetrated his entire system. He had grown very thin; his cheeks were hollow and his eyes inflamed. Those who knew his age shuddered as they saw him pass, bent and decrepit as a man of eighty. The trembling of his hands had so increased that some days he was obliged to use them both in raising his glass to his lips. This annoyed him intensely and seemed to be the only symptom of his failing health which disturbed him. He sometimes swore violently at these unruly members and at others sat for hours looking at these fluttering hands as if trying to discover by what strange mechanism they were moved. And one night Gervaise found him sitting in this way with great tears pouring down his withered cheeks.","At the same time, he forgot to improve in appearance; a perfect ghost to look at! The poison was having terrible effects. By dint of imbibing alcohol, his body shrunk up like the embryos displayed in glass jars in chemical laboratories. When he approached a window you could see through his ribs, so skinny had he become. Those who knew his age, only forty years just gone, shuddered when he passed by, bent and unsteady, looking as old as the streets themselves. And the trembling of his hands increased, the right one danced to such an extent, that sometimes he had to take his glass between both fists to carry it to his lips. Oh! that cursed trembling! It was the only thing that worried his addled brains. You could hear him growling ferocious insults against those hands of his. This last summer, during which Nana usually came home to spend her nights, after she had finished knocking about, was especially bad for Coupeau."
"Nana, la tête basse, ne répondait toujours rien. Elle avait pris le petit bonnet de tulle, elle demandait à sa mère combien ça coûtait. Et, comme Coupeau allongeait la main pour arracher le bonnet, ce fut Gervaise qui le repoussa, en criant :","Nana, her head bent, still didn't answer anything. She had taken the little tulle bonnet, she was asking her mother how much it cost. And, as Coupeau stretched out his hand to tear off the bonnet, it was Gervaise who pushed him away, crying:","Nana did not seem to hear him. She took up the tulle cap and asked her mother what it cost, and when Coupeau tried to snatch the cap Gervaise pushed him away.","Nana, with bowed head, did not answer a word. She had taken up the little tulle cap and was asking her mother how much it cost. And as Coupeau thrust out his hand to seize hold of the cap, it was Gervaise who pushed him aside exclaiming:"
"Il leva sa face pâle, cligna ses paupières rougies.","He raised his pale face, blinked his reddened eyelids.",He lifted his pale face.,"He raised his pale face, and blinked his red eye-lids."
"- Il n'y a pas quinze jours, continua Gervaise, elle avait sevré son dernier, le petit Jules ; et c'est encore une chance, car l'enfant ne pâtira pas ? N'importe, voilà cette gamine de Lalie chargée de deux mioches. Elle n'a pas huit ans, mais elle est sérieuse et raisonnable comme une vraie mère. Avec ça, son père la roue de coups ? Ah bien ! on rencontre des êtres qui sont nés pour souffrir.","“Not a fortnight ago,” continued Gervaise, “she weaned her youngest, little Jules; and it is still a chance, because the child will not suffer? It doesn't matter, here's that kid Lalie loaded down with two brats. She is not eight years old, but she is serious and reasonable like a real mother. With that, his father the wheel of blows? Ah well ! we meet beings who were born to suffer.","""It is not a fortnight,"" continued Gervaise, ""since she weaned her last baby, and here is that child Lalie left to take care of two mites. She is not eight years old but as quiet and sensible as if she were a grown woman, and her father kicks and strikes her too. Poor little soul! There are some persons in this world who seem born to suffer.""","“She weaned her youngest only two weeks ago, little Jules,” Gervaise went on. “That’s lucky for the baby, he won’t have to suffer. Still, there’s the child Lalie and she has two babies to look after. She isn’t eight yet, but she’s already sensible. Her father will beat her now even more than before.” Goujet gazed at her silently."
"- Notre petite mère, notre petite mère ?","- Our little mother, our little mother?","""Dear little mother!"" he murmured. "" Dear little mother!""","And then he sank on to a chair stammering, “Our little mother, our little mother.”"
"- Ça, c'est du nanan ! cria Clémence, en ouvrant un nouveau paquet.","- That's nanan! cried Clemence, opening a new package.",Gervaise was seated with these piles of soiled linen about her.,"“Oh, here’s something luscious!” cried Clemence, opening another bundle."
"- Je vous demande pardon pour les soixante francs, murmura enfin la blanchisseuse. J'étais comme une folle, j'ai songé à vous ?","""I beg your pardon for the sixty francs,"" murmured the laundress at last. I was like crazy, I thought of you?","""I am always glad to be of use to you,"" answered the blacksmith. ""But pray never allude to the matter before my mother, for I do not wish to trouble her.","“I must ask your pardon for troubling you about the sixty francs,” at length murmured the laundress. “I was half crazy, I thought of you—”"
"Il avait déjà repris son chapeau sur la commode. Mais Gervaise se précipita, balbutiant :","He had already picked up his hat from the chest of drawers.

"Janvier était arrivé, un sale temps, humide et froid. Maman Coupeau, qui avait toussé et étouffé tout décembre, dut se coller dans le lit, après les Rois. C'était sa rente ; chaque hiver, elle attendait ça. Mais, cet hiver, autour d'elle, on disait qu'elle ne sortirait plus de sa chambre que les pieds en avant ; et elle avait, à la vérité, un fichu râle qui sonnait joliment le sapin, grosse et grasse pourtant, avec un œil déjà mort et la moitié de la figure tordue. Bien sûr, ses enfants ne l'auraient pas achevée ; seulement, elle traînait depuis si longtemps, elle était si encombrante qu'on souhaitait sa mort, au fond, comme une délivrance pour tout le monde. Elle-même serait beaucoup plus heureuse, car elle avait fait son temps, n'est-ce pas ? et quand on a fait son temps, on n'a rien à regretter. Le médecin, appelé une fois, n'était même pas revenu. On lui donnait de la tisane, histoire de ne pas l'abandonner complètement. Toutes les heures, on entrait voir si elle vivait encore. Elle ne parlait plus, tant elle suffoquait ; mais, de son œil resté bon, vivant et clair, elle regardait fixement les personnes ; et il y avait bien des choses dans cet œil-là, des regrets du bel âge, des tristesses à voir les siens si pressés de se débarrasser d'elle, des colères contre cette vicieuse de Nana qui ne se gênait plus, la nuit, pour aller guetter en chemise par la porte vitrée.","January had arrived, bad weather, wet and cold. Maman Coupeau, who had been coughing and choking all December, had to stick herself in bed after the Kings. It was his income; every winter, she waited for this. But this winter, people around her said that she would never leave her room except with her feet first; and she had, indeed, a damn rattle that sounded pretty like the fir tree, big and fat though, with one eye already dead and half of her face twisted. Of course, her children would not have finished her off; only, it had dragged on for so long, it was so cumbersome that people wished for its death, deep down, as a deliverance for everyone. She herself would be much happier, for she had had her day, hadn't she? and when one has had its day, one has nothing to regret. The doctor, called once, had not even returned. We gave him herbal tea, so as not to abandon him completely. Every hour we went in to see if she was still alive. She no longer spoke, so suffocated was she; but, with her eyes that remained good, alive and clear, she gazed fixedly at people; and there were many things in that eye, regrets of good age, sadness at seeing her family so eager to get rid of her, anger against that vicious Nana who no longer bothered herself at night, to go and watch in his shirt through the glass door.","January arrived, cold and damp. Mamma Coupeau took to her bed with a violent cold which she expected each year at this time. But those about her said she would never leave the house again, except feet first. Her children had learned to look forward to her death as a happy deliverance for all. The physician who came once was not sent for again. A little tisane was given her from time to time that she might not feel herself utterly neglected. She was just alive; that was all. It now became a mere question of time with her, but her brain was clear still, and in the expression of her eyes there were many things to be read—sorrow at seeing no sorrow in those she left behind her and anger against Nana, who was utterly indifferent to her.","January had now arrived; the weather was wretched, both damp and cold. Mother Coupeau, who had coughed and choked all through December, was obliged to take to her bed after Twelfth-night. It was her annuity, which she expected every winter. This winter though, those around her said she’d never come out of her bedroom except feet first. Indeed, her gaspings sounded like a death rattle. She was still fat, but one eye was blind and one side of her face was twisted. The doctor made one call and didn’t return again. They kept giving her tisanes and going to check on her every hour. She could no longer speak because her breathing was so difficult."
- Quelle heure est-il ?,- What time is it ?,"""Well, what of it?""",“What’s the time?”
"Peu à peu, cependant, la jeune femme s'attrista. Matin et soir, elle allait, rue de la Goutte-d'Or, voir la boutique, qui était toujours à louer ; et elle se cachait, comme si elle commettait un enfantillage indigne d'une grande personne. Cette boutique recommençait à lui tourner la tête ; la nuit, quand la lumière était éteinte, elle trouvait à y songer, les yeux ouverts, le charme d'un plaisir défendu. Elle faisait de nouveau ses calculs, deux cent cinquante francs pour le loyer, cent cinquante francs d'outils et d'installation, cent francs d'avance afin de vivre quinze jours, en tout cinq cents francs, au chiffre le plus bas. Si elle n'en parlait pas tout haut, continuellement, c'était de crainte de paraître regretter les économies mangées par la maladie de Coupeau. Elle devenait toute pâle souvent, ayant failli laisser échapper son envie, rattrapant sa phrase avec la confusion d'une vilaine pensée. Maintenant, il faudrait travailler quatre ou cinq années, avant d'avoir mis de côté une si grosse somme. Sa désolation était justement de ne pouvoir s'établir tout de suite ; elle aurait fourni aux besoins du ménage, sans compter sur Coupeau, en lui laissant des mois pour reprendre goût au travail ; elle se serait tranquillisée, certaine de l'avenir, débarrassée des peurs secrètes dont elle se sentait prise parfois, lorsqu'il revenait très gai, chantant, racontant quelque bonne farce de cet animal de Mes-Bottes, auquel il avait payé un litre.","Gradually, however, the young woman grew sad. Morning and evening she went to the rue de la Goutte-d'Or to see the shop, which was still for rent; and she hid herself, as if she were committing childishness unworthy of a grown-up. This shop was beginning to turn his head again; at night, when the light was out, she found in thinking about it, her eyes open, the charm of a forbidden pleasure. She made her calculations again, two hundred and fifty francs for the rent, a hundred and fifty francs for tools and fittings, a hundred francs in advance in order to live for a fortnight, five hundred francs in all, at the lowest figure. If she didn't talk about it out loud, continually, it was for fear of seeming to regret the savings devoured by Coupeau's illness. She often turned quite pale, having almost let out her desire, catching up with the confusion of an ugly thought. Now, one would have to work four or five years before having put aside such a large sum. His desolation was precisely at not being able to establish himself immediately; she would have provided for the needs of the household, without counting on Coupeau, giving him months to regain a taste for work; she would have calmed down, certain of the future, rid of the secret fears with which she sometimes felt seized when he came back very gay, singing, telling some good joke of this animal from My-Boots, for which he had paid a liter.","The poor woman was growing very sad. Every night and morning she passed the shop for which she had so ardently longed. She made her calculations over and over again until her brain was dizzy. Two hundred and fifty francs for rent, one hundred and fifty for moving and the apparatus she needed, one hundred francs to keep things going until business began to come in. No, it could not be done under five hundred francs. She said nothing of this to anyone, deterred only by the fear of seeming to regret the money she had spent for her husband during his illness. She was pale and dispirited at the thought that she must work five years at least before she could save that much money.","Little by little, the young woman lost her cheerfulness. Morning and evening she went to the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or to look at the shop, which was still to be let; and she would hide herself as though she were committing some childish prank unworthy of a grown-up person. This shop was beginning to turn her brain. At night-time, when the light was out she experienced the charm of some forbidden pleasure by thinking of it with her eyes open. She again made her calculations; two hundred and fifty francs for the rent, one hundred and fifty francs for utensils and moving, one hundred francs in hand to keep them going for a fortnight—in all five hundred francs at the very lowest figure. If she was not continually thinking of it aloud, it was for fear she should be suspected of regretting the savings swallowed up by Coupeau’s illness. She often became quite pale, having almost allowed her desire to escape her and catching back her words, quite confused as though she had been thinking of something wicked. Now they would have to work for four or five years before they would succeed in saving such a sum. Her regret was at not being able to start in business at once; she would have earned all the home required, without counting on Coupeau, letting him take months to get into the way of work again; she would no longer have been uneasy, but certain of the future and free from the secret fears which sometimes seized her when he returned home very gay and singing, and relating some joke of that animal My-Boots, whom he had treated to a drink."
"- Est-ce qu'on sait ! reprit Clémence, en s'essuyant la figure avec sa manche. Ça doit être l'autre soir. Il y en avait deux qui se dépiautaient, à la sortie du Grand-Balcon. J'ai voulu voir, je suis restée là, sous la neige. Ah ! quelle roulée c'était à mourir de rire. L'une avait le nez arraché ; le sang giclait par terre. Lorsque l'autre a vu le sang, un grand échalas comme moi, elle a pris ses cliques et ses claques ? Alors, la nuit, j'ai commencé à tousser. Il faut dire aussi que ces hommes sont d'un bête, quand ils couchent avec une femme, ils vous découvrent toute la nuit ?","- Do we know! resumed Clemence, wiping her face with her sleeve. It must be the other night. There were two who were stripping their skin at the exit from the Grand-Balcony. I wanted to see, I stayed there, under the snow. Ah! what a ride it was to die for. One had her nose torn off; blood spurted on the floor. When the other saw the blood, a big stake like me, she took her clicks and her slaps? So at night I started coughing. It must also be said that these men are stupid, when they sleep with a woman, they discover you all night?",Virginie suddenly stooped down to her hostess and said with a smile:,"“One never knows!” replied Clemence, wiping her face with her sleeve. “It must have been the other night. There were two girls who were flaying each other outside the ‘Grand-Balcony.’ I wanted to see, so I stood there whilst the snow was falling. Ah, what a drubbing! It was enough to make one die with laughing. One had her nose almost pulled off; the blood streamed on the ground. When the other, a great long stick like me, saw the blood, she slipped away as quick as she could. And I coughed nearly all night. Besides that too, men are so stupid in bed, they don’t let you have any covers over you half the time.”"
"L'interne s'était avancé, tirant Coupeau au milieu du matelas. Non, il n'était pas mort. On l'avait déchaussé ; ses pieds nus passaient, au bout ; et ils dansaient tout seuls, l'un à côté de l'autre, en mesure, d'une petite danse pressée et régulière.","The intern had come forward, dragging Coupeau to the middle of the mattress. No, he wasn't dead. They had taken his shoes off; his bare feet passed, at the end; and they danced alone, side by side, in time, with a little hurried and regular dance.","The keeper lifted Coupeau. No, he was not dead; his bare feet quivered with a regular motion.","The house surgeon had drawn near, and was pulling Coupeau into the middle of the mattress. No, he was not dead. They had taken his shoes off. His bare feet hung off the end of the mattress and they were dancing all by themselves, one beside the other, in time, a little hurried and regular dance."
"L'hôtel se trouvait sur le boulevard de la Chapelle, à gauche de la barrière Poissonnière. C'était une masure de deux étages, peinte en rouge lie de vin jusqu'au second, avec des persiennes pourries par la pluie. Au-dessus d'une lanterne aux vitres étoilées, on parvenait à lire, entre les deux fenêtres : Hôtel Boncœur, tenu par Marsoullier, en grandes lettres jaunes, dont la moisissure du plâtre avait emporté des morceaux. Gervaise, que la lanterne gênait, se haussait, son mouchoir sur les lèvres. Elle regardait à droite, du côté du boulevard de Rochechouart, où des groupes de bouchers, devant les abattoirs, stationnaient en tabliers sanglants ; et le vent frais apportait une puanteur par moments, une odeur fauve de bêtes massacrées. Elle regardait à gauche, enfilant un long ruban d'avenue, s'arrêtant, presque en face d'elle, à la masse blanche de l'hôpital de Lariboisière, alors en construction. Lentement, d'un bout à l'autre de l'horizon, elle suivait le mur de l'octroi, derrière lequel, la nuit, elle entendait parfois des cris d'assassinés ; et elle fouillait les angles écartés, les coins sombres, noirs d'humidité et d'ordure, avec la peur d'y découvrir le corps de Lantier, le ventre troué de coups de couteau. Quand elle levait les yeux, au-delà de cette muraille grise et interminable qui entourait la ville d'une bande de désert, elle apercevait une grande lueur, une poussière de soleil, pleine déjà du grondement matinal de Paris. Mais c'était toujours à la barrière Poissonnière qu'elle revenait, le cou tendu, s'étourdissant à voir couler, entre les deux pavillons trapus de l'octroi, le flot ininterrompu d'hommes, de bêtes, de charrettes, qui descendait des hauteurs de Montmartre et de la Chapelle. Il y avait là un piétinement de troupeau, une foule que de brusques arrêts étalaient en mares sur la chaussée, un défilé sans fin d'ouvriers allant au travail, leurs outils sur le dos, leur pain sous le bras ; et la cohue s'engouffrait dans Paris où elle se noyait, continuellement. Lorsque Gervaise, parmi tout ce monde, croyait reconnaître Lantier, elle se penchait davantage, au risque de tomber ; puis, elle appuyait plus fortement son mouchoir sur sa bouche, comme pour renfoncer sa douleur.","The hotel was on the Boulevard de la Chapelle, to the left of the Poissonnière barrier. It was a two-story hovel, painted wine red up to the second floor, with shutters rotten from the rain. Above a lantern with starry panes, one could read between the two windows: Hotel Boncoeur, run by Marsoullier, in large yellow letters, pieces of which had been swept away by the mildew of the plaster. Gervaise, bothered by the lantern, raised herself, her handkerchief to her lips. She was looking to the right, towards the Boulevard de Rochechouart, where groups of butchers, in front of the slaughterhouses, were stationed in bloody aprons; and the cool wind brought a stench at times, a wild smell of slaughtered animals. She was looking to the left, threading a long ribbon of avenue, stopping, almost opposite her, at the white mass of the Lariboisière hospital, then under construction. Slowly, from one end of the horizon to the other, she followed the wall of the toll, behind which, at night, she sometimes heard the cries of the murdered; and she searched the wide angles, the dark corners, black with dampness and filth, with the fear of discovering Lantier's body there, his stomach riddled with stab wounds. When she raised her eyes, beyond this gray and interminable wall which surrounded the city with a band of desert, she saw a great gleam, a speck of sunshine, already full of the morning roar of Paris. But it was always to the Poissonnière barrier that she returned, her neck outstretched, dazed to see flowing, between the two squat pavilions of the granting, the uninterrupted stream of men, animals, carts, which descended heights of Montmartre and the Chapel. There was the trampling of herds, a crowd which abrupt halts spread out in pools on the roadway, an endless procession of workmen going to work, their tools on their backs, their bread under their arms; and the crowd engulfed itself in Paris where it drowned, continuously. When Gervaise, among all these people, thought she recognized Lantier, she leaned forward even more, at the risk of falling; then she pressed her handkerchief more firmly to her mouth, as if to hold back her pain.","The hotel was on the Boulevard de la Chapelle, at the left of the Barrière Poissonnièrs. It was a two-story building, painted a deep red up to the first floor, and had disjointed weather-stained blinds. Above a lantern with glass sides was a sign between the two windows: HÔTEL BONCOEUR KEPT BY MARSOULLIER in large yellow letters, partially obliterated by the dampness. Gervaise, who was prevented by the lantern from seeing as she desired, leaned out still farther, with her handkerchief on her lips. She looked to the right toward the Boulevard de Rochechoumart, where groups of butchers stood with their bloody frocks before their establishments, and the fresh breeze brought in whiffs, a strong animal smell—the smell of slaughtered cattle. She looked to the left, following the ribbonlike avenue, past the Hospital de Lariboisière, then building. Slowly, from one end to the other of the horizon, did she follow the wall, from behind which in the nightime she had heard strange groans and cries, as if some fell murder were being perpetrated. She looked at it with horror, as if in some dark corner—dark with dampness and filth—she should distinguish Lantier— Lantier lying dead with his throat cut. Suddenly Gervaise thought she distinguished Lantier amid this crowd, and she leaned eagerly forward at the risk of falling from the window. With a fresh pang of disappointment she pressed her handkerchief to her lips to restrain her sobs.","The hotel was situated on the Boulevard de la Chapelle, to the left of the Barriere Poissonniere. It was a building of two stories high, painted a red, of the color of wine dregs, up to the second floor, and with shutters all rotted by the rain. Over a lamp with starred panes of glass, one could manage to read, between the two windows, the words, “Hotel Boncoeur, kept by Marsoullier,” painted in big yellow letters, several pieces of which the moldering of the plaster had carried away. The lamp preventing her seeing, Gervaise raised herself on tiptoe, still holding the handkerchief to her lips. She looked to the right, towards the Boulevard Rochechouart, where groups of butchers, in aprons smeared with blood, were hanging about in front of the slaughter-houses; and the fresh breeze wafted occasionally a stench of slaughtered beasts. Looking to the left, she scanned a long avenue that ended nearly in front of her, where the white mass of the Lariboisiere Hospital was then in course of construction. Slowly, from one end of the horizon to the other, she followed the octroi wall, behind which she sometimes heard, during night time, the shrieks of persons being murdered; and she searchingly looked into the remote angles, the dark corners, black with humidity and filth, fearing to discern there Lantier’s body, stabbed to death. She looked at the endless gray wall that surrounded the city with its belt of desolation. When she raised her eyes higher, she became aware of a bright burst of sunlight. The dull hum of the city’s awakening already filled the air. Craning her neck to look at the Poissonniere gate, she remained for a time watching the constant stream of men, horses, and carts which flooded down from the heights of Montmartre and La Chapelle, pouring between the two squat octroi lodges. It was like a herd of plodding cattle, an endless throng widened by sudden stoppages into eddies that spilled off the sidewalks into the street, a steady procession of laborers on their way back to work with tools slung over their back and a loaf of bread under their arm. This human inundation kept pouring down into Paris to be constantly swallowed up. Gervaise leaned further out at the risk of falling when she thought she recognized Lantier among the throng. She pressed the handkerchief tighter against her mouth, as though to push back the pain within her."
I' m' lich' la moitié d' ma goutte :,I' m' lich' half of my gout:,"His song was one familiar to them all and even to the street, for the little crowd at the door joined in the chorus.",He swigs it half upon his way:
"- Allons, ma petite, que diable ! murmurait madame Boche.","- Come on, my little one, what the devil! murmured Madame Boche.","""Come! Come, my child!"" muttered Mme Boche.","“Come, my dear, pull yourself together!” murmured Madame Boche."
"- On moucharde donc ! cria-t-il gaiement en l'apercevant. Elle a fait la bête, n'est-ce pas ? madame Boche ; elle n'a pas voulu appeler ? Attends-moi, j'en ai encore pour dix minutes.","- So we snitch! he shouted cheerfully when he saw her. She acted stupid, didn't she? Madame Boche; she didn't want to call? Wait for me, I still have ten minutes.","""You are watching me, are you?"" he cried gaily. "" Ah, Madame Boche, is she not a silly one? She was afraid to speak to me. Wait ten minutes, will you?""","“Ah! ah! so you’ve been playing the spy on me!” cried he, gaily, on beholding her. “She’s been making a stupid of herself, eh, Madame Boche? She wouldn’t call to me. Wait a bit, I shall have finished in ten minutes.”"
"Gervaise avait repris son panier. Elle ne se levait pourtant pas, le tenait sur ses genoux, les regards perdus, rêvant, comme si les paroles du jeune ouvrier éveillaient en elle des pensées lointaines d'existence. Et elle dit encore, lentement, sans transition apparente :","Gervaise had picked up her basket. She did not get up, however, held him on her knees, staring, dreaming, as if the young workman's words awakened in her distant thoughts of existence. And she says again, slowly, without apparent transition:","Gervaise had taken up her basket; she had not risen from her chair, however, but held it on her knees with a dreary look in her eyes, as if the words of the young mechanic had awakened in her mind strange thoughts of a possible future. She answered in a low, hesitating tone, without any apparent connection:","Gervaise had taken up her basket again. She did not rise from her seat however, but held the basket on her knees, with a vacant look in her eyes and lost in thought, as though the young workman’s words had awakened within her far-off thoughts of existence. And she said again, slowly, and without any apparent change of manner:"
"- Écoute donc, Cadet-Cassis ! ? J'établissais un calcul, ce matin. J'ai commencé à douze ans, n'est-ce pas ? Eh bien ! sais-tu quel bout de colonne j'ai dû faire au jour d'aujourd'hui ?","- Listen, Cadet-Cassis! ? I was doing a calculation this morning. I started when I was twelve, didn't I? Well ! do you know what piece of column I must have done today?","""Look here, Cadet-Cassis,"" he said. ""This very morning I made a little calculation. I began my work when I was only twelve years old. How many yards do you think I have made up to this day?""","“Listen to me, Young Cassis! I was making a calculation this morning. I commenced work when I was twelve years old, you know. Well! Can you guess how long a herring-bone chain I must have made up till to-day?”"
"Gervaise défaisait son paquet, étalait les chemises des petits ; et comme madame Boche lui conseillait de prendre un seau d'eau de lessive, elle répondit :","Gervaise was unpacking her package, spreading out the little ones' shirts; and as Madame Boche advised her to take a bucket of washing-up water, she replied:","Gervaise opened her bundle and sorted the clothes, laying aside all the colored pieces, and when Mme Boche advised her to try a little soda she shook her head.","Gervaise, having undone her bundle, was spreading out the little ones’ shirts, and as Madame Boche advised her to take a pailful of lye, she answered, “Oh, no!"
"- A la vôtre, répondirent Boche et Poisson.","- Cheers, replied Boche and Poisson.",And Poisson and Boche drank with him.,"“Same to you,” replied Boche and Poisson."
"- Nous ne sommes pas arrivés, dit Coupeau. Oh ! c'est un voyage !","- We haven't arrived, said Coupeau. Oh ! it's a trip!","The smells, the turbulent life of this great house, seemed to rush over her in one tremendous gust. She gasped and turned pale. ""We have not got there yet,"" said Coupeau; ""we have much farther to go.""","“We’re not there yet,” said Coupeau. “Oh! It’s quite a journey!”"
"- Monsieur Poisson, écoutez, monsieur Poisson ? Vous me garderez le croupion, n'est-ce pas !","- Mr. Fish, listen, Mr. Fish? You'll keep my rump, won't you!","Gervaise devoured large slices of the breast, hardly speaking, but a little ashamed of her own gluttony in the presence of Goujet.",The policeman allowed several minutes for the company to admire the bishop’s mitre and then finished cutting the slices and arranging them on the platter.
"- Je vous ai fait attendre, hein ? dit Coupeau, qu'elle entendit tout d'un coup près d'elle. C'est une histoire, quand je ne dîne pas chez eux, d'autant plus qu'aujourd'hui ma sœur a acheté du veau.","- I kept you waiting, huh? said Coupeau, whom she heard suddenly near her. It's a story, when I don't have dinner with them, especially since my sister bought veal today.","""I have made you wait too long, I am afraid,"" said Coupeau, whom she suddenly heard at her side. ""They make a great fuss when I do not dine there, and she did not like it today, especially as my sister had bought veal.","“I’m afraid I’ve kept you waiting rather a long time,” said Coupeau, whom she suddenly heard close beside her. “They always make an awful fuss whenever I don’t dine with them, and it was worse than ever to-day as my sister had bought some veal.”"
"Et elle regardait les yeux jaunes de Virginie, où des étincelles d'or luisaient, comme dans ceux des chats. Cette femme lui en voulait donc, qu'elle tâchait de la rendre jalouse ? Mais la couturière prit son air bête, en répondant :","And she looked at Virginie's yellow eyes, in which sparkles of gold gleamed, as in those of cats. So this woman was angry with her, that she was trying to make her jealous? But the seamstress put on her stupid look, answering:","But she looked into Virginie's dark brown eyes, which were specked with gold and emitted sparks as do those of cats. But the woman put on a stupid look as she answered:",She looked straight into Virginie’s eyes. Did this woman still have it in for her? Virginie replied with an air of innocence:
"- Voilà ! dit Coupeau, avec un rire gêné.","- There ! said Coupeau, with an embarrassed laugh.","When the signatures were again affixed to the register in the vestry and the party stood outside in the sunshine, they had a sensation as if they had been driven at full speed and were glad to rest.",“Voila!” said Coupeau with an embarrassed laugh.
"Au milieu de ce démolissement général, Coupeau prospérait. Ce sacré soiffard se portait comme un charme. Le pichenet et le vitriol l'engraissaient, positivement. Il mangeait beaucoup, se fichait de cet efflanqué de Lorilleux qui accusait la boisson de tuer les gens, lui répondait en se tapant sur le ventre, la peau tendue par la graisse, pareille à la peau d'un tambour. Il lui exécutait là-dessus une musique, les vêpres de la gueule, des roulements et des battements de grosse caisse à faire la fortune d'un arracheur de dents. Mais Lorilleux, vexé de ne pas avoir de ventre, disait que c'était de la graisse jaune, de la mauvaise graisse. N'importe, Coupeau se soûlait davantage, pour sa santé. Ses cheveux poivre et sel, en coup de vent, flambaient comme un brûlot. Sa face d'ivrogne, avec sa mâchoire de singe, se culottait, prenait des tons de vin bleu. Et il restait un enfant de la gaieté ; il bousculait sa femme, quand elle s'avisait de lui conter ses embarras. Est-ce que les hommes sont faits pour descendre dans ces embêtements ? La cambuse pouvait manquer de pain, ça ne le regardait pas. Il lui fallait sa pâtée matin et soir, et il ne s'inquiétait jamais d'où elle lui tombait. Lorsqu'il passait des semaines sans travailler, il devenait plus exigeant encore. D'ailleurs, il allongeait toujours des claques amicales sur les épaules de Lantier. Bien sûr, il ignorait l'inconduite de sa femme ; du moins des personnes, les Boche, les Poisson, juraient leurs grands dieux qu'il ne se doutait de rien, et que ce serait un grand malheur, s'il apprenait jamais la chose. Mais madame Lerat, sa propre sœur, hochait la tête, racontait qu'elle connaissait des maris auxquels ça ne déplaisait pas. Une nuit, Gervaise elle-même, qui revenait de la chambre du chapelier, était restée toute froide en recevant, dans l'obscurité, une tape sur le derrière ; puis, elle avait fini par se rassurer, elle croyait s'être cognée contre le bateau du lit. Vrai, la situation était trop terrible ; son mari ne pouvait pas s'amuser à lui faire des blagues.","In the midst of this general demolition, Coupeau prospered. This bloody drinker was doing like a charm. Pitching and vitriol fattened him, positively. He ate a lot, didn't care about that lanky Lorilleux who accused drink of killing people, answered him by slapping his stomach, his skin taut with fat, like the skin of a drum. He played music to it, the vespers of the mouth, rolls and beatings of a bass drum to make a tooth-puller's fortune. But Lorilleux, annoyed at not having a belly, said it was yellow fat, bad fat. No matter, Coupeau got more drunk, for his health. Her salt-and-pepper hair, in a gust of wind, blazed like a fire. His drunkard's face, with its monkey's jaw, sank, taking on shades of blue wine. And he remained a child of gaiety; he jostled his wife whenever she took it into her head to tell him of her embarrassments. Are men made to descend into these troubles? The galley might run out of bread, that was none of his business. He needed his mash morning and night, and he never worried where it fell. When he spent weeks without working, he became even more demanding. Besides, he always gave Lantier a friendly slap on the shoulders. Of course, he was unaware of his wife's misconduct; at least some people, the Boches, the Poissons, swore to their great gods that he suspected nothing, and that it would be a great misfortune if he ever learned the thing. But Madame Lerat, her own sister, shook her head, saying that she knew husbands who liked it. One night, Gervaise herself, who was returning from the hatter's room, had remained quite cold when, in the darkness, she received a pat on the back; then, she had ended up reassuring herself, she thought she had bumped into the boat of the bed. True, the situation was too terrible; her husband couldn't have fun playing jokes on her.","Amid all this ruin Coupeau thrived surprisingly. Bad liquor seemed to affect him agreeably. His appetite was good in spite of the amount he drank, and he was growing stout. Lantier, however, shook his head, declaring that it was not honest flesh and that he was bloated. But Coupeau drank all the more after this statement and was rarely or ever sober. There began to be a strange bluish tone in his complexion. His spirits never flagged. He laughed at his wife when she told him of her embarrassments. What did he care, so long as she provided him with food to eat? And the longer he was idle, the more exacting he became in regard to this food. He was ignorant of his wife's infidelity, at least, so all his friends declared. They believed, moreover, that were he to discover it there would be great trouble. But Mme Lerat, his own sister, shook her head doubtfully, averring that she was not so sure of his ignorance.","In the midst of this general demolishment, Coupeau continued to prosper. The confounded tippler was as well as well could be. The sour wine and the “vitriol” positively fattened him. He ate a great deal, and laughed at that stick Lorilleux, who accused drink of killing people, and answered him by slapping himself on the stomach, the skin of which was so stretched by the fat that it resembled the skin of a drum. He would play him a tune on it, the glutton’s vespers, with rolls and beats loud enough to have made a quack’s fortune. Lorilleux, annoyed at not having any fat himself, said that it was soft and unhealthy. Coupeau ignored him and went on drinking more and more, saying it was for his health’s sake. His hair was beginning to turn grey and his face to take on the drunkard’s hue of purplish wine. He continued to act like a mischievous child. Well, it wasn’t his concern if there was nothing about the place to eat. When he went for weeks without work he became even more difficult. Still, he was always giving Lantier friendly slaps on the back. People swore he had no suspicion at all. Surely something terrible would happen if he ever found out. Madame Lerat shook her head at this. His sister said she had known of husbands who didn’t mind at all."
"Il avait déjà repris le sac, la blanchisseuse dut lui crier :","He had already taken the bag back, the laundress had to shout at him:","""I beg you pardon,"" he said, ""but I thought it was for you,"" and he was turning to go away.","He had already taken up the sack again, and the laundress was obliged to call to him:"
"- Ce qu'il y a de plus dégoûtant, c'est que Nana aurait pu entendre, continua-t-elle. Justement, elle a été agitée toute la nuit, elle qui d'habitude dort à poings fermés ; elle sautait, elle se retournait, comme s'il y avait eu de la braise dans son lit.","""The most disgusting thing is that Nana could have heard,"" she continued. Precisely, she was restless all night, she who usually sleeps soundly; she jumped, she turned over, as if there had been embers in her bed.","""It is all the more disgusting,"" she added, ""because I am certain that Nana heard what was going on quite as well as I did.""","“What’s most disgusting is that Nana might have heard everything,” continued she. “She was indeed restless all the night, she who usually sleeps so sound. She tossed about and kept turning over as though there had been some lighted charcoal in her bed.”"
"- Tiens, c'est toi, bonjour ! ? Pas de blague ! ne me fais pas manger tes cheveux.","- Here, it's you, hello! ? No joke! don't make me eat your hair.","""Ah, it is you, is it? But please keep your hair out of my mouth.""","“Hallow, it’s you? Good-day! No jokes! Don’t make me nuzzle your hair.”"
"Madame Lorilleux n'ajouta rien, se renfermant dans sa dignité, horriblement vexée de s'appeler Queue-de-Vache. Coupeau, pour consoler Gervaise, lui serrait doucement le bras ; et il réussit même à l'égayer, en lui racontant à l'oreille qu'ils entraient en ménage avec la somme de sept sous toute ronde, trois gros sous et un petit sou, qu'il faisait sonner de la main dans la poche de son pantalon. Quand on fut arrivé à l'hôtel Boncœur, on se dit bonsoir d'un air fâché. Et au moment où Coupeau poussait les deux femmes au cou l'une de l'autre, en les traitant de bêtes, un pochard, qui semblait vouloir passer à droite, eut un brusque crochet à gauche, et vint se jeter entre elles.","Madame Lorilleux added nothing, confining herself to her dignity, horribly annoyed at being called Queue-de-Vache. Coupeau, to console Gervaise, squeezed her arm gently; and he even succeeded in cheering her up, by telling her in her ear that they were going into the couple with the sum of seven sous all round, three large sous and a small sou, which he rang with his hand in his pocket. of his pants. When we arrived at the Hotel Boncoeur, we said good-night with an angry air. And just as Coupeau was pushing the two women around each other's necks, calling them beasts, a drunk, who seemed to want to pass to the right, took a sharp turn to the left and threw himself between them.","Mme Lorilleux would not answer. Her dignity was sadly disturbed at being called Cow's-Tail. They walked on in silence until they reached the Hôtel Boncoeur, and just as Coupeau gave the two women a push toward each other and bade them kiss and be friends, a man who wished to pass them on the right gave a violent lurch to the left and came between them.","Madame Lorilleux added nothing further, but retired into her dignity, horribly annoyed at being called Cow’s-Tail. To cheer up Gervaise, Coupeau squeezed her arm softly. He even succeeded in making her smile by whispering into her ear that they were setting up housekeeping with the grand sum of seven sous, three big two-sou pieces and one little sou, which he jingled in his pocket. When they reached the Hotel Boncoeur, the two couples wished each other good-night, with an angry air; and as Coupeau pushed the two women into each other’s arms, calling them a couple of ninnies, a drunken fellow, who seemed to want to go to the right, suddenly slipped to the left and came tumbling between them."
- Tiens ! madame Boche ! cria-t-il tout d'un coup. Ohé ! madame Boche !,- Take ! Mrs Bosch! he shouted suddenly. Oh! Mrs Bosch!,"""Hallo, Madame Boche!"" he cried as he suddenly caught sight of his old friend crossing the street. ""How are you today?""","As he kept his pipe in his mouth, he turned round every now and then to spit onto the pavement. “Look, there’s Madame Boche,” he suddenly exclaimed and called down to her. “Hi! Madame Boche.”"
"Il avait pris, à gauche, un long corridor. Il tourna deux fois, la première encore à gauche, la seconde à droite. Le corridor s'allongeait toujours, se bifurquait, resserré, lézardé, décrépi, de loin en loin éclairé par une mince flamme de gaz ; et les portes uniformes, à la file comme des portes de prison ou de couvent, continuaient à montrer, presque toutes grandes ouvertes, des intérieurs de misère et de travail, que la chaude soirée de juin emplissait d'une buée rousse. Enfin, ils arrivèrent à un bout de couloir complètement sombre.","He had taken a long corridor to the left. He turned twice, the first left again, the second right. The corridor kept getting longer, bifurcated, constricted, cracked, decrepit, now and then lit by a thin flame of gas; and the uniform doors, in a row like the doors of a prison or a convent, continued to show, almost all wide open, interiors of misery and work, which the hot June evening filled with a red mist. Finally, they arrived at a completely dark end of the corridor.","And he turned to the left and then to the right again. The corridor stretched out before them, faintly lit by an occasional gas burner; a succession of doors, like those of a prison or a convent, continued to appear, nearly all wide open, showing the sordid interiors. Finally they reached a corridor that was entirely dark.","He had gone down a long corridor on the left. He turned twice, the first time also to the left, the second time to the right. The corridor still continued branching off, narrowing between walls full of crevices, with plaster peeling off, and lighted at distant intervals by a slender gas-jet; and the doors all alike, succeeded each other the same as the doors of a prison or a convent, and nearly all open, continued to display homes of misery and work, which the hot June evening filled with a reddish mist. At length they reached a small passage in complete darkness."
"- Dis donc, j'attends, moi ? J'ai faim. C'est tout ce que tu paies ?","- Hey, am I waiting? I am hungry. Is that all you pay?","""I am hungry,"" she said softly. ""Hungry, are you?","“Say, I’m waiting; I’m hungry! I’ve got an empty stomach which is all I ever get from you.”"
"- Qu'est-ce que tu regardes donc ? lui demanda madame Lerat, méfiante. Est-ce que ton père t'a accompagnée ?",- So what are you looking at? asked Madame Lerat suspiciously. Did your father come with you?,"""What are you looking at?"" asked her aunt suspiciously. ""Did your father come with you?""","“What are you looking at?” asked Madame Lerat, suspiciously. “Did your father come with you?”"
"Il s'était levé, l'avait empoignée par la taille, lui appliquait un rude baiser sur la figure, au hasard. Puis, comme cette caresse faisait un gros bruit, il s'inquiéta le premier, regardant Claude et Etienne, marchant à pas de loup, baissant la voix.","He got up, grabbed her by the waist, applied a rough kiss to her face, at random. Then, as this caress made a loud noise, he was the first to worry, looking at Claude and Etienne, walking on tiptoe, lowering his voice.","He started up, lifting her from her feet, and kissed her loudly. He glanced at the children.","He jumped up, and, seizing her round the waist, kissed her roughly on the face, at random. Then, as this caress caused a noise, he became anxious, and went softly and looked at Claude and Etienne."
- Ah ! murmura-t-elle simplement.,- Oh! she simply whispered.,Gervaise started to her feet with her brush in her hand.,she muttered speechlessly.
"Depuis la veille, tout ce qu'il buvait était de l'eau-de-vie. Ça redoublait sa soif, et il ne pouvait plus boire, parce que tout le brûlait. On lui avait apporté un potage, mais on cherchait à l'empoisonner bien sûr, car ce potage sentait le vitriol. Le pain était aigre et gâté. Il n'y avait que du poison autour de lui. La cellule puait le soufre. Même il accusait des gens de frotter des allumettes sous son nez pour l'empester.","Since the day before, all he drank was brandy. It redoubled his thirst, and he couldn't drink any more, because everything was burning him. They had brought him a soup, but of course they were trying to poison him, because this soup smelled of vitriol. The bread was sour and spoiled. There was only poison around him. The cell reeked of sulfur. He even accused people of rubbing matches under his nose to stink of him.","For twenty-four hours he had declared that everything he touched to his lips was brandy, and with tears begged for something else, for it burned his throat, he said. Beef tea was brought to him; he refused it, saying it smelled of alcohol. He seemed to suffer intense and constant agony from the poison which he vowed was in the air. He asked why people were allowed to rub matches all the time under his nose, to choke him with their vile fumes.","Since the night before, everything he had had to drink was brandy. It redoubled his thirst and he could no longer drink, because everything burnt him. They had brought him some broth, but they were evidently trying to poison him, for the broth smelt of vitriol. The bread was sour and moldy. There was nothing but poison around him. The cell stank of sulphur. He even accused persons of rubbing matches under his nose to infect him."
"Maman Coupeau hocha la tête. Ce jour-là, elle était tout à fait contre les Lorilleux, à cause du grand repas que les Coupeau donnaient. Elle aimait la cuisine, les bavardages autour des casseroles, les maisons mises en l'air par les noces des jours de fête. D'ailleurs, elle s'entendait d'ordinaire assez bien avec Gervaise. Les autres jours, quand elles s'asticotaient ensemble, comme ça arrive dans tous les ménages, la vieille femme bougonnait, se disait horriblement malheureuse d'être ainsi à la merci de sa belle-fille. Au fond, elle devait garder une tendresse pour madame Lorilleux ; c'était sa fille, après tout.","Mother Coupeau nodded. That day she was completely against the Lorilleuxs, because of the big meal the Coupeaus were giving. She loved the kitchen, the chatter around the saucepans, the houses set in the air by the weddings on feast days. Besides, she usually got on pretty well with Gervaise. On other days, when they were teasing each other, as happens in all households, the old woman grumbled, saying she was horribly unhappy to be thus at the mercy of her daughter-in-law. Deep down, she must have retained a fondness for Madame Lorilleux; she was his daughter, after all.","Her mother-in-law shook her head. She was rather severe in her judgment of the Lorilleuxs that day, inasmuch as she was influenced by the gorgeous entertainment given by the Coupeaus. She liked the excitement; she liked to cook. She generally lived pretty well with Gervaise, but on those days which occur in all households, when the dinner was scanty and unsatisfactory, she called herself a most unhappy woman, left to the mercy of a daughter-in-law. In the depths of her heart she still loved Mme Lorilleux; she was her eldest child.","Mother Coupeau slowly shook her head. That day she was all against the Lorilleuxs, because of the great feast the Coupeaus were giving. She loved cooking, the little gossipings round the saucepans, the place turned topsy-turvy by the revels of saints’ days. Besides she generally got on pretty well with Gervaise. On other days when they plagued one another as happens in all families, the old woman grumbled saying she was wretchedly unfortunate in thus being at her daughter-in-law’s mercy. In point of fact she probably had some affection for Madame Lorilleux who after all was her daughter."
"Sa face s'animait, ce refrain devait éveiller en lui de lointaines gaietés, qu'il goûtait seul, écoutant sa voix de plus en plus sourde, avec un ravissement d'enfant.","His face was animated, this refrain must have awakened in him a distant gaiety, which he tasted alone, listening to her voice becoming more and more muffled, with the delight of a child.",Virginie whispered to Gervaise:,"“Trou la la, trou la la,"
"Puis, se remettant, voyant que Lantier, occupé à dénouer les cordes, ne la regardait seulement pas, elle ajouta :","Then recovering herself, seeing that Lantier, occupied in untying the cords, was not even looking at her, she added:","Lantier, who was busy untying the cords on his trunk, did not look up, and she added:","Then pulling herself together, seeing that Lantier, busy in undoing the cords was not even looking at her, she added:"
"Elle entra, peureuse, de l'air d'une fille qui se coule dans un endroit respectable. Lui, était tout pâle et tout tremblant, d'introduire ainsi une femme chez sa mère morte. Ils traversèrent la pièce à pas étouffés, comme pour éviter la honte d'être entendus. Puis, quand il eut poussé Gervaise dans sa chambre, il ferma la porte. Là, il était chez lui. C'était l'étroit cabinet qu'elle connaissait, une chambre de pensionnaire, avec un petit lit de fer garni de rideaux blancs. Contre les murs, seulement, les images découpées s'étaient encore étalées et montaient jusqu'au plafond. Gervaise, dans cette pureté, n'osait avancer, se retirait, loin de la lampe. Alors, sans une parole, pris d'une rage, il voulut la saisir et l'écraser entre ses bras. Mais elle défaillait, elle murmura :","She entered, fearful, with the air of a girl who slips into a respectable place. He was quite pale and trembling at introducing a woman to her dead mother. They crossed the room with muffled steps, as if to avoid the shame of being overheard. Then, when he had pushed Gervaise into his room, he closed the door. There he was at home. It was the cramped closet she knew, a boarder's room, with a little iron bed covered with white curtains. Against the walls, only, the cut-out images were still spread out and rose to the ceiling. Gervaise, in this purity, dared not advance, withdrew, far from the lamp. Then, without a word, seized with rage, he wanted to grab her and crush her in his arms. But she fainted, she murmured:","Gervaise entered with the air of a woman who is startled at finding herself in a respectable place. He was pale and trembling. They crossed his mother's room softly, and when Gervaise stood within his own he closed the door. It was the same room in which he had lived ever since she knew him—small and almost virginal in its simplicity. Gervaise dared not move. Goujet snatched her in his arms, but she pushed him away faintly.","She went in, half frightened, like a disreputable woman gliding into a respectable place. He was quite pale, and trembled at the thought of ushering a woman like this into his dead mother’s home. They crossed the room on tip-toe, as if they were ashamed to be heard. Then when he had pushed Gervaise into his own room he closed the door. Here he was at home. It was the narrow closet she was acquainted with; a schoolgirl’s room, with the little iron bedstead hung with white curtains. On the walls the engravings cut out of illustrated newspapers had gathered and spread, and they now reached to the ceiling. The room looked so pure that Gervaise did not dare to advance, but retreated as far as she could from the lamp. Then without a word, in a transport as it were, he tried to seize hold of her and press her in his arms. But she felt faint and murmured:"
"Quand elle quitta la chambre, les rires adoucis de Claude et d'Etienne sonnaient seuls dans le grand silence, sous le plafond noir. Il était dix heures. Une raie de soleil entrait par la fenêtre entrouverte.","When she left the room, the softened laughter of Claude and Etienne rang alone in the great silence, under the black ceiling. It was ten o'clock. A ray of sunlight entered through the half-open window.","When she left the room there was not a sound except the stifled laughter of the little ones. It was then after ten, and the sun was shining brightly in at the window.","When she left the room, Claude’s and Etienne’s gentle laughter alone disturbed the great silence beneath the blackened ceiling. It was ten o’clock. A ray of sunshine entered by the half open window."
"- Non, répondit la grande brune. Il a l'air rassis. C'est ça surtout qui est inquiétant. Hein ! pourquoi reste-t-il chez le marchand de vin, s'il est rassis ? ? Mon Dieu ! mon Dieu ! pourvu qu'il n'arrive rien !","- No, replied the tall brunette. He looks stale. This is what is especially worrying. Eh ! why does he stay at the wine merchant's, if he is stale? ? My God ! my God ! as long as nothing happens!","she asked. ""No indeed, and that is what troubled me. Why on earth should he stay there so long if he is not drinking? My heart is in my mouth; I am so afraid something will happen.""","“No,” replied the tall brunette. “He looks as though he had merely had what he required. It’s that especially which makes me anxious. Why does he remain there if he’s had all he wanted? Mon Dieu! I hope nothing is going to happen!”"
"- Ah ! mon Dieu ! ? Il est là, sur le trottoir d'en face ; il regarde ici.","- Oh! my God ! ? He is there, on the sidewalk opposite; he looks here.","Good heavens! There he is again, standing still and looking in.""","“Ah! Mon Dieu! He’s there, on the pavement opposite ; he’s looking this way.”"
"Gervaise dura ainsi pendant des mois. Elle dégringolait plus bas encore, acceptait les dernières avanies, mourait un peu de faim tous les jours. Dès qu'elle possédait quatre sous, elle buvait et battait les murs. On la chargeait des sales commissions du quartier. Un soir, on avait parié qu'elle ne mangerait pas quelque chose de dégoûtant ; et elle l'avait mangé, pour gagner dix sous. M. Marescot s'était décidé à l'expulser de la chambre du sixième. Mais, comme on venait de trouver le père Bru mort dans son trou, sous l'escalier, le propriétaire avait bien voulu lui laisser cette niche. Maintenant, elle habitait la niche du père Bru. C'était là-dedans, sur de la vieille paille, qu'elle claquait du bec, le ventre vide et les os glacés. La terre ne voulait pas d'elle, apparemment. Elle devenait idiote, elle ne songeait seulement pas à se jeter du sixième sur le pavé de la cour, pour en finir. La mort devait la prendre petit à petit, morceau par morceau, en la traînant ainsi jusqu'au bout dans la sacrée existence qu'elle s'était faite. Même on ne sut jamais au juste de quoi elle était morte. On parla d'un froid et chaud. Mais la vérité était qu'elle s'en allait de misère, des ordures et des fatigues de sa vie gâtée. Elle creva d'avachissement, selon le mot des Lorilleux. Un matin, comme ça sentait mauvais dans le corridor, on se rappela qu'on ne l'avait pas vue depuis deux jours ; et on la découvrit déjà verte, dans sa niche.","Gervaise went on like this for months. She tumbled lower still, accepted the latest snubs, died a little of hunger every day. As soon as she had four sous, she drank and beat the walls. She was charged with the dirty errands of the neighborhood. One night we bet she wouldn't eat anything disgusting; and she had eaten it, to earn ten sous. M. Marescot had decided to expel him from the bedroom on the sixth floor. But, as Father Bru had just been found dead in his hole under the stairs, the landlord was good enough to leave him this niche. Now she lived in Father Bru's doghouse. It was in there, on old straw, that she clacked her beak, her stomach empty and her bones frozen. The earth didn't want her, apparently. She was becoming stupid, she didn't even dream of throwing herself out of the sixth floor onto the pavement of the courtyard, to get it over with. Death was to take her little by little, piece by piece, dragging her to the end in the sacred existence she had made for herself. Even we never knew exactly what she had died of. We spoke of a cold and hot. But the truth was that she was leaving the misery, the filth and the fatigues of her spoiled life. She died of sagging, as the Lorilleuxs said. One morning, as it smelled bad in the corridor, they remembered that they had not seen her for two days; and it was discovered already green, in its niche.","But she never became altogether like him in the few remaining months of her existence. She sank lower day by day. As soon as she got a little money from any source whatever she drank it away at once. Her landlord decided to turn her out of the room she occupied, and as Father Bru was discovered dead one day in his den under the stairs, M. Marescot allowed her to take possession of his quarters. It was there, therefore, on the old straw bed, that she lay waiting for death to come. Apparently even Mother Earth would have none of her. She tried several times to throw herself out of the window, but death took her by bits, as it were. In fact, no one knew exactly when she died or exactly what she died of. They spoke of cold and hunger. But the truth was she died of utter weariness of life, and Father Bazonge came the day she was found dead in her den.","Gervaise lasted in this state several months. She fell lower and lower still, submitting to the grossest outrages and dying of starvation a little every day. As soon as she had four sous she drank and pounded on the walls. She was employed on all the dirty errands of the neighborhood. Once they even bet her she wouldn’t eat filth, but she did it in order to earn ten sous. Monsieur Marescot had decided to turn her out of her room on the sixth floor. But, as Pere Bru had just been found dead in his cubbyhole under the staircase, the landlord had allowed her to turn into it. Now she roosted there in the place of Pere Bru. It was inside there, on some straw, that her teeth chattered, whilst her stomach was empty and her bones were frozen. The earth would not have her apparently. She was becoming idiotic. She did not even think of making an end of herself by jumping out of the sixth floor window on to the pavement of the courtyard below. Death had to take her little by little, bit by bit, dragging her thus to the end through the accursed existence she had made for herself. It was never even exactly known what she did die of. There was some talk of a cold, but the truth was she died of privation and of the filth and hardship of her ruined life. Overeating and dissoluteness killed her, according to the Lorilleuxs. One morning, as there was a bad smell in the passage, it was remembered that she had not been seen for two days, and she was discovered already green in her hole."
"Gervaise entra, embarrassée, sans oser même balbutier une excuse. Elle n'était plus exacte, ne venait jamais à l'heure, se faisait attendre des huit jours. Peu à peu, elle s'abandonnait à un grand désordre.","Gervaise entered, embarrassed, without daring even to stammer an excuse. She was no longer punctual, never came on time, kept waiting a week. Little by little, she abandoned herself to a great disorder.",Gervaise entered with some hesitation; she did not dare attempt to excuse herself. She was no longer punctual to the hour or the day—everything about her was becoming perfectly disorderly.,"Gervaise entered, greatly embarrassed, not even daring to mutter an excuse. She was no longer punctual, never came at the time arranged, and would keep her customers waiting for days on end. Little by little she was giving way to a system of thorough disorder."
"Sur le boulevard, Gervaise tourna à gauche et suivit la rue Neuve de la Goutte-d'Or. En passant devant la boutique de madame Fauconnier, elle salua d'un petit signe de tête. Le lavoir où elle allait, était situé vers le milieu de la rue, à l'endroit où le pavé commençait à monter. Au-dessus d'un bâtiment plat, trois énormes réservoirs d'eau, des cylindres de zinc fortement boulonnés, mettaient leurs rondeurs grises ; tandis que, derrière, s'élevait le séchoir, un deuxième étage très haut, clos de tous les côtés par des persiennes à lames minces, au travers desquelles passait le grand air, et qui laissaient voir des pièces de linge séchant sur des fils de laiton. A droite des réservoirs, le tuyau étroit de la machine à vapeur soufflait, d'une haleine rude et régulière, des jets de fumée blanche. Gervaise, sans retrousser ses jupes, en femme habituée aux flaques, s'engagea sous la porte, encombrée de jarres d'eau de javelle. Elle connaissait déjà la maîtresse du lavoir, une petite femme délicate, aux yeux malades, assise dans un cabinet vitré, avec des registres devant elle, des pains de savon sur des étagères, des boules de bleu dans des bocaux, des livres de bicarbonates de soude en paquets. Et, en passant, elle lui réclama son battoir et sa brosse, qu'elle lui avait donnés à garder, lors de son dernier savonnage. Puis, après avoir pris son numéro, elle entra.","On the boulevard, Gervaise turned left and followed the rue Neuve de la Goutte-d'Or. Passing in front of Madame Fauconnier's shop, she saluted with a little nod. The laundrette where she was going was located towards the middle of the street, at the place where the pavement began to rise. Above a flat building, three huge water tanks, tightly bolted zinc cylinders, put on their gray curves; behind, rose the dryer, a very high second story, closed on all sides by thin-bladed shutters, through which passed the fresh air, and which showed pieces of linen drying on wires of brass. To the right of the tanks, the narrow pipe of the steam engine blew out, with a rough and regular breath, jets of white smoke. Gervaise, without rolling up her skirts, like a woman accustomed to puddles, went under the door, cluttered with jars of bleach. She already knew the mistress of the wash-house, a delicate little woman, with sickly eyes, seated in a glass cabinet, with ledgers in front of her, bars of soap on shelves, balls of blue in jars, books of baking soda. soda in packets. And, in passing, she asked him for his beater and his brush, which she had given him to keep during his last soaping. Then, after taking her number, she entered.","Gervaise, on reaching the boulevard, turned to the left and followed the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or. As she passed Mme Fauconnier's shop she nodded to the woman. The lavatory, whither she went, was in the middle of this street, just where it begins to ascend. Over a large low building towered three enormous reservoirs for water, huge cylinders of zinc strongly made, and in the rear was the drying room, an apartment with a very high ceiling and surrounded by blinds through which the air passed. On the right of the reservoirs a steam engine let off regular puffs of white smoke. Gervaise, habituated apparently to puddles, did not lift her skirts but threaded her way through the part of eau de Javelle which encumbered the doorway. She knew the mistress of the establishment, a delicate woman who sat in a cabinet with glass doors, surrounded by soap and bluing and packages of bicarbonate of soda. As Gervaise passed the desk she asked for her brush and beater, which she had left to be taken care of after her last wash. Then having taken her number, she went in.","On the Boulevard, Gervaise turned to the left, and followed the Rue Neuve de la Goutte-d’Or. As she passed Madame Fauconnier’s shop, she slightly bowed her head. The wash-house she was bound for was situated towards the middle of the street, at the part where the roadway commenced to ascend. The rounded, gray contours of the three large zinc wash tanks, studded with rivets, rose above the flat-roofed building. Behind them was the drying room, a high second story, closed in on all sides by narrow-slatted lattices so that the air could circulate freely, and through which laundry could be seen hanging on brass wires. The steam engine’s smokestack exhaled puffs of white smoke to the right of the water tanks. Gervaise was used to puddles and did not bother to tuck her skirts up before making her way through the doorway, which was cluttered with jars of bleaching water. She was already acquainted with the mistress of the wash-house, a delicate little woman with red, inflamed eyes, who sat in a small glazed closet with account books in front of her, bars of soap on shelves, balls of blue in glass bowls, and pounds of soda done up in packets; and, as she passed, she asked for her beetle and her scouring-brush, which she had left to be taken care of the last time she had done her washing there. Then, after obtaining her number, she entered the wash-house."
"C'était un ouvrier zingueur qui occupait, tout en haut de l'hôtel, un cabinet de dix francs. Il avait son sac passé à l'épaule. Ayant trouvé la clef sur la porte, il était entré, en ami.","He was a zinc worker who occupied a ten-franc cabinet at the very top of the hotel. He had his bag slung over his shoulder. Having found the key on the door, he entered as a friend.",The speaker was a tinsmith who occupied a tiny room at the top of the house. His bag of tools was over his shoulder; he had seen the key in the door and entered with the familiarity of a friend.,"Coupeau, a zinc-worker who occupied a ten franc room on the top floor, having seen the door unlocked, had walked in as friends will do."
"- Descends, laisse-les se tuer, ça fera de la canaille de moins !","- Get down, let them kill each other, that will make less scoundrels!","""Come down, I say; let him kill her if he will. It will only make one fool the less in the world!""","“Come down; let them kill each other, it’ll be so much scum the less.”"
"- Oh ! bien sûr ? bien sûr ? répétait Gervaise, les paupières baissées, sans comprendre ce qu'elle disait.","- Oh ! sure ? sure ? repeated Gervaise, her eyes lowered, without understanding what she was saying.","He knew they were honest people, and he was sure he could trust them. ""Of course,"" murmured Gervaise, hardly knowing what she said, ""of course.""","“Oh! that’s certain, quite certain,” repeated Gervaise, looking on the ground and scarcely understanding what she said."
"Mais Gervaise se rentrait davantage dans l'angle de la porte, prise d'une grosse envie de pleurer, qui lui gâtait toute sa journée de joie raisonnable. Elle ne songeait plus à embrasser sa belle-sœur, elle suppliait Coupeau d'éloigner l'ivrogne. Alors, Bazouge, en chancelant, eut un geste plein de dédain philosophique.","But Gervaise went closer to the corner of the door, seized with a great desire to cry, which spoiled her whole day of reasonable joy. She no longer dreamed of kissing her sister-in-law, she begged Coupeau to send the drunkard away. Then Bazouge, staggering, made a gesture full of philosophical disdain.","Gervaise retreated farther into the doorway and with difficulty kept back a sob. She nervously entreated Coupeau to take the man away. Bazonge staggered off, muttering as he did so:","But Gervaise retreated further into the doorway, seized with a longing to cry, which spoilt her day of sober-minded joy. She no longer thought of kissing her sister-in-law, she implored Coupeau to get rid of the drunkard. Then Bazouge, as he stumbled about, made a gesture of philosophical disdain."
"Elle continua à compter tout haut. Elle n'avait aucun dégoût, habituée à l'ordure ; elle enfonçait ses bras nus et roses au milieu des chemises jaunes de crasse, des torchons raidis par la graisse des eaux de vaisselle, des chaussettes mangées et pourries de sueur. Pourtant, dans l'odeur forte qui battait son visage penché au-dessus des tas, une nonchalance la prenait. Elle s'était assise au bord d'un tabouret, se courbant en deux, allongeant les mains à droite, à gauche, avec des gestes ralentis, comme si elle se grisait de cette puanteur humaine, vaguement souriante, les yeux noyés. Et il semblait que ses premières paresses vinssent de là, de l'asphyxie des vieux linges empoisonnant l'air autour d'elle.","She continued to count aloud. She had no disgust, accustomed to filth; she buried her bare, pink arms in the midst of filthy yellow shirts, dishcloths stiffened by the grease of the washing-up water, socks eaten away and rotten with sweat. However, in the strong odor which beat her face bent over the heaps, a nonchalance seized her. She had sat down on the edge of a stool, bending over, stretching out her hands to the right, to the left, with slowed gestures, as if she was intoxicated by this human stench, vaguely smiling, her eyes drowned. And it seemed that her first laziness came from there, from the asphyxiation of the old linens poisoning the air around her.",""" At the same time, however, Gervaise amiably laid down her work and went for the dirty clothes, which she piled up in the back shop.","And she continued counting aloud. Used to this kind of thing she evinced no disgust. She thrust her bare pink arms deep into the piles of laundry : shirts yellow with grime, towels stiff from dirty dish water, socks threadbare and eaten away by sweat. The strong odor which slapped her in the face as she sorted the piles of clothes made her feel drowsy. She seemed to be intoxicating herself with this stench of humanity as she sat on the edge of a stool, bending far over, smiling vaguely, her eyes slightly misty. It was as if her laziness was started by a kind of smothering caused by the dirty clothes which poisoned the air in the shop."
"L'homme s'était arrêté. Mais il n'avait pas semblé entendre. Il tendait la main, il murmurait d'une voix basse :","The man had stopped. But he didn't seem to hear. He stretched out his hand, he murmured in a low voice:",The man stopped. He did not seem to notice what she said but extended his hand and murmured in a low voice:,"The man has stopped. But he did not seem to have heard her. He held out his hand, and muttered in a low voice: “Charity, if you please!”"
"C'était une pièce étranglée, une sorte de boyau, qui semblait le prolongement même du corridor. Un rideau de laine déteinte, en ce moment relevé par une ficelle, coupait le boyau en deux. Le premier compartiment contenait un lit, poussé sous un angle du plafond mansardé, un poêle de fonte encore tiède du dîner, deux chaises, une table et une armoire dont il avait fallu scier la corniche pour qu'elle pût tenir entre le lit et la porte. Dans le second compartiment se trouvait installé l'atelier : au fond, une étroite forge avec son soufflet ; à droite, un étau scellé au mur, sous une étagère où traînaient des ferrailles ; à gauche, auprès de la fenêtre, un établi tout petit, encombré de pinces, de cisailles, de scies microscopiques, grasses et très sales.","It was a constricted room, a sort of gut, which seemed to be the very extension of the corridor. A faded woolen curtain, currently held up by a string, cut the hose in two. The first compartment contained a bed, pushed under an angle of the mansard ceiling, a cast-iron stove still warm from dinner, two chairs, a table and a cupboard whose cornice had to be sawed off so that it could fit between the bed and the door. In the second compartment was installed the workshop: at the bottom, a narrow forge with its bellows; on the right, a vice fixed to the wall, under a shelf on which scrap metal lay; to the left, near the window, a tiny workbench cluttered with pliers, shears, microscopic saws, greasy and very dirty.","It was a long, narrow apartment, almost like a prolongation of the corridor; a woolen curtain, faded and spotted, drawn on one side, divided the room in two. One compartment, the first, contained a bed pushed under the corner of the mansard roof; a stove, still warm from the cooking of the dinner; two chairs, a table and a wardrobe. To place this last piece of furniture where it stood, between the bed and the door, had necessitated sawing away a portion of the ceiling. The second compartment was the workshop. At the back, a tiny forge with bellows; on the right, a vice screwed against the wall under an étagère, where were iron tools piled up; on the left, in front of the window, was a small table covered with pincers, magnifying glasses, tiny scales and shears—all dirty and greasy.","It was a narrow apartment, and seemed as if it were the continuation of the corridor. A faded woolen curtain, raised up just then by a string, divided the place in two. The first part contained a bedstead pushed beneath an angle of the attic ceiling, a cast-iron stove still warm from the cooking of the dinner, two chairs, a table and a wardrobe, the cornice of which had had to be sawn off to make it fit in between the door and the bedstead. The second part was fitted up as a work-shop; at the end, a narrow forge with its bellows; to the right, a vise fixed to the wall beneath some shelves on which pieces of old iron lay scattered; to the left near the window, a small workman’s bench, encumbered with greasy and very dirty pliers, shears and microscopical saws, all very dirty and grimy."
"Elle le supplia, se défendit de s'être jamais plainte ; mais il ferma la malle brutalement, s'assit dessus, lui cria : Non ! dans la figure. Il était bien le maître de ce qui lui appartenait ! Puis, pour échapper aux regards dont elle le poursuivait, il retourna s'étendre sur le lit, en disant qu'il avait sommeil, et qu'elle ne lui cassât pas la tête davantage. Cette fois, en effet, il parut s'endormir.","She begged him, denied ever having complained; but he closed the trunk brutally, sat down on it, shouted to her: No! in the figure. He was indeed the master of what belonged to him! Then, to escape the stares with which she was pursuing him, he went back to stretch out on the bed, saying that he was sleepy, and that she should not bother him any more. This time, in fact, he seemed to be falling asleep.","She entreated him, defended herself from the charge of ever having complained, but he shut the trunk with a loud bang and then sat down upon it, repeating that he was master at least of his own clothing. Then to escape from her eyes, he threw himself again on the bed, saying he was sleepy and that she made his head ache, and finally slept or pretended to do so.","She supplicated, she protested she had never complained; but he roughly closed the trunk and sat down upon it, saying, “No!” to her face. He could surely do as he liked with what belonged to him! Then, to escape from the inquiring looks she leveled at him, he went and laid down on the bed again, saying that he was sleepy, and requesting her not to make his head ache with any more of her row. This time indeed, he seemed to fall asleep."
"- Il n'est pas gentil, alors ?","- He's not nice, then?","""He is not good to you then?""","Then, she observed out loud, “He isn’t nice, then?”"
"Coupeau, dans le quartier, gueulait que Lantier était un ami, un vrai. On pouvait baver sur leur compte, lui savait ce qu'il savait, se fichait du bavardage, du moment où il avait l'honnêteté de son côté. Quand ils sortaient tous les trois, le dimanche, il obligeait sa femme et le chapelier à marcher devant lui, bras dessus, bras dessous, histoire de crâner dans la rue ; et il regardait les gens, tout prêt à leur administrer un va-te-laver, s'ils s'étaient permis la moindre rigolade. Sans doute, il trouvait Lantier un peu fiérot, l'accusait de faire sa Sophie devant le vitriol, le blaguait parce qu'il savait lire et qu'il parlait comme un avocat. Mais, à part ça, il le déclarait un bougre à poils. On n'en aurait pas trouvé deux aussi solides dans la Chapelle. Enfin, ils se comprenaient, ils étaient bâtis l'un pour l'autre. L'amitié avec un homme, c'est plus solide que l'amour avec une femme.","Coupeau, in the neighborhood, yelled that Lantier was a friend, a real one. We could drool over them, he knew what he knew, didn't care about gossip, as long as he had honesty on his side. When the three of them went out on Sundays, he made his wife and the hatter walk in front of him, arm in arm, just to show off in the street; and he looked at the people, quite ready to give them a wash, if they had allowed themselves the slightest laugh. No doubt he found Lantier a little proud, accused him of playing his Sophie in the face of vitriol, made fun of him because he knew how to read and spoke like a lawyer. But other than that, he called him a furry bugger. You wouldn't have found two as solid in the Chapel. Finally, they understood each other, they were built for each other. Friendship with a man is stronger than love with a woman.","Coupeau declared to everyone that Lantier was a true friend. There was no nonsense about him; he could be relied upon always and in all emergencies. And he trusted him thoroughly, he declared. When they went out together—the three—on Sundays he bade his wife and Lantier walk arm in arm, while he mounted guard behind, ready to cuff the ears of anyone who ventured on a disrespectful glance, a sneer or a wink. He laughed good-naturedly before Lantier's face, told him he put on a great many airs with his coats and his books, but he liked him in spite of them. They understood each other, he said, and a man's liking for another man is more solid and enduring than his love for a woman.","Coupeau went braying about everywhere that Lantier was a friend and a true one. People might jabber about them; he knew what he knew and did not care a straw for their gossip, for he had respectability on his side. When they all three went out walking on Sundays, he made his wife and the hatter walk arm-in-arm before him, just by way of swaggering in the street; and he watched the people, quite prepared to administer a drubbing if anyone had ventured on the least joke. It was true that he regarded Lantier as a bit of a high flyer. He accused him of avoiding hard liquor and teased him because he could read and spoke like an educated man. Still, he accepted him as a regular comrade. They were ideally suited to each other and friendship between men is more substantial than love for a woman."
"- Tiens ! murmura-t-il en clignant un œil, elle a une fraise sous le bras.","- Take ! he whispered, winking, she has a strawberry under her arm.","""Are you there then?"" cried Mme Boche when she saw him.","It would be fun if her chemise burst open. “Why,” murmured he, blinking his eye, “she’s got a strawberry birthmark under her arm.”"
"- Plus on met de l'huile de coude, plus ça reluit, dit sentencieusement Lantier, la bouche pleine de pastilles.","""The more elbow grease you put in, the more it shines,"" Lantier said ruefully, his mouth full of pellets.","""The more elbow grease she uses, the more she shines,"" said Lantier sententiously with his mouth full.","“The more elbow grease one uses, the more it shines,” said Lantier, sententiously, with his mouth full of peppermint drops."
- A la porte ! hurlaient les danseurs.,- At the door ! shouted the dancers.,Coupeau discovered that his daughter's partner was the young man for whom he had been looking.,howled the dancers.
"- Vous venez voir le petit ? Il est sage, il commence à avoir de la poigne.","- Are you coming to see the little one? He is wise, he is beginning to have a firm grip.","he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","“You’ve come to see the youngster. He behaves himself well, he’s beginning to get some strength in his wrists.”"
"Une drôle de démolition tout de même, s'en aller en se tordant, comme une fille à laquelle les chatouilles font de l'effet !","A funny demolition all the same, to go away while writhing, like a girl to whom the ticklings have the effect!",The belly and the shoulders trembled like water just on the point of boiling.,"It was a funny demolition all the same, going off wriggling like a girl being tickled."
"Naturellement, rue de la Goutte-d'Or, les Boche et les autres l'attendaient. Dès qu'elle parut sous la porte, on l'appela dans la loge. Eh bien ! est-ce que le père Coupeau durait toujours ? Mon Dieu ! oui, il durait toujours. Boche semblait stupéfait et consterné : il avait parié un litre que le père Coupeau n'irait pas jusqu'au soir. Comment ! il durait encore ! Et toute la société s'étonnait, en se tapant sur les cuisses. En voilà un gaillard qui résistait ! Madame Lorilleux calcula les heures : trente-six heures et vingt-quatre heures, soixante heures. Sacré mâtin ! soixante heures déjà qu'il jouait des quilles et de la gueule ! On n'avait jamais vu un pareil tour de force. Mais Boche, qui riait jaune à cause de son litre, questionnait Gervaise d'un air de doute, en lui demandant si elle était bien sûre qu'il n'eût pas défilé la parade derrière son dos. Oh ! non, il sautait trop fort, il n'en avait pas envie. Alors, Boche, insistant davantage, la pria de refaire un peu comme il faisait, pour voir. Oui, oui, encore un peu ! à la demande générale ! la société lui disait qu'elle serait bien gentille, car justement il y avait là deux voisines, qui n'avaient pas vu la veille, et qui venaient de descendre exprès pour assister au tableau. La concierge criait au monde de se ranger, les gens débarrassaient le milieu de la loge, en se poussant du coude, avec un frémissement de curiosité. Cependant, Gervaise baissait la tête. Vrai, elle craignait de se rendre malade. Pourtant, désirant prouver que ce n'était pas histoire de se faire prier, elle commença deux ou trois petits sauts ; mais elle devint toute chose, elle se rejeta en arrière ; parole d'honneur, elle ne pouvait pas ! Un murmure de désappointement courut : c'était dommage, elle imitait ça à la perfection. Enfin, si elle ne pouvait pas ! Et, comme Virginie retournait à sa boutique, on oublia le père Coupeau, pour causer vivement du ménage Poisson, une pétaudière maintenant ; la veille, les huissiers étaient venus ; le sergent de ville allait perdre sa place ; quant a Lantier, il tournait autour de la fille du restaurant d'à côté, une femme magnifique, qui parlait de s'établir tripière. Dame ! on en rigolait, on voyait déjà une tripière installée dans la boutique ; après la friandise, le solide. Ce cocu de Poisson avait une bonne tête, dans tout ça ; comment diable un homme, dont le métier était d'être malin, se montrait-il si godiche chez lui. Mais on se tut brusquement, en apercevant Gervaise qu'on ne regardait plus et qui s'essayait toute seule au fond de la loge, tremblant des pieds et des mains, faisant Coupeau. Bravo ! c'était ça, on n'en demandait pas davantage. Elle resta hébétée, ayant l'air de sortir d'un rêve. Puis, elle fila raide. Bien le bonsoir, la compagnie ! elle montait pour tâcher de dormir.","Naturally, in the rue de la Goutte-d'Or, the Boches and the others were waiting for him. As soon as she appeared under the door, she was called into the box. Well ! did Father Coupeau last forever? My God ! yes, it lasted forever. Boche seemed stupefied and dismayed: he had bet a liter that Father Coupeau would not go until evening. How ! it was still going on! And the whole company was astonished, slapping their thighs. Here is a guy who resisted! Madame Lorilleux calculated the hours: thirty-six hours and twenty-four hours, sixty hours. Sacred mastiff! sixty hours already that he had been bowling and drinking! We had never seen such a tour de force. But Boche, who was laughing madly because of his liter, questioned Gervaise with an air of doubt, asking her if she was quite sure that he had not paraded the parade behind her back. Oh ! no, he was jumping too hard, he didn't want to. So, Boche, insisting more, asked her to repeat a little as he was doing, just to see. Yes, yes, a little more! by popular demand! society told her that she would be very nice, because there were just two neighbors there, who had not seen the day before, and who had just come down on purpose to be present at the picture. The concierge was shouting to everyone to pull over, people were clearing the middle of the box, nudging each other with a quiver of curiosity. However, Gervaise lowered her head. True, she was afraid of making herself ill. However, wishing to prove that it was not history to be made request, it started two or three small jumps; but she became everything, she threw herself back; word of honor, she couldn't! A murmur of disappointment ran: it was a pity, she imitated that to perfection. Well, if she couldn't! And, as Virginie was going back to her shop, they forgot old Coupeau, to talk lively about the Poisson household, a petaudière now; the day before, the ushers had come; the sergent de ville was about to lose his place; as for Lantier, he hovered around the girl from the restaurant next door, a magnificent woman, who was talking about setting up a tripe. Lady ! we laughed about it, we already saw a tripière installed in the shop; after the delicacy, the solid. This Pisces cuckold had a good head in all that; how the devil could a man, whose job it was to be clever, show himself to be so stupid at home. But they suddenly fell silent when they saw Gervaise, whom no one was looking at, and who was trying herself alone at the back of the box, trembling in her feet and hands, like Coupeau. Cheer ! that was it, we didn't ask for more. She remained dazed, looking like she had come out of a dream. Then she spun stiff. Good evening, company! she was going upstairs to try to sleep.","When she reached the house the concierge and all the others were waiting and called her into the loge. Was Coupeau still alive? they asked. Boche seemed quite disturbed at her answer, as he had made a bet that he would not live twenty-four hours. Everyone was astonished. Mme Lorilleux made a mental calculation: ""Sixty hours,"" she said. ""His strength is extraordinary."" Then Boche begged Gervaise to show them once more what Coupeau did. The demand became general, and it was pointed out to her that she ought not to refuse, for there were two neighbors there who had not seen her representation the night previous and who had come in expressly to witness it. They made a space in the center of the room, and a shiver of expectation ran through the little crowd. Gervaise was very reluctant. She was really afraid—afraid of making herself ill. She finally made the attempt but drew back again hastily. No, she could not; it was quite impossible. Everyone was disappointed, and Virginie went away. Then everyone began to talk of the Poissons. A warrant had been served on them the night before. Poisson was to lose his place. As to Lantier, he was hovering around a woman who thought of taking the shop and meant to sell hot tripe. Lantier was in luck, as usual. As they talked someone caught sight of Gervaise and pointed her out to the others. She was at the very back of the loge, her feet and hands trembling, imitating Coupeau, in fact. They spoke to her. She stared wildly about, as if awaking from a dream, and then left the room. The next day she left the house at noon, as she had done before.","In the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or the Boches and the others were naturally awaiting her. The moment she appeared they called her into the concierge’s room. Well! was old Coupeau still in the land of the living? Mon Dieu! yes, he still lived. Boche seemed amazed and confounded; he had bet a bottle that old Coupeau would not last till the evening. What! He still lived! And they all exhibited their astonishment, and slapped their thighs. There was a fellow who lasted! Madame Lorilleux reckoned up the hours; thirty-six hours and twenty-four hours, sixty hours. Sacre Dieu! already sixty hours that he had been doing the jig and screaming! Such a feat of strength had never been seen before. But Boche, who was upset that he had lost the bet, questioned Gervaise with an air of doubt, asking her if she was quite sure he had not filed off behind her back. Oh! no, he had no desire to, he jumped about too much. Then Boche, still doubting, begged her to show them again a little how he was acting, just so they could see. Yes, yes, a little more! The request was general! The company told her she would be very kind if she would oblige, for just then two neighbors happened to be there who had not been present the day before, and who had come down purposely to see the performance. The concierge called to everybody to make room, they cleared the centre of the apartment, pushing one another with their elbows, and quivering with curiosity. Gervaise, however, hung down her head. Really, she was afraid it might upset her. Desirous though of showing that she did not refuse for the sake of being pressed, she tried two or three little leaps; but she became quite queer, and stopped; on her word of honor, she was not equal to it! There was a murmur of disappointment; it was a pity, she imitated it perfectly. However, she could not do it , it was no use insisting! And when Virginie left to return to her shop, they forgot all about old Coupeau and began to gossip about the Poissons and their home, a real mess now. The day before, the bailiffs had been; the policeman was about to lose his place; as for Lantier, he was now making up to the daughter of the restaurant keeper next door, a fine woman, who talked of setting up as a tripe-seller. Ah! it was amusing, everyone already beheld a tripe-seller occupying the shop; after the sweets should come something substantial. And that blind Poisson! How could a man whose profession required him to be so smart fail to see what was going on in his own home? They stopped talking suddenly when they noticed that Gervaise was off in a corner by herself imitating Coupeau. Her hands and feet were jerking. Yes, they couldn’t ask for a better performance! Then Gervaise started as if waking from a dream and hurried away calling out good-night to everyone."
"Goujet, cependant, la regardait, tandis que la neige effeuillait des pâquerettes dans sa belle barbe jaune. Puis, comme elle baissait la tête en reculant, il la retint.","Goujet, meanwhile, watched her, while the snow plucked the daisies from his beautiful yellow beard. Then, as she lowered her head as she stepped back, he held her back.","Goujet looked at her while the snow whitened his yellow beard. ""Come!""",He looked at her while the snow scattered daisies over his beautiful yellow beard. Then as she lowered her head and stepped back he detained her.
- Mais on ne peut pas la laisser massacrer ! dit Gervaise toute tremblante.,"- But we can't let her be massacred! said Gervaise, trembling all over.","""Would you let her be killed?"" exclaimed Gervaise, trembling from head to foot, and she entered the attic room, which was very clean and very bare, for the man had sold the very sheets off the bed to satisfy his mad passion for drink.","“But we mustn’t let her be murdered!” said Gervaise, all in a tremble."
"Puis, à le retrouver sans cesse là, il ne lui parut plus si drôle. Elle avait une peur sourde de lui, elle aurait crié s'il s'était approché. Souvent, lorsqu'elle s'arrêtait devant un bijoutier, elle l'entendait tout d'un coup qui lui bégayait des choses dans le dos. Et c'était vrai ce qu'il disait, elle aurait bien voulu avoir une croix avec un velours au cou, ou encore de petites boucles d'oreilles de corail, si petites, qu'on croirait des gouttes de sang. Même, sans ambitionner des bijoux, elle ne pouvait vraiment pas rester un guenillon, elle était lasse de se retaper avec la gratte des ateliers de la rue du Caire, elle avait surtout assez de sa casquette, ce caloquet sur lequel les fleurs chipées chez Titreville faisaient un effet de gringuenaudes pendues comme des sonnettes au derrière d'un pauvre homme. Alors, trottant dans la boue, éclaboussée par les voitures, aveuglée par le resplendissement des étalages, elle avait des envies qui la tortillaient à l'estomac, ainsi que des fringales, des envies d'être bien mise, de manger dans les restaurants, d'aller au spectacle, d'avoir une chambre à elle avec de beaux meubles. Elle s'arrêtait toute pâle de désir, elle sentait monter du pavé de Paris une chaleur le long de ses cuisses, un appétit féroce de mordre aux jouissances dont elle était bousculée, dans la grande cohue des trottoirs. Et, ça ne manquait jamais, justement à ces moments-là, son vieux lui coulait à l'oreille des propositions. Ah ! comme elle lui aurait tapé dans la main, si elle n'avait pas eu peur de lui, une révolte intérieure qui la raidissait dans ses refus, furieuse et dégoûtée de l'inconnu de l'homme, malgré tout son vice.","Then, seeing him constantly there, he no longer seemed so funny. She was terrified of him, she would have screamed if he had approached. Often, when she stopped in front of a jeweler, she suddenly heard him stuttering things behind her. And it was true what he was saying, she would have liked to have had a cross with velvet around her neck, or even little coral earrings, so small you would think they were drops of blood. Even, without ambitioning for jewelry, she really couldn't remain a rag, she was tired of messing around with the scrapes of the workshops in the rue du Caire, she was especially tired of her cap, this cap on which the flowers snatched at Titreville had the effect of jingles hanging like bells from a poor man's behind. So, trotting through the mud, splashed by cars, blinded by the gleam of stalls, she had cravings that writhed in her stomach, as well as cravings, desires to be well dressed, to eat in restaurants, to go to the show, to have a room of her own with beautiful furniture. She stopped quite pale with desire, she felt a heat rise from the pavement of Paris along her thighs, a ferocious appetite to bite into the pleasures with which she was jostled, in the great crush of the sidewalks. And, it never failed, precisely at such times, his old man whispered proposals in his ear. Ah! how she would have patted him on the hand, if she hadn't been afraid of him, an inner revolt that stiffened her in her refusals, furious and disgusted at the unknown man, despite all her vice.","Often when she stopped before the jeweler's he would suddenly appear at her side and ask her what she wanted. She did not care so much for jewelry or ornaments as she did for many other things. Sometimes as the mud was spattered over her from the wheels of a carriage she grew faint and sick with envious longings to be better dressed, to go to the theater, to have a pretty room all to herself. She longed to see another side of life, to know something of its pleasures. The stranger invariably appeared at these moments, but she always turned and fled, so great was her horror of him.","Then, on finding him always behind her, she no longer thought him so funny. She became afraid of him and would have called out if he had approached her. Often, when she stopped in front of a jeweler’s shop, she heard him stammering something behind her. And what he said was true; she would have liked to have had a cross with a velvet neck-band, or a pair of coral earrings, so small you would have thought they were drops of blood. More and more, as she plodded through the mire of the streets, getting splashed by passing vehicles and being dazzled by the magnificence of the window displays, she felt longings that tortured her like hunger pangs, yearnings for better clothes, for eating in restaurants, for going to the theatre, for a room of her own with nice furniture. Right at those moments, it never failed that her old gentleman would come up to whisper something in her ear. Oh, if only she wasn’t afraid of him, how readily she would have taken up with him."
"- Toujours du vin, jamais de casse-poitrine ! dit tout d'un coup le zingueur, qui éprouva le besoin de faire cette déclaration. Le casse-poitrine, ça soûle, n'en faut pas !","- Always wine, never booze! suddenly said the zinc worker, who felt the need to make this declaration. The chest breaker, it gets drunk, don't need it!","Mme Putois had attacked the basket of linen prepared by Gervaise, and Augustine was ironing her towels, with her nose in the air, deeply interested in a fly that was buzzing about.","“Always wine, never spirits!” suddenly said the zinc-worker, who felt the necessity of making this declaration. “Spirits make me drunk, I’ll have none of them.”"
"Des rires, de nouveau, avaient couru. Mais bientôt le cri : Assez ! assez ! recommença. Gervaise n'entendait pas, ne se lassait pas. Elle regardait sa besogne, penchée, préoccupée de ne pas laisser une place sèche. Elle voulait toute cette peau battue, couverte de confusion. Et elle causait, prise d'une gaieté féroce, se rappelant une chanson de lavandière :","Laughter, again, had run. But soon the cry: Enough! enough ! started again. Gervaise did not hear, did not tire. She watched her work, leaning over, preoccupied not to leave a dry spot. She wanted all that battered skin, covered in confusion. And she chatted, seized with fierce gaiety, remembering a washerwoman's song:","The women were laughing again by this time, but soon the cry began again of ""Enough! Enough!"" Gervaise did not even hear. She seemed entirely absorbed, as if she were fulfilling an appointed task, and she talked with strange, wild gaiety, recalling one of the rhymes of her childhood:","Laughter again burst forth from the lookers-on, but soon the cry, “Enough! Enough!” recommenced. Gervaise heard not, neither did she tire. She examined her work, bent over it, anxious not to leave a dry place. She wanted to see the whole of that skin beaten, covered with contusions. And she talked, seized with a ferocious gaiety, recalling a washerwoman’s song,"
"Elle était très sévère là-dessus. Elle voulait qu'on lui rapportât son linge, sans qu'une pièce manquât, pour le bon ordre, disait-elle. Une autre de ses exigences était que la blanchisseuse vint exactement le jour fixé et chaque fois à la même heure ; comme ça, personne ne perdait son temps.","She was very strict about it. She wanted her linen brought back to her, without a single piece missing, to keep things in order, she said. Another of his demands was that the laundress come exactly on the appointed day and each time at the same time; that way no one was wasting their time.","""Have you brought everything?"" asked Mme Goujet, who was very exacting on this point. She insisted on every piece being returned each week. Another thing she exacted was that the clothes should be brought back always on the same day and hour.","She was very strict on that point. She insisted on having her washing brought home without a single article being kept back for the sake of order, as she said. She also required the laundress always to come on the day arranged and at the same hour; in that way there was no time wasted."
- Eh bien ! il faut nous en aller ensemble.,- Well ! we must go together.,"My mother says things are all going wrong with you, and,"" he hesitated, ""we must go away together and at once.""","Well, then, we can go away together.”"
"Il était d'une grande piété ; il pria d'un air recueilli de curé, puis traça une croix en l'air, en aspergeant le corps avec la branche de buis. Toute la famille, qui avait quitté la table, se tenait debout, fortement impressionnée. M. Marescot, ayant achevé ses dévotions, passa dans la boutique et dit aux Coupeau :","He was very pious; he prayed with the contemplative air of a priest, then traced a cross in the air, sprinkling the body with the branch of boxwood. The whole family, who had left the table, stood there, greatly impressed. M. Marescot, having finished his devotions, went into the shop and said to the Coupeaus:","He was very religious, they saw. He made a sign of the cross in the air and dipped the branch into the holy water and sprinkled the body. M. Marescot, having finished his devotions, passed out into the shop and said to Coupeau:","He bowed in silence and went straight to the little room, where he knelt down. All the family, leaving the table, stood up, greatly impressed. Monsieur Marescot, having finished his devotions, passed into the shop and said to the Coupeaus:"
- Attendez ! reprit Gervaise. Ça va s'arranger.,- Wait ! resumed Gervaise. It'll get better.,"""Wait!"" cried Gervaise. ""I will arrange it.""",“Wait!” resumed Gervaise. “I can manage it.”
"Pourtant, le lundi, comme Gervaise avait un bon petit repas pour le soir, un reste de haricots et une chopine, elle se donna le prétexte qu'une promenade lui ouvrirait l'appétit. La lettre de l'asile, sur la commode, l'embêtait. La neige avait fondu, il faisait un temps de demoiselle, gris et doux, avec un fond vif dans l'air qui ragaillardissait. Elle partit à midi, car la course était longue ; il fallait traverser Paris, et sa gigue restait toujours en retard. Avec ça, il y avait une suée de monde dans les rues ; mais le monde l'amusait, elle arriva très gentiment. Lorsqu'elle se fut nommée, on lui en raconta une raide : il paraît qu'on avait repêché Coupeau au Pont-Neuf ; il s'était élancé par-dessus le parapet, en croyant voir un homme barbu qui lui barrait le chemin. Un joli saut, n'est-ce pas ? et quant à savoir comment Coupeau se trouvait sur le Pont-Neuf, c'était une chose qu'il ne pouvait pas expliquer lui-même.","However, on Monday, as Gervaise had a nice little meal for the evening, some leftover beans and a pint, she gave herself the pretext that a walk would whet her appetite. The letter from the asylum, on the chest of drawers, bothered him. The snow had melted, the weather was lovely, gray and mild, with a lively background in the cheering air. She left at noon, for the race was long; he had to cross Paris, and his jig was always late. With that, there was a sweat of people in the streets; but the world amused her, she arrived very kindly. When she had named herself, they told her a rude one: it seems that Coupeau had been rescued from the Pont-Neuf; he had rushed over the parapet, thinking he saw a bearded man who blocked his way. A nice jump, isn't it? and as to how Coupeau was on the Pont-Neuf, that was something he could not explain himself.","On Sunday, as Gervaise had a nice little repast ready for the evening, she decided that an excursion would give her an appetite. The letter from the asylum stared her in the face and worried her. The snow had melted; the sky was gray and soft, and the air was fresh. She started at noon, as the days were now short and Sainte-Anne's was a long distance off, but as there were a great many people in the street, she was amused. When she reached the hospital she heard a strange story. It seems that Coupeau—how, no one could say—had escaped from the hospital and had been found under the bridge. He had thrown himself over the parapet, declaring that armed men were driving him with the point of their bayonets.","However, on Monday, as Gervaise had a nice little meal planned for the evening, the remains of some beans and a pint of wine, she pretended to herself that a walk would give her an appetite. The letter from the asylum which she had left lying on the bureau bothered her. The snow had melted, the day was mild and grey and on the whole fine, with just a slight keenness in the air which was invigorating. She started at noon, for her walk was a long one. She had to cross Paris and her bad leg always slowed her. With that the streets were crowded; but the people amused her; she reached her destination very pleasantly. When she had given her name, she was told a most astounding story to the effect that Coupeau had been fished out of the Seine close to the Pont-Neuf. He had jumped over the parapet, under the impression that a bearded man was barring his way. A fine jump, was it not? And as for finding out how Coupeau got to be on the Pont-Neuf, that was a matter he could not even explain himself."
"Quand le printemps fut venu, Gervaise alla se réfugier auprès de Goujet. Elle ne pouvait plus ne réfléchir à rien, sur une chaise, sans penser aussitôt à son premier amant ; elle le voyait quitter Adèle, remettre son linge au fond de leur ancienne malle, revenir chez elle, avec la malle sur la voiture. Les jours où elle sortait, elle était prise tout d'un coup de peurs bêtes, dans la rue ; elle croyait entendre le pas de Lantier derrière elle, elle n'osait pas se retourner, tremblante, s'imaginant sentir ses mains la saisir à la taille. Bien sûr, il devait l'espionner ; il tomberait sur elle une après-midi ; et cette idée lui donnait des sueurs froides, parce qu'il l'embrasserait certainement dans l'oreille, comme il le faisait par taquinerie, autrefois. C'était ce baiser qui l'épouvantait ; à l'avance, il la rendait sourde, il l'emplissait d'un bourdonnement, dans lequel elle ne distinguait plus que le bruit de son cœur battant à grands coups. Alors, dès que ces peurs la prenaient, la forge était son seul asile ; elle y redevenait tranquille et souriante, sous la protection de Goujet, dont le marteau sonore mettait en fuite ses mauvais rêves.","When spring came, Gervaise took refuge with Goujet. She could no longer think of nothing, on a chair, without immediately thinking of her first lover; she saw him leaving Adele, putting his laundry back in the bottom of their old trunk, returning home with the trunk on the car. On the days when she went out, she was suddenly seized with silly fears, in the street; she thought she heard Lantier's footsteps behind her, she dared not turn around, trembling, imagining that she felt his hands seize her around the waist. Of course, he had to spy on her; he would fall on her one afternoon; and the thought made him break into a sweat, because he would certainly kiss her in the ear, as he had teasingly used to. It was this kiss that terrified her; in advance, he made her deaf, he filled her with a buzzing, in which she could only distinguish the sound of his heart beating violently. So, as soon as these fears seized her, the forge was her only asylum; she became calm and smiling there again, under the protection of Goujet, whose sonorous hammer put her bad dreams to flight.","She imagined another day when, quitting Adèle, he might return to her—with that old familiar trunk. When she went into the street it was with a spasm of terror. She fancied that every step behind her was Lantier's. She dared not look around lest his hand should glide about her waist. He might be watching for her at any time. He might come to her door in the afternoon, and this idea brought a cold sweat to her forehead, because he would certainly kiss her on her ear as he had often teased her by doing in the years gone by. It was this kiss she dreaded. Its dull reverberation deafened her to all outside sounds, and she could hear only the beatings of her own heart. When these terrors assailed her the forge was her only asylum, from whence she returned smiling and serene, feeling that Goujet, whose sonorous hammer had put all her bad dreams to flight, would protect her always.","As soon as spring came Gervaise often went and sought refuge with Goujet. She could no longer sit musing on a chair without immediately thinking of her first lover; she pictured him leaving Adele, packing his clothes in the bottom of their old trunk, and returning to her in a cab. The days when she went out, she was seized with the most foolish fears in the street; she was ever thinking she heard Lantier’s footsteps behind her. She did not dare turn round, but tremblingly fancied she felt his hands seizing her round the waist. He was, no doubt, spying upon her; he would appear before her some afternoon; and the bare idea threw her into a cold perspiration, because he would to a certainty kiss her on the ear, as he used to do in former days solely to tease her. It was this kiss which frightened her; it rendered her deaf beforehand; it filled her with a buzzing amidst which she could only distinguish the sound of her heart beating violently. So, as soon as these fears seized upon her, the forge was her only shelter; there, under Goujet’s protection, she once more became easy and smiling, as his sonorous hammer drove away her disagreeable reflections."
"Et, se tournant, il cria de sa voix qui sonnait le cuivre fêlé :","And, turning, he cried in his voice which sounded like cracked copper:",Gervaise obeyed his instructions and found herself in a large room with the forge at the farther end.,"And turning round he called out at the top of his voice, which had a sound of cracked brass:"
- En voilà des cafards ! grogna Mes-Bottes. Ça doit licher dans les coins.,- There are cockroaches! growled My-Boots. It must lick in the corners.,"""Milksops!"" muttered Mes-Bottes. ""They had best pass their lives in the corner by the fire!""",“There are hypocrites for you!” grunted My-Boots. “I bet they have their drinks on the sly.”
"Gervaise, cependant, se retenait pour ne pas éclater en sanglots. Elle tendait les mains, avec le désir de soulager l'enfant ; et, comme le lambeau de drap glissait, elle voulut le rabattre et arranger le lit. Alors, le pauvre petit corps de la mourante apparut. Ah ! Seigneur ! quelle misère et quelle pitié ! Les pierres auraient pleuré. Lalie était toute nue, un reste de camisole aux épaules en guise de chemise ; oui, toute nue, et d'une nudité saignante et douloureuse de martyre. Elle n'avait plus de chair, les os trouaient la peau. Sur les côtes, de minces zébrures violettes descendaient jusqu'aux cuisses, les cinglements du fouet imprimés là tout vifs. Une tache livide cerclait le bras gauche, comme si la mâchoire d'un étau avait broyé ce membre si tendre, pas plus gros qu'une allumette. La jambe droite montrait une déchirure mal fermée, quelque mauvais coup rouvert chaque matin en trottant pour faire le ménage. Des pieds à la tête, elle n'était qu'un noir. Oh ! ce massacre de l'enfance, ces lourdes pattes d'homme écrasant cet amour de quiqui, cette abomination de tant de faiblesse râlant sous une pareille croix ! On adore dans les églises des saintes fouettées dont la nudité est moins pure. Gervaise, de nouveau, s'était accroupie, ne songeant plus à tirer le drap, renversée par la vue de ce rien du tout pitoyable, aplati au fond du lit ; et ses lèvres tremblantes cherchaient des prières.","Gervaise, however, held herself back so as not to burst into tears. She stretched out her hands, with the desire to relieve the child; and, as the shred of sheet slipped, she wanted to fold it back and arrange the bed. Then the poor little body of the dying woman appeared. Ah! Lord ! what misery and what pity! The stones would have wept. Lalie was completely naked, the remnants of a camisole around her shoulders instead of a shirt; yes, quite naked, and with the bloody and painful nudity of martyrdom. She had no more flesh, the bones pierced the skin. On the ribs, thin purple welts descended to the thighs, the lashing of the whip imprinted there quite vividly. A livid spot surrounded the left arm, as if the jaws of a vice had crushed this member so tender, no bigger than a match. The right leg showed a badly closed tear, some bad cut reopened each morning while trotting to do the housework. From head to toe, she was just a black guy. Oh ! this massacre of childhood, these heavy paws of man crushing this love of quiqui, this abomination of so much weakness gasping under such a cross! We adore in the churches whipped saints whose nudity is less pure. Once again Gervaise had crouched down, no longer dreaming of pulling up the sheet, bowled over by the sight of that pitiful nothing at all, flattened at the bottom of the bed; and her trembling lips sought prayers.","Gervaise tried to keep back her tears. She held Lalie's hands, and as the bedclothes slipped away she rearranged them. In doing so she caught a glimpse of the poor little figure. The sight might have drawn tears from a stone. Lalie wore only a tiny chemise over her bruised and bleeding flesh; marks of a lash striped her sides; a livid spot was on her right arm, and from head to foot she was one bruise. Gervaise was paralyzed at the sight. She wondered, if there were a God above, how He could have allowed the child to stagger under so heavy a cross. ""Madame Coupeau,"" murmured the child, trying to draw the sheet over her.","Gervaise restrained herself not to burst out sobbing. She extended her hands, desirous of easing the child, and as the shred of a sheet was falling, she wished to tack it up and arrange the bed. Then the dying girl’s poor little body was seen. Ah! Mon Dieu! what misery! What woe! Stones would have wept. Lalie was bare, with only the remnants of a camisole on her shoulders by way of chemise; yes, bare, with the grievous, bleeding nudity of a martyr. She had no flesh left; her bones seemed to protrude through the skin. From her ribs to her thighs there extended a number of violet stripes—the marks of the whip forcibly imprinted on her. A livid bruise, moreover, encircled her left arm, as if the tender limb, scarcely larger than a lucifer, had been crushed in a vise. There was also an imperfectly closed wound on her right leg, left there by some ugly blow and which opened again and again of a morning, when she went about doing her errands. From head to foot, indeed, she was but one bruise! Oh! this murdering of childhood; those heavy hands crushing this lovely girl; how abominable that such weakness should have such a weighty cross to bear! Again did Gervaise crouch down, no longer thinking of tucking in the sheet, but overwhelmed by the pitiful sight of this martyrdom; and her trembling lips seemed to be seeking for words of prayer."
"- Moi, je monterais volontiers, disait madame Lerat, mais je ne veux pas qu'il y ait d'homme derrière moi.","- I would gladly go upstairs, said Madame Lerat, but I don't want there to be a man behind me.","""It is not a bad idea,"" cried the men.","“I’ll go up with pleasure,” said Madame Lerat, “ but I won’t have any men walking behind me.”"
"- Qu'est-ce qu'elle a donc à espionner, cette bique ! dit madame Boche. Une fichue mine !","- What does she have to spy on, this bitch! said Madame Boche. A damn mine!","The old woman still stood at the window, looking up at the roof and waiting. ""Just see her,"" said Mme Boche. ""What is she looking at?""","“Whatever can she have to look at, that old she-goat?” said Madame Boche. “What a mug she has!”"
"- Alors, demain, si ça te plaît, dit son mari. Tu viendras me prendre vers six heures à la maison où je travaille, rue de la Nation, et nous passerons rue de la Goutte-d'Or, en rentrant.","- So, tomorrow, if you like, said her husband. Around six o'clock, you'll pick me up from the house where I work, rue de la Nation, and we'll pass rue de la Goutte-d'Or on your way home.","""We can go tomorrow if you say so,"" was her husband's reply; ""you can call for me at six o'clock.""","“Very well, then, to-morrow, if you like,” said her husband. “You can come and fetch me towards six o’clock at the house where I’m working, in the Rue de la Nation, and we’ll call in at the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or on our way home.”"
- Je suis venu pour les deux loyers arriérés. Êtes-vous en mesure ?,- I came for the two back rents. Are you able?,"""I came for the two quarters that are due. Have you got the money for me?""",“I have come for the two quarters’ rent that’s overdue. Are you prepared to pay?”
"- Monsieur, écoutez donc ?","- Sir, are you listening?","""Sir,"" she said in a low voice, ""please listen to me.""","“Sir, listen a moment—”"
"- Eh bien ! il n'y a plus personne ? reprit Bazouge dans le silence. Attendez, on est complaisant pour les dames.","- Well ! there is not anybody ? resumed Bazouge in silence. Wait, we're complacent on the ladies.","""No! No! It is nothing!"" answered the laundress in a choked voice.","“Well! is there no one there now?” resumed Bazouge in silence. “Wait a bit, we’re always ready to oblige the ladies.”"
"Mais elle ne parut pas l'entendre, elle continua :","But she did not seem to hear him, she continued:",She did not heed his word but continued:,"Apparently not listening, Gervaise went on with her own thought."
"- Je n'ai pas pu fermer l'œil ? Je croyais qu'on t'avait donné un mauvais coup ? Où es-tu allé ? où as-tu passé la nuit ? Mon Dieu ! ne recommence pas, je deviendrais folle ? Dis, Auguste, où es-tu allé ?","- I couldn't sleep a wink? I thought you were given a bad shot? Where did you go ? where did you spend the night? My God ! don't do it again, am I going crazy? Say, Auguste, where did you go?","""I have not closed my eyes—I thought you were killed! Where have you been all night? I feel as if I were going mad! Tell me, Auguste, where have you been?""","Gervaise, who had fallen back on her chair, gently complained, in short sentences: “I’ve not had a wink of sleep. I feared some harm had happened to you. Where have you been? Where did you spend the night? For heaven’s sake! Don’t do it again, or I shall go crazy. Tell me Auguste, where have you been?”"
"- Il dort, murmura le médecin en chef.","""He's asleep,"" muttered the chief physician.","""He is asleep,"" said the surgeon in chief, turning to his colleagues.","“He’s sleeping,” murmured the head doctor."
"C'était une vraie tempête. Sur ces hauteurs, au milieu de ces espaces largement ouverts, la neige fine tournoyait, semblait soufflée à la fois des quatre points du ciel. On ne voyait pas à dix pas, tout se noyait dans cette poussière volante. Le quartier avait disparu, le boulevard paraissait mort, comme si la rafale venait de jeter le silence de son drap blanc sur les hoquets des derniers ivrognes. Gervaise, péniblement, allait toujours, aveuglée, perdue. Elle touchait les arbres pour se retrouver. A mesure qu'elle avançait, les becs de gaz sortaient de la pâleur de l'air, pareils à des torches éteintes. Puis, tout d'un coup, lorsqu'elle traversait un carrefour, ces lueurs elles-mêmes manquaient ; elle était prise et roulée dans un tourbillon blafard, sans distinguer rien qui pût la guider. Sous elle, le sol fuyait, d'une blancheur vague. Des murs gris l'enfermaient. Et, quand elle s'arrêtait, hésitante, tournant la tête, elle devinait, derrière ce voile de glace, l'immensité des avenues, les files interminables des becs de gaz, tout cet infini noir et désert de Paris endormi.","It was a real storm. On these heights, in the middle of these wide open spaces, the fine snow was whirling, seemed to be blown at the same time from the four points of the sky. You couldn't see ten paces away, everything was drowning in this flying dust. The neighborhood had disappeared, the boulevard seemed dead, as if the gust had just cast the silence of its white sheet over the gasps of the last drunkards. Gervaise, painfully, continued on, blinded, lost. She touched the trees to find herself. As she advanced, the gaslights emerged from the pallor of the air, like extinguished torches. Then, all of a sudden, when she was crossing a crossroads, these very lights were missing; she was caught and rolled in a pale whirlwind, without distinguishing anything that could guide her. Beneath her, the ground receded, vaguely white. Gray walls enclosed him. And when she stopped, hesitantly, turning her head, she guessed, behind this veil of ice, the immensity of the avenues, the endless rows of gaslights, all this dark and deserted infinity of sleeping Paris.","They looked at each other once more, and without a word each went their own way through the fast-falling snow, which blinded Gervaise as she struggled on, the wind wrapping her thin skirts around her legs so that she could hardly walk.","It was a perfect tempest. On these heights, in the midst of this open space, the fine snow revolved round and round as if the wind came from the four corners of heaven. You could not see ten paces off, everything was confused in the midst of this flying dust. The surroundings had disappeared, the Boulevard seemed to be dead, as if the storm had stretched the silence of its white sheet over the hiccoughs of the last drunkards. Gervaise still went on, blinded, lost. She felt her way by touching the trees. As she advanced the gas-lamps shone out amidst the whiteness like torches. Then, suddenly, whenever she crossed an open space, these lights failed her; she was enveloped in the whirling snow, unable to distinguish anything to guide her. Below stretched the ground, vaguely white; grey walls surrounded her, and when she paused, hesitating and turning her head, she divined that behind this icy veil extended the immense avenue with interminable vistas of gas-lamps—the black and deserted Infinite of Paris asleep."
"Elle le regarda, ne comprenant pas nettement d'abord, surprise par cette rude déclaration d'un amour dont il n'avait jamais ouvert les lèvres.","She looked at him, not clearly understanding at first, surprised by this harsh declaration of a love he had never opened his lips to.","She looked at him, not understanding him but impressed by this abrupt declaration of a love from him, who had never before opened his lips in regard to it.","She didn’t understand at first and stared at him, startled by this sudden declaration of a love that he had never mentioned. Finally she asked:"
"Puis, en montant les six étages, dans l'obscurité, elle ne put s'empêcher de rire ; un vilain rire, qui lui faisait du mal. Elle se souvenait de son idéal, anciennement : travailler tranquille, manger toujours du pain, avoir un trou un peu propre pour dormir, bien élever ses enfants, ne pas être battue, mourir dans son lit. Non, vrai, c'était comique, comme tout ça se réalisait ! Elle ne travaillait plus, elle ne mangeait plus, elle dormait sur l'ordure, sa fille courait le guilledou, son mari lui flanquait des tatouilles ; il ne lui restait qu'à crever sur le pavé, et ce serait tout de suite, si elle trouvait le courage de se flanquer par la fenêtre, en rentrant chez elle. N'aurait-on pas dit qu'elle avait demandé au ciel trente mille francs de rente et des égards ? Ah ! vrai, dans cette vie, on a beau être modeste, on peut se fouiller ! Pas même la pâtée et la niche, voilà le sort commun. Et ce qui redoublait son mauvais rire, c'était de se rappeler son bel espoir de se retirer à la campagne, après vingt ans de repassage. Eh bien ! elle y allait, à la campagne. Elle voulait son coin de verdure au Père-Lachaise.","Then, climbing the six flights of stairs, in the dark, she couldn't help laughing; a nasty laugh, which hurt him. She remembered her ideal, formerly: to work quietly, to always eat bread, to have a somewhat clean hole to sleep in, to bring up her children well, not to be beaten, to die in her bed. No, really, it was comical, how it all happened! She no longer worked, she no longer ate, she slept on filth, her daughter ran the guilledou, her husband gave her tattoos; there was nothing left for her but to die on the pavement, and it would be right away, if she found the courage to throw herself out of the window on her way home. Wouldn't one have said that she had asked Heaven for thirty thousand francs a year and consideration? Ah! true, in this life, we may be modest, we can search ourselves! Not even the mash and the kennel, that's the common fate. And what redoubled his nasty laughter was remembering his fine hope of retiring to the country, after twenty years of ironing. Well ! she was going there, to the country. She wanted her corner of greenery at Père-Lachaise.","As she toiled up the six long flights in the darkness she laughed aloud. She recalled her old dream—to work quietly, have plenty to eat, a little home to herself, where she could bring up her children, never to be beaten, and to die in her bed! It was droll how things had turned out. She worked no more; she had nothing to eat; she lived amid dirt and disorder. Her daughter had gone to the bad, and her husband beat her whenever he pleased. As for dying in her bed, she had none. Should she throw herself out of the window and find one on the pavement below? She had not been unreasonable in her wishes, surely. She had not asked of heaven an income of thirty thousand francs or a carriage and horses. This was a queer world! And then she laughed again as she remembered that she had once said that after she had worked for twenty years she would retire into the country. Yes, she would go into the country, for she should soon have her little green corner in Père-Lachaise.","Then, whilst ascending the six flights of stairs in the dark, she could not prevent herself from laughing; an ugly laugh which hurt her. She recalled her ideal of former days: to work quietly, always have bread to eat and a tidy house to sleep in, to bring up her children, not to be beaten and to die in her bed. No, really, it was comical how all that was becoming realized! She no longer worked , she no longer ate, she slept on filth, her husband frequented all sorts of wineshops, and her husband drubbed her at all hours of the day; all that was left for her to do was to die on the pavement, and it would not take long if on getting into her room, she could only pluck up courage to fling herself out of the window. Was it not enough to make one think that she had hoped to earn thirty thousand francs a year, and no end of respect? Ah! really, in this life it is no use being modest; one only gets sat upon. Not even pap and a nest , that is the common lot. What increased her ugly laugh was the recollection of her grand hope of retiring into the country after twenty years passed in ironing. Well! she was on her way to the country. She was going to have her green corner in the Pere-Lachaise cemetery."
"- Tu veux donc que je vole, murmura-t-elle d'une voix sourde.","- So you want me to fly, she whispered in a low voice.",Mes-Bottes smoothed his chin and said in a conciliatory voice:,"she muttered, in a dull voice."
"Personne n'osait se risquer dans la chambre, parce qu'on connaissait Bijard, une bête brute quand il était soûl. Il ne dessoûlait jamais, d'ailleurs. Les rares jours où il travaillait, il posait un litre d'eau-de-vie près de son étau de serrurier, buvant au goulot toutes les demi-heures. Il ne se soutenait plus autrement, il aurait pris feu comme une torche, si l'on avait approché une allumette de sa bouche.","No one dared venture into the room, because we knew Bijard, a brute beast when he was drunk. He never sobered up, anyway. On the rare days he worked, he would put a liter of brandy near his locksmith's vice, drinking from the bottle every half hour. He couldn't hold himself otherwise, he would have caught fire like a torch if a match had been put near his mouth.","No one dared enter the room, because Bijard was well known to be like a madman when he was tipsy. He was rarely thoroughly sober, and on the occasional days when he condescended to work he always had a bottle of brandy at his side. He rarely ate anything, and if a match had been touched to his mouth he would have taken fire like a torch.","No one dared to venture inside the room, because it was known that Bijard was like a brute beast when he was drunk. As a matter of fact, he was scarcely ever sober. The rare days on which he worked, he placed a bottle of brandy beside his blacksmith’s vise, gulping some of it down every half hour. He could not keep himself going any other way. He would have blazed away like a torch if anyone had placed a lighted match close to his mouth."
"- Madame ! madame ! cria Clémence, faites-le tenir tranquille, à la fin ! ? Je m'en vais, si ça continue. Je ne veux pas être insultée.","- Mrs ! madam ! Cried Clemence, keep him quiet at the end! ? I'm leaving, if this continues. I don't want to be insulted.",Gervaise undressed her husband and tucked him up in bed as if he had been a child and then returned to her fluting irons in time to still a grand dispute that was going on about an iron that had not been properly cleaned.,"“Madame! Madame!” cried Clemence, “do make him leave off! I shall go away if it continues. I won’t be intimated.”"
"Gervaise traîna ses savates dans le corridor, alourdie, pliant les épaules. Quand elle fut à sa porte, elle n'entra pas, sa chambre lui faisait peur. Autant marcher, elle aurait plus chaud et prendrait patience. En passant, elle allongea le cou dans la niche du père Bru, sous l'escalier ; encore un, celui-là, qui devait avoir un bel appétit, car il déjeunait et dînait par cœur depuis trois jours ; mais il n'était pas là, il n'y avait que son trou, et elle éprouva une jalousie, en s'imaginant qu'on pouvait l'avoir invité quelque part. Puis, comme elle arrivait devant les Bijard, elle entendit des plaintes, elle entra, la clef étant toujours sur la serrure.","Gervaise dragged her slippers down the corridor, weighed down, bending her shoulders. When she was at his door, she did not enter, her room frightened her. Might as well walk, she would be warmer and would take patience. As she passed, she stretched her neck in Father Bru's niche under the stairs; another, that one, who must have had a fine appetite, for he had been breakfasting and dining by heart for three days; but he wasn't there, there was only his hole, and she felt jealous, imagining that he might have been invited somewhere. Then, as she arrived in front of the Bijards, she heard complaints, she entered, the key still being in the lock.","Gervaise crawled down the corridor with slipshod shoes and slouching shoulders, but at her door she hesitated; she could not go in: she was afraid. She would walk up and down a little—that would keep her warm. As she passed she looked in at Father Bru, but to her surprise he was not there, and she asked herself with a pang of jealousy if anyone could possibly have asked him out to dine. When she reached the Bijards' she heard a groan.","Gervaise shuffled along the passage in her slippers, bending her back and feeling heavy. On reaching her door she did not open it—her room frightened her. It would be better to walk about, she would learn patience. As she passed by she stretched out her neck, peering into Pere Bru’s kennel under the stairs. There, for instance, was another one who must have a fine appetite, for he had breakfasted and dined by heart during the last three days. However, he wasn’t at home, there was only his hole, and Gervaise felt somewhat jealous, thinking that perhaps he had been invited somewhere. Then, as she reached the Bijards’ she heard Lalie moaning, and, as the key was in the lock as usual, she opened the door and went in."
"- Je ne sais rien, là, quand je vous le dis !",- I don't know anything when I tell you!,"""I tell you I know nothing whatever, nothing more than I tell you!""","“I know nothing, I mean it when I say so!”"
"Alors, dès que ces pensées la prenaient, Gervaise regardait dans les rues avec des yeux de gendarme. Ah ! si elle avait aperçu son ordure, comme elle l'aurait raccompagnée à la maison ! On bouleversait le quartier, cette année-là. On perçait le boulevard Magenta et le boulevard Ornano, qui emportaient l'ancienne barrière Poissonnière et trouaient le boulevard extérieur. C'était à ne plus s'y reconnaître. Tout un côté de la rue des Poissonniers était par terre. Maintenant, de la rue de la Goutte-d'Or, on voyait une immense éclaircie, un coup de soleil et d'air libre ; et, à la place des masures qui bouchaient la vue de ce côté, s'élevait, sur le boulevard Ornano, un vrai monument, une maison à six étages, sculptée comme une église, dont les fenêtres claires, tendues de rideaux brodés, sentaient la richesse. Cette maison-là, toute blanche, posée juste en face de la rue, semblait l'éclairer d'une enfilade de lumière. Même, chaque jour, elle faisait disputer Lantier et Poisson. Le chapelier ne tarissait pas sur les démolitions de Paris ; il accusait l'empereur de mettre partout des palais, pour renvoyer les ouvriers en province ; et le sergent de ville, pâle d'une colère froide, répondait qu'au contraire l'empereur songeait d'abord aux ouvriers, qu'il raserait Paris, s'il le fallait, dans le seul but de leur donner du travail. Gervaise, elle aussi, se montrait ennuyée de ces embellissements, qui lui dérangeaient le coin noir de faubourg auquel elle était accoutumée. Son ennui venait de ce que, précisément, le quartier s'embellissait à l'heure où elle-même tournait à la ruine. On n'aime pas, quand on est dans la crotte, recevoir un rayon en plein sur la tête. Aussi, les jours où elle cherchait Nana, rageait-elle d'enjamber des matériaux, de patauger le long des trottoirs en construction, de buter contre des palissades. La belle bâtisse du boulevard Ornano la mettait hors des gonds. Des bâtisses pareilles, c'était pour des catins comme Nana.","So, as soon as these thoughts took hold of her, Gervaise looked out into the streets with the eyes of a policeman. Ah! if she had seen his filth, how she would have accompanied him home! We were turning the neighborhood upside down that year. Boulevard Magenta and Boulevard Ornano were pierced, carrying the old Poissonnière barrier and piercing the outer boulevard. It was to no longer identify with it. A whole side of the rue des Poissonniers was on the ground. Now, from the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or, one could see an immense clearing, a burst of sunshine and free air; and, in place of the hovels which obstructed the view on that side, rose, on the Boulevard Ornano, a real monument, a six-storey house, sculpted like a church, whose light windows, hung with embroidered curtains, smelled the wealth. That house, all white, placed just opposite the street, seemed to illuminate it with a string of light. Even, every day, she made Lantier and Poisson argue. The hatter did not stop talking about the demolitions of Paris; he accused the Emperor of placing palaces everywhere, to send the workmen back to the provinces; and the Sergeant de Ville, pale with cold anger, replied that, on the contrary, the Emperor was thinking first of all of the workmen, that he would raze Paris, if necessary, for the sole purpose of giving them work. Gervaise, too, seemed bored by these embellishments, which disturbed the black corner of the suburb to which she was accustomed. Her boredom came precisely from the fact that the neighborhood was becoming more beautiful at a time when she herself was turning to ruin. We do not like, when we are in the dirt, to receive a ray right on the head. Also, on the days when she was looking for Nana, she hated stepping over materials, wading along sidewalks under construction, bumping into palisades. The handsome building on Boulevard Ornano threw her off the hinges. Such buildings were for whores like Nana.","She roamed the streets day after day, night after night, hoping to see the girl. That year half the Quartier was being demolished. All one side of the Rue des Poissonnièrs lay flat on the ground. Lantier and Poisson disputed day after day on these demolitions. The one declared that the emperor wanted to build palaces and drive the lower classes out of Paris, while Poisson, white with rage, said the emperor would pull down the whole of Paris merely to give work to the people. Gervaise did not like the improvements, either, or the changes in the dingy Quartier, to which she was accustomed. It was, in fact, a little hard for her to see all these embellishments just when she was going downhill so fast over the piles of brick and mortar, while she was wandering about in search of Nana.","Whenever these thoughts came over her, Gervaise looked on all sides in the streets with the eyes of a detective. Ah! if she had only seen her little sinner, how quickly she would have brought her home again! The neighborhood was being turned topsy-turvy that year. The Boulevard Magenta and the Boulevard Ornano were being pierced; they were doing away with the old Barriere Poissonniere and cutting right through the outer Boulevard. The district could not be recognized. The whole of one side of the Rue des Poissonniers had been pulled down. From the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or a large clearing could now be seen, a dash of sunlight and open air; and in place of the gloomy buildings which had hidden the view in this direction there rose up on the Boulevard Ornano a perfect monument, a six-storied house, carved all over like a church, with clear windows, which, with their embroidered curtains, seemed symbolical of wealth. This white house, standing just in front of the street, illuminated it with a jet of light, as it were, and every day it caused discussions between Lantier and Poisson. Gervaise had several times had tidings of Nana."
"L'emménagement eut lieu tout de suite. Gervaise, les premiers jours, éprouvait des joies d'enfant, quand elle traversait la rue, en rentrant d'une commission. Elle s'attardait, souriait à son chez elle. De loin, au milieu de la file noire des autres devantures, sa boutique lui apparaissait toute claire, d'une gaieté neuve, avec son enseigne bleu tendre, où les mots : Blanchisseuse de fin, étaient peints en grandes lettres jaunes. Dans la vitrine, fermée au fond par des petits rideaux de mousseline, tapissée de papier bleu pour faire valoir la blancheur du linge, des chemises d'homme restaient en montre, des bonnets de femme pendaient, les brides nouées à des fils de laiton. Et elle trouvait sa boutique jolie, couleur du ciel. Dedans, on entrait encore dans du bleu ; le papier qui imitait une perse Pompadour, représentait une treille où couraient des liserons ; l'établi une immense table tenant les deux tiers de la pièce, garni d'une épaisse couverture, se drapait d'un bout de cretonne à grands ramages bleuâtres, pour cacher les tréteaux. Gervaise s'asseyait sur un tabouret, soufflait un peu de contentement, heureuse de cette belle propreté, couvant des yeux ses outils neufs. Mais son premier regard allait toujours à sa mécanique, un poêle de fonte, où dix fers pouvaient chauffer à la fois, rangés autour du foyer, sur des plaques obliques. Elle venait se mettre à genoux, regardait avec la continuelle peur que sa petite bête d'apprentie ne fit éclater la fonte, en fourrant trop de coke.","The move took place immediately. Gervaise, for the first few days, felt the joys of a child when she crossed the street on her way home from an errand. She lingered, smiling at her home. From afar, in the middle of the black line of other storefronts, her shop appeared to her quite bright, with a new gaiety, with its soft blue sign, on which the words Laundress of the End were painted in large yellow letters. In the window, closed at the back by small muslin curtains, lined with blue paper to show off the whiteness of the linen, men's shirts remained on display, women's caps hung, the straps tied with brass threads. And she thought her shop was pretty, the color of the sky. Inside, we were still entering blue; the paper, which imitated a Persian Pompadour, represented a trellis over which ran bindweed; the workbench an immense table covering two-thirds of the room, furnished with a thick blanket, was draped with a piece of cretonne with large bluish foliage, to hide the trestles. Gervaise sat down on a stool, sighed a little with satisfaction, happy with this beautiful cleanliness, gazing at her new tools. But his first glance always went to its mechanics, a cast-iron stove, where ten irons could heat at the same time, ranged around the hearth, on oblique plates. She came to her knees, watched with the continual fear that her little beast of an apprentice would burst the cast iron, by stuffing too much coke.","Then came the moving, and finally Gervaise called herself settled in her new home and was pleased as a child. As she came up the street she could see her sign afar off: CLEARSTARCHER LACES AND EMBROIDERIES DONE UP WITH ESPECIAL CARE The first word was painted in large yellow letters on a pale blue ground. In the recessed window shut in at the back by muslin curtains lay men's shirts, delicate handkerchiefs and cuffs; all these were on blue paper, and Gervaise was charmed. When she entered the door all was blue there; the paper represented a golden trellis and blue morning-glories. In the center was a huge table draped with blue-bordered cretonne to hide the trestles. Gervaise seated herself and looked round, happy in the cleanliness of all about her. Her first glance, however, was directed to her stove, a sort of furnace whereon ten irons could be heated at once. It was a source of constant anxiety lest her little apprentice should fill it too full of coal and so injure it.","The moving in took place at once. During the first few days Gervaise felt as delighted as a child. Whenever she crossed the road on returning from some errand, she lingered to smile at her home. From a distance her shop appeared light and gay with its pale blue signboard, on which the word “Laundress” was painted in big yellow letters, amidst the dark row of the other frontages. In the window, closed in behind by little muslin curtains, and hung on either side with blue paper to show off the whiteness of the linen, some shirts were displayed, with some women’s caps hanging above them on wires. She thought her shop looked pretty, being the same color as the heavens. Inside there was more blue; the paper, in imitation of a Pompadour chintz, represented a trellis overgrown with morning-glories. A huge table, taking up two-thirds of the room, was her ironing-table. It was covered with thick blanketing and draped with a strip of cretonne patterned with blue flower sprays that hid the trestles beneath. Gervaise was enchanted with her pretty establishment and would often seat herself on a stool and sigh with contentment, delighted with all the new equipment. Her first glance always went to the cast-iron stove where the irons were heated ten at a time, arranged over the heat on slanting rests. She would kneel down to look into the stove to make sure the apprentice had not put in too much coke."
"Et elle traversa en courant la chambre de madame Goujet, elle se retrouva sur le pavé. Quand elle revint à elle, elle avait sonné rue de la Goutte-d'Or, Boche tirait le cordon. La maison était toute sombre. Elle entra là-dedans, comme dans son deuil. A cette heure de nuit, le porche, béant et délabré, semblait une gueule ouverte. Dire que jadis elle avait ambitionné un coin de cette carcasse de caserne ! Ses oreilles étaient donc bouchées, qu'elle n'entendait pas à cette époque la sacrée musique de désespoir qui ronflait derrière les murs ! Depuis le jour où elle y avait fichu les pieds, elle s'était mise à dégringoler. Oui, ça devait porter malheur d'être ainsi les uns sur les autres, dans ces grandes gueuses de maisons ouvrières ; on y attrapait le choléra de la misère. Ce soir-là, tout le monde paraissait crevé. Elle écoutait seulement les Boche ronfler, à droite ; tandis que Lantier et Virginie, à gauche, faisaient un ronron, comme des chats qui ne dorment pas et qui ont chaud, les yeux fermés. Dans la cour, elle se crut au milieu d'un vrai cimetière ; la neige faisait par terre un carré pâle ; les hautes façades montaient, d'un gris livide, sans une lumière, pareilles à des pans de ruine ; et pas un soupir, l'ensevelissement de tout un village raidi de froid et de faim. Il lui fallut enjamber un ruisseau noir, une mare lâchée par la teinturerie, fumant et s'ouvrant un lit boueux dans la blancheur de la neige. C'était une eau couleur de ses pensées. Elles avaient coulé, les belles eaux bleu tendre et rose tendre !","And she ran across Madame Goujet's room, she found herself on the pavement. When she came to, she had rung the bell in the rue de la Goutte-d'Or, Boche was pulling the cord. The house was quite dark. She entered into it, as in her mourning. At this hour of the night, the porch, gaping and dilapidated, looked like an open mouth. To think that she had longed for a corner of this barracks carcass! Her ears were so blocked, that she could not hear at that time the sacred music of despair which rumbled behind the walls! Since the day she had set foot there, she had started to tumble. Yes, it must have been bad luck to be on top of each other like that, in those big tramps of workers' houses; people caught the cholera of misery there. That evening, everyone seemed exhausted. She only listened to the Boche snoring on the right; while Lantier and Virginie, on the left, were purring like cats who are not sleeping and who are hot, with their eyes closed. In the yard, she thought she was in the middle of a real cemetery; the snow made a pale square on the ground; the high facades rose, of a livid gray, without a light, like sections of ruin; and not a sigh, the burial of an entire village stiff with cold and hunger. He had to step over a black stream, a pool left by the dry cleaners, steaming and opening a muddy bed in the whiteness of the snow. It was water the color of his thoughts. They had flowed, the beautiful soft blue and soft pink waters!","And she rushed through Mme Goujet's room and then through the street to her home. The house was all dark, and the arched door into the courtyard looked like huge, gaping jaws. Could this be the house where she once desired to reside? Had she been deaf in those days, not to have heard that wail of despair which pervaded the place from top to bottom? From the day when she first set her foot within the house she had steadily gone downhill. Yes, it was a frightful way to live—so many people herded together, to become the prey of cholera or vice. She looked at the courtyard and fancied it a cemetery surrounded by high walls. The snow lay white within it. She stepped over the usual stream from the dyer's, but this time the stream was black and opened for itself a path through the white snow. The stream was the color of her thoughts. But she remembered when both were rosy.","And she darted through Madame Goujet’s room and found herself outside on the pavement again. When she recovered her senses she had rung at the door in the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or and Boche was pulling the string. The house was quite dark, and in the black night the yawning, dilapidated porch looked like an open mouth. To think that she had been ambitious of having a corner in this barracks! Had her ears been stopped up then, that she had not heard the cursed music of despair which sounded behind the walls? Since she had set foot in the place she had begun to go down hill. Yes, it must bring bad luck to shut oneself up in these big workmen’s houses; the cholera of misery was contagious there. That night everyone seemed to have kicked the bucket. She only heard the Boches snoring on the right-hand side, while Lantier and Virginie on the left were purring like a couple of cats who were not asleep, but have their eyes closed and feel warm. In the courtyard she fancied she was in a perfect cemetery; the snow paved the ground with white; the high frontages, livid grey in tint, rose up unlighted like ruined walls, and not a sigh could be heard. It seemed as if a whole village, stiffened with cold and hunger, were buried here. She had to step over a black gutter—water from the dye-works—which smoked and streaked the whiteness of the snow with its muddy course. It was the color of her thoughts. The beautiful light blue and light pink waters had long since flowed away."
Chapitre 13,Chapter 13,CHAPTER XIII,CHAPTER XIII
"La veillée commença. Coupeau s'était allongé, pas pour dormir, disait-il, pour réfléchir ; et il ronflait cinq minutes après. Lorsqu'on envoya Nana coucher chez les Boche, elle pleura ; elle se régalait depuis le matin, à l'espoir d'avoir bien chaud dans le grand lit de son bon ami Lantier. Les Poisson restèrent jusqu'à minuit. On avait fini par faire du vin à la française, dans un saladier, parce que le café donnait trop sur les nerfs de ces dames. La conversation tournait aux effusions tendres. Virginie parlait de la campagne : elle aurait voulu être enterrée au coin d'un bois, avec des fleurs des champs sur sa tombe. Madame Lerat gardait déjà, dans son armoire, le drap pour l'ensevelir, et elle le parfumait toujours d'un bouquet de lavande ; elle tenait à avoir une bonne odeur sous le nez, quand elle mangerait les pissenlits par la racine. Puis, sans transition, le sergent de ville raconta qu'il avait arrêté une grande belle fille le matin, qui venait de voler dans la boutique d'un charcutier ; en la déshabillant chez le commissaire, on lui avait trouvé dix saucissons pendus autour du corps, devant et derrière. Et, madame Lorilleux ayant dit d'un air de dégoût qu'elle n'en mangerait pas, de ces saucissons-là, la société s'était mise à rire doucement. La veillée s'égaya, en gardant les convenances. Mais comme on achevait le vin à la française, un bruit singulier, un ruissellement sourd, sortit du cabinet. Tous levèrent la tête, se regardèrent.","The vigil began. Coupeau had lain down, not to sleep, he said, to think; and he was snoring five minutes later. When Nana was sent to sleep with the Boches, she wept; she had been feasting since morning, hoping to be warm in her good friend Lantier's big bed. The Pisces stayed until midnight. We ended up making wine the French way, in a salad bowl, because the coffee got on the ladies' nerves too much. The conversation turned to tender effusions. Virginie was talking about the countryside: she would have liked to be buried in the corner of a wood, with wildflowers on her grave. Madame Lerat already kept the sheet in her closet to bury it, and she always perfumed it with a bouquet of lavender; she wanted to have a good smell under her nose when she ate the dandelions by the root. Then, without transition, the sergent de ville related that he had arrested a tall, beautiful girl that morning, who had just stolen from a butcher's shop; while undressing her at the superintendent's, they had found ten sausages hanging around her body, in front and behind. And, Madame Lorilleux having said with an air of disgust that she would not eat any of those sausages, the company began to laugh softly. The vigil was brightened up, keeping the proprieties. But as they were finishing the wine à la française, a strange noise, a dull trickling, came from the cabinet. All raised their heads, looked at each other.","Nana cried vociferously when she was sent into the Boche quarters to sleep; the Poissons remained until midnight. Virginia began to talk of the country: she would like to be buried under a tree with flowers and grass on her grave. Mme Lerat said that in her wardrobe—folded up in lavender—was the linen sheet in which her body was to be wrapped. When the Poissons went away Lantier accompanied them in order, he said, to leave his bed for the ladies, who could take turns in sleeping there.","The wake commenced. Coupeau had gone to lie down, not to sleep, said he, but to think; and five minutes afterwards he was snoring. When they sent Nana off to sleep at the Boches’ she cried; she had been looking forward ever since the morning to being nice and warm in her good friend Lantier’s big bed. The Poissons stayed till midnight. Some hot wine had been made in a salad-bowl because the coffee affected the ladies’ nerves too much. The conversation became tenderly effusive. Virginie talked of the country: she would like to be buried at the corner of a wood with wild flowers on her grave. Madame Lerat had already put by in her wardrobe the sheet for her shroud, and she kept it perfumed with a bunch of lavender; she wished always to have a nice smell under her nose when she would be eating the dandelions by the roots. Then, with no sort of transition, the policeman related that he had arrested a fine girl that morning who had been stealing from a pork-butcher’s shop; on undressing her at the commissary of police’s they had found ten sausages hanging round her body. And Madame Lorilleux having remarked, with a look of disgust, that she would not eat any of those sausages, the party burst into a gentle laugh. The wake became livelier, though not ceasing to preserve appearances. But just as they were finishing the hot wine a peculiar noise, a dull trickling sound, issued from the little room. All raised their heads and looked at each other."
"- Clémence, remettez votre camisole, dit Gervaise. Madame Putois a raison, ce n'est pas convenable ? On prendrait ma maison pour ce qu'elle n'est pas.","- Clemence, put your jacket back on, said Gervaise. Madame Putois is right, it is not appropriate? People would take my house for what it is not.","""Clémence, put on your sack,"" said Gervaise. "" Madame Putois is right—it is not proper.""","“Clemence, put your wrapper on again,” said Gervaise. “Madame Putois is right, it isn’t decent. People will begin to take my house for what it isn’t.”"
"Et comme elle lui demandait si le poignet ne s'engourdissait pas à la fin de la journée, il eut un bon rire. Est-ce qu'elle le croyait une demoiselle ? Son poignet en avait vu de grises depuis quinze ans ; il était devenu en fer, tant il s'était frotté aux outils. D'ailleurs, elle avait raison : un monsieur qui n'aurait jamais forgé un rivet ni un boulon, et qui aurait voulu faire joujou avec son marteau de cinq livres, se serait collé une fameuse courbature au bout de deux heures. Ça n'avait l'air de rien, mais ça vous nettoyait souvent des gaillards solides en quelques années. Cependant, les autres ouvriers tapaient aussi, tous à la fois. Leurs grandes ombres dansaient dans la clarté, les éclairs rouges du fer sortant du brasier traversaient les fonds noirs, des éclaboussements d'étincelles partaient sous les marteaux, rayonnaient comme des soleils, au ras des enclumes. Et Gervaise se sentait prise dans le branle de la forge, contente, ne s'en allant pas. Elle faisait un large détour, pour se rapprocher d'Etienne sans risquer d'avoir les mains brûlées, lorsqu'elle vit entrer l'ouvrier sale et barbu, auquel elle s'était adressée, dans la cour.","And as she asked him if the wrist wasn't going numb at the end of the day, he gave a good laugh. Did she believe him a lady? His wrist had seen gray ones for fifteen years; he had turned to iron, so much had he rubbed himself against the tools. Besides, she was right: a gentleman who would never have forged a rivet or a bolt, and who would have liked to play with his five-pound hammer, would have stuck to a famous stiffness after two hours. It didn't seem like much, but it often cleared you of strong fellows in a few years. However, the other workers were also typing, all at once. Their great shadows danced in the light, the red flashes of iron issuing from the brazier crossed the black depths, splashes of sparks shot out from under the hammers, shone like suns, level with the anvils. And Gervaise felt caught up in the rush of the forge, happy, not going away. She was making a wide detour, to get closer to Etienne without risking getting her hands burned, when she saw the dirty, bearded workman she had spoken to enter the yard.","he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","And when she asked him if his wrist did not feel stiff at the end of the day he laughed aloud. Did she think him a young lady? His wrist had had plenty of drudgery for fifteen years past; it was now as strong as the iron implements it had been so long in contact with. She was right though; a gentleman who had never forged a rivet or a bolt, and who would try to show off with his five pound hammer, would find himself precious stiff in the course of a couple of hours. It did not seem much, but a few years of it often did for some very strong fellows. During this conversation the other workmen were also hammering away all together. Their tall shadows danced about in the light, the red flashes of the iron that the fire traversed, the gloomy recesses, clouds of sparks darted out from beneath the hammers and shone like suns on a level with the anvils. And Gervaise, feeling happy and interested in the movement round the forge, did not think of leaving. She was going a long way round to get nearer to Etienne without having her hands burnt, when she saw the dirty and bearded workman, whom she had spoken to outside, enter. “"
"La blanchisseuse demeura toute gênée. Voilà ce qu'elle craignait. Maintenant, elle devinait qu'il allait être question de Lantier et d'Adèle. La mécanique ronflait, un redoublement de chaleur rayonnait du tuyau rouge. Dans cet assoupissement, les ouvrières, qui faisaient durer leur café pour se remettre à l'ouvrage le plus tard possible, regardaient la neige de la rue, avec des mines gourmandes et alanguies. Elles en étaient aux confidences ; elles disaient ce qu'elles auraient fait, si elles avaient eu dix mille francs de rente ; elles n'auraient rien fait du tout, elles seraient restées comme ça des après-midi à se chauffer, en crachant de loin sur la besogne. Virginie s'était rapprochée de Gervaise, de façon à ne pas être entendue des autres. Et Gervaise se sentait toute lâche, à cause sans doute de la trop grande chaleur, si molle et si lâche, qu'elle ne trouvait pas la force de détourner la conversation ; même elle attendait les paroles de la grande brune, le cœur gros d'une émotion dont elle jouissait sans se l'avouer.","The laundress remained embarrassed. That's what she feared. Now she guessed that it was going to be a question of Lantier and Adele. The mechanics hummed, an increase in heat radiated from the red pipe. In this drowsiness, the workers, who were making their coffee last to get back to work as late as possible, looked at the snow in the street, with greedy and languid faces. They were in confidences; they said what they would have done if they had had an income of ten thousand francs; they wouldn't have done anything at all, they would have stayed like that for afternoons warming up, spitting on the job from afar. Virginie had moved closer to Gervaise, so as not to be overheard by the others. And Gervaise felt completely cowardly, no doubt because of the excessive heat, so soft and so cowardly that she couldn't find the strength to turn the conversation around; she even waited for the words of the tall brunette, her heart heavy with an emotion which she enjoyed without admitting it to herself.","Gervaise colored; she could not answer. This was just what she had been dreading. In a moment she felt sure she would hear Lantier's name. She knew it was coming. Virginie drew nearer to her. The apprentices lingered over their coffee and told each other as they looked stupidly into the street what they would do if they had an income of ten thousand francs. Virginie changed her seat and took a footstool by the side of Gervaise, who felt weak and cowardly and helpless to change the conversation or to stave off what was coming. She breathlessly awaited the next words, her heart big with an emotion which she would not acknowledge to herself.","This was what Gervaise had been dreading. She guessed that the subject of Lantier and Adele would now come up. Virginie had moved close to Gervaise so as not to be overheard by the others. Gervaise, lulled by the excessive heat, felt so limp that she couldn’t even summon the willpower to change the subject. She foresaw what the tall brunette would say and her heart was stirred with an emotion which she didn’t want to admit to herself."
"- Mettez-vous là, je vous ai gardé votre place ? Oh ! je n'en ai pas pour longtemps. Boche ne salit presque pas son linge ? Et vous ? ça ne va pas traîner non plus, hein ? Il est tout petit, votre paquet. Avant midi, nous aurons expédié ça, et nous pourrons aller déjeuner ? Moi, je donnais mon linge à une blanchisseuse de la rue Poulet ; mais elle m'emportait tout, avec son chlore et ses brosses. Alors, je lave moi-même. C'est tout gagné. Ça ne coûte que le savon ? Dites donc, voilà des chemises que vous auriez dû mettre à couler. Ces gueux d'enfants, ma parole ! ça a de la suie au derrière.","- Put yourself there, I saved your place for you? Oh ! I don't have long. Boche hardly soils his laundry? And you? it won't drag either, huh? It is very small, your package. Before noon, we'll have this shipped, and we can go to lunch? I gave my laundry to a laundress in the rue Poulet; but she took everything away from me, with her chlorine and her brushes. So I wash myself. It's all won. It only costs the soap? Say, here are some shirts you should have worn. These childish beggars, my word! it has soot on the back.","""Yes, this is your place. I have kept it for you. I have not much to do. Boche is never hard on his linen, and you, too, do not seem to have much. Your package is quite small. We shall finish by noon, and then we can get something to eat. I used to give my clothes to a woman in La Rue Pelat, but bless my heart, she washed and pounded them all away, and I made up my mind to wash myself. It is clear gain, you see, and costs only the soap.""","“Put your things there, I’ve kept your place. Oh, I sha’n’t be long over what I’ve got. Boche scarcely dirties his things at all. And you, you won’t be long either, will you? Your bundle’s quite a little one. Before twelve o’clock we shall have finished, and we can go off to lunch. I used to send my things to a laundress in the Rue Poulet, but she destroyed everything with her chlorine and her brushes; so now I do the washing myself. It’s so much saved; it only costs the soap. I say, you should have put those shirts to soak. Those little rascals of children, on my word! One would think their bodies were covered with soot.”"
- Hein ? voilà une bonne affaire de faite ?,- Eh ? this is a good deal done?,"""We must take a glass of wine together—""","“Well! That’s a good thing finished, isn’t it?”"
Pour lui point de quartier !,No neighborhood for him!,"Mme Putois started up and began a fierce piratical song, standing stiff and erect in her black dress, her pale face surrounded by her black lace cap, and gesticulating violently.",Accord him no quarter.
"Un moment, elles restèrent là, agenouillées, à se menacer. Les cheveux dans la face, la poitrine soufflante, boueuses, tuméfiées, elles se guettaient, attendant, reprenant haleine. Gervaise porta le premier coup ; son battoir glissa sur l'épaule de Virginie. Et elle se jeta de côté pour éviter le battoir de celle-ci, qui l'effleura à la hanche. Alors, mises en train, elles se tapèrent comme les laveuses tapent leur linge, rudement, en cadence. Quand elles se touchaient, le coup s'amortissait, on aurait dit une claque dans un baquet d'eau.","For a moment they stood there, kneeling, threatening each other. The hair in the face, the chest blowing, muddy, swollen, they watched each other, waiting, catching their breath. Gervaise struck the first blow; his paddle slipped on Virginie's shoulder. And she threw herself aside to avoid the latter's kick, which brushed her hip. So, getting started, they hit each other like the washers hit their laundry, harshly, rhythmically. When they touched, the blow was deadened, like a slap in a bucket of water.","They knelt in front of each other in utter silence for at least a minute, with hair streaming, eyes glaring and distended nostrils. They each drew a long breath. Gervaise struck the first blow with her beater full on the shoulders of her adversary and then threw herself over on the side to escape Virginie's weapon, which touched her on the hip. Thus started, they struck each other as laundresses strike their linen, in measured cadence.","For a moment they remained there, on their knees, menacing each other. Their hair all over their faces, their breasts heaving, muddy, swelling with rage, they watched one another, as they waited and took breath. Gervaise gave the first blow. Her beetle glided off Virginie’s shoulder, and she at once threw herself on one side to avoid the latter’s beetle, which grazed her hip. Then, warming to their work they struck at each other like washerwomen beating clothes, roughly, and in time. Whenever there was a hit, the sound was deadened, so that one might have thought it a blow in a tub full of water."
- Voilà le balcon d'où Charles IX a tiré sur le peuple.,- This is the balcony from which Charles IX fired at the people.,"""That is the balcony where Charles IX fired on the people!""",“That’s the balcony from which Charles IX. fired on the people.”
"- Vous êtes heureuse, allez ! madame Coupeau, dit madame Bijard, que son soûlard de mari, un serrurier, tuait de coups chaque soir en rentrant. Si le mien était comme ça, quand il s'est piqué le nez, ce serait un plaisir !","- You're happy, come on! Madame Coupeau, said Madame Bijard, whom her drunkard husband, a locksmith, killed with blows every evening when he came home. If mine was like that when it pricked its nose, it would be a pleasure!","Gervaise already regretted her momentary vexation and assisted her husband to his feet and then turned her cheek to him with a smile, but he put his arm round her and kissed her neck.","“You’re lucky, you are, Madame Coupeau,” said Madame Bijard, whose drunkard of a husband, a locksmith, was nearly beating her to death each evening when he came in. “If my old man was like that when he’s had a drop, it would be a real pleasure!”"
"Et, lorsqu'elle revint s'asseoir, presque tout de suite, elle changer de conversation. Le forgeron l'avait sans doute suppliée de ne pas demander de l'argent à Gervaise. Mais, malgré elle, au bout de cinq minutes, elle parlait de nouveau de la dette. Oh ! elle avait prévu ce qui arrivait, le zingueur buvait la boutique, et il mènerait sa femme loin. Aussi jamais son fils n'aurait prêté les cinq cents francs, s'il l'avait écoutée. Aujourd'hui, il serait marié, il ne crèverait pas de tristesse, avec la perspective d'être malheureux toute sa vie. Elle s'animait, elle devenait très dure, accusant clairement Gervaise de s'être entendue avec Coupeau pour abuser de son bêta d'enfant. Oui, il y avait des femmes qui jouaient l'hypocrisie pendant des années et dont la mauvaise conduite finissait par éclater au grand jour.","And, when she came back to sit down, almost immediately, she changed the conversation. The blacksmith had doubtless begged her not to ask Gervaise for money. But despite herself, after five minutes, she was talking about the debt again. Oh ! she had foreseen what was happening, the zinc worker was drinking up the shop, and he would take his wife far away. So her son would never have lent the five hundred francs if he had listened to her. Today, he would be married, he would not die of sadness, with the prospect of being unhappy all his life. She became animated, she became very hard, clearly accusing Gervaise of having agreed with Coupeau to take advantage of her stupid child. Yes, there were women who played hypocrisy for years and whose misbehavior eventually came to light.","When she returned she changed the conversation. Her son had undoubtedly begged her to say no more about this money to Gervaise. In spite of her evident determination to avoid this subject, she returned to it again in about ten minutes. She knew from the beginning just what would happen. She had said so at the time, and all had turned out precisely as she had prophesied. The tinworker had drunk up the shop and had left his wife to bear the load by herself. If her son had taken her advice he would never have lent the money. His marriage had fallen through, and he had lost his spirits. She grew very angry as she spoke and finally accused Gervaise openly of having, with her husband, deliberately conspired to cheat her simplehearted son. ""Many women,"" she exclaimed, ""played the parts of hypocrites and prudes for years and were found out at the last!""","And when she returned to her seat, which was almost immediately, she changed the conversation. The blacksmith had doubtless begged her not to ask Gervaise for money; but in spite of herself she again spoke of the debt at the expiration of five minutes. Oh! She had foreseen long ago what was now happening. Coupeau was drinking all that the laundry business brought in and dragging his wife down with him. Her son would never have loaned the money if he had only listened to her. By now he would have been married, instead of miserably sad with only unhappiness to look forward to for the rest of his life. She grew quite stern and angry, even accusing Gervaise of having schemed with Coupeau to take advantage of her foolish son. Yes, some women were able to play the hypocrite for years, but eventually the truth came out."
"C'était un mannezingue de l'ancien jeu, une boutique noire, sous un plafond bas, avec une salle enfumée, à côté, dans laquelle on vendait de la soupe. Et il restait là jusqu'au soir, à jouer des canons au tourniquet ; il avait l'œil chez François, qui promettait formellement de ne jamais présenter la note à la bourgeoise. N'est-ce pas ? il fallait bien se rincer un peu la dalle, pour la débarrasser des crasses de la veille. Un verre de vin en pousse un autre. Lui, d'ailleurs, toujours bon zigue, ne donnant pas une chiquenaude au sexe, aimant la rigolade, bien sûr, et se piquant le nez à son tour, mais gentiment, plein de mépris pour ces saloperies d'hommes tombés dans l'alcool, qu'on ne voit pas dessoûler ! Il rentrait gai et galant comme un pinson.","It was a manningue of the old game, a dark shop, under a low ceiling, with a smoky room next to it, in which soup was sold. And he stayed there until evening, playing guns at the turnstile; he had his eye on Francois, who formally promised never to present the note to the bourgeoise. Is not it ? it was necessary to rinse the slab a little, to rid it of the grime of the day before. One glass of wine drives another. He, moreover, always good zigue, not giving a flick to sex, loving fun, of course, and pricking his nose in turn, but kindly, full of contempt for these filthy men fallen into the alcohol, which we do not see sober! He came home gay and gallant as a chaffinch.","One glass washed down another, but he came home as gay as a lark and quite disgusted with the men he had seen who were drinking themselves to death.","This was an old-fashioned place with a low ceiling. There was a smoky room to one side where soup was served. He would stay there until evening drinking because there was an understanding that he didn’t have to pay right away and they would never send the bill to his wife. Besides he was a jolly fellow, who would never do the least harm—a chap who loved a spree sure enough, and who colored his nose in his turn but in a nice manner, full of contempt for those pigs of men who have succumbed to alcohol, and whom one never sees sober! He always went home as gay and as gallant as a lark."
"Tout appesanti de sommeil, mal éveillé, il grogna d'abord :","All heavy with sleep, barely awake, he grunted at first:","""She is dead,"" she said.","Heavy with sleep, only half awake, he grunted at first:"
"- Sans doute, c'est ce que je pense, reprit le chapelier. J'ai seulement pris les chiffres pour votre gouverne ? Dites-moi ce que vous désirez ; après le déjeuner, j'irai commander.","""No doubt, that's what I think,"" resumed the hatter. I only took the numbers for your guidance? Tell me what you want; after lunch, I'll go order.","""Precisely!"" answered Lantier. ""I only tell you this as your guide. Decide what you want, and after breakfast I will go and attend to it all.""","“Of course, that’s just what I think,” resumed the hatter. “I merely asked the prices to guide you. Tell me what you desire; and after lunch I will give the orders.”"
"- En voilà assez, hein ? Je m'en fiche pas mal de la boutique ! Je n'en veux plus ? Comprenez-vous, je m'en fiche ! Tout est fini !","- That's enough, huh? I don't really care about the store! I do not want it anymore ? Do you understand, I don't care! All is finished !","""If you want the shop, take it!""","“That’s enough, isn’t it? I don’t care a straw for the shop! I want no more of it. Do you understand? It can go to the deuce! All is over!”"
"- Ah bien ! dit-elle, ce n'est pas commode d'arriver ici ? Je me croyais au bout du monde ?","- Ah well ! she said, isn't it convenient to get here? I thought I was at the end of the world?","he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","“Well!” she said, “it isn’t easy to find your way here. I thought I was going to the end of the world.”"
"Le zingueur secouait la main du camarade, pour le remercier de son bon renseignement ; et il s'en allait, quand Mes-Bottes se fâcha. Tonnerre de Dieu ! est-ce que le Bourguignon allait les empêcher de boire la goutte ? Les hommes n'étaient plus des hommes, alors ? Le singe pouvait bien attendre cinq minutes. Et Lantier entra pour accepter la tournée, les quatre ouvriers se tinrent debout devant le comptoir. Cependant, Mes-Bottes, avec ses souliers éculés, sa blouse noire d'ordures, sa casquette aplatie sur le sommet du crâne, gueulait fort et roulait des yeux de maître dans l'Assommoir. Il venait d'être proclamé empereur des pochards et roi des cochons, pour avoir mangé une salade de hannetons vivants et mordu dans un chat crevé.","The zinc worker shook his comrade's hand to thank him for his good information; and he was leaving when My-Boots got angry. Thunder of God! was the Burgundian going to prevent them from drinking gout? Men were no longer men, then? The monkey could wait five minutes. And Lantier came in to accept the tour, the four workmen stood in front of the counter. Meanwhile, My-Boots, with his worn-out shoes, his black garbage blouse, his cap flattened on the top of his head, was yelling loudly and rolling his master's eyes in the Assommoir. He had just been proclaimed emperor of the drunks and king of the pigs, for having eaten a salad of live cockchafers and biting into a dead cat.","Coupeau shook his comrade's hand and turned to depart, much to the disgust of Mes-Bottes, who angrily asked if the master could not wait five minutes. He could not go until he had taken a drink. Lantier entered to join in, and Mes-Bottes stood there with his hat on the back of his head, shabby, dirty and staggering, ordering Father Colombe to pour out the glasses and not to cheat.","Then Coupeau thanked his friend for the useful information and shook his hand. As he was about to leave, My-Boots cursed angrily. Was that lousy Bourguignon going to stop them from having a drink? Weren’t they free any more? He could well wait another five minutes. Lantier came in to share in the round and they stood together at the counter. My-Boots, with his smock black with dirt and his cap flattened on his head had recently been proclaimed king of pigs and drunks after he had eaten a salad of live beetles and chewed a piece of a dead cat."
"Maintenant, Nana ne fourrait plus des boules de papier dans son corsage. Des nichons lui étaient venus, une paire de nichons de satin blanc tout neufs. Et ça ne l'embarrassait guère, elle aurait voulu en avoir plein les bras, elle rêvait des tétais de nounou, tant la jeunesse est gourmande et inconsidérée. Ce qui la rendait surtout friande, c'était une vilaine habitude qu'elle avait prise de sortir un petit bout de sa langue entre ses quenottes blanches. Sans doute, en se regardant dans les glaces, elle s'était trouvée gentille ainsi. Alors, tout le long de la journée, pour faire la belle, elle tirait la langue.","Now Nana no longer stuffed balls of paper into her bodice. Boobs had come to her, a brand new pair of white satin boobs. And that hardly embarrassed her, she would have liked to have her hands full, she dreamed of nanny heads, so greedy and inconsiderate is youth. What made her particularly fond of her was a nasty habit she had taken of sticking out a little bit of her tongue between her white teeth. No doubt, looking at herself in the mirrors, she thought she was nice like that. So, all day long, to show off, she stuck out her tongue.","Her mass of blonde hair—the color of ripe wheat—looked around her temples as if it were powdered with gold. She had a quaint little trick of sticking out the tip of her tongue between her white teeth, and this habit, for some reason, exasperated her mother.","Nana no longer needed to stuff wads of paper into her bodice, her breasts were grown. She wished they were larger though, and dreamed of having breasts like a wet-nurse. What made her particularly tempting was a nasty habit she had of protruding the tip of her tongue between her white teeth. No doubt on seeing herself in the looking-glasses she had thought she was pretty like this; and so, all day long , she poked her tongue out of her mouth, in view of improving her appearance."
- Ah bien ! ça ne traîne pas. Ils vous envoient ça en quatre mouvements ? C'est comme chez les dentistes : on n'a pas le temps de crier ouf ! ils marient sans douleur.,- Ah well ! it doesn't drag. They send you that in four movements? It's like at the dentists: we don't have time to shout phew! they marry without pain.,"We had no time to cry out before it was all over!"" ""Yes,"" muttered Lorilleux, ""they take less than five minutes to do what can't be undone in all one's life!","“Well, it sure didn’t take long.

"L'dimanche, à la P'tite Villette,","On Sundays, at La P'tite Villette,","The guests within were all more or less tipsy, and there was so much noise that the policemen ran to quell a riot, but when they saw Poisson they bowed respectfully and passed on.","“On Sundays at Petite Villette,"
"- Écoutez, maman a tort, dit-il à la blanchisseuse d'une voix presque basse. Vous ne me devez rien, je ne veux pas qu'on parle de ça.","- Listen, mom is wrong, he said to the laundress in an almost low voice. You don't owe me anything, I don't want to talk about that.","Goujet, crushed by what he had heard from Mamma Coupeau, lay at full length on the bed with pale face and haggard eyes.","“Listen, mamma’s wrong,” said he to the laundress in a voice that was scarcely audible. “You owe me nothing. I won’t have it mentioned again.”"
"Et il recommença à pleurer comme un enfant. Il but tout de même le verre de vin, pour éteindre le feu qui lui brûlait la poitrine. Lantier fila bientôt, sous le prétexte d'aller prévenir la famille et de passer à la mairie faire la déclaration. Il avait besoin de prendre l'air. Aussi ne se pressa-t-il pas, fumant des cigarettes, goûtant le froid vif de la matinée. En sortant de chez madame Lerat, il entra même dans une crémerie dès Batignolles prendre une tasse de café bien chaud. Et il resta là une bonne heure, à réfléchir.","And he started crying like a child again. He drank the glass of wine all the same, to put out the fire burning in his chest. Lantier soon slipped away, under the pretext of going to warn the family and going to the town hall to make the declaration. He needed to get some fresh air. So he did not hurry, smoking cigarettes, tasting the sharp cold of the morning. On leaving Madame Lerat's, he even went into a creamery in Batignolles to have a hot cup of coffee. And he stayed there for a good hour, thinking.","said Lantier, pouring out a glass of wine as he spoke. Coupeau took some wine, but he continued to weep, and Lantier went off under pretext of informing the family, but he did not hurry. He walked along slowly, smoking a cigar, and after he had been to Mme Lerat's he stopped in at a crèmerie to take a cup of coffee, and there he sat for an hour or more in deep thought.","And he recommenced crying like a child. Then he drank the glass of wine, hoping to put out the flame searing his breast. Lantier soon left, using the excuse of informing the family and filing the necessary declaration at the town hall. Really though, he felt the need of fresh air, and so he took his time, smoking cigarettes and enjoying the morning air. When he left Madame Lerat’s house, he went into a dairy place on Les Batignolles for a cup of hot coffee and remained there an hour, thinking things over."
"- Vous voyez ça ? eh bien, c'est à papa, personne ne peut se flatter d'avoir quelque chose d'aussi chouette ? Ce qu'il y a là-dedans, vous ne vous l'imaginez pas. C'est-à-dire que, si on appliquait la moitié de ces idées, ça nettoierait du coup la société. Oui, votre empereur et tous ses roussins boiraient un bouillon ?","- Do you see that? well, it's up to dad, can't anyone flatter themselves that they have something so nice? What's in there, you can't imagine. That is to say, if we applied half of these ideas, it would clean up society. Yes, your emperor and all his roussins would drink broth?","He laid them all in a corner of the room, saying as he did so: ""If people would study those sheets and adopt the ideas therein, society would be far better organized than it now is. Your emperor and all his minions would come down a bit on the ladder—""","“You see that? No one else can boast of having anything to match it. You can’t imagine all that’s in there. I mean, if they put into practice only half the ideas, it would clean up the social order overnight. That would be good medicine for your Emperor and all his stool pigeons.”"
"- C'est vrai, confessa madame Goujet, vous prenez des défauts, mais vous n'avez pas encore celui-là.","- It's true, confessed Madame Goujet, you have faults, but you don't have that one yet.","""That is true,"" replied the elder woman. ""You have many faults, my dear, but not that one yet.""","“That’s true,” admitted Madame Goujet; “you’ve got into many bad habits but you’re still free of that one.”"
"- Tiens ! tu as raison, c'est une bonne idée. Comme ça, nous boirons la monnaie ensemble.","- Take ! you're right, that's a good idea. That way we'll drink the change together.","She answered slowly: ""You are right; it is a good idea. We can drink up the money together.""","And she slowly replied: “Why, you’re right, it’s a good idea. That way, we can drink up the coin together.”"
"Gervaise, la tête basse, reçut la leçon en bégayant. Les dix francs devaient compléter l'argent d'un billet qu'elle avait souscrit à son marchand de coke. Mais madame Goujet devint plus sévère au mot de billet. Elle s'offrit en exemple : elle réduisait sa dépense, depuis qu'on avait baissé les journées de Goujet de douze francs à neuf francs. Quand on manquait de sagesse en étant jeune, on crevait la faim dans sa vieillesse. Pourtant, elle se retint, elle ne dit pas à Gervaise qu'elle lui donnait son linge uniquement pour lui permettre de payer sa dette ; autrefois, elle lavait tout, et elle recommencerait à tout laver, si le blanchissage devait encore lui faire sortir de pareilles sommes de la poche. Quand Gervaise tint les dix francs sept sous, elle remercia, elle se sauva vite. Et, sur le palier, elle se sentit à l'aise, elle eut envie de danser, car elle s'accoutumait déjà aux ennuis et aux saletés de l'argent, ne gardant de ces embêtements-là que le bonheur d'en être sortie, jusqu'à la prochaine fois.","Gervaise, her head bowed, received the lesson with a stutter. The ten francs were to supplement the money for a note which she had subscribed to at her coke merchant. But Madame Goujet became more severe at the word billet. She offered herself as an example: she had reduced her expenses since Goujet's days had been reduced from twelve francs to nine francs. When you lacked wisdom when you were young, you starved in your old age. However, she restrained herself, she did not tell Gervaise that she was giving her her linen only to enable her to pay her debt; in the past, she washed everything, and she would start washing everything again, if the laundering were to bring such sums out of her pocket again. When Gervaise held up the ten francs seven sous, she thanked her and ran away quickly. And, on the landing, she felt at ease, she felt like dancing, for she was already getting used to the troubles and filthiness of money, keeping from these annoyances only the happiness of being there. out, until next time.","Gervaise, with downcast eyes, received the lesson meekly. She needed the ten francs to complete the amount due the coal merchant, she said. But her friend heard this with a stern countenance and told her she should reduce her expenses, but she did not add that she, too, intended to do the same and that in future she should do her washing herself, as she had formerly done, if she were to be out of pocket thus. When Gervaise was on the staircase her heart was light, for she cared little for the reproof now that she had the ten francs in her hand; she was becoming accustomed to paying one debt by contracting another.","Gervaise received the lecture with bowed head and stammering excuses. The ten francs were to make up the amount of a bill she had given her coke merchant. But on hearing the word “bill,” Madame Goujet became severer still. She gave herself as an example; she had reduced her expenditure ever since Goujet’s wages had been lowered from twelve to nine francs a day. When one was wanting in wisdom whilst young, one dies of hunger in one’s old age. But she held back and didn’t tell Gervaise that she gave her their laundry only in order to help her pay off the debt. Before that she had done all her own washing, and she would have to do it herself again if the laundry continued taking so much cash out of her pocket. Gervaise spoke her thanks and left quickly as soon as she had received the ten francs seven sous. Outside on the landing she was so relieved she wanted to dance. She was becoming used to the annoying, unpleasant difficulties caused by a shortage of money and preferred to remember not the embarrassment but the joy in escaping from them."
"Les ouvrières étaient parties depuis longtemps. Maman Coupeau et Nana venaient de se coucher. Alors, Gervaise, qui tenait déjà un volet quand ils avaient paru, laissa la boutique ouverte, apporta sur un coin de l'établi des verres et le fond d'une bouteille de cognac. Lantier restait debout, évitait de lui adresser directement la parole. Pourtant, quand elle le servit, il s'écria :","The workers were long gone. Maman Coupeau and Nana had just gone to bed. Then Gervaise, who was already holding a shutter when they appeared, left the shop open, brought glasses and the bottom of a bottle of cognac to a corner of the workbench. Lantier remained standing, avoided speaking to him directly. However, when she served him, he exclaimed:","Her workwomen had been gone some time. Nana and Mamma Coupeau were in bed, and Gervaise, who was just closing her shutters when her husband appeared, brought out some glasses and the remains of a bottle of brandy. Lantier did not sit down and avoided addressing her directly. When she served him, however, he exclaimed:","The workwomen had left long ago. Mother Coupeau and Nana had just gone to bed. Gervaise, who had been just about to put up the shutters when they appeared, left the shop open and brought some glasses which she placed on a corner of the work-table with what was left of a bottle of brandy. Lantier remained standing and avoided speaking directly to her. However, when she served him, he exclaimed:"
"- Aussi, reprit Gervaise, pourquoi sont-ils si rats ! ? vous savez, ils ont menti, le mois dernier, quand la femme a raconté partout qu'elle avait perdu un bout de chaîne d'or, en allant reporter l'ouvrage. Vrai ! si celle-là perd jamais quelque chose ! ? C'était simplement une façon de pleurer misère et de ne pas vous donner vos cent sous.","- Also, continued Gervaise, why are they so bad! ? you know, they lied, last month, when the woman said everywhere that she had lost a piece of gold chain, while going to put back the work. True ! if that one ever loses anything! ? It was simply a way of crying misery and not giving you your cents.","""How false they are!"" said Gervaise. ""Do you remember how she declared she had lost a piece of one of the chains when she was carrying them home? That was only to get out of giving you your five francs.""",“That’s because they’re so stingy themselves!” resumed Gervaise. “You know they lied last month when the woman went about everywhere saying that she had lost a piece of gold chain as she was taking the work home. The idea! There’s no fear of her ever losing anything! It was simply a way of making themselves out very poor and of not giving you your five francs.”
"Alors, elle resta collée contre le mur. Le médecin avait tourné le dos. Il s'accroupit, sans s'inquiéter s'il ne ramassait pas la poussière du paillasson avec sa redingote ; il étudia longtemps le tremblement de Coupeau, l'attendant au passage, le suivant du regard. Ce jour-là, les jambes sautaient à leur tour, le tremblement était descendu des mains dans les pieds ; un vrai polichinelle, dont on aurait tiré les fils, rigolant des membres, le tronc raide comme du bois. Le mal gagnait petit à petit. On aurait dit une musique sous la peau ; ça partait toutes les trois ou quatre secondes, roulait un instant ; puis ça s'arrêtait et ça reprenait, juste le petit frisson qui secoue les chiens perdus, quand ils ont froid l'hiver, sous une porte. Déjà le ventre et les épaules avaient un frémissement d'eau sur le point de bouillir.","So she stuck to the wall. The doctor had turned his back. He squatted, without worrying if he was not picking up the dust from the doormat with his frock coat; he studied Coupeau's trembling for a long time, waiting for him to pass, following him with his gaze. That day, the legs jumped in their turn, the trembling descended from the hands to the feet; a real puppet, from which one would have pulled the wires, laughing of the members, the stiff trunk like wood. Evil was gradually gaining ground. It was like music under the skin; it started every three or four seconds, rolled for a moment; then it would stop and start again, just the little shiver that shakes stray dogs when they are cold in winter, under a door. Already the belly and the shoulders had a quivering of water about to boil.","She leaned against the wall, utterly overcome. The physician turned away. He knelt on the mattress and carefully watched Coupeau; he wished to see if his feet trembled as much as his hands. His extremities vibrated as if on wires. The disease was creeping on, and the peculiar shivering seemed to be under the skin—it would cease for a minute or two and then begin again. The belly and the shoulders trembled like water just on the point of boiling.","Then she remained close to the wall. The doctor had turned his back to her. He squatted down, without troubling himself as to whether his overcoat trailed in the dust of the matting; for a long while he studied Coupeau’s trembling, waiting for its reappearance, following it with his glance. That day the legs were going in their turn, the trembling had descended from the hands to the feet; a regular puppet with his strings being pulled, throwing his limbs about, whilst the trunk of his body remained as stiff as a piece of wood. The disease progressed little by little. It was like a musical box beneath the skin; it started off every three or four seconds and rolled along for an instant; then it stopped and then it started off again, just the same as the little shiver which shakes stray dogs in winter, when cold and standing in some doorway for protection. Already the middle of the body and the shoulders quivered like water on the point of boiling."
"- Vous me connaissez, monsieur Goujet, je ne suis guère menteuse ? Eh bien ! non, ça n'est pas, ma parole d'honneur ! ? Jamais ça ne sera, entendez-vous ? jamais ! Le jour où ça arriverait, je deviendrais la dernière des dernières, je ne mériterais plus l'amitié d'un honnête homme comme vous.","- You know me, Mr. Goujet, I'm hardly a liar? Well ! no, it's not, my word of honor! ? It will never be, do you hear? never ! The day that would happen, I would become the last of the last, I would no longer deserve the friendship of an honest man like you.","""You know me well,"" she said; ""you know that I am no liar. I again repeat that Lantier and I are friends. We shall never be anything more, for if that should ever come to pass I should regard myself as the vilest of the vile and should be unworthy of the friendship of a man like yourself. "" Her face was so honest, her eyes were so clear and frank, that he could do no less than believe her.","“Monsieur Goujet, you know me well. You know that I do not lie. On my word of honor, it never happened, and it never will, do you understand? Never! I’d be the lowest of the low if it ever happened, and I wouldn’t deserve the friendship of an honest man like you.”"
"Et, brusquement, elle aperçut son ombre par terre. Quand elle approchait d'un bec de gaz, l'ombre vague se ramassait et se précisait, une ombre énorme, trapue, grotesque tant elle était ronde. Cela s'étalait, le ventre, la gorge, les hanches, coulant et flottant ensemble. Elle louchait si fort de la jambe, que, sur le sol, l'ombre faisait la culbute à chaque pas ; un vrai guignol ! Puis, lorsqu'elle s'éloignait, le guignol grandissait, devenait géant, emplissait le boulevard, avec des révérences qui lui cassaient le nez contre les arbres et contre les maisons. Mon Dieu ! qu'elle était drôle et effrayante ! Jamais elle n'avait si bien compris son avachissement. Alors, elle ne put s'empêcher de regarder ça, attendant les becs de gaz, suivant des yeux le chahut de son ombre. Ah ! elle avait là une belle gaupe qui marchait à côté d'elle ! Quelle touche ! Ça devait attirer les hommes tout de suite. Et elle baissait la voix, elle n'osait plus que bégayer dans le dos des passants.","And suddenly she saw her shadow on the ground. When she approached a gaslight, the vague shadow huddled together and took shape, an enormous shadow, stocky, grotesque it was so round. It was spreading out, belly, throat, hips, flowing and floating together. Her leg squinted so hard that the shadow on the ground tumbled with every step; a real jerk! Then, when she walked away, the puppet grew bigger, became gigantic, filled the boulevard, with bows that broke her nose against the trees and against the houses. My God ! she was funny and frightening! She had never understood his weakness so well. So she couldn't help looking at it, waiting for the gaslights, following with her eyes the ruckus of her shadow. Ah! she had a beautiful moose there walking by her side! What a touch! It had to attract men right away. And she lowered her voice, she only dared to stutter behind the backs of passers-by.","She saw her shadow on the ground as she stood near a street lamp. It was a grotesque shadow—grotesque because of her ample proportions. Her limp had become, with time and her additional weight, a very decided deformity, and as she moved the lengthening shadow of herself seemed to be creeping along the sides of the houses with bows and curtsies of mock reverence. Never before had she realized the change in herself. She was fascinated by this shadow. It was very droll, she thought, and she wondered if the men did not think so too.","But suddenly she perceived her shadow on the ground. When she approached a gas-lamp it gradually became less vague, till it stood out at last in full force—an enormous shadow it was, positively grotesque, so portly had she become. Her stomach, breast and hips, all equally flabby jostled together as it were. She walked with such a limp that the shadow bobbed almost topsy-turvy at every step she took; it looked like a real Punch! Then as she left the street lamp behind her, the Punch grew taller, becoming in fact gigantic, filling the whole Boulevard, bobbing to and fro in such style that it seemed fated to smash its nose against the trees or the houses. Mon Dieu! how frightful she was! She had never realised her disfigurement so thoroughly. And she could not help looking at her shadow; indeed, she waited for the gas-lamps, still watching the Punch as it bobbed about. Ah! she had a pretty companion beside her! What a figure!

"Et, comme en s'en allant il passait de nouveau devant le cabinet, il salua une dernière fois le corps d'une génuflexion dévote, à travers la porte grande ouverte.","And, as on leaving he again passed in front of the closet, he saluted the body one last time with a devout genuflexion, through the wide open door.",And as he passed the open door of the lighted room he saluted the corpse with another genuflection.,"And as on withdrawing he again passed before the little room, he saluted the corpse a last time through the wide open door by devoutly bending his knee."
"Dans la galerie d'Apollon, le parquet surtout émerveilla la société, un parquet luisant, clair comme un miroir, où les pieds des banquettes se reflétaient. Mademoiselle Remanjou fermait les yeux, parce qu'elle croyait marcher sur de l'eau. On criait à madame Gaudron de poser ses souliers à plat, à cause de sa position. M. Madinier voulait leur montrer les dorures et les peintures du plafond ; mais ça leur cassait le cou, et ils ne distinguaient rien. Alors, avant d'entrer dans le salon carré, il indiqua une fenêtre du geste, en disant :","In the Galerie d'Apollon, the parquet especially amazed society, a shiny parquet, clear as a mirror, where the legs of the benches were reflected. Mademoiselle Remanjou closed her eyes because she thought she was walking on water. They yelled at Madame Gaudron to lay her shoes flat, because of her position. M. Madinier wanted to show them the gilding and painting of the ceiling; but it broke their necks, and they couldn't make out anything. Then, before entering the square drawing-room, he indicated a window with a gesture, saying:","In the Gallerie d'Apollon the floor excited their admiration; it was smooth as glass; even the feet of the sofas were reflected in it. Madinier bade them look at the ceiling and at its many beauties of decoration, but they said they dared not look up. Then before entering the Salon Carré he pointed to the window and said:","In the Apollo Gallery, the inlaid flooring especially astonished the party—a shining floor, as clear as a mirror, and which reflected the legs of the seats. Mademoiselle Remanjou kept her eyes closed, because she could not help thinking that she was walking on water. They called to Madame Gaudron to be careful how she trod on account of her condition. Monsieur Madinier wanted to show them the gilding and paintings of the ceiling; but it nearly broke their necks to look up above, and they could distinguish nothing. Then, before entering the Square Salon, he pointed to a window, saying:"
"On applaudit, on cria bravo : c'était envoyé. Il faisait nuit noire, trois becs de gaz flambaient dans la salle, remuant de grandes clartés troubles, au milieu de la fumée des pipes. Les garçons, après avoir servi le café et le cognac, venaient d'emporter les dernières piles d'assiettes sales. En bas, sous les trois acacias, le bastringue commençait, un cornet à pistons et deux violons jouant très fort, avec des rires de femme, un peu rauques dans la nuit chaude.","We applauded, we shouted bravo: it was sent. It was pitch black, three gaslights were blazing in the room, stirring great troubled lights, amid the smoke from the pipes. The waiters, after having served the coffee and the cognac, had just taken away the last piles of dirty plates. Below, under the three acacias, the bastringue was beginning, a cornet and two violins playing very loudly, with female laughter, a little hoarse in the hot night.","""Let us have a punch,"" cried Mes-Bottes. But Coupeau, seeing his wife's troubled face, interfered and said no one should drink anything more.","The others applauded, shouting “Bravo!”—it was well answered. It was now pitch dark outside, three gas-jets were flaring in the room, diffusing dim rays in the midst of the tobacco-smoke. The waiters, after serving the coffee and the brandy, had removed the last piles of dirty plates. Down below, beneath the three acacias, dancing had commenced, a cornet-a-piston and two fiddles playing very loud, and mingling in the warm night air with the rather hoarse laughter of women."
"- Oui, oui, de la belle ouvrage, murmura Lorilleux en ricanant. Ça se bâcle en cinq minutes et ça tient bon toute la vie ? Ah ! ce pauvre Cadet-Cassis, va !","""Yes, yes, beautiful work,"" murmured Lorilleux with a sneer. It's botched in five minutes and it lasts a lifetime? Ah! that poor Cadet-Cassis, go!","""Yes,"" muttered Lorilleux, ""they take less than five minutes to do what can't be undone in all one's life! Poor Cadet-Cassis!""","“Yes, it’s a quick job,” Lorilleux smirked. “In five minutes you’re tied together for the rest of your life. You poor Young Cassis, you’ve had it.”"
"- Eh bien ! père Bru, lui demandait parfois la blanchisseuse, à quoi pensez-vous ?","- Well ! father Bru, the laundress sometimes asked him, what are you thinking?","""What are you thinking about?"" Gervaise would say gaily.","“Well, Pere Bru,” Gervaise would say, “what are you thinking of now?” “Nothing much."
"Gervaise bégaya, se défendit, posa la main sur son cœur pour donner sa parole sacrée.","Gervaise stammered, defended herself, put her hand on her heart to give her sacred word.",Gervaise attempted to defend herself and deny the accusation.,"Gervaise stammered, protested, and placed her hand upon her heart, as though to take her solemn oath."
"Cependant, l'ondée avait brusquement cessé. Le jour baissait encore, il faisait presque nuit, une nuit livide traversée par de larges éclairs. Bibi-la-Grillade répétait en riant qu'il allait tomber des curés, bien sûr. Alors, l'orage éclata avec une extrême violence. Pendant une demi-heure, l'eau tomba à seaux, la foudre gronda sans relâche. Les hommes, debout devant la porte, contemplaient le voile gris de l'averse, les ruisseaux grossis, la poussière d'eau volante montant du clapotement des flaques. Les femmes s'étaient assises, effrayées, les mains aux yeux. On ne causait plus, la gorge un peu serrée. Une plaisanterie faite sur le tonnerre par Boche, disant que saint Pierre éternuait là-haut, ne fit sourire personne. Mais, quand la foudre espaça ses coups, se perdit au loin, la société recommença à s'impatienter, se fâcha contre l'orage, jurant et montrant le poing aux nuées. Maintenant, du ciel couleur de cendre, une pluie fine tombait, interminable.","However, the shower had suddenly ceased. The day was falling again, it was almost night, a livid night shot through by large lightning bolts. Bibi-la-Grillade kept repeating, laughing, that he was going to get priests, of course. Then the storm broke with extreme violence. For half an hour, the water fell in buckets, the lightning rumbled relentlessly. The men, standing in front of the door, contemplated the gray veil of the downpour, the swollen streams, the dust of flying water rising from the lapping of the puddles. The women had sat down, frightened, their hands to their eyes. We didn't talk anymore, our throats a little constricted. A joke made on thunder by Boche, saying that Saint Peter was sneezing up there, did not make anyone smile. But when the lightning spaced out its blows, was lost in the distance, society began to grow impatient again, grew angry with the storm, swearing and shaking its fist at the clouds. Now, from the ash-colored sky, a fine rain fell, endless.","Meanwhile the shower ceased abruptly, but the storm was evidently not over, for sharp flashes of lightning darted through the black clouds. Suddenly the rain poured down again. The men stood in front of the door with their hands in their pockets, dismally contemplating the scene. The women crouched together with their hands over their eyes. They were in such terror they could not talk; when the thunder was heard farther off they all plucked up their spirits and became impatient, but a fine rain was falling that looked interminable.","The shower had abruptly ceased. The darkness increased, it was almost like night—a livid night rent at times by large flashes of lightning. Bibi-the-Smoker said laughingly that it would certainly rain priests. Then the storm burst forth with extreme violence. For half an hour the rain came down in bucketsful, and the thunder rumbled unceasingly. The men standing up before the door contemplated the grey veil of the downpour, the swollen gutters, the splashes of water caused by the rain beating into the puddles. The women, feeling frightened, had sat down again, holding their hands before their eyes. They no longer conversed, they were too upset. A jest Boche made about the thunder, saying that St. Peter was sneezing up there, failed to raise a smile. But, when the thunder-claps became less frequent and gradually died away in the distance, the wedding guests began to get impatient, enraged against the storm, cursing and shaking their fists at the clouds. A fine and interminable rain now poured down from the sky which had become an ashy grey."
"Mais madame Goujet se récria. Cette chemise n'était pas à elle, elle n'en voulait pas. On lui changeait son linge, c'était le comble ! Déjà, l'autre semaine, elle avait eu deux mouchoirs qui ne portaient pas sa marque. Ça ne la ragoûtait guère, du linge venu elle ne savait d'où. Puis, enfin, elle tenait à ses affaires.","But Madame Goujet protested. This shirt wasn't hers, she didn't want it. We were changing his linen, it was the height! Already, the other week, she had had two handkerchiefs which did not bear her mark. It didn't appeal to her much, laundry that had come from she didn't know where. Then, finally, she took care of her business.","But Mme Goujet cried out in indignation. That skirt did not belong to her, and she would not have it. This was the crowning touch, if her things were to be changed in this way. She did not like other people's things.","But Madame Goujet cried out. That chemise was not hers, she would have nothing to do with it. Her things were changed now; it was too bad! Only the week before, there were two handkerchiefs which hadn’t her mark on them. It was not to her taste to have clothes coming from no one knew where. Besides that, she liked to have her own things."
- Peut-on vous donner un coup de main ? cria Virginie.,- Can we give you a hand? Virginia shouted.,"Gervaise left the table to reappear presently, bearing the goose in triumph.",“Can I help you?” cried Virginie.
"Mais, en face du visage hébété de la blanchisseuse, elle recula et trembla. Elle connaissait ce souffle d'eau-de-vie, ces yeux pâles, cette bouche convulsée. Alors, Gervaise passa en trébuchant, sans dire un mot, pendant que la petite, debout sur le seuil de sa porte, la suivait de son regard noir, muet et grave.","But, facing the dazed face of the laundress, she recoiled and trembled. She knew that breath of brandy, those pale eyes, that convulsed mouth. Then Gervaise stumbled past, without saying a word, while the little one, standing on the threshold of her door, followed her with her dark, dumb, grave gaze.","But when she looked up in the face of the clearstarcher she recoiled, trembling from head to foot. She knew only too well that alcoholic smell, those wandering eyes and convulsed lips. Then as Gervaise staggered past her without speaking the child's arms fell at her side, and she looked after her friend with sad and solemn eyes.","But on beholding the laundress’ besotted face, she tremblingly drew back. She was acquainted with that brandy-laden breath, those pale eyes, that convulsed mouth. Then Gervaise stumbled past without uttering a word, whilst the child, standing on the threshold of her room, followed her with her dark eyes, grave and speechless."
"Et il reprit son travail menu, la face de nouveau dans le reflet verdâtre d'une boule d'eau, à travers laquelle la lampe envoyait sur son ouvrage un rond de vive lumière.","And he resumed his minute work, his face again in the greenish reflection of a ball of water, through which the lamp sent a circle of bright light onto his work.","And he returned to his work; his face was reflected in a ball filled with water, through which the lamp sent on his work a circle of the brightest possible light.","And he resumed his minute task, his face again in the reflection of a glass globe full of green-colored water, through which the lamp shed a circle of bright light over his work."
"- Une jolie conduite, murmura madame Putois. Vous vous crevez, ma petite.","""Pretty conduct,"" murmured Madame Putois. You are dying, my little one.",Virginie suddenly stooped down to her hostess and said with a smile:,"“Pretty conduct that,” murmured Madame Putois. “You’re killing yourself, my girl.”"
"Ce fut là le point de départ d'une grande amitié. Huit jours plus tard, Virginie ne passait plus devant la boutique de Gervaise sans entrer ; et elle y taillait des bavettes de deux et trois heures, si bien que Poisson, inquiet, la croyant écrasée, venait la chercher, avec sa figure muette de déterré. Gervaise, à voir ainsi journellement la couturière, éprouva bientôt une singulière préoccupation ; elle ne pouvait lui entendre commencer une phrase, sans croire qu'elle allait causer de Lantier ; elle songeait invinciblement à Lantier, tout le temps qu'elle restait là. C'était bête comme tout, car enfin elle se moquait de Lantier, et d'Adèle, et de ce qu'ils étaient devenus l'un et l'autre ; jamais elle ne posait une question ; même elle ne se sentait pas curieuse d'avoir de leurs nouvelles. Non, ça la prenait en dehors de sa volonté. Elle avait leur idée dans la tête comme on a dans la bouche un refrain embêtant, qui ne veut pas vous lâcher. D'ailleurs, elle n'en gardait nulle rancune à Virginie, dont ce n'était point la faute, bien sûr. Elle se plaisait beaucoup avec elle, et la retenait dix fois avant de la laisser partir.","This was the starting point of a great friendship. Eight days later, Virginie no longer passed in front of Gervaise's shop without entering; and she cut two and three o'clock bibs there, so that Poisson, worried, believing her crushed, came to look for her, with his mute face of unearthed. Gervaise, on seeing the seamstress thus daily, soon felt a singular preoccupation; she could not hear him begin a sentence without believing that she was going to talk about Lantier; she thought invincibly of Lantier all the time she remained there. It was silly as hell, for after all she was making fun of Lantier, and Adele, and what had become of them; she never asked a question; even she didn't feel curious to hear from them. No, it took her out of her control. She had their idea in her head like a pesky refrain in your mouth that won't let you go. Besides, she bore no grudge against Virginie, whose fault it was, of course. She liked her very much, and held her back ten times before letting her go.","This was the beginning of a great friendship. In another week Virginie could not pass the shop without going in, and sometimes she remained for two or three hours. At first Gervaise was very uncomfortable; she thought every time Virginie opened her lips that she would hear Lantier's name. Lantier was in her mind all the time she was with Mme Poisson. It was a stupid thing to do, after all, for what on earth did she care what had become of Lantier or of Adèle? But she was, nonetheless, curious to know something about them.","That was the starting point of a great friendship. A week later, Virginie never passed Gervaise’s shop without going in; and she remained there gossiping for hours together, to such an extent indeed that Poisson, filled with anxiety, fearing she had been run over, would come and seek her with his expressionless and death-like countenance. Now that she was seeing the dressmaker every day Gervaise became aware of a strange obsession. Every time Virginie began to talk Gervaise had the feeling Lantier was going to be mentioned. So she had Lantier on her mind throughout all of Virginie’s visits. This was silly because, in fact, she didn’t care a bit about Lantier or Adele at this time. She was quite certain that she had no curiosity as to what had happened to either of them. But this obsession got hold of her in spite of herself. Anyway, she didn’t hold it against Virginie, it wasn’t her fault, surely. She enjoyed being with her and looked forward to her visits."
"- Vous êtes bête ! vous ne songez qu'à la saleté ! disait Gervaise à Coupeau. Sans doute que je l'aimais ? Seulement, après la façon dégoûtante dont il m'a lâchée ?",- You are stupid ! you only think of dirt! said Gervaise to Coupeau. No doubt that I loved him? Only after the disgusting way he dumped me?,"Presently three more workmen entered together, and finally a crowd of blouses passed in between the dusty oleanders. ""You have no business to ask such questions,"" said Gervaise to Coupeau; ""of course I loved him. But after the manner in which he deserted me—""","“You’re foolish! You only think of the present,” Gervaise was saying to Coupeau. “Sure, I loved him, but after the disgusting way in which he left me—”"
- Je vous dis que c'est ma fille ! cria-t-il. Laissez-moi passer !,- I tell you it's my daughter! he shouted. Let me pass !,"At this moment Coupeau fell on his daughter. ""Don't try and keep me back,"" he said, ""for have her I will!""","“I tell you, it’s my daughter!” he cried; “let me pass.”"
"- Écoutez, Badingue ! cria Lantier, qui s'était remis à lui donner ce surnom, par amitié ; je retiens votre boîte, un cadeau pour une demoiselle.","- Listen, Badingue! cried Lantier, who had resumed giving him that nickname, out of friendship; I keep your box, a gift for a young lady.","""By the way,"" said Lantier, addressing himself to Gervaise, ""I saw Nana last night.""","“Say, Badingue!” cried Lantier, who had given him this surname again, out of friendship. “I shall want that box of yours as a present for a young lady.”"
"- Vous êtes dans votre lit, vous profitez de ça ? Écoutez, vous avez tort, vous voyez bien que je suis gentille, car jamais je ne vous ai jeté à la figure votre vie, à vous ! Oh ! je sais, une jolie vie, des deux ou trois hommes, du vivant du père Coupeau ? Non, ne toussez pas, j'ai fini de causer. C'est seulement pour vous demander de me ficher la paix, voilà tout !","- You're in your bed, you're enjoying it? Listen, you're wrong, you can see that I'm nice, because I've never thrown your life in your face, yours! Oh ! I know, a good life, two or three men, during Father Coupeau's lifetime? No, don't cough, I've finished talking. It's only to ask you to leave me alone, that's all!","""Now look here, you are flat on your back and you take advantage of that fact. I have never said a word to you about your own life, but I know it all the same—and it was atrocious! That is all! I am not going into particulars, but remember, you had best not sit in judgment on me!""","“You’re confined to your bed and you take advantage of it. Listen! You’re wrong. You see that I behave nicely to you, for I’ve never thrown your past life into your teeth. Oh! I know all about it. No, don’t cough. I’ve finished what I had to say. It’s only to request you to mind your own business, that’s all!”"
"- Elle se vide, répéta-t-elle, en allumant une autre chandelle.","""It's emptying,"" she repeated, lighting another candle.","They drank coffee and went by turns to look at the body, lying silent and calm under the flickering light of the candle.","“She’s emptying,” repeated she, lighting another candle."
"- Dame ! le bruit a couru dans le quartier, répondit Virginie. Vous comprenez, je n'y étais pas ? C'est dans le métier, d'ailleurs. Toutes en décrochent.","- Lady ! the rumor went round the neighborhood, replied Virginie. You understand, I was not there? It's in the business, by the way. All drop out.",Virginie suddenly stooped down to her hostess and said with a smile:,"“Oh, yes! The rumor was all round the neighborhood,” Virginie answered. “I didn’t see it myself, you understand, but it’s part of the job. All midwives do it.”"
"Nana grandissait, devenait garce. A quinze ans, elle avait poussé comme un veau, très blanche de chair, très grasse, si dodue même qu'on aurait dit une pelote. Oui, c'était ça, quinze ans, toutes ses dents et pas de corset. Une vraie frimousse de margot, trempée dans du lait, une peau veloutée de pêche, un nez drôle, un bec rose, des quinquets luisants auxquels les hommes avaient envie d'allumer leur pipe. Son tas de cheveux blonds, couleur d'avoine fraîche, semblait lui avoir jeté de la poudre d'or sur les tempes, des taches de rousseur, qui lui mettaient là une couronne de soleil. Ah ! une jolie pépée, comme disaient les Lorilleux, une morveuse qu'on aurait encore dû moucher et dont les grosses épaules avaient les rondeurs pleines, l'odeur mûre d'une femme faite.","Nana was growing up, becoming a bitch. At fifteen, she had grown like a calf, very white flesh, very fat, so plump even that it looked like a ball. Yes, that was it, fifteen, all her teeth and no corset. A real Margot's little face, soaked in milk, velvety peach skin, a funny nose, a pink beak, shiny candlesticks that men wanted to light their pipes. Her heap of blond hair, the color of fresh oats, seemed to have sprinkled gold dust on her temples, freckles, which gave her a crown of sunshine. Ah! a pretty granddaughter, as the Lorilleuxs said, a brat who should still have had her nose blown and whose big shoulders had the full roundness, the mature smell of a mature woman.","LITTLE NANA Nana was growing fast—fair, fresh and dimpled— her skin velvety, like a peach, and eyes so bright that men often asked her if they might not light their pipes at them. Her mass of blonde hair—the color of ripe wheat—looked around her temples as if it were powdered with gold.","Nana was growing up and becoming wayward. At fifteen years old she had expanded like a calf, white-skinned and very fat; so plump, indeed, you might have called her a pincushion. Yes, such she was—fifteen years old, full of figure and no stays. A saucy magpie face, dipped in milk, a skin as soft as a peach skin, a funny nose, pink lips and eyes sparkling like tapers, which men would have liked to light their pipes at. Her pile of fair hair, the color of fresh oats, seemed to have scattered gold dust over her temples, freckle-like as it were, giving her brow a sunny crown. Ah! a pretty doll, as the Lorilleuxs say, a dirty nose that needed wiping, with fat shoulders, which were as fully rounded and as powerful as those of a full-grown woman."
"- Allons, file ! reprit Gervaise ; marche devant ! et ne t'avise pas de te sauver, ou je te fais coucher en prison !","- Come on, go! resumed Gervaise; walk ahead! and don't you dare run away, or I'll put you in jail!","They ordered the Coupeau party to leave the room. ""Go,"" said Gervaise, ""and do not attempt to leave us, for so sure as you do you will be given in charge of a policeman.""","“Come, make haste!” resumed Gervaise. “Just walk in front, and don’t try to run off. You shall sleep in prison if you do.”"
"- Monsieur, écoutez donc ?","- Sir, are you listening?","""Sir,"" she said again, ""please listen.""","“Sir, just listen.”"
"Les invités piétinaient autour de la table. Tous avaient faim, bâillaient légèrement, l'air embêté.","The guests were stomping around the table. They were all hungry, yawning slightly, looking annoyed.","""We are all ready,"" cried Gervaise, reappearing and pulling down her sleeves over her white arms. ""Where can Coupeau be?""","cried Gervaise as she reappeared with a smile, her arms bare and her little fair curls blowing over her temples. “If the boss would only come,” resumed the laundress, “we might begin.”"
"- Elle chauffe, tu nous embêtes.","- It's getting hot, you're bothering us.","Gervaise answered impatiently, but Nana, who thought it better taste just then—all things considered—to receive with meekness all her father's abuse, dropped her eyes and did not reply.","“It’s warming up, don’t bother us.”"
"- Hein ? ma vieille, ils t'ont cassé la tête ? Tu comprends, je n'ai pas pu les empêcher de venir. Après tout, ça prouve leur amitié ? Mais, n'est-ce pas ? on est mieux seul. Moi, j'avais besoin d'être un peu seul, comme ça, avec toi. La soirée m'a paru d'un long ! ? Cette pauvre poule ! elle a eu bien du bobo ! Ces crapoussins-là, quand ça vient au monde, ça ne se doute guère du mal que ça fait. Vrai, ça doit être comme si on vous ouvrait les reins ? Où est-il le bobo, que je l'embrasse ?","- Eh ? my old, they broke your head? You see, I couldn't stop them from coming. After all, does that prove their friendship? But, isn't it? we are better off alone. Me, I needed to be a little alone, like that, with you. The evening seemed like a long one! ? That poor hen! she had a lot of trouble! These scumbags, when it comes into the world, they hardly suspect the harm it does. True, it must be like having your loins cut open? Where is the bobo, that I kiss him?","""I could not help their coming,"" he said, ""but I am sure they have given you the headache."" And the rough, clumsy man kissed his wife tenderly, moved by a great pity for all she had borne for his sake.","“Well, old woman, they’ve made your head ache, haven’t they? You see I couldn’t prevent them coming. After all, it shows their friendship. But we’re better alone, aren’t we? I wanted to be alone like this with you. It has seemed such a long evening to me! Poor little thing, she’s had a lot to go through! Those shrimps, when they come out into the world, have no idea of the pain they cause. It must really almost be like being split in two. Where does it hurt the most, that I may kiss it and make it well?”"
- Trois heures.,- Three hours.,"""Well, what of it?""",“Three o’clock.”
"- Quel poseur ! murmura en ricanant Bec-Salé, dit Boit-sans-Soif.","- What a poser! murmured, sneering Bec-Sale, said Drink-without-Thirst.","he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","“What a show-off!” jeeringly murmured Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst."
"A ce moment, Goujet toussa dans sa chambre. Gervaise eut un léger tressaillement. Comme on la traitait devant lui, mon Dieu ! Et elle resta au milieu de la chambre, gênée, confuse, attendant le linge sale. Mais, après avoir arrêté le compte, madame Goujet avait tranquillement repris sa place près de la fenêtre, travaillant au raccommodage d'un châle de dentelle.","At this moment Goujet coughed in his room. Gervaise gave a slight start. How they treated her in front of him, my God! And she remained in the middle of the room, embarrassed, confused, waiting for the dirty laundry. But, after having settled the account, Madame Goujet had quietly resumed her place near the window, working on mending a lace shawl.","At this moment Goujet coughed. Gervaise started. How could she bear being treated in this way before him? And she stood confused and silent, waiting for the soiled clothes. Mme Goujet had taken her place and her work by the window.","At this moment Goujet coughed in his room. Gervaise slightly started. Mon Dieu! How she was treated before him. And she remained standing in the middle of the rooms, embarrassed and confused and waiting for the dirty clothes; but after making up the account Madame Goujet had quietly returned to her seat near the window, and resumed the mending of a lace shawl."
"M. Marescot tendait de nouveau la main au zingueur, lorsque celui-ci parla des réparations, en lui rappelant sa promesse verbale de causer de cela plus tard. Mais le propriétaire se fâcha ; il ne s'était engagé à rien ; jamais, d'ailleurs, on ne faisait des réparations dans une boutique. Pourtant, il consentit à aller voir les lieux, suivi des Coupeau et de Boche. Le petit mercier était parti en emportant son agencement de casiers et de comptoirs ; la boutique, toute nue, montrait son plafond noir, ses murs crevés, où des lambeaux d'un ancien papier jaune pendaient. Là, dans le vide sonore des pièces, une discussion furieuse s'engagea. M. Marescot criait que c'était aux commerçants à embellir leurs magasins, car enfin un commerçant pouvait vouloir de l'or partout, et lui, propriétaire, ne pouvait pas mettre de l'or ; puis, il raconta sa propre installation, rue de la Paix, où il avait dépensé plus de vingt mille francs. Gervaise, avec son entêtement de femme, répétait un raisonnement qui lui semblait irréfutable : dans un logement, n'est-ce pas, il ferait coller du papier ? alors, pourquoi ne considérait-il pas la boutique comme un logement ? Elle ne lui demandait pas autre chose, blanchir le plafond et remettre du papier.","M. Marescot again held out his hand to the zinc worker when the latter spoke of the repairs, reminding him of his verbal promise to talk about it later. But the owner got angry; he had committed himself to nothing; never, moreover, were repairs made in a shop. However, he consented to go and see the place, followed by the Coupeaus and Boche. The little haberdasher had left, carrying his arrangement of lockers and counters; the bare shop showed its black ceiling, its broken walls, on which shreds of old yellow paper hung. There, in the sound vacuum of the rooms, a furious discussion took place. M. Marescot shouted that it was up to merchants to embellish their stores, for after all a merchant could want gold everywhere, and he, the proprietor, could not put in gold; then he told of his own establishment in the rue de la Paix, where he had spent more than twenty thousand francs. Gervaise, with her woman's stubbornness, repeated an argument which seemed to her irrefutable: in a flat, wouldn't he, he would have paper sticked up? so why didn't he consider the shop as a place of residence? She didn't ask him for anything else, whitewash the ceiling and put some paper back on.","She wondered if she would ever be turned out and then wondered again at the attitude assumed by these Boche people, who did not seem to have ever seen her before. They had eyes and ears only for the landlord, who shook hands with his new tenants but, when they spoke of repairs, professed to be in such haste that morning that it would be necessary to postpone the discussion. They reminded him of certain verbal promises he had made, and finally he consented to examine the premises. The shop stood with its four bare walls and blackened ceiling. The tenant who had been there had taken away his own counters and cases. A furious discussion took place. M. Marescot said it was for them to embellish the shop. ""That may be,"" said Gervaise gently, ""but surely you cannot call putting on a fresh paper, instead of this that hangs in strips, an embellishment.","Monsieur Marescot again held out his hand to the zinc-worker, when the latter spoke of the repairs, recalling to his mind a promise he had made to talk the matter over later on. But the landlord grew angry, he had never promised anything; besides, it was not usual to do any repairs to a shop. However, he consented to go over the place, followed by the Coupeaus and Boche. The little linen-draper had carried off all his shelves and counters; the empty shop displayed its blackened ceiling and its cracked wall, on which hung strips of an old yellow paper. In the sonorous emptiness of the place, there ensued a heated discussion. Monsieur Marescot exclaimed that it was the business of shopkeepers to embellish their shops, for a shopkeeper might wish to have gold put about everywhere, and he, the landlord, could not put out gold. Then he related that he had spent more than twenty thousand francs in fitting up his premises in the Rue de la Paix. Gervaise, with her woman’s obstinacy, kept repeating an argument which she considered unanswerable. He would repaper a lodging, would he not? Then, why did he not treat the shop the same as a lodging? She did not ask him for anything else—only to whitewash the ceiling, and put some fresh paper on the walls."
"Lantier et Gervaise passèrent une très agréable soirée au café-concert. A onze heures, lorsqu'on ferma les portes, ils revinrent en se baladant, sans se presser. Le froid piquait un peu, le monde se retirait par bandes ; et il y avait des filles qui crevaient de rire, sous les arbres, dans l'ombre, parce que les hommes rigolaient de trop près. Lantier chantait entre ses dents une des chansons de mademoiselle Amanda : C'est dans l'nez qu'ça me chatouille. Gervaise, étourdie, comme grise, reprenait le refrain. Elle avait eu très chaud. Puis, les deux consommations qu'elle avait bues lui tournaient sur le cœur, avec la fumée des pipes et l'odeur de toute cette société entassée. Mais elle emportait surtout une vive impression de mademoiselle Amanda. Jamais elle n'aurait osé se mettre nue comme ça devant le public. Il fallait être juste, cette dame avait une peau à faire envie. Et elle écoutait, avec une curiosité sensuelle, Lantier donner des détails sur la personne en question, de l'air d'un monsieur qui lui aurait compté les côtes en particulier.","Lantier and Gervaise spent a very pleasant evening at the café-concert. At eleven o'clock, when the doors were closed, they came back strolling, without hurrying. The cold was biting a little, people were withdrawing in bands; and there were girls bursting with laughter, under the trees, in the shade, because the men were laughing too closely. Lantier was singing between his teeth one of Mademoiselle Amanda's songs: It's in the nose that it tickles me. Gervaise, stunned, as if drunk, took up the refrain. She had been very hot. Then, the two drinks she had drunk turned on her heart, with the smoke from the pipes and the smell of all this crowded society. But above all she carried away a vivid impression of Miss Amanda. She would never have dared to get naked like that in front of the public. You had to be fair, this lady had skin to envy. And she listened, with sensual curiosity, to Lantier giving details of the person in question, with the air of a gentleman who had counted his ribs in private.","Lantier and Gervaise passed a very agreeable evening at the cafe concert, and when the doors were closed at eleven they went home in a sauntering sort of fashion. They were in no hurry, and the night was fair, though a little cool. Lantier hummed the air which Amanda had sung, and Gervaise added the chorus. The room had been excessively warm, and she had drunk several glasses of wine. She expressed a great deal of indignation at Mlle Amanda's costume. How did she dare face all those men, dressed like that? But her skin was beautiful, certainly, and she listened with considerable curiosity to all that Lantier could tell her about the woman.","Lantier and Gervaise spent a very pleasant evening at the music-hall. At eleven o’clock when the place closed, they strolled home without hurrying themselves. The cold was quite sharp. People seemed to be in groups. Some of the girls were giggling in the darkness as their men pressed close to them. Lantier was humming one of Mademoiselle Amanda’s songs. Gervaise, with her head spinning from too much drink, hummed the refrain with him. It had been very warm at the music-hall and the two drinks she had had, along with all the smoke, had upset her stomach a bit. She had been quite impressed with Mademoiselle Amanda. She wouldn’t dare to appear in public wearing so little, but she had to admit that the lady had lovely skin."
- Qui donc ? demanda madame Putois.,- Who ? asked Madame Putois.,Virginie suddenly stooped down to her hostess and said with a smile:,Madame Putois inquired.
"Et puis, en rmontant,","And then, going up,","His song was one familiar to them all and even to the street, for the little crowd at the door joined in the chorus.","And that makes me so riled,"
"Par malheur, si l'on s'accoutume à tout, on n'a pas encore pu prendre l'habitude de ne point manger. C'était uniquement là ce qui défrisait Gervaise. Elle se moquait d'être la dernière des dernières, au fin fond du ruisseau, et de voir les gens s'essuyer, quand elle passait près d'eux. Les mauvaises manières ne la gênaient plus, tandis que la faim lui tordait toujours les boyaux. Oh ! elle avait dit adieu aux petits plats, elle était descendue à dévorer tout ce qu'elle trouvait. Les jours de noce, maintenant, elle achetait chez le boucher des déchets de viande à quatre sous la livre, las de traîner et de noircir dans une assiette ; et elle mettait ça avec une potée de pommes de terre, qu'elle touillait au fond d'un poêlon. Ou bien elle fricassait un cœur de bœuf, un rata dont elle se léchait les lèvres. D'autres fois, quand elle avait du vin, elle se payait une trempette, une vraie soupe de perroquet. Les deux sous de fromage d'Italie, les boisseaux de pommes blanches, les quarts de haricots secs cuits dans leur jus, étaient encore des régals qu'elle ne pouvait plus se donner souvent. Elle tombait aux arlequins, dans les gargots borgnes, où, pour un sou, elle avait des tas d'arêtes de poisson mêlées à des rognures de rôti gâté. Elle tombait plus bas, mendiait chez un restaurateur charitable les croûtes des clients, et faisait une panade, en les laissant mitonner le plus longtemps possible sur le fourneau d'un voisin. Elle en arrivait, les matins de fringale, à rôder avec les chiens, pour voir aux portes des marchands, avant le passage des boueux ; et c'était ainsi qu'elle avait parfois des plats de riches, des melons pourris, des maquereaux tournés, des côtelettes dont elle visitait le manche, par crainte des asticots. Oui, elle en était là ; ça répugne les délicats, cette idée ; mais si les délicats n'avaient rien tortillé de trois jours, nous verrions un peu s'ils bouderaient contre leur ventre ; ils se mettraient à quatre pattes et mangeraient aux ordures comme les camarades. Ah ! la crevaison des pauvres, les entrailles vides qui crient la faim, le besoin des bêtes claquant des dents et s'empiffrant de choses immondes, dans ce grand Paris si doré et si flambant ! Et dire que Gervaise s'était fichu des ventrées d'oie grasse ! Maintenant, elle pouvait s'en torcher le nez. Un jour, Coupeau lui ayant chipé deux bons de pain pour les revendre et les boire, elle avait failli le tuer d'un coup de pelle, affamée, enragée par le vol de ce morceau de pain.","Unfortunately, if you get used to everything, you haven't yet been able to get into the habit of not eating. That was the only thing that relaxed Gervaise. She didn't care that she was the last of the last, at the bottom of the stream, and that she saw people wiping themselves when she passed them. Bad manners no longer bothered her, while hunger still twisted her guts. Oh ! she had said goodbye to small dishes, she had come down to devour everything she found. On wedding days, now, she bought scrap meat at four cents a pound from the butcher, tired of lying around and blackening on a plate; and she put that with a pot of potatoes, which she stirred at the bottom of a saucepan. Or else she was frying a heart of beef, a rata of which she was licking her lips. Other times, when she had wine, she treated herself to a dip, a real parrot soup. The two sous of Italian cheese, the bushels of white apples, the quarter beans cooked in their juice, were still treats that she could no longer indulge in often. She fell into the harlequins, into the one-eyed gargots, where, for a penny, she had heaps of fish bones mixed with trimmings from spoiled roast meat. She fell lower, begged customers' crusts from a charitable restaurateur, and made a panade, letting them simmer as long as possible on a neighbor's stove. She ended up, on craving mornings, prowling around with the dogs, to see at the doors of the merchants, before the muddy ones passed; and it was thus that she sometimes had rich dishes, rotten melons, overturned mackerel, chops whose handle she visited, for fear of the maggots. Yes, there she was; it repels the delicate, this idea; but if the delicates hadn't squirmed for three days, we'd see if they sulked against their bellies; they would get on all fours and eat from the garbage like their comrades. Ah! the flat tires of the poor, the empty entrails crying out for hunger, the need of beasts chattering their teeth and stuffing themselves with filthy things, in this great Paris so gilded and so blazing! And to think that Gervaise didn't give a damn about fat goose bellies! Now she could wipe her nose. One day, Coupeau having stolen two vouchers of bread from her to resell and drink them, she had nearly killed him with a shovel, starving, enraged by the theft of this piece of bread.","In fact, she hated everyone on that especial day. Unfortunately people can't live without eating, and before the woman's famished eyes floated visions of food. Not of dainty little dishes. She had long since ceased to care for those and ate all she could get without being in the least fastidious in regard to its quality. When she had a little money she bought a bullock's heart or a bit of cheese or some beans, and sometimes she begged from a restaurant and made a sort of panada of the crusts they gave her, which she cooked on a neighbor's stove. She was quite willing to dispute with a dog for a bone. Once the thought of such things would have disgusted her, but at that time she did not—for three days in succession—go without a morsel of food. She remembered how last week Coupeau had stolen a half loaf of bread and sold it, or rather exchanged it, for liquor.","One could get used to almost anything, but still, it is hard to break the habit of eating. That was the one thing that really annoyed Gervaise, the hunger that kept gnawing at her insides. Oh, those pleasant little snacks she used to have. Now she had fallen low enough to gobble anything she could find. On special occasions, she would get waste scraps of meat from the butcher for four sous a pound. Blacked and dried out meat that couldn’t find a purchaser. She would mix this with potatoes for a stew. On other occasions, when she had some wine, she treated herself to a sop, a true parrot’s pottage. Two sous’ worth of Italian cheese, bushels of white potatoes, quarts of dry beans, cooked in their own juice , these also were dainties she was not often able to indulge in now. She came down to leavings from low eating dens, where for a sou she had a pile of fish-bones, mixed with the parings of moldy roast meat. She fell even lower—she begged a charitable eating-house keeper to give her his customers’ dry crusts, and she made herself a bread soup, letting the crusts simmer as long as possible on a neighbor’s fire. On the days when she was really hungry, she searched about with the dogs, to see what might be lying outside the tradespeople’s doors before the dustmen went by; and thus at times she came across rich men’s food, rotten melons, stinking mackerel and chops, which she carefully inspected for fear of maggots. Yes, she had come to this. The idea may be a repugnant one to delicate-minded folks, but if they hadn’t chewed anything for three days running, we should hardly see them quarreling with their stomachs; they would go down on all fours and eat filth like other people. Ah! the death of the poor, the empty entrails, howling hunger, the animal appetite that leads one with chattering teeth to fill one’s stomach with beastly refuse in this great Paris, so bright and golden! And to think that Gervaise used to fill her belly with fat goose! Now the thought of it brought tears to her eyes. One day, when Coupeau bagged two bread tickets from her to go and sell them and get some liquor, she nearly killed him with the blow of a shovel, so hungered and so enraged was she by this theft of a bit of bread."
- Elle doit venir me prendre ? Et l'on se porte bien chez vous ?,- She has to come and pick me up? And are you doing well at home?,"""She is coming for me. Is everyone well with you?""",“She’s coming to fetch me. And are they all well at home?”
"Gervaise, peu à peu, s'attendrissait. Une lâcheté du cœur et des sens la prenait, au milieu de ce désir brutal dont elle se sentait enveloppée. Elle ne hasardait plus que des objections timides, les mains tombées sur ses jupes, la face noyée de douceur. Du dehors, par la fenêtre entrouverte, la belle nuit de juin envoyait des souffles chauds, qui effaraient la chandelle, dont la haute mèche rougeâtre charbonnait ; dans le grand silence du quartier endormi, on entendait seulement les sanglots d'enfant d'un ivrogne, couché sur le dos, au milieu du boulevard ; tandis que, très loin, au fond de quelque restaurant, un violon jouait un quadrille canaille à quelque noce attardée, une petite musique cristalline, nette et déliée comme une phrase d'harmonica. Coupeau, voyant la jeune femme à bout d'arguments, silencieuse et vaguement souriante, avait saisi ses mains, l'attirait vers lui. Elle était dans une de ces heures d'abandon dont elle se méfiait tant, gagnée, trop émue pour rien refuser et faire de la peine à quelqu'un. Mais le zingueur ne comprit pas qu'elle se donnait ; il se contenta de lui serrer les poignets à les broyer, pour prendre possession d'elle ; et ils eurent tous les deux un soupir, à cette légère douleur, dans laquelle se satisfaisait un peu de leur tendresse.","Gervaise gradually softened. A cowardice of the heart and of the senses seized her, in the midst of this brutal desire in which she felt enveloped. She only risked timid objections, her hands falling on her skirts, her face drowned in sweetness. From outside, through the half-open window, the beautiful June night blew warm breaths, which frightened the candle, whose tall reddish wick was charring; in the great silence of the sleeping quarter, one heard only the childish sobs of a drunkard, lying on his back, in the middle of the boulevard; while, far away, at the back of some restaurant, a violin was playing a scoundrel quadrille at some belated wedding, a little crystalline music, clear and delicate like a phrase from a harmonica. Coupeau, seeing the young woman at the end of her arguments, silent and vaguely smiling, seized her hands and drew her towards him. She was in one of those hours of abandonment of which she was so wary, won over, too moved to refuse anything and hurt someone. But the zinc worker did not understand that she was giving herself away; he contented himself with squeezing her wrists so as to crush them, in order to take possession of her; and they both sighed, at that slight pain, in which their tenderness was somewhat satisfied.","Gervaise melted by degrees. Her resolution forsook her, and a weakness of her heart and her senses overwhelmed her in the face of this brutal passion. She ventured only a timid objection or two. Her hands lay loosely folded on her knees, while her face was very gentle and sweet. Through the open window came the soft air of a fair June night; the candle flickered in the wind; from the street came the sobs of a child, the child of a drunken man who was lying just in front of the door in the street. From a long distance the breeze brought the notes of a violin playing at a restaurant for some late marriage festival—a delicate strain it was, too, clear and sweet as musical glasses. Coupeau, seeing that the young woman had exhausted all her arguments, snatched her hands and drew her toward him. She was in one of those moods which she so much distrusted, when she could refuse no one anything. But the young man did not understand this, and he contented himself with simply holding her hands closely in his.","Little by little, Gervaise gave way. Her emotions began to take control when faced with his encompassing desire. Still, with her hands in her lap and her face suffused with a soft sweetness, she hesitantly offered objections. From outside, through the half-open window, a lovely June night breathed in puffs of sultry air, disturbing the candle with its long wick gleaming red like a glowing coal. In the deep silence of the sleeping neighborhood the only sound was the infantile weeping of a drunkard lying in the middle of the street. Far away, in the back room of some restaurant, a violin was playing a dance tune for some late party. Coupeau was silent. Then, knowing she had no more arguments, he smiled, took hold of her hands and pulled her toward him. She was in one of those moments of weakness she so greatly mistrusted, persuaded at last, too emotionally stirred to refuse anything or to hurt anyone’s feelings. Coupeau didn’t realize that she was giving way. He held her wrists so tightly as to almost crush them. Together they breathed a long sigh that to both of them meant a partial satisfaction of their desire."
"Il venait d'apercevoir la concierge traversant la chaussée. Elle leva la tête, le reconnut. Et une conversation s'engagea du toit au trottoir. Elle cachait ses mains sous son tablier, le nez en l'air. Lui, debout maintenant, son bras gauche passé autour d'un tuyau, se penchait.","He had just seen the concierge crossing the road. She looked up, recognized him. And a conversation started from the roof to the sidewalk. She hid her hands under her apron, her nose in the air. He, standing now, his left arm around a pipe, was bending over.","She looked up, laughed, and a brisk conversation ensued between the roof and the street. She stood with her hands under her apron and her face turned up, while he, with one arm round a flue, leaned over the side of the house.","He had just caught sight of the concierge crossing the road. She raised her head and recognised him, and a conversation ensued between them. She hid her hands under her apron, her nose elevated in the air. He, standing up now, his left arm passed round a chimney-pot, leant over."
"Elle tâcha d'enjamber l'ivrogne et dut se retenir à un coin de la commode, pour ne pas glisser dans la saleté. Coupeau barrait complètement le lit. Alors, Lantier, qui avait un petit rire en voyant bien qu'elle ne ferait pas dodo sur son oreiller cette nuit-là, lui prit la main, en disant d'une voix basse et ardente :","She tried to step over the drunkard and had to hold on to a corner of the chest of drawers, so as not to slip in the dirt. Coupeau completely barred the bed. Then Lantier, who had a little laugh on seeing clearly that she would not be sleeping on her pillow that night, took her hand, saying in a low, ardent voice:","""I can't stay here!"" Lantier snatched her hand.","She tried to step over the drunkard, but had to catch hold of a corner of the chest of drawers to save herself from slipping in the mess. Coupeau completely blocked the way to the bed. Then, Lantier, who laughed to himself on seeing that she certainly could not sleep on her own pillow that night, took hold of her hand, saying, in a low and angry voice:"
"Il hésita un instant, gêné par les yeux ardents qu'elle fixait sur lui.","He hesitated for a moment, embarrassed by the burning eyes she fixed on him.","He hesitated a moment, uneasy under the earnest gaze she fixed upon him. ""","He hesitated for an instant, embarrassed by the piercing glance she fixed upon him."
"Il parlait de l'empereur. Le sergent de ville répondit d'un ton sec, sans lever les yeux :","He was talking about the emperor. The sergeant de ville replied in a dry tone, without raising his eyes:",After this she had only to rinse the floor after sweeping the dirty water into the gutter.,"He was talking about the Emperor. The policeman did not raise his eyes, but curtly answered: “If you were the Government you wouldn’t be so fat.”"
"Et lorsqu'on lui eut apporté un verre de vitriol, et que sa mâchoire se contracta, à la première gorgée, le zingueur reprit, en se tapant sur les cuisses :","And when they had brought him a glass of vitriol, and his jaw contracted, at the first sip, the zinc worker continued, slapping his thighs:",And when a glass of the vitriol was brought to her Coupeau bade,"And when they had brought her a glass of the vitriol, the rotgut, and her jaws had contracted at the first mouthful, the zinc-worker resumed, slapping his thighs:"
"Mais il s'emberlificota dans les jupons, qui lui barraient le chemin, et faillit tomber.","But he got tangled up in the petticoats, which blocked his way, and nearly fell.",As he spoke he gave a sudden lurch and fell among the skirts.,But he caught his foot in the garments which barred the way and nearly fell.
"Orpheline on l'avait perdue,","Orphan we had lost her,","The other guests saw nothing, so entirely absorbed were they in the touching words which Mme Lerat was still singing.",It sounded like a moaning wail of the wind and Madame Putois was so moved that she spilled her wine over the table.
- J'ai une tierce à l'égout et trois colombes ? Les crinolines ne me quittent pas.,- I have a third in the sewer and three doves? The crinolines do not leave me.,"Lantier did not reply instantly, but presently, as the others emptied their glasses, he began to read aloud an account of a frightful murder, to which they listened with eager interest.",Two bottles of wine and five glasses were scattered about the table.
"Il restait du café, heureusement. Maman Coupeau alla chercher un sixième verre, et Gervaise laissa Virginie se sucrer, par politesse. Les ouvrières s'écartèrent, firent à celle-ci une petite place près de la mécanique. Elle grelotta un instant, le nez rouge, serrant ses mains raidies autour de son verre, pour se réchauffer. Elle venait de chez l'épicier, où l'on gelait, rien qu'à attendre un quart de gruyère. Et elle s'exclamait sur la grosse chaleur de la boutique : vrai, on aurait cru entrer dans un four, ça aurait suffi pour réveiller un mort, tant ça vous chatouillait agréablement la peau. Puis, dégourdie, elle allongea ses grandes jambes. Alors, toutes les six, elles sirotèrent lentement leur café, au milieu de la besogne interrompue, dans l'étouffement moite des linges qui fumaient. Maman Coupeau et Virginie seules étaient assises sur des chaises ; les autres, sur leurs petits bancs, semblaient par terre ; même ce louchon d'Augustine avait tiré un coin du drap, sous le jupon, pour s'étendre. On ne parla pas tout de suite, les nez dans les verres, goûtant le café.","Fortunately, there was coffee left. Maman Coupeau went to get a sixth glass, and Gervaise left Virginie to drink sugar, out of politeness. The workers stepped aside, made a small place for her near the mechanics. She shivered for a moment, her nose red, clutching her stiffened hands around her glass, to warm herself. She had just come from the grocer's, where it was freezing, just waiting for a quarter of Swiss cheese. And she exclaimed about the great heat of the shop: true, you would have thought you were entering an oven, that would have been enough to wake the dead, so pleasantly did it tickle your skin. Then, alert, she stretched out her long legs. Then the six of them slowly sipped their coffee, in the middle of the interrupted work, in the damp suffocation of the smoking linens. Maman Coupeau and Virginie alone were seated on chairs; the others, on their little benches, seemed on the ground; even that squinty Augustine had pulled a corner of the sheet, under the petticoat, to lie down. We didn't speak right away, our noses in the glasses, tasting the coffee.","""You have come just in time for a cup of hot coffee,"" said Gervaise cordially. ""And I shall be only too glad to have it!"" answered Virginie with a shiver. She had been waiting at the grocer's, she said, until she was chilled through and through. The heat of that room was delicious, and then she stirred her coffee and said she liked the damp, sweet smell of the freshly ironed linen. She and Mamma Coupeau were the only ones who had chairs; the others sat on wooden footstools, so low that they seemed to be on the floor.","There was still some coffee left, luckily. Mother Coupeau went and fetched a sixth glass, and Gervaise let Virginie help herself to sugar out of politeness. The workwomen moved to give Virginie a small space close to the stove. Her nose was very red, she shivered a bit, pressing her hands which were stiff with cold around the glass to warm them. She had just come from the grocery store where you froze to death waiting for a quarter-pound of cheese and so she raved about the warmth of the shop. It felt so good on one’s skin. After warming up, she stretched out her long legs and the six of them relaxed together, supping their coffee slowly, surround by all the work still to be done. Mother Coupeau and Virginie were the only ones on chairs, the others, on low benches, seemed to be sitting on the floor. Squint-eyed Augustine had pulled over a corner of the cloth below the skirt, stretching herself out on it. No one spoke at first; all kept their noses in their glasses, enjoying their coffee."
"- Encore des potins, n'est-ce pas ? Elle est gentille, maman Coupeau, de pleurer misère partout ! ? Avant-hier, pourtant, elle a mangé ici. Nous faisons ce que nous pouvons, nous autres. Nous n'avons pas le Pérou ? Seulement, si elle va bavarder chez les autres, elle peut y rester, parce que nous n'aimons pas les espions.","- More gossip, isn't it? She's nice, Mama Coupeau, to cry misery everywhere! ? The day before yesterday, however, she ate here. We do what we can, the rest of us. We don't have Peru? Only, if she goes chatting to other people, she can stay there, because we don't like spies.","""What is this cry of poverty about? The old lady ate her dinner with us yesterday. We do all we can for her, I am sure. We have not the mines of Peru within our reach, but if she thinks she is to run to and fro between our houses she is much mistaken. I, for one, have no liking for spies.""","“More back-bitings, eh? She’s nice, mother Coupeau, to go and cry starvation everywhere! Yet only the day before yesterday she dined here. We do what we can. We haven’t got all the gold of Peru. Only if she goes about gossiping with others she had better stay with them, for we don’t like spies.”"
"- Madame Goujet, dit-elle enfin, si ça ne vous faisait rien, je prendrais l'argent du blanchissage, ce mois-ci.","- Madame Goujet, she said finally, if you didn't mind, I'll take the laundry money this month.","""Madame Goujet,"" she said at last, ""if you do not mind I should like to have the money for this week's wash.""","“Madame Goujet,” she said at length, “if it does not inconvenience you, I would like to take the money for the month’s washing.”"
- Oh ! c'est vilain de boire ! dit-elle à demi-voix.,- Oh ! it's bad to drink! she said in a low voice.,"""Ah, what an awful thing it is to drink!"" she said in a whisper to her friend, to whom she then went on to say how years before she had drunk anisette with her mother at Plassans and how it had made her so very sick that ever since that day she had never been able to endure even the smell of liquors.","“Oh, what a horrible thing it is to drink!” said she in a low voice."
- Qui donc ? demanda-t-elle.,- Who ? she asked.,"""He? Whom do you mean?""",“Who is?” asked she.
"Et on lui indiquait du coin de l'œil les deux premières communiantes qui se fourraient le nez dans leurs verres pour ne pas rire. Par convenance, les hommes eux-mêmes avaient choisi jusque-là les mots distingués. Mais madame Lerat n'accepta pas la leçon. Ce qu'elle venait de dire, elle l'avait entendu dans les meilleures sociétés. D'ailleurs, elle se flattait de savoir sa langue ; on lui faisait souvent compliment de la façon dont elle parlait de tout, même devant des enfants, sans jamais blesser la décence.","And they pointed out to him out of the corner of his eye the first two communicants who stuck their noses in their glasses so as not to laugh. For convenience, the men themselves had hitherto chosen the distinguished words. But Madame Lerat did not accept the lesson. What she had just said she had heard in the best societies. Besides, she flattered herself that she knew his language; she was often complimented on the way she talked about everything, even in front of children, without ever offending decency.","""It is clean work and pretty work too."" Whereupon ensued a warm discussion. The men were especially careful of their language out of deference to the little girls, but Mme Lerat would not accept the lesson: she flattered herself she could say what she pleased in such a way that it could not offend the most fastidious ears.","By side glances they reminded her of the two girls, fresh from communion, who were burying their noses in their glasses to keep from laughing out loud. The men had been very careful, for propriety’s sake, to use only suitable language, but Madame Lerat refused to follow their example. She flattered herself on her command of language, as she had often been complimented on the way she could say anything before children, without any offence to decency."

"- Mais non ! répondit l'autre ; je ne vous ai donc pas raconté ? ? Voici huit jours qu'ils ne sont plus ensemble. Adèle, un beau matin, a emporté ses frusques, et Lantier n'a pas couru après, je vous assure.","- But no ! answered the other; I didn't tell you? ? They haven't been together for eight days. Adèle, one fine morning, took her clothes, and Lantier did not run after them, I assure you.","""No indeed! But I have not told you all yet. They separated a week ago."" ""Separated!"" exclaimed the clearstarcher.","“No!” the other replied. “Didn’t I tell you? They separated last week. One morning, Adele moved out and Lantier didn’t chase after her.”"
"Oui, il était souffrant, il avait dû rentrer au lieu de se rendre à la forge, et il venait de s'étendre sur son fit pour se reposer. Madame Goujet causait gravement, en robe noire comme toujours, sa face blanche encadrée dans sa coiffe monacale. On avait encore baissé la journée des boulonniers ; de neuf francs, elle était tombée à sept francs, à cause des machines qui, maintenant, faisaient toute la besogne. Et elle expliquait qu'ils économisaient sur tout ; elle voulait de nouveau laver son linge elle-même. Naturellement, ce serait bien tombé, si les Coupeau lui avaient rendu l'argent prêté par son fils. Mais ce n'était pas elle qui leur enverrait les huissiers, puisqu'ils ne pouvaient pas payer. Depuis qu'elle parlait de la dette, Gervaise, la tête basse, semblait suivre le jeu agile de son aiguille reformant les mailles une à une.","Yes, he was ill, he had to go home instead of going to the forge, and he had just stretched out on his bed to rest. Madame Goujet was talking gravely, in a black dress as always, her white face framed in her monastic headdress. The day of the bolters had been lowered still further; from nine francs, it had fallen to seven francs, because of the machines which now did all the work. And she explained that they economized on everything; she wanted to do her own laundry again. Naturally, it would have been a good thing if the Coupeaus had given him back the money lent by his son. But it was not she who would send them the bailiffs, since they could not pay. Ever since she had been talking about the debt, Gervaise, her head bent, seemed to follow the agile play of her needle reforming the stitches one by one.","""He is not well; at least he has just come in and is lying down to rest a little."" Mme Goujet spoke very slowly, almost solemnly, her pale face encircled by her white cap, and wearing, as usual, her plain black dress. And she explained that they were obliged to economize very closely. In future she herself would do their washing. Of course Gervaise must know that this would not be necessary had she and her husband paid their debt to her son. But of course they would submit; they would never think of going to law about it. While she spoke of the debt her needle moved rapidly to and fro in the delicate meshes of her work.","Yes, he was not well. He had been obliged to come home instead of returning to the forge, and he had gone to lie down on his bed to get a rest. Madame Goujet talked gravely, wearing her black dress as usual and her white face framed in her nun-like coif. The pay at the forge had been cut again. It was now only seven francs a day because the machines did so much of the work. This forced her to save money every way she could. She would do her own washing from now on. It would naturally have been very helpful if the Coupeaus had been able to return her the money lent them by her son; but she was not going to set the lawyers on them, as they were unable to pay. As she was talking about the debt, Gervaise lowered her eyes in embarrassment."
"- Oui, il dort, répondit Gervaise, qui ne put s'empêcher de rougir.","""Yes, he's asleep,"" replied Gervaise, who couldn't help blushing.","""Yes, he is asleep,"" answered Gervaise with flushing cheeks.","“Yes, he’s asleep,” replied Gervaise, who could not avoid blushing."
"- Trois cent cinquante ! ? T'as donc marché dedans, bougre de lascar ! Ah ! zut ! je ne joue plus !","- Three hundred fifty ! ? So you walked in it, you bastard! Ah! Damn ! I do not play anymore !","Behind her the still was at work with constant drip-drip, and she felt a mad desire to grapple with it as with some dangerous beast and tear out its heart.","“Three hundred and fifty! You must have been inside it, you confounded lascar! Ah! I shan’t play any more!”"

"- Non, non, je vous jure ? Il me poussait, il allait m'embrasser, c'est vrai ; mais sa figure n'a pas même touché la mienne, et c'était la première fois qu'il essayait ? Oh ! tenez, sur ma vie, sur celle de mes enfants, sur tout ce que j'ai de plus sacré !","- No, no, I swear? He was pushing me, he was going to kiss me, it's true; but his face didn't even touch mine, and it was the first time he had tried? Oh ! look, on my life, on that of my children, on all that is most sacred to me!","I swear to you that you are wrong! He was going to kiss me, but his lips did not touch me, and it is the very first time that he made the attempt. Believe me, for I swear—on all that I hold most sacred—that I am telling you the truth.""","“No, no, I swear to you. He was pushing against me, trying to kiss me, but his face never even touched mine. It’s true, and that was the first time he tried.

"Lantier, attendri par ce dessert continu, se montrait paternel pour Gervaise. Il lui donnait des conseils, la grondait de ne plus aimer le travail. Que diable ! une femme, à son âge, devait savoir se retourner ! Et il l'accusait d'avoir toujours été gourmande. Mais, comme il faut tendre la main aux gens, même lorsqu'ils ne le méritent guère, il tâchait de lui trouver de petits travaux. Ainsi, il avait décidé Virginie à faire venir Gervaise une fois par semaine pour laver la boutique et les chambres ; ça la connaissait, l'eau de potasse ; et, chaque fois, elle gagnait trente sous. Gervaise arrivait le samedi matin, avec un seau et sa brosse, sans paraître souffrir de revenir ainsi faire une sale et humble besogne, la besogne des torchons de vaisselle, dans ce logement où elle avait trôné en belle patronne blonde. C'était un dernier aplatissement, la fin de son orgueil.","Lantier, touched by this continual dessert, showed himself paternal to Gervaise. He gave her advice, scolded her for no longer liking work. What the hell ! a woman at her age should know how to turn around! And he accused her of having always been greedy. But, since you have to reach out to people, even when they hardly deserve it, he tried to find odd jobs for her. So he had decided Virginie to have Gervaise come once a week to wash the shop and the rooms; they knew it, potash water; and each time she earned thirty sous. Gervaise would arrive on Saturday mornings, with a bucket and her brush, without seeming to suffer from returning to do her dirty and humble work, the work of dishcloths, in this apartment where she had sat enthroned as a beautiful blonde landlady. It was a final flattening, the end of his pride.","Gervaise appeared on Saturday mornings with her bucket and brush, without seeming to suffer a single pang at doing this menial work in the house where she had lived as mistress.","Softened by this perpetual dessert, Lantier showed himself paternal towards Gervaise. He gave her advice and scolded her because she no longer liked to work. Indeed! A woman of her age ought to know how to turn herself round. And he accused her of having always been a glutton. Nevertheless, as one ought to hold out a helping hand, even to folks who don’t deserve it, he tried to find her a little work. Thus he had prevailed upon Virginie to let Gervaise come once a week to scrub the shop and the rooms. That was the sort of thing she understood and on each occasion she earned her thirty sous. Gervaise arrived on the Saturday morning with a pail and a scrubbing brush, without seeming to suffer in the least at having to perform a dirty, humble duty, a charwoman’s work in the dwelling-place where she had reigned as the beautiful fair-haired mistress. It was a last humiliation, the end of her pride."
"Et il se caressa le menton, en consultant la société d'un clignement de paupières.","And he stroked his chin, consulting society with a blink.","""We could go to the Musée du Louvre, I suppose,"" and he smoothed his chin while awaiting the effect of this proposition.","And he stroked his chin, as he blinkingly consulted the other members of the party."
"- Ah ! non, mademoiselle Clémence, remettez votre camisole. Vous savez, je n'aime pas les indécences. Pendant que vous y êtes, montrez toute votre boutique. Il y a déjà trois hommes arrêtés en face.","- Oh! no, Mademoiselle Clemence, put your camisole back on. You know, I don't like indecency. While you're at it, show off your entire store. There are already three men arrested opposite.","""Put on your sack, Clémence; there are three men looking in, and I don't like such things.""","“Ah, no! Mademoiselle Clemence, you mustn’t take your camisole off. You know I don’t like such indecencies. Whilst you’re about it, you’d better show everything. There’s already three men over the way stopping to look.”"
"Et il fallait souvent que Coupeau s'en mêlât, tapant du poing, gueulant avec des jurons :","And Coupeau often had to get involved, banging his fist, yelling with oaths:","She had a quaint little trick of sticking out the tip of her tongue between her white teeth, and this habit, for some reason, exasperated her mother.","Coupeau would often get involved, pounding his fist, swearing and shouting:"
- Vous apportez bien tout ? demanda madame Goujet.,- Do you bring everything? asked Madame Goujet.,"""Have you brought everything?"" asked Mme Goujet, who was very exacting on this point.",“Are you sure you’ve brought everything?” asked Madame Goujet.
"Mais Gervaise, tout d'un coup, entra, attirée par les hurlements de la petite. Devant un pareil tableau, elle fut prise d'une indignation furieuse.","But Gervaise suddenly came in, attracted by the child's screams. Before such a picture, she was seized with furious indignation.",The door opened and Gervaise entered. She had heard the noise. She stood aghast at the scene and then was seized with noble rage.,"But Gervaise suddenly entered the room, attracted by the child’s howls. On beholding such a scene she was seized with a furious indignation."

"Gervaise en arrêt, le menton tendu, la face convulsée, ne répondait pas, n'ayant point encore le coup de gosier de Paris. L'autre continua :","Gervaise stopped, her chin outstretched, her face convulsed, did not answer, not yet having the stroke of the Parisian throat. The other continued:","Gervaise stood motionless, her face convulsed and lips apart. The other continued:","Gervaise, standing on the defensive, her chin thrust out, her features convulsed, said nothing, not having yet acquired the Paris gift of street gab. The other continued:"
"M. Madinier exaltait le cartonnage ; il y avait de vrais artistes, dans la partie ; ainsi, il citait des bottes d'étrennes, dont il connaissait les modèles, des merveilles de luxe. Lorilleux, pourtant, ricanait ; il était très vaniteux de travailler l'or, il en voyait comme un reflet sur ses doigts et sur toute sa personne. Enfin, disait-il souvent, les bijoutiers, au temps jadis, portaient l'épée ; et il citait Bernard Palissy, sans savoir. Coupeau, lui, racontait une girouette, un chef-d'œuvre d'un de ses camarades ; ça se composait d'une colonne, puis d'une gerbe, puis d'une corbeille de fruits, puis d'un drapeau ; le tout, très bien reproduit, fait rien qu'avec des morceaux de zinc découpés et soudés. Madame Lerat montrait à Bibi-la-Grillade comment on tournait une queue de rose, en roulant le manche de son couteau entre ses doigts osseux. Cependant, les voix montaient, se croisaient ; on entendait, dans le bruit, des mots lancés très haut par madame Fauconnier, en train de se plaindre de ses ouvrières, d'un petit chausson d'apprentie qui lui avait encore brûlé, la veille, une paire de draps.","M. Madinier exalted cardboard; there were real artists in the game; thus, he quoted New Year's Eve boots, of which he knew the models, marvels of luxury. Lorilleux, however, sneered; he was very vain to work with gold, he saw a reflection of it on his fingers and on his whole person. Finally, he often said, the jewelers, in former times, wore the sword; and he quoted Bernard Palissy, without knowing. Coupeau was recounting a weather vane, a masterpiece by one of his comrades; it consisted of a column, then a sheaf, then a basket of fruit, then a flag; the whole, very well reproduced, made with nothing but cut and welded pieces of zinc. Madame Lerat was showing Bibi-la-Grillade how to twist a rose stem, by rolling the handle of her knife between her bony fingers. However, the voices rose, crossed each other; you could hear, in the noise, words thrown very loudly by Madame Fauconnier, in the process of complaining about her workers, about a little apprentice's slipper which had burned a pair of sheets for her the day before.","Madinier declared that boxmaking was an art, and he cited the New Year bonbon boxes as wonders of luxury. Lorilleux talked of his chains, of their delicacy and beauty. He said that in former times jewelers wore swords at their sides. Coupeau described a weathercock made by one of his comrades out of tin. Mme Lerat showed Bibi-la-Grillade how a rose stem was made by rolling the handle of her knife between her bony fingers, and Mme Fauconnier complained loudly of one of her apprentices who the night before had badly scorched a pair of linen sheets.","Monsieur Madinier raved about the cardboard business. There were some real artists. For an example, he mentioned Christmas gift boxes, of which he’d seen samples that were marvels of splendor. Lorilleux sneered at this; he was extremely vain because of working with gold, feeling that it gave a sort of sheen to his fingers and his whole personality. “In olden times jewelers wore swords like gentlemen.” He often cited the case of Bernard Palissy, even though he really knew nothing about him. Coupeau told of a masterpiece of a weather vane made by one of his fellow workers which included a Greek column, a sheaf of wheat, a basket of fruit, and a flag, all beautifully worked out of nothing but strips of zinc shaped and soldered together. Madame Lerat showed Bibi-the-Smoker how to make a rose by rolling the handle of her knife between her bony fingers. All the while, their voices had been rising louder and louder, competing for attention. Shrill comments by Madame Fauconnier were heard. She complained about the girls who worked for her, especially a little apprentice who was nothing but a tart and had badly scorched some sheets the evening before."
"La blanchisseuse allait tous les samedis chez les Goujet pour reporter leur linge. Ils habitaient toujours la petite maison de la rue Neuve de la Goutte-d'Or. La première année, elle leur avait rendu régulièrement vingt francs par mois, sur les cinq cents francs ; afin de ne pas embrouiller les comptes, on additionnait le livre à la fin du mois seulement, et elle ajoutait l'appoint nécessaire pour compléter les vingt francs, car le blanchissage des Goujet, chaque mois, ne dépassait guère sept ou huit francs. Elle venait donc de s'acquitter de la moitié de la somme environ, lorsque, un jour de terme, ne sachant plus par où passer, des pratiques lui ayant manqué de parole, elle avait dû courir chez les Goujet et leur emprunter son loyer. Deux autres fois, pour payer ses ouvrières, elle s'était adressée également à eux, si bien que la dette se trouvait remontée à quatre cent vingt-cinq francs. Maintenant, elle ne donnait plus un sou, elle se libérait par le blanchissage, uniquement. Ce n'était pas qu'elle travaillât moins ni que ses affaires devinssent mauvaises. Au contraire. Mais il se faisait des trous chez elle, l'argent avait l'air de fondre, et elle était contente, quand elle pouvait joindre les deux bouts. Mon Dieu ! pourvu qu'on vive, n'est-ce pas ? on n'a point trop à se plaindre. Elle engraissait, elle cédait à tous les petits abandons de son embonpoint naissant, n'ayant plus la force de s'effrayer en songeant à l'avenir. Tant pis ! l'argent viendrait toujours, ça le rouillait de le mettre de côté.","The laundress went every Saturday to the Goujets to carry their laundry. They still lived in the little house in the rue Neuve de la Goutte-d'Or. The first year, she had regularly paid them twenty francs a month, out of the five hundred francs; so as not to confuse the accounts, the book was added up only at the end of the month, and she added the amount necessary to complete the twenty francs, for the Goujets' laundering each month scarcely exceeded seven or eight francs. So she had just paid about half of the sum, when, one day at the end of her term, not knowing where to go, due to practices having broken her word, she had to run to the Goujets and borrow her rent. Twice other times, to pay her workers, she had applied to them as well, so that the debt was raised to four hundred and twenty-five francs. Now, she no longer gave a penny, she freed herself by laundering, only. It wasn't that she was working less or that her business was getting bad. On the contrary. But there were holes in her house, the money seemed to be melting away, and she was happy when she could make ends meet. My God ! as long as we live, right? we don't have too much to complain about. She grew fat, she gave in to all the little abandonments of her budding plumpness, no longer having the strength to be frightened by thinking of the future. Too bad ! the money would always come, it rusted him to put it aside.","In this way she had paid half the money she had borrowed, when one quarter day, not knowing to whom to turn, as she had not been able to collect her bills punctually, she ran to the Goujets' and borrowed the amount of her rent from them. Twice since she had asked a similar favor, so that the amount of her indebtedness now stood at four hundred and twenty-five francs. Now she no longer paid any cash but did their washing. It was not that she worked less hard or that her business was falling off. Quite the contrary; but money had a way of melting away in her hands, and she was content nowadays if she could only make both ends meet. What was the use of fussing, she thought? If she could manage to live that was all that was necessary. She was growing quite stout withal. Mme Goujet was always kind to Gervaise, not because of any fear of losing her money, but because she really loved her and was afraid of her going wrong in some way.","The laundress went every Saturday to the Goujets to deliver their washing. They still lived in the little house in the Rue Neuve de la Goutte-d’Or. During the first year she had regularly repaid them twenty francs a month; so as not to jumble up the accounts, the washing-book was only made up at the end of each month, and then she added to the amount whatever sum was necessary to make the twenty francs, for the Goujets’ washing rarely came to more than seven or eight francs during that time. She had therefore paid off nearly half the sum owing, when one quarter day, not knowing what to do, some of her customers not having kept their promises, she had been obliged to go to the Goujets and borrow from them sufficient for her rent. On two other occasions she had also applied to them for the money to pay her workwomen, so that the debt had increased again to four hundred and twenty-five francs. Now, she no longer gave a halfpenny; she worked off the amount solely by the washing. It was not that she worked less, or that her business was not so prosperous. But something was going wrong in her home; the money seemed to melt away, and she was glad when she was able to make both ends meet. Mon Dieu! What’s the use of complaining as long as one gets by. She was putting on weight and this caused her to become a bit lazy. She no longer had the energy that she had in the past. Oh well, there was always something coming in."
"- C'est pour que je me tue. Non, je ne me jetterai pas ! ? Toute cette eau, ça signifie que je n'ai pas de cœur. Non, je ne me jetterai pas !","- It's for me to kill myself. No, I will not throw myself! ? All this water means I have no heart. No, I will not throw myself!","""No, I will not throw myself over! All that water would drown me! No, I will not!""","“It’s so that I may kill myself. No, I won’t throw myself in! All that water means that I’ve no heart. No, I won’t throw myself in!”"
"- Rien, ce n'est rien, dit enfin la blanchisseuse d'une voix étranglée. Je n'ai besoin de rien. Merci.","- Nothing, it's nothing, finally said the laundress in a strangled voice. I do not need anything. Thank you.","answered the laundress in a choked voice. ""I am very much obliged.""","“It’s nothing, nothing,” said the laundress at length in a choking voice. “I don’t require anything, thanks.”"
"La noce se regardait, se tâtait. Non Gervaise ne connaissait pas ça ; madame Fauconnier non plus, ni Boche, ni les autres, Coupeau croyait bien être monté un dimanche, mais il ne se souvenait plus bien. On hésitait cependant, lorsque madame Lorilleux, sur laquelle l'importance de M. Madinier produisait une grande impression, trouva l'offre très comme il faut, très honnête. Puisqu'on sacrifiait la journée, et qu'on était habillé, autant valait-il visiter quelque chose pour son instruction. Tout le monde approuva. Alors, comme la pluie tombait encore un peu, on emprunta au marchand de vin des parapluies, de vieux parapluies, bleus, verts, marron, oubliés par les clients ; et l'on partit pour le musée.","The wedding party looked at each other, probing each other. No Gervaise didn't know that; Neither did Madame Fauconnier, neither Boche nor the others, Coupeau thought he had gone up on a Sunday, but he no longer remembered clearly. They hesitated, however, when Madame Lorilleux, on whom the importance of M. Madinier produced a great impression, found the offer very proper, very honest. Since we sacrificed the day, and we were dressed, it was better to visit something for his education. Everyone approved. So, as the rain was still falling a little, we borrowed umbrellas from the wine merchant, old umbrellas, blue, green, brown, forgotten by the customers; and off we went to the museum.","They all looked at each other. Gervaise had never even heard of the place, nor had Mme Fauconnier nor Boche. Coupeau thought he had been there one Sunday, but he was not sure, but Mme Lorilleux, on whom Madinier's air of importance had produced a profound impression, approved of the idea. The day was wasted anyway; therefore, if a little instruction could be got it would be well to try it. As the rain was still falling, they borrowed old umbrellas of every imaginable hue from the establishment and started forth for the Musée du Louvre.","They looked at each other interrogatively. No, Gervaise had never been; Madame Fauconnier neither, nor Boche, nor the others. Coupeau thought he had been one Sunday, but he was not sure. They hesitated, however, when Madame Lorilleux, greatly impressed by Monsieur Madinier’s importance, thought the suggestion a very worthy and respectable one. As they were wasting the day, and were all dressed up, they might as well go somewhere for their own instruction. Everyone approved. Then, as it still rained a little, they borrowed some umbrellas from the proprietor of the wineshop, old blue, green, and brown umbrellas, forgotten by different customers, and started off to the Museum."
"Elle ne répondit rien. Elle était toute tremblante. Elle avait dû causer de Lantier avec Virginie, car celle-ci poussa son mari et Goujet, en leur criant de marcher les premiers. Les deux femmes se mirent ensuite aux côtés du zingueur, pour l'occuper et l'empêcher de voir. Il était à peine allumé, plutôt étourdi d'avoir gueulé que d'avoir bu. Par taquinerie, comme elles semblaient vouloir suivre le trottoir de gauche, il les bouscula, il passa sur le trottoir de droite. Elles coururent, effrayées, et tâchèrent de masquer la porte de François. Mais Coupeau devait savoir que Lantier était là. Gervaise demeura stupide, en l'entendant grogner :","She didn't answer. She was all shaking. She must have been talking about Lantier with Virginie, for the latter pushed her husband and Goujet aside, shouting at them to go first. The two women then went to the sides of the zinc worker, to occupy him and prevent him from seeing. He was barely on, rather dazed from yelling than from drinking. By teasing, as they seemed to want to follow the sidewalk on the left, he jostled them, he passed on the sidewalk on the right. They ran, frightened, and tried to hide Francois' door. But Coupeau must have known that Lantier was there. Gervaise remained stupid, hearing him growl:","She did not reply. She was trembling from head to foot. She had been speaking of Lantier to Virginie and begged the other to go on in front, while the two women walked on either side of Coupeau to prevent him from seeing Lantier as they passed the open window where he sat eating his dinner. But Coupeau knew that Lantier was there, for he said:","She did not answer. She was all in a tremble. She must have said something about Lantier to Virginie, for the latter pushed her husband and Goujet ahead, telling them to walk in front. The two women got on each side of Coupeau to keep him occupied and prevent him seeing Lantier. He wasn’t really drunk, being more intoxicated from shouting than from drinking. Since they seemed to want to stay on the left side, to tease them, he crossed over to the other side of the street. Worried, they ran after him and tried to block his view of the door of Francois’s. But Coupeau must have known that Lantier was there. Gervaise almost went out of her senses on hearing him grunt:"
"- Ah bien ! dit Lantier, si jamais on la réduit par de bonnes paroles ! Il faudrait un maillet pour lui entrer ça dans le crâne.","- Ah well ! said Lantier, if ever we reduce it by good words! It would take a mallet to ram that into his head.",When the others came in she looked up suddenly and said to Virginie gently:,"“Ah! well,” said Lantier, “one never yet brought her to reason by fair words; it wants a mallet to drive it into her head.”"
"- D'ailleurs, raconta-t-il, j'ai vu un soir le comte de Chambord ?","""Besides,"" he said, ""I saw the Comte de Chambord one evening?""","He did not say distinctly what he expected, but it was clear that it was something very agreeable.","“Besides,” observed he, “I saw the Count de Chambord one evening.”"
"Au fond, Gervaise ne se sentait pas devant Lantier si courageuse qu'elle le disait. Certes, elle était bien résolue à ne pas lui permettre de la toucher seulement du bout des doigts ; mais elle avait peur, s'il la touchait jamais, de sa lâcheté ancienne, de cette mollesse et de cette complaisance auxquelles elle se laissait aller, pour faire plaisir au monde. Lantier, pourtant, ne recommença pas sa tentative. Il se trouva plusieurs fois seul avec elle et se tint tranquille. Il semblait maintenant occupé de la tripière, une femme de quarante-cinq ans, très bien conservée. Gervaise, devant Goujet, parlait de la tripière, afin de le rassurer. Elle répondait à Virginie et à madame Lerat, quand celles-ci faisaient l'éloge du chapelier, qu'il pouvait bien se passer de son admiration, puisque toutes les voisines avaient des béguins pour lui.","Deep down, Gervaise did not feel as courageous as she claimed to be in front of Lantier. Certainly, she was determined not to allow him to touch her only with the tips of his fingers; but she was afraid, if he ever touched her, of her old cowardice, of that softness and complacency to which she let herself go, to please the world. Lantier, however, did not renew his attempt. He found himself several times alone with her and kept quiet. He now seemed to be occupied with the tripière, a very well-preserved woman of forty-five. Gervaise, in front of Goujet, was talking about tripière, in order to reassure him. She replied to Virginie and Madame Lerat, when they praised the hatter, that he could well do without her admiration, since all the neighbors had crushes on him.","In reality Gervaise was more afraid of Lantier than she was willing to admit even to herself. She was fully determined never to allow the smallest familiarity, but she was afraid that she might yield to his persuasions, for she well knew the weakness and amiability of her nature and how hard it was for her to persist in any opposition to anyone. Lantier, however, did not put this determination on her part to the test. He was often alone with her now and was always quiet and respectful. Coupeau declared to everyone that Lantier was a true friend.","Gervaise, at heart, did not feel as courageous when with Lantier as she said. She was, indeed, perfectly resolved not to hear his flattery, even with the slightest interest; but she was afraid, if ever he should touch her, of her old cowardice, of that feebleness and gloominess into which she allowed herself to glide, just to please people. Lantier, however, did not avow his affection. He several times found himself alone with her and kept quiet. He seemed to think of marrying the tripe-seller, a woman of forty-five and very well preserved. Gervaise would talk of the tripe-seller in Goujet’s presence, so as to set his mind at ease. She would say to Virginie and Madame Lerat, whenever they were singing the hatter’s praises, that he could very well do without her admiration, because all the women of the neighborhood were smitten with him."
"Et elle se mettait à genoux, toute secouée d'un désir qui la pâlissait. Jamais elle ne s'était ainsi roulée aux pieds d'un homme. La trogne du père Bazouge, avec sa bouche tordue et son cuir encrassé par la poussière des enterrements, lui semblait belle et resplendissante comme un soleil. Cependant, le vieux, mal éveillé, croyait à quelque mauvaise farce.","And she got down on her knees, all shaken by a desire that made her pale. She had never rolled herself thus at the feet of a man. Father Bazouge's face, with its twisted mouth and leather clogged with burial dust, seemed to her beautiful and resplendent like the sun. However, the old man, half awake, believed in some bad joke.","And she knelt before him, a lurid light blazing in her haggard eyes. Father Bazonge, with garments stained by the dust of the cemetery, seemed to her as glorious as the sun. But the old man, yet half asleep, rubbed his eyes and could not understand her.","She fell on her knees, all shaken with a desire which caused her to turn ghastly pale. Never before had she thus dragged herself at a man’s feet. Old Bazouge’s ugly mug, with his mouth all on one side and his hide begrimed with the dust of funerals, seemed to her as beautiful and resplendent as a sun. The old fellow, who was scarcely awake thought, however, that it was some sort of bad joke."
"- C'est ça, j'aime mieux ça, gardez votre argent ! ? Je prends maman Coupeau, entendez-vous ! J'ai ramassé un chat l'autre soir, je peux bien ramasser votre mère.

She shall want for nothing. Good heavens, what people!""","rather it was so; keep your money! I’ll give mother Coupeau a home, do you hear? I picked up a cat the other evening, so I can at least do the same for your mother. And she shall be in want of nothing; she shall have her coffee and her drop of brandy! Good heavens! what a vile family!”"

"Elle était accroupie par terre, devant une terrine, occupée à passer du linge à l'amidon. En jupon blanc, la camisole retroussée aux manches et glissée des épaules, elle avait les bras nus, le cou nu, toute rose, si suante, que des petites mèches blondes de ses cheveux ébouriffés se collaient à sa peau. Soigneusement, elle trempait dans l'eau laiteuse des bonnets, des devants de chemises d'homme, des jupons entiers, des garnitures de pantalons de femme. Puis, elle roulait les pièces et les posait au fond d'un panier carré, après avoir plongé dans un seau et secoué sa main sur les corps des chemises et des pantalons qui n'étaient pas amidonnés.","She was squatting on the ground, in front of a bowl, busy washing the starch. In a white petticoat, the camisole rolled up at the sleeves and slipped from the shoulders, her arms were bare, her neck was bare, all rosy, so sweaty that little blond locks of her disheveled hair clung to her skin. Carefully, she soaked in the milky water bonnets, fronts of men's shirts, whole petticoats, trimmings of women's trousers. Then she would roll up the pieces and put them in the bottom of a square basket, after dipping into a bucket and shaking her hand over the bodies of the shirts and pants that weren't starched.","""What a melting day!"" said Gervaise, who was stooping over a great bowl of starch. She had rolled up her sleeves and taken off her sack and stood in her chemise and white skirt; the soft hair in her neck was curling on her white throat. She dipped each cuff in the starch, the fronts of the shirts and the whole of the skirts. Then she rolled up the pieces tightly and placed them neatly in a square basket after having sprinkled with clear water all those portions which were not starched.","She was sitting on the floor, in front of a basin, starching some things. Her sleeves were rolled up and her camisole was slipping down her shoulders. Little curls of golden hair were stuck to her skin by perspiration. She carefully dipped caps, shirt-fronts, entire petticoats, and the trimmings of women’s drawers into the milky water. Then she rolled the things up and placed them at the bottom of a square basket, after dipping her hand in a pail and shaking it over the portions of the shirts and drawers which she had not starched."
"- Va te coucher n'est-ce pas ? Tu vois, nous sommes occupées ; tu nous gênes ? Ça fait trente-deux mouchoirs, madame Bijard ; et deux autres, trente-quatre ?","- Go to bed, right? See, we're busy; are you bothering us? That makes thirty-two handkerchiefs, Madame Bijard; and two others, thirty-four?","""You had best go and lie down,"" she said pleasantly. ""We are very busy, and you are in our way. Did I say thirty-two handkerchiefs, Madame Bijard? Here are two more; that makes thirty-four.""","Then in a maternal tone of voice she added, “Now go to bed, won’t you? You see we’re busy; you’re in our way. That makes thirty-two handkerchiefs, Madame Bijard; and two more, thirty-four.”"
"- Non, je ne connais pas d'homme aussi dégoûtant ! dit madame Boche, plus furieuse que les autres. Tais-toi, entends-tu ! Tu dégoûterais une armée ? Vous savez que c'est pour tout manger !","- No, I don't know such a disgusting man! said Madame Boche, more furious than the others. Shut up, do you hear! Would you disgust an army? You know it's for eating everything!","Gervaise devoured large slices of the breast, hardly speaking, but a little ashamed of her own gluttony in the presence of Goujet.",None were so agreeable in company as retired soldiers. The policeman allowed several minutes for the company to admire the bishop’s mitre and then finished cutting the slices and arranging them on the platter.
"- Allons, commence ! dit Goujet, en plaçant lui-même dans la clouière un des morceaux de fer, de la grosseur d'un poignet de fille. Bec-Salé, dit Boit-sans-Soif, se renversa, donna le branle à Dédèle, des deux mains. Petit, desséché, avec sa barbe de bouc et ses yeux de loup, luisant sous sa tignasse mal peignée, il se cassait à chaque volée du marteau, sautait du sol comme emporté par son élan. C'était un rageur, qui se battait avec son fer, par embêtement de le trouver si dur ; et même il poussait un grognement, quand il croyait lui avoir appliqué une claque soignée. Peut-être bien que l'eau-de-vie amollissait les bras des autres, mais lui avait besoin d'eau-de-vie dans les veines, au lieu de sang ; la goutte de tout à l'heure lui chauffait la carcasse comme une chaudière, il se sentait une sacrée force de machine à vapeur. Aussi, le fer avait-il peur de lui, ce soir-là ; il l'aplatissait plus mou qu'une chique. Et Dédèle valsait, il fallait voir ! Elle exécutait le grand entrechat, les petons en l'air, comme une baladeuse de l'Elysée-Montmartre, qui montre son linge ; car il s'agissait de ne pas flâner, le fer est si canaille, qu'il se refroidit tout de suite, à la seule fin de se ficher du marteau. En trente coups, Bec-Salé, dit Boit-sans-Soif, avait façonné la tête de son boulon. Mais il soufflait, les yeux hors de leurs trous, et il était pris d'une colère furieuse en entendant ses bras craquer. Alors, emballé, dansant et gueulant, il allongea encore deux coups, uniquement pour se venger de sa peine. Lorsqu'il le retira de la clouière, le boulon, déformé, avait la tête mal plantée d'un bossu.","- Come on, start! said Goujet, himself placing one of the pieces of iron the size of a girl's wrist in the nail pit. Bec-Salé, known as Boit-sans-Soif, leaned back and gave Dédèle the motion with both hands. Small, withered, with his goatee's beard and his wolf's eyes, gleaming under his unkempt mop of hair, he broke with each volley of the hammer, jumped from the ground as if carried away by his momentum. He was a madman, who fought with his iron, out of annoyance at finding it so hard; and he even groaned when he thought he had applied a neat slap to her. Brandy may have softened other people's arms, but he needed brandy in his veins instead of blood; the gout from earlier was heating his carcass like a boiler, he felt the sacred strength of a steam engine. So the iron was afraid of him that night; he flattened it softer than a quid. And Dédèle was waltzing, you had to see! She performed the grand entrechat, toes in the air, like a walker from the Elysée-Montmartre, showing her linen; because it was a question of not loitering, the iron is so mean that it gets cold right away, for the sole purpose of not caring about the hammer. In thirty blows, Bec-Sale, known as Boit-sans-Soif, had fashioned the head of his bolt. But he was panting, his eyes out of their holes, and he was seized with furious anger when he heard his arms crack. So, carried away, dancing and yelling, he laid down two more blows, only to avenge his pain. When he took it out of the nail pit, the bolt, deformed, had the misplaced head of a hunchback.","he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","“Now then, off you go!” said Goujet, placing one of the pieces of iron, as thick as a girl’s wrist, in the tool-hole. Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst, leant back, and swung Dedele round with both hands. Short and lean, with his goatee bristling, and with his wolf-like eyes glaring beneath his unkempt hair, he seemed to snap at each swing of the hammer, springing up from the ground as though carried away by the force he put into the blow. He was a fierce one, who fought with the iron, annoyed at finding it so hard, and he even gave a grunt whenever he thought he had planted a fierce stroke. Perhaps brandy did weaken other people’s arms, but he needed brandy in his veins, instead of blood. The drop he had taken a little while before had made his carcass as warm as a boiler; he felt he had the power of a steam-engine within him. And the iron seemed to be afraid of him this time; he flattened it more easily than if it had been a quid of tobacco. And it was a sight to see how Dedele waltzed! She cut such capers, with her tootsies in the air, just like a little dancer at the Elysee Montmartre, who exhibits her fine underclothes; for it would never do to dawdle, iron is so deceitful, it cools at once, just to spite the hammer. With thirty blows, Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst, had fashioned the head of his bolt. But he panted, his eyes were half out of his head, and got into a great rage as he felt his arms growing tired. Then, carried away by wrath, jumping about and yelling, he gave two more blows, just out of revenge for his trouble. When he took the bolt from the hole, it was deformed, its head being askew like a hunchback’s."
"Gervaise resta un moment indécise. Elle était tentée de repousser du pied le paquet de linge, de s'asseoir là, à coudre. La respiration régulière de Lantier finit par la rassurer. Elle prit la boule de bleu et le morceau de savon qui lui restaient de son dernier savonnage ; et s'approchant des petits qui jouaient tranquillement avec de vieux bouchons, devant la fenêtre, elle les baisa, en leur disant à voix basse :","Gervaise remained undecided for a moment. She was tempted to push away the bundle of laundry with her foot, to sit there, sewing. Lantier's steady breathing ended up reassuring her. She took the ball of bruise and the piece of soap that she had left from her last soaping; and approaching the little ones who were quietly playing with old corks in front of the window, she kissed them, saying to them in a low voice:","Gervaise hesitated; she was tempted to give up her plan of going to the lavatory and thought she would sit down to her sewing. But at last she was reassured by Lantier's regular breathing; she took her soap and her ball of bluing and, going to the children, who were playing on the floor with some old corks, she said in a low voice:","Gervaise, for a while, remained undecided. She was tempted to kick the bundle of dirty clothes on one side, and to sit down and sew. But Lantier’s regular breathing ended by reassuring her. She took the ball of blue and the piece of soap remaining from her last washing, and going up to the little ones who were quietly playing with some old corks in front of the window, she kissed them, and said in a low voice:"
"Et elle l'examinait, inquiète, retrouvant sur son visage de joli garçon la même dureté, comme si rien, désormais, ne devait le fléchir. Il se fâcha, lui arracha des mains le linge qu'il rejeta dans la malle.","And she examined him, worried, finding the same hardness on his pretty boy's face, as if nothing now should bend him. He got angry, snatched the laundry from her hands and threw it back in the trunk.",And she looked at him with some anxiety. He angrily tore the things from her hands and threw them back into the trunk.,"She studied his boyishly handsome face, now so rigid that it seemed nothing could ever soften it. He angrily grabbed his things from her and threw them back into the trunk, saying:"
"Mais Coupeau, qui venait de retrouver dans le cavalier de sa fille le jeune homme maigre au paletot, se fichait pas mal du monde.","But Coupeau, who had just found the skinny young man in the overcoat in his daughter's jumper, didn't give a damn about the world.",Coupeau discovered that his daughter's partner was the young man for whom he had been looking.,"But Coupeau, who had just recognized his daughter’s cavalier as the scraggy young man in the coat, did not care a fig for what the people said."
"Ce fut précisément ce samedi que Gervaise fit une drôle de rencontre, comme elle descendait l'escalier des Goujet. Elle dut se ranger contre la rampe, avec son panier, pour laisser passer une grande femme en cheveux qui montait, en portant sur la main, dans un bout de papier, un maquereau très frais, les ouïes saignantes. Et voilà qu'elle reconnut Virginie, la fille dont elle avait retroussé les jupes au lavoir. Toutes deux se regardèrent bien en face. Gervaise ferma les yeux, car elle crut un instant qu'elle allait recevoir le maquereau par la figure. Mais non, Virginie eut un mince sourire. Alors, la blanchisseuse, dont le panier bouchait l'escalier, voulut se montrer polie.","It was precisely this Saturday that Gervaise had a strange encounter, as she was coming down the Goujets' staircase. She had to pull over against the banister, with her basket, to let a tall woman with hair pass who was coming upstairs, carrying in her hand, in a piece of paper, a very fresh mackerel, her gills bleeding. And now she recognized Virginie, the girl whose skirts she had rolled up in the laundry. Both looked each other squarely in the face. Gervaise closed her eyes, for she thought for a moment that she was going to take the mackerel in the face. But no, Virginie smiled thinly. Then the laundress, whose basket was blocking the stairs, wanted to be polite.","When Gervaise was on the staircase her heart was light, for she cared little for the reproof now that she had the ten francs in her hand; she was becoming accustomed to paying one debt by contracting another. Midway on the stairs she met a tall woman coming up with a fresh mackerel in her hand, and behold! it was Virginie, the girl whom she had whipped in the lavatory. The two looked each other full in the face. Gervaise instinctively closed her eyes, for she thought the girl would slap her in the face with the mackerel. But, no; Virginie gave a constrained smile. Then the laundress, whose huge basket filled up the stairway and who did not choose to be outdone in politeness, said:","It was also on that Saturday that Gervaise met with a rather strange adventure as she descended the Goujets’ staircase. She was obliged to stand up close against the stair-rail with her basket to make way for a tall bare-headed woman who was coming up, carrying in her hand a very fresh mackerel, with bloody gills, in a piece of paper. She recognized Virginie, the girl whose face she had slapped at the wash-house. They looked each other full in the face. Gervaise shut her eyes. She thought for a moment that she was going to be hit in the face with the fish. But no, Virginie even smiled slightly. Then, as her basket was blocking the staircase, the laundress wished to show how polite she, too, could be."
"Maman Coupeau s'était placée en face de la porte, pour voir le nez des Lorilleux. Elle tirait Gervaise par la jupe, elle l'emmena dans la pièce du fond. Et, toutes deux penchées au-dessus du potage, elles causèrent vivement, à voix basse.","Maman Coupeau had placed herself in front of the door, to see the Lorilleux's noses. She pulled Gervaise by the skirt, she led her into the back room. And, both leaning over the soup, they chatted briskly, in low voices.",Mamma Coupeau drew Gervaise into the next room.,Mother Coupeau had placed herself opposite the door to see the faces the Lorilleuxs would make. She pulled Gervaise by the skirt and dragged her into the back-room. And as they both leant over the soup they conversed rapidly in a low voice.
"- Rien n'est meilleur avant la soupe, déclara Boche, avec un claquement de langue. Ça vaut mieux qu'un coup de pied au derrière.","- Nothing is better than soup, declared Boche, with a click of the tongue. Better than a kick in the ass.","""It is a good thing before soup,"" muttered Boche.","“Nothing is better before soup,” declared Boche, smacking his lips."
- Tu ne reconnais pas ce monsieur ? demanda celui-ci.,- You don't recognize this gentleman? asked this one.,"""Do you know this gentleman?"" said his mother.",“Don’t you remember this gentleman?” asked the latter.
"Et, lorsqu'il empoigna Gervaise dans ses grosses mains noires, il fut pris d'une tendresse, il souleva doucement cette femme. qui avait eu un si long béguin pour lui. Puis, en l'allongeant au fond de la bière avec un soin paternel, il bégaya, entre deux hoquets :","And when he grabbed Gervaise in his big black hands, he was seized with tenderness, he gently lifted this woman. who had had such a long crush on him. Then, laying him down in the beer with paternal care, he stammered, between two gasps:","And when he lifted Gervaise in his great, coarse hands he did it tenderly. And as he laid her gently in her coffin he murmured between two hiccups:","And when he took hold of Gervaise in his big, dirty hands, he was seized with emotion, and he gently raised this woman who had had so great a longing for his attentions. Then, as he laid her out with paternal care at the bottom of the coffin, he stuttered between two hiccoughs:"
"Gervaise, poursuivie par ce bagou infernal, marchait vite. Puis, elle se trouva seule au milieu de la foule, elle ralentit le pas. Elle était bien résolue. Entre voler et faire ça, elle aimait mieux faire ça, parce qu'au moins elle ne causerait du tort à personne. Elle n'allait jamais disposer que de son bien. Sans doute, ce n'était guère propre ; mais le propre et le pas propre se brouillaient dans sa caboche, à cette heure ; quand on crève de faim, on ne cause pas tant philosophie, on mange le pain qui se présente. Elle était remontée jusqu'à la chaussée Clignancourt. La nuit n'en finissait plus d'arriver. Alors, en attendant, elle suivit les boulevards, comme une dame qui prend l'air avant de rentrer pour la soupe.","Gervaise, pursued by this infernal bagou, walked quickly. Then, she found herself alone in the middle of the crowd, she slowed down. She was quite determined. Between stealing and doing this, she preferred to do this, because at least she wouldn't harm anyone. She was never going to dispose of anything but her property. No doubt it was hardly clean; but the clean and the clean step were confused in his noggin at this hour; when you're starving, you don't talk so much about philosophy, you eat whatever bread comes your way. She had gone up to the Chaussée Clignancourt. The night just kept coming. So, while waiting, she followed the boulevards, like a lady taking the air before returning for soup.","Gervaise, with this infernal mirth ringing in her ears, hurried down the street. She was determined to take this desperate step. She had only a choice between that and theft, and she considered that she had a right to dispose of herself as she pleased. The question of right and wrong did not present itself very clearly to her eyes. ""When one is starving is hardly the time,"" she said to herself, ""to philosophize. "" She walked slowly up and down the boulevard.","With these words ringing in her ears, Gervaise walked softly away. But when she found herself alone in the midst of the crowd, she slackened her pace. She was quite resolute. Between thieving and the other, well she preferred the other; for at all events she wouldn’t harm any one. No doubt it wasn’t proper. But what was proper and what was improper was sorely muddled together in her brain. When you are dying of hunger, you don’t philosophize, you eat whatever bread turns up. She had gone along as far as the Chaussee-Clignancourt. It seemed as if the night would never come. However, she followed the Boulevards like a lady who is taking a stroll before dinner."
"- Merci, répondit Bibi-la-Grillade, je me purge ? Faut proposer ça à Mes-Bottes, qui cherchait hier une baraque ? Attends, Mes-Bottes est bien sûr là-dedans.","- Thank you, answered Bibi-la-Grillade, I'm purging myself? Do you have to offer that to My-Boots, who was looking for a barrack yesterday? Wait, My-Boots is of course in there.","""It won't be me then,"" answered Bibi. ""I wash my hands of them all. No more masters for me, I tell you! But I dare say Mes-Bottes would be glad of the offer.""","“No thanks,” answered Bibi-the-Smoker; “I’m purging myself. You should ask My-Boots. He was looking for something yesterday. Wait a minute. My-Boots is most likely in there.”"
"Et elle appela la société sur la porte du marchand de vin, pour voir les nuages, un orage d'un noir d'encre qui montait rapidement au sud de Paris. Madame Lerat, l'aînée des Coupeau, était une grande femme, sèche, masculine, parlant du nez, fagotée dans une robe puce trop large, dont les longs effilés la faisaient ressembler à un caniche maigre sortant de l'eau. Elle jouait avec son ombrelle comme avec un bâton. Quand elle eut embrassé Gervaise, elle reprit :","And she called the company on the door of the wine merchant, to see the clouds, an inky black storm that was mounting rapidly south of Paris. Madame Lerat, the eldest of the Coupeaus, was a tall woman, lean, masculine, speaking with her nose, bundled up in an oversized smart dress, the long tapering of which made her look like a thin poodle emerging from the water. She played with her parasol as with a stick. When she had kissed Gervaise, she resumed:","And she bade them all look out the window to see how black the clouds were. Mme Lerat, Coupeau's eldest sister, was a tall, thin woman, very masculine in appearance and talking through her nose, wearing a puce-colored dress that was much too loose for her. It was profusely trimmed with fringe, which made her look like a lean dog just coming out of the water. She brandished an umbrella as she talked, as if it had been a walking stick. As she kissed Gervaise she said:","And she called everyone to the door of the wineshop to see the clouds as black as ink which were rising rapidly to the south of Paris. Madame Lerat, eldest of the Coupeaus, was a tall, gaunt woman who talked through her nose. She was unattractively dressed in a puce-colored robe that hung loosely on her and had such long dangling fringes that they made her look like a skinny poodle coming out of the water. She brandished her umbrella like a club. After greeting Gervaise, she said, “You’ve no idea."

- Quoi donc ?,- What ?,"""What is it?""",“Look at what?”
"Ils ne parlèrent pas de sa jambe. Mais Gervaise comprenait, à leurs regards obliques et au pincement de leurs lèvres, qu'ils y faisaient allusion. Elle restait devant eux, serrée dans son mince châle à palmes jaunes, répondant par des monosyllabes, comme devant des juges. Coupeau, la voyant souffrir, finit par crier :","They didn't talk about his leg. But Gervaise understood, from their oblique glances and the purse of their lips, that they were alluding to it. She remained in front of them, wrapped tightly in her thin shawl with yellow palm leaves, answering in monosyllables, as before a judge. Coupeau, seeing her suffer, ended by shouting:","Say, Lorilleux, don't you think that Madame looks delicate?"" This courteous pair made no allusion to her lameness, but Gervaise felt it to be in their minds. She sat stiff and still before them, her thin shawl with its yellow palm leaves wrapped closely about her, and answered in monosyllables, as if before her judges. Coupeau, realizing her sufferings, cried out:","They did not mention her leg; but Gervaise understood by their side glances, and the curling of their lips, that they were alluding to it. She stood before them, wrapped in her thin shawl with the yellow palms, replying in monosyllables, as though in the presence of her judges. Coupeau, seeing she was suffering, ended by exclaiming:"
"Il disait ça pour parler. Gervaise tournait justement le dos à la rue des Poissonniers. Et ils montèrent vers Montmartre, côte à côte, sans se prendre le bras. Ils devaient avoir la seule idée de s'éloigner de la fabrique, pour ne pas paraître se donner des rendez-vous devant la porte. La tête basse, ils suivaient la chaussée défoncée, au milieu du ronflement des usines. Puis, à deux cents pas, naturellement, comme s'ils avaient connu l'endroit, ils filèrent à gauche, toujours silencieux, et s'engagèrent dans un terrain vague. C'était, entre une scierie mécanique et une manufacture de boutons, une bande de prairie restée verte, avec des plaques jaunes d'herbe grillée ; une chèvre, attachée à un piquet, tournait en bêlant ; au fond, un arbre mort s'émiettait au grand soleil.","He said that to speak. Gervaise was just turning her back on the rue des Poissonniers. And they went up towards Montmartre, side by side, without taking each other's arm. They must have had the sole idea of getting away from the factory, so as not to appear to be making appointments in front of the door. Heads bowed, they followed the rutted roadway, amidst the hum of the factories. Then, at two hundred paces, of course, as if they had known the place, they sped off to the left, still silent, and entered a vacant lot. It was, between a mechanical sawmill and a button factory, a strip of meadow that had remained green, with yellow patches of roasted grass; a goat, tied to a stake, turned around, bleating; in the background, a dead tree was crumbling in the bright sunlight.","He hardly knew what he was saying, and they both turned toward Montmartre without another word. They merely wished to go away from the forge. They passed several manufactories and soon found themselves with an open field before them. A goat was tethered near by and bleating as it browsed, and a dead tree was crumbling away in the hot sun.","He only said that for something to say. They walked together up toward Montmartre, but without her taking his arm. They wanted to get a bit away from the factory so as not to seem to be having a rendezvous in front of it. They turned into a vacant lot between a sawmill and a button factory. It was like a small green meadow. There was even a goat tied to a stake."
"Pendant le premier mois, Nana s'amusa joliment de son vieux. Il fallait le voir, toujours en petoche autour d'elle. Un vrai fouille-au-pot, qui tâtait sa jupe par-derrière, dans la foule, sans avoir l'air de rien. Et ses jambes ! des cotrets de charbonnier, de vraies allumettes ! Plus de mousse sur le caillou, quatre cheveux frisant à plat dans le cou, si bien qu'elle était toujours tentée de lui demander l'adresse du merlan qui lui faisait la raie. Ah ! quel vieux birbe ! il était rien folichon !","During the first month, Nana amused herself with her old man. You had to see him, always petoche around her. A real digger, who felt her skirt from behind, in the crowd, without looking like anything. And his legs! coal cotrets, real matches! No more foam on the pebble, four hairs curling flat in her neck, so much so that she was always tempted to ask him for the address of the whiting that was parting her. Ah! what an old bugger! he was nothing fancy!","At first Nana thought the whole thing a great joke, but at the end of a month she began to be afraid of him. Often when she stopped before the jeweler's he would suddenly appear at her side and ask her what she wanted.","For the first month Nana was greatly amused with her old flirt. You should have seen him always dogging her—a perfect great nuisance, who followed far behind, in the crowd, without seeming to do so. And his legs! Regular lucifers. No more moss on his pate, only four straight hairs falling on his neck, so that she was always tempted to ask him where his hairdresser lived. Ah! what an old gaffer, he was comical and no mistake, nothing to get excited over."
"Lalie ne se plaignait plus. Elle souleva lentement ses paupières blanches, et voulut sourire de ses lèvres qu'un frisson convulsait.","Lalie no longer complained. She slowly lifted her white eyelids, and wanted to smile with her lips, which were convulsing with a shiver.",Lalie slowly lifted her white lids and tried to speak.,"Lalie no longer groaned. She slowly raised her white eyelids, and tried to compel her lips to smile, although they were convulsed by a shudder."
"- Ça fait tout de même du bien où ça passe, murmura Bibi-la-Grillade.","- It's still good where it goes, murmured Bibi-la-Grillade.","Lantier entered to join in, and Mes-Bottes stood there with his hat on the back of his head, shabby, dirty and staggering, ordering Father Colombe to pour out the glasses and not to cheat.","“That does some good when it goes down,” murmured Bibi-the-Smoker."
"Pendant trois années, la vie des deux familles coula, aux deux côtés du palier, sans un événement. Gervaise avait élevé la petite, en trouvant moyen de perdre, au plus, deux jours de travail par semaine. Elle devenait une bonne ouvrière de fin, gagnait jusqu'à trois francs. Aussi s'était-elle décidée à mettre Etienne, qui allait sur ses huit ans, dans une petite pension de la rue de Chartres, où elle payait cent sous. Le ménage, malgré la charge des deux enfants, plaçait des vingt francs et des trente francs chaque mois à la Caisse d'épargne. Quand leurs économies atteignirent la somme de six cents francs, la jeune femme ne dormit plus, obsédée d'un rêve d'ambition : elle voulait s'établir, louer une petite boutique, prendre à son tour des ouvrières. Elle avait tout calculé. Au bout de vingt ans, si le travail marchait, ils pouvaient avoir une rente, qu'ils iraient manger quelque part, à la campagne. Pourtant, elle n'osait se risquer. Elle disait chercher une boutique, pour se donner le temps de la réflexion. L'argent ne craignait rien à la Caisse d'épargne ; au contraire, il faisait des petits. En trois années, elle avait contenté une seule de ses envies, elle s'était acheté une pendule ; encore cette pendule, une pendule de palissandre, à colonnes torses, à balancier de cuivre doré, devait-elle être payée en un an, par acompte de vingt sous tous les lundis. Elle se fâchait, lorsque Coupeau parlait de la monter ; elle seule enlevait le globe, essuyait les colonnes avec religion, comme si le marbre de sa commode s'était transformé en chapelle. Sous le globe, derrière la pendule, elle cachait le livret de la Caisse d'épargne. Et souvent, quand elle rêvait à sa boutique, elle s'oubliait là, devant le cadran, à regarder fixement tourner les aiguilles, ayant l'air d'attendre quelque minute particulière et solennelle pour se décider.","For three years, the life of the two families flowed, on both sides of the landing, without an event. Gervaise had brought up the little one, finding a way to lose at most two days of work a week. She was becoming a good workwoman, earning up to three francs. So she had decided to put Etienne, who was about to turn eight, in a little boarding house in the rue de Chartres, where she paid a hundred sous. The household, in spite of the burden of the two children, invested twenty francs and thirty francs each month in the Caisse d'Epargne. When their savings reached the sum of six hundred francs, the young woman no longer slept, obsessed with an ambitious dream: she wanted to settle down, rent a little shop, take on workers in her turn. She had calculated everything. At the end of twenty years, if the work went well, they could have an income, which they would eat somewhere, in the countryside. Yet she dared not risk it. She said she was looking for a shop, to give herself time to think things over. Money feared nothing at the Caisse d'Epargne; on the contrary, he had babies. In three years, she had satisfied only one of her desires, she had bought herself a clock; yet this clock, a rosewood clock, with twisted columns, a gilded copper pendulum, had to be paid for in a year, by installments of twenty sous every Monday. She grew angry when Coupeau spoke of riding her; she alone removed the globe, wiped the columns religiously, as if the marble of her chest of drawers had been transformed into a chapel. Under the globe, behind the clock, she hid the Caisse d'Epargne passbook. And often, when she dreamed of her shop, she forgot herself there, in front of the dial, staring fixedly at the hands turning, as if she were waiting for some particular and solemn moment to make up her mind.","For three years the lives of these people flowed tranquilly on without an event. Gervaise had been elevated in the laundry where she worked, had higher wages and decided to place Etienne at school. Notwithstanding all her expenses of the household, they were able to save twenty and thirty francs each month. When these savings amounted to six hundred francs Gervaise could not rest, so tormented was she by ambitious dreams. She wished to open a small establishment herself and hire apprentices in her turn. She hesitated, naturally, to take the definite steps and said they would look around for a shop that would answer their purpose; their money in the savings bank was quietly rolling up. She had bought her clock, the object of her ambition; it was to be paid for in a year—so much each month. It was a wonderful clock, rosewood with fluted columns and gilt moldings and pendulum. She kept her bankbook under the glass shade, and often when she was thinking of her shop she stood with her eyes fixed on the clock, as if she were waiting for some especial and solemn moment.","For three years the existence of the two families went on, on either side of the landing, without an event. Gervaise was able to take care of her daughter and still work most of the week. She was now a skilled worker on fine laundry and earned up to three francs a day. She decided to put Etienne, now nearly eight, into a small boarding-school on Rue de Chartres for five francs a week. Despite the expenses for the two children, they were able to save twenty or thirty francs each month. Once they had six hundred francs saved, Gervaise often lay awake thinking of her ambitious dream: she wanted to rent a small shop, hire workers, and go into the laundry business herself. If this effort worked, they would have a steady income from savings in twenty years. They could retire and live in the country. Yet she hesitated, saying she was looking for the right shop. She was giving herself time to think it over. Their savings were safe in the bank, and growing larger. So, in three years’ time she had only fulfilled one of her dreams—she had bought a clock. But even this clock, made of rosewood with twined columns and a pendulum of gilded brass, was being paid for in installments of twenty-two sous each Monday for a year. She got upset if Coupeau tried to wind it; she liked to be the only one to lift off the glass dome. It was under the glass dome, behind the clock, that she hid her bank book. Sometimes, when she was dreaming of her shop, she would stare fixedly at the clock, lost in thought."

"Ah ! mon Dieu ! quelle vue ! Elle resta saisie. La cellule était matelassée du haut en bas ; par terre, il y avait deux paillassons, l'un sur l'autre ; et, dans un coin, s'allongeaient un matelas et un traversin, pas davantage. Là-dedans, Coupeau dansait et gueulait. Un vrai chienlit de la Courtille, avec sa blouse en lambeaux et ses membres qui battaient l'air ; mais un chienlit pas drôle, oh ! non, un chienlit dont le chahut effrayant vous faisait dresser tout le poil du corps. Il était déguisé en un-qui-va-mourir. Cré nom ! quel cavalier seul ! Il butait contre la fenêtre, s'en retournait à reculons, les bras marquant la mesure, secouant les mains, comme s'il avait voulu se les casser et les envoyer à la figure du monde. On rencontre des farceurs dans les bastringues, qui imitent ça ; seulement, ils l'imitent mal, il faut voir sauter ce rigodon des soûlards, si l'on veut juger quel chic ça prend, quand c'est exécuté pour de bon. La chanson a son cachet aussi, une engueulade continue de carnaval, une bouche grande ouverte lâchant pendant des heures les mêmes notes de trombone enroué. Coupeau, lui, avait le cri d'une bête dont on a écrasé la patte. Et, en avant l'orchestre, balancez vos dames !","Ah! my God ! what a view ! She remained gripped. The cell was padded from top to bottom; on the floor, there were two mats, one on top of the other; and in one corner lay a mattress and a bolster, no more. In there, Coupeau was dancing and yelling. A real mess of the Courtille, with his ragged blouse and his limbs throbbing in the air; but a not funny shit, oh! no, a mess whose frightening ruckus made all the hair on your body stand on end. He was disguised as one-who-is-going-to-die. Create name! what a lone rider! He stumbled against the window, turned back backwards, his arms marking time, shaking his hands, as if he wanted to break them and throw them in the face of the world. We meet pranksters in the bastringues, who imitate that; only, they imitate it badly, you have to see this rigodon of drunkards jump, if you want to judge what chic it takes, when it is executed for good. The song also has its character, a continuous carnival shouting match, a wide-open mouth dropping the same hoarse trombone notes for hours. Coupeau, he had the cry of an animal whose leg has been crushed. And, before the orchestra, swing your ladies!","Ah, what a sight it was! The cell was cushioned from the floor to the ceiling, and on the floor were mattresses on which Coupeau danced and howled in his ragged blouse. The sight was terrific. He threw himself wildly against the window and then to the other side of the cell, shaking hands as if he wished to break them off and fling them in defiance at the whole world. These wild motions are sometimes imitated, but no one who has not seen the real and terrible sight can imagine its horror.","Mon Dieu! what a sight! She stood as one transfixed. The cell was padded from the floor to the ceiling. On the floor there were two straw mats, one piled on top of the other; and in a corner were spread a mattress and a bolster, nothing more. Inside there Coupeau was dancing and yelling, his blouse in tatters and his limbs beating the air. He wore the mask of one about to die. What a breakdown! He bumped up against the window, then retired backwards, beating time with his arms and shaking his hands as though he were trying to wrench them off and fling them in somebody’s face. One meets with buffoons in low dancing places who imitate the delirium tremens, only they imitate it badly. One must see this drunkard’s dance if one wishes to know what it is like when gone through in earnest. The song also has its merits, a continuous yell worthy of carnival-time, a mouth wide open uttering the same hoarse trombone notes for hours together. Coupeau had the howl of a beast with a crushed paw. Strike up, music! Gentlemen, choose your partners!"

"Mais l'interne, qui regardait les pieds, dit non de la tête. Les pieds nus, hors du lit, dansaient toujours. Ils n'étaient guère propres, et ils avaient les ongles longs. Des heures encore passèrent. Tout d'un coup, ils se raidirent, immobiles. Alors, l'interne se tourna vers Gervaise, en disant :","But the intern, who was looking at the feet, shook his head no. The bare feet, out of bed, were still dancing. They were hardly clean, and they had long fingernails. Hours more passed. Suddenly they stiffened, motionless. Then the intern turned to Gervaise, saying:","But the surgeon, looking at the feet, said: ""No,"" for those poor feet were still dancing. Another hour, and yet another passed. Suddenly the feet were stiff and motionless, and the young surgeon turned to Gervaise.","But the house surgeon, who was watching the feet, shook his head. The bare feet, projecting beyond the mattress, still danced on. They were not particularly clean and the nails were long. Several more hours passed. All on a sudden they stiffened and became motionless. Then the house surgeon turned towards Gervaise, saying:"

"Gervaise, effrayée, se collait contre la porte de l'hôtel. Le père Bazouge, un croque-mort d'une cinquantaine d'années, avait son pantalon noir taché de boue, son manteau noir agrafé sur l'épaule, son chapeau de cuir noir cabossé, aplati dans quelque chute.","Gervaise, frightened, pressed herself against the door of the hotel. Father Bazouge, an undertaker in his fifties, had his black trousers stained with mud, his black coat hooked over the shoulder, his dented black leather hat, flattened in some fall.","Gervaise, in great terror, flew toward the door. Father Bazonge was a man of fifty; his clothes were covered with mud where he had fallen in the street.","Gervaise, frightened, squeezed up against the door of the hotel. Old Bazouge, an undertaker’s helper of some fifty years of age, had his black trousers all stained with mud, his black cape hooked on to his shoulder, and his black feather hat knocked in by some tumble he had taken."
"Cependant, madame Bijard nouait le linge en paquets. Elle parlait de sa petite, âgée de deux ans, une enfant nommée Eulalie, qui avait déjà de la raison comme une femme. On pouvait la laisser seule ; elle ne pleurait jamais, elle ne jouait pas avec les allumettes. Enfin, elle emporta les paquets de linge un à un, sa grande taille cassée sous le poids, sa face se marbrant de taches violettes.","Meanwhile, Madame Bijard tied the linen in bundles. She was talking about her little, two-year-old child named Eulalie, who already had reason as a woman. We could leave her alone; she never cried, she never played with matches. Finally, she carried away the bundles of laundry one by one, her tall waist broken under the weight, her face marbling with purple stains.","Mme Bijard tied up the linen and staggered off under their weight while Gervaise turned back to finish her cap. Alas! The stove and the irons were alike red hot; she must wait a quarter of an hour before she could touch the irons, and Gervaise covered the fire with a couple of shovelfuls of cinders.","Madame Bijard had meanwhile been tying the laundry up into bundles and talking about her daughter, Eulalie, who at two was as smart as a grown woman. She could be left by herself; she never cried or played with matches. Finally Madame Bijard took the laundry away a bundle at a time, her face splotched with purple and her tall form bent under the weight."
"Il la conduisit à droite, dans un autre hangar, où son patron installait toute une fabrication mécanique. Sur le seuil, elle hésita, prise d'une peur instinctive. La vaste salle, secouée par les machines, tremblait ; et de grandes ombres flottaient, tachées de feux rouges. Mais lui la rassura en souriant, jura qu'il n'y avait rien à craindre ; elle devait seulement avoir bien soin de ne pas laisser traîner ses jupes trop près des engrenages. Il marcha le premier, elle le suivit, dans ce vacarme assourdissant où toutes sortes de bruits sifflaient et ronflaient, au milieu de ces fumées peuplées d'êtres vagues, des hommes noirs affairés, des machines agitant leurs bras, qu'elle ne distinguait pas les uns des autres. Les passages étaient très étroits, il fallait enjamber des obstacles, éviter des trous, se ranger pour ne pas être bousculé. On ne s'entendait pas parler. Elle ne voyait rien encore, tout dansait. Puis, comme elle éprouvait au-dessus de sa tête la sensation d'un grand frôlement d'ailes, elle leva les yeux, elle s'arrêta à regarder les courroies, les longs rubans qui tendaient au plafond une gigantesque toile d'araignée, dont chaque fil se dévidait sans fin ; le moteur à vapeur se cachait dans un coin, derrière un petit mur de briques ; les courroies semblaient filer toutes seules, apporter le branle du fond de l'ombre, avec leur glissement continu, régulier, doux comme le vol d'un oiseau de nuit. Mais elle faillit tomber, en se heurtant à un des tuyaux du ventilateur, qui se ramifiait sur le sol battu, distribuant son souffle de vent aigre aux petites forges, près des machines. Et il commença par lui faire voir ça, il lâcha le vent sur un fourneau ; de larges flammes s'étalèrent des quatre côtés en éventail, une collerette de feu dentelée, éblouissante, à peine teintée d'une pointe de laque ; la lumière était si vive, que les petites lampes des ouvriers paraissaient des gouttes d'ombre dans du soleil. Ensuite, il haussa la voix pour donner des explications, il passa aux machines : les cisailles mécaniques qui mangeaient des barres de fer, croquant un bout à chaque coup de dents, crachant les bouts par-derrière, un à un ; les machines à boulons et à rivets, hautes, compliquées, forgeant les têtes d'une seule pesée de leur vis puissante ; les ébarbeuses, au volant de fonte, une boule de fonte qui battait l'air furieusement à chaque pièce dont elles enlevaient les bavures ; les taraudeuses, manœuvrées par des femmes, taraudant les boulons et leurs écrous, avec le tic-tac de leurs rouages d'acier luisant sous la graisse des huiles. Elle pouvait suivre ainsi tout le travail, depuis le fer en barre, dressé contre les murs, jusqu'aux boulons et aux rivets fabriqués, dont des caisses pleines encombraient les coins. Alors, elle comprit, elle eut un sourire en hochant le menton ; mais elle restait tout de même un peu serrée à la gorge, inquiète d'être si petite et si tendre parmi ces rudes travailleurs de métal, se retournant parfois, les sangs glacés, au coup sourd d'une ébarbeuse. Elle s'accoutumait à l'ombre, voyait des enfoncements où des hommes immobiles réglaient la danse haletante des volants, quand un fourneau lâchait brusquement le coup de lumière de sa collerette de flamme. Et malgré elle, c'était toujours au plafond qu'elle revenait, à la vie, au sang même des machines, au vol souple des courroies, dont elle regardait, les yeux levés, la force énorme et muette passer dans la nuit vague des charpentes.","He led her to the right, to another hangar, where his boss was setting up a whole machine shop. On the threshold, she hesitated, seized with an instinctive fear. The vast room, shaken by the machines, trembled; and great shadows floated, stained with red lights. But he reassured her with a smile, swore there was nothing to fear; she just had to be careful not to drag her skirts too close to the gears. He walked first, she followed him, in this deafening uproar where all sorts of noises hissed and roared, in the middle of this smoke populated by vague beings, busy black men, machines waving their arms, whom she could not distinguish. one another. The passages were very narrow, you had to step over obstacles, avoid holes, pull over so as not to be jostled. We couldn't hear each other speak. She still saw nothing, everything was dancing. Then, as she felt above her head the sensation of a great brushing of wings, she raised her eyes, she stopped to look at the straps, the long ribbons which stretched a gigantic spider's web to the ceiling, each thread of which unraveled endlessly; the steam engine was hidden in a corner, behind a low brick wall; the straps seemed to spin by themselves, bringing the motion from the depths of the shadows, with their continuous, regular glide, soft as the flight of a night bird. But it almost fell, colliding with one of the ventilator pipes, which branched out on the beaten ground, distributing its breath of sour wind to the small forges, near the machines. And he began by showing him that, he released the wind on a stove; broad flames fanned out on all four sides, a jagged, dazzling collar of fire, barely tinged with a hint of lacquer; the light was so bright that the workmen's little lamps looked like drops of shadow in the sun. Then he raised his voice to explain, he moved on to the machines: the mechanical shears that ate iron bars, crunching a piece with each bite, spitting out the pieces behind, one by one; the tall, complicated bolt and rivet machines, forging heads with a single weight of their mighty screw; the trimmers, at the wheel of cast iron, a ball of cast iron which beat the air furiously with each part from which they removed the burrs; the tapping machines, operated by women, tapping the bolts and their nuts, with the ticking of their steel cogs gleaming under the grease of the oils. She could thus follow all the work, from the bar iron, set up against the walls, to the fabricated bolts and rivets, with boxes full of them cluttering the corners. Then, she understood, she smiled, shaking her chin; but all the same she remained a little constricted in her throat, worried at being so small and so tender among these rough metal workers, turning occasionally, her blood chilling, at the dull thump of a trimmer. She grew accustomed to the shade, saw recesses where motionless men controlled the panting dance of the steering wheels, when a stove suddenly released the flash of light from its collar of flame. And in spite of herself, it was always to the ceiling that she returned, to life, to the very blood of the machines, to the supple flight of the straps, at which she watched, with raised eyes, the enormous and mute force passing in the vague night of the frames.","In this way she had paid half the money she had borrowed, when one quarter day, not knowing to whom to turn, as she had not been able to collect her bills punctually, she ran to the Goujets' and borrowed the amount of her rent from them.","He led her to another shed where the owner was installing a new machine. She hesitated in the doorway, oppressed by an instinctive dread. The great hall was vibrating from the machines and black shadows filled the air. He reassured her with a smile, swearing that there was nothing to fear, only she should be careful not to let her skirts get caught in any of the gears. He went first and she followed into the deafening hubbub of whistling, amid clouds of steam peopled by human shadows moving busily. The passages were very narrow and there were obstacles to step over, holes to avoid, passing carts to move back from. She couldn’t distinguish anything clearly or hear what Goujet was saying. Gervaise looked up and stopped to stare at the leather belts hanging from the roof in a gigantic spider web, each strip ceaselessly revolving. The steam engine that drove them was hidden behind a low brick wall so that the belts seemed to be moving by themselves. She stumbled and almost fell while looking up. Goujet raised his voice with explanations. There were the tapping machines operated by women, which put threads on bolts and nuts. Their steel gears were shining with oil. She could follow the entire process. She nodded her head and smiled. She was still a little tense, however, feeling uneasy at being so small among these rough metalworkers. She jumped back more than once, her blood suddenly chilled by the dull thud of a machine."
"- Oui, je ne t'en ai jamais parlé, parce que ça ne me regardait pas ; mais tu ne te gênais guère, je t'ai vue assez souvent te promener en chemise, en bas, quand papa ronflait ? Ça ne te plaît plus maintenant, mais ça plaît aux autres. Fiche-moi la paix, fallait pas me donner l'exemple !","- Yes, I never talked to you about it, because it didn't concern me; but you weren't embarrassed, I saw you quite often walking around in your shirt, downstairs, when Papa was snoring? You don't like it now, but others like it. Leave me alone, you shouldn't have given me the example!","""I have never said anything about it because it was none of my business, but do you think I did not know where you were when my father lay snoring? Let me alone. It was you who set me the example.""","“Yes, I never spoke to you about it, for it didn’t concern me; but you didn’t used to be very fussy. I often saw you when we lived at the shop sneaking off as soon as papa started snoring. So just shut up; you shouldn’t have set me the example.”"
"On mit le couvert sur l'établi. Chacun, en voyant les assiettes, songeait aux gueuletons qu'on avait faits là. Lantier était de retour. Lorilleux descendit. Un pâtissier venait d'apporter une tourte, car la blanchisseuse n'avait pas la tête à s'occuper de cuisine. Comme on s'asseyait, Boche entra dire que M. Marescot demandait à se présenter, et le propriétaire se présenta, très grave, avec sa large décoration sur sa redingote. Il salua en silence, alla droit au cabinet, où il s'agenouilla.","The cutlery was put on the workbench. Everyone, seeing the plates, thought of the feasts that had been made there. Lantier was back. Lorilleux descended. A pastry cook had just brought in a pie, because the laundress didn't have the head to worry about cooking. As we sat down, Boche came in to say that M. Marescot wanted to introduce himself, and the proprietor introduced himself, very grave, with his large decoration on his frock coat. He saluted in silence, went straight to the closet, where he knelt down.",After a while M. Marescot appeared. He went to the inner room and knelt at the side of the corpse.,"They laid the cloth on the work-table. Each one, on seeing the plates, thought of the feastings they had had on it. Lantier had returned. Lorilleux came down. A pastry-cook had just brought a meat pie, for the laundress was too upset to attend to any cooking. As they were taking their seats, Boche came to say that Monsieur Marescot asked to be admitted, and the landlord appeared, looking very grave, and wearing a broad decoration on his frock-coat. He bowed in silence and went straight to the little room, where he knelt down."
"Ah ! oui, par exemple, l'envie lui en venait ! C'est-à-dire que ça lui démangeait par tout le corps, de se cavaler et d'y passer, comme disait le père Coupeau. Il la faisait trop vivre dans cette idée-là, une fille honnête s'y serait allumée. Même, avec sa façon de gueuler, il lui apprit des choses qu'elle ne savait pas encore, ce qui était bien étonnant. Alors, peu à peu, elle prit de drôles de manières. Un matin, il l'aperçut qui fouillait dans un papier, pour se coller quelque chose sur la frimousse. C'était de la poudre de riz, dont elle emplâtrait par un goût pervers le satin si délicat de sa peau. Il la barbouilla avec le papier, à lui écorcher la figure, en la traitant de fille de meunier. Une autre fois, elle rapporta des rubans rouges pour retaper sa casquette, ce vieux chapeau noir qui lui faisait tant de honte. Et il lui demanda furieusement d'où venaient ces rubans. Hein ? c'était sur le dos qu'elle avait gagné ça ! Ou bien elle les avait achetés à la foire d'empoigne ? Salope ou voleuse, peut-être, déjà toutes les deux. A plusieurs reprises, il lui vit ainsi dans les mains des objets gentils, une bague de cornaline, une paire de manches avec une petite dentelle, un de ces cœurs en doublé, des « Tâtez-y », que les filles se mettent entre les deux nénais. Coupeau voulait tout piler ; mais elle défendait ses affaires avec rage, c'était à elle, des dames les lui avaient données, ou encore elle avait fait des échanges à l'atelier. Par exemple, le cœur, elle l'avait trouvé rue d'Aboukir. Lorsque son père écrasa son cœur d'un coup de talon, elle resta toute droite, blanche et crispée, tandis qu'une révolte intérieure la poussait à se jeter sur lui, pour lui arracher quelque chose. Depuis deux ans, elle rêvait d'avoir ce cœur, et voilà qu'on le lui aplatissait ! Non, elle trouvait ça trop fort, ça finirait à la fin !","Ah! yes, for example, the desire came to him! That is to say, it itched all over his body to run off and pass by, as old Coupeau used to say. He made her live too much in that idea, an honest girl would have been fired up by it. Even, with his way of yelling, he taught her things she didn't know yet, which was quite surprising. So, little by little, she took on funny ways. One morning he saw her rummaging through some paper to stick something on her little face. It was rice powder, with which she plastered the delicate satin of her skin with a perverse taste. He smeared her with the paper until it scratched her face, calling her a miller's daughter. Another time she brought back some red ribbons to patch up her cap, that old black hat that made her so ashamed. And he asked her furiously where these ribbons came from. Eh ? it was on the back that she had won that! Or had she bought them at the rat race? Slut or thief, perhaps, already both. On several occasions, he thus saw nice objects in her hands, a carnelian ring, a pair of sleeves with a little lace, one of those doubled hearts, ""Tâtez-y"", which girls put between their two nenais. Coupeau wanted to crush everything; but she defended her business with rage, it was hers, ladies had given it to her, or else she had traded in the workshop. For example, the heart, she had found in rue d'Aboukir. When her father crushed her heart with a kick, she remained erect, white and tense, while an inner revolt pushed her to throw herself on him, to snatch something from him. For two years, she had dreamed of having this heart, and now it was being flattened! No, she thought it was too strong, it would end in the end!","Let her be! Don't you see that you are putting all sorts of things into her head?"" And it was quite true; he had put ideas into her head and had taught her some things she did not know before, which was very astonishing. One morning he saw her with something in a paper. It was poudre de riz, which, with a most perverted taste, she was plastering upon her delicate skin. He rubbed the whole of the powder into her hair until she looked like a miller's daughter. Another time she came in with red ribbons to retrim her old hat; he asked her furiously where she got them. Whenever he saw her with a bit of finery her father flew at her with insulting suspicion and angry violence. She defended herself and her small possessions with equal violence. One day he snatched from her a little cornelian heart and ground it to dust under his heel. She stood looking on, white and stern; for two years she had longed for this heart. She said to herself that she would not bear such treatment long.","Ah! yes, indeed, she did wish to do it. She itched all over, longing to break loose and gad all the time, as father Coupeau said. He insisted so much on the subject that even an honest girl would have fired up. Even when he was abusing her, he taught her a few things she did not know as yet, which, to say the least was astonishing. Then, little by little she acquired some singular habits. One morning he noticed her rummaging in a paper bag and rubbing something on her face. It was rice powder, which she plastered on her delicate satin-like skin with perverse taste. He caught up the paper bag and rubbed it over her face violently enough to graze her skin and called her a miller’s daughter. On another occasion she brought some ribbon home, to do up her old black hat which she was so ashamed of. He asked her in a furious voice where she had got those ribbons from. Had she earned them by lying on her back or had she bagged them somewhere? A hussy or a thief, and perhaps both by now? More than once he found her with some pretty little doodad. She had found a little interlaced heart in the street on Rue d’Aboukir. Her father crushed the heart under his foot, driving her to the verge of throwing herself at him to ruin something of his. For two years she had been longing for one of those hearts, and now he had smashed it! This was too much, she was reaching the end of the line with him."
"Non, jamais on n'a vu un homme se rouler comme ça dans le sucre. Lantier avait joliment choisi son affaire en conseillant à Virginie un commerce de friandises. Il était trop provençal pour ne pas adorer les douceurs ; c'est-à-dire qu'il aurait vécu de pastilles, de boules de gomme, de dragées et de chocolat. Les dragées surtout, qu'il appelait des « amandes sucrées », lui mettaient une petite mousse aux lèvres, tant elles lui chatouillaient la gargamelle. Depuis un an, il ne vivait plus que de bonbons. Il ouvrait les tiroirs, se fichait des culottes tout seul, quand Virginie le priait de garder la boutique. Souvent, en causant, devant des cinq ou six personnes, il ôtait le couvercle d'un bocal du comptoir, plongeait la main, croquait quelque chose ; le bocal restait ouvert et se vidait. On ne faisait plus attention à ça, une manie, disait-il. Puis, il avait imaginé un rhume perpétuel, une irritation de la gorge, qu'il parlait d'adoucir. Il ne travaillait toujours pas, avait en vue des affaires de plus en plus considérables ; pour lors, il mijotait une invention superbe, le chapeau-parapluie, un chapeau qui se transformait sur la tête en riflard, aux premières gouttes d'une averse ; et il promettait à Poisson une moitié des bénéfices, il lui empruntait même des pièces de vingt francs, pour les expériences. En attendant, la boutique fondait sur sa langue ; toutes les marchandises y passaient, jusqu'aux cigares en chocolat et aux pipes de caramel rouge. Quand il crevait de sucreries, et que, pris de tendresse, il se payait une dernière lichade sur la patronne, dans un coin, celle-ci le trouvait tout sucré, les lèvres comme des pralines. Un homme joliment gentil à embrasser ! Positivement, il devenait tout miel. Les Boche disaient qu'il lui suffisait de tremper son doigt dans son café, pour en faire un vrai sirop.","No, we've never seen a man roll like that in sugar. Lantier had chosen his business nicely by recommending a candy store to Virginie. He was too Provençal not to adore sweets; that is to say, he would have lived on lozenges, balls of gum, dragees and chocolate. The dragees especially, which he called ""sweetened almonds"", put a little foam on his lips, so much did they tickle his gargamelle. For a year, he lived only on sweets. He opened the drawers, didn't care about the panties all by himself, when Virginie begged him to watch the shop. Often, while chatting, in front of five or six people, he would take the lid off a jar on the counter, put his hand in, bite into something; the jar remained open and emptied. We no longer paid attention to that, a mania, he said. Then he had imagined a perpetual cold, an irritation of the throat, which he spoke of alleviating. He was still not working, had more and more important business in view; for the time being, he was cooking up a superb invention, the umbrella hat, a hat that was transformed on the head into a riffraff, at the first drops of a downpour; and he promised Poisson half of the profits, he even borrowed twenty-franc pieces from him for the experiments. In the meantime, the shop melted on his tongue; all merchandise passed through it, even chocolate cigars and red caramel pipes. When he was bursting with sweets, and when, seized with tenderness, he indulged himself in a last lick on the landlady, in a corner, she found him all sweet, his lips like pralines. A pretty nice man to kiss! Positively, it became all honey. The Boche said that all he had to do was dip his finger in his coffee to make a real syrup.","Lantier had done wisely, so far as he was concerned, in counseling Virginie to open the kind of shop she had. He adored sweets and could have lived on pralines and gumdrops, sugarplums and chocolate. Sugared almonds were his especial delight. For a year his principal food was bonbons. He opened all the jars, boxes and drawers when he was left alone in the shop; and often, with five or six persons standing around, he would take off the cover of a jar on the counter and put in his hand and crunch down an almond. The cover was not put on again, and the jar was soon empty. It was a habit of his, they all said; besides, he was subject to a tickling in his throat! He talked a great deal to Poisson of an invention of his which was worth a fortune—an umbrella and hat in one; that is to say, a hat which, at the first drops of a shower, would expand into an umbrella. Lantier suggested to Virginie that she should have Gervaise come in once each week to wash the floors, shop and the rooms. This she did and received thirty sous each time. Gervaise appeared on Saturday mornings with her bucket and brush, without seeming to suffer a single pang at doing this menial work in the house where she had lived as mistress.","He was too much of a Provincial not to adore sugared things; and in fact he would have lived off sugar candy, lozenges, pastilles, sugar plums and chocolate. Sugared almonds especially left a little froth on his lips so keenly did they tickle his palate. For a year he had been living only on sweetmeats. He opened the drawers and stuffed himself whenever Virginie asked him to mind the shop. Often, when he was talking in the presence of five or six other people, he would take the lid off a jar on the counter, dip his hand into it and begin to nibble at something sweet; the glass jar remained open and its contents diminished. People ceased paying attention to it, it was a mania of his so he had declared. Besides, he had devised a perpetual cold, an irritation of the throat, which he always talked of calming. He still did not work, for he had more and more important schemes than ever in view. He was contriving a superb invention—the umbrella hat, a hat which transformed itself into an umbrella on your head as soon as a shower commenced to fall; and he promised Poisson half shares in the profit of it, and even borrowed twenty franc pieces of him to defray the cost of experiments. Meanwhile the shop melted away on his tongue. All the stock-in-trade followed suit down to the chocolate cigars and pipes in pink caramel. Whenever he was stuffed with sweetmeats and seized with a fit of tenderness, he paid himself with a last lick on the groceress in a corner, who found him all sugar with lips which tasted like burnt almonds. Such a delightful man to kiss! He was positively becoming all honey. The Boches said he merely had to dip a finger into his coffee to sweeten it."
"- Elle ne s'est pas engraissée à lécher les murs, celle-là ! dit Boche.","- She didn't get fat licking the walls, that one! Boche said.","Gervaise left the table to reappear presently, bearing the goose in triumph.","“That one didn’t get fat by licking the walls, I’ll bet!” said Boche."
"- Tu m'embêtes ! fiche-lui une claque ! répondit Gervaise, en train de se bourrer de petits pois.","- You annoy me ! give him a slap! replied Gervaise, stuffing herself with peas.",In the next room at the children's table Nana was playing the mistress of the household.,"“Don’t bother me! give her a slap!” replied Gervaise, in the act of stuffing herself with green peas."
"C'était surtout pour Coupeau que Gervaise se montrait gentille. Jamais une mauvaise parole, jamais une plainte, derrière le dos de son mari. Le zingueur avait fini par se remettre au travail ; et, comme son chantier était alors à l'autre bout de Paris, elle lui donnait tous les matins quarante sous pour son déjeuner, sa goutte et son tabac. Seulement, deux jours sur six, Coupeau s'arrêtait en route, buvait les quarante sous avec un ami, et revenait déjeuner en racontant une histoire. Une fois même, il n'était pas allé loin, il s'était payé avec Mes-Bottes et trois autres un gueuleton soigné, des escargots, du rôti et du vin cacheté, au Capucin, barrière de la Chapelle ; puis, comme ses quarante sous ne suffisaient pas, il avait envoyé la note à sa femme par un garçon, en lui faisant dire qu'il était au clou. Celle-ci riait, haussait les épaules. Où était le mal, si son homme s'amusait un peu ? Il fallait laisser aux hommes la corde longue, quand on voulait vivre en paix dans son ménage. D'un mot à un autre, on en arrivait vite aux coups. Mon Dieu ! on devait tout comprendre, Coupeau souffrait encore de sa jambe, puis il se trouvait entraîné, il était bien forcé de faire comme les autres, sous peine de passer pour un mufle. D'ailleurs, ça ne tirait pas à conséquence ; s'il rentrait éméché, il se couchait, et deux heures après il n'y paraissait plus.","It was especially for Coupeau that Gervaise showed herself kind. Never a bad word, never a complaint, behind her husband's back. The zinc worker had ended up getting back to work; and, as her yard was then at the other end of Paris, she gave him forty sous every morning for his breakfast, his gout, and his tobacco. Only, two days out of six, Coupeau stopped on the way, drank the forty sous with a friend, and came back to lunch telling a story. Once even, he hadn't gone far, he had treated himself with My Boots and three others to a well-prepared meal, snails, roast meat and sealed wine, at the Capucin, Barrière de la Chapelle; then, as his forty sous were not enough, he had sent the note to his wife by a waiter, telling her that he was on the nail. She laughed, shrugged her shoulders. What was the harm if her man had a little fun? You had to leave the long rope to the men, when you wanted to live in peace in your household. From one word to another, it quickly came to blows. My God ! we had to understand everything, Coupeau was still suffering from his leg, then he was carried away, he was forced to do like the others, on pain of being taken for a muzzle. Besides, it was of no consequence; if he came home tipsy, he went to bed, and two hours later he was no longer there.",""" It was to Coupeau himself that Gervaise was especially sweet. Never a cross or an impatient word had he heard from her lips, and no one had ever known her complain of him behind his back. He had finally resumed his trade, and as the shop where he worked was at the other end of Paris, she gave him every morning forty sous for his breakfast, his wine and tobacco. Two days out of six, however, Coupeau would meet a friend, drink up his forty sous and return to breakfast. Once, indeed, he sent a note, saying that his account at the cabaret exceeded his forty sous. He was in pledge, as it were; would his wife send the money? She laughed and shrugged her shoulders. Where was the harm in her husband's amusing himself a little? A woman must give a man a long rope if she wished to live in peace and comfort. It was not far from words to blows—she knew that very well.","It was to Coupeau especially that Gervaise behaved nicely. Never an angry word, never a complaint behind her husband’s back. The zinc-worker had at length resumed work; and as the job he was engaged on was at the other side of Paris , she gave him every morning forty sous for his luncheon, his glass of wine and his tobacco. Only, two days out of every six, Coupeau would stop on the way, spend the forty sous in drink with a friend, and return home to lunch, with some cock-and-bull story. Once even he did not take the trouble to go far; he treated himself, My-Boots and three others to a regular feast—snails, roast meat, and some sealed bottles of wine—at the “Capuchin,” on the Barriere de la Chapelle. Then, as his forty sous were not sufficient, he had sent the waiter to his wife with the bill and the information that he was in pawn. She laughed and shrugged her shoulders. Where was the harm if her old man amused himself a bit? You must give men a long rein if you want to live peaceably at home. From one word to another, one soon arrived at blows. Mon Dieu! It was easy to understand. Coupeau still suffered from his leg; besides, he was led astray. He was obliged to do as the others did, or else he would be thought a cheap skate. And it was really a matter of no consequence. If he came home a bit elevated, he went to bed, and two hours afterwards he was all right again."
"La grande Clémence mettait à neuf une chemise d'homme, dont elle détachait les plis du bout de l'ongle. Elle avait un rhume à crever, les yeux enflés, la gorge arrachée par des quintes de toux qui la pliaient en deux, au bord de l'établi. Avec ça, elle ne portait pas même un foulard au cou, vêtue d'un petit lainage à dix-huit sous, dans lequel elle grelottait. Près d'elle, madame Putois, enveloppée de flanelle, matelassée jusqu'aux oreilles, repassait un jupon, qu'elle tournait autour de la planche à robe, dont le petit bout était posé sur le dossier d'une chaise ; et, par terre, un drap jeté empêchait le jupon de se salir, en frôlant le carreau. Gervaise occupait à elle seule la moitié de l'établi, avec des rideaux de mousseline brodée, sur lesquels elle poussait son fer tout droit, les bras allongés, pour éviter les faux plis. Tout d'un coup, le café qui se mit à couler bruyamment lui fit lever la tête. C'était ce louchon d'Augustine qui venait de pratiquer un trou au milieu du marc, en enfonçant une cuiller dans le filtre.","Tall Clemence was putting on a new man's shirt, from which she undid the folds with the tip of her fingernail. She had a cold to die for, her eyes swollen, her throat torn by fits of coughing which bent her over at the edge of the workbench. Besides, she wasn't even wearing a scarf around her neck, dressed in a little eighteen-sou woolen jacket, in which she was shivering. Beside her, Madame Putois, wrapped in flannel, padded up to the ears, was ironing a petticoat, which she twisted around the dress board, the small end of which rested on the back of a chair; and, on the floor, a thrown sheet prevented the petticoat from getting dirty, brushing against the tile. Gervaise occupied half of the workbench alone, with embroidered muslin curtains, over which she pushed her iron straight, her arms outstretched, to avoid creases. Suddenly, the coffee that began to flow noisily made him raise his head. It was that sleazy Augustine who had just made a hole in the middle of the marc by sticking a spoon into the filter.","Clémence, with a frightful cold, was, as usual, at work on a man's shirt. Mme Putois was ironing a skirt on a board, with a cloth laid on the floor to prevent the skirt from being soiled. Mamma Coupeau brought in the coffee, and as each one of the women took a cup with a sigh of enjoyment the street door opened and Virginie came in with a rush of cold air.","Tall Clemence was working on a man’s shirt, the plaits of which she separated with her finger-nail. She had caught a cold, her eyes were frightfully swollen and her chest was shaken with fits of coughing, which doubled her up beside the work-table. With all that she had not even a handkerchief round her neck and she was dressed in some cheap flimsy woolen stuff in which she shivered. Close by, Madame Putois, wrapped up in flannel muffled up to her ears, was ironing a petticoat which she turned round the skirt-board, the narrow end of which rested on the back of a chair; whilst a sheet laid on the floor prevented the petticoat from getting dirty as it trailed along the tiles. Gervaise alone occupied half the work-table with some embroidered muslin curtains, over which she passed her iron in a straight line with her arms stretched out to avoid making any creases. All on a sudden the coffee running through noisily caused her to raise her head. It was that squint-eyed Augustine who had just given it an outlet by thrusting a spoon through the strainer."
"Bazouge, toujours galant, pensa qu'il ne devait pas bousculer une dame, qui semblait avoir un tel béguin pour lui. Elle déménageait, mais elle avait tout de même de beaux restes, quand elle se montait.","Bazouge, always gallant, thought he shouldn't rush a lady, who seemed to have such a crush on him. She moved, but she still had beautiful leftovers, when she went up.","I have buried three women today, who would each have given me a jolly little sum out of gratitude, if they could have put their hands in their pockets.","Bazouge, ever gallant, thought that he ought not to be hasty with a lady who appeared to have taken such a fancy to him. She was falling to pieces, but all the same, what remained was very fine, especially when she was excited."
"- On ne veut plus de moi nulle part pour travailler, murmura-t-il. Je suis trop vieux. Quand j'entre dans un atelier, les jeunes rigolent et me demandent si c'est moi qui ai verni les bottes d'Henri IV ? L'année dernière, j'ai encore gagné trente sous par jour à peindre un pont ; il fallait rester sur le dos, avec la rivière qui coulait en bas. Je tousse depuis ce temps ? Aujourd'hui, c'est fini, on m'a mis à la porte de partout.","- They don't want me anywhere to work anymore, he whispered. I am too old. When I enter a workshop, young people laugh and ask me if it was I who varnished Henri IV's boots?

Today, it's over, I've been thrown out of everywhere.","""I can't get any work to do. I am too old. When I ask for any people laugh and ask if it was I who blacked Henri Quatre's boots.

I had to lie on my back all the time, close to the water, and since then I have coughed incessantly.""","“I can’t get work anywhere,” murmured he. “I’m too old. When I enter a workshop the young fellows joke, and ask me if I polished Henri IV. ’s boots. To-day it’s all over; they won’t have me anywhere. Last year I could still earn thirty sous a day painting a bridge. I had to lie on my back with the river flowing under me. I’ve had a bad cough ever since then. Now, I’m finished.”"
"- Comment ! c'est ce que vous apportez ?.. Il manque deux paires de bas, six serviettes, une nappe, des torchons ? Vous vous moquez de moi, alors ! Je vous ai fait dire de tout me rendre, repassé ou non.

Two pairs of stockings, six towels, a tablecloth, tea towels are missing? Are you kidding me then! I told you to return everything to me, ironed or not. If your apprentice isn't here with the rest in an hour, we'll get angry, Madame Coupeau, I warn you.","Then she exclaimed: ""Two pairs of stockings, six towels and one napkin are missing from this week. You are laughing at me, it seems. Now, just understand, I tell you to bring back all you have, ironed or not ironed. If in an hour your woman is not here with the rest I have done with you, Madame Coupeau!""","“What! This is all you’ve brought? There are two pairs of stockings, six towels, a table-cloth, and several dish-cloths short. You’re regularly trifling with me, it seems! I sent word that you were to bring me everything, ironed or not. If your apprentice isn’t here on the hour with the rest of the things, we shall fall out, Madame Coupeau, I warn you.”"
"Cependant, M. Madinier avait pris une assiette. Les demoiselles et les dames seules, madame Lerat, madame Fauconnier, mademoiselle Remanjou, déposèrent leur pièce de cent sous les premières, discrètement. Ensuite, les messieurs s'isolèrent à l'autre bout de la salle, firent les comptes. On était quinze ; ça montait donc à soixante-quinze francs. Lorsque les soixante-quinze francs furent dans l'assiette, chaque homme ajouta cinq sous pour les garçons. Il fallut un quart d'heure de calculs laborieux, avant de tout régler à la satisfaction de chacun.","However, M. Madinier had taken a plate. The young ladies and ladies alone, Madame Lerat, Madame Fauconnier, Mademoiselle Remanjou, discreetly put down their five-franc piece first. Then the gentlemen isolated themselves at the other end of the room, did the accounts. We were fifteen; it therefore amounted to seventy-five francs. When the seventy-five francs were on the plate, each man added five sous for the boys. It took a quarter of an hour of laborious calculations before everything was settled to everyone's satisfaction.","M. Madinier had taken a plate. The ladies each laid down their five francs quietly and timidly, and then the men retreated to the other end of the room and counted up the amount, and each man added to his subscription five sous for the garçon.","Monsieur Madinier went round with a plate. The spinster and the ladies who were alone—Madame Lerat, Madame Fauconnier, Mademoiselle Remanjou—discreetly placed their five-franc pieces in it first.

"- Mais non, monsieur Coupeau, répondit-elle en tâchant de sourire.","""No, Monsieur Coupeau,"" she answered, trying to smile.","""No, Monsieur Coupeau,"" she answered, trying to smile.","“Why, no, Monsieur Coupeau,” she replied, trying to smile."
"Dans les premiers temps, tout fut en l'air chez la blanchisseuse. Lantier avait bien sa chambre séparée, son entrée, sa clef ; mais, comme au dernier moment, on s'était décidé à ne pas condamner la porte de communication, il arrivait que, le plus souvent, il passait par la boutique. Le linge sale aussi embarrassait beaucoup Gervaise, car son mari ne s'occupait pas de la grande caisse dont il avait parlé ; et elle se trouvait réduite à fourrer le linge un peu partout, dans les coins, principalement sous son lit, ce qui manquait d'agrément pendant les nuits d'été. Enfin, elle était très ennuyée d'avoir chaque soir à faire le lit d'Etienne au beau milieu de la boutique ; lorsque les ouvrières veillaient, l'enfant dormait sur une chaise, en attendant. Aussi Goujet lui ayant parlé d'envoyer Etienne à Lille, où son ancien patron, un mécanicien, demandait des apprentis, elle fut séduite par ce projet, d'autant plus que le gamin, peu heureux à la maison, désireux d'être son maître, la suppliait de consentir. Seulement, elle craignait un refus net de la part de Lantier. Il était venu habiter chez eux, uniquement pour se rapprocher de son fils ; il n'allait pas vouloir le perdre juste quinze jours après son installation. Pourtant, quand elle lui parla en tremblant de l'affaire, il approuva beaucoup l'idée, disant que les jeunes ouvriers ont besoin de voir du pays. Le matin où Etienne partit, il lui fit un discours sur ses droits, puis il l'embrassa, il déclama :","At first, everything was up in the air at the laundress's. Lantier had his separate bedroom, his entrance, his key; but, as at the last moment, they had decided not to block off the connecting door, it happened that, more often than not, he would pass through the shop. The dirty laundry also embarrassed Gervaise a great deal, for her husband did not bother about the big box he had mentioned; and she was reduced to stuffing the laundry all over the place, in the corners, mainly under her bed, which was unpleasant during summer nights. Finally, she was very annoyed at having to make Etienne's bed every evening right in the middle of the shop; when the workers were awake, the child slept on a chair, waiting. So Goujet having talked to her about sending Etienne to Lille, where his former boss, a mechanic, was asking for apprentices, she was seduced by this project, especially since the boy, unhappy at home, eager to be his master, begged her to consent. Only, she feared a definite refusal on the part of Lantier. He had come to live with them, only to be closer to his son; he wasn't going to want to lose it just a fortnight after it was installed. However, when she tremblingly told him about the affair, he very much approved of the idea, saying that young workers need to see the country. The morning Etienne left, he made a speech to her about her rights, then he kissed her, he declaimed:","From the very first Lantier was made thoroughly at home. Lantier had his separate room, private entrance and key. But he went through the shop almost always. The accumulation of linen disturbed Gervaise, for her husband never arranged the boxes he had promised, and she was obliged to stow it away in all sorts of places, under the bed and in the corner. She did not like making up Etienne's mattress late at night either. Goujet had spoken of sending the child to Lille to his own old master, who wanted apprentices. The plan pleased her, particularly as the boy, who was not very happy at home, was impatient to become his own master. But she dared not ask Lantier, who had come there to live ostensibly to be near his son. She felt, therefore, that it was hardly a good plan to send the boy away within a couple of weeks after his father's arrival. When, however, she did make up her mind to approach the subject he expressed warm approval of the idea, saying that youths were far better in the country than in Paris. Finally it was decided that Etienne should go, and when the morning of his departure arrived Lantier read his son a long lecture and then sent him off, and the house settled down into new habits.","At the beginning of the new arrangement, the entire routine of the establishment was considerably upset. Lantier had his own separate room, with his own entrance and his own key. However, since they had decided not to close off the door between the rooms, he usually came and went through the shop. Besides, the dirty clothes were an inconvenience to Gervaise because her husband never made the case he had promised and she had to tuck the dirty laundry into any odd corner she could find. They usually ended up under the bed and this was not very pleasant on warm summer nights. She also found it a nuisance having to make up Etienne’s bed every evening in the shop. When her employees worked late, the lad had to sleep in a chair until they finished. Goujet had mentioned sending Etienne to Lille where a machinist he knew was looking for apprentices. As the boy was unhappy at home and eager to be out on his own, Gervaise seriously considered the proposal. Her only fear was that Lantier would refuse. Since he had come to live with them solely to be near his son, surely he wouldn’t want to lose him only two weeks after he moved in. However he approved whole-heartedly when she timidly broached the matter to him. He said that young men needed to see a bit of the country. The morning that Etienne left Lantier made a speech to him, kissed him and ended by saying:"
"Gervaise pourtant monta un jour chez les Lorilleux. Il s'agissait de maman Coupeau, qui avait alors soixante-sept ans. Les yeux de maman Coupeau étaient complètement perdus. Ses jambes non plus n'allaient pas du tout. Elle venait de renoncer à son dernier ménage par force, et menaçait de crever de faim, si on ne la secourait pas. Gervaise trouvait honteux qu'une femme de cet âge, ayant trois enfants, fût ainsi abandonnée du ciel et de la terre. Et comme Coupeau refusait de parler aux Lorilleux, en disant à Gervaise qu'elle pouvait bien monter, elle, celle-ci monta sous le coup d'une indignation, dont tout son cœur était gonflé. En haut, elle entra sans frapper, comme une tempête. Rien n'était changé depuis le soir où les Lorilleux, pour la première fois, lui avaient fait un accueil si peu engageant. Le même lambeau de laine déteinte séparait la chambre de l'atelier, un logement en coup de fusil qui semblait bâti pour une anguille. Au fond, Lorilleux, penché sur son établi, pinçait un à un les maillons d'un bout de colonne, tandis que madame Lorilleux tirait un fil d'or à la filière, debout devant l'étau. La petite forge, sous le plein jour, avait un reflet rose.","Gervaise, however, went up one day to the Lorilleux. It was mother Coupeau, who was then sixty-seven years old. Mama Coupeau's eyes were completely lost. His legs weren't going at all either. She had just given up her last household by force, and threatened to starve to death if they did not help her. Gervaise found it shameful that a woman of that age, with three children, should be thus abandoned by heaven and earth. And as Coupeau refused to speak to the Lorilleuxs, telling Gervaise that she could go upstairs, she went upstairs in a fit of indignation with which her whole heart was swollen. Upstairs, she entered without knocking, like a storm. Nothing had changed since the evening when the Lorilleuxs, for the first time, had given him such an uninviting welcome. The same shred of faded wool separated the bedroom from the studio, a gunshot dwelling that seemed built for an eel. In the background, Lorilleux, leaning over his workbench, was pinching the links of the end of the column one by one, while Madame Lorilleux was pulling a gold thread from the spinneret, standing in front of the vice. The small forge, in broad daylight, shone pink.","There came a day, however, when Gervaise found it necessary to call on the Lorilleuxs. It was on Mamma Coupeau's account, who was sixty-seven years old, nearly blind and helpless. They must all unite in doing something for her now. Gervaise thought it a burning shame that a woman of her age, with three well-to-do children, should be allowed for a moment to regard herself as friendless and forsaken. And as her husband refused to speak to his sister, Gervaise said she would. She entered the room like a whirlwind, without knocking. Everything was just as it was on that night when she had been received by them in a fashion which she had never forgotten or forgiven. ""I have come,"" cried Gervaise, ""and I dare say you wish to know why, particularly as we are at daggers drawn.","One day, Gervaise went up to see the Lorilleuxs in spite of this. It was with respect to mother Coupeau who was then sixty-seven years old. Mother Coupeau’s eyesight was almost completely gone. Her legs too were no longer what they used to be. She had been obliged to give up her last cleaning job and now threatened to die of hunger if assistance were not forthcoming. Gervaise thought it shameful that a woman of her age, having three children should be thus abandoned by heaven and earth. And as Coupeau refused to speak to the Lorilleuxs on the subject saying that she, Gervaise, could very well go and do so, the latter went up in a fit of indignation with which her heart was almost bursting. When she reached their door she entered without knocking. Nothing had been changed since the night when the Lorilleuxs, at their first meeting had received her so ungraciously. The same strip of faded woolen stuff separated the room from the workshop, a lodging like a gun barrel, and which looked as though it had been built for an eel. Right at the back Lorilleux, leaning over his bench, was squeezing together one by one the links of a piece of chain, whilst Madame Lorilleux, standing in front of the vise was passing a gold wire through the draw-plate. In the broad daylight the little forge had a rosy reflection."
"- Tu sais ? écoute bien ? c'est moi, Bibi-la-Gaieté, dit le consolateur des dames ? Va, t'es heureuse. Fais dodo, ma belle !","- You know ? listen carefully ? Is it I, Bibi-la-Gaieté, said the ladies' consoler? Come on, you're happy. Sleep, my beauty!","And as he laid her gently in her coffin he murmured between two hiccups: ""It is I—my dear, it is I,"" said this rough consoler of women. ""It is I. Be happy now and sleep quietly, my dear!""","Then, as he laid her out with paternal care at the bottom of the coffin, he stuttered between two hiccoughs: “You know—now listen—it’s me, Bibi-the-Gay, called the ladies’ consoler. There, you’re happy now. Go by-by, my beauty!”"
"- Mon Dieu ! je ne suis pas ambitieuse, je ne demande pas grand-chose ? Mon idéal, ce serait de travailler tranquille, de manger toujours du pain, d'avoir un trou un peu propre pour dormir, vous savez, un lit, une table et deux chaises, pas davantage ? Ah ! je voudrais aussi élever mes enfants, en faire de bons sujets, si c'était possible ? Il y a encore un idéal, ce serait de ne pas être battue, si je me remettais jamais en ménage ; non, ça ne me plairait pas d'être battue ? Et c'est tout, vous voyez, c'est tout ?","- My God ! I'm not ambitious, I'm not asking for much? My ideal would be to work quietly, to always eat bread, to have a somewhat clean hole to sleep in, you know, a bed, a table and two chairs, no more? Ah! I would also like to raise my children, to make good subjects of them, if that were possible? There is still an ideal, it would be not to be beaten, if I ever got back together; no, I wouldn't like to be beaten? And that's it, you see, that's it?","""Heaven knows I am not ambitious. I do not ask for much in this world. My idea would be to live a quiet life and always have enough to eat—a clean place to live in—with a comfortable bed, a table and a chair or two. Yes, I would like to bring my children up in that way and see them good and industrious. I should not like to run the risk of being beaten—no, that would not please me at all!"" She hesitated, as if to find something else to say, and then resumed:","“Mon Dieu! I’m not ambitious; I don’t ask for much. My desire is to work in peace, always to have bread to eat and a decent place to sleep in, you know; with a bed, a table, and two chairs, nothing more. If I can, I’d like to raise my children to be good citizens. Also, I’d like not to be beaten up, if I ever again live with a man. It’s not my idea of amusement.”"
"- Encore un peu à droite. Maintenant, faites bien attention à la boiserie ? Vous savez, je n'ai pas été très contente, samedi dernier. Les taches étaient restées.","- A little more to the right. Now, pay attention to the woodwork? You know, I wasn't very happy last Saturday. The stains remained.","""A little more to the right. Remember, those spots must all be taken out. Last Saturday, you know, I was not pleased."" And then Lantier and Virginie fell into a conversation, while Gervaise crawled along the floor in the dirt at their feet.",“A little more on the right there. Take care of the wainscot. You know I was not very well pleased last Saturday. There were some stains left.”
"Le quartier trouvait Gervaise bien gentille. Sans doute, on clabaudait sur son compte, mais il n'y avait qu'une voix pour lui reconnaître de grands yeux, une bouche pas plus longue que ça, avec des dents très blanches. Enfin, c'était une jolie blonde, et elle aurait pu se mettre parmi les plus belles, sans le malheur de sa jambe. Elle était dans ses vingt-huit ans, elle avait engraissé. Ses traits fins s'empâtaient, ses gestes prenaient une lenteur heureuse. Maintenant, elle s'oubliait parfois sur le bord d'une chaise, le temps d'attendre son fer, avec un sourire vague, la face noyée d'une joie gourmande. Elle devenait gourmande ; ça, tout le monde le disait ; mais ce n'était pas un vilain défaut, au contraire. Quand on gagne de quoi se payer de fins morceaux, n'est-ce pas ? on serait bien bête de manger des pelures de pommes de terre. D'autant plus qu'elle travaillait toujours dur, se mettant en quatre pour ses pratiques, passant elle-même les nuits, les volets fermés, lorsque la besogne était pressée. Comme on disait dans le quartier, elle avait la veine ; tout lui prospérait. Elle blanchissait la maison, M. Madinier, mademoiselle Remanjou, les Boche ; elle enlevait même à son ancienne patronne, madame Fauconnier, des dames de Paris logées rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière. Dès la seconde quinzaine, elle avait dû prendre deux ouvrières, madame Putois et la grande Clémence, cette fille qui habitait autrefois au sixième ; ça lui faisait trois personnes chez elle, avec son apprentie, ce petit louchon d'Augustine, laide comme un derrière de pauvre homme. D'autres auraient pour sûr perdu la tête dans ce coup de fortune. Elle était bien pardonnable de fricoter un peu le lundi, après avoir trimé la semaine entière. D'ailleurs, il lui fallait ça ; elle serait restée gnangnan, à regarder les chemises se repasser toutes seules, si elle ne s'était pas collé un velours sur la poitrine, quelque chose de bon dont l'envie lui chatouillait le jabot.","The neighborhood found Gervaise very nice. No doubt people chattered about him, but there was only one voice to recognize his big eyes, a mouth no longer than that, with very white teeth. Anyway, she was a pretty blonde, and she could have placed herself among the most beautiful, had it not been for the misfortune of her leg. She was in her twenty-eight years, she had put on weight. His fine features thickened, his gestures took on a happy slowness. Now she sometimes forgot herself on the edge of a chair, the time to wait for her iron, with a vague smile, her face drowned in greedy joy. She was becoming greedy; that, everyone said; but it was not a bad fault, on the contrary. When you earn enough to pay for fine pieces, right? it would be very stupid to eat potato peels. Especially since she always worked hard, going out of her way for her practices, spending the nights herself, with the shutters closed, when the job was in a hurry. As they said in the neighborhood, she was lucky; everything prospered for him. She whitewashed the house, M. Madinier, Mademoiselle Remanjou, the Boches; she even took away from her former patroness, Madame Fauconnier, ladies from Paris living in the rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere. In the second fortnight she had had to take on two workers, Madame Putois and tall Clemence, that girl who used to live on the sixth floor; That made her three people at home, with her apprentice, that shady little Augustine, ugly as a poor man's behind. Others would surely have lost their minds in this stroke of luck. She was forgivable for messing around a little on Monday, after having toiled away the whole week. Besides, he needed that; she would have remained dimwitted, watching the shirts iron themselves, if she hadn't slapped a velvet on her chest, something good the desire for which tickled her crop.","All the people in the neighborhood liked her and would have called her a great beauty but for her lameness. She was twenty-eight and had grown plump. She moved more slowly, and when she took a chair to wait for her irons to heat she rose with reluctance. She was growing fond of good living—that she herself admitted—but she did not regard it as a fault. She worked hard and had a right to good food. Why should she live on potato parings? Sometimes she worked all night when she had a great deal of work on hand. She did the washing for the whole house and for some Parisian ladies and had several apprentices, besides two laundresses. She was making money hand over fist, and her good luck would have turned a wiser head than her own. But hers was not turned; she was gentle and sweet and hated no one except her sister-in-law.","The neighborhood in general thought Gervaise very nice. There was , it is true, a good deal of scandal related regarding her; but everyone admired her large eyes, small mouth and beautiful white teeth. In short she was a pretty blonde, and had it not been for her crippled leg she might have ranked amongst the comeliest. She was now in her twenty-eighth year, and had grown considerably plumper. Her fine features were becoming puffy, and her gestures were assuming a pleasant indolence. At times she occasionally seemed to forget herself on the edge of a chair, whilst she waited for her iron to heat, smiling vaguely and with an expression of greedy joy upon her face. She was becoming fond of good living, everybody said so; but that was not a very grave fault, but rather the contrary. When one earns sufficient to be able to buy good food, one would be foolish to eat potato parings. All the more so as she continued to work very hard, slaving to please her customers, sitting up late at night after the place was closed, whenever there was anything urgent. She was lucky as all her neighbors said; everything prospered with her. She did the washing for all the house—M. Madinier, Mademoiselle Remanjou, the Boches. She even secured some of the customers of her old employer, Madame Fauconnier, Parisian ladies living in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere. As early as the third week she was obliged to engage two workwomen, Madame Putois and tall Clemence, the girl who used to live on the sixth floor; counting her apprentice, that little squint-eyed Augustine, who was as ugly as a beggar’s behind, that made three persons in her employ. Others would certainly have lost their heads at such a piece of good fortune. It was excusable for her to slack a little on Monday after drudging all through the week. Besides, it was necessary to her. She would have had no courage left, and would have expected to see the shirts iron themselves, if she had not been able to dress up in some pretty thing. Gervaise was always so amiable, meek as a lamb, sweet as sugar."
"- Ah bien ! murmura-t-il, il a une bonne tête ce matin, Badingue ! ? Attention ! il serre trop les fesses, il a dû se faire coller un œil de verre quelque part, pour surprendre son monde.","- Ah well ! he murmured, he has a good head this morning, Badingue! ? Attention ! he squeezes his buttocks too tightly, he must have had a glass eye stuck somewhere, to surprise his people.","There was not another praline for him to crunch, not even a gumdrop.","“Dear me,” he muttered, “Badingue looks fine this morning! Just look, see how stiff he walks. He must have stuck a glass eye in his back to surprise people.”"
"- Ce n'est pas pour dire, murmurait-il, il chelingue rudement, ton linge ! Mais je t'aime tout de même, vois-tu !","- It's not to say, he murmured, he chelinge roughly, your laundry! But I love you all the same, you see!",She pushed him aside with a laugh.,"“It’s not for the sake of saying so,” he murmured; “but your dirty linen stinks tremendously! Still, I love you all the same, you know.”"
"Ce fut madame Lerat qui reparut la première. Elle avait fait le tour par la rue, pour donner plus de pompe à la réconciliation. Elle tint de la main la porte de la boutique grande ouverte, tandis que madame Lorilleux, en robe de soie, s'arrêtait sur le seuil. Tous les invités s'étaient levés, Gervaise s'avança, embrassa sa belle-sœur, comme il était convenu, en disant :","It was Madame Lerat who reappeared first. She had gone round the street, to give more pomp to the reconciliation. She held the door of the shop wide open with her hand, while Madame Lorilleux, in a silk dress, stopped on the threshold. All the guests had risen, Gervaise came forward, kissed her sister-in-law, as agreed, saying:","Mme Lerat presently reappeared. She had come round by the street to give a more ceremonious aspect to the affair. She held the door open while Mme Lorilleux, in a silk dress, stood on the threshold. All the guests rose, and Gervaise went forward to meet her sister and kissed her, as had been agreed upon.","It was Madame Lerat who appeared first.

"Puis, après le dîner, quand la famille n'envahissait pas la chambre, les Goujet venaient tenir compagnie aux Coupeau. Pendant deux heures, jusqu'à dix heures, le forgeron fumait sa pipe, en regardant Gervaise tourner autour du malade. Il ne disait pas dix paroles de la soirée. Sa grande face blonde enfoncée entre ses épaules de colosse, il s'attendrissait à la voir verser de la tisane dans une tasse, remuer le sucre sans faire de bruit avec la cuiller. Lorsqu'elle bordait le lit et qu'elle encourageait Coupeau d'une voix douce, il restait tout secoué. Jamais il n'avait rencontré une aussi brave femme. Ça ne lui allait même pas mal de boiter, car elle en avait plus de mérite encore à se décarcasser tout le long de la journée auprès de son mari. On ne pouvait pas dire, elle ne s'asseyait pas un quart d'heure, le temps de manger. Elle courait sans cesse chez le pharmacien, mettait son nez dans des choses pas propres, se donnait un mal du tonnerre pour tenir en ordre cette chambre où l'on faisait tout ; avec ça, pas une plainte, toujours aimable, même les soirs où elle dormait debout, les yeux ouverts, tant elle était lasse. Et le forgeron, dans cet air de dévouement, au milieu des drogues traînant sur les meubles, se prenait d'une grande affection pour Gervaise, à la regarder ainsi aimer et soigner Coupeau de tout son cœur.","Then, after dinner, when the family was not invading the room, the Goujets came to keep the Coupeaus company. For two hours, until ten o'clock, the blacksmith smoked his pipe, watching Gervaise turn around the patient. He did not say ten words of the evening. His big blond face buried between his colossal shoulders, he was moved to see her pouring herbal tea into a cup, stirring the sugar without making a sound with the spoon. When she tucked the bed in and encouraged Coupeau in a soft voice, he remained quite shaken. He had never met such a brave woman. It didn't even suit her to limp, because she deserved it even more by pushing hard all day long with her husband. You couldn't tell, she didn't sit down for a quarter of an hour, the time to eat. She was constantly running to the chemist's, poking her nose into unclean things, going out of her way to keep this room where everything was done in order; with that, not a complaint, always pleasant, even the evenings when she slept standing up, her eyes open, she was so tired. And the blacksmith, in this air of devotion, amid the drugs lying on the furniture, took a great affection for Gervaise, watching her love and care for Coupeau with all her heart.","Goujet filled her buckets every morning with fresh water, and this was an economy of at least two sous, and in the evening came to sit with Coupeau. He did not say much, but his companionship cheered and comforted the invalid. He was tender and compassionate and was thrilled by the sweetness of Gervaise's voice when she spoke to her husband. Never had he seen such a brave, good woman; he did not believe she sat in her chair fifteen minutes in the whole day. She was never tired, never out of temper, and the young man grew very fond of the poor woman as he watched her.","After dinner, if no family came to visit, the Goujets would come over to visit with the Coupeaus. Until ten o’clock, the blacksmith would smoke his pipe and watch Gervaise busy with her invalid. He would not speak ten words the entire evening. He was moved to pity by the sight of her pouring Coupeau’s tea and medicine into a cup, or stirring the sugar in it very carefully so as to make no sound with the spoon. It stirred him deeply when she would lean over Coupeau and speak in her soft voice. Never before had he known such a fine woman. Her limp increased the credit due her for wearing herself out doing things for her husband all day long. She never sat down for ten minutes, not even to eat. She was always running to the chemist’s. And then she would still keep the house clean, not even a speck of dust. She never complained, no matter how exhausted she became. Goujet developed a very deep affection for Gervaise in this atmosphere of unselfish devotion."
"Un interne, un gros garçon blond et rose, en tablier blanc, tranquillement assis, prenait des notes. Le cas était curieux, l'interne ne quittait pas le malade.","An intern, a fat blond and pink boy, in a white apron, quietly seated, taking notes. The case was curious, the intern did not leave the patient.","A house surgeon, a fair and rosy youth, was sitting, calmly taking notes. The case was a peculiar one and had excited a great deal of attention among the physicians attached to the hospital.","A house surgeon, a big fair fellow with a rosy countenance, and wearing a white apron, was quietly sitting taking notes. The case was a curious one; the doctor did not leave the patient."
"- Bah ! monsieur Coupeau, dit-elle, au bout d'une minute, un petit verre de cric, ce n'est pas mauvais. Moi, ça me donne du chien ? Puis, vous savez, plus vite on est tortillé, plus c'est drôle. Oh ! je ne me monte pas le bourrichon, je sais que je ne ferai pas de vieux os.","- Bah ! Monsieur Coupeau, she said, after a minute, a little glass of jack, it's not bad. Me, it gives me dog? Then, you know, the faster you squirm, the funnier it is. Oh ! I don't get carried away, I know I won't make old bones.","Mme Putois had attacked the basket of linen prepared by Gervaise, and Augustine was ironing her towels, with her nose in the air, deeply interested in a fly that was buzzing about.","“Bah! Monsieur Coupeau,” said she after a minute or two, “a little glass of brandy isn’t bad. It sets me going. Besides, the sooner you’re merry, the jollier it is. Oh! I don’t make any mistake; I know that I shan’t make old bones.”"
"- Ah ! zut ! cria Coupeau, mettons-nous à table. Vous allez le voir abouler ; il a le nez creux, il sent la boustifaille de loin ? Dites donc, il doit rire, s'il est toujours à faire le poireau sur la route de Saint-Denis !","- Oh! Damn ! cried Coupeau, let's sit down to table. You will see him boulder; he has a hollow nose, he smells grub from afar? Hey, he must be laughing if he's still joking around on the road to Saint-Denis!","""We won't wait any longer for Mes-Bottes,"" cried Coupeau. ""We are all here but him, and his scent is good! Surely he can't be waiting for us still at St-Denis!""","“Oh! blow him!” cried Coupeau, “let’s begin. You’ll see, he’ll soon turn up, he’s got a hollow nose, he can scent the grub from afar. I say he must be amusing himself, if he’s still standing like a post on the Route de Saint-Denis!”"
"- Ah ! ah ! dit Lantier, quand il le vit entrer, c'est vous, Badingue !","- Oh! ah! said Lantier, when he saw him enter, ""it's you, Badingue!""","Lantier never saw him without some joke in regard to his political convictions, which, however, had not prevented the men from becoming excellent friends.","“Ah! ah!” said Lantier when he saw him enter, “it’s you, Badingue.”"
- Pardi ! un homme qui lui fait des queues tous les jours !,- Goodbye! a man who queues for her every day!,"""Did you know,"" said Leonie as she picked up a rose leaf with her pincers, ""how wretched poor Caroline is with that fellow who used to call for her regularly every night?""","“Ah!” said Nana, who was cutting thin strips of green paper. “A man who cheats on her every day!”"
"L'aide enfonça les fers à souder au milieu de la braise, d'un rose pâle dans le plein jour. Puis, il se remit à souffler. Coupeau tenait la dernière feuille de zinc. Elle restait à poser au bord du toit, près de la gouttière ; là, il y avait une brusque pente, et le trou béant de la rue se creusait. Le zingueur, comme chez lui, en chaussons de lisières, s'avança, traînant les pieds, sifflotant l'air d'Ohé ! les p'tits agneaux. Arrivé devant le trou, il se laissa couler, s'arc-bouta d'un genou contre la maçonnerie d'une cheminée, resta à moitié chemin du pavé. Une de ses jambes pendait. Quand il se renversait pour appeler cette couleuvre de Zidore, il se rattrapait à un coin de la maçonnerie à cause du trottoir, là-bas, sous lui.","The aide drove the soldering irons into the embers, pale pink in the daylight. Then he started breathing again. Coupeau held the last sheet of zinc. It remained to be placed on the edge of the roof, near the gutter; there, there was a sudden slope, and the gaping hole in the street was hollowed out. The zinc worker, as at home, in slippers, came forward, dragging his feet, whistling the tune of Ohé! the little lambs. Arrived at the hole, he let himself sink, braced himself with one knee against the masonry of a chimney, remained halfway to the pavement. One of his legs was hanging down. When he fell back to call that snake Zidore, he caught himself at a corner of the masonry because of the sidewalk, over there, under him.","The boy thrust the irons among the coals which showed only a dull pink in the sunlight and then went to work again with his bellows. Coupeau took up his last sheet of zinc. It was to be placed on the edge of the roof, near the gutter. Just at that spot the roof was very steep. The man walked along in his list slippers much as if he had been at home, whistling a popular melody. He allowed himself to slip a little and caught at the chimney, calling to Zidore as he did so:","The boy stuck the soldering irons into the midst of the charcoal, which looked a pale rose color in the daylight. Then he resumed blowing. Coupeau held the last sheet of zinc. It had to be placed at the edge of the roof, close to the gutter-pipe; there was an abrupt slant there, and the gaping void of the street opened beneath. The zinc-worker, just as though in his own home, wearing his list-shoes, advanced, dragging his feet, and whistling the air, “Oh! the little lambs.” Arrived in front of the opening, he let himself down, and then, supporting himself with one knee against the masonry of a chimney-stack, remained half-way out over the pavement below. One of his legs dangled. When he leant back to call that young viper, Zidore, he held on to a corner of the masonry, on account of the street beneath him."
"Une seule chose mettait Gervaise hors d'elle. C'était lorsque sa fille reparaissait avec des robes à queue et des chapeaux couverts de plumes. Non, ce luxe-là, elle ne pouvait pas l'avaler. Que Nana fît la noce, si elle voulait ; mais, quand elle venait chez sa mère, qu'elle s'habillât au moins comme une ouvrière doit être habillée. Les robes à queue faisaient une révolution dans la maison : les Lorilleux ricanaient ; Lantier, tout émoustillé, tournait autour de la petite, pour renifler sa bonne odeur ; les Boche avaient défendu à Pauline de fréquenter cette rouchie, avec ses oripeaux. Et Gervaise se fâchait également des sommeils écrasés de Nana, lorsque, après une de ses fugues, elle dormait jusqu'à midi, dépoitraillée, le chignon défait et plein encore d'épingles à cheveux, si blanche, respirant si court, qu'elle semblait morte. Elle la secouait des cinq ou six fois dans la matinée, en la menaçant de lui flanquer sur le ventre une potée d'eau. Cette belle fille fainéante, à moitié nue, toute grasse de vice l'exaspérait en cuvant ainsi l'amour dont sa chair semblait gonflée, sans pouvoir même se réveiller. Nana ouvrait un œil, le refermait, s'étalait davantage.","Only one thing put Gervaise beside herself. It was when her daughter reappeared in tailed dresses and feathered hats. No, that luxury she couldn't swallow. Let Nana have a wedding, if she wanted; but, when she came to see her mother, that she dress at least as a worker should dress. The dresses with tails caused a revolution in the house: the Lorilleuxs laughed; Lantier, all exhilarated, circled around the little one, to sniff her good smell; the Boches had forbidden Pauline to frequent this rouchie, with her tinsel. And Gervaise was also angry at Nana's crushed sleep when, after one of her running away, she slept until noon, bareheaded, her bun undone and still full of hairpins, so white, breathing so short, that she seemed dead. She shook her five or six times in the morning, threatening to throw a pot of water on her belly. This beautiful lazy girl, half-naked, all fat with vice, exasperated him by sleeping off the love that seemed to swell her flesh, without even being able to wake up. Nana opened one eye, closed it again, spread out more.","Only one thing exasperated Gervaise now, and that was when her daughter appeared with a bonnet and feathers and a train. This she would not endure. When Nana came to her it must be as a simple workingwoman! None of this dearly bought finery should be exhibited there, for these trained dresses had created a great excitement in the house. One day Gervaise reproached her daughter violently for the life she led and finally, in her rage, took her by the shoulder and shook her.","There was only one thing that really bothered Gervaise. This was to see her daughter come home in a dress with a train and a hat covered with feathers. No, she couldn’t stomach this display. Nana might indulge in riotous living if she chose, but when she came home to her mother’s she ought to dress like a workgirl. The dresses with trains caused quite a sensation in the house; the Lorilleuxs sneered; Lantier, whose mouth sneered, turned the girl round to sniff at her delicious aroma; the Boches had forbidden Pauline to associate with this baggage in her frippery. And Gervaise was also angered by Nana’s exhausted slumber, when after one of her adventures, she slept till noon, with her chignon undone and still full of hair pins, looking so white and breathing so feebly that she seemed to be dead. Her mother shook her five or six times in the course of the morning, threatening to throw a jugful of water over her. The sight of this handsome lazy girl, half naked and besotted with wine, exasperated her, as she saw her lying there. Sometimes Nana opened an eye, closed it again, and then stretched herself out all the more."
- Père Bazouge ! père Bazouge ! cria Gervaise en haussant la voix.,"- Father Bazouge! Father Bazouge! cried Gervaise, raising her voice.","""Father Bazonge! Father Bazonge!"" The undertaker was kicking off his slippers, singing a vulgar song as he did so.","“Old Bazouge! Old Bazouge!” repeated Gervaise, raising her voice."
"- Dites donc, ma petite mère, ce sera pour une autre fois. Tout à votre service, entendez-vous ! Vous n'avez qu'à me faire signe. C'est moi qui suis le consolateur des dames ? Et ne crache pas sur le père Bazouge, parce qu'il en a tenu dans ses bras de plus chic que toi, qui se sont laissé arranger sans se plaindre, bien contentes de continuer leur dodo à l'ombre.","- Say, my little mother, it will be for another time. Everything at your service, you hear! You just have to give me a sign. Am I the comforter of the ladies? And don't spit on Father Bazouge, because he's held some more chic than you in his arms, who let themselves be arranged without complaining, very happy to continue their sleep in the shade.","""It will come for you another time,"" he said with a laugh; ""you have only to make me a little sign. I am a great consolation to women sometimes, and you need not sneer at poor Father Bazonge, for he has held many a fine lady in his arms, and they made no complaint when he laid them down to sleep in the shade of the evergreens.""","“See here, little woman, it’s only put off until another time. I’m entirely at your service, remember! You’ve only to make me a sign. I’m the ladies’ consoler. And don’t spit on old Bazouge, because he’s held in his arms finer ones than you, who let themselves be tucked in without a murmur, very pleased to continue their by-by in the dark.”"
"Quand Gervaise rentra rue de la Goutte-d'Or, elle trouva chez les Boche un tas de commères qui jabotaient d'une voix allumée. Elle crut qu'on l'attendait pour avoir des nouvelles, comme les autres jours.","When Gervaise returned to the rue de la Goutte-d'Or, she found a lot of gossips at the Boche's house, chattering in excited voices. She thought they were waiting for her to have news, like the other days.","When Gervaise went back she was met at the door by a crowd of people who wished to ask her questions, she thought.","When Gervaise got back to the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or she found at the Boches’ a number of women who were cackling in excited tones. She thought they were awaiting her to have the latest news, the same as the other days."
"- De l'argent ! où veux-tu donc que je l'aie volé ? ? Tu sais bien que j'ai eu trois francs avant-hier sur ma jupe noire. Nous avons déjeuné deux fois là-dessus, et l'on va vite, avec la charcuterie ? Non, sans doute, je n'ai pas d'argent. J'ai quatre sous pour le lavoir ? Je n'en gagne pas comme certaines femmes.","- Money ! where do you want me to have stolen it? ? You know very well that I got three francs the day before yesterday on my black skirt. We had lunch on it twice, and we go quickly, with the charcuterie? No, probably, I have no money. I have four sous to wash it? I don't win like some women.","""Money! Where should I get money unless I had stolen it? You know very well that day before yesterday you got three francs on my black skirt. We have breakfasted twice on that, and money goes fast. No, I have no money. I have four sous for the lavatory. I cannot make money like other women we know.""","“Money! And where do you think I can have stolen any? You know well enough that I got three francs the day before yesterday on my black skirt. We’ve lunched twice off it, and money goes quick at the pork-butcher ’s. No, you may be quite sure I’ve no money. I’ve four sous for the wash-house. I don’t have an extra income like some women.”"
"Elle dit merci. Elle fila raide sur le trottoir, en roulant l'idée de sauter aux yeux de Coupeau. Une petite pluie fine tombait, ce qui rendait la promenade encore moins amusante. Mais, quand elle fut arrivée devant l'Assommoir, la peur de la danser elle-même, si elle taquinait son homme, la calma brusquement et la rendit prudente. La boutique flambait, son gaz allumé, les glaces blanches comme des soleils, les fioles et les bocaux illuminant les murs de leurs verres de couleur. Elle resta là un instant, l'échine tendue, l'œil appliqué contre la vitre, entre deux bouteilles de l'étalage, à guigner Coupeau, dans le fond de la salle ; il était assis avec des camarades, autour d'une petite table de zinc, tous vagues et bleuis par la fumée des pipes ; et, comme on ne les entendait pas gueuler, ça faisait un drôle d'effet de les voir se démancher, le menton en avant, les yeux sortis de la figure. Était-il Dieu possible que des hommes pussent lâcher leurs femmes et leur chez eux pour s'enfermer ainsi dans un trou où ils étouffaient ! La pluie lui dégouttait le long du cou ; elle se releva, elle s'en alla sur le boulevard extérieur, réfléchissant, n'osant pas entrer. Ah bien ! Coupeau l'aurait joliment reçue, lui qui ne voulait pas être relancé ! Puis, vrai, ça ne lui semblait guère la place d'une femme honnête. Cependant, sous les arbres trempés, un léger frisson la prenait, et elle songeait, hésitante encore, qu'elle était pour sûr en train de pincer quelque bonne maladie. Deux fois, elle retourna se planter devant la vitre, son œil collé de nouveau, vexée de retrouver ces sacrés pochards à couvert, toujours gueulant et buvant. Le coup de lumière de l'Assommoir se reflétait dans les flaques des pavés, où la pluie mettait un frémissement de petits bouillons. Elle se sauvait, elle pataugeait là-dedans, dès que la porte s'ouvrait et retombait, avec le claquement de ses bandes de cuivre. Enfin, elle s'appela trop bête, elle poussa la porte et marcha droit à la table de Coupeau. Après tout, n'est-ce pas ? c'était son mari qu'elle venait demander ; et elle y était autorisée, puisqu'il avait promis, ce soir-là, de la mener au Cirque. Tant pis ! elle n'avait pas envie de fondre comme un pain de savon, sur le trottoir.","She says thank you. She sped off on the sidewalk, rolling over the idea of jumping in Coupeau's eyes. A light rain was falling, which made the walk even less fun. But, when she arrived in front of L'Assommoir, the fear of dancing her herself, if she teased her man, suddenly calmed her and made her cautious. The shop was on fire, its gas lit, the mirrors white as suns, the vials and jars illuminating the walls with their colored glasses. She stood there for a moment, her spine tense, her eyes glued to the glass, between two bottles on the display, peeking out Coupeau, at the back of the room; he was seated with some comrades around a small zinc table, all vague and blue from the smoke of their pipes; and, since you couldn't hear them yelling, it was a funny thing to see them loosening their arms, their chins thrust forward, their eyes sticking out of their faces. Was it possible that men could leave their wives and their homes to shut themselves up in a hole where they were suffocating! The rain dripped down his neck; she got up, she went on the outer boulevard, thinking, not daring to enter. Ah well ! Coupeau would have received it nicely, he who did not want to be revived! Then, true, it hardly seemed to him the place of an honest woman. However, under the soaked trees, a slight shiver took her, and she thought, still hesitantly, that she was definitely catching some good disease. Twice, she went back to plant herself in front of the window, her eye glued again, annoyed to find these damn drunks under cover, still yelling and drinking. The flash of light from L'Assommoir was reflected in the puddles of the cobblestones, where the rain caused a quivering of small bubbles. She ran away, she floundered in there, as soon as the door opened and fell, with the click of its brass bands. Finally, she called herself too stupid, she pushed open the door and walked straight to Coupeau's table. After all, right? it was her husband she had come to ask for; and she was allowed to, since he had promised that evening to take her to the Circus. Too bad ! she didn't want to melt like a bar of soap on the sidewalk.","Gervaise muttered her thanks and went with rapid steps to the Assommoir. A fine rain was falling. The gas in the tavern was blazing brightly, lighting up the mirrors, the bottles and glasses. She stood at the window and looked in. He was sitting at a table with his comrades. The atmosphere was thick with smoke, and he looked stupefied and half asleep. She shivered and wondered why she should stay there and, so thinking, turned away, only to come back twice to look again. The water lay on the uneven sidewalk in pools, reflecting all the lights from the Assommoir. Finally she determined on a bold step: she opened the door and deliberately walked up to her husband. After all, why should she not ask him why he had not kept his promise of taking her to the circus? At any rate, she would not stay out there in the rain and melt away like a cake of soap.","Gervaise uttered her thanks and stalked stiffly along the pavement with the determination of flying at Coupeau’s eyes. A fine rain was falling which made the walk more unpleasant still. But when she reached l’Assommoir, the fear of receiving the drubbing herself if she badgered her old man suddenly calmed her and made her prudent. The shop was ablaze with the lighted gas, the flames of which were as brilliant as suns, and the bottles and jars illuminated the walls with their colored glass. She stood there an instant stretching her neck, her eyes close to the window, looking between two bottle placed there for show, watching Coupeau who was right at the back; he was sitting with some comrades at a little zinc table, all looking vague and blue in the tobacco smoke; and, as one could not hear them yelling, it created a funny effect to see them gesticulating with their chins thrust forward and their eyes starting out of their heads. Good heavens! Was it really possible that men could leave their wives and their homes to shut themselves up thus in a hole where they were choking? The rain trickled down her neck; she drew herself up and went off to the exterior Boulevard, wrapped in thought and not daring to enter. Ah! well Coupeau would have welcomed her in a pleasant way, he who objected to be spied upon! Besides, it really scarcely seemed to her the proper place for a respectable woman. Twice she went back and stood before the shop window, her eyes again riveted to the glass, annoyed at still beholding those confounded drunkards out of the rain and yelling and drinking. The light of l’Assommoir was reflected in the puddles on the pavement, which simmered with little bubbles caused by the downpour. At length she thought she was too foolish, and pushing open the door, she walked straight up to the table where Coupeau was sitting. After all it was her husband she came for, was it not? And she was authorized in doing so, because he had promised to take her to the circus that evening. So much the worse! She had no desire to melt like a cake of soap out on the pavement."
"- Oh ! non, je ne sais rien ! ? Il aime à rire, je crois, voilà tout ? Ainsi, les deux filles qui logent chez nous, Adèle et Virginie, vous les connaissez, eh bien ! il plaisante avec elles, et ça ne va pas plus loin, j'en suis sûre.","- Oh ! no, I don't know anything! ? He likes to laugh, I think, that's all? So the two girls who stay with us, Adèle and Virginie, you know them, well! he jokes with them, and it goes no further, I'm sure.","""Oh, I know nothing,"" she continued. "" He likes to laugh—that is all—and those two girls who are with us, you know, Adèle and Virginie, like to laugh too, so they have their little jokes together, but that is all there is of it , I am sure.""","Then she exclaimed, “Oh, no! I don’t know anything! He likes to laugh a bit, I think, that’s all. For instance, you know the two girls who lodge at my place, Adele and Virginie. Well, he larks about with ’em, but he just flirts for sport.”"
"Et il se redressait, comme pour mieux entendre la chanson délicieuse de l'eau ; il aspirait l'air fortement, croyant boire la pluie fraîche envolée des fontaines. Mais, peu à peu, sa face reprit une expression d'angoisse. Alors, il se courba, il fila plus vite le long des murs de la cellule, avec de sourdes menaces.","And he sat up, as if to better hear the delicious song of the water; he inhaled the air strongly, thinking he was drinking the cool rain that had flown from the fountains. But, little by little, his face resumed an expression of anguish. So he bent down, he ran faster along the walls of the cell, with muffled threats.","He drew a long breath, as if enjoying the delicious freshness of the air. By degrees, however, his features contracted again with pain, and he ran quickly around the wall of his cell.","And he drew himself up, as though the better to hear the delicious song of the water; he sucked in forcibly, fancying he was drinking the fresh spray blown from the fountains. But, little by little, his face resumed an agonized expression. Then he crouched down and flew quicker than ever around the walls of the cell, uttering vague threats."
"- Laisse-moi, tu me chatouilles, cria-t-elle en riant plus fort. Quelle grosse bête ! On n'est pas bête comme ça !","- Leave me, you tickle me, she cried, laughing harder. What a big beast! We are not stupid like that!","She pushed him aside with a laugh. ""You ought to be ashamed!""","“Leave off, you’re tickling me,” cried she, laughing the louder. “What a great silly you are! How can you be so absurd?”"
"Gervaise ne disait rien, ne bougeait pas, les yeux fixes dans le vide. Elle finit par hocher lentement la tête, comme pour répondre aux idées qu'elle gardait en elle, pendant que le chapelier, la mine friande, murmurait :","Gervaise said nothing, did not move, her eyes staring into space. She ended up nodding her head slowly, as if to respond to the ideas she kept inside her, while the hatter, with a fond expression, murmured:","Gervaise said nothing; her eyes were fixed on vacancy. She shook her head slowly, as if in reply to her own thoughts.","Gervaise said nothing, nor did she move; her eyes staring into space. She ended by jerking her head to and fro, as if in answer to her thoughts, whilst the hatter, with a gluttonous mien, muttered:"
"Les Coupeau, devant le monde, affectèrent d'être bien débarrassés. Au fond, ils rageaient. Mais la rage n'a toujours qu'un temps. Bientôt, ils apprirent, sans même cligner un œil, que Nana roulait le quartier. Gervaise, qui l'accusait de faire ça pour les déshonorer, se mettait au-dessus des potins ; elle pouvait rencontrer sa donzelle dans la rue, elle ne se salirait seulement pas la main à lui envoyer une baffe ; oui, c'était bien fini, elle l'aurait trouvée en train de crever par terre, la peau nue sur le pavé, qu'elle serait passée sans dire que ce chameau venait de ses entrailles. Nana allumait tous les bals des environs. On la connaissait de la Reine-Blanche au Grand Salon de la folie. Quand elle entrait à l'Elysée-Montmartre, on montait sur les tables pour lui voir faire, à la pastourelle, l'écrevisse qui renifle. Comme on l'avait flanquée deux fois dehors, au Château-Rouge, elle rôdait seulement devant la porte, en attendant des personnes de sa connaissance. La Boule-Noire, sur le boulevard, et le Grand-Turc, rue des Poissonniers, étaient des salles comme il faut où elle allait lorsqu'elle avait du linge. Mais, de tous les bastringues du quartier, elle préférait encore le Bal de l'Ermitage, dans une cour humide, et le Bal Robert, impasse du Cadran, deux infectes petites salles éclairées par une demi-douzaine de quinquets, tenues à la papa, tous contents et tous libres, si bien qu'on laissait les cavaliers et leurs dames s'embrasser au fond, sans les déranger. Et Nana avait des hauts et des bas, de vrais coups de baguette, tantôt nippée comme une femme chic, tantôt balayant la crotte comme une souillon. Ah ! elle menait une belle vie !","The Coupeaus, in front of the world, pretended to be well rid of them. Deep down, they were raging. But rage is always short-lived. Soon they learned, without even blinking an eye, that Nana was ripping off the neighborhood. Gervaise, who accused him of doing this to dishonor them, put herself above gossip; she could meet her damsel in the street, she wouldn't just get her hand dirty slapping her; yes, it was all over, she would have found her dying on the ground, her bare skin on the pavement, which she would have passed without saying that this camel had come from her entrails. Nana lit up all the balls in the area. We knew her from the Reine-Blanche at the Grand Salon de la folie. When she entered the Elysée-Montmartre, people climbed the tables to see her do, à la pastourelle, the sniffling crayfish. As they had thrown her out twice, at the Chateau-Rouge, she was just prowling in front of the door, waiting for people she knew. The Boule-Noire, on the boulevard, and the Grand-Turc, rue des Poissonniers, were decent rooms where she went when she had clothes. But, of all the clubs in the neighborhood, she still preferred the Bal de l'Ermitage, in a damp courtyard, and the Bal Robert, impasse du Cadran, two filthy little rooms lit by half a dozen quinquets, held à la papa. , all happy and all free, so that the cavaliers and their ladies were left to embrace each other in the background, without disturbing them. And Nana had ups and downs, real blows of the wand, sometimes dressed up like a chic woman, sometimes sweeping the poop like a slut. Ah! she had a good life!","The Coupeaus pretended to be rather pleased, but in their hearts they raged, particularly as they soon learned that Nana was frequently seen in the Quartier. Gervaise declared this was done by the girl to annoy them.","In the presence of other people the Coupeaus pretended they were very glad to be rid of the girl, though in reality they were enraged. However, rage can’t last forever, and soon they heard without even blinking that Nana was seen in the neighborhood. Gervaise, who accused her of doing it to enrage them, set herself above the scandal; she might meet her daughter on the street, she said; she wouldn’t even dirty her hand to cuff her; yes, it was all over; she might have seen her lying in the gutter, dying on the pavement, and she would have passed by without even admitting that such a hussy was her own child. Nana meanwhile was enlivening the dancing halls of the neighborhood. She was known from the “Ball of Queen Blanche” to the “Great Hall of Folly.” When she entered the “Elysee-Montmartre,” folks climbed onto the tables to see her do the “sniffling crawfish” during the pastourelle. As she had twice been turned out of the “Chateau Rouge” hall, she walked outside the door waiting for someone she knew to escort her inside. The “Black Ball” on the outer Boulevard and the “Grand Turk” in the Rue des Poissonniers, were respectable places where she only went when she had some fine dress on. Of all the jumping places of the neighborhood, however, those she most preferred were the “Hermitage Ball” in a damp courtyard and “Robert’s Ball” in the Impasse du Cadran, two dirty little halls, lighted up with a half dozen oil lamps, and kept very informally, everyone pleased and everyone free, so much so that the men and their girls kissed each other at their ease, in the dances, without being disturbed. Nana had ups and downs, perfect transformations, now tricked out like a stylish woman and now all dirt. Ah! she had a fine life."
"Madame Boche vit les larmes lui remonter aux yeux, et, satisfaite sans doute, elle s'éloignait en traitant les hommes de sacrés fainéants, lorsqu'elle revint, pour crier :","Madame Boche saw the tears well up in her eyes, and, no doubt satisfied, she was walking away, calling the men bloody idlers, when she came back to shout:","Madame saw the tears come to her eyes and, satisfied with her discovery, was turning away when she suddenly stopped and called out:","Madame Boche saw the tears come into her eyes; and, satisfied no doubt, she turned to go, declaring men to be a cursed, lazy set. As she went off, she called back:"
"Il lançait des claques dans le vide, tirait sa couverture, la roulait en tapon contre sa poitrine, comme pour la protéger contre les violences des hommes barbus qu'il voyait. Alors, un gardien étant accouru, Gervaise se retira, toute glacée par cette scène. Mais, lorsqu'elle revint, quelques jours plus tard, elle trouva Coupeau complètement guéri. Les cauchemars eux-mêmes s'en étaient allés ; il avait un sommeil d'enfant, il dormait ses dix heures sans bouger un membre. Aussi permit-on à sa femme de l'emmener. Seulement, l'interne lui dit à la sortie les bonnes paroles d'usage, en lui conseillant de les méditer. S'il recommençait à boire, il retomberait et finirait par y laisser sa peau. Oui, ça dépendait uniquement de lui. Il avait vu comme on redevenait gaillard et gentil, quand on ne se soûlait pas. Eh bien ! il devait continuer à la maison sa vie sage de Sainte-Anne, s'imaginer qu'il était sous clef et que les marchands de vin n'existaient plus.","He was slapping in the air, pulling his blanket, rolling it like a tapon against his chest, as if to protect her against the violence of the bearded men he saw. Then, a guard having rushed up, Gervaise withdrew, completely frozen by this scene. But when she returned a few days later, she found Coupeau completely cured. The nightmares themselves were gone; he slept like a child, he slept his ten hours without moving a limb. So his wife was allowed to take him away. Only, the intern told him the usual good words when he left, advising him to meditate on them. If he started to drink again, he would fall back and eventually lose his skin. Yes, it was up to him. He had seen how lively and nice one became again when one didn't get drunk. Well ! he had to continue his wise life at Sainte-Anne at home, imagining that he was locked up and that the wine merchants no longer existed.","He pulled the covering hastily over his head, as if to protect himself against the creature he saw. Then starting up in mad terror, he screamed aloud. A nurse ran to the bed, and Gervaise was sent away, mute with horror at this scene. But when on the following Sunday she went again to the hospital, Coupeau was really well. All his dreams had vanished. He slept like a child, ten hours without lifting a finger. His wife, therefore, was allowed to take him away. The house surgeon gave him a few words of advice before he left, assuring him if he continued to drink he would be a dead man in three months. All depended on himself. He could live at home just as he had lived at Sainte-Anne's and must forget that such things as wine and brandy existed.","He dealt blows into space, caught hold of his blanket and rolled it into a bundle against his chest, as though to protect the latter from the violence of the bearded men whom he beheld. Then, an attendant having hastened to the spot, Gervaise withdrew, quite frozen by the scene. But when she returned a few days later, she found Coupeau completely cured. Even the nightmares had left him; he could sleep his ten hours right off as peacefully as a child and without stirring a limb. So his wife was allowed to take him away. The house surgeon gave him the usual good advice on leaving and advised him to follow it. If he recommenced drinking, he would again collapse and would end by dying. Yes, it solely depended upon himself. He had seen how jolly and healthy one could become when one did not get drunk. Well, he must continue at home the sensible life he had led at Sainte-Anne, fancy himself under lock and key and that dram-shops no longer existed."
"- Alors, non ? vous dites non ?","- So, right? you say no?","""Then you say no, do you? Absolutely no?""",“So it’s to be ‘no’? you say ‘no’?”
"Mademoiselle Remanjou ayant parlé d'aller à la campagne tout de même, quand on devrait s'arrêter dans le fossé des fortifications, la noce se récria : les chemins devaient être jolis, on ne pourrait seulement pas s'asseoir sur l'herbe ; puis, ça ne paraissait pas fini, il reviendrait peut-être une saucée. Coupeau, qui suivait des yeux un ouvrier trempé marchant tranquillement sous la pluie, murmura :","Mademoiselle Remanjou having spoken of going to the country all the same, when we should stop in the ditch of the fortifications, the wedding party cried out: the paths must be pretty, we just couldn't sit on the grass; then, it didn't seem to be over, maybe he would come back for a drink. Coupeau, who was watching a drenched workman walking quietly in the rain, murmured:","Then Mile Remanjon timidly observed that the sun perhaps would soon be out, and they might yet go into the country; upon this there was one general shout of derision.","Mademoiselle Remanjou, having suggested going into the country all the same, even though they went no farther than the moat of the fortifications, the others scouted the idea: the roads would be in a nice state, one would not even be able to sit down on the grass; besides, it did not seem to be all over yet, there might perhaps be another downpour. Coupeau, who had been watching a workman, completely soaked, yet quietly walking along in the rain, murmured:"
"- Mais non, pas du tout ? Il était cinq heures, quand nous avons quitté la mère Baquet. Voilà ! ? Il a peut-être bien descendu la rue. Oui, même je crois l'avoir vu entrer au Papillon avec un cocher ? Oh ! que c'est bête ! Vrai, on est bon à tuer !","- But no not at all ? It was five o'clock when we left Mother Baquet. There ! ? He may well have walked down the street. Yes, even I believe I saw him enter the Papillon with a coachman? Oh ! how stupid! True, we are good to kill!","""And you know nothing of my husband?"" asked Gervaise. ""No, nothing. I think, though, he went off with a coachman."" Lantier and Gervaise passed a very agreeable evening at the cafe concert, and when the doors were closed at eleven they went home in a sauntering sort of fashion.","“And you don’t know where my husband is, sir?” asked the laundress. “Well, no, not a bit. It was five o’clock when we left mother Baquet’s. That’s all I know about it. Perhaps he went down the street. Yes, I fancy now that I saw him go to the ‘Butterfly’ with a coachman. Oh! how stupid it is! Really, we deserve to be shot.”"
"Les Coupeau sortaient presque tous les dimanches avec les Goujet. C'étaient des parties gentilles, une friture à Saint-Ouen ou un lapin à Vincennes, mangés sans épate, sous le bosquet d'un traiteur. Les hommes buvaient à leur soif, revenaient sains comme l'œil, en donnant le bras aux dames. Le soir, avant de se coucher, les deux ménages comptaient, partageaient la dépense par moitié ; et jamais un sou en plus ou en moins ne soulevait une discussion. Les Lorilleux étaient jaloux des Goujet. Ça leur paraissait drôle, tout de même, de voir Cadet-Cassis et la Banban aller sans cesse avec des étrangers, quand ils avaient une famille. Ah bien ! oui ! ils s'en souciaient comme d'une guigne, de leur famille ! Depuis qu'ils avaient quatre sous de côté, ils faisaient joliment leur tête. Madame Lorilleux, très vexée de voir son frère lui échapper, recommençait à vomir des injures contre Gervaise. Madame Lerat, au contraire, prenait parti pour la jeune femme, la défendait en racontant des contes extraordinaires, des tentatives de séduction, le soir, sur le boulevard, dont elle la montrait sortant en héroïne de drame, flanquant une paire de claques à ses lâches agresseurs. Quant à maman Coupeau, elle tâchait de raccommoder tout le monde, de se faire bien venir de tous ses enfants : sa vue baissait de plus en plus, elle n'avait plus qu'un ménage, elle était contente de trouver cent sous chez les uns et chez les autres.","The Coupeaus went out almost every Sunday with the Goujets. They were nice parties, a frying pan at Saint-Ouen or a rabbit at Vincennes, eaten without awe, under the grove of a caterer. The men drank to their thirst, returned healthy as the eye, arm in arm with the ladies. In the evening, before going to bed, the two households counted, shared the expense in half; and never a penny more or less raised a discussion. The Lorilleuxs were jealous of the Goujets. It seemed funny to them, all the same, to see Cadet-Cassis and la Banban constantly going out with strangers when they had a family. Ah well ! yes ! they cared a little about their family! Since they had four sous aside, they put on a good face. Madame Lorilleux, very annoyed at seeing her brother escape her, began to vomit abuse against Gervaise. Madame Lerat, on the contrary, sided with the young woman, defended her by telling extraordinary tales, attempts at seduction, in the evening, on the boulevard, from which she showed her emerging as the heroine of a drama, slapping a pair of cowardly aggressors. As for mother Coupeau, she tried to make everyone happy, to make all her children come to her well: her eyesight was failing more and more, she had only one household left, she was happy to find a hundred sous at the each other.","The Coupeaus and the Goujets now went out on Sundays together. It was an orderly party with a dinner at some quiet restaurant. The men drank a glass or two of wine and came home with the ladies and counted up and settled the expenditures of the day before they separated. The Lorilleuxs were bitterly jealous of these new friends of their brother's. They declared it had a very queer look to see him and his wife always with strangers rather than with his own family, and Mme Lorilleux began to say hateful things again of Gervaise. Mme Lerat, on the contrary, took her part, while Mamma Coupeau tried to please everyone.","The Coupeaus went out nearly every Sunday with the Goujets. They were pleasant little excursions, sometimes to have some fried fish at Saint-Ouen, at others a rabbit at Vincennes, in the garden of some eating-house keeper without any grand display. The men drank sufficient to quench their thirst, and returned home as right as nine-pins, giving their arms to the ladies. In the evening before going to bed, the two families made up accounts and each paid half the expenses; and there was never the least quarrel about a sou more or less. The Lorilleuxs became jealous of the Goujets. It seemed strange to them to see Young Cassis and Clump-clump going places all the time with strangers instead of their own relations. But, that’s the way it was; some folks didn’t care a bit about their family. Now that they had saved a few sous, they thought they were really somebody. Madame Lorilleux was much annoyed to see her brother getting away from her influence and begin to continually run down Gervaise to everyone. On the other hand, Madame Lerat took the young wife’s side. Mother Coupeau tried to get along with everybody. She only wanted to be welcomed by all three of her children. Now that her eyesight was getting dimmer and dimmer she only had one regular house cleaning job but she was able to pick up some small jobs now and again."
"- Est-ce que madame demande quelqu'un ? cria la concierge, intriguée, en paraissant à la porte de la loge.","- Is Madame asking for someone? cried the intrigued concierge, appearing at the door of the box.","""Are you looking for anyone?"" asked the concierge, coming to her door considerably puzzled.","“Is madame seeking for any one?” called out the inquisitive concierge, emerging from her room."
"Poisson se leva, salua poliment Gervaise, que sa femme lui présenta comme une ancienne amie. Mais il n'était pas causeur, il reprit tout de suite sa petite scie. De temps à autre, il lançait seulement un regard sur le maquereau, posé au bord de la commode. Gervaise fut très contente de revoir son ancien logement ; elle dit où les meubles étaient placés, et elle montra l'endroit où elle avait accouché, par terre. Comme ça se rencontrait, pourtant ! Quand elles s'étaient perdues de vue toutes deux, autrefois, elles n'auraient jamais cru se retrouver ainsi, en habitant l'une après l'autre la même chambre. Virginie ajouta de nouveaux détails sur elle et son mari : il avait fait un petit héritage d'une tante ; il l'établirait sans doute plus tard ; pour le moment, elle continuait à s'occuper de couture, elle bâclait une robe par-ci par-là. Enfin, au bout d'une grosse demi-heure, la blanchisseuse voulut partir. Poisson tourna à peine le dos. Virginie, qui l'accompagna, promit de lui rendre sa visite ; d'ailleurs, elle lui donnait sa pratique, c'était une chose entendue. Et, comme elle la gardait sur le palier, Gervaise s'imagina qu'elle désirait lui parler de Lantier et de sa sœur Adèle, la brunisseuse. Elle en était toute révolutionnée à l'intérieur. Mais pas un mot ne fut échangé sur ces choses ennuyeuses, elles se quittèrent en se disant au revoir, d'un air très aimable.","Poisson stood up, politely bowed to Gervaise, whom his wife introduced to him as an old friend. But he was not a conversationalist, he immediately picked up his little saw. From time to time, he only glanced at the pimp, sitting on the edge of the chest of drawers. Gervaise was very happy to see her old lodgings again; she said where the furniture was placed, and she pointed to the place where she had given birth, on the floor. How it met, however! When they had lost sight of each other in the past, they would never have thought they would find themselves like this, living one after the other in the same room. Virginie added new details about herself and her husband: he had inherited a small inheritance from an aunt; he would no doubt establish it later; for the moment, she continued to busy herself with sewing, she was rushing a dress here and there. Finally, after a good half hour, the laundress wanted to leave. Fish barely turned his back. Virginie, who accompanied him, promised to pay him a visit; besides, she gave him her practice, it was an agreed thing. And, as she watched her on the landing, Gervaise imagined that she wanted to talk to her about Lantier and his sister Adele, the burnisher. She was completely revolutionized inside. But not a word was exchanged on these boring things, they left saying goodbye, with a very friendly air.","Poisson rose and bowed politely to Gervaise, whom his wife called an old friend. But he did not speak, his conversational powers not being his strong point. He cast a plaintive glance at the mackerel, however, from time to time. Gervaise looked around the room and described her furniture and where it had stood. How strange it was, after losing sight of each other so long, that they should occupy the same apartment! Virginie entered into new details. He had a small inheritance from his aunt, and she herself sewed a little, made a dress now and then. At the end of a half-hour Gervaise rose to depart; Virginie went to the head of the stairs with her, and there both hesitated. Gervaise fancied that Virginie wished to say something about Lantier and Adèle, but they separated without touching on these disagreeable topics.","Poisson rose from his seat and politely bowed to Gervaise, when his wife introduced her as an old friend. But he was no talker; he at once returned to his little saw. From time to time he merely glanced in the direction of the mackerel placed on the corner of the chest of drawers. Gervaise was very pleased to see her old lodging once more. She told them whereabouts her own furniture stood, and pointed out the place on the floor where Nana had been born. How strange it was to meet like this again, after so many years! They never dreamed of running into each other like this and even living in the same rooms. Virginie added some further details. Her husband had inherited a little money from an aunt and he would probably set her up in a shop before long. Meanwhile she was still sewing. At length, at the end of a full half hour, the laundress took her leave. Poisson scarcely seemed to notice her departure. While seeing her to the door, Virginie promised to return the visit. And she would have Gervaise do her laundry. While Virginie was keeping her in further conversation on the landing, Gervaise had the feeling that she wanted to say something about Lantier and her sister Adele, and this notion upset her a bit. But not a word was uttered respecting those unpleasant things; they parted, wishing each other good-bye in a very amiable manner."
"Alors, Gervaise, les bras tendus, ne sachant plus ce qu'elle bégayait, se mit à le supplier avec passion.","Then Gervaise, her arms outstretched, no longer knowing what she was stammering, began to implore him passionately.","Then Gervaise, with arms outstretched, not knowing or caring what she said, began to entreat him with passionate vehemence:","Then, Gervaise, stretching out her arms, no longer knowing what she stuttered, began passionately to implore him:"
"Elle l'interrompit par un long rire. C'était vrai, pourtant, elle avait donné le fouet à cette grande carcasse de Virginie. Ce jour-là, elle aurait étranglé quelqu'un de bien bon cœur. Et elle se mit à rire plus fort, parce que Coupeau lui racontait que Virginie, désolée d'avoir tout montré, venait de quitter le quartier. Son visage, pourtant, gardait une douceur enfantine ; elle avançait ses mains potelées, en répétant qu'elle n'écraserait pas une mouche ; elle ne connaissait les coups que pour en avoir déjà joliment reçu dans sa vie. Alors, elle en vint à causer de sa jeunesse, à Plassans. Elle n'était point coureuse du tout ; les hommes l'ennuyaient ; quand Lantier l'avait prise, à quatorze ans, elle trouvait ça gentil, parce qu'il se disait son mari et qu'elle croyait jouer au ménage. Son seul défaut, assurait-elle, était d'être très sensible, d'aimer tout le monde, de se passionner pour des gens qui lui faisaient ensuite mille misères. Ainsi, quand elle aimait un homme, elle ne songeait pas aux bêtises, elle rêvait uniquement de vivre toujours ensemble, très heureux. Et, comme Coupeau ricanait et lui parlait de ses deux enfants, qu'elle n'avait certainement pas mis couver sous le traversin, elle lui allongea des tapes sur les doigts, elle ajouta que, bien sûr, elle était bâtie sur le patron des autres femmes ; seulement, on avait tort de croire les femmes toujours acharnées après ça ; les femmes songeaient à leur ménage, se coupaient en quatre dans la maison, se couchaient trop lasses, le soir, pour ne pas dormir tout de suite. Elle, d'ailleurs, ressemblait à sa mère, une grosse travailleuse, morte à la peine, qui avait servi de bête de somme au père Macquart pendant plus de vingt ans. Elle était encore toute mince, tandis que sa mère avait des épaules à démolir les portes en passant ; mais ça n'empêchait pas, elle lui ressemblait par sa rage de s'attacher aux gens. Même, si elle boitait un peu, elle tenait ça de la pauvre femme, que le père Macquart rouait de coups. Cent fois, celle-ci lui avait raconté les nuits où le père, rentrant soûl, se montrait d'une galanterie si brutale, qu'il lui cassait les membres ; et, sûrement elle avait poussé une de ces nuits-là, avec sa jambe en retard.","She interrupted him with a long laugh. It was true, however, she had given the whip to this great carcass of Virginia. That day, she would have strangled someone with a good heart. And she began to laugh harder, because Coupeau was telling her that Virginie, sorry to have shown everything, had just left the neighborhood. Her face, however, retained a childish sweetness; she stretched out her chubby hands, repeating that she would not swat a fly; she knew the blows only for having already received them nicely in her life. So she came to talk about her youth at Plassans. She was no runner at all; the men bored him; when Lantier had taken her, when she was fourteen, she thought it was nice, because he called himself her husband and she thought she was playing housework. Her only fault, she asserted, was to be very sensitive, to love everyone, to be passionate about people who then caused her a thousand miseries. So, when she loved a man, she didn't think about nonsense, she only dreamed of always living together, very happily. And, as Coupeau sneered and talked to her about her two children, whom she had certainly not put brooding under the bolster, she slapped her on the fingers, she added that, of course, she was built on the boss of the other women; only, it was wrong to believe that women were always fierce after that; the women thought of their housework, cut themselves over in the house, went to bed too tired at night not to sleep right away. She, moreover, resembled her mother, a heavy worker, barely dead, who had served as father Macquart's beast of burden for more than twenty years. She was still quite thin, while her mother had the shoulders to demolish doors as she passed; but that didn't prevent her, she resembled him in her rage for becoming attached to people. Even if she limped a little, she got it from the poor woman, whom old Macquart beat up. A hundred times, she had told him of the nights when the father, coming home drunk, displayed such brutal gallantry that he broke his limbs; and, surely she had pushed one of those nights, with her lagging leg.","She laughed gaily. Yes, it was true she had whipped that great Virginie. That day she could have strangled someone with a glad heart. And she laughed again, because Coupeau told her that Virginie, in her humiliation, had left the Quartier. Gervaise's face, as she laughed, however, had a certain childish sweetness. She extended her slender, dimpled hands, declaring she would not hurt a fly. All she knew of blows was that she had received a good many in her life. Then she began to talk of Plassans and of her youth. She had never been indiscreet, nor was she fond of men. When she had fallen in with Lantier she was only fourteen, and she regarded him as her husband. Her only fault, she declared, was that she was too amiable and allowed people to impose on her and that she got fond of people too easily; were she to love another man, she should wish and expect to live quietly and comfortably with him always, without any nonsense. And when Coupeau slyly asked her if she called her dear children nonsense she gave him a little slap and said that she, of course, was much like other women. But women were not like men, after all; they had their homes to take care of and keep clean; she was like her mother, who had been a slave to her brutal father for more than twenty years! ""My very lameness—"" she continued. ""Your lameness?"" interrupted Coupeau gallantly.","She interrupted him with a hearty laugh. It was true, though, she had whipped Virginie’s tall carcass. She would have delighted in strangling someone on that day. She laughed louder than ever when Coupeau told her that Virginie, ashamed at having shown so much cowardice, had left the neighborhood. Her face, however, preserved an expression of childish gentleness as she put out her plump hands, insisting she wouldn’t even harm a fly. She began to tell Coupeau about her childhood at Plassans. She had never cared overmuch for men; they had always bored her. She was fourteen when she got involved with Lantier. She had thought it was nice because he said he was her husband and she had enjoyed playing a housewife. She was too soft-hearted and too weak. She always got passionately fond of people who caused her trouble later. When she loved a man, she wasn’t thinking of having fun in the present; she was dreaming about being happy and living together forever. And as Coupeau, with a chuckle, spoke of her two children, saying they hadn’t come from under a bolster, she slapped his fingers; she added that she was, no doubt made on the model of other women; women thought of their home, slaved to keep the place clean and tidy, and went to bed too tired at night not to go to sleep at once. Besides, she resembled her mother, a stout laboring woman who died at her work and who had served as beast of burden to old Macquart for more than twenty years. Her mother’s shoulders had been heavy enough to smash through doors, but that didn’t prevent her from being soft-hearted and madly attracted to people. And if she limped a little, she no doubt owed that to the poor woman, whom old Macquart used to belabor with blows. Her mother had told her about the times when Macquart came home drunk and brutally bruised her. She had probably been born with her lame leg as a result of one of those times."
"- Oui, allez vous coucher, monsieur Coupeau, ça vaudra mieux, déclara madame Putois.","""Yes, go to bed, Monsieur Coupeau, it will be better,"" declared Madame Putois.",Gervaise undressed her husband and tucked him up in bed as if he had been a child and then returned to her fluting irons in time to still a grand dispute that was going on about an iron that had not been properly cleaned.,"“Yes, go to bed, Monsieur Coupeau; it will be far better,” exclaimed Madame Putois."
"- Non, bien sûr, répondit Nana tranquillement. Je ne regarde rien ? Je regarde qu'il fait joliment chaud. Vrai, il y a de quoi vous donner du mal à vous faire courir ainsi.","- No, of course not, answered Nana calmly. Am I not watching anything? I see that it is nicely warm. True, there is enough to give you trouble to make you run like this.","""No indeed,"" answered Nana carelessly; ""nor am I looking at anything. It is awfully warm, and of all things in the world, I hate to be in a hurry.""","“No, you may be sure of that,” answered Nana coolly. “I’m looking at nothing—I’m seeing how hot it is. It’s enough to make anyone, having to run like that.”"
"En haut, la chambre était nue, pleine de soleil, la fenêtre ouverte. Ce coup de soleil, cette nappe de poussière d'or dansante, rendait lamentables le plafond noir, les murs au papier arraché. Il n'y avait plus, à un clou de la cheminée, qu'un petit fichu de femme, tordu comme une ficelle. Le lit des enfants, tiré au milieu de la pièce, découvrait la commode, dont les tiroirs laissés ouverts montraient leurs flancs vides. Lantier s'était lavé et avait achevé la pommade, deux sous de pommade dans une carte à jouer ; l'eau grasse de ses mains emplissait la cuvette. Et il n'avait rien oublié, le coin occupé jusque-là par la malle paraissait à Gervaise faire un trou immense. Elle ne retrouva même pas le petit miroir rond, accroché à l'espagnolette. Alors, elle eut un pressentiment, elle regarda sur la cheminée : Lantier avait emporté les reconnaissances, le paquet rose tendre n'était plus là, entre les flambeaux de zinc dépareillés.","Upstairs, the room was bare, full of sunlight, the window open. This sunburn, this sheet of dancing gold dust, made the black ceiling, the torn paper walls, lamentable. There was only a little woman's kerchief, twisted like a string, by a nail in the chimney. The children's bed, pulled out in the middle of the room, exposed the chest of drawers, the drawers of which, left open, showed their empty sides. Lantier had washed and finished the ointment, two pennies worth of ointment in a playing card; the greasy water from his hands filled the basin. And he hadn't forgotten anything, the corner occupied until then by the trunk seemed to Gervaise to make a huge hole. She couldn't even find the little round mirror hanging from the latch. Then she had a presentiment, she looked at the fireplace: Lantier had taken the recognitions, the soft pink packet was no longer there, between the mismatched zinc candlesticks.","Her room was empty, filled with the glowing sunlight from the open window. This golden light rendered more apparent the blackened ceiling and the walls with the shabby, dilapidated paper. There was not an article beyond the furniture left in the room, except a woman's fichu that seemed to have caught on a nail near the chimney. The children's bed was pulled out into the center of the room; the bureau drawers were wide open, displaying their emptiness. Lantier had washed and had used the last of the pomade—two cents' worth on the back of a playing card—the dirty water in which he had washed still stood in the basin. He had forgotten nothing; the corner hitherto occupied by his trunk now seemed to Gervaise a vast desert. Even the small mirror was gone. With a presentiment of evil she turned hastily to the chimney. Yes, she was right, Lantier had carried away the tickets. The pink papers were no longer between the candlesticks!","Upstairs the room was bare, in spite of the sunshine which entered through the open window. That blaze of light, that kind of dancing golden dust, exposed the lamentable condition of the blackened ceiling, and of the walls half denuded of paper, all the more. The only thing left hanging in the room was a woman’s small neckerchief, twisted like a piece of string. The children’s bedstead, drawn into the middle of the apartment, displayed the chest of drawers, the open drawers of which exposed their emptiness. Lantier had washed himself and had used up the last of the pomatum—two sous’ worth of pomatum in a playing card; the greasy water from his hands filled the basin. And he had forgotten nothing. The corner which until then had been filled by the trunk seemed to Gervaise an immense empty space. Even the little mirror which hung on the window-fastening was gone. When she made this discovery, she had a presentiment. She looked on the mantel-piece. Lantier had taken away the pawn tickets; the pink bundle was no longer there, between the two odd zinc candlesticks."
"Cependant, Coupeau, tombant en plein dans la pastourelle, dérangeait la figure et recevait des bourrades.","However, Coupeau, falling right into the pastourelle, disturbed the face and received thumps.",At this moment Coupeau fell on his daughter.,Coupeau was trying to force his way through the dancers and was disrupting the quadrille.
"- Ah ! fichtre alors, je garderai votre petite machine ! reprit Lantier en riant. Vous savez, je me la mettrai au cou avec un ruban. Puis, brusquement, comme si cette idée en éveillait une autre :","- Oh! Damn then, I'll keep your little machine! resumed Lantier, laughing. You know, I'll put it around my neck with a ribbon. Then, suddenly, as if this idea awakened another:","""By the way,"" said Lantier, addressing himself to Gervaise, ""I saw Nana last night.""","“Ah, if that’s the case, I’ll keep your little memento!” rejoined Lantier with a laugh. “I’ll hang it round my neck with a ribbon.” Then suddenly, as if this thought brought another one to his memory, “By the way,” he cried, “I met Nana last night.”"
"- Hein ? quel pif ! dit la vieille femme. Vous n'avez pas pu les voir, vous. Mais moi, je les guettais ? Quand elle a aperçu la table, tenez ! sa figure s'est tortillée comme ça, les coins de sa bouche sont montés toucher ses yeux ; et lui, ça l'a étranglé, il s'est mis à tousser ? Maintenant, regardez-les, là-bas ; ils n'ont plus de salive, ils se mangent les lèvres.","- Eh ? what a prick! said the old woman. You couldn't see them. But I was watching them? When she saw the table, look! her face squirmed like that, the corners of her mouth came up to touch her eyes; and him, it strangled him, he started coughing? Now, look at them over there; they have no more saliva, they eat their lips.","""Did you see her?"" she said eagerly. ""I was watching her, and when she saw the table her face was as long as my arm, and now she is gnawing her lips; she is so mad!""","“Huh! What a sight!” said the old woman. “You couldn’t see them; but I was watching. When she caught sight of the table her face twisted around like that, the corners of her mouth almost touched her eyes; and as for him, it nearly choked him, he coughed and coughed. Now just look at them over there; they’ve no saliva left in their mouths, they’re chewing their lips.”"
"Cependant, l'hiver était venu, le quatrième hiver que les Coupeau passaient rue de la Goutte-d'Or. Cette année-là, décembre et janvier furent particulièrement durs. Il gelait à pierre fendre. Après le jour de l'an, la neige resta trois semaines dans la rue sans se fondre. Ça n'empêchait pas le travail, au contraire, car l'hiver est la belle saison des repasseuses. Il faisait joliment bon dans la boutique ! On n'y voyait jamais de glaçons aux vitres, comme chez l'épicier et le bonnetier d'en face. La mécanique, bourrée de coke, entretenait là une chaleur de baignoire ; les linges fumaient, on se serait cru en plein été ; et l'on était bien, les portes fermées, ayant chaud partout, tellement chaud, qu'on aurait fini par dormir, les yeux ouverts. Gervaise disait en riant qu'elle s'imaginait être à la campagne. En effet, les voitures ne faisaient plus de bruit en roulant sur la neige ; c'était à peine si l'on entendait le piétinement des passants ; dans le grand silence du froid, des voix d'enfants seules montaient, le tapage d'une bande de gamins, qui avaient établi une grande glissade, le long du ruisseau de la maréchalerie. Elle allait parfois à un des carreaux de la porte, enlevait de la main la buée, regardait ce que devenait le quartier par cette sacrée température ; mais pas un nez ne s'allongeait hors des boutiques voisines, le quartier, emmitouflé de neige, semblait faire le gros dos ; et elle échangeait seulement un petit signe de tête avec la charbonnière d'à côté, qui se promenait tête nue, la bouche fendue d'une oreille à l'autre, depuis qu'il gelait si fort.","However, winter had come, the fourth winter that the Coupeaus had spent in the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or. That year, December and January were particularly hard. It was freezing cold. After New Year's Day, the snow lay on the street for three weeks without melting. That didn't prevent work, on the contrary, because winter is the best season for ironers. It was pretty good in the shop! You never saw icicles on the windows, like at the grocer's and the hosier's opposite. The mechanics, stuffed with coke, kept up the heat of a bathtub there; the linens were smoking, you would have thought you were in the middle of summer; and we were fine, the doors closed, feeling hot everywhere, so hot that we would have ended up sleeping, with our eyes open. Gervaise said with a laugh that she imagined herself to be in the country. Indeed, the cars no longer made noise while driving on the snow; you could hardly hear the footsteps of passers-by; in the great silence of the cold, only children's voices rose, the uproar of a band of youngsters, who had set up a big slide along the farriery stream. Sometimes she went to one of the panes of the door, wiped the mist from her hand, looked at what was happening to the neighborhood in this goddamn temperature; but not a nose stuck out from the neighboring shops, the neighborhood, muffled in snow, seemed to be hunkering down; and she only exchanged a little nod with the great tit next door, who was walking about bareheaded, her mouth slit from ear to ear, since it was freezing so hard.","Winter had come, the fourth winter that the Coupeaus had spent in La Rue de la Goutte-d'Or. This year December and January were especially severe, and after New Year's the snow lay three weeks in the street without melting. There was plenty of work for Gervaise, and her shop was delightfully warm and singularly quiet, for the carriages made no noise in the snow-covered streets. The laughs and shouts of the children were almost the only sounds; they had made a long slide and enjoyed themselves hugely.","Meanwhile winter had come, the Coupeaus’ fourth winter in the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or. December and January were particularly cold. It froze hard as it well could. After New Year’s day the snow remained three weeks without melting. It did not interfere with work, but the contrary, for winter is the best season for the ironers. It was very pleasant inside the shop! There was never any ice on the window-panes like there was at the grocer’s and the hosier’s opposite. The stove was always stuffed with coke and kept things as hot as a Turkish bath. With the laundry steaming overhead you could almost imagine it was summer. You were quite comfortable with the doors closed and so much warmth everywhere that you were tempted to doze off with your eyes open. Gervaise laughed and said it reminded her of summer in the country. The street traffic made no noise in the snow and you could hardly hear the pedestrians who passed by. Only children’s voices were heard in the silence, especially the noisy band of urchins who had made a long slide in the gutter near the blacksmith’s shop. Gervaise would sometimes go over to the door, wipe the moisture from one of the panes with her hand, and look out to see what was happening to her neighborhood due to this extraordinary cold spell. Not one nose was being poked out of the adjacent shops. The entire neighborhood was muffled in snow. The only person she was able to exchange nods with was the coal-dealer next door, who still walked out bare-headed despite the severe freeze."
"Gervaise, lentement, recula. Elle s'était appuyée un instant à une étagère, et voyant madame Lorilleux lui examiner les mains, elle les ouvrit toutes grandes, les montra, disant de sa voix molle, sans se fâcher, en femme tombée qui accepte tout :","Gervaise slowly backed away. She had leaned against a shelf for a moment, and seeing Madame Lorilleux examine her hands, she opened them wide, showed them, saying in her soft voice, without getting angry, like a fallen woman who accepts everything:","Gervaise drew back. She leaned against the étagère for a moment and, seeing that her sister-in-law's eyes were fixed on her hands, she opened them and said in a gentle, weary voice—the voice of a woman who had ceased to struggle:","Gervaise slowly drew back. For a moment she leant against a rack, and seeing that Madame Lorilleux was looking at her hands, she opened them and showed them, saying softly, without the least anger, like a fallen women who accepts anything:"
"- Tu es propre, ma fille, tu as de jolis mots ! Je rapporterai ça à ton père, nous verrons si ça lui plaira.","- You are clean, my daughter, you have pretty words! I'll take this to your father, we'll see if he likes it.","""Did you know,"" said Leonie as she picked up a rose leaf with her pincers, ""how wretched poor Caroline is with that fellow who used to call for her regularly every night?""",Madame Lerat had to display severity over the muffled laughter.
"- Moi, je m'abonne, murmura-t-il, pour qu'on me fasse comme ça pipi dans la bouche.","- Me, I subscribe, he murmured, so that they make me pee in my mouth like that.","Gervaise devoured large slices of the breast, hardly speaking, but a little ashamed of her own gluttony in the presence of Goujet.",None were so agreeable in company as retired soldiers.
"- Là-dedans, il y a la poitrine d'un homme !","- In there, there is the chest of a man!","""The only wear for a man, I tell you!""","He drew himself up in his rags, in full view, and struck his blouse, roaring: “There’s a man’s chest under that!”"
"- Ah ! quand vous l'empêcherez de se miner, par exemple ! dit Coupeau la bouche pleine. Si vous n'étiez pas là, je parie qu'elle se lèverait pour me couper mon pain ? Tiens-toi donc sur le dos, grosse dinde ! Faut pas te démolir, autrement tu en as pour quinze jours à te remettre sur tes pattes ? Il est très bon, ton ragoût. Madame va en manger avec moi. N'est-ce pas, madame ?","- Oh! when you prevent it from getting undermined, for example! said Coupeau with his mouth full. If you weren't here, I bet she'd get up to cut my bread? Stand on your back, big turkey! Do not tear yourself down, otherwise you have two weeks to get back on your feet? It's very good, your stew. Madam will eat some with me. Isn't it, lady?","""It is lucky you are here, or she would be up and cutting my bread for me,"" said Coupeau.","“Ah! if only you could stop her from wearing herself out!” said Coupeau with his mouth full. “If you were not here, I’d bet she’d get up to cut my bread. Keep on your back, you big goose! You mustn’t move about, otherwise it’ll be a fortnight before you’ll be able to stand on your legs. Your stew’s very good. Madame will eat some with me, won’t you, Madame?”"
"- Dis donc ! le forgeron te fait de l'œil, s'écria Coupeau en riant, quand il apprit l'histoire. Oh ! je suis bien tranquille, il est trop godiche ? On le lui rendra, son argent. Mais, vrai, s'il avait affaire à de la fripouille, il serait joliment jobardé.","- Hey ! the blacksmith is eyeing you, cried Coupeau, laughing, when he heard the story. Oh ! I'm very quiet, is he too silly? We'll give it back to him, his money. But, true, if he had to deal with a scoundrel, he would be nicely fooled.","Finally it was agreed she should have five hundred francs and should return the money by paying each month twenty francs on account. ""Well, well!"" cried Coupeau as he heard of this financial transaction. ""We are in luck. There is no danger with us, to be sure, but if he were dealing with knaves he might never see hide or hair of his cash again!""","“I say, the blacksmith’s sweet on you,” exclaimed Coupeau, laughing, when he heard what had taken place. “Oh, I’m quite easy; he’s too big a muff. We’ll pay him back his money. But, really, if he had to deal with some people, he’d find himself pretty well duped.”"
- Elles sont rien drôles ! dit la voix enrouée d'une laveuse.,- They're nothing funny! said the hoarse voice of a washerwoman.,"""What fun!"" said one of the laundresses as she looked on at a safe distance. The whole lavatory were immensely amused, and the women applauded as if at a theater.",“They look jolly funny!” said the hoarse voice of one of the women.
"- Ah ! tu sais, baise cadet ! ? Garçon, deux litres de vieille !","- Oh! you know, fuck cadet! ? Boy, two liters of old!",Alas!,"“Come, let’s have no more of that, my boy! Waiter, two quarts of your aged stuff!”"
"- Madame jugera, dit-il en se tournant vers la jeune femme.","- Madame will judge, he said, turning to the young woman.","he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","“Madame will be judge,” said he, turning towards the young woman."
"Elle alla au Mont-de-Piété, pourtant. Quand elle revint, au bout d'une demi-heure, elle posa une pièce de cent sous sur la cheminée, en joignant la reconnaissance aux autres, entre les deux flambeaux.","She went to the Mont-de-Piété, however. When she returned, after half an hour, she placed a five-franc piece on the mantelpiece, joining the gratitude to the others, between the two candles.","She went to the Mont-de-Piété, and when she returned a half-hour later she laid a silver five-franc piece on the mantelshelf and placed the ticket with the others between the two candlesticks.","She went to the pawn-place, however. When she returned at the end of half an hour, she laid a hundred sou piece on the mantel-shelf, and added the ticket to the others, between the two candlesticks."
"- Il faut pourtant que je me couche, murmura-t-elle. Je ne puis pas retourner coucher dans la rue ? Oh ! je lui passerai plutôt sur le corps.","- I must go to bed, however, she murmured. I can't go back to sleep on the street? Oh ! I would rather pass over his body.","""What am I to do?"" she said piteously. ""I can't stay here!""","“Oh, I must get into that bed,” murmured she. “I can’t go and sleep in the street. Oh! I’ll crawl into it foot first.”"
"- Maintenant, il faudrait un légume ?","- Now, we need a vegetable?","""We have said nothing of vegetables,"" she said quietly.","“Now, don’t we need a vegetable?”"
"- Va donc ! C'est las de rouler la province, ça n'avait pas douze ans que ça servait de paillasse à soldats, ça a laissé une jambe dans son pays ? Elle est tombée de pourriture, sa jambe ?","- Go then ! It's tired of rolling the province, it hadn't been used as a mattress for soldiers for twelve years, it left a leg in its country? She fell from rotting, her leg?","The other continued: ""She got tired of the country, it seems, but she left one leg behind her, at all events.""",“Get out! This girl’s tired of wallowing about in the country; she wasn’t twelve years old when the soldiers were at her. She even lost her leg serving her country. That leg’s rotting off.”
"Et il lança un dernier coup de fouet qui atteignit Lalie au visage. La lèvre supérieure fut fendue, le sang coula. Gervaise avait pris une chaise, voulait tomber sur le serrurier. Mais la petite tendait vers elle des mains suppliantes, disait que ce n'était rien, que c'était fini. Elle épongeait le sang avec le coin de son tablier, et faisait taire ses enfants qui pleuraient à gros sanglots, comme s'ils avaient reçu la dégelée de coups de fouet.","And he launched a final whiplash that hit Lalie in the face. The upper lip was split, blood flowed. Gervaise had taken a chair, wanted to run into the locksmith. But the child held out pleading hands towards her, saying that it was nothing, that it was over. She mopped up the blood with the corner of her apron, and silenced her children, who were crying loudly, as if they had received the defrost from whippings.","And with another adroit movement he cut Lalie across the face. The blood gushed from her lip. Gervaise snatched a chair and flew at the brute, but the little girl held her skirts and said it did not hurt much; it would be over soon, and she washed the blood away, speaking gently to the frightened children.","And he gave a final lash with the whip which caught Lalie across the face. The upper lip was cut, the blood flowed. Gervaise had seized a chair, and was about to fall on to the locksmith; but the child held her hands towards her imploringly, saying that it was nothing and that it was all over. She wiped away the blood with the corner of her apron and quieted the babies, who were sobbing bitterly, as though they had received all the blows."
"Gervaise, les dents serrées, le poussa, en disant :","Gervaise, her teeth clenched, pushed him, saying:",Gervaise pushed him aside and walked up to Nana and gave her two cuffs on her ears.,"Gervaise, whose teeth were tight set, pushed him aside, exclaiming, “Shut up."
"C'étaient les boules qui devenaient des rats. Ces sales animaux grossissaient, passaient à travers le filet, sautaient sur le matelas, où ils s'évaporaient. Il y avait aussi un singe, qui sortait du mur, qui rentrait dans le mur, en s'approchant chaque fois si près de lui, qu'il reculait, de peur d'avoir le nez croqué. Brusquement, ça changea encore ; les murs devaient cabrioler, car il répétait, étranglé de terreur et de rage :","It was the balls that became rats. These dirty animals grew bigger, passed through the net, jumped on the mattress, where they evaporated. There was also a monkey, which came out of the wall, which re-entered the wall, approaching each time so close to it that it recoiled for fear of having its nose bitten off. Suddenly it changed again; the walls must have cavorted, for he kept repeating, choked with terror and rage:","The balls had been transformed to rats. The vile beasts found their way through the meshes of the nets and swarmed over the mattress and then disappeared as suddenly as they came. The rats were followed by a monkey, who went in and came out from the wall, each time so near his face that Coupeau started back in disgust.","There were black balls that were changing into rats. These filthy animals got fatter and fatter, then they jumped onto the mattress and disappeared. There was also a monkey which came out of the wall, and went back into the wall, and which approached so near him each time, that he drew back through fear of having his nose bitten off. Suddenly there was another change, the walls were probably cutting capers, for he yelled out, choking with terror and rage:"
Et il posa la bière qui eut un craquement de boîte neuve.,"And he put down the beer, which sounded like a new can.","""I beg you pardon,"" he said, ""but I thought it was for you,"" and he was turning to go away.","And he laid down the coffin, which creaked like a new box."
"Et Gervaise, très rouge, se rassit, leva les pieds, fit voir qu'il n'y avait rien. Coupeau avait ouvert la porte en criant : Bonsoir ! d'une voix brusque. Il l'appela, du corridor. Alors, elle sortit à son tour, après avoir balbutié une phrase de politesse : elle espérait bien qu'on se reverrait et qu'on s'entendrait tous ensemble. Mais les Lorilleux s'étaient déjà remis à l'ouvrage, au fond du trou noir de l'atelier, où la petite forge luisait, comme un dernier charbon blanchissant dans la grosse chaleur d'un four. La femme, un coin de la chemise glissé sur l'épaule, la peau rougie par le reflet du brasier, tirait un nouveau fil, gonflait à chaque effort son cou, dont les muscles se roulaient, pareils à des ficelles. Le mari, courbé sous la lueur verte de la boule d'eau, recommençant un bout de chaîne, ployait la maille à la pince, la serrait d'un côté, l'introduisait dans la maille supérieure, la rouvrait à l'aide d'une pointe, continuellement, mécaniquement, sans perdre un geste pour essuyer la sueur de sa face.","And Gervaise, very red, sat down again, raised her feet, showed that there was nothing. Coupeau had opened the door, shouting: Good evening! in a sharp voice. He called her from the corridor. So she went out in her turn, after stammering a polite phrase: she really hoped that we would see each other again and that we would all get along together. But the Lorilleuxs had already gone back to work, at the bottom of the black hole of the workshop, where the little forge gleamed like a last coal whitening in the great heat of an oven. The woman, a corner of her shirt slipped over her shoulder, her skin reddened by the reflection of the blaze, pulled a new thread, swelled her neck with each effort, the muscles of which twisted like strings. The husband, bent under the green glow of the ball of water, starting over a piece of the chain, bent the link with the pliers, tightened it on one side, introduced it into the upper link, reopened it with the help of a point, continuously, mechanically, without losing a gesture to wipe the sweat from his face.","Gervaise, indignant and scarlet, reseated herself and held up her shoes for examination. Coupeau opened the door with a gay good night, and she followed him into the corridor after a word or two of polite farewell. The Lorilleuxs turned to their work at the end of their room where the tiny forge still glittered. The woman with her chemise slipped off her shoulder which was red with the reflection from the brazier, was drawing out another wire, the muscles in her throat swelling with her exertions. The husband, stooping under the green light of the ball of water, was again busy with his pincers, not stopping even to wipe the sweat from his brow.","And Gervaise, turning very red, sat down again, and holding up her feet showed that there was nothing clinging to them. Coupeau had opened the door, exclaiming: “Good-night!” in an abrupt tone of voice. He called to her from the corridor. Then she in her turn went off, after stammering a few polite words: she hoped to see them again, and that they would all agree well together. Both of the Lorilleux had already gone back to their work at the far end of their dark hole of a work-room. Madame Lorilleux, her skin reflecting the red glow from the bed of coals, was drawing on another wire, each effort swelling her neck and making the strained muscles stand out like taut cords. Her husband, hunched over beneath the greenish gleam of the globe was starting another length of chain, twisting each link with his pliers, pressing it on one side, inserting it into the next link above, opening it again with the pointed tool, continuously, mechanically, not wasting a motion, even to wipe the sweat from his face."
"Et il regardait le visage de Gervaise, rougi par les larmes. Quand il vit que le lit n'était pas défait, il hocha doucement la tête ; puis, il vint jusqu'à la couchette des enfants qui dormaient toujours avec leurs mines roses de chérubins ; et, baissant la voix :","And he looked at Gervaise's face, red with tears. When he saw that the bed wasn't unmade, he nodded gently; then he came to the bunk of the children who were still sleeping with their rosy faces of cherubs; and, lowering his voice:","As he spoke he looked closely at Gervaise; he saw her eyes were red with tears and then, glancing at the bed, discovered that it had not been disturbed. He shook his head and, going toward the couch where the children lay with their rosy cherub faces, he said in a lower voice:","And he looked at Gervaise’s face, red with weeping. When he saw that the bed had not been slept in, he shook his head gently; then he went to the children’s couch where they were sleeping, looking as rosy as cherubs, and, lowering his voice, he said,"
- Et l'or ? demanda Gervaise à demi-voix.,- What about gold? asked Gervaise in a low voice.,"""And the gold?"" asked Gervaise softly.",“And the gold?” asked Gervaise in a low voice.
"- Ah ! voilà la musique ! s'écria Lantier furieux. Je vous avertis, je reprends la porte, moi ! Et je file pour tout de bon, cette fois ? Vous ne voulez pas vous taire ? Bonsoir ! je retourne d'où je viens.","- Oh! here is the music! exclaimed Lantier furiously. I'm warning you, I'm going back to the door! And I'm off for good this time? You don't want to be silent? Good evening ! I'm going back where I come from.","""Well, this is lovely music!"" cried Lantier furiously. ""I warn you, if you don't all stop, that out of this door I go, and you won't see me again in a hurry! Will you hold your tongue? Good-by then; I'll go back where I came from.""","“Ah! there’s the music!” shouted Lantier furiously. “I warn you, I’ll take my hook! And it will be for good, this time. You won’t shut up? Then, good morning! I’ll return to the place I’ve just come from.”"
"Quatre hommes finirent par transporter Coupeau chez un pharmacien, au coin de la rue des Poissonniers ; et il demeura là près d'une heure, au milieu de la boutique, sur une couverture, pendant qu'on était allé chercher un brancard à l'hôpital Lariboisière. Il respirait encore, mais le pharmacien avait de petits hochements de tête. Maintenant, Gervaise, à genoux par terre, sanglotait d'une façon continue, barbouillée de ses larmes, aveuglée, hébétée. D'un mouvement machinal, elle avançait les mains, tâtait les membres de son mari, très doucement. Puis, elle les retirait, en regardant le pharmacien qui lui avait défendu de toucher ; et elle recommençait quelques secondes plus tard, ne pouvant s'empêcher de s'assurer s'il restait chaud, croyant lui faire du bien. Quand le brancard arriva enfin, et qu'on parla de partir pour l'hôpital, elle se releva, en disant violemment :","Four men ended up taking Coupeau to a chemist at the corner of the rue des Poissonniers; and he remained there for nearly an hour, in the middle of the shop, on a blanket, while they went to fetch a stretcher from the Lariboisière hospital. He was still breathing, but the pharmacist nodded slightly. Now Gervaise, on her knees on the ground, sobbed continuously, smeared with her tears, blinded, stupefied. With a mechanical movement, she put her hands out, feeling her husband's limbs, very gently. Then she took them off, looking at the pharmacist who had forbidden her to touch them; and she would start again a few seconds later, not being able to prevent herself from making sure that he was still warm, thinking he was doing him good. When the stretcher finally arrived, and there was talk of leaving for the hospital, she got up, saying violently:","Four men bore Coupeau to a druggist's at the corner, where he lay for an hour while a litter was sent for from the Hospital Lariboisiere. He was breathing still, but that was all. Gervaise knelt at his side, hysterically sobbing. Every minute or two, in spite of the prohibition of the druggist, she touched him to see if he were still warm. When the litter arrived and they spoke of the hospital, she started up, saying violently:","Four men ended by carrying Coupeau into a chemist’s, at the corner of the Rue des Poissonniers; and he remained there on a blanket, in the middle of the shop, whilst they sent to the Lariboisiere Hospital for a stretcher. He was still breathing. Gervaise, sobbing, was kneeling on the floor beside him, her face smudged with tears, stunned and unseeing. Her hands would reach to feel her husband’s limbs with the utmost gentleness. Then she would draw back as she had been warned not to touch him. But a few seconds later she would touch him to assure herself that he was still warm, feeling somehow that she was helping him. When the stretcher at length arrived, and they talked of starting for the hospital, she got up, saying violently:"
"Cependant, Goujet s'était arrêté devant une des machines à rivets. Il restait là, songeur, la tête basse, les regards fixes. La machine forgeait des rivets de quarante millimètres, avec une aisance tranquille de géante. Et rien n'était plus simple en vérité. Le chauffeur prenait le bout de fer dans le fourneau ; le frappeur le plaçait dans la clouière, qu'un filet d'eau continu arrosait pour éviter d'en détremper l'acier ; et c'était fait, la vis s'abaissait, le boulon sautait à terre, avec sa tête ronde comme coulée au moule. En douze heures, cette sacrée mécanique en fabriquait des centaines de kilogrammes. Goujet n'avait pas de méchanceté ; mais, à certains moments, il aurait volontiers pris Fifine pour taper dans toute cette ferraille, par colère de lui voir des bras plus solides que les siens. Ça lui causait un gros chagrin, même quand il se raisonnait, en se disant que la chair ne pouvait pas lutter contre le fer. Un jour, bien sûr, la machine tuerait l'ouvrier ; déjà leurs journées étaient tombées de douze francs à neuf francs, et on parlait de les diminuer encore ; enfin, elles n'avaient rien de gai, ces grosses bêtes, qui faisaient des rivets et des boulons comme elles auraient fait de la saucisse. Il regarda celle-là trois bonnes minutes sans rien dire ; ses sourcils se fronçaient, sa belle barbe jaune avait un hérissement de menace. Puis, un air de douceur et de résignation amollit peu à peu ses traits. Il se tourna vers Gervaise qui se serrait contre lui, il dit avec un sourire triste :","However, Goujet had stopped in front of one of the rivet machines. He stood there, thoughtful, head down, staring. The machine forged forty-millimetre rivets with a giant's quiet ease. And nothing could be simpler in truth. The fireman took the piece of iron from the furnace; the striker placed it in the nail pit, which a continuous trickle of water sprinkled to avoid soaking the steel; and it was done, the screw lowered, the bolt jumped to the ground, with its round head as though cast in the mould. In twelve hours, this sacred machine produced hundreds of kilograms. Goujet had no malice; but, at certain moments, he would gladly have taken Fifine to kick all that scrap metal, out of anger at seeing her arms stronger than his. It caused him great grief, even when he reasoned with himself, telling himself that flesh could not fight against iron. One day, of course, the machine would kill the worker; their days had already fallen from twelve francs to nine francs, and there was talk of reducing them still further; in short, there was nothing gay about them, these big beasts, which made rivets and bolts as they would have made sausage. He looked at that one for three good minutes without saying anything; his eyebrows were furrowed, his beautiful yellow beard had a menacing bristle. Then, an air of gentleness and resignation gradually softened his features. He turned to Gervaise who was hugging him, he said with a sad smile:","In this way she had paid half the money she had borrowed, when one quarter day, not knowing to whom to turn, as she had not been able to collect her bills punctually, she ran to the Goujets' and borrowed the amount of her rent from them.","Goujet had stopped before one of the rivet machines. He stood there brooding, his head lowered, his gaze fixed. This machine forged forty millimetre rivets with the calm ease of a giant. Nothing could be simpler. The stoker took the iron shank from the furnace; the striker put it into the socket, where a continuous stream of water cooled it to prevent softening of the steel. The press descended and the bolt flew out onto the ground, its head as round as though cast in a mold. Every twelve hours this machine made hundreds of kilograms of bolts! Goujet was not a mean person, but there were moments when he wanted to take Fifine and smash this machine to bits because he was angry to see that its arms were stronger than his own. He reasoned with himself, telling himself that human flesh cannot compete with steel. But he was still deeply hurt. The day would come when machinery would destroy the skilled worker. Their day’s pay had already fallen from twelve francs to nine francs. There was talk of cutting it again. He stared at it, frowning, for three minutes without saying a word. His yellow beard seemed to bristle defiantly. Then, gradually an expression of resignation came over his face and he turned toward Gervaise who was clinging tightly to him and said with a sad smile:"
"Quand le printemps revint, Lantier, tout à fait de la maison, parla d'habiter le quartier, afin d'être plus près de ses amis. Il voulait une chambre meublée dans une maison propre. Madame Boche, Gervaise elle-même, se mirent en quatre pour lui trouver ça. On fouilla les rues voisines. Mais il était trop difficile, il désirait une grande cour, il demandait un rez-de-chaussée, enfin toutes les commodités imaginables. Et maintenant, chaque soir, chez les Coupeau, il semblait mesurer la hauteur des plafonds, étudier la distribution des pièces, convoiter un logement pareil. Oh ! il n'aurait pas demandé autre chose, il se serait volontiers creusé un trou dans ce coin tranquille et chaud. Puis, il terminait chaque fois son examen par cette phrase :","When spring returned, Lantier, quite at home, talked of living in the quarter, in order to be nearer to his friends. He wanted a furnished room in a clean house. Madame Boche, Gervaise herself, bent over backwards to find him that. We searched the neighboring streets. But he was too picky, he wanted a big yard, he wanted a ground floor, well, every conceivable convenience. And now, every evening, at the Coupeaus', he seemed to measure the height of the ceilings, to study the distribution of the rooms, to covet such a dwelling. Oh ! he wouldn't have asked for anything else, he would gladly have dug himself a hole in this quiet, warm corner. Then, he ended his examination each time with this sentence:","When spring came Lantier began to talk of moving into that neighborhood. He wanted a furnished, clean room. Mme Boche and Gervaise tried to find one for him. But they did not meet with any success. He was altogether too fastidious in his requirements. Every evening at the Coupeaus' he wished he could find people like themselves who would take a lodger. ""You are very comfortable here, I am sure,"" he would say regularly. Finally one night when he had uttered this phrase, as usual, Coupeau cried out:","When spring came, Lantier, who was now quite one of the family, talked of living in the neighborhood, so as to be nearer his friends. He wanted a furnished room in a decent house. Madame Boche, and even Gervaise herself went searching about to find it for him. They explored the neighboring streets. But he was always too difficult to please; he required a big courtyard, a room on the ground floor; in fact, every luxury imaginable. And then every evening, at the Coupeaus’, he seemed to measure the height of the ceilings, study the arrangement of the rooms, and covet a similar lodging. Oh, he would never have asked for anything better, he would willingly have made himself a hole in that warm, quiet corner. Then each time he wound up his inspection with these words:"
"Il ne répondit pas, et elle répéta sur un ton navrant d'agonie :","He did not answer, and she repeated in a heartrending tone of agony:","He did not answer, and she repeated her words in a tone of agony.","He did not answer, and she repeated, in a tone of despairing agony: “Is that all I get from you?”"
"Elle luttait, elle disait non de la tête, énergiquement. Dans son trouble, comme pour montrer qu'elle resterait là, elle se déshabillait, jetait sa robe de soie sur une chaise, se mettait violemment en chemise et en jupon, toute blanche, le cou et les bras nus. Son lit était à elle, n'est-ce pas ? elle voulait coucher dans son lit. A deux reprises, elle tenta encore de trouver un coin propre et de passer. Mais Lantier ne se lassait pas, la prenait à la taille, en disant des choses pour lui mettre le feu dans le sang. Ah ! elle était bien plantée, avec un loupiat de mari par-devant, qui l'empêchait de se fourrer honnêtement sous sa couverture, avec un sacré salaud d'homme par derrière, qui songeait uniquement à profiter de son malheur pour la ravoir ! Comme le chapelier haussait la voix, elle le supplia de se taire. Et elle écouta, l'oreille tendue vers le cabinet où couchaient Nana et maman Coupeau. La petite et la vieille devaient dormir, on entendait une respiration forte.","She struggled, she shook her head no, energetically. In her confusion, as if to show that she would stay there, she undressed, threw her silk dress on a chair, violently put on her shirt and petticoat, all white, her neck and arms bare. Her bed was hers, right? she wanted to sleep in her bed. Twice she tried again to find a clean corner and pass. But Lantier never tired, took her by the waist, saying things to set her blood on fire. Ah! she was well planted, with a burly husband in front, which prevented her from crawling honestly under her blanket, with a bloody bastard of a man behind, who thought only of taking advantage of his misfortune to get her back! As the hatter raised his voice, she begged him to be quiet. And she listened, her ear straining towards the closet where Nana and Maman Coupeau slept. The little one and the old one must have been sleeping, you could hear heavy breathing.","He put his arm around her waist and pointed to her husband as he lay snoring, with his mouth wide open. ""Leave me!"" said Gervaise, imploringly, and she pointed to the room where her mother-in-law and Nana slept.","“No,” she replied firmly, shaking her head vigorously. Then, to show that she would remain where she was, she began to take off her clothes, throwing her silk dress over a chair. She was quickly in only her chemise and petticoat. Well, it was her own bed. She wanted to sleep in her own bed and made two more attempts to reach a clean corner of the bed. Lantier, having no intention of giving up, whispered things to her. What a predicament she was in, with a louse of a husband that prevented her from crawling under her own blankets and a low skunk behind her just waiting to take advantage of the situation to possess her again. She begged Lantier to be quiet. Turning toward the small room where Nana and mother Coupeau slept, she listened anxiously. She could hear only steady breathing."
"Madame Lerat, pour donner l'exemple, arrivait la première. Puis, la porte battait pendant un quart d'heure, tous les petits bonnichons de fleuristes entraient à la débandade, suantes, décoiffées. Un matin de juillet, Nana se présenta la dernière, ce qui d'ailleurs était assez dans ses habitudes.","Madame Lerat, to set an example, arrived first. Then, the door banged for a quarter of an hour, all the little florists' bonnichons came scurrying in, sweating, disheveled. One morning in July, Nana showed up last, which, by the way, was pretty much her habit.","Mme Lerat was the first to make her appearance in the morning, but in another fifteen minutes all the others were there. One morning in July Nana came in last, which, however, was the usual case.","Madame Lerat arrived the first, in view of setting an example. Then for a quarter of an hour the door swayed to and fro, and all the workgirls scrambled in, perspiring with tumbled hair. One July morning Nana arrived the last, as very often happened."
"Mais, tout d'un coup, il ronfla. Alors, Gervaise eut un soupir de soulagement, heureuse de le savoir enfin en repos, cuvant sa soûlographie sur deux bons matelas. Et elle parla dans le silence, d'une voix lente et continue, sans quitter des yeux le petit fer à tuyauter, qu'elle maniait vivement.","But suddenly he snored. Then Gervaise heaved a sigh of relief, happy to know he was finally at rest, sleeping off his drunkenness on two good mattresses. And she spoke in silence, in a slow and continuous voice, without taking her eyes off the little pipe iron, which she handled briskly.","Suddenly he began to snore, and Gervaise uttered a sigh of relief. She used her fluting iron for a minute and then said quietly:","But, all on a sudden, he snored. Then Gervaise gave a sigh of relief, happy in knowing that he was at length quiet, and sleeping off his intoxication on two good mattresses. And she spoke out in the silence, in a slow and continuous voice, without taking her eyes off her work."
- C'est bien ici pourtant que M. Goujet travaille ?,- Is it really here that Mr. Goujet works?,"""Is it here that Monsieur Goujet works?""","“But yet it’s here that Monsieur Goujet works, isn’t it?”"
"Dans le quartier, la nouvelle boutique produisit une grosse émotion. On accusa les Coupeau d'aller trop vite et de faire des embarras. Ils avaient, en effet, dépensé les cinq cents francs des Goujet en installation, sans garder même de quoi vivre une quinzaine, comme ils se l'étaient promis. Le matin où Gervaise enleva ses volets pour la première fois, elle avait juste six francs dans son porte-monnaie. Mais elle n'était pas en peine, les pratiques arrivaient, ses affaires s'annonçaient très bien. Huit jours plus tard, le samedi, avant de se coucher, elle resta deux heures à calculer, sur un bout de papier ; et elle réveilla Coupeau, la mine luisante, pour lui dire qu'il y avait des mille et des cents à gagner, si l'on était raisonnable.","In the district, the new shop produced a great emotion. The Coupeaus were accused of going too fast and making trouble. They had, in fact, spent the Goujets' five hundred francs on settling down, without even keeping enough to live on for a fortnight, as they had promised each other. The morning Gervaise took down her shutters for the first time, she had just six francs in her purse. But she was not in trouble, the practices were coming, her business was looking very good. Eight days later, on Saturday, before going to bed, she spent two hours calculating on a piece of paper; and she woke Coupeau, her face shining, to tell him that there were thousands and hundreds to be gained, if one were reasonable.","The new shop created a great excitement in the neighborhood. Some people declared that the Coupeaus were on the road to ruin; they had, in fact, spent the whole five hundred francs and were penniless, contrary to their intentions. The morning that Gervaise first took down her shutters she had only six francs in the world, but she was not troubled, and at the end of a week she told her husband after two hours of abstruse calculations that they had taken in enough to cover their expenses.","In the neighborhood the new shop produced a great sensation. The Coupeaus were accused of going too fast, and making too much fuss. They had, in fact, spent the five hundred francs lent by the Goujets in fitting up the shop and in moving, without keeping sufficient to live upon for a fortnight, as they had intended doing. The morning that Gervaise took down her shutters for the first time, she had just six francs in her purse. But that did not worry her, customers began to arrive, and things seemed promising. A week later on the Saturday, before going to bed, she remained two hours making calculations on a piece of paper, and she awoke Coupeau to tell him, with a bright look on her face, that there were hundreds and thousands of francs to be made, if they were only careful. “Ah, well!”"
"Elle se tut, cachant Nana dans sa jupe, craignant un cri de la petite. Malgré elle, toute pâle, elle regardait. Justement, Coupeau soudait le bord extrême de la feuille, près de la gouttière ; il se coulait le plus possible, ne pouvait atteindre le bout. Alors, il se risqua, avec ces mouvements ralentis des ouvriers, pleins d'aisance et de lourdeur. Un moment, il fut au-dessus du pavé, ne se tenant plus, tranquille, à son affaire ; et, d'en bas, sous le fer promené d'une main soigneuse, on voyait grésiller la petite flamme blanche de la soudure. Gervaise, muette, la gorge étranglée par l'angoisse, avait serré les mains, les élevait d'un geste machinal de supplication. Mais elle respira bruyamment, Coupeau venait de remonter sur le toit, sans se presser, en prenant le temps de cracher une dernière fois dans la rue.","She was silent, hiding Nana in her skirt, fearing a cry from the little one. In spite of herself, quite pale, she watched. In fact, Coupeau was soldering the extreme edge of the sheet, near the gutter; he was sinking as much as possible, couldn't reach the end. So he ventured, with those slow movements of the workers, full of ease and heaviness. For a moment he was above the pavement, no longer keeping quiet about his business; and, from below, under the carefully moved iron, one could see the little white flame of the solder crackling. Gervaise, mute, her throat constricted with anguish, had clasped her hands, raising them with a mechanical gesture of supplication. But she breathed noisily, Coupeau had just climbed back up to the roof, without hurrying, taking the time to spit one last time in the street.","She looked up, keeping Nana behind her skirts, lest the child should call out and startle her father, who was at that moment on the extreme edge. She saw the soldering iron and the tiny flame that rose as he carefully passed it along the edges of the zinc. Gervaise, pale with suspense and fear, raised her hands mechanically with a gesture of supplication. Coupeau ascended the steep roof with a slow step, then glancing down, he beheld his wife.","And she left off speaking, hiding Nana in her skirt, fearing a cry from the little one. Very pale, she looked up in spite of herself. At that moment Coupeau was soldering the extreme edge of the sheet close to the gutter; he slid down as far as possible, but without being able to reach the edge. Then, he risked himself with those slow movements peculiar to workmen. For an instant he was immediately over the pavement, no long holding on, all absorbed in his work; and, from below, one could see the little white flame of the solder frizzling up beneath the carefully wielded iron. Gervaise, speechless, her throat contracted with anguish, had clasped her hands together, and held them up in mechanical gesture of prayer. But she breathed freely as Coupeau got up and returned back along the roof, without hurrying himself, and taking the time to spit once more into the street."
"Gervaise avait gardé sa tranquillité souriante de la matinée. Depuis la promenade pourtant, elle devenait par moments toute triste, elle regardait son mari et les Lorilleux de son air pensif et raisonnable. Elle trouvait Coupeau lâche devant sa sœur. La veille encore, il criait fort, il jurait de les remettre à leur place, ces langues de vipères, s'ils lui manquaient. Mais en face d'eux, elle le voyait bien, il faisait le chien couchant, guettait sortir leurs paroles, était aux cent coups quand il les croyait fâchés. Et cela, simplement, inquiétait la jeune femme pour l'avenir.","Gervaise had retained her smiling tranquility of the morning. Since the walk, however, she had become very sad at times, she looked at her husband and the Lorilleuxs with her thoughtful and reasonable air. She found Coupeau cowardly in front of his sister. Just the day before, he was shouting loudly, he swore to put them back in their place, those tongues of vipers, if he missed them. But in front of them, she could see him clearly, he was lying down, waiting for their words to come out, was on the edge when he thought they were angry. And that, simply, worried the young woman for the future.","Gervaise had been calm and smiling all day, but she had quietly watched her husband with the Lorilleuxs. She thought Coupeau was afraid of his sister—cowardly, in fact. The evening previous he had said he did not care a sou for their opinion on any subject and that they had the tongues of vipers, but now he was with them, he was like a whipped hound, hung on their words and anticipated their wishes. This troubled his wife, for it augured ill, she thought, for their future happiness.","Gervaise had kept her smiling peacefulness from the morning, but after the long walk she appeared almost sad at times as she watched her husband and the Lorilleuxs in a thoughtful way. She had the feeling that Coupeau was a little afraid of his sister. The evening before, he had been talking big, swearing he would put them in their places if they didn’t behave. However, she could see that in their presence he was hanging on their words, worrying when he thought they might be displeased. This gave the young bride some cause for worry about the future."
"- Tiens ! vous êtes en course, dit-il en souriant faiblement ; vous rentrez chez vous ?","- Take ! you're in the race, he said, smiling weakly; you go back home ?","""Ah,"" he said with a wan smile, ""you are going home, I presume?""","“You have been on an errand,” he said, smiling. “And now you are on your way home.” Actually Gervaise had her back toward Rue des Poissonniers."
"Un samedi, elle eut joliment du mal. Il avait plu trois jours, les pieds des pratiques semblaient avoir apporté dans le magasin toute la boue du quartier. Virginie était au comptoir, en train de faire la dame, bien peignée, avec un petit col et des manches de dentelle. A côté d'elle, sur l'étroite banquette de moleskine rouge, Lantier se prélassait, l'air chez lui, comme le vrai patron de la baraque ; et il envoyait négligemment la main dans un bocal de pastilles à la menthe, histoire de croquer du sucre, par habitude.","One Saturday, she had a pretty bad time. It had rained for three days, the feet of the practices seemed to have brought all the mud from the neighborhood into the store. Virginie was at the counter, playing the lady, neatly combed, with a little collar and lace sleeves. Beside her, on the narrow red moleskin bench, Lantier was lounging, looking at home, like the real boss of the barracks; and he carelessly tossed his hand into a jar of breath mints, just to bite into the sugar, out of habit.","One Saturday Gervaise had hard work. It had rained for three days, and all the mud of the streets seemed to have been brought into the shop. Virginie stood behind the counter with collar and cuffs trimmed with lace. Near her on a low chair lounged Lantier, and he was, as usual, eating candy.","One Saturday she had a hard job of it. It had rained for three days and the customers seemed to have brought all the mud of the neighborhood into the shop on the soles of their boots. Virginie was at the counter doing the grand, with her hair well combed, and wearing a little white collar and a pair of lace cuffs. Beside her, on the narrow seat covered with red oil-cloth, Lantier did the dandy, looking for the world as if he were at home, as if he were the real master of the place, and from time to time he carelessly dipped his hand into a jar of peppermint drops, just to nibble something sweet according to his habit."
"- La charité, s'il vous plaît ?","- Charity, please?","""Charity, if you please!""","He held out his hand, and muttered in a low voice: “Charity, if you please!”"
"Puis, la voix lui manqua, il continua de taper sourdement, follement, raidi dans sa cotte et son bourgeron déguenillés, la face bleuie sous sa barbe sale, avec son front chauve taché de grandes plaques rouges. Sur le carré, les voisins disaient qu'il la battait parce qu'elle lui avait refusé vingt sous, le matin. On entendit la voix de Boche, au bas de l'escalier. Il appelait madame Boche, il lui criait :","Then, his voice failing him, he continued to type dully, madly, stiff in his ragged coat and smock, his face blued under his dirty beard, his bald forehead stained with large red patches. On the square, the neighbors said that he beat her because she had refused him twenty sous that morning. Boche's voice was heard at the bottom of the stairs. He called Madame Boche, he shouted to her:","On the floor lay the poor woman with her skirts drenched as she had come from the washtub, her hair streaming over her bloody face, uttering low groans at each kick the brute gave her. The neighbors whispered to each other that she had refused to give him the money she had earned that day. Boche called up the staircase to his wife:","Then when he could no longer speak, he madly continued to kick with a dull sound, rigid in his ragged blue blouse and overalls, his face turned purple beneath his dirty beard, and his bald forehead streaked with big red blotches. The neighbors on the landing related that he was beating her because she had refused him twenty sous that morning. Boche’s voice was heard at the foot of the staircase. He was calling Madame Boche, saying:"
"- Vous seriez si gentils ! ? Vous ne pouvez pas savoir ? Oui, j'en suis là, mon Dieu ! j'en suis là ?","- You would be so nice! ? Can't you know? Yes, I am there, my God! am I there?","I will, indeed! "" Tears were in her eyes, but she was determined not to say that she had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours. ""I can't tell you how much I need it,"" she continued.","“It would be kind of you! You don’t know. Yes, I’m reduced to that, good Lord—reduced to that!”"
"- On étouffe, murmura-t-elle en s'approchant d'une fenêtre comme pour baisser davantage la jalousie.","- We're suffocating, she murmured, approaching a window as if to lower her jealousy further.","""How warm it is!""","“It’s hot enough to make one stifle,” Nana said, approaching a window as if to draw the blind farther down; but she leant forward and again looked out both to the right and left."
"- Ah ! tu veux la grande lessive ? Donne ta peau, que j'en fasse des torchons !","- Oh! you want the big laundry? Give your skin, let me make tea towels!","Her voice also was hoarse and low. ""I will beat your skin,"" she muttered, ""as I would my coarse towels.""",“Ah! you want to wash. Let me get hold of your skin that I may beat it into dish-cloths!”
"Gervaise les contemplait l'un après l'autre, douce et stupide. D'abord, quand son mari avait poussé son ancien amant dans la boutique, elle s'était pris la tête entre les deux poings, du même geste instinctif que les jours de gros orage, à chaque coup de tonnerre. Ça ne lui semblait pas possible ; les murs allaient tomber et écraser tout le monde. Puis, en voyant les deux hommes assis, sans que même les rideaux de mousseline eussent bougé, elle avait subitement trouvé ces choses naturelles. L'oie la gênait un peu ; elle en avait trop mangé, décidément, et ça l'empêchait de penser. Une paresse heureuse l'engourdissait, la tenait tassée au bord de la table, avec le seul besoin de n'être pas embêtée. Mon Dieu ! à quoi bon se faire de la bile, lorsque les autres ne s'en font pas, et que les histoires paraissent s'arranger d'elles-mêmes, à la satisfaction générale ? Elle se leva pour aller voir s'il restait du café.","Gervaise gazed at them one after the other, gentle and stupid. First, when her husband had pushed his former lover into the shop, she had taken her head between her two fists, with the same instinctive gesture as on days of a heavy storm, with each clap of thunder. It didn't seem possible; the walls were going to fall and crush everyone. Then, seeing the two men seated, without even the muslin curtains having moved, she had suddenly found these things natural. The goose bothered her a little; she had eaten too much of it, decidedly, and that prevented her from thinking. A happy laziness numbed her, kept her huddled on the edge of the table, with the only need not to be bothered. My God ! what's the point of worrying about it, when the others don't, and the stories seem to work themselves out, to everyone's satisfaction? She got up to go see if there was any coffee left.","Gervaise looked from one to the other. She was literally dazed. When her husband first appeared with her former lover she had clasped her hands over her forehead with that instinctive gesture with which in a great storm one waits for the approach of the thunderclap. It did not seem possible that the walls would not fall and crush them all. Then seeing the two men calmly seated together, it all at once seemed perfectly natural to her. She was tired of thinking about it and preferred to accept it. Why, after all, should she worry? No one else did. Everyone seemed to be satisfied; why should not she be also?","Gervaise, feeling meek and stupid, looked at them one after the other. At first, when her husband pushed her old lover into the shop, she buried her head between her hands, the same as she instinctively did on stormy days at each clap of thunder. She could not believe it possible; the walls would fall in and crush them all. Then, when she saw the two sitting together peacefully, she suddenly accepted it as quite natural. A happy feeling of languor benumbed her, retained her all in a heap at the edge of the table, with the sole desire of not being bothered. Mon Dieu! what is the use of putting oneself out when others do not, and when things arrange themselves to the satisfaction of everybody? She got up to see if there was any coffee left."
"Il hochait la tête, en l'écoutant. Il l'approuvait, il ne pouvait pas dire le contraire. Brusquement, dans le grand jour, il la prit entre ses bras, la serra à l'écraser, lui posa un baiser furieux sur le cou, comme s'il avait voulu lui manger la peau. Puis, il la lâcha, sans demander autre chose ; et il ne parla plus de leur amour. Elle se secouait, elle ne se fâchait pas, comprenant que tous deux avaient bien gagné ce petit plaisir.","He nodded, listening to her. He approved of it, he couldn't say otherwise. Suddenly, in broad daylight, he took her in his arms, squeezed her crushingly, placed a furious kiss on her neck, as if he wanted to eat her skin. Then he released her, without asking for anything else; and he spoke no more of their love. She shook herself, she didn't get angry, realizing that both of them had earned this little pleasure.","He shook his head as he listened to her, but he felt she was right. Suddenly he snatched her in his arms and kissed her furiously once and then dropped her and turned abruptly away. She was not angry, but the locksmith trembled from head to foot.","He nodded his head as he listened. He agreed with her and was unable to offer any arguments. Suddenly he pulled her into his arms and kissed her, crushing her. Then he let her go and said nothing more about their love. She wasn’t angry. She felt they had earned that small moment of pleasure."
- Tonnerre de Dieu ! obéis-moi donc une fois ! Quand je te dis que je ne veux pas !,- Thunder of God! obey me once! When I tell you that I don't want to!,"""Confound you!"" he muttered. ""Will you never learn to obey? When I say a thing I mean it—""","“Just obey me, for once! I tell you I won’t have ’em touched!”"
"Cependant, elle avait pris le livre et effaçait les pièces d'un trait de plume. Tout y était bien. Quand elles réglèrent, elle vit que Gervaise lui comptait un bonnet six sous ; elle se récria, mais elle dut convenir qu'elle n'était vraiment pas chère pour le courant ; non, les chemises d'homme cinq sous, les pantalons de femme quatre sous, les taies d'oreiller un sou et demi, les tabliers un sou, ce n'était pas cher, attendu que bien des blanchisseuses prenaient deux liards ou même un sou de plus pour toutes ces pièces. Puis, lorsque Gervaise eut appelé le linge sale, que la vieille femme inscrivait, elle le fourra dans son panier, elle ne s'en alla pas, embarrassée, ayant aux lèvres une demande qui la gênait beaucoup.","However, she had taken the book and was erasing the pieces with the stroke of a pen. Everything was fine there. When they paid, she saw that Gervaise counted out a six-sou bonnet for her; she protested, but she had to admit that she really wasn't expensive for the current; no, men's shirts five sous, women's trousers four sous, pillowcases a sou and a half, aprons a sou, they were not expensive, considering that many laundresses took two farthings or even a penny more for all these parts. Then, when Gervaise had called for the dirty laundry, which the old woman was writing down, she stuffed it into her basket, she did not go away, embarrassed, having a request on her lips that greatly embarrassed her.",She took up her book and drew a pen through the pieces as she spoke. Everything was there. She brought out the bundle of soiled clothes. Gervaise put them in her basket and hesitated.,"She had taken out her notebook and was crossing off the various items. Everything was in order. She noticed that Gervaise was charging six sous for each bonnet. She protested, but had to agree that it was in line with present prices. Men’s shirts were five sous, women’s underdrawers four sous, pillow-cases a sou and a half, and aprons one sou. No, the prices weren’t high. Some laundresses charged a sou more for each item. Gervaise was now calling out the soiled clothes, as she packed them in her basket, for Madame Goujet to list. Then she lingered on, embarrassed by a request which she wished to make."
- On ferme ! on ferme ! crièrent les voix puissantes des gardiens.,- We are closing ! we are closing ! shouted the powerful voices of the guards.,"""Time to close the doors!""

Closing time!” called out the attendants, in a loud tone of voice."

Then he had a slight sign to say that he recognized the gentleman.,"The child looked away and did not answer, but when his mother repeated the question he made a little sign that he remembered him.",The child held down his head without replying.

I saw rats running all over the floor and the walls, and you were calling me, and I saw all sorts of horrible things! But I am all right now.

Just fancy, I saw rats and ran about on all fours to put a grain of salt under their tails. And you, you called to me, men were trying to kill you.

"Coupeau grognait, n'ayant même plus l'idée d'allonger des claques. Il perdait la boule, complètement.

He was losing his mind, completely.

"Quelle heureuse saison ! La blanchisseuse soignait d'une façon particulière sa pratique de la rue des Portes-Blanches ; elle lui reportait toujours son linge elle-même, parce que cette course, chaque vendredi, était un prétexte tout trouvé pour passer rue Marcadet et entrer à la forge. Dès qu'elle tournait le coin de la rue, elle se sentait légère, gaie, comme si elle faisait une partie de campagne, au milieu de ces terrains vagues, bordés d'usines grises ; la chaussée noire de charbon, les panaches de vapeur sur les toits, l'amusaient autant qu'un sentier de mousse dans un bois de la banlieue, s'enfonçant entre de grands bouquets de verdure ; et elle aimait l'horizon blafard, rayé par les hautes cheminées des fabriques, la butte Montmartre qui bouchait le ciel, avec ses maisons crayeuses, percées des trous réguliers de leurs fenêtres. Puis, elle ralentissait le pas en arrivant, sautant les flaques d'eau, prenant plaisir à traverser les coins déserts et embrouillés du chantier de démolitions. Au fond, la forge luisait, même en plein midi. Son cœur sautait à la danse des marteaux. Quand elle entrait, elle était toute rouge, les petits cheveux blonds de sa nuque envolés comme ceux d'une femme qui arrive à un rendez-vous. Goujet l'attendait, les bras nus, la poitrine nue, tapant plus fort sur l'enclume, ces jours-là, pour se faire entendre de plus loin. Il la devinait, l'accueillait d'un bon rire silencieux, dans sa barbe jaune. Mais elle ne voulait pas qu'il se dérangeât de son travail, elle le suppliait de reprendre le marteau, parce qu'elle l'aimait davantage, lorsqu'il le brandissait de ses gros bras, bossués de muscles. Elle allait donner une légère claque sur la joue d'Etienne pendu au soufflet, et elle restait là une heure, à regarder les boulons. Ils n'échangeaient pas dix paroles. Ils n'auraient pas mieux satisfait leur tendresse dans une chambre, enfermés à double tour. Les ricanements de Bec-Salé, dit Boit-sans-Soif, ne les gênaient guère, car ils ne les entendaient même plus. Au bout d'un quart d'heure, elle commençait à étouffer un peu ; la chaleur, l'odeur forte, les fumées qui montaient, l'étourdissaient, tandis que les coups sourds la secouaient des talons à la gorge. Elle ne désirait plus rien alors, c'était son plaisir. Goujet l'aurait serrée dans ses bras que ça ne lui aurait pas donné une émotion si grosse. Elle se rapprochait de lui, pour sentir le vent de son marteau sur sa joue, pour être dans le coup qu'il tapait. Quand des étincelles piquaient ses mains tendres, elle ne les retirait pas, elle jouissait au contraire de cette pluie de feu qui lui cinglait la peau. Lui, bien sûr, devinait le bonheur qu'elle goûtait là ; il réservait pour le vendredi les ouvrages difficiles, afin de lui faire la cour avec toute sa force et toute son adresse ; il ne se ménageait plus, au risque de fendre les enclumes en deux, haletant, les reins vibrant de la joie qu'il lui donnait. Pendant un printemps, leurs amours emplirent ainsi la forge d'un grondement d'orage. Ce fut une idylle dans une besogne de géant, au milieu du flamboiement de la houille, de l'ébranlement du hangar, dont la carcasse noire de suie craquait. Tout ce fer écrasé, pétri comme de la cire rouge, gardait les marques rudes de leurs tendresses. Le vendredi, quand la blanchisseuse quittait la Gueule-d'Or, elle remontait lentement la rue des Poissonniers, contentée, lassée, l'esprit et la chair tranquilles. Peu à peu, sa peur de Lantier diminua, elle redevint raisonnable. A cette époque, elle aurait encore vécu très heureuse, sans Coupeau, qui tournait mal, décidément. Un jour, elle revenait justement de la forge, lorsqu'elle crut reconnaître Coupeau dans l'Assommoir du père Colombe, en train de se payer des tournées de vitriol, avec Mes-Bottes, Bibi-la-Grillade et Bec-Salé, dit Boit-sans-Soif. Elle passa vite, pour ne pas avoir l'air de les moucharder. Mais elle se retourna : c'était bien Coupeau qui se jetait son petit verre de schnick dans le gosier, d'un geste familier déjà. Il mentait donc, il en était donc à l'eau-de-vie, maintenant ! Elle rentra désespérée ; toute son épouvante de l'eau-de-vie la reprenait. Le vin, elle le pardonnait, parce que le vin nourrit l'ouvrier ; les alcools, au contraire, étaient des saletés, des poisons qui ôtaient à l'ouvrier le goût du pain. Ah ! le gouvernement aurait bien dû empêcher la fabrication de ces cochonneries ! En arrivant rue de la Goutte-d'Or, elle trouva toute la maison bouleversée. Ses ouvrières avaient quitté l'établi, et étaient dans la cour, à regarder en l'air. Elle interrogea Clémence.","What a happy season! The laundress took particular care over her work in the rue des Portes-Blanches; she always brought him back her linen herself, because this errand every Friday was a ready-made pretext to go to rue Marcadet and go to the forge. As soon as she turned the corner of the street, she felt light, gay, as if she were out on a country trip, in the middle of these wastelands, lined with gray factories; the coal-black pavement, the plumes of steam on the roofs, amused him as much as a path of moss in a suburban wood, plunging between great clumps of greenery; and she loved the pale horizon, streaked by the tall factory chimneys, the hill of Montmartre which blocked the sky, with its chalky houses, pierced with regular holes in their windows. Then she slowed down when she arrived, jumping the puddles, enjoying crossing the deserted and tangled corners of the demolition site. In the background, the forge gleamed, even at high noon. His heart leaped at the dance of the hammers. When she came in, she was flushed, the little blond hair on the back of her neck flying like that of a woman arriving on a date. Goujet was waiting for him, bare arms, bare chest, hitting the anvil harder on those days to make himself heard from afar. He guessed it, welcomed it with a good, silent laugh in his yellow beard. But she didn't want him to bother with his work, she begged him to take up the hammer again, because she liked it more when he brandished it with his big, muscled arms. She was about to slap Etienne on the cheek, hanging from the bellows, and she stayed there for an hour, looking at the bolts. They did not exchange ten words. They couldn't have better satisfied their tenderness in a room, locked up double-locked. The sneers of Bec-Sale, known as Boit-sans-Soif, hardly bothered them, for they no longer even heard them. After a quarter of an hour, she began to choke a little; the heat, the strong smell, the rising smoke dazed her, while the dull blows shook her from her heels to her throat. She no longer wanted anything then, it was her pleasure. Goujet would have held her in his arms that it would not have given him such great emotion. She moved closer to him, to feel the wind of his hammer on her cheek, to be in on the blow he was hitting. When sparks stung her tender hands, she did not withdraw them, on the contrary she enjoyed this rain of fire which lashed her skin. He, of course, guessed the happiness she tasted there; he reserved the difficult works for Fridays, in order to pay court to her with all his strength and all his skill; he no longer spared himself, at the risk of splitting the anvils in two, panting, his loins quivering with the joy he gave her. During one spring, their love thus filled the forge with a stormy roar. It was an idyll in a gigantic task, amid the blazing coal, the shaking of the shed, whose soot-black carcass creaked. All this crushed iron, kneaded like red wax, kept the rough marks of their tenderness. On Fridays, when the laundress left the Gueule-d'Or, she walked slowly up the rue des Poissonniers, satisfied, weary, with peace of mind and body. Little by little, her fear of Lantier diminished, she became reasonable again. At that time, she would still have lived very happily, without Coupeau, who was definitely going badly. One day, she had just returned from the forge, when she thought she recognized Coupeau in Father Colombe's l'Assommoir, indulging in rounds of vitriol, with Mes-Bottes, Bibi-la-Grillade and Bec-Salé, says Drink-without-Thirst. She passed quickly, so as not to seem to snitch on them. But she turned around: it was Coupeau who was throwing his small glass of schnick down his throat, with an already familiar gesture. So he was lying, so he was on brandy now! She returned in despair; all her dread of brandy seized her again. Wine, she forgave him, because wine nourishes the workman; spirits, on the contrary, were dirt, poisons which deprived the workman of the taste of bread. Ah! the government should have prevented the production of this crap! When she reached rue de la Goutte-d'Or, she found the whole house upset. His workers had left the workbench, and were in the yard, looking up. She questioned Clemence.","What a happy season this was after all! The clearstarcher always carried a certain basket of clothes to her customer each week, because it gave her a pretext for going into the forge, as it was on her way. As soon as she turned the corner of the street in which it was situated she felt as lighthearted as if she were going to the country. The black charcoal dust in the road, the black smoke rising slowly from the chimneys, interested and pleased her as much as a mossy path through the woods. Afar off the forge was red even at midday, and her heart danced in time with the hammers. Goujet was expecting her and making more noise than usual, that she might hear him at a great distance. She gave Etienne a light tap on his cheek and sat quietly watching these two—this man and boy, who were so dear to her—for an hour without speaking. When the sparks touched her tender skin she rather enjoyed the sensation. He, in his turn, was fully aware of the happiness she felt in being there, and he reserved the work which required skill for the time when she could look on in wonder and admiration. It was an idyl that they were unconsciously enacting all that spring, and when Gervaise returned to her home it was in a spirit of sweet content. By degrees her unreasonable fears of Lantier were conquered. Coupeau was behaving very badly at this time, and one evening as she passed the Assommoir she was certain she saw him drinking with Mes-Bottes. She hurried on lest she should seem to be watching him. But as she hastened she looked over her shoulder. Yes, it was Coupeau who was tossing down a glass of liquor with an air as if it were no new thing. He had lied to her then; he did drink brandy. She was in utter despair, and all her old horror of brandy returned. Wine she could have forgiven—wine was good for a working man—liquor, on the contrary, was his ruin and took from him all desire for the food that nourished and gave him strength for his daily toil. Why did not the government interfere and prevent the manufacture of such pernicious things? When she reached her home she found the whole house in confusion. Her employees had left their work and were in the courtyard. She asked what the matter was.","What a happy time! The laundress took particular pains with the washing of her customer in the Rue des Portes-Blanches; she always took it home herself because that errand, every Friday, was a ready excuse for passing through the Rue Marcadet and looking in at the forge. The moment she turned the corner of the street she felt light and gay, as though in the midst of those plots of waste land surrounded by grey factories, she were out in the country; the roadway black with coal-dust, the plumage of steam over the roofs, amused her as much as a moss-covered path leading through masses of green foliage in a wood in the environs; and she loved the dull horizon, streaked by the tall factory-chimneys, the Montmartre heights, which hid the heavens from view, the chalky white houses pierced with the uniform openings of their windows. She would slacken her steps as she drew near, jumping over the pools of water, and finding a pleasure in traversing the deserted ins and outs of the yard full of old building materials. Right at the further end the forge shone with a brilliant light, even at mid-day. Her heart leapt with the dance of the hammers. When she entered, her face turned quite red, the little fair hairs at the nape of her neck flew about like those of a woman arriving at some lovers’ meeting. Goujet was expecting her, his arms and chest bare, whilst he hammered harder on the anvil on those days so as to make himself heard at a distance. He divined her presence, and greeted her with a good silent laugh in his yellow beard. But she would not let him leave off his work; she begged him to take up his hammer again, because she loved him the more when he wielded it with his big arms swollen with muscles. She would go and give Etienne a gentle tap on the cheek, as he hung on to the bellows, and then remain for an hour watching the rivets. The two did not exchange a dozen words. They could not have more completely satisfied their love if alone in a room with the door double-locked. The snickering of Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst, did not bother them in the least, for they no longer even heard him. At the end of a quarter of an hour she would begin to feel slightly oppressed; the heat, the powerful smell, the ascending smoke, made her dizzy, whilst the dull thuds of the hammers shook her from the crown of her head to the soles of her feet. Then she desired nothing more; it was her pleasure. Had Goujet pressed her in his arms it would not have procured her so sweet an emotion. She drew close to him that she might feel the wind raised by his hammer beat upon her cheek, and become, as it were, a part of the blow he struck. When the sparks made her soft hands smart, she did not withdraw them; on the contrary, she enjoyed the rain of fire which stung her skin. He for certain, divined the happiness which she tasted there; he always kept the most difficult work for the Fridays, so as to pay his court to her with all his strength and all his skill; he no longer spared himself at the risk of splitting the anvils in two, as he panted and his loins vibrated with the joy he was procuring her. All one spring-time their love thus filled Goujet with the rumbling of a storm. It was an idyll amongst giant-like labor in the midst of the glare of the coal fire, and of the shaking of the shed, the cracking carcass of which was black with soot. All that beaten iron, kneaded like red wax, preserved the rough marks of their love. When on the Fridays the laundress parted from Golden-Mug, she slowly reascended the Rue des Poissonniers, contented and tired, her mind and her body alike tranquil. Little by little, her fear of Lantier diminished; her good sense got the better of her. At that time she would still have led a happy life, had it not been for Coupeau, who was decidedly going to the bad. One day she just happened to be returning from the forge, when she fancied she recognized Coupeau inside Pere Colombe’s l’Assommoir, in the act of treating himself to a round of vitriol in the company of My-Boots, Bibi-the-Smoker, and Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst. She passed quickly by, so as not to seem to be spying on them. But she glanced back; it was indeed Coupeau who was tossing his little glass of bad brandy down his throat with a gesture already familiar. He lied then; so he went in for brandy now! She returned home in despair; all her old dread of brandy took possession of her. She forgave the wine, because wine nourishes the workman; all kinds of spirit, on the contrary, were filth, poisons which destroyed in the workman the taste for bread. Ah! the government ought to prevent the manufacture of such horrid stuff! On arriving at the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or, she found the whole house upset. Her workwomen had left the shop, and were in the courtyard looking up above. She questioned Clemence."

Mais, cette fois, il avait un gnon sur l'œil, une claque amicale égarée dans une bousculade. Ses cheveux frisés, où des fils blancs se montraient déjà, devaient avoir épousseté une encoignure de quelque salle louche de marchand de vin, car une toile d'araignée pendait à une mèche, sur la nuque. Il restait rigolo d'ailleurs, les traits un peu tirés et vieillis, la mâchoire inférieure saillant davantage, mais toujours bon enfant, disait-il, et la peau encore assez tendre pour faire envie à une duchesse.","The zinc worker held on to the workbench so as not to fall. It was the first time he had taken such a binge. Until then, he had returned tipsy, nothing more. But this time he had a snub over his eye, a friendly slap lost in a jostling.

Besides, he was still funny, his features a little drawn and aged, his lower jaw protruding more, but still good-natured, he said, and his skin still tender enough to be the envy of a duchess.",""" At the same time, however, Gervaise amiably laid down her work and went for the dirty clothes, which she piled up in the back shop.","The zinc-worker caught hold of the ironing-table to save himself from falling.

"Les Boche, pourtant, juges sévères des querelles de la maison, donnaient tort aux Lorilleux. Sans doute, les Lorilleux étaient des personnes comme il faut, tranquilles, travaillant toute la sainte journée, payant régulièrement leur terme. Mais là, franchement, la jalousie les enrageait. Avec ça, ils auraient tondu un œuf. Des pingres, quoi ! des gens qui cachaient leur litre, quand on montait, pour ne pas offrir un verre de vin ; enfin, du monde pas propre. Un jour, Gervaise venait de payer aux Boche du cassis avec de l'eau de Seltz, qu'on buvait dans la loge, quand madame Lorilleux était passée, très raide, en affectant de cracher devant la porte des concierges. Et, depuis lors, chaque samedi, madame Boche, lorsqu'elle balayait les escaliers et les couloirs, laissait des ordures devant la porte des Lorilleux.","The Boches, however, severe judges of the quarrels of the house, found the Lorilleux wrong.

One day, Gervaise had just paid the Boches some cassis with seltzer water, which they were drinking in the box, when Madame Lorilleux had passed by, very stiff, affecting to spit in front of the concierges' door. And since then, every Saturday, Madame Boche, when she was sweeping the stairs and the corridors, left rubbish in front of the door of the Lorilleux.",Boche and his wife sat in judgment on the quarrel and gave as their opinion that the Lorilleuxs were much to blame.,"The Boches, however, who sternly disapproved of quarrels in their building, said that the Lorilleuxs were in the wrong. The Lorilleuxs were no doubt respectable persons, quiet, working the whole day long, and paying their rent regularly. But, really, jealousy had driven them mad. And they were mean enough to skin an egg, real misers. They were so stingy that they’d hide their bottle when any one came in, so as not to have to offer a glass of wine—not regular people at all. Gervaise had brought over cassis and soda water one day to drink with the Boches. When Madame Lorilleux went by, she acted out spitting before the concierge’s door. Well, after that when Madame Boche swept the corridors on Saturdays, she always left a pile of trash before the Lorilleuxs’ door."

"Il y eut des rires. Le vieux resta court, fit de ses yeux pâles le tour de la table, et reprit son air de brute songeuse. Le café était bu, le zingueur avait redemandé du vin. Clémence venait de se remettre à manger des fraises. Pendant un instant, les chansons cessèrent, on parlait d'une femme qu'on avait trouvée pendue le matin, dans la maison d'à côté. C'était le tour de madame Lerat, mais il lui fallait des préparatifs. Elle trempa le coin de sa serviette dans un verre d'eau et se l'appliqua sur les tempes, parce qu'elle avait trop chaud. Ensuite, elle demanda une larme d'eau-de-vie, la but, s'essuya longuement les lèvres.","There were laughs. The old man remained short, looked around the table with his pale eyes, and resumed his air of pensive brute. The coffee was drunk, the zinc worker had asked for more wine. Clémence had just started eating strawberries again. For a moment the songs stopped, there was talk of a woman who had been found hanged that morning in the house next door. It was Madame Lerat's turn, but she had to make preparations. She dipped the corner of her napkin in a glass of water and applied it to her temples, because she was too hot. Then she asked for a drop of brandy, drank it, wiped her lips for a long time.","Coupeau called for more wine, and Clémence helped herself to more strawberries. The singing ceased, and the conversation turned upon a woman who had hanged herself the day before in the next street. It was now Mme Lerat's turn to amuse the company, but she needed to make certain preparations. She dipped the corner of her napkin into a glass of water and applied it to her temples because she was too warm. Then she asked for a teaspoonful of brandy and wiped her lips.","This raised a few laughs. The old fellow stopped short, glanced round the table with his pale eyes and resumed his look of a meditative animal. Coupeau called for more wine as the coffee was finished. Clemence was eating strawberries again. With the pause in singing, they began to talk about a woman who had been found hanging that morning in the building next door. It was Madame Lerat’s turn, but she required to prepare herself. She dipped the corner of her napkin into a glass of water and applied it to her temples because she was too hot. Then, she asked for a thimbleful of brandy, drank it, and slowly wiped her lips."
"Justement, ce fut le père Bazouge qui vint, avec la caisse des pauvres sous le bras, pour l'emballer. Il était encore joliment soûl, ce jour-là, mais bon zig tout de même, et gai comme un pinson. Quand il eut reconnu la pratique à laquelle il avait affaire, il lâcha des réflexions philosophiques, en préparant son petit ménage.","As it happened, it was Father Bazouge who came, with the case for the poor under his arm, to pack it up. He was still pretty drunk that day, but a good zig all the same, and gay as a chaffinch. When he had recognized the practice with which he had to deal, he let go of philosophical reflections, while preparing his little household.","But the truth was she died of utter weariness of life, and Father Bazonge came the day she was found dead in her den. Under his arm he carried a coffin, and he was very tipsy and as gay as a lark.","It happened to be old Bazouge who came with the pauper’s coffin under his arm to pack her up. He was again precious drunk that day, but a jolly fellow all the same, and as lively as a cricket. When he recognized the customer he had to deal with he uttered several philosophical reflections, whilst performing his little business."
- Vous avez un drôle de goût d'aimer une boiteuse.,- You have a funny taste to love a lame woman.,"She knew very well that it was very evident, and at forty it would be far worse, but she said softly, with a faint smile, ""You have a strange taste, to fall in love with a lame woman!""","Then she added gently, with a slight laugh: “It’s a funny fancy of yours to fall in love with a cripple.”"
"- Nous y sommes, reprit le zingueur. Attention ! tenez-vous au mur ; il y a trois marches.","- We are there, resumed the zinc worker. Attention ! hold on to the wall; there are three steps.","""Here we are,"" said the tinworker. ""Isn't it a journey? Look out for three steps. Hold onto the wall.""","“We’re here,” resumed the zinc-worker. “Be careful, keep to the wall; there are three steps.”"
Chapitre 12,Chapter 12,CHAPTER XII,CHAPTER XII
"Il fallait voir Coupeau crâner dans la rue de la Goutte-d'Or ! Il appelait Poisson le cocu. Ça leur clouait le bec, aux bavardes ! Ce n'était plus lui, le cocu. Oh ! il savait ce qu'il savait. S'il avait eu l'air de ne pas entendre, dans le temps, c'était apparemment qu'il n'aimait pas les potins. Chacun connaît son chez soi et se gratte où ça le démange. Ça ne le démangeait pas, lui ; il ne pouvait pas se gratter, pour faire plaisir au monde. Eh bien ! et le sergent de ville, est-ce qu'il entendait ? Pourtant ça y était, cette fois ; on avait vu les amoureux, il ne s'agissait plus d'un cancan en l'air. Et il se fâchait, il ne comprenait pas comment un homme, un fonctionnaire du gouvernement, souffrait chez lui un pareil scandale. Le sergent de ville devait aimer la resucée des autres, voilà tout. Les soirs où Coupeau s'ennuyait, seul avec sa femme dans leur trou, sous les toits, ça ne l'empêchait pas de descendre chercher Lantier et de l'amener de force. Il trouvait la cambuse triste, depuis que le camarade n'était plus là. Il le raccommodait avec Gervaise, s'il les voyait en froid. Tonnerre de Dieu ! est-ce qu'on n'envoie pas le monde à la balançoire, est-ce qu'il est défendu de s'amuser comme on l'entend ? Il ricanait, des idées larges s'allumaient dans ses yeux vacillants de pochard, des besoins de tout partager avec le chapelier, pour embellir la vie. Et c'était surtout ces soirs-là que Gervaise ne savait plus s'il parlait pour rire ou pour de bon.","You should have seen Coupeau showing off in the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or! He called Poisson the cuckold. It nailed their beaks, gossips! He was no longer the cuckold. Oh ! he knew what he knew. If he had seemed not to hear, at the time, it was apparently that he didn't like gossip. Everyone knows their home and scratches where it itches. It didn't itch him; he couldn't scratch himself, to please the world. Well ! and the sergent de ville, did he hear? Yet there it was, this time; we had seen the lovers, it was no longer a matter of idle gossip. And he got angry, he didn't understand how a man, a government official, suffered such a scandal at home. The sergent de ville must have liked the rehash of others, that's all. The evenings when Coupeau was bored, alone with his wife in their hole, under the roof, that did not prevent him from going down to look for Lantier and dragging him away. He found the galley sad, since the comrade was no longer there. He would mend it with Gervaise if he saw them cold. Thunder of God! aren't we sending the world to the seesaw, is it forbidden to have fun as we see fit? He sneered, broad ideas lit up in his flickering drunken eyes, the need to share everything with the hatter, to make life more beautiful. And it was especially on those evenings that Gervaise no longer knew if he was talking for fun or for good.","She had had bad luck, he said, with hatters and blacksmiths—why did she not try a mason? He said this as if it were a joke, but Gervaise had a firm conviction that he was in deadly earnest. A man who is tipsy from one year's end to the next is not apt to be fastidious, and there are husbands who at twenty are very jealous and at thirty have grown very complacent under the influence of constant tippling.","He said such things as if he were joking, but they upset Gervaise because his small grey eyes seemed to be boring right into her. On evenings when Coupeau became bored being alone with his wife up in their tiny hole under the roof, he would go down for Lantier and invite him up. He thought their dump was too dreary without Lantier’s company so he patched things up between Gervaise and Lantier whenever they had a falling out."
"- Je le veux ! bégaya Etienne, la bouche empâtée de sommeil.","- I want it ! stammered Etienne, his mouth thick with sleep.","""I wish it!"" stammered Etienne, half asleep.","“I wish it!” stuttered Etienne, his voice thick with sleep."
"Alors, comme madame Boche le laissait aller, il tira son frère devant le robinet. Ils s'amusèrent tous les deux à faire couler l'eau.","Then, as Madame Boche let him go, he pulled his brother to the tap. They both had fun running the water.","Then as Mme Boche made no attempt to detain him, he drew his brother to the faucet, where the two amused themselves in making the water run.","Then, when Madame Boche let him go, he drew his brother in front of the tap, and they amused themselves by turning on the water."
"Virginie alors intervint, en les priant de lui flanquer la paix. Elle avait l'Europe quelque part. Comment deux hommes qui partageaient tout le reste, pouvaient-ils s'attraper sans cesse à propos de la politique ? Ils mâchèrent un instant de sourdes paroles. Puis, le sergent de ville, pour montrer qu'il n'avait pas de rancune, apporta le couvercle de sa petite boîte, qu'il venait de terminer ; on lisait dessus, en lettres marquetées : A Auguste, souvenir d'amitié. Lantier, très flatté, se renversa, s'étala, si bien qu'il était presque sur Virginie. Et le mari regardait ça, avec son visage couleur de vieux mur, dans lequel ses yeux troubles ne disaient rien ; mais les poils rouges de ses moustaches remuaient tout seuls par moments, d'une drôle de façon, ce qui aurait pu inquiéter un homme moins sûr de son affaire que le chapelier.","Virginie then intervened, begging them to leave her alone. She had Europe somewhere. How could two men who shared everything else ever catch on to each other over politics? They chewed silent words for a moment. Then, the sergent de ville, to show that he had no grudge, brought the lid of his little box, which he had just finished; one read above, in inlaid letters: To Auguste, memory of friendship. Lantier, very flattered, fell back, sprawled so that he was almost on top of Virginie. And the husband looked at it, with his face the color of an old wall, in which his troubled eyes said nothing; but the red hairs of his mustache moved by themselves at times, in a funny way, which might have worried a man less sure of his business than the hatter.",When Virginie tossed it toward her she did not take it up instantly.,"Thereupon Virginie intervened, bidding them stop their row. She didn’t care a fig for Europe. How could two men, who shared everything else, always be disputing about politics? For a minute they mumbled some indistinct words. Then the policeman, in view of showing that he harbored no spite, produced the cover of his little box, which he had just finished; it bore the inscription in marquetry: “To Auguste, a token of friendship.” Lantier, feeling exceedingly flattered, lounged back and spread himself out so that he almost sat upon Virginie. And the husband viewed the scene with his face the color of an old wall and his bleared eyes fairly expressionless; but all the same, at moments the red hairs of his moustaches stood up on end of their own accord in a very singular fashion, which would have alarmed any man who was less sure of his business than the hatter."
"Le ménage vécut dans l'enchantement de sa nouvelle demeure. Le lit d'Etienne occupait le cabinet, où l'on pouvait encore installer une autre couchette d'enfant. La cuisine était grande comme la main et toute noire ; mais, en laissant la porte ouverte, on y voyait assez clair ; puis, Gervaise n'avait pas à faire des repas de trente personnes, il suffisait qu'elle y trouvât la place de son pot-au-feu. Quant à la grande chambre, elle était leur orgueil. Dès le matin, ils fermaient les rideaux de l'alcôve, des rideaux de calicot blanc ; et la chambre se trouvait transformée en salle à manger, avec la table au milieu, l'armoire et la commode en face l'une de l'autre. Comme la cheminée brûlait jusqu'à quinze sous de charbon de terre par jour, ils l'avaient bouchée ; un petit poêle de fonte, posé sur la plaque de marbre, les chauffait pour sept sous pendant les grands froids. Ensuite, Coupeau avait orné les murs de son mieux, en se promettant des embellissements : une haute gravure représentant un maréchal de France, caracolant avec son bâton à la main, entre un canon et un tas de boulets, tenait lieu de glace ; au-dessus de la commode, les photographies de la famille étaient rangées sur deux lignes, à droite et à gauche d'un ancien bénitier de porcelaine dorée, dans lequel on mettait les allumettes ; sur la corniche de l'armoire, un buste de Pascal faisait pendant à un buste de Béranger, l'un grave, l'autre souriant, près du coucou, dont ils semblaient écouter le tic-tac. C'était vraiment une belle chambre.","The household lived in the enchantment of their new home. Etienne's bed occupied the closet, where another child's bunk could be installed. The kitchen was as big as a hand and completely dark; but, leaving the door open, one could see through it quite clearly; besides, Gervaise didn't have to cook meals for thirty people, it was enough for her to find room for her pot-au-feu. As for the great chamber, it was their pride. In the morning they closed the curtains of the alcove, curtains of white calico; and the bedroom was transformed into a dining-room, with the table in the middle, the cupboard and the chest of drawers facing each other. As the chimney was burning up to fifteen sous of coal a day, they had stopped it up; a small cast-iron stove, placed on the marble slab, heated them for seven sous during very cold weather. Afterwards, Coupeau had decorated the walls as best he could, promising himself embellishments: a tall engraving representing a Marshal of France, prancing with his stick in his hand, between a cannon and a heap of balls, took the place of ice; above the chest of drawers, the photographs of the family were ranged in two rows, to the right and to the left of an old font of gilded porcelain, in which the matches were placed; on the cornice of the cupboard, a bust of Pascal matched a bust of Béranger, one serious, the other smiling, near the cuckoo clock, whose ticking they seemed to be listening to. It was really a nice room.","Etienne's bed was placed in the tiny room, almost a closet, and there was room for the cradle by its side. The kitchen was about as big as one's hand and very dark, but by leaving the door open one could see pretty well, and as Gervaise had no big dinners to get she managed comfortably. The large room was her pride. In the morning the white curtains of the alcove were drawn, and the bedroom was transformed into a lovely dining room, with its table in the middle, the commode and a wardrobe opposite each other. A tiny stove kept them warm in cold weather for seven sous per day. Coupeau ornamented the walls with several engravings—one of a marshal of France on a spirited steed, with his baton in his hand. Above the commode were the photographs of the family, arranged in two lines, with an antique china bénitier between. On the corners of the commode a bust of Pascal faced another of Béranger—one grave, the other smiling. It was, indeed, a fair and pleasant home.","The couple were thoroughly enchanted with their new home. Etienne’s bed occupied the small closet, where there was still room to put another child’s crib. The kitchen was a very tiny affair and as dark as night, but by leaving the door wide open, one could just manage to see; besides, Gervaise had not to cook meals for thirty people, all she wanted was room to make her soup. As for the large room, it was their pride. The first thing in the morning, they drew the curtains of the alcove, white calico curtains; and the room was thus transformed into a dining-room, with the table in the centre, and the wardrobe and chest of drawers facing each other. They stopped up the chimney since it burned as much as fifteen sous of coal a day. A small cast-iron stove on the marble hearth gave them enough warmth on cold days for only seven sous. Coupeau had also done his best to decorate the walls. There was a large engraving showing a marshal of France on horseback with a baton in his hand. Family photographs were arranged in two rows on top of the chest of drawers on each side of an old holy-water basin in which they kept matches. Busts of Pascal and Beranger were on top of the wardrobe. It was really a handsome room."
"C'est lui qui trouvait ça patagueule, de jouer le drame devant le monde ! Eh bien ! quoi ! il n'avait pas travaillé, les boulangers pétrissaient tout de même. Elle le prenait peut-être pour un dépuceleur de nourrices, à venir l'intimider avec ses histoires.","He was the one who found it clumsy, to play the drama in front of the world! Well ! what ! he hadn't worked, the bakers kneaded all the same. Perhaps she took him for a childminder, coming to intimidate him with his stories.","Well then, eat your fist and keep the other for tomorrow."" ""Shall I steal a loaf of bread?"" she asked in a dull, dreary tone.","He considered it highly improper to do the dramatic in other people’s presence. What, he hadn’t worked, and yet the bakers kneaded bread all the same. Did she take him for a fool, to come and try to frighten him with her stories? “Do you want me to turn thief?”"
"Cependant, un soir de janvier, elle cogna des deux poings contre la cloison. Elle avait passé une semaine affreuse, bousculée par tout le monde, sans le sou, à bout de courage. Ce soir-là, elle n'était pas bien, elle grelottait la fièvre et voyait danser des flammes. Alors, au lieu de se jeter par la fenêtre, comme elle en avait eu l'envie un moment, elle se mit à taper et à appeler :","However, one evening in January, she banged both fists against the partition. She had spent a terrible week, pushed around by everyone, penniless, at the end of her tether. That evening she was not well, she was shivering with fever and saw flames dancing. So, instead of throwing herself out of the window, as she had felt like doing for a moment, she began to type and call:","One night she was sick and feverish, and instead of throwing herself out of the window as she was tempted to do, she rapped on the partition and called loudly:","However, one evening in January she knocked with both her fists against the partition. She had passed a frightful week, hustled by everyone, without a sou, and utterly discouraged. That evening she was not at all well, she shivered with fever, and seemed to see flames dancing about her. Then, instead of throwing herself out of the window, as she had at one moment thought of doing, she set to knocking and calling:"
"Et tous deux tapèrent un instant sur elle. Ça n'empêchait pas les mâchoires de fonctionner, le brie disparaissait, les litres coulaient comme des fontaines. Cependant, Gervaise mollissait sous les coups. Elle ne répondait rien, la bouche toujours pleine, se dépêchant, comme si elle avait eu très faim. Quand ils se lassèrent, elle leva doucement la tête, elle dit :","And they both hit her for a moment. That didn't stop the jaws from working, the brie disappeared, the liters flowed like fountains. However, Gervaise softened under the blows. She didn't answer, her mouth still full, hurrying, as if she were very hungry. When they got tired, she gently raised her head, she said:",When the others came in she looked up suddenly and said to Virginie gently:,"For a time they both went on at her. Meanwhile, the Brie was quickly disappearing and the wine bottles were pouring like fountains. Gervaise began to weaken under this persistent pounding. She answered nothing, but hurried herself, her mouth ever full, as though she had been very hungry. When they got tired, she gently raised her head and said:"
"Ce louchon d'Augustine éclata, tant le mot lui parut drôle. On la gronda. En voilà une morveuse qui riait des mots qu'elle ne devait pas comprendre ! Clémence lui passa son fer ; l'apprentie finissait les fers sur ses torchons et sur ses bas, quand ils n'étaient plus assez chauds pour les pièces amidonnées. Mais elle empoigna celui-là si maladroitement, qu'elle se fit une manchette, une longue brûlure au poignet. Et elle sanglota, elle accusa Clémence de l'avoir brûlée exprès. L'ouvrière, qui était allée chercher un fer très chaud pour le devant de la chemise, la consola tout de suite en la menaçant de lui repasser les deux oreilles, si elle continuait. Cependant, elle avait fourré une laine sous le plastron, elle poussait lentement le fer, laissant à l'amidon le temps de ressortir et de sécher. Le devant de chemise prenait une raideur et un luisant de papier fort.","That cross-eyed Augustine burst out, the word seemed so funny to her. They scolded her. Here is a brat who laughed at the words she should not understand! Clemence handed him her iron; the apprentice finished the irons on her tea towels and her stockings, when they were no longer hot enough for the starched pieces. But she grabbed this one so awkwardly that she made herself a cuff, a long burn on her wrist. And she sobbed, she accused Clemence of having burned her on purpose. The worker, who had gone to fetch a very hot iron for the front of the shirt, consoled her immediately by threatening to iron both her ears if she continued. However, she had stuffed a piece of wool under the breastplate, she pushed the iron slowly, giving the starch time to come out and dry. The front of the shirt took on a stiffness and a sheen of strong paper.",He struggled a little and with a silly laugh asked if Clémence was not coming too. Gervaise undressed her husband and tucked him up in bed as if he had been a child and then returned to her fluting irons in time to still a grand dispute that was going on about an iron that had not been properly cleaned.,"That squint-eyed Augustine almost burst, the joke seemed to her so funny. The others bullied her. There was a brat for you who laughed at words she ought not to understand! Clemence handed her her iron; the apprentice finished up the irons on the stockings and the dish-cloths when they were not hot enough for the starched things. But she took hold of this one so clumsily that she made herself a cuff in the form of a long burn on the wrist. And she sobbed and accused Clemence of having burnt her on purpose. The latter who had gone to fetch a very hot iron for the shirt-front consoled her at once by threatening to iron her two ears if she did not leave off. Then she placed a piece of flannel under the front and slowly passed the iron over it giving the starch time to show up and dry. The shirt-front became as stiff and as shiny as cardboard."
"Peut-être, le soir, Coupeau rapporterait-il de l'argent. Il disait qu'il travaillait. Tout est possible, n'est-ce pas ? et Gervaise, attrapée pourtant bien des fois, avait fini par compter sur cet argent-là. Elle, après toutes sortes d'histoires, ne trouvait plus seulement un torchon à laver dans le quartier ; même une vieille dame dont elle faisait le ménage, venait de la flanquer dehors, en l'accusant de boire ses liqueurs. On ne voulait d'elle nulle part, elle était brûlée ; ce qui l'arrangeait dans le fond, car elle en était tombée à ce point d'abrutissement, où l'on préfère crever que de remuer ses dix doigts. Enfin, si Coupeau rapportait sa paie, on mangerait quelque chose de chaud. Et, en attendant, comme midi n'avait pas sonné, elle restait allongée sur la paillasse, parce qu'on a moins froid et moins faim, lorsqu'on est allongé.","Perhaps, in the evening, Coupeau would bring in some money. He said he was working. Everything is possible, isn't it? and Gervaise, though she had been caught many times, had ended up counting on that money. She, after all sorts of fuss, couldn't even find a cloth to wash in the neighborhood; even an old lady whom she was cleaning had just kicked her out, accusing her of drinking her liqueurs. They didn't want her anywhere, she was burnt out; which basically helped her, for she had fallen to that point of stupefaction, where one would rather die than move one's ten fingers. Anyway, if Coupeau brought back his pay, we'd eat something hot. And, in the meantime, as noon had not struck, she remained stretched out on the straw mattress, because one is less cold and less hungry when one is lying down.","Gervaise thought it barely possible that her husband might come in with a little money. After all, everything is possible, and he had said that he would work. Gervaise after a little, by dint of dwelling on this thought, had come to consider it a certainty. Yes, Coupeau would bring home some money, and they would have a good, hot, comfortable dinner. As to herself, she had given up trying to get work, for no one would have her. This did not much trouble her, however, for she had arrived at that point when the mere exertion of moving had become intolerable to her. She now lay stretched on the bed, for she was warmer there.","Perhaps Coupeau would bring back some money in the evening. He said that he was working. Anything is possible, isn’t it? And Gervaise, although she had been caught many and many a time, had ended by relying on this coin. After all sorts of incidents, she herself couldn’t find as much as a duster to wash in the whole neighborhood; and even an old lady, whose rooms she did, had just given her the sack, charging her with swilling her liqueurs. No one would engage her, she was washed up everywhere; and this secretly suited her, for she had fallen to that state of indifference when one prefers to croak rather than move one’s fingers. At all events, if Coupeau brought his pay home they would have something warm to eat. And meanwhile, as it wasn’t yet noon, she remained stretched on the mattress, for one doesn’t feel so cold or so hungry when one is lying down."
"Le nez des Lorilleux les égayait à l'avance. Mais il s'agissait de ne pas rester planté là, à regarder la table. Les Coupeau avaient déjeuné très tard, vers une heure, avec un peu de charcuterie, parce que les trois fourneaux étaient déjà occupés, et qu'ils ne voulaient pas salir la vaisselle lavée pour le soir. A quatre heures, les deux femmes furent dans leur coup de feu. L'oie rôtissait devant une coquille placée par terre, contre le mur, à côté de la fenêtre ouverte ; et la bête était si grosse, qu'il avait fallu l'enfoncer de force dans la rôtissoire. Ce louchon d'Augustine, assise sur un petit banc, recevant en plein le reflet d'incendie de la coquille, arrosait l'oie gravement avec une cuiller à long manche. Gervaise s'occupait des pois au lard. Maman Coupeau, la tête perdue au milieu de tous ces plats, tournait, attendait le moment de mettre réchauffer l'épinée et la blanquette. Vers cinq heures, les invités commencèrent à arriver. Ce furent d'abord les deux ouvrières, Clémence et madame Putois, toutes deux endimanchées, la première en bleu, la seconde en noir ; Clémence tenait un géranium, madame Putois, un héliotrope ; et Gervaise, qui justement avait les mains blanches de farine, dut leur appliquer à chacune deux gros baisers, les mains rejetées en arrière. Puis, sur leurs talons, Virginie entra, mise comme une dame, en robe de mousseline imprimée, avec une écharpe et un chapeau, bien qu'elle eût eu seulement la rue à traverser. Celle-là apportait un pot d'œillets rouges. Elle prit elle-même la blanchisseuse dans ses grands bras et la serra fortement. Enfin, parurent Boche avec un pot de pensées, madame Boche avec un pot de réséda, madame Lerat avec une citronnelle, un pot dont la terre avait sali sa robe de mérinos violet. Tout ce monde s'embrassait, s'entassait dans la chambre, au milieu des trois fourneaux et de la coquille, d'où montait une chaleur d'asphyxie. Les bruits de friture des poêlons couvraient les voix. Une robe qui accrocha la rôtissoire, causa une émotion. Ça sentait l'oie si fort, que les nez s'agrandissaient. Et Gervaise était très aimable, remerciait chacun de son bouquet, sans cesser pour cela de préparer la liaison de la blanquette, au fond d'une assiette creuse. Elle avait posé les pots dans la boutique, au bout de la table, sans leur enlever leur haute collerette de papier blanc. Un parfum doux de fleurs se mêlait à l'odeur de la cuisine.","The Lorilleux's nose amused them in advance. But it was about not just standing there staring at the table. The Coupeaus had lunched very late, around one o'clock, with a bit of charcuterie, because the three stoves were already busy, and they didn't want to soil the dishes they had washed for the evening. At four o'clock the two women were in their shot. The goose was roasting in front of a shell placed on the floor, against the wall, beside the open window; and the animal was so big that it had to be forced into the roasting pan. That squinty Augustine, seated on a little bench, receiving the full reflection of the fire from the shell, was basting the goose gravely with a long-handled spoon. Gervaise took care of the peas and bacon. Maman Coupeau, her head lost in the middle of all these dishes, was turning around, waiting for the moment to heat up the spinach and the blanquette. Around five o'clock the guests began to arrive. First came the two workers, Clemence and Madame Putois, both in their Sunday best, the first in blue, the second in black; Clemence held a geranium, Madame Putois a heliotrope; and Gervaise, who happened to have her hands white with flour, had to give them two big kisses, her hands thrown back. Then, on their heels, Virginie entered, dressed like a lady, in a printed muslin dress, with a scarf and a hat, although she only had to cross the street. This one brought a pot of red carnations. She herself took the washerwoman in her big arms and hugged her tightly. Finally, Boche appeared with a pot of pansies, Madame Boche with a pot of mignonette, Madame Lerat with a citronella, a pot whose soil had soiled her purple merino dress. All these people embraced each other, crowded into the room, in the middle of the three stoves and the shell, from which a heat of asphyxiation rose. The sounds of frying pans drowned out the voices. A dress which caught the rotisserie, caused an emotion. It smelled of goose so strongly, that the noses were getting bigger. And Gervaise was very kind, thanked everyone for their bouquet, without ceasing to prepare the connection of the blanquette, at the bottom of a soup plate. She had placed the jars in the shop, at the end of the table, without removing their high white paper collar. A sweet scent of flowers mingled with the smell of cooking.","""No indeed,"" answered the old woman, ""but I wish to see them when they first come in—just to see how they look!"" At four o'clock the goose was roasted, and Augustine, seated on a little footstool, was given a long-handled spoon and bidden to watch and baste it every few minutes. Gervaise was busy with the peas, and Mamma Coupeau, with her head a little confused, was waiting until it was time to heat the veal and the pork. At five the guests began to arrive. Clémence and Mme Putois, gorgeous to behold in their Sunday rig, were the first. Clémence wore a blue dress and had some geraniums in her hand; Madame was in black, with a bunch of heliotrope. Gervaise, whose hands were covered with flour, put them behind her back, came forward and kissed them cordially. After them came Virginie in scarf and hat, though she had only to cross the street; she wore a printed muslin and was as imposing as any lady in the land. She brought a pot of red carnations and put both her arms around her friend and kissed her. The offering brought by Boche was a pot of pansies, and his wife's was mignonette; Mme Lerat's, a lemon verbena. The three furnaces filled the room with an overpowering heat, and the frying potatoes drowned their voices. Gervaise was very sweet and smiling, thanking everyone for the flowers, at the same time making the dressing for the salad. The perfume of the flowers was perceived above all the smell of cooking.","Thinking of the faces they would make gave them pleasure ahead of time. However, they couldn’t remain standing there admiring the table. The Coupeaus had lunched very late on just a bite or two, because the stoves were already in use, and because they did not want to dirty any dishes needed for the evening. By four o’clock the two women were working very hard. The huge goose was being cooked on a spit. Squint-eyed Augustine was sitting on a low bench solemnly basting the goose with a long-handled spoon. Gervaise was busy with the peas with bacon. Mother Coupeau, kept spinning around, a bit confused, waiting for the right time to begin reheating the pork and the veal. Towards five o’clock the guests began to arrive. First of all came the two workwomen, Clemence and Madame Putois, both in their Sunday best, the former in blue, the latter in black; Clemence carried a geranium, Madame Putois a heliotrope, and Gervaise, whose hands were just then smothered with flour, had to kiss each of them on both cheeks with her arms behind her back. Then following close upon their heels entered Virginie dressed like a lady in a printed muslin costume with a sash and a bonnet though she had only a few steps to come. She brought a pot of red carnations. She took the laundress in her big arms and squeezed her tight. At length Boche appeared with a pot of pansies and Madame Boche with a pot of mignonette; then came Madame Lerat with a balm-mint, the pot of which had dirtied her violet merino dress. All these people kissed each other and gathered together in the back-room in the midst of the three stoves and the roasting apparatus, which gave out a stifling heat. The noise from the saucepans drowned the voices. A dress catching in the Dutch oven caused quite an emotion. The smell of roast goose was so strong that it made their mouths water. And Gervaise was very pleasant, thanking everyone for their flowers without however letting that interfere with her preparing the thickening for the stewed veal at the bottom of a soup plate. She had placed the pots in the shop at one end of the table without removing the white paper that was round them. A sweet scent of flowers mingled with the odor of cooking."
"- On rencontre dix positions pour une, expliquait-il souvent. Seulement, ce n'est pas la peine d'entrer dans des boites où l'on ne restera pas vingt-quatre heures ? Ainsi, j'arrive un lundi chez Champion, à Montrouge. Le soir, Champion m'embête sur la politique ; il n'avait pas les mêmes idées que moi. Eh bien ! le mardi matin, je filais, attendu que nous ne sommes plus au temps des esclaves et que je ne veux pas me vendre pour sept francs par jour.","- We meet ten positions for one, he often explained. Only, isn't it worth going into clubs where you won't stay twenty-four hours? Thus, I arrive on a Monday at Champion, in Montrouge. In the evening, Champion bothers me about politics; he didn't have the same ideas as me. Well ! on Tuesday mornings I would spin, seeing that we are no longer in the time of slaves and that I don't want to sell myself for seven francs a day.","""I am very careful,"" he said, ""in making an engagement. I do not choose to bind myself to a man and find, when it is too late, that he intends to make a slave of me. I went one Monday to Champion at Monrouge. That evening Champion began a political discussion. He and I differed entirely, and on Tuesday I threw up the situation. You can't blame me , I am sure, for not being willing to sell my soul and my convictions for seven francs per day!""","He would not even say where he lived, only that he was staying with a friend and there was no use in coming to see him because he was never in."
"Autour de la table, les invités attendaient avec des mines longues. Le zingueur donna des poignées de main, en se dandinant devant les dames. Gervaise, un peu oppressée, parlait à demi-voix, faisait placer le monde. Mais, brusquement, elle s'aperçut que, madame Goujet n'étant pas venue, une place allait rester vide, la place à côté de madame Lorilleux.","Around the table, the guests were waiting with long faces. The zinc worker shook hands, waddling in front of the ladies. Gervaise, a little overwhelmed, spoke in a low voice, making everyone sit down. But suddenly she noticed that, Madame Goujet not having come, a place was going to remain empty, the place next to Madame Lorilleux.","They returned to the shop, however, in a very different mood from the one in which they had left it and found the guests, with very long faces, awaiting them. Coupeau shook hands with the ladies in succession, with difficulty keeping his feet as he did so, and Gervaise, in a choked voice, begged them to take their seats. But suddenly she perceived that Mme Goujet not having come, there was an empty seat next to Mme Lorilleux.","The guests were standing round the table with very long faces. The zinc-worker shook hands with them, showing himself off before the ladies. Gervaise, feeling rather depressed, spoke in a low voice as she directed them to their places. But she suddenly noticed that, as Madame Goujet had not come, a seat would remain empty—the one next to Madame Lorilleux."
"Mais Virginie, qui levait les yeux, s'interrompit et poussa un soupir étouffé.","But Virginie, who was looking up, broke off and gave a stifled sigh.","""I have just seen Lantier pass the door.","But Virginie raised her eyes, interrupted herself and heaved a smothered sigh."
"L'enfant perdu que sa mère abandonne,","The lost child that his mother abandons,","""L'Enfant perdu que sa mère abandonne,",“The lost child left by its mother alone
"- Monsieur Goujet, monsieur Goujet ?","- Mr. Goujet, Mr. Goujet?","The bellows had sent up leaping flames which lit every crevice and corner of the dusty old building, and Gervaise recognized Goujet before the forge with two other men.",“Monsieur Goujet! Monsieur Goujet!”
"Un instant, elle souffla devant la porte. Il se battait donc avec une armée ! Quand elle entra, ça croissait et ça embellissait. Coupeau était fou furieux, un échappé de Charenton ! Il se démenait au milieu de la cellule, envoyant les mains partout, sur lui, sur les murs, par terre, culbutant, tapant dans le vide ; et il voulait ouvrir la fenêtre, et il se cachait, se défendait, appelait, répondait, tout seul pour faire ce sabbat, de l'air exaspéré d'un homme cauchemardé par une flopée de monde. Puis, Gervaise comprit qu'il s'imaginait être sur un toit, en train de poser des plaques de zinc. Il faisait le soufflet avec sa bouche, il remuait des fers dans le réchaud, se mettait à genoux, pour passer le pouce sur les bords du paillasson, en croyant qu'il le soudait. Oui, son métier lui revenait, au moment de crever ; et s'il gueulait si fort, s'il se crochait sur son toit, c'était que des mufes l'empêchaient d'exécuter proprement son travail. Sur tous les toits voisins, il y avait de la fripouille qui le mécanisait. Avec ça, ces blagueurs lui lâchaient des bandes de rats dans les jambes. Ah ! les sales bêtes, il les voyait toujours ! Il avait beau les écraser, en frottant son pied sur le sol de toutes ses forces, il en passait de nouvelles ribambelles, le toit en était noir. Est-ce qu'il n'y avait pas des araignées aussi ! Il serrait rudement son pantalon pour tuer contre sa cuisse de grosses araignées, qui s'étaient fourrées là. Sacré tonnerre ! il ne finirait jamais sa journée, on voulait le perdre, son patron allait l'envoyer à Mazas. Alors, en se dépêchant, il crut qu'il avait une machine à vapeur dans le ventre ; la bouche grande ouverte, il soufflait de la fumée, une fumée épaisse qui emplissait la cellule et qui sortait par la fenêtre ; et penché, soufflant toujours, il regardait dehors le ruban de fumée se dérouler, monter dans le ciel, où il cachait le soleil.","For a moment, she breathed in front of the door. So he was fighting with an army! When she entered, it was growing and becoming more beautiful. Coupeau was furious, a breakaway from Charenton! He was thrashing about in the middle of the cell, throwing his hands everywhere, at himself, on the walls, on the floor, tumbling, banging into space; and he wanted to open the window, and he hid himself, defended himself, called, answered, all alone to do this Sabbath, with the exasperated air of a man nightmared by a horde of people. Then Gervaise realized that he was imagining himself on a roof, putting up zinc plates. He made the bellows with his mouth, he stirred the irons in the stove, got down on his knees, to run his thumb over the edges of the doormat, thinking he was welding it. Yes, his job came back to him when he died; and if he yelled so loudly, if he clung to his roof, it was because mobs were preventing him from carrying out his work properly. On all the neighboring roofs, there was a scoundrel who was mechanizing it. With that, these pranksters dropped bands of rats in his legs. Ah! the filthy animals, he always saw them! No matter how hard he crushed them, rubbing his foot on the ground with all his might, new strings passed, the roof was black. Weren't there spiders too! He was squeezing his pants roughly to kill large spiders against his thigh, which had crawled there. Sacred thunder ! he would never finish his day, we wanted to lose him, his boss was going to send him to Mazas. Then, as he hurried, he thought he had a steam engine in his stomach; his mouth wide open, he blew smoke, thick smoke that filled the cell and came out the window; and leaning forward, still puffing, he watched the ribbon of smoke unrolling outside, mounting in the sky, where it hid the sun.","When she reached the cell she found Coupeau raving mad! He was fighting in the middle of the cell with invisible enemies. He tried to hide himself; he talked and he answered, as if there were twenty persons. Gervaise watched him with distended eyes. He fancied himself on a roof, laying down the sheets of zinc. He blew the furnace with his mouth, and he went down on his knees and made a motion as if he had soldering irons in his hand. He was troubled by his shoes: it seemed as if he thought they were dangerous. On the next roofs stood persons who insulted him by letting quantities of rats loose. He stamped here and there in his desire to kill them and the spiders too! He pulled away his clothing to catch the creatures who, he said, intended to burrow under his skin. In another minute he believed himself to be a locomotive and puffed and panted. He darted toward the window and looked down into the street as if he were on a roof.","For a moment she stood panting before the door. Was he then fighting against an army? When she entered, the performance had increased and was embellished even more than on previous occasions. Coupeau was a raving madman, the same as one sees at the Charenton mad-house! He was throwing himself about in the center of the cell, slamming his fists everywhere, on himself, on the walls, on the floor, and stumbling about punching empty space. He wanted to open the window, and he hid himself, defended himself, called, answered, produced all this uproar without the least assistance, in the exasperated way of a man beset by a mob of people. Then Gervaise understood that he fancied he was on a roof, laying down sheets of zinc. He imitated the bellows with his mouth, he moved the iron about in the fire and knelt down so as to pass his thumb along the edges of the mat, thinking that he was soldering it. Yes, his handicraft returned to him at the moment of croaking; and if he yelled so loud, if he fought on his roof, it was because ugly scoundrels were preventing him doing his work properly. On all the neighboring roofs were villains mocking and tormenting him. Besides that, the jokers were letting troops of rats loose about his legs. Ah! the filthy beasts, he saw them always! Though he kept crushing them, bringing his foot down with all his strength, fresh hordes of them continued passing, until they quite covered the roof. And there were spiders there too! He roughly pressed his trousers against his thigh to squash some big spiders which had crept up his leg. Mon Dieu! he would never finish his day’s work, they wanted to destroy him, his employer would send him to prison. Then, whilst making haste, he suddenly imagined he had a steam-engine in his stomach; with his mouth wide open, he puffed out the smoke, a dense smoke which filled the cell and found an outlet by the window; and, bending forward, still puffing, he looked outside of the cloud of smoke as it unrolled and ascended to the sky, where it hid the sun."
"Gervaise, calmée, regrettait déjà sa vivacité. Elle aida Coupeau à se remettre debout. Puis, elle tendit la joue en souriant. Mais le zingueur, sans se gêner devant le monde, lui prit les seins.","Gervaise, calmed down, already regretted her vivacity. She helped Coupeau to his feet. Then she held out her cheek, smiling. But the zinc worker, without hesitation in front of the world, took her breasts.","Gervaise already regretted her momentary vexation and assisted her husband to his feet and then turned her cheek to him with a smile, but he put his arm round her and kissed her neck.","Gervaise had calmed down and was already regretting her hastiness. She helped Coupeau up on his legs again. Then she offered her cheek with a smile. But the zinc-worker, without caring a button for the other people being present, seized her bosom."
"- Gervaise, voyons, ne fais pas la bête, répétait-il. Ça sent trop mauvais, tu ne peux pas rester ? Viens. Qu'est-ce que tu crains ? Il ne nous entend pas, va !","""Gervaise, come on, don't be silly,"" he repeated. It smells too bad, can't you stay? Come. What are you afraid of? He does not hear us, go!","Leave me, Auguste. I can manage."" But Lantier would not obey her.","“Come, Gervaise, don’t be foolish,” resumed he. “It’s too abominable; you can’t remain here. Come with me. He won’t hear us. What are you afraid of?” “No,” she replied firmly, shaking her head vigorously."
"Mais un gros silence se fit. Les têtes s'allongeaient, les regards suivaient le couteau. Poisson ménageait une surprise. Brusquement, il donna un dernier coup ; l'arrière-train de la bête se sépara et se tint debout, le croupion en l'air : c'était le bonnet d'évêque. Alors l'admiration éclata. Il n'y avait que les anciens militaires pour être aimables en société. Cependant, l'oie venait de laisser échapper un flot de jus par le trou béant de son derrière ; et Boche rigolait.","But there was a deep silence. Heads lengthened, eyes followed the knife. Poisson was preparing a surprise. Suddenly he gave a final blow; the beast's hindquarters parted and stood upright, rump in the air: it was the bishop's cap. Then admiration burst forth. Only former soldiers were friendly in society. However, the goose had just let out a stream of juice from the gaping hole in her behind; and Boche was laughing.","""If it were only a Cossack!"" At last the goose was carved and distributed, and the whole party ate as if they were just beginning their dinner. Presently there was a grand outcry about the heat, and Coupeau opened the door into the street. Gervaise devoured large slices of the breast, hardly speaking, but a little ashamed of her own gluttony in the presence of Goujet.","A great silence ensued. Necks were stretched out as every eye followed the knife. Poisson was preparing a surprise. Suddenly he gave a last cut; the hind-quarter of the bird came off and stood up on end, rump in the air, making a bishop’s mitre. Then admiration burst forth. None were so agreeable in company as retired soldiers."
"- Non, j'ai marché vite, je n'ai pas eu l'idée de voir.","- No, I walked quickly, I didn't think of seeing.","""I have just seen Lantier pass the door.","“No, I walked quickly, not as if I was looking for him.”"
"Dans son coin de misère, au milieu de ses soucis et de ceux des autres, Gervaise trouvait pourtant un bel exemple de courage chez les Bijard. La petite Lalie, cette gamine de huit ans, grosse comme deux sous de beurre, soignait le ménage avec une propreté de grande personne ; et la besogne était rude, elle avait la charge de deux mioches, son frère Jules et sa sœur Henriette, des mômes de trois ans et de cinq ans, sur lesquels elle devait veiller toute la journée, même en balayant et en lavant la vaisselle. Depuis que le père Bijard avait tué sa bourgeoise d'un coup de pied dans le ventre, Lalie s'était faite la petite mère de tout ce monde. Sans rien dire, d'elle-même, elle tenait la place de la morte, cela au point que sa bête brute de père, pour compléter sans doute la ressemblance, assommait aujourd'hui la fille comme il avait assommé la maman autrefois. Quand il revenait soûl, il lui fallait des femmes à massacrer. Il ne s'apercevait seulement pas que Lalie était toute petite ; il n'aurait pas tapé plus fort sur une vieille peau. D'une claque, il lui couvrait la figure entière, et la chair avait encore tant de délicatesse, que les cinq doigts restaient marqués pendant deux jours. C'étaient des tripotées indignes, des trépignées pour un oui, pour un non, un loup enragé tombant sur un pauvre petit chat, craintif et câlin, maigre à faire pleurer, et qui recevait ça avec ses beaux yeux résignés, sans se plaindre. Non, jamais Lalie ne se révoltait. Elle pliait un peu le cou, pour protéger son visage ; elle se retenait de crier, afin de ne pas révolutionner la maison. Puis, quand le père était las de l'envoyer promener à coups de soulier aux quatre coins de la pièce, elle attendait d'avoir la force de se ramasser ; et elle se remettait au travail, débarbouillait ses enfants, faisait la soupe, ne laissait pas un grain de poussière sur les meubles. Ça rentrait dans sa tâche de tous les jours d'être battue.","In her corner of misery, in the midst of her worries and those of others, Gervaise nevertheless found a fine example of courage in the Bijards. Little Lalie, that little girl of eight, as big as two sous of butter, took care of the housework with the cleanliness of a grown-up; and the job was tough, she had two kids to take care of, her brother Jules and her sister Henriette, three-year-olds and five-year-olds, over whom she had to watch all day, even by sweeping and washing the dishes. Ever since Father Bijard had killed his bourgeoise with a kick in the stomach, Lalie had become everyone's little mother. Without saying a word, of herself, she took the place of the dead, to such an extent that her beastly father, no doubt to complete the resemblance, knocked out the daughter today as he had knocked out the mother in the past. When he came back drunk, he needed women to slaughter. He didn't even notice that Lalie was very small; he couldn't have slapped harder on old skin. With a slap, he covered her entire face, and the flesh still had such delicacy that the five fingers remained marked for two days. They were unworthy gropings, stampings for a yes, for a no, an enraged wolf falling on a poor little cat, fearful and cuddly, thin enough to make you cry, and who received it with her beautiful resigned eyes, without complaining. No, Lalie never rebelled. She bent her neck a little, to protect her face; she refrained from shouting, so as not to upset the house. Then, when the father was tired of kicking her out to the four corners of the room, she waited until she had the strength to pick herself up; and she went back to work, washing her children, making the soup, not leaving a speck of dust on the furniture. It was part of her everyday task to be beaten.","Gervaise had before her a noble example of courage and fortitude in the Bijard family. Little Lalie, that tiny child—about as big as a pinch of salt—swept and kept her room like wax; she watched over the two younger children with all the care and patience of a mother. This she had done since her father had kicked her mother to death. She had entirely assumed that mother's place, even to receiving the blows which had fallen formerly on that poor woman. It seemed to be a necessity of his nature that when he came home drunk he must have some woman to abuse. Lalie was too small, he grumbled; one blow of his fist covered her whole face, and her skin was so delicate that the marks of his five fingers would remain on her cheek for days! He would fly at her like a wolf at a poor little kitten for the merest trifle. Lalie never answered, never rebelled and never complained. She merely tried to shield her face and suppressed all shrieks, lest the neighbors should come; her pride could not endure that. When her father was tired kicking her about the room she lay where he left her until she had strength to rise, and then she went steadily about her work, washing the children and making her soup, sweeping and dusting until everything was clean. It was a part of her plan of life to be beaten every day.","In her corner of misery, in the midst of her cares and the cares of others, Gervaise had, however, a beautiful example of courage in the home of her neighbors, the Bijards. Little Lalie, only eight years old and no larger than a sparrow, took care of the household as competently as a grown person. The job was not an easy one because she had two little tots, her brother Jules and her sister Henriette, aged three and five, to watch all day long while sweeping and cleaning. Ever since Bijard had killed his wife with a kick in the stomach, Lalie had become the little mother of them all. Without saying a word, and of her own accord, she filled the place of one who had gone, to the extent that her brute of a father, no doubt to complete the resemblance, now belabored the daughter as he had formerly belabored the mother. Whenever he came home drunk, he required a woman to massacre. He did not even notice that Lalie was quite little; he would not have beaten some old trollop harder. Little Lalie, so thin it made you cry, took it all without a word of complaint in her beautiful, patient eyes. Never would she revolt. She bent her neck to protect her face and stifled her sobs so as not to alarm the neighbors. When her father got tired of kicking her, she would rest a bit until she got her strength back and then resume her work. It was part of her job, being beaten daily."
"Il serrait les poings ; puis, il poussa un cri rauque, il s'aplatit en courant. Et il bégayait, les dents claquant d'épouvante :","He clenched his fists; then, he uttered a hoarse cry, he flattened himself as he ran. And he stuttered, his teeth chattering in terror:",He started back with a hoarse cry; his teeth chattered with terror.,"He clinched his fists; then he uttered a hoarse cry, stooping as he ran. And he stuttered, his teeth chattering with fright."
"Les quatre croque-morts, qui s'en allaient, rentrèrent pour trinquer avec la société. Ce n'était pas un reproche, mais la dame de tout à l'heure pesait son poids et valait bien un verre de vin. Le père Bazouge regardait fixement la blanchisseuse, sans lâcher un mot déplacé. Elle se leva mal à l'aise, elle quitta les hommes qui achevaient de se cocarder. Coupeau, soûl comme une grive, recommençait à viauper et disait que c'était le chagrin.","The four undertakers, who were leaving, returned to toast with the company. It wasn't a reproach, but the lady from earlier weighed her weight and was well worth a glass of wine. Father Bazouge stared fixedly at the laundress, without saying an inappropriate word. She got up ill at ease, she left the men who were finishing cocking each other. Coupeau, drunk as a thrush, began to roar again and said that it was grief.","It seemed to her that in leaving Mamma Coupeau in the quiet cemetery she had also left much that was precious to her, a portion of her own life, her pride in her shop, her hopes and her energy.","The four undertaker’s helpers, who had started to leave, came back to raise glasses with the group. They thought that the lady had weighed quite a bit and they had certainly earned a glass of wine. Old Bazouge gazed steadily at Gervaise without saying a word. It made her feel uneasy though and she got up and left the men who were beginning to show signs of being drunk. Coupeau began to sob again, saying he was feeling very sad."
- C'est deux gosses qui demandent maman ! cria Charles.,- It's two kids asking for mum! cried Charles.,"""Two children are here asking for their mother!"" cried Charles.",“Here are two brats who want their mamma!” cried Charles.
"Ça, c'était du sérieux. Mais, sacré mâtin ! ça donnait une vraie idée de la chose. Poisson, qui avait voyagé sur mer, dodelinait de la tête pour approuver les détails. On sentait bien, d'ailleurs, que cette chanson-là était dans le sentiment de madame Putois.","That was serious. But, damn it! it gave a real idea of the thing. Poisson, who had traveled by sea, nodded to approve the details. We felt, moreover, that this song was in the spirit of Madame Putois.","Poisson nodded approval. He had been to sea, and he knew all about it.","That was something serious. By Jove! it gave one a fine idea of the real thing. Poisson, who had been on board ship nodded his head in approval of the description. One could see too that that song was in accordance with Madame Putois’s own feeling."
"Elles étaient pressées, eh bien ! quoi ? ce n'était pas sa faute. Il ne faisait rien de mal. Il ne touchait pas, il regardait seulement. Est-ce qu'il n'était plus permis de regarder les belles choses que le bon Dieu a faites ? Elle avait tout de même de sacrés ailerons, cette dessalée de Clémence ! Elle pouvait se montrer pour deux sous et laisser tâter, personne ne regretterait son argent. L'ouvrière, cependant, ne se défendait plus, riait de ces compliments tout crus d'homme en ribote. Et elle en venait à plaisanter avec lui. Il la blaguait sur les chemises d'homme. Alors, elle était toujours dans les chemises d'homme. Mais oui, elle vivait là-dedans. Ah ! Dieu de Dieu ! elle les connaissait joliment, elle savait comment c'était fait. Il lui en avait passé par les mains, et des centaines, et des centaines ! Tous les blonds et tous les bruns du quartier portaient de son ouvrage sur le corps. Pourtant, elle continuait, les épaules secouées de son rire ; elle avait marqué cinq grands plis à plat dans le dos, en introduisant le fer par l'ouverture du plastron ; elle rabattait le pan de devant et le plissait également à larges coups.","They were in a hurry, well! what ? it wasn't his fault. He was doing nothing wrong. He didn't touch, he just looked. Was it no longer allowed to look at the beautiful things that the good Lord had done? She had all the same great fins, this desalinated Clemence! She could show herself for two pennies and let it be felt, no one would regret their money. The workwoman, however, no longer defended herself, laughed at these raw compliments from a drunken man. And she came to joke with him. He was kidding her about men's shirts. So she was still in men's shirts. But yes, she lived in there. Ah! God of God! she knew them nicely, she knew how it was done. He had passed through his hands, and hundreds, and hundreds! All the blondes and all the dark-haired people in the neighborhood wore his work on their bodies. Yet she went on, her shoulders shaking with her laughter; she had made five large folds flat in the back, introducing the iron through the opening of the breastplate; she pulled down the front flap and also pleated it with broad strokes.","""We are in a great hurry today!"" Well, that was not his fault; he did not mean to touch the girl; he only wanted to see what she was about. ""Really,"" said his wife, looking up from her fluting iron, ""I think you had best go to bed."" He began to talk again. ""You need not make such a fuss, Clémence; it is only because these women are here, and—""","They were in a hurry, well! What? It was not his fault. He was doing no harm. He was not touching, he was only looking. Was it no longer allowed to look at the beautiful things that God had made? All the same, she had precious fine arms, that artful Clemence! She might exhibit herself for two sous and nobody would have to regret his money. The girl allowed him to go on, laughing at these coarse compliments of a drunken man. And she soon commenced joking with him. He chuffed her about the shirts. So she was always doing shirts? Why yes, she practically lived in them. Mon Dieu! She knew them pretty well. Hundreds and hundreds of them had passed through her hands. Just about every man in the neighborhood was wearing her handiwork on his body. Her shoulders were shaking with laughter through all this, but she managed to continue ironing."
"Et des souliers lilas, la, la,","And lilac shoes, la, la,",The children were laughing in the courtyard and Nana singing loudly.,She was giving commands in her shrill voice and the children were singing a song about a donkey.
"- Oh ! oh ! murmurait le garçon Charles, émerveillé, les yeux agrandis.","- Oh ! Oh ! murmured the boy Charles, amazed, his eyes wide.","""Oh! Oh!"" murmured Charles with his eyes nearly starting from his head.","“Oh, oh!” exclaimed the boy Charles, opening his eyes to their full extent and gloating over the sight."
"- Qu'est-ce que vous buvez donc là ? demanda-t-elle sournoisement aux hommes, l'œil allumé par la belle couleur d'or de leurs verres.","- So what are you drinking here? she asked the men slyly, her eyes lit by the beautiful gold color of their glasses.","""What is that you have in your glasses?"" she asked.","“What’s that you’re drinking?” asked she slyly of the men, her eyes lighted up by the beautiful golden color of their glasses."
"- Dites donc, monsieur, c'est sérieux alors, cette fois ?","- Say, sir, is it serious then, this time?","""Will he get well, sir?"" she said.","“Tell me, sir, it’s serious then this time?”"
"Le dernier été, pendant lequel Nana traîna chez ses parents les restes de ses nuits, fut surtout mauvais pour Coupeau. Sa voix changea complètement, comme si le fil-en-quatre avait mis une musique nouvelle dans sa gorge. Il devint sourd d'une oreille. Puis, en quelques jours, sa vue baissa ; il lui fallait tenir la rampe de l'escalier, s'il ne voulait pas dégringoler. Quant à sa santé, elle se reposait, comme on dit. Il avait des maux de tête abominables, des étourdissements qui lui faisaient voir trente-six chandelles. Tout d'un coup, des douleurs aiguës le prenaient dans les bras et dans les jambes ; il pâlissait, il était obligé de s'asseoir, et restait sur une chaise hébété pendant des heures ; même, après une de ces crises, il avait gardé son bras paralysé tout un jour. Plusieurs fois, il s'alita ; il se pelotonnait, se cachait sous le drap, avec le souffle fort et continu d'un animal qui souffre. Alors, les extravagances de Sainte-Anne recommençaient. Méfiant, inquiet, tourmenté d'une fièvre ardente, il se roulait dans des rages folles, déchirait ses blouses, mordait les meubles de sa mâchoire convulsée ; ou bien il tombait à un grand attendrissement, lâchant des plaintes de fille, sanglotant et se lamentant de n'être aimé par personne. Un soir, Gervaise et Nana, qui rentraient ensemble, ne le trouvèrent plus dans son lit. A sa place, il avait couché le traversin. Et, quand elles le découvrirent, caché entre le lit et le mur, il claquait des dents, il racontait que des hommes allaient venir l'assassiner. Les deux femmes durent le recoucher et le rassurer comme un enfant.","The last summer, during which Nana dragged the remains of her nights to her parents' house, was especially bad for Coupeau. His voice changed completely, as if the wire-in-four had put new music in his throat. He became deaf in one ear. Then, within a few days, his eyesight failed; he had to hold the handrail of the stairs if he didn't want to tumble. As for her health, she was resting, as they say. He had abominable headaches, dizziness that made him see thirty-six candles. Suddenly sharp pains seized him in his arms and legs; he grew pale, he was forced to sit down, and sat in a chair dazed for hours; even, after one of these crises, he had kept his arm paralyzed a whole day. Several times he took to his bed; he curled up, hid himself under the sheet, with the strong and continuous breathing of an animal in pain. Then the extravagances of Sainte-Anne began again. Suspicious, worried, tormented by a burning fever, he rolled around in mad rages, tore his blouses, bit the furniture with his convulsed jaw; or else he fell into great tenderness, letting out girlish complaints, sobbing and lamenting that he was loved by no one. One evening, Gervaise and Nana, who were going home together, no longer found him in his bed. In its place, he had laid down the bolster. And when they discovered him, hidden between the bed and the wall, his teeth were chattering, he was saying that men were going to come and assassinate him. The two women had to put him back to bed and reassure him like a child.","The last summer of his life was especially trying to Coupeau. His voice was entirely changed; he was deaf in one ear, and some days he could not see and was obliged to feel his way up– and downstairs as if he were blind. He suffered from maddening headaches, and sudden pains would dart through his limbs, causing him to snatch at a chair for support. Sometimes after one of these attacks his arm would be paralyzed for twenty-four hours. He would lie in bed with even his head wrapped up, silent and moody, like some suffering animal. Then came incipient madness and fever—tearing everything to pieces that came in his way—or he would weep and moan, declaring that no one loved him, that he was a burden to his wife. One evening when his wife and daughter came in he was not in his bed; in his place lay the bolster carefully tucked in. They found him at last crouched on the floor under the bed, with his teeth chattering with cold and fear. He told them he had been attacked by assassins. The two women coaxed him back to bed as if he had been a baby.","This last summer, during which Nana usually came home to spend her nights, after she had finished knocking about, was especially bad for Coupeau. His voice changed entirely as if liquor had set a new music in his throat. He became deaf in one ear. Then in a few days his sight grew dim, and he had to clutch hold of the stair railings to prevent himself from falling. As for his health, he had abominable headaches and dizziness. All on a sudden he was seized with acute pains in his arms and legs; he turned pale; was obliged to sit down, and remained on a chair witless for hours; indeed, after one such attack, his arm remained paralyzed for the whole day. He took to his bed several times; he rolled himself up and hid himself under the sheet, breathing hard and continuously like a suffering animal. Then the strange scenes of Sainte-Anne began again. Suspicious and nervous, worried with a burning fever, he rolled about in a mad rage, tearing his blouse and biting the furniture with his convulsed jaws; or else he sank into a great state of emotion, complaining like a child, sobbing and lamenting because nobody loved him. One night when Gervaise and Nana returned home together they were surprised not to find him in his bed. He had laid the bolster in his place. And when they discovered him, hiding between the bed and the wall, his teeth were chattering, and he related that some men had come to murder him. The two women were obliged to put him to bed again and quiet him like a child."
"- Il est trop tard, à cette heure. J'irai chez Bourguignon après le déjeuner. Je dirai que ma bourgeoise a eu des coliques ? Écoutez, père Colombe, je laisse mes outils sous cette banquette, je les reprendrai à midi.","- It's too late at this time. I'll go to Bourguignon's after lunch. I would say that my bourgeoise had colic? Listen, Father Colombe, I'm leaving my tools under this bench, I'll pick them up at noon.","""It is too late to go this morning. I will wait until after breakfast now. I will tell him my wife was sick. Listen, Father Colombe, I will leave my bag of tools under this bench and come for them this afternoon.""","“It’s too late now. I’ll go to Bourguignon’s after lunch. I’ll tell him that the missus was ill. Listen, Pere Colombe, I’ll leave my tools under this seat and I’ll call for them at twelve o’clock.”"
"Le médecin fit une moue. Il demeura encore là deux minutes, les yeux fixés sur Coupeau. Puis, il haussa les épaules, en ajoutant :","The doctor pouted. He remained there for another two minutes, his eyes fixed on Coupeau. Then he shrugged his shoulders, adding:",A dead silence ensued. Then the surgeon shrugged his shoulders.,"The doctor pursed his lips. He continued there another two minutes, his eyes fixed on Coupeau. Then he shrugged his shoulders, adding:"
"Et, baigné de sueur, les cheveux dressés sur le front, effrayant, il s'en alla à reculons, en agitant violemment les bras, comme pour repousser l'abominable scène. Il jeta deux plaintes déchirantes, il s'étala à la renverse sur le matelas, dans lequel ses talons s'étaient empêtrés.","And, bathed in sweat, his hair standing on end, frightening, he went away backwards, waving his arms violently, as if to repel the abominable scene. He uttered two heart-rending complaints, he sprawled backwards on the mattress, in which his heels had become entangled.","He fell back against the wall with his hands wide open before him, as if he were repelling the approach of some frightful object. He uttered two long, low groans and then fell flat on the mattress.","And, covered with perspiration, his hair standing on end, looking a frightful object, he retired backwards, violently waving his arms, as though to send the abominable sight from him. He uttered two heart-rending wails, and fell flat on his back on the mattress, against which his heels had caught."
Gervaise attendit pour dire à son tour :,Gervaise waited to say in her turn:,Gervaise said gently:,Gervaise waited until it was quiet to say:
"L'Assommoir du père Colombe se trouvait au coin de la rue des Poissonniers et du boulevard de Rochechouart. L'enseigne portait, en longues lettres bleues, le seul mot : Distillation, d'un bout à l'autre. Il y avait à la porte, dans deux moitiés de futaille, des lauriers-roses poussiéreux. Le comptoir énorme, avec ses files de verres, sa fontaine et ses mesures d'étain, s'allongeait à gauche en entrant ; et la vaste salle, tout autour, était ornée de gros tonneaux peints en jaune clair, miroitants de vernis, dont les cercles et les cannelles de cuivre luisaient. Plus haut, sur des étagères, des bouteilles de liqueurs, des bocaux de fruits, toutes sortes de fioles en bon ordre, cachaient les murs, reflétaient dans la glace, derrière le comptoir, leurs taches vives, vert pomme, or pâle, laque tendre. Mais la curiosité de la maison était, au fond, de l'autre côté d'une barrière de chêne, dans une cour vitrée, l'appareil à distiller que les consommateurs voyaient fonctionner, des alambics aux longs cols, des serpentins descendant sous terre, une cuisine du diable devant laquelle venaient rêver les ouvriers soûlards.","Father Colombe's Assommoir was at the corner of rue des Poissonniers and boulevard de Rochechouart. The sign bore, in long blue letters, the single word: Distillation, from one end to the other. There were dusty oleanders in two half casks at the door. The enormous counter, with its rows of glasses, its fountain and its pewter measures, stretched out to the left on entering; and the vast room, all around, was adorned with large barrels painted light yellow, shimmering with varnish, whose copper hoops and flutes gleamed. Higher up, on the shelves, bottles of liqueurs, jars of fruit, all sorts of vials in good order, hid the walls, reflected in the mirror, behind the counter, their bright spots, apple green, pale gold, soft lacquer . But the curiosity of the house was, at the back, on the other side of an oak fence, in a glazed courtyard, the distilling apparatus that the consumers saw in operation, stills with long necks, coils descending underground. , a devil's kitchen in front of which the drunken workers came to dream.","Father Colombe's Tavern, known as the Assommoir, was on the corners of the Rue des Poissonnièrs and of the Boulevard de Rochechouart. The sign bore the one single word in long, blue letters: DISTILLATION And this word stretched from one end to the other. On either side of the door stood tall oleanders in small casks, their leaves covered thick with dust. The enormous counter with its rows of glasses, its fountain and its pewter measures was on the left of the door, and the huge room was ornamented by gigantic casks painted bright yellow and highly varnished, hooped with shining copper. On high shelves were bottles of liquors and jars of fruits; all sorts of flasks standing in order concealed the wall and repeated their pale green or deep crimson tints in the great mirror behind the counter. The great feature of the house, however, was the distilling apparatus which stood at the back of the room behind an oak railing on which the tipsy workmen leaned as they stupidly watched the still with its long neck and serpentine tubes descending to subterranean regions—a very devil's kitchen.","Pere Colombe’s l’Assommoir was at the corner of Rue des Poissonniers and Boulevard de Rochechouart. The sign, in tall blue letters stretching from one end to the other said: Distillery. Two dusty oleanders planted in half casks stood beside the doorway. A long bar with its tin measuring cups was on the left as you entered. The large room was decorated with casks painted a gay yellow, bright with varnish, and gleaming with copper taps and hoops. On the shelves above the bar were liquor bottles, jars of fruit preserved in brandy, and flasks of all shapes. They completely covered the wall and were reflected in the mirror behind the bar as colorful spots of apple green, pale gold, and soft brown. The main feature of the establishment, however, was the distilling apparatus. It was at the rear, behind an oak railing in a glassed-in area. The customers could watch its functioning, long-necked still-pots, copper worms disappearing underground, a devil’s kitchen alluring to drink-sodden work men in search of pleasant dreams."
"- Non, non !",- No no !,"""No! No!""","But Gervaise threw herself before him, stammering: “No, no!”"
"M. Madinier, poliment, demanda à prendre la tête du cortège.",M. Madinier politely asked to lead the procession.,"Here Madinier politely asked permission to take the head of the party; the place was so large, he said, that it was a very easy thing to lose oneself; he knew the prettiest rooms and the things best worth seeing, because he had often been there with an artist, a very intelligent fellow, from whom a great manufacturer of pasteboard boxes bought pictures.",Monsieur Madinier politely asked to be their cicerone.
"Mais il fut interrompu par le sergent de ville, dont les moustaches et l'impériale rouges remuaient dans sa face blême.","But he was interrupted by the sergent de ville, whose red mustaches and imperials stirred in his pale face.","Here he was interrupted by Poisson, whose red imperial and mustache irradiated his pale face.",The policeman’s red mustache and beard began to bristle on his pale face and he interrupted:
"Les cascades, qui fuyaient à son approche, s'avançaient quand il reculait. Et, tout d'un coup, il regarda stupidement autour de lui, il balbutia, d'une voix à peine distincte :","The waterfalls, which fled at his approach, advanced when he retreated. And suddenly he looked stupidly around him, he stammered, in a barely distinct voice:","""I am going,"" said Gervaise to the surgeon.","The cascades, which fled at his approach, advanced when he retired. And all of a sudden, he looked stupidly around him, mumbling, in a voice which was scarcely audible:"
"Au milieu de ces histoires, Lantier faisait le gros dos. Il se montrait paternel et digne. A trois reprises, il avait empêché des brouilles entre les Coupeau et les Poisson. Le bon accord des deux ménages entrait dans son contentement. Grâce aux regards tendres et fermes dont il surveillait Gervaise et Virginie, elles affectaient toujours l'une pour l'autre une grande amitié. Lui, régnant sur la blonde et sur la brune avec une tranquillité de pacha, s'engraissait de sa roublardise. Ce mâtin-là digérait encore les Coupeau qu'il mangeait déjà les Poisson. Oh ! ça ne le gênait guère ! une boutique avalée, il entamait une seconde boutique. Enfin, il n'y a que les hommes de cette espèce qui aient de la chance.","In the midst of these stories, Lantier bowed his head. He was paternal and dignified. On three occasions he had prevented a falling out between the Coupeaus and the Poissons. The good agreement of the two households entered into his contentment. Thanks to the tender and firm gaze with which he watched Gervaise and Virginie, they always affected a great friendship for each other. He, reigning over the blonde and the brunette with the tranquility of a pasha, grew fat on his craftiness. That mastiff was still digesting the Coupeau he was already eating the Fish. Oh ! it didn't bother him! one shop swallowed up, he started a second shop. Finally, it is only men of this species who are lucky.","Lantier preserved an attitude of calm indifference. He kept the peace between the Poissons and the Coupeaus. Thanks to him, Virginie and Gervaise affected for each other the most tender regard. He ruled the brunette as he had ruled the blonde, and he would swallow her shop as he had that of Gervaise. It was in June of this year that Nana partook of her first Communion.","In the midst of all this Lantier put on the most consequential airs. He showed himself both paternal and dignified. On three successive occasions he had prevented a quarrel between the Coupeaus and the Poissons. The good understanding between the two families formed a part of his contentment. Thanks to the tender though firm glances with which he watched over Gervaise and Virginie, they always pretended to entertain a great friendship for each other. He reigned over both blonde and brunette with the tranquillity of a pasha, and fattened on his cunning. The rogue was still digesting the Coupeaus when he already began to devour the Poissons. Oh, it did not inconvenience him much! As soon as one shop was swallowed, he started on a second. It was only men of his sort who ever have any luck."
"Oh ! ça ne l'embarrassait pas, il rattraperait les autres ; et il redemanda trois fois du potage, des assiettes de vermicelle, dans lesquelles il coupait d'énormes tranches de pain. Alors, quand on eut attaqué les tourtes, il devint la profonde admiration de toute la table. Comme il bâfrait ! Les garçons effarés faisaient la chaîne pour lui passer du pain, des morceaux finement coupés qu'il avalait d'une bouchée. Il finit par se fâcher ; il voulait un pain à côté de lui. Le marchand de vin, très inquiet, se montra un instant sur le seuil de la salle. La société, qui l'attendait, se tordit de nouveau. Ça la lui coupait au gargotier ! Quel sacré zig tout de même, ce Mes-Bottes ! Est-ce qu'un jour il n'avait pas mangé douze œufs durs et bu douze verres de vin, pendant que les douze coups de midi sonnaient ! On n'en rencontre pas beaucoup de cette force-là. Et mademoiselle Remanjou, attendrie, regardait Mes-Bottes mâcher, tandis que M. Madinier, cherchant un mot pour exprimer son étonnement presque respectueux, déclara une telle capacité extraordinaire.","Oh ! it didn't bother him, he would catch up with the others; and he asked again three times for soup, plates of vermicelli, from which he cut huge slices of bread. Then, when the pies had been attacked, he became the profound admiration of the whole table. How he guzzled! The startled boys lined up to pass him bread, finely cut pieces which he swallowed in one bite. He ends up getting angry; he wanted a loaf beside him. The wine merchant, very worried, appeared for a moment on the threshold of the room. The society that awaited him twisted again. It cut him off at the gargotier! What a hell of a zig all the same, this My-Boots! Hadn't he eaten twelve hard-boiled eggs and drunk twelve glasses of wine one day while the clock struck twelve! You don't find many of that strength. And Mademoiselle Remanjou, moved, watched My Boots chew, while M. Madinier, searching for a word to express his almost respectful astonishment, declared such an extraordinary capacity.",He devoured three plates of soup and enormous slices of bread. The head of the establishment came and looked in in considerable anxiety; a laugh ran around the room. Mes-Bottes recalled to their memories a day when he had eaten twelve hard-boiled eggs and drunk twelve glasses of wine while the clock was striking twelve.,"You see you were expected.” Oh, he did not mind, he would soon catch the others up; and he asked for three helpings of soup, platefuls of vermicelli, in which he soaked enormous slices of bread. Then, when they had attacked the meat pies, he became the profound admiration of everyone at the table. How he stowed it away! The bewildered waiters helped each other to pass him bread, thin slices which he swallowed at a mouthful. He ended by losing his temper; he insisted on having a loaf placed on the table beside him. The landlord, very anxious, came for a moment and looked in at the door. The party, which was expecting him, again wriggled with laughter. It seemed to upset the caterer. What a rum card he was that My-Boots! One day he had eaten a dozen hard-boiled eggs and drank a dozen glasses of wine while the clock was striking twelve! There are not many who can do that. And Mademoiselle Remanjou, deeply moved, watched My-Boots chew whilst Monsieur Madinier, seeking for a word to express his almost respectful astonishment, declared that such a capacity was extraordinary."
"Celui-ci eut un ricanement de satisfaction. Il cria, tout en continuant à pincer les mailles, invisibles entre ses ongles noirs :","He chuckled in satisfaction. He cried, while continuing to pinch the stitches, invisible between his black fingernails:","Lorilleux uttered a little grunt of satisfaction, all the time at work, with the tiny pincers held between very dirty nails.","The latter chuckled with satisfaction. He exclaimed, as he continued squeezing the links, invisible between his black finger-nails."
"- Sacré mâtin ! jura Coupeau, qui piétinait derrière elle, avec une obstination d'ivrogne.","- Damn! swore Coupeau, who was stomping along behind her with the obstinacy of a drunkard.",Gervaise undressed her husband and tucked him up in bed as if he had been a child and then returned to her fluting irons in time to still a grand dispute that was going on about an iron that had not been properly cleaned.,"“By golly!” swore Coupeau, who was treading behind her with the obstinacy of a drunkard."
"- Hein ? des petits pois au lard, dit Virginie. Moi, je ne mangerais que de ça.","- Eh ? peas with bacon, says Virginie. Me, I would eat only that.","""Peas, with a bit of pork,"" said Virginie authoritatively.",“Why not peas with bacon?” said Virginie. “I like nothing better.”
"- Bonsoir, Nana ? Allons, Nana, soyez belle fille ?","- Good evening, Nana? Come on, Nana, be a pretty girl?","Everybody kissed her and then the baby, addressing it with tender epithets, as if it could understand, and departed.","“Good night, Nana. Come be a good girl, Nana.”"
"Mais comme elle se baissait pour rattacher les cordons des souliers d'Etienne, elle vit, à un doigt de Claude, la clef de la chambre avec son numéro de cuivre, qu'il balançait.","But as she bent down to tie the strings of Etienne's shoes, she saw, on Claude's finger, the key to the room with its brass number, which he was swinging.",But as she stooped to tie Etienne's shoes she saw on Claude's finger the key of her room with its copper tag and number.,"But as she stooped to tie the laces of Etienne’s shoes, she saw the key of their room on one of Claude’s fingers, with the brass number hanging from it."
"Mais tout rentra dans l'ordre, Gervaise et maman Coupeau arrivaient pour débrocher l'oie. A la grande table, on respirait, renversé sur les dossiers des chaises. Les hommes déboutonnaient leur gilet, les dames s'essuyaient la figure avec leur serviette. Le repas fut comme interrompu ; seuls, quelques convives, les mâchoires en branle, continuaient à avaler de grosses bouchées de pain, sans même s'en apercevoir. On laissait la nourriture se tasser, on attendait. La nuit, lentement, était tombée ; un jour sale, d'un gris de cendre, s'épaississait derrière les rideaux. Quand Augustine posa deux lampes allumées, une à chaque bout de la table, la débandade du couvert apparut sous la vive clarté, les assiettes et les fourchettes grasses, la nappe tachée de vin, couverte de miettes. On étouffait dans l'odeur forte qui montait. Cependant, les nez se tournaient vers la cuisine, à certaines bouffées chaudes.","But everything was back to normal, Gervaise and Maman Coupeau arrived to unskewer the goose. At the big table, we were breathing, leaning back on the backs of the chairs. The men unbuttoned their waistcoats, the ladies wiped their faces with their napkins. The meal was interrupted; only a few guests, their jaws shaking, continued to swallow large mouthfuls of bread, without even realizing it. We let the food settle, we waited. Night had slowly fallen; a dirty, ash-gray light grew thicker behind the curtains. When Augustine placed two lighted lamps, one at each end of the table, the rout of the place setting appeared under the bright light, the greasy plates and forks, the tablecloth stained with wine, covered with crumbs. We were suffocating in the strong smell that rose. However, noses turned to the kitchen, at certain hot puffs.","Now was the time for the goose. Two lamps were placed on the table, one at each end, and the disorder was very apparent: the cloth was stained and spotted.","But all became quiet again as Gervaise and mother Coupeau came in to get the goose. The guests at the big table were leaning back in their chairs taking a breather. The men had unbuttoned their waistcoats, the ladies were wiping their faces with their napkins. The repast was, so to say, interrupted; only one or two persons, unable to keep their jaws still, continued to swallow large mouthfuls of bread, without even knowing that they were doing so. The others were waiting and allowing their food to settle while waiting for the main course. Night was slowly coming on; a dirty ashy grey light was gathering behind the curtains. When Augustine brought two lamps and placed one at each end of the table, the general disorder became apparent in the bright glare—the greasy forks and plates, the table cloth stained with wine and covered with crumbs. A strong stifling odor pervaded the room. Certain warm fumes, however, attracted all the noses in the direction of the kitchen."
- Encore quatre pieds et demi ? Ça me rapproche de Versailles.,- Another four and a half feet? It brings me closer to Versailles.,"The heat was suffocating; the door could not be opened, because the slightest draft gave Lorilleux a cold.","And he added, with the persistence of a man who does not easily relinquish a joke: “Another four feet and a half. That brings me nearer to Versailles.”"
"La trotte était bonne de la mairie à l'église. En chemin, les hommes prirent de la bière, maman Coupeau et Gervaise du cassis avec de l'eau. Et ils eurent à suivre une longue rue, où le soleil tombait d'aplomb, sans un filet d'ombre. Le bedeau les attendait au milieu de l'église vide ; il les poussa vers une petite chapelle, en leur demandant furieusement si c'était pour se moquer de la religion qu'ils arrivaient en retard. Un prêtre vint à grandes enjambées, l'air maussade, la face pâle de faim, précédé par un clerc en surplis sale qui trottinait. Il dépêcha sa messe, mangeant les phrases latines, se tournant, se baissant, élargissant les bras, en hâte, avec des regards obliques sur les mariés et sur les témoins. Les mariés, devant l'autel, très embarrassés, ne sachant pas quand il fallait s'agenouiller, se lever, s'asseoir, attendaient un geste du clerc. Les témoins, pour être convenables, se tenaient debout tout le temps ; tandis que maman Coupeau, reprise par les larmes, pleurait dans le livre de messe qu'elle avait emprunté à une voisine. Cependant, midi avait sonné, la dernière messe était dite, l'église s'emplissait du piétinement des sacristains, du vacarme, des chaises remises en place. On devait préparer le maître-autel pour quelque fête, car on entendait le marteau des tapissiers clouant des tentures. Et, au fond de la chapelle perdue, dans la poussière d'un coup de balai donné par le bedeau, le prêtre à l'air maussade promenait vivement ses mains sèches sur les têtes inclinées de Gervaise et de Coupeau, semblait les unir au milieu d'un déménagement, pendant une absence du bon Dieu, entre deux messes sérieuses. Quand la noce eut de nouveau signé sur un registre, à la sacristie, et qu'elle se retrouva en plein soleil, sous le porche, elle resta un instant là, ahurie et essoufflée d'avoir été menée au galop.","The walk was good from the town hall to the church. Along the way, the men drank beer, Mama Coupeau and Gervaise blackcurrant with water. And they had to follow a long street, where the sun was falling straight, without a trickle of shadow. The beadle was waiting for them in the middle of the empty church; he pushed them towards a small chapel, asking them furiously if it was to make fun of religion that they had arrived late. A priest came striding forward, sullen, face pale with hunger, preceded by a clerk in a dirty surplice who trotted along. He hurried through his mass, devouring the Latin phrases, turning, stooping, throwing out his arms, hastily, with oblique glances at the bride and groom and at the witnesses. The bride and groom, in front of the altar, very embarrassed, not knowing when to kneel down, get up, sit down, waited for a gesture from the clerk. The witnesses, to be proper, stood all the time; while Mother Coupeau, overcome by tears, wept into the mass book she had borrowed from a neighbour. However, noon had struck, the last mass was said, the church was filled with the trampling of the sextons, the uproar, the chairs being put back in place. The high altar must have been prepared for some feast, for the upholsterers' hammers could be heard nailing hangings. And, at the back of the lost chapel, in the dust of a broom thrown by the beadle, the sullen-looking priest ran his dry hands briskly over the bowed heads of Gervaise and Coupeau, seemed to unite them in the middle of a move, during an absence of the good Lord, between two serious masses. When the wedding party had again signed on a register in the sacristy, and found themselves in the full sun, under the porch, they stood there for a moment, bewildered and out of breath from having been led at a gallop.","It was quite a long walk from the mayor's office to the church. The men stopped midway to take a glass of beer, and Gervaise and Mamma Coupeau drank some cassis with water. There was not a particle of shade, for the sun was directly above their heads. The beadle awaited them in the empty church; he hurried them toward a small chapel, asking them indignantly if they were not ashamed to mock at religion by coming so late. A priest came toward them with an ashen face, faint with hunger, preceded by a boy in a dirty surplice. He hurried through the service, gabbling the Latin phrases with sidelong glances at the bridal party. The bride and bridegroom knelt before the altar in considerable embarrassment, not knowing when it was necessary to kneel and when to stand and not always understanding the gestures made by the clerk. The witnesses thought it more convenient to stand all the time, while Mamma Coupeau, overcome by her tears again, shed them on a prayer book which she had borrowed from a neighbor. It was high noon. The last Mass was said, and the church was noisy with the movements of the sacristans, who were putting the chairs in their places. The center altar was being prepared for some fete, for the hammers were heard as the decorations were being nailed up. And in the choking dust raised by the broom of the man who was sweeping the corner of the small altar the priest laid his cold and withered hand on the heads of Gervaise and Coupeau with a sulky air, as if he were uniting them as a mere matter of business or to occupy the time between the two Masses. When the signatures were again affixed to the register in the vestry and the party stood outside in the sunshine, they had a sensation as if they had been driven at full speed and were glad to rest.","It was a fair walk from the mayor’s office in the town hall to the church. The men stopped along the way to have a beer. Mother Coupeau and Gervaise took cassis with water. Then they had to trudge along the long street where the sun glared straight down without the relief of shade. When they arrived at the church they were hurried along and asked if they came so late in order to make a mockery of religion. A priest came forward, his face pale and resentful from having to delay his lunch. An altar boy in a soiled surplice ran before him. The mass went very fast, with the priest turning, bowing his head, spreading out his arms, making all the ritual gestures in haste while casting sidelong glances at the group. Gervaise and Coupeau, before the altar, were embarrassed, not knowing when they should kneel or rise or seat themselves, expecting some indication from the attendant. The witnesses, not knowing what was proper, remained standing during the ceremony. Mother Coupeau was weeping again and shedding her tears into the missal she had borrowed from a neighbor. Meanwhile, the noon chimes had sounded and the church began to fill with noise from the shuffling feet of sacristans and the clatter of chairs being put back in place. The high altar was apparently being prepared for some special ceremony. Thus, in the depths of this obscure chapel, amid the floating dust, the surly priest placed his withered hands on the bared heads of Gervaise and Coupeau, blessing their union amid a hubbub like that of moving day. The wedding party signed another registry, this time in the sacristy, and then found themselves out in the bright sunlight before the church doors where they stood for a moment, breathless and confused from having been carried along at such a break-neck speed."
"- Ecoute encore, reprit Lalie après un silence. Nous devons quatre francs sept sous au boulanger ; il faudra payer ça ? Madame Gaudron a un fer à nous que tu lui réclameras ? Ce soir, je n'ai pas pu faire de la soupe, mais il reste du pain, et tu mettras chauffer les pommes de terre ?","- Listen again, resumed Lalie after a silence. We owe the baker four francs seven sous; do you have to pay for that? Madame Gaudron has an iron of ours that you will ask her for? Tonight, I couldn't make soup, but there's some bread left, and you'll heat the potatoes?","After a long silence Lalie spoke again: ""We owe four francs and seven sous to the baker. He must be paid. Madame Goudron has an iron that belongs to us; you must not forget it. This evening I was not able to make the soup, but there are bread and cold potatoes.""","“Listen,” resumed Lalie, after a pause. “We owe four francs and seven sous to the baker; you must pay that. Madame Gaudron borrowed an iron of ours, which you must get from her. I wasn’t able to make any soup this evening, but there’s some bread left and you can warm up the potatoes.”"
"Alors, les hommes se levèrent pour prendre leurs pipes. Ils restèrent un instant derrière Mes-Bottes, à lui donner des tapes sur les épaules, en lui demandant si ça allait mieux. Bibi-la-Grillade le souleva avec la chaise ; mais, tonnerre de Dieu ! l'animal avait doublé de poids. Coupeau, par blague, racontait que le camarade commençait seulement à se mettre en train, qu'il allait à présent manger comme ça du pain toute la nuit. Les garçons, épouvantés, disparurent. Boche, descendu depuis un instant, remonta en racontant la bonne tête du marchand de vin, en bas ; il était tout pâle dans son comptoir, la bourgeoise consternée venait d'envoyer voir si les boulangers restaient ouverts, jusqu'au chat de la maison qui avait l'air ruiné. Vrai, c'était trop cocasse, ça valait l'argent du dîner, il ne pouvait pas y avoir de pique-nique sans cet avale-tout de Mes-Bottes. Et les hommes, leurs pipes allumées, le couvaient d'un regard jaloux ; car enfin, pour tant manger, il fallait être solidement bâti !","Then the men got up to take their pipes. They stayed behind My-Boots for a moment, slapping him on the shoulders, asking him if he was feeling better. Bibi-la-Grillade lifted him up with the chair; but, thunder of God! the animal had doubled in weight. Coupeau, jokingly, said that the comrade was just beginning to get going, that he was now going to eat bread like that all night. The boys, terrified, disappeared. Boche, who had been down for a moment, came back up telling the good face of the wine merchant downstairs; he was quite pale in his counter, the dismayed bourgeoise had just sent to see if the bakers were staying open, even the house cat who looked ruined. True, it was too funny, it was worth the money for dinner, there couldn't be a picnic without this swallow-all from My-Boots. And the men, their pipes lighted, gazed at him jealously; for after all, to eat so much, one had to be solidly built!","The men rose to light their pipes and, as they passed Mes-Bottes, asked him how he felt. Bibi-la-Grillade lifted him from the floor, chair and all. ""Zounds!"" he cried. ""The fellow's weight has doubled!"" Coupeau declared his friend had only just begun his night's work, that he would eat bread until dawn. The waiters, pale with fright, disappeared. Boche went downstairs on a tour of inspection and stated that the establishment was in a state of confusion, that the proprietor, in consternation, had sent out to all the bakers in the neighborhood, that the house, in fact, had an utterly ruined aspect.","Then the men rose to get their pipes. They stood for a moment behind My-Boots, patting him on the back, and asking him if he was feeling better. Bibi-the-Smoker lifted him up in his chair; but tonnerre de Dieu! the animal had doubled in weight. Coupeau joked that My-Boots was only getting started, that now he was going to settle down and really eat for the rest of the night. The waiters were startled and quickly vanished from sight. Boche, who had gone downstairs for a moment, came up to report the proprietor’s reaction. He was standing behind his bar, pale as death. His wife, dreadfully upset, was wondering if any bakeries were still open. Even the cat seemed deep in despair. This was as funny as could be, really worth the price of the dinner. It was impossible to have a proper dinner party without My-Boots, the bottomless pit. The other men eyed him with a brooding jealousy as they puffed on their pipes. Indeed, to be able to eat so much, you had to be very solidly built!"
"Il lançait ses poings dans le vide. Alors, une fureur s'empara de lui. Ayant rencontré le mur en reculant, il crut qu'on l'attaquait par-derrière. Il se retourna, s'acharna sur la tenture. Il bondissait, sautait d'un coin à un autre, tapait du ventre, des fesses, d'une épaule, roulait, se relevait. Ses os mollissaient, ses chairs avaient un bruit d'étoupes mouillées. Et il accompagnait ce joli jeu de menaces atroces, de cris gutturaux et sauvages. Cependant, la bataille devait mal tourner pour lui, car sa respiration devenait courte, ses yeux sortaient de leurs orbites ; et il semblait peu à peu pris d'une lâcheté d'enfant.","He threw his fists in the air. Then a fury seized him. Having encountered the wall as he retreated, he thought he was being attacked from behind. He turned around, stalking the hangings. He leapt, jumped from one corner to another, kicked his stomach, buttocks, shoulder, rolled, got up. His bones softened, his flesh sounded like wet tow. And he accompanied this pretty game with atrocious threats, guttural and savage cries. However, the battle was bound to turn out badly for him, as his breathing became short, his eyes popped out of their sockets; and he seemed little by little seized with the cowardice of a child.","Gervaise could not endure the eyes of the young man, for the scene brought back to her so much of her former life. Coupeau fancied, as he had been thrown back from the wall in front, that he was now attacked in the rear, and he leaped over the mattress with the agility of a cat. His respiration grew shorter and shorter, his eyes starting from their sockets.","He hit about in the air viciously. Then a wild rage took possession of him. Having bumped against the wall in walking backwards, he thought he was being attacked from behind. He turned round, and fiercely hammered away at the padding. He sprang about, jumped from one corner to another, knocked his stomach, his back, his shoulder, rolled over, and picked himself up again. His bones seemed softened, his flesh had a sound like damp oakum. He accompanied this pretty game with atrocious threats, and wild and guttural cries. However the battle must have been going badly for him, for his breathing became quicker, his eyes were starting out of his head, and he seemed little by little to be seized with the cowardice of a child."
"- Le bourgeois n'est donc pas là, madame Lantier.","- So the bourgeois is not there, Madame Lantier.","""Lantier has not come in then?""","“So the old man isn’t here, Madame Lantier?”"
"La matinée fut d'une chaleur étouffante. Les ouvrières avaient baissé les jalousies, entre lesquelles elles mouchardaient le mouvement de la rue ; et elles s'étaient enfin mises au travail, rangées des deux côtés de la table, dont madame Lerat occupait seule le haut bout. Elles étaient huit, ayant chacune devant soi son pot à colle, sa pince, ses outils et sa pelote à gaufrer. Sur l'établi traînait un fouillis de fils de fer, de bobines, d'ouate, de papier vert et de papier marron, de feuilles et de pétales, taillés dans de la soie, du satin ou du velours. Au milieu, dans le goulot d'une grande carafe, une fleuriste avait fourré un petit bouquet de deux sous, qui se fanait depuis la veille à son corsage.","The morning was stiflingly hot. The workers had lowered the blinds, between which they sniffed at the movement of the street; and they had at last set to work, ranged on either side of the table, of which Madame Lerat alone occupied the upper end. There were eight of them, each with their glue pot, pliers, tools and embossing ball in front of them. On the workbench lay a jumble of wires, spools, cotton wool, green and brown paper, leaves and petals, cut from silk, satin or velvet. In the middle, in the neck of a large decanter, a florist had stuffed a little two-sou bouquet, which had been fading from her corsage the day before.","The morning was indeed frightfully hot. The workwomen had closed the blinds, leaving a crack, however, through which they could inspect the street, and they took their seats on each side of the table—Mme Lerat at the farther end. There were eight girls, four on either side, each with her little pot of glue, her pincers and other tools; heaps of wires of different lengths and sizes lay on the table, spools of cotton and of different-colored papers, petals and leaves cut out of silk, velvet and satin. In the center, in a goblet, one of the girls had placed a two-sou bouquet,—which was slowly withering in the heat.","It was a stifling hot morning. The workgirls had drawn down the Venetian blinds, between which they could spy out into the street; and they had at last begun working on either side of the table, at the upper end of which sat Madame Lerat. They were eight in number, each with her pot of glue, pincers, tools and curling stand in front of her. On the work-table lay a mass of wire, reels, cotton wool, green and brown paper, leaves and petals cut out of silk, satin or velvet. In the centre, in the neck of a large decanter, one flower-girl had thrust a little penny nosegay which had been fading on her breast since the day before."
"- Ah bien ! s'écria madame Lerat en entrant, nous allons avoir une jolie saucée ! Ça va être drôle !","- Ah well ! exclaimed Madame Lerat as she entered, ""we're going to have a nice sauce!"" It will be funny !","""Ah,"" cried Mme Lerat as she entered, ""we are going to have a tremendous shower!""","“Well!” exclaimed Madame Lerat as she entered, “it’ll pour in torrents soon! That’ll be pleasant!”"
"Madame Boche, pourtant, cherchait le garçon du lavoir.","Madame Boche, however, was looking for the laundry boy.",Mme Boche called to the boy in charge:,"Madame Boche, meanwhile, was trying to discover the wash-house boy."
"Le forgeron, cependant, secoué de la tête aux pieds par un grand frisson, s'écartait d'elle, pour ne pas céder à l'envie de la reprendre ; et il se traînait sur les genoux, ne sachant à quoi occuper ses mains, cueillant des fleurs de pissenlits, qu'il jetait de loin dans son panier. Il y avait là, au milieu de la nappe d'herbe brûlée, des pissenlits jaunes superbes. Peu à peu, ce jeu le calma, l'amusa. De ses doigts raidis par le travail du marteau, il cassait délicatement les fleurs, les lançait une à une, et ses yeux de bon chien riaient, lorsqu'il ne manquait pas la corbeille. La blanchisseuse s'était adossée à l'arbre mort, gaie et reposée, haussant la voix pour se faire entendre, dans l'haleine forte de la scierie mécanique. Quand ils quittèrent le terrain vague, côte à côte, en causant d'Etienne, qui se plaisait beaucoup à Lille, elle emporta son panier plein de fleurs de pissenlits.","The blacksmith, however, shaken from head to foot by a great shiver, moved away from her, so as not to yield to the desire to take her again; and he dragged himself on his knees, not knowing what to do with his hands, picking dandelion flowers, which he threw into his basket from afar. There, in the middle of the sheet of burnt grass, were superb yellow dandelions. Little by little, this game calmed him, amused him. With his fingers stiffened by the work of the hammer, he delicately broke the flowers, threw them one by one, and his eyes of a good dog laughed, when he did not miss the basket. The laundress had leaned against the dead tree, cheerful and rested, raising her voice to make herself heard, in the strong breath of the mechanical sawmill. When they left the vacant lot, side by side, talking about Etienne, who liked Lille very much, she took away her basket full of dandelions.","He began to gather some of the wild daisies, not knowing what to do with his hands, and tossed them into her empty basket. This occupation amused him and tranquillized him. He broke off the head of the flowers and, when he missed his mark and they fell short of the basket, laughed aloud. Gervaise sat with her back against the tree, happy and calm. And when she set forth on her walk home her basket was full of daisies, and she was talking of Etienne.","Goujet now didn’t know what to do with his hands, so he went around picking dandelions and tossing them into her basket. This amused him and gradually soothed him. Gervaise was becoming relaxed and cheerful. When they finally left the vacant lot they walked side by side and talked of how much Etienne liked being at Lille. Her basket was full of yellow dandelions."
"- Eh bien ! ne fais pas la bête, va l'embrasser.","- Well ! don't be silly, go kiss her.","Lantier, grave and silent, stood still.","“Well! Then, don’t stand there like a fool; go and kiss him.”"
- Mais c'est mon sabot ! cria-t-elle furieuse. Ah ! les gredins !,- But it's my hoof! she cried furiously. Ah! the scoundrels!,"""Good heavens!"" she cried. ""It is my shoe they have got.""","And when she understood: “But it’s my shoe!” cried she furiously. “Ah, the rogues!”"
- Voyez donc si mes enfants ne se coupent pas avec leurs ciseaux.,- See if my children do not cut themselves with their scissors.,"""Please see that my children are not cutting themselves with the scissors.""","She paused, then said, “Pray, see if my little ones are not cutting themselves with the scissors.”"
"Elle le regardait toujours ; et, en le voyant si bon, si triste, avec sa belle barbe jaune, elle fut sur le point d'accepter son ancienne proposition, de s'en aller avec lui, pour être heureux ensemble quelque part. Puis, il lui vint une autre mauvaise pensée, celle de lui emprunter ses deux termes, à n'importe quel prix. Elle tremblait, elle reprit d'une voix caressante :","She was still looking at him; and, seeing him so good, so sad, with his beautiful yellow beard, she was on the point of accepting his old proposal, of going away with him, to be happy together somewhere. Then another bad thought occurred to him, that of borrowing his two terms, at any price. She was trembling, she continued in a caressing voice:","Through her mind flitted a vague regret that she had not done as he desired, that she had not gone away with him somewhere. Then a vile temptation assailed her. She trembled.","She gazed at him. He seemed to her such a good man, and sad-looking, and so handsome. She was on the verge of accepting his former proposal, to go away with him and find happiness together somewhere else. Then an evil thought came to her. It was the idea of borrowing the six months’ back rent from him. She trembled and resumed in a caressing tone of voice:"
"Puis, tout haut :","Then, aloud:",Then aloud:,"Then, she observed out loud, “He isn’t nice, then?”"
"- Ah ! on respire, dit Gervaise, sur le trottoir. Eh bien ! adieu, et merci, monsieur Coupeau ? Je rentre vite.","- Oh! one breathes, says Gervaise, on the sidewalk. Well ! farewell, and thank you, Monsieur Coupeau? I come back quickly.","""Ah,"" said Gervaise, drawing a long breath when they stood on the sidewalk, ""here one can breathe again. Good-by, Monsieur Coupeau, and many thanks for your politeness. I must hasten now!""","“Ah,” sighed Gervaise when they reached the sidewalk. “You can breathe out here. Good-bye, Monsieur Coupeau, and thank you. I must hurry now.”"
"Elle avait le cœur tout gonflé, en ne voulant pas avouer qu'elle se brossait le ventre depuis la veille. Puis, elle sentit ses jambes qui se cassaient, elle eut peur de fondre en larmes, bégayant encore :","Her heart was all swollen, not wanting to admit that she had been brushing her belly since the day before. Then, she felt her legs breaking, she was afraid to burst into tears, still stammering:","""I will bring back the ten sous.","Her heart was swelling with the effort she made not to own that she had had nothing to eat since the day before. Then she felt her legs give way. She was frightened that she might burst into tears, and she still stammered:"
"Mais madame Boche, très contrariée de cet arrêt dans les confidences, appela le garçon du lavoir qui passait.","But Madame Boche, very annoyed at this break in confidences, called the laundromat who was passing.","But Mme Boche, much annoyed at this sudden interruption to the long-desired confidence, called the boy.","But Madame Boche, greatly disappointed at this break off in the disclosures, called to the wash-house boy, who was passing, “My little Charles, kindly get madame a pail of hot water; she’s in a hurry.”"
- Monsieur Goujet est donc malade ?,- So Monsieur Goujet is ill?,"""Is Monsieur Goujet ill?""",“Is Monsieur Goujet ill?”
"- Tiens ! fit remarquer Léonie, il a un lorgnon. Oh ! c'est un homme chic ? Il attend Augustine, bien sûr.","- Take ! pointed out Léonie, he has a pair of glasses. Oh ! is he a classy man? He's waiting for Augustine, of course.","He has an eyeglass. Oh, he is very chic. He is waiting for Augustine.","“Ah!” remarked Leonie, “he wears glasses. He’s a swell. He’s waiting for Augustine, no doubt.”"
"Et l'on parla de ficher des claques à Augustine, quand on s'aperçut que la mécanique était rouge. Les fers, eux aussi, rougissaient. Elle avait donc le diable dans le corps ! On ne pouvait pas tourner le dos sans qu'elle fit quelque mauvais coup. Maintenant, il fallait attendre un quart d'heure pour se servir des fers. Gervaise couvrit le feu de deux pelletées de cendre. Elle imagina en outre de tendre une paire de draps sur les fils de laiton du plafond, en manière de stores, afin d'amortir le soleil. Alors, on fut très bien dans la boutique. La température y était encore joliment douce ; mais on se serait cru dans une alcôve, avec un jour blanc, enfermé comme chez soi, loin du monde, bien qu'on entendit, derrière les draps, les gens marchant vite sur le trottoir ; et l'on avait la liberté de se mettre à son aise. Clémence retira sa camisole. Coupeau refusant toujours d'aller se coucher, on lui permit de rester, mais il dut promettre de se tenir tranquille dans un coin, car il s'agissait à cette heure de ne pas s'endormir sur le rôti.","And we talked about slapping Augustine, when we noticed that the mechanism was red. The irons, too, were reddening. So she had the devil in her body! You couldn't turn your back without her doing something bad. Now we had to wait a quarter of an hour to use the irons. Gervaise covered the fire with two shovelfuls of ashes. She also imagined stretching a pair of sheets over the brass wires of the ceiling, like blinds, in order to absorb the sun. So, we were very well in the shop. The temperature there was still pleasantly mild; but you would have thought you were in an alcove, with a white light, shut up like at home, far from the world, although you could hear, behind the sheets, people walking quickly on the sidewalk; and one was free to put oneself at one's ease. Clemence took off her camisole. Coupeau still refusing to go to bed, they allowed him to stay, but he had to promise to keep quiet in a corner, because at this hour it was a question of not falling asleep on the roast.","The stove and the irons were alike red hot; she must wait a quarter of an hour before she could touch the irons, and Gervaise covered the fire with a couple of shovelfuls of cinders.","They talked of boxing Augustine’s ears when they saw that the stove was red-hot. The irons, also, were getting in the same condition. She must have the very devil in her body! One could not turn one’s back a moment without her being up to some of her tricks. Now they would have to wait a quarter of an hour before they would be able to use their irons. Gervaise covered the fire with two shovelfuls of cinders. Then she thought to hang some sheets on the brass wires near the ceiling to serve as curtains to keep out the sunlight. Things were now better in the shop. The temperature was still high, but you could imagine it was cooler. Footsteps could still be heard outside but you were free to make yourself comfortable. Clemence removed her camisole again. Coupeau still refused to go to bed, so they allowed him to stay, but he had to promise to be quiet in a corner, for they were very busy."
"- C'est l'émotion, dit Gervaise, pâle et secouée elle-même.","""It's emotion,"" said Gervaise, pale and shaken herself.","""It is excitement,"" said his mother, who was herself very pale.","“The emotion’s too much for him,” said Gervaise, pale and agitated herself. “Oh!"
"Et elles se sourirent, debout aux deux côtés de cette grande table blanche, où les quatorze couverts alignés leur causaient un gonflement d'orgueil. Ça faisait comme une chapelle, au milieu de la boutique.","And they smiled at each other, standing at either side of this large white table, where the fourteen place settings lined up made them swell with pride. It was like a chapel, in the middle of the shop.",And they smiled as they stood at opposite sides of this long table with its glossy white cloth and its places for fourteen carefully laid. They worshiped there as if it had been a chapel erected in the middle of the shop.,"And they smiled to each other as they stood up on either side of that big white table on which the fourteen knives and forks, placed all round, caused them to swell with pride. It had the appearance of the altar of some chapel in the middle of the shop."
"Mais Bec-Salé, dit Boit-sans-Soif, demanda encore :","But Bec-Salé, known as Boit-sans-Soif, asked again:","he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","But Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst, asked: “So we strike together?”"
"Gervaise joignit les mains, les larmes aux yeux, muette et l'implorant. D'un hochement énergique de sa grosse tête osseuse, il lui fit comprendre que les supplications étaient inutiles. D'ailleurs, le respect dû aux morts interdisait toute discussion. Il se retira discrètement, à reculons.","Gervaise clasped her hands, tears in her eyes, silent and imploring him. With an energetic nod of his big bony head, he made her understand that the pleas were useless. Moreover, the respect due to the dead forbade any discussion. He withdrew discreetly, backwards.","Gervaise clasped her hands imploringly, but he shook his head, saying that discussion was useless; besides, just then it would be a disrespect to the dead. ""A thousand pardons!""","Gervaise, struck dumb, imploringly clasped her hands, her eyes full of tears. With an energetic shake of his big bony head, he gave her to understand that supplications were useless. Besides, the respect due to the dead forbade all discussion. He discreetly retired, walking backwards."
"Mais voilà que, dans l'allée, elle aperçut le monsieur planté comme un cierge, en train de jouer de la prunelle avec Nana ! La petite devint très rouge. Sa tante lui prit le bras d'une secousse, la fit trotter sur le pavé, tandis que le particulier emboîtait le pas. Ah ! le matou venait pour Nana ! Eh bien ! c'était gentil, à quinze ans et demi, de traîner ainsi des hommes à ses jupes ! Et madame Lerat, vivement, la questionnait. Oh ! mon Dieu ! Nana ne savait pas : il la suivait depuis cinq jours seulement, elle ne pouvait plus mettre le nez dehors, sans le rencontrer dans ses jambes ; elle le croyait dans le commerce, oui, un fabricant de boutons en os. Madame Lerat fut très impressionnée. Elle se retourna, guigna le monsieur du coin de l'œil.","But now, in the alley, she saw the gentleman planted like a candle, playing the pupil with Nana! The little one turned very red. Her aunt took her arm with a jerk, made her trot on the pavement, while the private fell in step. Ah! the cat was coming for Nana! Well ! it was nice, at fifteen and a half, to drag men around like that! And Madame Lerat questioned her eagerly. Oh ! my God ! Nana didn't know: he had been following her for only five days, she could no longer put her nose outside without meeting him in her legs; she believed him to be in the trade, yes, a maker of bone buttons. Madame Lerat was very impressed. She turned around, peered at the gentleman out of the corner of her eye.","Lo, in the lane running up by the shop was the mysterious stranger. Nana turned very red, and her aunt drew her arm within her own and hurried her along. So then he had come for her! Was not this pretty behavior for a girl of her age? And Mme Lerat asked question after question, but Nana knew nothing of him, she declared, though he had followed her for five days. Mme Lerat looked at the man out of the corners of her eyes.","But in the passage below she perceived the gentleman, stuck there like a candle and exchanging glances with Nana. The girl flushed very red, whereupon her aunt at once caught her by the arm and made her trot over the pavement, whilst the individual followed behind. Ah! so the tom cat had come for Nana. Well, that was nice! At fifteen years and a half to have men trailing after her! Then Madame Lerat hastily began to question her. Mon Dieu! Nana didn’t know; he had only been following her for five days, but she could not poke her nose out of doors without stumbling on men. She believed he was in business; yes, a manufacturer of bone buttons. Madame Lerat was greatly impressed. She turned round and glanced at the gentleman out of the corner of her eye."
"- Vous savez, continua-t-il, maintenant, je travaille là, à l'hôpital ? Hein ! quel joli mois de mai ! Ça pique dur, ce matin.","- You know, he continued, now I work here, at the hospital? Eh ! what a lovely month of May! It stings hard this morning.","""You know,"" he continued, ""that I am working nowadays at the hospital. What a May this is! The air positively stings one this morning.""","“You know,” he continued, “I’m now working over there in the hospital. What beautiful May weather, isn’t it? The air is rather sharp this morning.”"
"- Pour tout de suite, si tu veux, grand bébé ! répondit Bec-Salé, dit Boit-sans-Soif. Ça tète son pouce et ça fait l'homme ! Tu as beau être gros, j'en ai mangé d'autres !","- For now, if you want, big baby! answered Bec-Salé, said Drink-without-Thirst. It sucks its thumb and it makes the man! You may be fat, I ate others!","he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","replied Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst. “It sucks it’s thumb and thinks itself a man. In spite of your size I’m equal to you!”"
"- Oh ! il y a bien tout, répondit Gervaise en souriant. Vous savez que je ne laisse rien en arrière.","- Oh ! there's everything, replied Gervaise, smiling. You know I leave nothing behind.","""Everything is here,"" answered Gervaise with a smile. ""You know I never leave anything behind.""","“Oh! yes, everything is here,” replied Gervaise smiling. “You know I never leave anything behind.”"
On recueillit la pauvre enfant ?,We took in the poor child?,"Gervaise pressed her hands over her eyes; suddenly all was quiet, and she opened her eyes again and looked out.","Madame Lerat’s voice rose higher and higher, warbling another verse."
"Le chapelier l'attendait sous la porte, bien mis, sifflant un air. Elle avait sa robe de soie. Ils suivirent doucement le trottoir, serrés l'un contre l'autre, éclairés par les coups de lumière des boutiques, qui les montraient se parlant à demi-voix, avec un sourire.","The hatter was waiting for him under the door, well dressed, whistling a tune. She had on her silk dress. They walked slowly along the sidewalk, huddled together, lit by the flashes of light from the shops, which showed them talking to each other in low tones, with a smile.","Lantier stood whistling while she gave these directions. Gervaise wore her silk dress, and she smiled as they walked down the street in alternate shadow and light from the shopwindows.","The hatter was waiting for her under the big doorway, arrayed in his best and whistling a tune. She had on her silk dress. They walked slowly along the pavement, keeping close to each other, lighted up by the glare from the shop windows which showed them smiling and talking together in low voices."
"- Oh ! bien sûr, non, monsieur Coupeau, répondit tranquillement Gervaise souriante. Vous n'allez peut-être pas me parler de ça ici. Vous m'aviez promis pourtant d'être raisonnable ? Si j'avais su, j'aurais refusé votre consommation.","- Oh ! Of course not, Monsieur Coupeau, calmly replied Gervaise, smiling. You may not talk to me about that here. But you promised me to be reasonable? If I had known, I would have refused your drink.","""Of course. No it must be, Monsieur Coupeau,"" answered Gervaise with a smile. ""Surely you do not intend to begin that again here! You promised to be reasonable too. Had I known, I should certainly have refused your treat.""","you say ‘no’?” “Oh! most decidedly ‘no’ Monsieur Coupeau,” quietly replied Gervaise with a smile. “I hope you’re not going to talk to me about that here. You know you promised me you would be reasonable. Had I known, I wouldn’t have let you treat me.”"
"- Mille pardons de vous avoir dérangés, murmura-t-il. Après-demain matin, n'oubliez pas.","- A thousand pardons for having disturbed you, he murmured. Day after tomorrow morning, don't forget.","he said as he went out. "" But remember that I must have the money tomorrow.""","“A thousand pardons for having disturbed you,” murmured he. “The morning after to-morrow; do not forget.”"
- Cache donc ta menteuse ! lui criait sa mère.,- So hide your liar! his mother shouted at him.,"She had a quaint little trick of sticking out the tip of her tongue between her white teeth, and this habit, for some reason, exasperated her mother.",“Hide your lying tongue!” cried her mother.
"Au deuxième verre, Gervaise ne sentit plus la faim qui la tourmentait. Maintenant, elle était raccommodée avec Coupeau, elle ne lui en voulait plus de son manque de parole. Ils iraient au Cirque une autre fois ; ce n'était pas si drôle, des faiseurs de tours qui galopaient sur des chevaux. Il ne pleuvait pas chez le père Colombe, et si la paie fondait dans le fil-en-quatre, on se la mettait sur le torse au moins, on la buvait limpide et luisante comme du bel or liquide. Ah ! elle envoyait joliment flûter le monde ! La vie ne lui offrait pas tant de plaisirs ; d'ailleurs, ça lui semblait une consolation d'être de moitié dans le nettoyage de la monnaie. Puisqu'elle était bien, pourquoi donc ne serait-elle pas restée ? On pouvait tirer le canon, elle n'aimait plus bouger, quand elle avait fait son tas. Elle mijotait dans une bonne chaleur, son corsage collé à son dos, envahie d'un bien-être qui lui engourdissait les membres. Elle rigolait toute seule, les coudes sur la table, les yeux perdus, très amusée par deux clients, un gros mastoc et un nabot, à une table voisine, en train de s'embrasser comme du pain, tant ils étaient gris. Oui, elle riait à l'Assommoir, à la pleine lune du père Colombe, une vraie vessie de saindoux, aux consommateurs fumant leur brûle-gueule, criant et crachant, aux grandes flammes du gaz qui allumaient les glaces et les bouteilles de liqueur. L'odeur ne la gênait plus ; au contraire, elle avait des chatouilles dans le nez, elle trouvait que ça sentait bon ; ses paupières se fermaient un peu, tandis qu'elle respirait très court, sans étouffement, goûtant la jouissance du lent sommeil dont elle était prise. Puis, après son troisième petit verre, elle laissa tomber son menton sur ses mains, elle ne vit plus que Coupeau et les camarades ; et elle demeura nez à nez avec eux, tout près, les joues chauffées par leur haleine, regardant leurs barbes sales, comme si elle en avait compté les poils. Ils étaient très soûls, à cette heure. Mes-Bottes bavait, la pipe aux dents, de l'air muet et grave d'un bœuf assoupi. Bibi-la-Grillade racontait une histoire, la façon dont il vidait un litre d'un trait, en lui fichant un tel baiser à la régalade, qu'on lui voyait le derrière.","After the second glass, Gervaise no longer felt the hunger that tormented her. Now she was reconciled with Coupeau, she was no longer angry with him for his lack of words. They would go to the Circus another time; it wasn't so funny, tricksters galloping on horses. It wasn't raining at Père Colombe's, and if the pay melted in the fil-en-quatre, we put it on our chests at least, we drank it limpid and glistening like beautiful liquid gold. Ah! she sent the world flying pretty! Life did not offer him so many pleasures; besides, it seemed to him a consolation to be halfway in the cleaning of the currency. Since she was fine, why shouldn't she have stayed? You could fire the cannon, she didn't like to move anymore, when she had made her pile. She was simmering in a good heat, her bodice stuck to her back, invaded by a well-being that numbed her limbs. She was laughing to herself, her elbows on the table, her eyes lost, very amused by two customers, a big juggernaut and a dwarf, at a nearby table, kissing each other like bread, they were so tipsy. Yes, she laughed at L'Assommoir, at the full moon of Père Colombe, a real bladder of lard, at the consumers smoking their burners, shouting and spitting, at the great flames of the gas which lit the ice creams and the bottles of liqueur. The smell no longer bothered her; on the contrary, she had tickles in her nose, she thought it smelled good; her eyelids closed a little, while she breathed very quickly, without suffocation, enjoying the pleasure of the slow sleep she was seized with. Then, after her third little glass, she let her chin fall on her hands, she saw only Coupeau and the comrades; and she stood face to face with them, close by, her cheeks warm with their breath, looking at their dirty beards, as if she had counted their hairs. They were very drunk at this hour. My-Boots drooled, his pipe between his teeth, with the silent and grave air of a drowsy ox. Bibi-la-Grillade was telling a story, the way he emptied a liter in one gulp, giving her such a delicious kiss that you could see her behind.","After she had drunk this glass Gervaise was no longer conscious of the hunger that had tormented her. Coupeau told her they could go to the circus another time, and she felt she had best stay where she was. It did not rain in the Assommoir, and she had come to look upon the scene as rather amusing. She was comfortable and sleepy. She took a third glass and then put her head on her folded arms, supporting them on the table, and listened to her husband and his friends as they talked. Behind her the still was at work with constant drip-drip, and she felt a mad desire to grapple with it as with some dangerous beast and tear out its heart.","At the second glass Gervaise no longer felt the hunger which had been tormenting her. Now she had made it up with Coupeau, she no longer felt angry with him for not having kept his word. They would go to the circus some other day; it was not so funny to see jugglers galloping about on houses. There was no rain inside Pere Colombe’s and if the money went in brandy, one at least had it in one’s body; one drank it bright and shining like beautiful liquid gold. Ah! she was ready to send the whole world to blazes! Life was not so pleasant after all, besides it seemed some consolation to her to have her share in squandering the cash. As she was comfortable, why should she not remain? One might have a discharge of artillery; she did not care to budge once she had settled in a heap. She nursed herself in a pleasant warmth, her bodice sticking to her back, overcome by a feeling of comfort which benumbed her limbs. She laughed all to herself, her elbows on the table, a vacant look in her eyes, highly amused by two customers, a fat heavy fellow and a tiny shrimp, seated at a neighboring table, and kissing each other lovingly. Yes, she laughed at the things to see in l’Assommoir, at Pere Colombe’s full moon face, a regular bladder of lard, at the customers smoking their short clay pipes, yelling and spitting, and at the big flames of gas which lighted up the looking-glasses and the bottles of liqueurs. The smell no longer bothered her, on the contrary it tickled her nose, and she thought it very pleasant. Her eyes slightly closed, whilst she breathed very slowly, without the least feeling of suffocation, tasting the enjoyment of the gentle slumber which was overcoming her. Then, after her third glass, she let her chin fall on her hands; she now only saw Coupeau and his comrades, and she remained nose to nose with them, quite close, her cheeks warmed by their breath, looking at their dirty beards as though she had been counting the hairs. My-Boots drooled, his pipe between his teeth, with the dumb and grave air of a dozing ox. Bibi-the-Smoker was telling a story—the manner in which he emptied a bottle at a draught, giving it such a kiss that one instantly saw its bottom."
"Et maman Coupeau alla chercher une seconde fois l'oie grasse, que Virginie dut prendre sur ses mains. Elle s'exclama. « Sacredié ! qu'elle était lourde ! » Mais elle la posa tout de suite au bord de l'établi, entre un jupon et un paquet de chemises. Elle avait la cervelle ailleurs ; elle emmena Gervaise dans la chambre du fond.","And Maman Coupeau went to fetch the fat goose a second time, which Virginie had to take in her hands. She exclaimed. “Sacred! how heavy it was! But she immediately put it on the edge of the workbench, between a petticoat and a bundle of shirts. Her brains were elsewhere; she led Gervaise into the back bedroom.","Mamma Coupeau, show her the goose,"" cried Gervaise. Virginie admired it, guessed the weight and laid it down on the ironing table between an embroidered skirt and a pile of shirts. She was evidently thinking of something else. She soon led Gervaise into the back shop.","And mother Coupeau went a second time and fetched the goose, which Virginie had to take in her hands. She uttered no end of exclamations. By Jove! It was heavy! But she soon laid it down on the work-table, between a petticoat and a bundle of shirts. Her thoughts were elsewhere. She dragged Gervaise into the back-room."
"- Tenez, mettez donc des cristaux, j'en ai là, dit obligeamment la concierge.","- Here, put crystals, I have some here, said the concierge obligingly.","""Here, take some of this,"" said the concierge as she emptied into the water that Gervaise was using the remains of a package of bicarbonate of soda.","“Here put some soda in, I’ve got some by me,” said the concierge, obligingly."
"- C'est une sœur, maintenant, rien qu'une sœur ! murmura à son tour Lantier.","- She's a sister now, just a sister! muttered Lantier in his turn.","""I regard her as a sister,"" said Lantier, ""only as a sister.""",“She is a sister now—nothing but a sister!” murmured Lantier in his turn.
"- En v'là des punaises ! ? Rappliquez un peu par ici, que je vous désosse ! ? Ah ! ils veulent m'escoffier, ah ! les punaises ! ? Je suis plus rupin que vous tous ! Décarrez, nom de Dieu !","- There are bugs! ? Come around here a bit, let me bone you! ? Ah! they want to evade me, ah! bedbugs! ? I'm more rude than all of you! Discard, for God's sake!",When she reached the cell she found Coupeau raving mad!,"“What a lot of bugs!—Come this way again that I may squash you!—Ah! they want to kill me! ah! the bugs!—I’m a bigger swell than the lot of you! Clear out, damnation! Clear out.”"
"Lantier eut le bec cloué par cette réponse. Il rangea ses livres et ses journaux sur une planche de l'armoire ; et comme il paraissait désolé de ne pas avoir une petite bibliothèque, pendue au-dessus de la table, Gervaise promit de lui en procurer une. Il possédait l'Histoire de dix ans, de Louis Blanc, moins le premier volume, qu'il n'avait jamais eu d'ailleurs, Les Girondins, de Lamartine, en livraisons à deux sous, Les Mystères de Paris et Le Juif errant, d'Eugène Sue, sans compter un tas de bouquins philosophiques et humanitaires, ramassés chez les marchands de vieux clous. Mais il couvait surtout ses journaux d'un regard attendri et respectueux. C'était une collection faite par lui, depuis des années. Chaque fois qu'au café il lisait dans un journal un article réussi et selon ses idées, il achetait le journal, il le gardait. Il en avait ainsi un paquet énorme de toutes les dates et de tous les titres, empilés sans ordre aucun. Quand il eut sortit ce paquet du fond de la malle, il donna dessus des tapes amicales, en disant aux deux autres :","Lantier had his beak nailed by this answer. He put his books and newspapers away on a shelf in the cupboard; and as he seemed sorry not to have a little bookcase hanging over the table, Gervaise promised to get him one. He owned the Histoire de dix ans, by Louis Blanc, minus the first volume, which he had never had elsewhere, Les Girondins, by Lamartine, in two-penny deliveries, Les Mystères de Paris and Le Juif errant. , by Eugène Sue, not to mention a whole heap of philosophical and humanitarian books, picked up from dealers selling old nails. But above all he brooded over his newspapers with a tender and respectful gaze. It was a collection made by him, for years. Each time at the cafe he read a successful article in a newspaper and according to his ideas, he bought the newspaper, he kept it. He thus had a huge pile of all the dates and all the titles, piled up without any order. When he had taken this package from the bottom of the trunk, he gave it friendly pats, saying to the two others:","Lantier, with a laugh of triumph, turned away and began to pile up his books and papers, grumbling a little that there were no shelves on which to put them. Gervaise promised to buy some for him. He owned Louis Blanc's Histoire de Dix Ans, all but the first volume, which he had never had, Lamartine's Les Girondins, The Mysteries of Paris and The Wandering Jew, by Eugene Sue, without counting a pile of incendiary volumes which he had picked up at bookstalls. His old newspapers he regarded with especial respect. He had collected them with care for years: whenever he had read an article at a cafe of which he approved, he bought the journal and preserved it. He consequently had an enormous quantity, of all dates and names, tied together without order or sequence. He laid them all in a corner of the room, saying as he did so:","Lantier didn’t reply. He busied himself arranging his books and newspapers on a shelf in the wardrobe. He seemed upset not to have a small bookshelf over his table, so Gervaise promised to get him one. He had “The History of Ten Years” by Louis Blanc (except for the first volume), Lamartine’s “The Girondins” in installments, “The Mysteries of Paris” and “The Wandering Jew” by Eugene Sue, and a quantity of booklets on philosophic and humanitarian subjects picked up from used book dealers. His newspapers were his prized possessions, a collection made over a number of years. Whenever he read an article in a cafe that seemed to him to agree with his own ideas, he would buy that newspaper and keep it. He had an enormous bundle of them, papers of every date and every title, piled up in no discernable order. He patted them and said to the other two:"
"- Alors, nous frappons ensemble ?",- So we hit together?,"he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","But Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst, asked: “So we strike together?”"
"Il a bien mai au ventre,","He has a good stomach,","Then Mme Lorilleux fell to crying, and Lantier had great trouble in preventing her from going away at once, and the quarrel grew so violent that Mme Lerat hastily closed the door of the room where the dead woman lay, as if she feared the noise would waken her.","Just at this moment the girls playing in the courtyard, led by Nana, began singing again."
"En décembre, un soir, on dîna par cœur. Il n'y avait plus un radis, Lantier, très sombre, sortait de bonne heure, battait le pavé pour trouver une autre cambuse, où l'odeur de la cuisine déridât les visages. Il restait des heures à réfléchir, près de la mécanique. Puis, tout d'un coup, il montra une grande amitié pour les Poisson. Il ne blaguait plus le sergent de ville en l'appelant Badingue, allait jusqu'à lui concéder que l'empereur était un bon garçon, peut-être. Il paraissait surtout estimer Virginie, une femme de tête, disait-il, et qui saurait joliment mener sa barque. C'était visible, il les pelotait. Même on pouvait croire qu'il voulait prendre pension chez eux. Mais il avait une caboche à double fond, beaucoup plus compliquée que ça. Virginie lui ayant dit son désir de s'établir marchande de quelque chose, il se roulait devant elle, il déclarait ce projet-là très fort. Oui, elle devait être bâtie pour le commerce, grande, avenante, active. Oh ! elle gagnerait ce qu'elle voudrait. Puisque l'argent était prêt depuis longtemps, l'héritage d'une tante, elle avait joliment raison de lâcher les quatre robes qu'elle bâclait par saison, pour se lancer dans les affaires ; et il citait des gens en train de réaliser des fortunes, la fruitière du coin de la rue, une petite marchande de faïence du boulevard extérieur ; car le moment était superbe, on aurait vendu les balayures des comptoirs. Cependant, Virginie hésitait ; elle cherchait une boutique à louer, elle désirait ne pas quitter le quartier. Alors, Lantier l'emmena dans les coins, causa tout bas avec elle pendant des dix minutes. Il semblait lui pousser quelque chose de force, et elle ne disait plus non, elle avait l'air de l'autoriser à agir. C'était comme un secret entre eux, avec des clignements d'yeux, des mots rapides, une sourde machination qui se trahissait jusque dans leurs poignées de main. Dès ce moment, le chapelier, en mangeant son pain sec, guetta les Coupeau de son regard en dessous, redevenu très parleur, les étourdissant de ses jérémiades continues. Toute la journée, Gervaise marchait dans cette misère qu'il étalait complaisamment. Il ne parlait pas pour lui, grand Dieu ! Il crèverait la faim avec les amis tant qu'on voudrait. Seulement, la prudence exigeait qu'on se rendit compte au juste de la situation. On devait pour le moins cinq cents francs dans le quartier, au boulanger, au charbonnier, à l'épicier et aux autres. De plus, on se trouvait en retard de deux termes, soit encore deux cent cinquante francs ; le propriétaire, M. Marescot, parlait même de les expulser, s'ils ne le payaient pas avant le 1er janvier. Enfin, le Mont-de-Piété avait tout pris, on n'aurait pas pu y porter pour trois francs de bibelots, tellement le lavage du logement était sérieux ; les clous restaient aux murs, pas davantage, et il y en avait bien deux livres de trois sous.","In December, one evening, we dined by heart. There was no longer a radish, Lantier, very somber, would go out early, pound the pavement to find another lazarette, where the smell of the cooking would make their faces wrinkled. He remained for hours to reflect, close to the mechanics. Then, all of a sudden, he showed great friendship for Pisces. He no longer joked about the sergent de ville by calling him Badingue, went so far as to concede to him that the Emperor was a good boy, perhaps. Above all, he seemed to esteem Virginie, a strong woman, he said, who would know how to steer her boat nicely. It was visible, he was groping them. You could even believe that he wanted to board with them. But he had a false bottom noggin, much more complicated than that. Virginie having told him of her desire to establish herself as a dealer in something, he rolled over in front of her, he declared this project very strong. Yes, she had to be built for business, tall, pleasant, active. Oh ! she would earn what she wanted. Since the money had been ready for a long time, an inheritance from an aunt, she was perfectly right to drop the four dresses she botched each season, to go into business; and he quoted people making fortunes, the greengrocer on the corner of the street, a little pottery seller on the outer boulevard; because the moment was superb, we would have sold the sweepings of the counters. However, Virginie hesitated; she was looking for a shop to rent, she didn't want to leave the neighborhood. Then Lantier took her into the corners, chatted in a low voice with her for ten minutes. He seemed to force something at her, and she no longer said no, she seemed to authorize him to act. It was like a secret between them, with blinks, quick words, a deaf plot that betrayed itself even in their handshakes. From that moment, the hatter, while eating his dry bread, watched the Coupeaus with his gaze below, becoming very talkative again, deafening them with his continuous jeremiads. All day Gervaise walked in this misery which he complacently displayed. He did not speak for himself, great God! He would starve with friends as long as we wanted. However, prudence demanded that we take stock of the situation. We owed at least five hundred francs in the neighborhood, to the baker, the coalman, the grocer and the others. Moreover, we were two terms late, that is another two hundred and fifty francs; the owner, M. Marescot, even spoke of evicting them if they did not pay him before January 1st. Finally, the Mont-de-Piété had taken everything, we couldn't have brought trinkets there for three francs, so serious was the cleaning of the lodgings; the nails remained on the walls, no more, and there were indeed two pounds of three sous.","One day it came to pass that there was not a mouthful in the house, not even a radish. Lantier sat by the stove in somber discontent. Finally he started up and went to call on the Poissons, to whom he suddenly became friendly to a degree. He no longer taunted the police officer but condescended to admit that the emperor was a good fellow after all. He showed himself especially civil to Virginie, whom he considered a clever woman and well able to steer her bark through stormy seas. Virginie one day happened to say in his presence that she should like to establish herself in some business. He approved the plan and paid her a succession of adroit compliments on her capabilities and cited the example of several women he knew who had made or were making their fortunes in this way. Virginie had the money, an inheritance from an aunt, but she hesitated, for she did not wish to leave the Quartier and she did not know of any shop she could have. Then Lantier led her into a corner and whispered to her for ten minutes; he seemed to be persuading her to something. They continued to talk together in this way at intervals for several days, seeming to have some secret understanding. Lantier all this time was fretting and scolding at the Coupeaus, asking Gervaise what on earth she intended to do, begging her to look things fairly in the face. She owed five or six hundred francs to the tradespeople about her. She was behindhand with her rent, and Marescot, the landlord, threatened to turn her out if they did not pay before the first of January. The Mont-de-Piété had taken everything; there was literally nothing but the nails in the walls left.","One evening in December they had no dinner at all. There was not a radish left. Lantier, who was very glum, went out early, wandering about in search of some other den where the smell of the kitchen would bring a smile to one’s face. He would now remain for hours beside the stove wrapt in thought. Then, suddenly, he began to evince a great friendship for the Poissons. He no longer teased the policeman and even went so far as to concede that the Emperor might not be such a bad fellow after all. He seemed to especially admire Virginie. No doubt he was hoping to board with them. Virginie having acquainted him with her desire to set up in some sort of business, he agreed with everything she said, and declared that her idea was a most brilliant one. She was just the person for trade—tall, engaging and active. Oh! she would make as much as she liked. The capital had been available for some time, thanks to an inheritance from an aunt. Lantier told her of all the shopkeepers who were making fortunes. The time was right for it; you could sell anything these days. Virginie, however, hesitated; she was looking for a shop that was to be let, she did not wish to leave the neighborhood. Then Lantier would take her into corners and converse with her in an undertone for ten minutes at a time. He seemed to be urging her to do something in spite of herself; and she no longer said “no,” but appeared to authorize him to act. It was as a secret between them, with winks and words rapidly exchanged, some mysterious understanding which betrayed itself even in their handshakings. From this moment the hatter would covertly watch the Coupeaus whilst eating their dry bread, and becoming very talkative again, would deafen them with his continual jeremiads. All day long Gervaise moved in the midst of that poverty which he so obligingly spread out. Mon Dieu! he wasn’t thinking of himself; he would go on starving with his friends as long as they liked. But look at it with common sense. They owed at least five hundred francs in the neighborhood. Besides which, they were two quarters’ rent behind with the rent, which meant another two hundred and fifty francs; the landlord, Monsieur Marescot, even spoke of having them evicted if they did not pay him by the first of January. Finally the pawn-place had absorbed everything, one could not have got together three francs’ worth of odds and ends, the clearance had been so complete; the nails remained in the walls and that was all and perhaps there were two pounds of them at three sous the pound."
"- Hop ! hop ! gueulait-il, c'est la course des bourriques ! ? Hein ? très chouette, le matin, en hiver ; je fais dodo, je ne m'enrhume pas, j'attrape les veaux de loin, sans écorcher mes engelures ? Dans ce coin-là, touchée, margot ! Et dans cet autre coin, touchée aussi ! Et dans cet autre, touchée encore ! Ah ! si tu te fourres sous le lit, je cogne avec le manche ? Hop ! hop ! à dada ! à dada !","- Hop! hey! he yelled, it's the race of donkeys! ? Eh ? very nice, in the morning, in winter; I sleep, I don't catch a cold, I catch calves from afar, without scratching my chilblains? In that corner, touched, margot! And in this other corner, touched too! And in this other, touched again! Ah! if you get under the bed, do I hit the handle? Hop! hey! to dada! to dada!","The lash curled round Lalie's slender body; she fell to the floor, but he lashed her again and compelled her to rise. ""This is a very good thing,"" he said coolly, ""and saves my getting chilled on cold mornings. Yes, I can reach you in that corner—and in that! Skip now! Skip!""","“Gee up, gee up!” yelled he. “It’s the donkey race! Eh, it’ll be fine of a cold morning in winter. I can lie snug without getting cold or hurting my chilblains and catch the calves from a distance. In that corner there, a hit, you hussy! And in that other corner, a hit again! And in that one, another hit. Ah! if you crawl under the bed I’ll whack you with the handle. Gee up, you jade! Gee up! Gee up!”"
"- A-t-on jamais vu ! bégayait-elle. Ça m'a pris juste à la porte. J'avais envie de remonter et de me déshabiller. J'aurais rudement bien fait ? Ah ! elle est jolie, la noce ! Je le disais, je voulais tout renvoyer à samedi prochain. Et il pleut parce qu'on ne m'a pas écoutée ! Tant mieux ! tant mieux ! que le ciel crève ! Coupeau essaya de la calmer. Mais elle l'envoya coucher. Ce ne serait pas lui qui payerait sa robe, si elle était perdue. Elle avait une robe de soie noire, dans laquelle elle étouffait ; le corsage, trop étroit, tirait sur les boutonnières, la coupait aux épaules ; et la jupe, taillée en fourreau, lui serrait si fort les cuisses, qu'elle devait marcher à tout petits pas. Pourtant, les dames de la société la regardaient, les lèvres pincées, l'air ému de sa toilette. Elle ne parut même pas voir Gervaise, assise à côté de maman Coupeau. Elle appela Lorilleux, lui demanda son mouchoir ; puis, dans un coin de la boutique, soigneusement, elle essuya une à une les gouttes de pluie roulées sur la soie.","- Have we ever seen! she stuttered. It took me right to the door. I wanted to go upstairs and undress. I would have done pretty well? Ah! she is pretty, the wedding! I was saying it, I wanted to postpone everything until next Saturday. And it's raining because no one listened to me! So much the better ! so much the better ! let the sky burst! Coupeau tried to calm her down. But she sent him to bed. He wouldn't pay for her dress if it was lost. She had on a black silk dress in which she was suffocating; the bodice, too tight, pulled on the buttonholes, cut her at the shoulders; and the sheath skirt hugged her thighs so tightly that she had to walk very slowly. However, the ladies of society looked at her, their lips pursed, their air moved by her toilette. She did not even seem to see Gervaise, seated next to Maman Coupeau. She called Lorilleux, asked him for his handkerchief; then, in a corner of the shop, she carefully wiped off one by one the drops of rain rolled on the silk.","""I had ten minds,"" she exclaimed, ""to turn back. I wanted you to wait until next Saturday. I knew it would rain today—I was certain of it!"" Coupeau tried to calm her, but she quickly snubbed him. Was it he, she would like to know, who was to pay for her dress if it were spoiled? She wore black silk, so tight that the buttonholes were burst out, and it showed white on the shoulders,—while the skirt was so scant that she could not take a long step. The other women, however, looked at her silk with envy. She took no notice of Gervaise, who sat by the side of her mother-in-law. She called to Lorilleux and with his aid carefully wiped every drop of rain from her dress with her handkerchief.","“Did any one ever see such a thing?” she exclaimed. “It caught me just at the door. I felt inclined to go upstairs again and take my things off. I should have been wise had I done so. Ah! it’s a pretty wedding! I said how it would be. I wanted to put it off till next Saturday; and it rains because they wouldn’t listen to me! So much the better, so much the better! I wish the sky would burst!” Coupeau tried to pacify her without success. He wouldn’t have to pay for her dress if it was spoilt! She had on a black silk dress in which she was nearly choking, the bodice, too tight fitting , was almost bursting the button-holes, and was cutting her across the shoulders; while the skirt only allowed her to take very short steps in walking. However, the ladies present were all staring at her, quite overcome by her costume. She appeared not to notice Gervaise, who was sitting beside mother Coupeau. She asked her husband for his handkerchief. Then she went into a corner and very carefully wiped off the raindrops that had fallen on her silk dress."
"- Asseyez-vous là, mon brave homme, dit la blanchisseuse. Vous voulez bien manger avec nous, n'est-ce pas ?","- Sit there, my good man, said the laundress. You want to eat well with us, don't you?","""Sit there,"" said the clearstarcher. ""You are willing to dine with us, are you not?""","“Seat yourself there, my good fellow,” said the laundress. “You won’t mind eating with us, will you?”"
"De ses bras trop courts, elle cherchait à rabattre le drap, toute pudique, prise de honte pour son père. Bijard, stupide, les yeux sur ce cadavre qu'il avait fait, roulait toujours la tête, du mouvement ralenti d'un animal qui a de l'embêtement.","With her arms that were too short, she tried to pull back the sheet, quite modest, filled with shame for her father. Bijard, stupid, his eyes on the corpse he had made, was still rolling his head with the slow movement of a bored animal.","She was ashamed, ashamed for her father.","With her little arms she tried to draw up the sheet again, ashamed as it were for her father. Bijard, as stultified as ever, with his eyes on the corpse which was his own work, still wagged his head, but more slowly, like a worried animal might do."
"Le zingueur, plaisantant, rigolant, décida la jeune femme, lorsqu'il lui eut juré qu'on ne s'amuserait pas. Il aurait l'œil sur les verres, pour empêcher les coups de soleil. Alors, il organisa un pique-nique à cent sous par tête, chez Auguste, au Moulin-d'Argent, boulevard de la Chapelle. C'était un petit marchand de vin dans les prix doux, qui avait un bastringue au fond de son arrière-boutique, sous les trois acacias de sa cour. Au premier, on serait parfaitement bien. Pendant dix jours, il racola des convives, dans la maison de sa sœur, rue de la Goutte-d'Or : M. Madinier, mademoiselle Remanjou, madame Gaudron et son mari. Il finit même par faire accepter à Gervaise deux camarades, Bibi-la-Grillade et Mes-Bottes ; sans doute Mes-Bottes levait le coude, mais il avait un appétit si farce, qu'on l'invitait toujours dans les pique-niques, à cause de la tête du marchand de soupe en voyant ce sacré trou-là avaler ses douze livres de pain. La jeune femme, de son côté, promit d'amener sa patronne, madame Fauconnier, et les Boche, de très braves gens. Tout compte fait, on se trouverait quinze à table, c'était assez. Quand on est trop de monde, ça se termine toujours par des disputes.","The zinc worker, joking, laughing, decided the young woman, when he had sworn to her that we would not have fun. He would have his eye on the glasses, to prevent sunburn. So he organized a picnic at a hundred sous a head, at Auguste's, at the Moulin-d'Argent, boulevard de la Chapelle. He was a small, low-priced wine merchant who had a bar in the back of his shop, under the three acacia trees in his yard. On the first, we would be perfectly fine. For ten days he solicited guests in his sister's house, rue de la Goutte-d'Or: M. Madinier, Mademoiselle Remanjou, Madame Gaudron and her husband. He even ended up getting Gervaise to accept two comrades, Bibi-la-Grillade and Mes-Bottes; No doubt My-Boots raised his elbow, but he had such a farcical appetite that he was always invited to picnics, because of the soup seller's face when he saw that damned hole swallow his twelve pounds. of bread. The young woman, for her part, promised to bring her boss, Madame Fauconnier, and the Boches, very good people. All in all, there would be fifteen of us at the table, that was enough. When there are too many people, it always ends in arguments.","He vowed that no one should drink too much and finally obtained the young woman's consent and organized a picnic at five francs per head at the Moulin d'Argent, Boulevard de la Chapelle. He was a small wine merchant who had a garden back of his restaurant. He made out a list. Among others appeared the names of two of his comrades, Bibi-la-Grillade and Mes-Bottes. It was true that Mes-Bottes crooked his elbow, but he was so deliciously funny that he was always invited to picnics. Gervaise said she, in her turn, would bring her employer, Mme Fauconnier—all told, there would be fifteen at the table. That was quite enough.","The zinc-worker, chaffing and joking, at length got the young woman to consent by promising her that there should be no larks. He would keep his eye on the glasses, to prevent sunstrokes. Then he organized a sort of picnic at five francs a head, at the “Silver Windmill,” kept by Auguste, on the Boulevard de la Chapelle. It was a small cafe with moderate charges and had a dancing place in the rear, beneath the three acacias in the courtyard. They would be very comfortable on the first floor. During the next ten days, he got hold of guests in the house where his sister lived in the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or— Monsieur Madinier, Mademoiselle Remanjou, Madame Gaudron and her husband. He even ended by getting Gervaise to consent to the presence of two of his comrades—Bibi-the-Smoker and My-Boots. No doubt My-Boots was a boozer; but then he had such a fantastic appetite that he was always asked to join those sort of gatherings, just for the sight of the caterer’s mug when he beheld that bottomless pit swallowing his twelve pounds of bread. The young woman on her side, promised to bring her employer Madame Fauconnier and the Boches, some very agreeable people. On counting, they found there would be fifteen to sit down to table, which was quite enough. When there are too many, they always wind up by quarrelling."
"Et il expliqua que la chambre au linge sale, nettoyée, ferait une jolie pièce. Etienne coucherait dans la boutique, sur un matelas jeté par terre, voilà tout.","And he explained that the room with the dirty linen, cleaned, would make a pretty room. Etienne would sleep in the shop, on a mattress thrown on the floor, that's all.","And he explained that the linen room could be so arranged that it would be very comfortable, and Etienne could sleep on a mattress in the corner.","And he explained that the dirty-clothes room, cleaned out, would make a nice apartment. Etienne could sleep in the shop, on a mattress on the floor, that was all."
"- Va, je te laisse, je trouverai bien un homme.","- Go, I leave you, I will find a man.","""Very well then; I will go and find some man who has a sou.""","“All right, I’ll leave you. I guess I can find a man.”"
"Cela fit rire. Mais la mauvaise humeur grandissait. Ça devenait crevant à la fin. Il fallait décider quelque chose. On ne comptait pas sans doute se regarder comme ça le blanc des yeux jusqu'au dîner. Alors, pendant un quart d'heure, en face de l'averse entêtée, on se creusa le cerveau. Bibi-la-Grillade proposait de jouer aux cartes ; Boche, de tempérament polisson et sournois, savait un petit jeu bien drôle, le jeu du confesseur ; madame Gaudron parlait d'aller manger de la tarte aux oignons, chaussée Clignancourt ; madame Lerat aurait souhaité qu'on racontât des histoires ; Gaudron ne s'embêtait pas, se trouvait bien là, offrait seulement de se mettre à table tout de suite. Et, à chaque proposition, on discutait, on se fâchait : c'était bête, ça endormirait tout le monde, on les prendrait pour des moutards. Puis, comme Lorilleux, voulant dire son mot, trouvait quelque chose de bien simple, une promenade sur les boulevards extérieurs jusqu'au Père-Lachaise, où l'on pourrait entrer voir le tombeau d'Héloïse et d'Abélard, si l'on avait le temps, madame Lorilleux, ne se contenant plus, éclata. Elle fichait le camp, elle ! Voilà ce qu'elle faisait ! Est-ce qu'on se moquait du monde ? Elle s'habillait, elle recevait la pluie, et c'était pour s'enfermer chez un marchand de vin ! Non, non, elle en avait assez d'une noce comme ça, elle préférait son chez elle. Coupeau et Lorilleux durent barrer la porte. Elle répétait :","It made her laugh. But the bad mood grew. It was getting boring by the end. Something had to be decided. No doubt we weren't counting on looking at each other like that with the whites of our eyes until dinner. So, for a quarter of an hour, in the face of the stubborn downpour, we racked our brains. Bibi-la-Grillade offered to play cards; Boche, of a naughty and sly temperament, knew a very funny little game, the game of the confessor; Madame Gaudron was talking about going to eat some onion tart, Chaussée Clignancourt; Madame Lerat would have liked stories to be told; Gaudron didn't bother, was there, only offered to sit down to eat right away. And, with each proposal, we discussed, we got angry: it was stupid, it would put everyone to sleep, we would take them for brats. Then, as Lorilleux, wanting to say his word, found something very simple, a walk on the outer boulevards to Père-Lachaise, where one could enter to see the tomb of Héloïse and Abélard, if the there was time, Madame Lorilleux, no longer containing herself, broke out. She was driving away, she! That's what she was doing! Were we making fun of the world? She got dressed, she received the rain, and it was to lock herself up in a wine merchant's! No, no, she was tired of a wedding like that, she preferred her home. Coupeau and Lorilleux had to bar the door. She repeated:","""Nice walking it would be! And how pleasant the grass would be to sit upon!"" Something must be done, however, to get rid of the time until dinner. Bibi-la-Grillade proposed cards; Mme Lerat suggested storytelling. To each proposition a thousand objections were offered. Finally when Lorilleux proposed that the party should visit the tomb of Abelard and Heloise his wife's indignation burst forth. She had dressed in her best only to be drenched in the rain and to spend the day in a wineshop, it seemed! She had had enough of the whole thing and she would go home. Coupeau and Lorilleux held the door, she exclaiming violently:","That made some of them laugh; but the general ill-humor increased. It was becoming ludicrous. They must decide on something unless they planned to sit there, staring at each other, until time for dinner. So for the next quarter of an hour, while the persistent rain continued, they tried to think of what to do. Bibi-the-Smoker suggested that they play cards. Boche slyly suggesting a most amusing game, the game of true confessions. Madame Gaudron thought of going to eat onion tarts on the Chaussee Clignancourt. Madame Lerat wanted to hear some stories. Gaudron said he wasn’t a bit put out and thought they were quite well off where they were, out of the downpour. He suggested sitting down to dinner immediately. There was a discussion after each proposal. Some said that this would put everybody to sleep or that that would make people think they were stupid. Lorilleux had to get his word in. He finally suggested a walk along the outer Boulevards to Pere Lachaise cemetery. They could visit the tomb of Heloise and Abelard. Madame Lorilleux exploded, no longer able to control herself. She was leaving, she was. Were they trying to make fun of her? She got all dressed up and came out in the rain. And for what? To be wasting time in a wineshop. No, she had had enough of this wedding party. She’d rather be in her own home. Coupeau and Lorilleux had to get between her and the door to keep her from leaving. She kept telling them, “Get out of my way!"
"Lantier ne prit pas tout de suite la pièce de cent sous. Il aurait voulu qu'elle fit de la monnaie, pour lui laisser quelque chose. Mais il se décida à la glisser dans la poche de son gilet, quand il vit, sur la commode, un reste de jambon dans un papier, avec un bout de pain.","Lantier did not immediately take the five-franc piece. He would have liked her to make some change, to leave him something. But he decided to slip it into his waistcoat pocket when he saw, on the chest of drawers, a piece of ham left in a piece of paper, with a piece of bread.","Lantier did not at once take up the money. He had sent her to the Mont-de-Piété that he might not leave her without food or money, but when he caught sight of part of a ham wrapped in paper on the table with half a loaf of bread he slipped the silver piece into his vest pocket.","Lantier did not pick up the five franc piece directly. He would rather that she got change, so as to leave her some of it. But he decided to slip it into his waistcoat pocket, when he noticed a small piece of ham wrapped up in paper, and the remains of a loaf on the chest of drawers."
"- On y est, malin !","- Here we are, smart!","he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","“Right you are, my boy!”"
"- Si madame voulait accepter mes genoux, ça serait plus tendre, dit galamment Mes-Bottes.","- If madame wanted to accept my knees, it would be more tender, said My-Boots gallantly.","Gervaise saw she could not stand there among all those men, so she accepted the offered chair.","“If madame would accept my knees she would find them softer than the seat,” gallantly said My-Boots."
"Et Bibi-la-Grillade accepta une prune. Il devait être là, sur le banc, à attendre une tournée. Cependant, Lantier défendait les patrons ; ils avaient parfois joliment du mal, il en savait quelque chose, lui qui sortait des affaires. De la jolie fripouille, les ouvriers ! toujours en noce, se fichant de l'ouvrage, vous lâchant au beau milieu d'une commande, reparaissant quand leur monnaie est nettoyée. Ainsi, il avait eu un petit Picard, dont la toquade était de se trimbaler en voiture ; oui, dès qu'il touchait sa semaine, il prenait des fiacres pendant des journées. Est-ce que c'était là un goût de travailleur ? Puis, brusquement, Lantier se mit à attaquer aussi les patrons. Oh ! il voyait clair, il disait ses vérités à chacun. Une sale race après tout, des exploiteurs sans vergogne, des mangeurs de monde. Lui, Dieu merci ! pouvait dormir la conscience tranquille, car il s'était toujours conduit en ami avec ses hommes, et avait préféré ne pas gagner des millions comme les autres.","And Bibi-la-Grillade accepted a plum. He must have been there, on the bench, waiting for a round. However, Lantier defended the bosses; they sometimes had a pretty hard time, he knew something about that, he who was going out of business. Pretty scoundrels, the workers! always in a wedding, not caring about the work, leaving you in the middle of an order, reappearing when their change is cleaned. Thus, he had had a little Picard, whose infatuation was to carry around in the car; yes, as soon as he reached his week, he took cabs for days. Was that a worker's taste? Then, suddenly, Lantier began to attack the bosses as well. Oh ! he saw clearly, he spoke his truths to everyone. A filthy race after all, shameless exploiters, world eaters. Him, thank God! could sleep with a clear conscience, for he had always behaved as friends with his men, and had preferred not to earn millions like the others.","And Bibi accepted a glass of liquor. Lantier defended the masters. They were not so bad after all; then, too, how were the men to get along without them? "" To be sure,"" continued Lantier, ""I manage pretty well, for I don't have much to do with them myself!""","Bibi-the-Smoker accepted a plum. He was, no doubt, waiting there on that bench for someone to stand him a drink. Lantier, however, took the part of the employers; they often had some very hard times, as he who had been in business himself well knew. The workers were a bad lot, forever getting drunk! They didn’t take their work seriously. Sometimes they quit in the middle of a job and only returned when they needed something in their pockets. Then Lantier would switch his attack to the employers. They were nasty exploiters, regular cannibals. But he could sleep with a clear conscience as he had always acted as a friend to his employees. He didn’t want to get rich the way others did."
"Et tous les deux, le chapelier et l'épicière, se carraient davantage, comme sur un trône, tandis que Gervaise se traînait à leurs pieds, dans la boue noire. Virginie devait jouir, car ses yeux de chat s'éclairèrent un instant d'étincelles jaunes, et elle regarda Lantier avec un sourire mince. Enfin, ça la vengeait donc de l'ancienne fessée du lavoir, qu'elle avait toujours gardée sur la conscience !","And both of them, the hatter and the grocer, sat more squarely, as if on a throne, while Gervaise dragged herself at their feet in the black mud. Virginie must have enjoyed, for her cat's eyes lit up for a moment with yellow sparks, and she looked at Lantier with a thin smile. Finally, it avenged her for the old washhouse spanking, which she had always kept on her conscience!","And then Lantier and Virginie fell into a conversation, while Gervaise crawled along the floor in the dirt at their feet. Mme Poisson enjoyed this, for her cat's eyes sparkled with malicious joy, and she glanced at Lantier with a smile. At last she was avenged for that mortification at the lavatory, which had for years weighed heavy on her soul.","And both together, the hatter and the groceress assumed a more important air, as if they had been on a throne whilst Gervaise dragged herself through the black mud at their feet. Virginie must have enjoyed herself, for a yellowish flame darted from her cat’s eyes, and she looked at Lantier with an insidious smile. At last she was revenged for that hiding she had received at the wash-house, and which she had never forgotten."
"- Tiens ! la mariée ! cria l'un des voyous, en montrant madame Gaudron. Ah ! malheur ! elle a avalé un rude pépin !","- Take ! the bride ! shouted one of the thugs, pointing to Madame Gaudron. Ah! misfortune ! she swallowed a big glitch!","The wedding procession, quite undisturbed by the observation it excited, went gaily on.","“Look! Here comes the bride!” one of the urchins shouted, pointing to Madame Gaudron. “Oh! Isn’t it too bad! She must have swallowed something!”"
Qué cochon d'enfant !,What a childish pig!,"His song was one familiar to them all and even to the street, for the little crowd at the door joined in the chorus.",What a piggish child!”
"- Oui, c'est ce que je vois, reprit-elle, et j'en suis fâchée pour vous, monsieur Coupeau ? Il ne faut pas que ça vous blesse. Si j'avais des idées à rire, mon Dieu ! ça serait encore plutôt avec vous qu'avec un autre. Vous avez l'air bon garçon, vous êtes gentil. On se mettrait ensemble, n'est-ce pas ? et on irait tant qu'on irait. Je ne fais pas ma princesse, je ne dis point que ça n'aurait pas pu arriver ? Seulement, à quoi bon, puisque je n'en ai pas envie ? Me voilà chez madame Fauconnier depuis quinze jours. Les petits vont à l'école. Je travaille, je suis contente ? Hein, le mieux alors est de rester comme on est.","- Yes, that's what I see, she went on, and I'm sorry for you, Monsieur Coupeau? It doesn't have to hurt you. If only I had ideas to laugh about, my God! it would still be rather with you than with another. You look good boy, you are nice. We would get together, wouldn't we? and we would go as long as we would go. I'm not playing my princess, I'm not saying it couldn't have happened? Only, what's the point, since I don't want to? I have been at Madame Fauconnier's for a fortnight. The children go to school. I work, am I happy? Hey, the best then is to stay as we are.","Yes, hurting my feelings."" ""Yes, I see that,"" she answered, ""and I am really very sorry for you. If I had any idea of leading a different life from that which I follow today it might as well be with you as with another. You have the look of a good-natured man. But what is the use? I have now been with Madame Fauconnier for a fortnight. The children are going to school, and I am very happy, for I have plenty to do. Don't you see, therefore, that it is best for us to remain as we are?""","“Yes, I know that,” resumed she, “and I am sorry, Monsieur Coupeau. But you mustn’t take it to heart. If I had any idea of enjoying myself, mon Dieu! , I would certainly rather be with you than anyone else. You’re a good boy and gentle. Only, where’s the use, as I’ve no inclination to wed? I’ve been for the last fortnight, now, at Madame Fauconnier’s. The children go to school. I’ve work, I’m contented. So the best is to remain as we are, isn’t it?”"
"- Mais non, mais non, répétait-il sans trouver autre chose.","- But no, but no, he repeated without finding anything else.","He dared not kiss her, and she was compelled to offer her cheek to him, and both were embarrassed. He told her in a confused way that his mother was ill with sciatica and could not come.","“Not at all, not at all!” repeated he, unable to say anything else."
"Clémence prenait un fer à la mécanique, avec sa poignée de cuir garnie de tôle, et l'approchait de sa joue, pour s'assurer s'il était assez chaud. Elle le frotta sur son carreau, l'essuya sur un linge pendu à sa ceinture, et attaqua sa trente-cinquième chemise, en repassant d'abord l'empiècement et les deux manches.","Clemence took a mechanical iron, with its leather handle lined with sheet metal, and held it to her cheek to make sure it was hot enough. She rubbed it on her tile, wiped it on a cloth hanging from her belt, and started on her thirty-fifth shirt, ironing first the yoke and the two sleeves.","Mme Putois had attacked the basket of linen prepared by Gervaise, and Augustine was ironing her towels, with her nose in the air, deeply interested in a fly that was buzzing about.","Clemence took an iron from the stove with her leather holder in which a piece of sheet iron was inserted, and held it up to her cheek to see how hot it was. She rubbed it on her brick, wiped it on a piece of rag hanging from her waist-band and started on her thirty-fifth shirt, first of all ironing the shoulders and the sleeves."
"Les rires recommencèrent. Gervaise, à voix presque basse, se contentait toujours de murmurer :","The laughter started again. Gervaise, in an almost low voice, still contented herself with murmuring:",", I am sure, to anyone who will carry him back!"" The women all laughed. Gervaise, in a low, concentrated voice, repeated:",The laughter burst forth again. Gervaise contented herself with continually murmuring in a low tone of voice:
"Il se haussait, riant d'un rire de poulie mal graissée. Clémence, appuyée fortement sur l'établi, les poignets retournés, les coudes en l'air et écartés, pliait le cou, dans un effort ; et toute sa chair nue avait un gonflement, ses épaules remontaient avec le jeu lent des muscles mettant des battements sous la peau fine, la gorge s'enflait, moite de sueur, dans l'ombre rose de la chemise béante. Alors, il envoya les mains, il voulut toucher.","He would raise himself, laughing the laughter of a badly greased pulley. Clemence, leaning strongly on the workbench, her wrists turned back, her elbows in the air and apart, bent her neck in an effort; and all his bare flesh swelled, his shoulders rose with the slow play of muscles throbbing under the thin skin, his throat swelled, clammy with sweat, in the pink shadow of the gaping shirt. So he sent his hands, he wanted to touch.",Gervaise undressed her husband and tucked him up in bed as if he had been a child and then returned to her fluting irons in time to still a grand dispute that was going on about an iron that had not been properly cleaned.,"He raised himself up with a shrill laugh that resembled a pulley in want of grease. Clemence, leaning heavily over the ironing-table, her wrists bent in, her elbows sticking out and wide apart was bending her neck in a last effort; and all her muscles swelled, her shoulders rose with the slow play of the muscles beating beneath the soft skin, her breasts heaved, wet with perspiration in the rosy shadow of the half open chemise. Then Coupeau thrust out his hands, trying to touch her bare flesh."
"Madame Boche, cependant, interrogeait l'enfant à son tour, tout allumée de se trouver dans cette histoire.","Madame Boche, however, questioned the child in her turn, all fired up at finding herself in this story.","Mme Boche, in her turn, interrogated the child eagerly, for she was charmed at finding herself an actor, as it were, in this drama.","Madame Boche, however, also questioned the child, quite delighted at the chance of hearing the whole story."
"- Personne, dit Virginie ; des gens que vous ne connaissez pas.","- No one, said Virginie; people you don't know.","""No one,"" said Virginie, ""or at least no one whom you know.""","“Nobody you know,” said Virginie."
"- Pardi ! murmura Augustine, dont la tête roulait sur les épaules, ils sont paf ; ils ont chanté comme les grandes personnes.","- Goodbye! murmured Augustine, her head rolling on her shoulders, they're crap; they sang like grown-ups.",Gervaise started as her eyes fell on her boy.,"“No wonder!” murmured Augustine, whose head was rolling about on her shoulders, “they’re drunk; they’ve been singing like grown up persons.”"
"- Ne parlons pas tous à la fois, dit Boche, comme chacun se taisait, le nez sur son assiette.","""Let's not all talk at once,"" said Boche, as everyone was silent, his nose on his plate.","""Don't let us all talk at once!"" said Boche as a dead silence fell on the room, broken by the abrupt entrance of Mes-Bottes.","“Don’t all talk at once,” said Boche, as everyone remained silent with his nose in his plate."
"Oui, le pis était que, dans ses terreurs, Gervaise se trouvait attirée jusqu'à coller son oreille contre le mur, pour mieux se rendre compte. Bazouge lui faisait l'effet que les beaux hommes font aux femmes honnêtes : elles voudraient les tâter, mais elles n'osent pas ; la bonne éducation les retient. Eh bien ! si la peur ne l'avait pas retenue, Gervaise aurait voulu tâter la mort, voir comment c'était bâti. Elle devenait si drôle par moments, l'haleine suspendue, attentive, attendant le mot du secret dans un mouvement de Bazouge, que Coupeau lui demandait en ricanant si elle avait un béguin pour le croque-mort d'à côté. Elle se fâchait, parlait de déménager, tant ce voisinage la répugnait ; et, malgré elle, dès que le vieux arrivait avec son odeur de cimetière, elle retombait à ses réflexions, et prenait l'air allumé et craintif d'une épouse qui rêve de donner des coups de canif dans le contrat. Ne lui avait-il pas offert deux fois de l'emballer, de l'emmener avec lui quelque part, sur un dodo où la jouissance du sommeil est si forte, qu'on oublie du coup toutes les misères ? Peut-être était-ce en effet bien bon. Peu à peu, une tentation plus cuisante lui venait d'y goûter. Elle aurait voulu essayer pour quinze jours, un mois. Oh ! dormir un mois, surtout en hiver, le mois du terme, quand les embêtements de la vie la crevaient ! Mais ce n'était pas possible, il fallait continuer de dormir toujours, si l'on commençait à dormir une heure ; et cette pensée la glaçait, son béguin de la mort s'en allait, devant l'éternelle et sévère amitié que demandait la terre.","Yes, the worst was that, in her terrors, Gervaise found herself drawn so far as to press her ear against the wall, the better to realize. Bazouge had on him the effect that handsome men have on honest women: they would like to feel them, but they don't dare; good education retains them. Well ! if fear hadn't held her back, Gervaise would have liked to feel death, to see how it was built. She became so funny at times, her breath suspended, attentive, waiting for the word of the secret in a movement of Bazouge, that Coupeau asked her with a sneer if she had a crush on the undertaker next door. She got angry, talked about moving, so repugnant was this neighborhood; and, in spite of herself, as soon as the old man arrived with his graveyard smell, she relapsed into her thoughts, and assumed the excited and fearful air of a wife who dreams of stabbing the contract with a penknife. Hadn't he twice offered to wrap her up, to take her with him somewhere, on a dodo where the enjoyment of sleep is so strong that one suddenly forgets all the miseries? Maybe it was indeed good. Little by little, a more burning temptation came to him to taste it. She would have liked to try for a fortnight, a month. Oh ! to sleep for a month, especially in winter, the month of her term, when she was tormented by the hassles of life! But that was not possible, you had to go on sleeping forever, if you started sleeping for an hour; and this thought froze her, her crush of death was going away, before the eternal and severe friendship which the earth demanded.","She talked of moving but at the same time was reluctant to do so, for there was a strange fascination about Bazonge after all. Had he not told her once that he would come for her and lay her down to sleep in the shadow of waving branches, where she would know neither hunger nor toil? She wished she could try it for a month. And she thought how delicious it would be in midwinter, just at the time her quarter's rent was due. But, alas, this was not possible! The rest and the sleep must be eternal; this thought chilled her, and her longing for death faded away before the unrelenting severity of the bonds exacted by Mother Earth.","The worst was that, in spite of her terrors, something incited Gervaise to put her ear to the wall, the better to find out what was taking place. Bazouge had the same effect on her as handsome men have on good women: they would like to touch them. Well! if fear had not kept her back, Gervaise would have liked to have handled death, to see what it was like. She became so peculiar at times, holding her breath, listening attentively, expecting to unravel the secret through one of Bazouge’s movements, that Coupeau would ask her with a chuckle if she had a fancy for that gravedigger next door. She got angry and talked of moving, the close proximity of this neighbor was so distasteful to her; and yet, in spite of herself, as soon as the old chap arrived, smelling like a cemetery, she became wrapped again in her reflections, with the excited and timorous air of a wife thinking of passing a knife through the marriage contract. Had he not twice offered to pack her up and carry her off with him to some place where the enjoyment of sleep is so great, that in a moment one forgets all one’s wretchedness? Perhaps it was really very pleasant. Little by little the temptation to taste it became stronger. She would have liked to have tried it for a fortnight or a month. Oh! to sleep a month, especially in winter, the month when the rent became due, when the troubles of life were killing her! But it was not possible—one must sleep forever, if one commences to sleep for an hour; and the thought of this froze her, her desire for death departed before the eternal and stern friendship which the earth demanded."
"Tranquillement allongé, les yeux levés au-dessus de lui, sur le lambeau de perse déteinte, Lantier n'écoutait plus, s'enfonçait dans une idée fixe. Il resta ainsi près d'une heure, sans céder au sommeil, malgré la fatigue qui appesantissait ses paupières. Quand il se retourna, s'appuyant sur le coude, la face dure et déterminée, Gervaise achevait de ranger la chambre. Elle faisait le lit des enfants, qu'elle venait de lever et d'habiller. Il la regarda donner un coup de balai, essuyer les meubles ; la pièce restait noire, lamentable, avec son plafond fumeux, son papier décollé par l'humidité, ses trois chaises et sa commode éclopées, où la crasse s'entêtait et s'étalait sous le torchon. Puis, pendant qu'elle se lavait à grande eau, après avoir rattaché ses cheveux, devant le petit miroir rond, pendu à l'espagnolette, qui lui servait pour se raser, il parut examiner ses bras nus, son cou nu, tout le nu qu'elle montrait, comme si des comparaisons s'établissaient dans son esprit. Et il eut une moue des lèvres. Gervaise boitait de la jambe droite ; mais on ne s'en apercevait guère que les jours de fatigue, quand elle s'abandonnait, les hanches brisées. Ce matin-là, rompue par sa nuit, elle traînait sa jambe, elle s'appuyait aux murs.","Lying quietly, his eyes raised above him, on the shred of faded Persian, Lantier was no longer listening, sinking into a fixed idea. He remained thus for almost an hour, without giving in to sleep, in spite of the fatigue which weighed down his eyelids. When he turned around, leaning on his elbow, his face hard and determined, Gervaise was finishing tidying up the room. She was making the bed for the children, whom she had just picked up and dressed. He watched her sweep the broom, wipe the furniture; the room remained dark, lamentable, with its smoky ceiling, its paper unglued by the damp, its three chairs and its battered chest of drawers, where the grime persisted and spread under the cloth. Then, while she was washing herself with plenty of water, after having tied up her hair, before the little round mirror, hanging from the latch, which she used for shaving, he seemed to examine her bare arms, her bare neck, the whole bare she was showing, as if comparisons were forming in her mind. And he pouted his lips. Gervaise limped in her right leg; but you hardly noticed it except on days of fatigue, when she let herself go, her hips broken. That morning, broken by her night, she dragged her leg, she leaned against the walls.","Lantier was lying flat on his back with his eyes fixed on the ceiling. He was not listening; his attention was concentrated on some fixed idea. He remained in this way for an hour and more, not sleeping, in spite of his evident and intense fatigue. When he turned and, leaning on his elbow, looked about the room again, he found that Gervaise had arranged the chamber and made the children's bed. They were washed and dressed. He watched her as she swept the room and dusted the furniture. The room was very dreary still, however, with its smoke-stained ceiling and paper discolored by dampness and three chairs and dilapidated bureau, whose greasy surface no dusting could clean. Then while she washed herself and arranged her hair before the small mirror, he seemed to examine her arms and shoulders, as if instituting a comparison between herself and someone else. And he smiled a disdainful little smile. Gervaise was slightly, very slightly, lame, but her lameness was perceptible, only on such days as she was very tired. This morning, so weary was she from the watches of the night, that she could hardly walk without support.","Stretched out quietly, his eyes raised to the faded strip of chintz, Lantier no longer listened, but seemed to be buried in a fixed idea. He remained thus for nearly an hour, without giving way to sleep, in spite of the fatigue which weighed his eyelids down. He finally turned toward Gervaise, his face set hard in determination. She had gotten the children up and dressed and had almost finished cleaning the room. The room looked, as always, dark and depressing with its sooty black ceiling and paper peeling from the damp walls. The dilapidated furniture was always streaked and dirty despite frequent dustings. Gervaise, devouring her grief, trying to assume a look of indifference, hurried over her work. Lantier watched as she tidied her hair in front of the small mirror hanging near the window. While she washed herself he looked at her bare arms and shoulders. He seemed to be making comparisons in his mind as his lips formed a grimace. Gervaise limped with her right leg, though it was scarcely noticeable except when she was tired. To-day, exhausted from remaining awake all night, she was supporting herself against the wall and dragging her leg."
"- Voilà la maison ? Moi, je suis né plus loin, au 22 ? Mais cette maison-là, tout de même, fait un joli tas de maçonnerie ! C'est grand comme une caserne, là-dedans !","- This is the house? Me, I was born further away, at 22? But that house, all the same, is a pretty pile of masonry! It's as big as a barracks in there!","He stopped and looked up. ""There is the house,"" he said, ""and I was born only a few doors farther off. It is an enormous place.""","“That’s the house. I was born farther on, at No. 22. But this house is, all the same, a fine block of masonry! It’s as big as a barrack inside!”"
"Dans cette bosse de rires, Nana rigolait, il fallait voir ! Aucun mot à double entente ne lui échappait. Elle en lâchait elle-même de raides, en les appuyant du menton, rengorgée et crevant d'aise. Elle était dans le vice comme un poisson dans l'eau. Et elle roulait très bien ses queues de violettes, tout en se tortillant sur sa chaise. Oh ! un chic épatant, pas même le temps de rouler une cigarette. Rien que le geste de prendre une mince bande de papier vert, et, allez-y ! le papier filait et enveloppait le laiton ; puis, une goutte de gomme en haut pour coller, c'était fait, c'était un brin de verdure frais et délicat, bon à mettre sur les appas des dames. Le chic était dans les doigts, dans ses doigts minces de gourgandine, qui semblaient désossés, souples et câlins. Elle n'avait pu apprendre que ça du métier. On lui donnait à faire toutes les queues de l'atelier, tant elle les faisait bien.","In this bump of laughter, Nana was laughing, you had to see! Not a single double-minded word escaped him. She dropped stiff ones herself, leaning on them with her chin, stuffed and bursting with pleasure. She was in vice like a fish in water. And she rolled her tails of violets very well, while squirming in her chair. Oh ! stunning chic, not even time to roll a cigarette. Just the gesture of taking a thin strip of green paper, and, go for it! the paper spun and enveloped the brass; then, a drop of gum at the top to stick, it was done, it was a fresh and delicate sprig of greenery, good to put on the charms of the ladies. The chic was in the fingers, in her slender slender fingers, which seemed boned, supple and cuddly. She had only been able to learn that from the trade. She was given all the queues in the workshop to do, she did them so well.","Nana listened to the conversation which followed—reveling in indecency—as much at home in it as a fish is in water. All the time her fingers were busy at work. She wound her violet stems and fastened in the leaves with a slender strip of green paper. A drop of gum—and then behold a bunch of delicate fresh verdure which would fascinate any lady. Her fingers were especially deft by nature. No instruction could have imparted this quality. The gentleman had gone away, and the workshop settled down into quiet once more.","They refused to listen to any explanation, but maintained they were going to call in the gentleman outside to rekindle Madame Lerat’s fire."
"Gervaise avait attendu Lantier jusqu'à deux heures du matin. Puis, toute frissonnante d'être restée en camisole à l'air vif de la fenêtre, elle s'était assoupie, jetée en travers du lit, fiévreuse, les joues trempées de larmes. Depuis huit jours, au sortir du Veau à deux têtes, où ils mangeaient, il l'envoyait se coucher avec les enfants et ne reparaissait que tard dans la nuit, en racontant qu'il cherchait du travail. Ce soir-là, pendant qu'elle guettait son retour, elle croyait l'avoir vu entrer au bal du Grand-Balcon, dont les dix fenêtres flambantes éclairaient d'une nappe d'incendie la coulée noire des boulevards extérieurs ; et, derrière lui, elle avait aperçu la petite Adèle, une brunisseuse qui dînait à leur restaurant, marchant à cinq ou six pas, les mains ballantes, comme si elle venait de lui quitter le bras pour ne pas passer ensemble sous la clarté crue des globes de la porte.","Gervaise had waited for Lantier until two o'clock in the morning. Then, shivering from having remained in her camisole in the crisp air of the window, she had dozed off, thrown across the bed, feverish, her cheeks wet with tears. For eight days, on leaving the Two-Headed Calf, where they ate, he had sent her to bed with the children and only reappeared late at night, saying that he was looking for work. That evening, while she was waiting for him to return, she thought she had seen him enter the ballroom on the Grand-Balcony, whose ten blazing windows lit up with a sheet of fire the dark expanse of the outer boulevards; and, behind him, she had seen little Adèle, a burnisher who was dining at their restaurant, walking five or six paces, her hands dangling, as if she had just left his arm so as not to pass together under the harsh light of the trees. door globes.","GERVAISE Gervaise had waited and watched for Lantier until two in the morning. Then chilled and shivering, she turned from the window and threw herself across the bed, where she fell into a feverish doze with her cheeks wet with tears. For the last week when they came out of the Veau à Deux Têtes, where they ate, he had sent her off to bed with the children and had not appeared until late into the night and always with a story that he had been looking for work. This very night, while she was watching for his return, she fancied she saw him enter the ballroom of the Grand-Balcon, whose ten windows blazing with lights illuminated, as with a sheet of fire, the black lines of the outer boulevards. She caught a glimpse of Adèle, a pretty brunette who dined at their restaurant and who was walking a few steps behind him, with her hands swinging as if she had just dropped his arm, rather than pass before the bright light of the globes over the door in his company.","Gervaise had waited up for Lantier until two in the morning. Then, shivering from having remained in a thin loose jacket, exposed to the fresh air at the window, she had thrown herself across the bed, drowsy, feverish, and her cheeks bathed in tears. For a week past, on leaving the “Two-Headed Calf,” where they took their meals, he had sent her home with the children and never reappeared himself till late at night, alleging that he had been in search of work. That evening, while watching for his return, she thought she had seen him enter the dancing-hall of the “Grand-Balcony,” the ten blazing windows of which lighted up with the glare of a conflagration the dark expanse of the exterior Boulevards; and five or six paces behind him, she had caught sight of little Adele, a burnisher, who dined at the same restaurant, swinging her hands, as if she had just quitted his arm so as not to pass together under the dazzling light of the globes at the door."
"Alors, elle dit doucement :",So she said softly:,Then she answered faintly:,"Then she softly said, “I can’t—do you understand?"
"Enfin, au bas de la rue, ils découvrirent Coupeau et Poisson dans l'Assommoir du père Colombe. Ils se tenaient debout, au milieu d'un tas d'hommes ; Coupeau, en blouse grise, criait, avec des gestes furieux et des coups de poing sur le comptoir ; Poisson, qui n'était pas de service ce jour-là, serré dans un vieux paletot marron, l'écoutait, la mine terne et silencieuse, hérissant son impériale et ses moustaches rouges. Goujet laissa les femmes au bord du trottoir, vint poser la main sur l'épaule du zingueur. Mais quand ce dernier aperçut Gervaise et Virginie dehors, il se fâcha. Qui est-ce qui lui avait fichu des femelles de cette espèce ? Voilà que les jupons le relançaient maintenant ! Eh bien ! il ne bougerait pas, elles pouvaient manger leur saloperie de dîner toutes seules. Pour l'apaiser, il fallut que Goujet acceptât une tournée de quelque chose ; encore mit-il de la méchanceté à traîner cinq grandes minutes devant le comptoir. Lorsqu'il sortit enfin, il dit à sa femme :","Finally, at the bottom of the street, they discovered Coupeau and Poisson in Father Colombe's Assommoir. They were standing, in the middle of a heap of men; Coupeau, in a gray smock, shouted, with furious gestures and banging his fists on the counter; Poisson, who was off duty that day, squeezed into an old brown overcoat, listened to him, looking dull and silent, bristling his imperial coat and his red mustache. Goujet left the women at the edge of the sidewalk and put his hand on the shoulder of the zinc worker. But when the latter saw Gervaise and Virginie outside, he got angry. Who had given him females of this species? Now the petticoats revived him! Well ! he wouldn't move, they could eat their bloody dinner on their own. To appease him, Goujet had to accept a round of something; still he was spiteful in lingering for five long minutes in front of the counter. When he finally left, he said to his wife:","Finally at the Assommoir they found Coupeau and Poisson. They were standing in the center of an excited crowd. Coupeau, in a gray blouse, was quarreling with someone, and Poisson, who was not on duty that day, was listening quietly, his red mustache and imperial giving him, however, quite a formidable aspect. Goujet left the women outside and, going in, placed his hand on Coupeau's shoulder, who, when he saw his wife and Virginie, fell into a great rage. No, he would not move! He would not stand being followed about by women in this way! They might go home and eat their rubbishy dinner themselves! He did not want any of it! To appease him Goujet was compelled to drink with him, and finally he persuaded him to go with him. But when he was outside he said to Gervaise:","At length they discovered Coupeau and Poisson at the bottom of the street inside Pere Colombe’s l’Assommoir. They were standing up in the midst of a number of men; Coupeau, in a grey blouse, was shouting with furious gestures and banging his fists down on the counter. Poisson, not on duty that day and buttoned up in an old brown coat, was listening to him in a dull sort of way and without uttering a word, bristling his carroty moustaches and beard the while. Goujet left the women on the edge of the pavement, and went and laid his hand on the zinc-worker’s shoulder. But when the latter caught sight of Gervaise and Virginie outside he grew angry. Why was he badgered with such females as those? Petticoats had taken to tracking him about now! Well! He declined to stir, they could go and eat their beastly dinner all by themselves. To quiet him Goujet was obliged to accept a drop of something; and even then Coupeau took a fiendish delight in dawdling a good five minutes at the counter. When he at length came out he said to his wife:"
"- Qui ça ? cria-t-il. Ah ! oui, Nana ! ? Mais non, rien autre chose. La gueuse a une bouche ! un petit pot de fraises !","- Who is that ? he shouted. Ah! yes, Nana! ? But no, nothing else. The pig has a mouth! a little jar of strawberries!","""She?"" Lantier exclaimed. ""Who is she? Ah yes, I remember. Nana! No, she said nothing more."" And Gervaise went away with her thirty sous in her hand, her skirts dripping and her shoes leaving the mark of their broad soles on the sidewalk.","“Who?” he cried. “Ah, yes; you mean Nana. No, nothing else. What a tempting mouth she has, the little hussy! Real strawberry jam!”"
"Gervaise pourtant venait de commencer un bonnet appartenant à madame Boche, qu'elle voulait soigner. Elle avait préparé de l'amidon cuit pour le remettre à neuf. Elle promenait doucement, dans le fond de la coiffe, le polonais, un petit fer arrondi des deux bouts, lorsqu'une femme entra, osseuse, la face tachée de plaques rouges, les jupes trempées. C'était une maîtresse laveuse qui employait trois ouvrières au lavoir de la Goutte-d'Or.","Gervaise, however, had just started on a bonnet belonging to Madame Boche, which she wanted to take care of. She had prepared some cooked starch to make it look new again. She was gently moving the polish, a small iron rounded at both ends, in the back of the coif, when a woman entered, bony, her face stained with red patches, her skirts soaked. She was a mistress washerwoman who employed three workers at the Goutte-d'Or wash-house.","Gervaise had a cap belonging to Mme Boche in her hand and was ironing the crown with a round ball, when a tall, bony woman came in. She was a laundress.","Gervaise, during this incident, had commenced a cap belonging to Madame Boche, which she intended to take great pains with. She had prepared some boiled starch to make it look new again. She was gently passing a little iron rounded at both ends over the inside of the crown of the cap, when a bony-looking woman entered the shop, her face covered with red blotches and her skirts sopping wet. It was a washerwoman who employed three assistants at the wash-house in the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or."
- Allez-y ! cria Coupeau. Voilà les Anges qui pleurent.,- Go for it ! cried Coupeau. Here are the Angels crying.,"And it was in the first shower that Mme Lorilleux arrived, out of temper and out of breath, struggling with her umbrella, which she could not close.",“Here it goes!” cried Coupeau. “It’s the angels who’re weeping.”
"Lantier, d'un hochement de tête, approuva cet arrangement. On doit travailler, ça ne fait pas un doute ; seulement, quand on se trouve avec des amis, la politesse passe avant tout. Un désir de godaille les avait peu à peu chatouillés et engourdis tous les quatre, les mains lourdes, se tâtant du regard. Et, dès qu'ils eurent cinq heures de flâne devant eux, ils furent pris brusquement d'une joie bruyante, ils s'allongèrent des claques, se gueulèrent des mots de tendresse dans la figure, Coupeau surtout, soulagé, rajeuni, qui appelait les autres « ma vieille branche ! » On se mouilla encore d'une tournée générale ; puis, on alla à La Puce qui renifle, un petit bousingot où il y avait un billard. Le chapelier fit un instant son nez, parce que c'était une maison pas très propre : le schnick y valait un franc le litre, dix sous une chopine en deux verres, et la société de l'endroit avait commis tant de saletés sur le billard, que les billes y restaient collées. Mais, la partie une fois engagée, Lantier qui avait un coup de queue extraordinaire, retrouva sa grâce et sa belle humeur, développant son torse, accompagnant d'un effet de hanches chaque carambolage.","Lantier, with a shake of the head, approved of this arrangement. We have to work, there's no doubt about it; only, when one is with friends, politeness comes first. A desire for cuddling had tickled and numbed them all four little by little, heavy hands, feeling each other's eyes. And, as soon as they had five hours of strolling ahead of them, they were suddenly seized with a noisy joy, they stretched out with slaps, yelled words of tenderness in their faces, Coupeau above all, relieved, rejuvenated, who called the others ""my old branch!"" We wet ourselves again with a general tour; then we went to La Puce qui rerifle, a little bousingot where there was a billiard table. The hatter scowled for a moment, because it was a not very clean house: the schnick there was worth a franc a liter, ten sous a pint in two glasses, and the society of the place had committed so much dirt on the billiards, that the balls stuck to it. But, the game once started, Lantier, who had an extraordinary tail swipe, regained his grace and his good humor, developing his torso, accompanying each pile-up with an effect of hips.","Lantier assented to this arrangement. Of course work was a good thing, but friends and good company were better; and the four men stood, first on one foot and then on the other, for more than an hour, and then they had another drink all round. After that a game of billiards was proposed, and they went noisily down the street to the nearest billiard room, which did not happen to please the fastidious Lantier, who, however, soon recovered his good humor under the effect of the admiration excited in the minds of his friends by his play, which was really very extraordinary.","Lantier gave his blessing to this arrangement with an approving nod. Labor was necessary, yes, but when you’re with good friends, courtesy comes first. Now the four had five hours of idleness before them. They were full of noisy merriment. Coupeau was especially relieved. They had another round and then went to a small bar that had a billiard table. At first Lantier turned up his nose at this establishment because it was rather shabby. So much liquor had been spilled on the billiard table that the balls stuck to it. Once the game got started though, Lantier recovered his good humor and began to flaunt his extraordinary knack with a cue."
"Madame Fauconnier demanda la tête ; elle n'aimait que la tête. Mademoiselle Remanjou adorait les lardons. Et, comme Boche disait préférer les petits oignons, quand ils étaient bien revenus, madame Lerat pinça les lèvres, en murmurant :","Madame Fauconnier asked for the head; she only liked the head. Mademoiselle Remanjou loved bacon bits. And, as Boche said he preferred small onions, when they had come back nicely, Madame Lerat pursed her lips, murmuring:",Mme Fauconnier begged for the head—she adored the head—and Boche asked especially for onions. Mme Lerat compressed her lips and said morosely:,"Madame Fauconnier asked for a head, she only liked that part. Mademoiselle Remanjou had a weakness for the slices of bacon. And as Boche said he preferred the little onions when they were nicely broiled, Madame Lerat screwed up her lips, and murmured:"
"Or, une après-midi, il y eut une scène affreuse. Ça devait arriver, d'ailleurs. Nana s'avisa d'un petit jeu bien drôle. Elle avait volé, devant la loge, un sabot à madame Boche. Elle l'attacha avec une ficelle, se mit à le traîner, comme une voiture. De son côté, Victor eut l'idée d'emplir le sabot de pelures de pomme. Alors, un cortège s'organisa. Nana marchait la première, tirant le sabot. Pauline et Victor s'avançaient à sa droite et à sa gauche. Puis, toute la flopée des mioches suivait en ordre, les grands d'abord, les petits ensuite, se bousculant ; un bébé en jupe, haut comme une botte, portant sur l'oreille un bourrelet défoncé, venait le dernier. Et le cortège chantait quelque chose de triste, des oh ! et des ah ! Nana avait dit qu'on allait jouer à l'enterrement ; les pelures de pomme, c'était le mort. Quand on eut fait le tour de la cour, on recommença. On trouvait ça joliment amusant.","Now, one afternoon, there was a dreadful scene. It had to happen, by the way. Nana thought of a very funny little game. She had stolen a sabot from Madame Boche in front of the box. She tied it with a string, began to drag it, like a car. For his part, Victor had the idea of filling the hoof with apple peelings. Then, a procession was organized. Nana walked first, pulling the hoof. Pauline and Victor advanced to his right and to his left. Then the whole slew of brats followed in order, the big ones first, the little ones next, jostling one another; a baby in a skirt, high as a boot, wearing a ragged roll over his ear, came last. And the procession was singing something sad, ohs! and ah! Nana had said we were going to play at the funeral; apple peels were dead. When we had made the tour of the yard, we started again. We thought it was pretty amusing.","One day there was a terrible scene. Nana had invented a beautiful game. She had stolen a wooden shoe belonging to Mme Boche; she bored a hole in it and put in a string, by which she could draw it like a cart. Victor filled it with apple parings, and they started forth in a procession, Nana drawing the shoe in front, followed by the whole flock, little and big, an imp about the height of a cigar box at the end. They all sang a melancholy ditty full of ""ahs"" and ""ohs."" Nana declared this to be always the custom at funerals.","Well, one afternoon there was a frightful scene. It was bound to have come sooner or later. Nana had thought of a very funny little game. She had stolen one of Madame Boche’s wooden shoes from outside the concierge’s room. She tied a string to it and began dragging it about like a cart. Victor on his side had had the idea to fill it with potato parings. Then a procession was formed. Nana came first dragging the wooden shoe. Pauline and Victor walked on her right and left. Then the entire crowd of urchins followed in order, the big ones first, the little ones next, jostling one another; a baby in long skirts about as tall as a boot with an old tattered bonnet cocked on one side of its head, brought up the rear. And the procession chanted something sad with plenty of ohs! and ahs! Nana had said that they were going to play at a funeral; the potato parings represented the body. When they had gone the round of the courtyard, they recommenced. They thought it immensely amusing."
"L'interne prit un pot de limonade sur une planchette et le lui donna. Il saisit le pot à deux mains, aspira goulûment une gorgée, en répandant la moitié du liquide sur lui ; mais il cracha tout de suite la gorgée, avec un dégoût furieux, en criant :","The intern took a jar of lemonade from a board and gave it to her. He seized the jar with both hands, greedily took a sip, spilling half of the liquid on himself; but he immediately spat out the mouthful, with furious disgust, crying:","The house surgeon took a glass of lemonade from a tray and gave it to him. He seized the glass in both hands, drank one swallow, spilling the whole of it at the same time.","The house surgeon handed him a little lemonade from a small shelf; Coupeau seized the mug in both hands and greedily took a mouthful, spilling half the liquid over himself; but he spat it out at once with furious disgust, exclaiming:"
"- Mais votre mariage ? Je ne puis pas prendre l'argent de votre mariage, bien sûr !","- But your marriage? I can't take your wedding money, of course!","""But your marriage? This is the money you have saved for that.""",“But your marriage? I certainly can’t take the money you’ve been saving for your marriage!”
- Hein ! ça nous dégotte joliment ! Mais peut-être que plus tard ça servira au bonheur de tous.,- Eh ! it disgusts us nicely! But maybe later it will be useful for everyone's happiness.,"In this way she had paid half the money she had borrowed, when one quarter day, not knowing to whom to turn, as she had not been able to collect her bills punctually, she ran to the Goujets' and borrowed the amount of her rent from them.",“Well! That machine would certainly win a contest. But perhaps it will be for the good of mankind in the long run.”
"Ah ! tonnerre ! quel trou dans la blanquette ! Si l'on ne parlait guère, on mastiquait ferme. Le saladier se creusait, une cuiller plantée dans la sauce épaisse, une bonne sauce jaune qui tremblait comme une gelée. Là-dedans, on pêchait les morceaux de veau ; et il y en avait toujours, le saladier voyageait de main en main, les visages se penchaient et cherchaient des champignons. Les grands pains, posés contre le mur, derrière les convives, avaient l'air de fondre. Entre les bouchées, on entendait les culs des verres retomber sur la table. La sauce était un peu trop salée, il fallut quatre litres pour noyer cette bougresse de blanquette, qui s'avalait comme une crème et qui vous mettait un incendie dans le ventre. Et l'on n'eut pas le temps de souffler, l'épinée de cochon, montée sur un plat creux, flanquée de grosses pommes de terre rondes, arrivait au milieu d'un nuage. Il y eut un cri. Sacré nom ! c'était trouvé ! Tout le monde aimait ça. Pour le coup, on allait se mettre en appétit ; et chacun suivait le plat d'un œil oblique, en essuyant son couteau sur son pain, afin d'être prêt. Puis, lorsqu'on se fut servi, on se poussa du coude, on parla, la bouche pleine. Hein ? quel beurre, cette épinée ! quelque chose de doux et de solide qu'on sentait couler le long de son boyau, jusque dans ses bottes. Les pommes de terre étaient un sucre. Ça n'était pas salé ; mais, juste à cause des pommes de terre, ça demandait un coup d'arrosoir toutes les minutes. On cassa le goulot à quatre nouveaux litres. Les assiettes furent si proprement torchées, qu'on n'en changea pas pour manger les pois au lard. Oh ! les légumes ne tiraient pas à conséquence. On gobait ça à pleine cuiller, en s'amusant. De la vraie gourmandise enfin, comme qui dirait le plaisir des dames. Le meilleur, dans les pois, c'étaient les lardons, grillés à point, puant le sabot de cheval. Deux litres suffirent.","Ah! thunder ! what a hole in the blanquette! If we hardly spoke, we chewed hard. The salad bowl was sinking, a spoon planted in the thick sauce, a good yellow sauce which quivered like jelly. In there, we fished the pieces of veal; and there were always some, the salad bowl traveled from hand to hand, the faces leaned over and looked for mushrooms. The large loaves, placed against the wall, behind the guests, seemed to melt. Between mouthfuls, you could hear the bottoms of the glasses falling on the table. The sauce was a little too salty, it took four liters to drown this bougresse of blanquette, which was swallowed like a cream and which put a fire in your stomach. And we didn't have time to breathe, the pork loin, mounted on a hollow dish, flanked by large round potatoes, arrived in the middle of a cloud. There was a cry. Holy name! it was found! Everyone liked that. For once, we were going to work up an appetite; and each followed the dish with oblique eyes, wiping his knife on his bread, in order to be ready. Then, when we had helped ourselves, we nudged each other, we talked, our mouths full. Eh ? what butter, this spiny! something soft and solid that you could feel flowing down his gut, even into his boots. Potatoes were a sugar. It wasn't salty; but, just because of the potatoes, it required a watering can every minute. We broke the neck to four new liters. The plates were so cleanly wiped that they were not changed to eat the peas with bacon. Oh ! the vegetables were of no consequence. We swallowed it wholeheartedly, having fun. Real gluttony finally, as one would say the pleasure of the ladies. The best part of the peas was the bacon bits, grilled to perfection, smelling of horse's hoof. Two liters was enough.",The veal was a great success; the sauce was delicious and the mushrooms extraordinarily good. Then came the sparerib of pork. Of course all these good things demanded a large amount of wine.,"Ah! thunder! What a hole they were making in the stewed veal! If they spoke little, they were chewing in earnest. The salad-bowl was becoming emptier and emptier with a spoon stuck in the midst of the thick sauce—a good yellow sauce which quivered like a jelly. They fished pieces of veal out of it and seemed as though they would never come to the end; the salad-bowl journeyed from hand to hand and faces bent over it as forks picked out the mushrooms. The long loaves standing against the wall behind the guests appeared to melt away. Between the mouthfuls one could hear the sound of glasses being replaced on the table. The sauce was a trifle too salty. It required four bottles of wine to drown that blessed stewed veal, which went down like cream, but which afterwards lit up a regular conflagration in one’s stomach. And before one had time to take a breath, the pig’s back, in the middle of a deep dish surrounded by big round potatoes, arrived in the midst of a cloud of smoke. There was one general cry. By Jove! It was just the thing! Everyone liked it. They would do it justice; and they followed the dish with a side glance as they wiped their knives on their bread so as to be in readiness. Then as soon as they were helped they nudged one another and spoke with their mouths full. It was just like butter! Something sweet and solid which one could feel run through one’s guts right down into one’s boots. The potatoes were like sugar. It was not a bit salty; only, just on account of the potatoes, it required a wetting every few minutes. Four more bottles were placed on the table. The plates were wiped so clean that they also served for the green peas and bacon. Oh! vegetables were of no consequence. They playfully gulped them down in spoonfuls. The best part of the dish was the small pieces of bacon just nicely grilled and smelling like horse’s hoof. Two bottles were sufficient for them."

"Elle expliquait ses poupées à Mes-Bottes, dont les mâchoires, lentement, roulaient comme des meules. Il n'écoutait pas, il hochait la tête, guettant les garçons, pour ne pas leur laisser emporter les plats sans les avoir torchés. On avait mangé un fricandeau au jus et des haricots verts. On apportait le rôti, deux poulets maigres, couchés sur un lit de cresson, fané et cuit par le four. Au-dehors, le soleil mourait sur les branches hautes des acacias. Dans la salle, le reflet verdâtre s'épaississait des buées montant de la table, tachée de vin et de sauce, encombrée de la débâcle du couvert ; et, le long du mur, des assiettes sales, des litres vides, posés là par les garçons, semblaient les ordures balayées et culbutées de la nappe. Il faisait très chaud. Les hommes retirèrent leurs redingotes et continuèrent à manger en manches de chemise.","She explained her dolls to My-Boots, whose jaws slowly rolled like millstones. He wasn't listening, he was shaking his head, watching the waiters, so as not to let them take the dishes away without having wiped them. We had eaten a fricandeau au jus and green beans. They brought the roast, two lean chickens, lying on a bed of watercress, wilted and cooked in the oven. Outside, the sun was dying on the high branches of the acacias. In the dining room, the greenish reflection grew thicker from the mist rising from the table, stained with wine and sauce, encumbered by the debacle of the cutlery; and, along the wall, dirty plates, empty gallons, placed there by the waiters, looked like garbage swept and tumbled from the tablecloth. It was very hot. The men took off their frock coats and continued to eat in their shirt sleeves.","She was describing her dolls to Mes-Bottes, whose jaws worked steadily, like machinery. He did not listen, but he nodded at intervals, with his eyes fixed on the garçons to see that they carried away no dishes that were not emptied. There had been veal cutlets and string beans served. As a roti, two lean chickens on a bed of water cresses were brought in. The room was growing very warm; the sun was lingering on the tops of the acacias, but the room was growing dark. The men threw off their coats and ate in their shirt sleeves.","She was explaining how she dressed her dolls to My-Boots, whose jaws were working slowly like grindstones. He did not listen, though he kept nodding his head, but looked after the waiters to prevent them removing any of the dishes he had not cleaned out. They had now finished a veal stew with green beans. The roast was brought in, two scrawny chickens resting on a bed of water cress which was limp from the warming oven. Outside, only the higher branches of the acacias were touched by the setting sun. Inside, the greenish reflected light was thickened by wisps of steam rising from the table, now messy with spilled wine and gravy and the debris of the dinner. Along the wall were dirty dishes and empty bottles which the waiters had piled there like a heap of refuse. It was so hot that the men took off their jackets and continued eating in their shirt sleeves."

She looked at him fixedly.","“Ah! so that’s what upsets you?” said the zinc-worker, without ceasing to chuckle. “Yes, you want your share. Then, big goose, why do you refuse a drink?

"Ils s'empoignaient ainsi, à chacune de leurs rencontres. Gervaise, qui n'aimait pas les discussions, intervenait d'ordinaire. Elle sortit de la torpeur où la plongeait la vue de la malle, toute pleine du parfum gâté de son ancien amour ; et elle montra les verres aux trois hommes.","They grabbed each other like this, at each of their meetings. Gervaise, who did not like discussions, usually intervened. She arose from the torpor into which the sight of the trunk had plunged her, full of the spoiled perfume of her former love; and she showed the glasses to the three men.","That is needed in the cause of morality."" Poisson threw back his head, ready for an argument, but Gervaise, who did not like discussions, interfered. She had recovered from the torpor into which she had been plunged by the sight of this trunk, and she asked the men to take another glass.","They always quarreled thus every time they met. Gervaise, who did not like arguments, usually interfered. She roused herself from the torpor into which the sight of the box, full of the stale perfume of her past love, had plunged her, and she drew the three men’s attention to the glasses."
Les deux femmes ne parurent pas surprises.,The two women did not seem surprised.,The two women did not appear either shocked or surprised.,The other two women did not seem at all surprised.
Malheur au flibustier !,Woe to the buccaneer!,"Mme Putois started up and began a fierce piratical song, standing stiff and erect in her black dress, her pale face surrounded by her black lace cap, and gesticulating violently.","The buccaneer slaughter,"
"- C'est du propre ! ? Je les ai entendus cette nuit. Oui, oui, la Banban et le chapelier ? Et ils menaient un train ! Coupeau est joli. C'est du propre !","- It's clean ! ? I heard them last night. Yes, yes, the Banban and the hatter? And they were leading a train! Coupeau is pretty. It's clean !","At the height of her illness it so happened that her two daughters met one afternoon at her bedside. Their mother made a motion to them to come closer. Then she went on to tell them, between paroxysms of coughing, that her son came home dead drunk the night before and that she was absolutely certain that Gervaise spent the night in Lantier's room.","“It’s becoming indecent. I heard them last night. Yes, Clump-clump and the hatter. And they were kicking up such a row together! Coupeau’s too decent for her.” And she related in short sentences, coughing and choking between each, that her son had come home dead drunk the night before."
"- Moi, reprenait madame Putois, j'ai eu pour amie une femme qui avait un ver ? Oh ! ces animaux-là ont des caprices ! ? Il lui tortillait le ventre, quand elle ne lui donnait pas du poulet. Vous pensez, le mari gagnait sept francs, ça passait en gourmandises pour le ver ?","- Me, resumed Madame Putois, I had for a friend a woman who had a worm? Oh ! these animals have quirks! ? He twirled her stomach when she wasn't giving him chicken. Do you think, the husband earned seven francs, that passed in delicacies for the worm?","The women did not move; they were lulled to apathy by the heat, and Gervaise herself found it very difficult to resume her labors.",Gervaise shook herself and got to her feet.
"Et la noce monta. Dans l'étroite spirale de l'escalier, les douze grimpaient à la file, butant contre les marches usées, se tenant aux murs. Puis, quand l'obscurité devint complète, ce fut une bosse de rires. Les dames poussaient de petits cris. Les messieurs les chatouillaient, leur pinçaient les jambes. Mais elles étaient bien bêtes de causer ! on a l'air de croire que ce sont des souris. D'ailleurs, ça restait sans conséquence ; ils savaient s'arrêter où il fallait, pour l'honnêteté. Puis, Boche trouva une plaisanterie que toute la société répéta. On appelait madame Gaudron, comme si elle était restée en chemin, et on lui demandait si son ventre passait. Songez donc ! si elle s'était trouvée prise là, sans pouvoir monter ni descendre, elle aurait bouché le trou, on n'aurait jamais su comment s'en aller. Et l'on riait de ce ventre de femme enceinte, avec une gaieté formidable qui secouait la colonne. Ensuite, Boche, tout à fait lancé, déclara qu'on se faisait vieux, dans ce tuyau de cheminée ; ça ne finissait donc pas, on allait donc au ciel ? Et il cherchait à effrayer les dames, en criant que ça remuait. Cependant, Coupeau ne disait rien ; il venait derrière Gervaise, la tenait à la taille, la sentait s'abandonner. Lorsque, brusquement, on rentra dans le jour, il était juste en train de lui embrasser le cou.","And the wedding went up. In the narrow spiral of the staircase, the twelve climbed in a row, stumbling against the worn steps, clinging to the walls. Then, when the darkness became complete, there was a burst of laughter. The ladies squealed. The gentlemen tickled them, pinched their legs. But they were very stupid to talk! we seem to believe that they are mice. Besides, it remained without consequence; they knew how to stop where it was necessary, for honesty. Then Boche found a joke that the whole company repeated. They called Madame Gaudron, as if she had stayed on the way, and asked her if her stomach was passing. So think! if she had been caught there, unable to go up or down, she would have blocked the hole, we would never have known how to get out. And they laughed at this pregnant woman's belly, with a formidable gaiety that shook the spine. Then, Boche, completely launched, declared that we were getting old, in this chimney flue; So it didn't end, so we were going to heaven? And he was trying to frighten the ladies, shouting that it was stirring. However, Coupeau said nothing; he came up behind Gervaise, held her by the waist, felt her surrender. When, suddenly, daylight dawned, he was just kissing her neck.","And the procession began the ascent of the spiral staircase, which Boche said was so old that he could feel it shake. This terrified the ladies, who uttered little shrieks, but Coupeau said nothing; his arm was around his wife's waist, and just as they emerged upon the platform he kissed her.","And the whole party ascended. In the narrow space afforded by the spiral staircase, the twelve persons crawled up one after the other, stumbling against the worn steps, and clinging to the walls. Then, when the obscurity became complete, they almost split their sides with laughing. The ladies screamed when the gentlemen pinched their legs. But they were weren’t stupid enough to say anything! The proper plan is to think that it is the mice nibbling at them. It wasn’t very serious; the men knew when to stop. Boche thought of a joke and everyone took it up. They called down to Madame Gaudron to ask her if she could squeeze her belly through. Just think! If she should get stuck there, she would completely block the passage, and how would they ever get out? They laughed so at the jokes about her belly that the column itself vibrated. Boche was now quite carried away and declared that they were growing old climbing up this chimney pipe. Was it ever coming to an end, or did it go right up to heaven? He tried to frighten the ladies by telling them the structure was shaking. Coupeau, meanwhile, said nothing. He was behind Gervaise, with his arm around her waist, and felt that she was everything perfect to him. When they suddenly emerged again into the daylight, he was just in the act of kissing her on the cheek."
"Il ne parlait plus, il restait souriant ; et, lentement, il la baisa sur l'oreille, ainsi qu'il la baisait autrefois pour la taquiner et l'étourdir. Alors, elle fut sans force, elle sentit un grand bourdonnement, un grand frisson descendre dans sa chair. Pourtant, elle fit de nouveau un pas. Et elle dut reculer. Ce n'était pas possible, la dégoûtation était si grande, l'odeur devenait telle, qu'elle se serait elle-même mal conduite dans ses draps. Coupeau, comme sur de la plume, assommé par l'ivresse, cuvait sa bordée, les membres morts, la gueule de travers. Toute la rue aurait bien pu entrer embrasser sa femme, sans qu'un poil de son corps en remuât. - Tant pis, bégayait-elle, c'est sa faute, je ne puis pas ? Ah ! mon Dieu ! ah ! mon Dieu ! il me renvoie de mon lit, je n'ai plus de lit ? Non, je ne puis pas, c'est sa faute.","He no longer spoke, he remained smiling; and slowly he kissed her on the ear, as he used to kiss her to tease and stun her. Then, she was without strength, she felt a great buzzing, a great shiver go down in her flesh. However, she took another step. And she had to step back. It wasn't possible, the disgust was so great, the smell was becoming such that she would have misbehaved herself in her sheets. Coupeau, as if on a feather, stunned by intoxication, was sleeping off his broadside, his limbs dead, his mouth askew. The whole street could well have come in to kiss his wife, without a hair on her body stirring. - Never mind, she stammered, it's her fault, I can't? Ah! my God ! ah! my God ! he sends me out of my bed, I have no more bed? No, I can't, it's his fault.","He said no more but slowly and softly kissed her on her ear, as he had so often teased her by doing in those old days. Gervaise shivered, and her blood was stirred to madness in her veins. ""What does that beast care? "" she thought. ""It is his fault,"" she murmured; ""all his fault. He sends me from his room!""","Then he began to kiss her on the ear just as in the old days. Gervaise felt like sobbing. Her strength deserted her; she felt a great buzzing in her ears, a violent tremor passed through her. She advanced another step forward. And she was again obliged to draw back. It was not possible, the disgust was too great. She felt on the verge of vomiting herself. Coupeau, overpowered by intoxication, lying as comfortably as though on a bed of down, was sleeping off his booze, without life in his limbs, and with his mouth all on one side. The whole street might have entered and laughed at him, without a hair of his body moving. “Well, I can’t help it,” she faltered. “It’s his own fault. Mon Dieu! He’s forcing me out of my own bed. I’ve no bed any longer. No, I can’t help it. It’s his own fault.”"
"- Dites donc, murmurait-il, il ne faut pas me la faire !","- Hey, he murmured, you mustn't do it to me!","""What are you talking about?"" he muttered.","“Look here,” murmured he, “no jokes!”"
"Elle était sèche comme un échalas, menait une vie d'ouvrière cloîtrée dans son train-train, n'avait pas vu le nez d'un homme chez elle depuis son veuvage, tout en montrant une préoccupation continuelle de l'ordure, une manie de mots à double entente et d'allusions polissonnes, d'une telle profondeur, qu'elle seule se comprenait. Boche, se penchant et réclamant une explication, tout bas, à l'oreille, elle reprit :","She was dry as a stake, led the life of a cloistered worker in her routine, had not seen the nose of a man in her house since her widowhood, while showing a continual preoccupation with filth, a mania for double meaning words and naughty allusions, of such depth that only she understood herself. Boche, leaning over and asking for an explanation, she whispered in her ear and went on:","Mme Lerat was a hard-working woman. No man had ever put his nose within her door since her widowhood, and yet her instincts were thoroughly bad; every word uttered by others bore to her ears a double meaning, a coarse allusion sometimes so deeply veiled that no one but herself could grasp its meaning. Boche leaned over her with a sensual smile and entreated an explanation. She shook her head. ""Of course,"" she repeated.","She was a dried up stick, living the cloistered life of a hard-working woman imprisoned within her daily routine, who had never had a man stick his nose into her room since the death of her husband; yet she had an obsession with double meanings and indecent allusions that were sometimes so far off the mark that only she understood them. As Boche leaned toward her and, in a whisper, asked for an explanation, she resumed:"
"- Oh ! ce n'est pas possible, je comprends ? Adieu, adieu, car ça nous étoufferait tous les deux.","- Oh ! it's not possible, I understand? Goodbye, goodbye, because it would suffocate us both.","Farewell!""","Oh! it isn’t possible you still love me. Good-bye, good-bye; it would smother us both; it would be more than we could stand.”"
"Gervaise était retournée s'asseoir, désillusionnée, trouvant tout très laid. Elle sourit pour faire plaisir aux Lorilleux. Ce qui la gênait surtout, c'était le silence gardé sur son mariage, sur cette affaire si grosse pour elle, sans laquelle elle ne serait certainement pas venue. Les Lorilleux continuaient à la traiter en curieuse importune amenée par Coupeau. Et une conversation s'étant enfin engagée, elle roula uniquement sur les locataires de la maison. Madame Lorilleux demanda à son frère s'il n'avait pas entendu en montant les gens du quatrième se battre. Ces Bénard s'assommaient tous les jours ; le mari rentrait soûl comme un cochon ; la femme aussi avait bien des torts, elle criait des choses dégoûtantes. Puis, on parla du dessinateur du premier, ce grand escogriffe de Baudequin, un poseur criblé de dettes, toujours fumant, toujours gueulant avec des camarades. L'atelier de cartonnage de M. Madinier n'allait plus que d'une patte ; le patron avait encore congédié deux ouvrières la veille ; ce serait pain bénit s'il faisait la culbute, car il mangeait tout, il laissait ses enfants le derrière nu. Madame Gaudron cardait drôlement ses matelas : elle se trouvait encore enceinte, ce qui finissait par n'être guère propre, à son âge. Le propriétaire venait de donner congé aux Coquet du cinquième ; ils devaient trois termes ; puis, ils s'entêtaient à allumer leur fourneau sur le carré ; même que, le samedi d'auparavant, mademoiselle Remanjou, la vieille du sixième, en reportant ses poupées, était descendue à temps pour empêcher le petit Linguerlot d'avoir le corps tout brûlé. Quant à mademoiselle Clémence, la repasseuse, elle se conduisait comme elle l'entendait, mais on ne pouvait pas dire, elle adorait les animaux, elle possédait un cœur d'or. Hein ! quel dommage, une belle fille pareille aller avec tous les hommes ! On la rencontrerait une nuit sur un trottoir, pour sûr.","Gervaise had gone back to her seat, disillusioned, finding everything very ugly. She smiled to please the Lorilleuxs. What bothered her above all was the silence kept on her marriage, on this matter so big for her, without which she would certainly not have come. The Lorilleuxs continued to treat her as a curious intruder brought in by Coupeau. And a conversation having finally begun, it rolled only on the tenants of the house. Madame Lorilleux asked her brother if he hadn't heard the people on the fourth floor fighting. These Bénards were knocked out every day; the husband came home drunk as a pig; the woman had many wrongs too, she was shouting disgusting things. Then, we talked about the designer of the first, that great swindler Baudequin, a debt-ridden poseur, always smoking, always yelling with his comrades. M. Madinier's cardboard workshop was going by only one leg; the boss had fired two more workers the day before; it would be holy bread if he tumbled, for he ate everything, he left his children bare behind. Madame Gaudron carded her mattresses oddly: she was still pregnant, which ended up being hardly proper, at her age. The proprietor had just given leave to the Coquets of the fifth floor; they owed three terms; then they persisted in lighting their stove on the square; even as, on the previous Saturday, Mademoiselle Remanjou, the old woman from the sixth floor, had brought her dolls back downstairs in time to prevent little Linguerlot from having his body all burned. As for Mademoiselle Clémence, the ironer, she behaved as she liked, but you couldn't tell, she adored animals, she had a heart of gold. Eh ! what a pity, such a beautiful girl goes with all the men! We would meet her one night on a sidewalk, for sure.","She thought it was all very ugly and uninteresting. She smiled in order to gratify the Lorilleuxs, but she was annoyed and troubled at the profound silence they preserved in regard to her marriage, on account of which she had called there that evening. These people treated her as if she were simply a spectator whose curiosity had induced Coupeau to bring her to see their work. They began to talk; it was about the lodgers in the house. Mme Lorilleux asked her brother if he had not heard those Benard people quarreling as he came upstairs. She said the husband always came home tipsy. Then she spoke of the designer, who was overwhelmed with debts, always smoking and always quarreling. The landlord was going to turn out the Coquets, who owed three quarters now and who would put their furnace out on the landing, which was very dangerous. Mlle Remanjon, as she was going downstairs with a bundle of dolls, was just in time to rescue one of the children from being burned alive. Gervaise was beginning to find the place unendurable. The heat was suffocating; the door could not be opened, because the slightest draft gave Lorilleux a cold.","Gervaise had returned to her seat, disenchanted and thinking everything very ugly. She smiled to be polite to the Lorilleuxs. The complete silence about her marriage bothered her. It was the sole reason for her having come. The Lorilleuxs were treating her as some stranger brought in by Coupeau. When a conversation finally did get started, it concerned the building’s tenants. Madame Lorilleux asked her husband if he had heard the people on the fourth floor having a fight. They fought every day. The husband usually came home drunk and the wife had her faults too, yelling in the filthiest language. Then they spoke of the designer on the first floor, an uppity show-off with a mound of debts, always smoking, always arguing loudly with his friends. Monsieur Madinier’s cardboard business was barely surviving. He had let two girl workers go yesterday. The business ate up all his money, leaving his children to run around in rags. And that Madame Gaudron was pregnant again; this was almost indecent at her age. The landlord was going to evict the Coquets on the fifth floor. They owed nine months’ rent, and besides, they insisted on lighting their stove out on the landing. Last Saturday the old lady on the sixth floor, Mademoiselle Remanjou, had arrived just in time to save the Linguerlot child from being badly burned. Mademoiselle Clemence, one who took in ironing, well, she lived life as she pleased. She was so kind to animals though and had such a good heart that you couldn’t say anything against her. It was a pity, a fine girl like her, the company she kept. She’d be walking the streets before long."
"Elle hocha le menton ; elle savait bien que ça se voyait ; à quarante ans, elle se casserait en deux. Puis, doucement, avec un léger rire :","She nodded; she knew very well that it showed; at forty she would break in two. Then, softly, with a light laugh:","She shook her head. She knew very well that it was very evident, and at forty it would be far worse, but she said softly, with a faint smile, ""You have a strange taste, to fall in love with a lame woman!""","She shook her head; she knew well enough that it could be seen; at forty she would look broken in two. Then she added gently, with a slight laugh: “It’s a funny fancy of yours to fall in love with a cripple.”"
- Vous n'avez pas vu ma femme ? demanda-t-il.,- You haven't seen my wife? he asked.,"""Have you seen my wife?"" he asked.",“Have you seen my wife?” asked he.
"D'ailleurs, dans la maison, il y avait un pullulement extraordinaire de mioches, des volées d'enfants qui dégringolaient les quatre escaliers à toutes les heures du jour, et s'abattaient sur le pavé, comme des bandes de moineaux criards et pillards. Madame Gaudron, à elle seule, en lâchait neuf, des blonds, des bruns, mal peignés, mal mouchés, avec des culottes jusqu'aux yeux, des bas tombés sur les souliers, des vestes fendues, montrant leur peau blanche sous la crasse. Une autre femme, une porteuse de pain, au cinquième, en lâchait sept. Il en sortait des tapées de toutes les chambres. Et, dans ce grouillement de vermines aux museaux roses, débarbouillés chaque fois qu'il pleuvait, on en voyait de grands, l'air ficelle, de gros, ventrus déjà comme des hommes, de petits, petits, échappés du berceau, mal d'aplomb encore, tout bêtes, marchant à quatre pattes quand ils voulaient courir. Nana régnait sur ce tas de crapauds ; elle faisait sa mademoiselle jordonne avec des filles deux fois plus grandes qu'elle, et daignait seulement abandonner un peu de son pouvoir à Pauline et à Victor, des confidents intimes qui appuyaient ses volontés. Cette fichue gamine parlait sans cesse de jouer à la maman, déshabillait les plus petits pour les rhabiller, voulait visiter les autres partout, les tripotait, exerçait un despotisme fantasque de grande personne ayant du vice. C'était, sous sa conduite, des jeux à se faire gifler. La bande pataugeait dans les eaux de couleur de la teinturerie, sortait de là les jambes teintes en bleu ou en rouge, jusqu'aux genoux ; puis, elle s'envolait chez le serrurier, où elle chipait des clous et de la limaille, et repartait pour aller s'abattre au milieu des copeaux du menuisier, des tas de copeaux énormes, amusants tout plein, dans lesquels on se roulait en montrant son derrière. La cour lui appartenait, retentissait du tapage des petits souliers se culbutant à la débandade, du cri perçant des voix qui s'enflaient chaque fois que la bande reprenait son vol. Certains jours même, la cour ne suffisait pas. Alors, la bande se jetait dans les caves, remontait, grimpait le long d'un escalier, enfilait un corridor, redescendait, reprenait un escalier, suivait un autre corridor, et cela sans se lasser, pendant des heures, gueulant toujours, ébranlant la maison géante d'un galop de bêtes nuisibles lâchées au fond de tous les coins.","Besides, in the house, there was an extraordinary swarm of brats, flocks of children who tumbled down the four staircases at all hours of the day, and fell on the pavement, like bands of screaming and looting sparrows. . Madame Gaudron alone released nine of them, blondes, dark-haired, badly combed, badly snuffed, with breeches up to their eyes, stockings falling over their shoes, split jackets, showing their white skin under the filth. Another woman, a bread carrier, on the fifth floor, dropped seven of them. Taps came out of all the rooms. And, in this swarm of vermin with rosy muzzles, washed clean every time it rained, you could see big ones, looking like strings, big ones, potbellied already like men, little ones, little ones, escaped from the cradle, badly still confident, very stupid, walking on all fours when they wanted to run. Nana reigned over this heap of toads; she acted as Mademoiselle Jordan with girls twice her size, and only condescended to give up a little of her power to Pauline and Victor, intimate confidants who supported her wishes. This damn kid was constantly talking about playing mommy, undressing the little ones to get them dressed again, wanting to visit the others everywhere, groping them, exercising the fantastic despotism of a grown-up with vice. It was, under his guidance, games to be slapped. The gang waded through the colored waters of the dyehouse, emerging from there with their legs dyed blue or red, up to their knees; then she would fly to the locksmith, where she would steal nails and filings, and set off again to go and swoop down in the middle of the carpenter's shavings, piles of enormous shavings, full of fun, in which we rolled around. showing her behind. The yard belonged to him, resounded with the din of little shoes tumbling in the stampede, with the piercing cry of voices which swelled each time the band resumed its flight. Some days even the yard was not enough. Then the band threw themselves into the cellars, went up, climbed along a staircase, threaded a corridor, descended again, resumed a staircase, followed another corridor, and that without getting tired, for hours, always yelling, shaking the giant house of a gallop of vermin unleashed at the bottom of every corner.","The whole great house resounded with the most extraordinary noises—the thumps of children falling downstairs, little feet tearing up one staircase and down another and bursting out on the sidewalk like a band of pilfering, impudent sparrows. Mme Gaudron alone had nine—dirty, unwashed and unkempt, their stockings hanging over their shoes and the slits in their garments showing the white skin beneath. Another woman on the fifth floor had seven, and they came out in twos and threes from all the rooms. Nana reigned over this band, among which there were some half grown and others mere infants. Her prime ministers were Pauline and Victor; to them she delegated a little of her authority while she played mamma, undressed the youngest only to dress them again, cuffed them and punished them at her own sweet will and with the most fantastic disposition. The band pranced and waded through the gutter that ran from the dyehouse and emerged with blue or green legs. Nana decorated herself and the others with shavings from the cabinetmaker's, which they stole from under the very noses of the workmen. The courtyard belonged to all of these children, apparently, and resounded with the clatter of their heels. Sometimes this courtyard, however, was not enough for them, and they spread in every direction to the infinite disgust of Mme Boche, who grumbled all in vain.","In the house, too, there was an extraordinary swarm of brats, flights of children who rolled down the four staircases at all hours of the day and alighted on the pavement of the courtyard like troops of noisy pillaging sparrows. Madame Gaudron was responsible for nine of them, all with uncombed hair, runny noses, hand-me-down clothes, saggy stockings and ripped jackets. Another woman on the sixth floor had seven of them. This hoard that only got their faces washed when it rained were in all shapes and sizes, fat, thin, big and barely out of the cradle. Nana reigned supreme over this host of urchins; she ordered about girls twice her own size, and only deigned to relinquish a little of her power in favor of Pauline and Victor, intimate confidants who enforced her commands. This precious chit was for ever wanting to play at being mamma, undressing the smallest ones to dress them again, insisting on examining the others all over, messing them about and exercising the capricious despotism of a grown-up person with a vicious disposition. Under her leadership they got up tricks for which they should have been well spanked. The troop paddled in the colored water from the dyer’s and emerged from it with legs stained blue or red as high as the knees; then off it flew to the locksmith’s where it purloined nails and filings and started off again to alight in the midst of the carpenter’s shavings, enormous heaps of shavings, which delighted it immensely and in which it rolled head over heels exposing their behinds. The courtyard was her kingdom. It echoed with the clatter of little shoes as they stampeded back and forth with piercing cries. On some days the courtyard was too small for them and the troop would dash down into the cellar, race up a staircase, run along a corridor, then dash up another staircase and follow another corridor for hours. They never got tired of their yelling and clambering."
"Gervaise resta suffoquée. Elle avait complètement oublié la boutique. Mais elle voyait la joie mauvaise de ces gens, à la pensée que désormais la boutique était flambée. Dès ce soir-là, en effet, ils guettèrent les occasions pour la plaisanter sur son rêve tombé à l'eau. Quand on parlait d'un espoir irréalisable, ils renvoyaient la chose au jour où elle serait patronne, dans un beau magasin, donnant sur la rue. Et, derrière elle, c'étaient des gorges chaudes. Elle ne voulait pas faire d'aussi vilaines suppositions ; mais, en vérité, les Lorilleux avaient l'air maintenant d'être très contents de l'accident de Coupeau, qui l'empêchait de s'établir blanchisseuse, rue de la Goutte-d'Or.","Gervaise was suffocated. She had completely forgotten about the store. But she saw the wicked joy of these people, at the thought that henceforth the shop was in flames. From that evening, in fact, they watched for opportunities to joke about her dream that had fallen through. When we spoke of an unrealizable hope, they postponed the thing to the day when she would be patroness, in a beautiful store, overlooking the street. And behind her were warm gorges. She didn't want to make such ugly assumptions; but, in truth, the Lorilleuxs now seemed to be very happy with Coupeau's accident, which prevented her from establishing herself as a laundress in the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or.","Gervaise gasped. She had utterly forgotten the shop. She saw the delight of these people when they believed that this plan was given up, and from that day they never lost an occasion of twitting her on her dream that had toppled over like a house of cards, and she grew morbid and fancied they were pleased at the accident to their brother which had prevented the realization of their plans.","Gervaise was astonished. She had completely forgotten the shop; but she saw the wicked joy of those people, at the thought that she would no longer be able to take it, and she was bursting with anger. From that evening, in fact, they watched for every opportunity to twit her about her hopeless dream. When any one spoke of some impossible wish, they would say that it might be realized on the day that Gervaise started in business, in a beautiful shop opening onto the street. And behind her back they would laugh fit to split their sides. She did not like to think such an unkind thing, but, really, the Lorilleuxs now seemed to be very pleased at Coupeau’s accident, as it prevented her setting up as a laundress in the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or."
"- Vous regardiez la maison. C'est toujours loué du haut en bas. Il y a trois cents locataires, je crois ? Moi, si j'avais eu des meubles, j'aurais guetté un cabinet ? On serait bien ici, n'est-ce pas ?","- You were looking at the house. It's always rented from top to bottom. There are three hundred tenants, I believe? Me, if I had had furniture, I would have watched for a cabinet? We would be good here, wouldn't we?","You are looking at this house,"" he continued. "" Think of it —it is always lit from top to bottom. There are a hundred lodgers in it. If I had any furniture I would have had a room in it long ago. It would be very nice here, wouldn't it?""","“You were looking at the house. It’s always all let from the top to the bottom. There are three hundred lodgers, I think. If I had any furniture, I would have secured a small room. One would be comfortable here, don’t you think so?”"
"Mais Zidore ne se pressait pas. Il s'intéressait aux toits voisins, à une grosse fumée qui montait au fond de Paris, du côté de Grenelle ; ça pouvait bien être un incendie. Pourtant, il vint se mettre à plat ventre, la tête au-dessus du trou ; et il passa les fers à Coupeau. Alors, celui-ci commença à souder la feuille. Il s'accroupissait, s'allongeait, trouvant toujours son équilibre, assis d'une fesse, perché sur la pointe d'un pied, retenu par un doigt. Il avait un sacré aplomb, un toupet du tonnerre, familier, bravant le danger. Ça le connaissait. C'était la rue qui avait peur de lui. Comme il ne lâchait pas sa pipe, il se tournait de temps à autre, il crachait paisiblement dans la rue.","But Zidore was in no hurry. He was interested in the neighboring roofs, in a thick smoke rising in the depths of Paris, on the side of Grenelle; it could well be a fire. However, he came and lay down on his stomach, his head above the hole; and he put the irons on Coupeau. So, this one began to weld the sheet. He squatted, stretched out, always finding his balance, sitting with one buttocks, perched on tiptoe, held by one finger. He had a hell of a nerve, a thunderous cheek, familiar, defying danger. It knew him. It was the street that was afraid of him. As he did not let go of his pipe, he turned from time to time, he spat peacefully in the street.","But Zidore, quite undisturbed, continued to stare at a cloud of heavy black smoke that was rising in the direction of Grenelle. He wondered if it were a fire, but he crawled with the irons toward Coupeau, who began to solder the zinc, supporting himself on the point of one foot or by one finger, not rashly, but with calm deliberation and perfect coolness. He knew what he could do and never lost his head. His pipe was in his mouth, and he would occasionally turn to spit down into the street below.","But Zidore did not hurry himself. He was interested in the neighboring roofs, and in a cloud of smoke which rose from the other side of Paris, close to Grenelle; it was very likely a fire. However, he came and laid down on his stomach, his head over the opening, and he passed the irons to Coupeau. Then the latter commenced to solder the sheet. He squatted, he stretched, always managing to balance himself, sometimes seated on one side, at other times standing on the tip of one foot, often only holding on by a finger. He had a confounded assurance, the devil’s own cheek, familiar with danger, and braving it. It knew him. It was the street that was afraid, not he. As he kept his pipe in his mouth, he turned round every now and then to spit onto the pavement."
"Quand Gervaise remonta chez elle, elle trouva Coupeau assis au bord du lit, dans l'hébétement d'une de ses crises. Il regardait le carreau de ses yeux morts. Alors, elle s'assit elle-même sur une chaise, les membres cassés, les mains tombées le long de sa jupe sale. Et, pendant un quart d'heure, elle resta en face de lui, sans rien dire.","When Gervaise went back upstairs, she found Coupeau sitting on the edge of the bed, dazed by one of his attacks. He looked at the pane of his dead eyes. So she sat down herself on a chair, her limbs broken, her hands falling down her dirty skirt. And for a quarter of an hour she remained facing him, without saying a word.","When Gervaise went back to her room she found Coupeau sitting on the side of the bed, weeping and moaning. She took a chair near by and looked at him without speaking.","When Gervaise went back upstairs, she found Coupeau seated on the bed, in the torpid state induced by one of his attacks. He was looking at the window-panes with his dim expressionless eyes. She sat herself down on a chair, tired out, her hands hanging beside her dirty skirt; and for a quarter of an hour she remained in front of him without saying a word."
"- Oh ! le cochon ! le cochon ! répétait Gervaise indignée, exaspérée. Il a tout sali ? Non, un chien n'aurait pas fait ça, un chien crevé est plus propre.","- Oh ! the pig ! the pig ! repeated Gervaise indignantly, exasperated. He messed up everything? No, a dog wouldn't have done that, a dead dog is cleaner.","The sleepy concierge muttered some unintelligible words, from which Gervaise finally gathered that Coupeau had been brought in by Poisson and that the key was in the door.","“Oh! the pig! the pig!” repeated Gervaise, indignant and exasperated. “He’s dirtied everything. No, a dog wouldn’t have done that, even a dead dog is cleaner.”"
"- Je leur ai parlé de vous, ils connaissent nos projets, expliquait-il à Gervaise. Mon Dieu ! que vous êtes enfant ! Venez ce soir ? Je vous ai avertie, n'est-ce pas ? Vous trouverez ma sœur un peu raide. Lorilleux non plus n'est pas toujours aimable. Au fond, ils sont très vexés, parce que, si je me marie, je ne mangerai plus chez eux, et ce sera une économie de moins. Mais ça ne fait rien, ils ne vous mettront pas à la porte ? Faites ça pour moi, c'est absolument nécessaire.","- I told them about you, they know our plans, he explained to Gervaise. My God ! you are a child! Come tonight? I warned you, didn't I? You will find my sister a little stiff. Lorilleux isn't always friendly either. Basically, they are very annoyed, because if I get married, I won't eat at their house any more, and that will be less savings. But it doesn't matter, they won't kick you out? Do this for me, it's absolutely necessary.","""I have told them about you,"" he said. ""Gervaise—good heavens, what a baby you are! Come there tonight with me; you will find my sister a little stiff, and Lorilleux is none too amiable. The truth is they are much vexed, because, you see, if I marry I shall no longer dine with them—and that is their great economy. But that makes no odds; they won't put you out of doors. Do what I ask, for it is absolutely necessary.""","“I have spoken to them of you, they know our plans,” explained he to Gervaise. “Come now! What a child you are! Let’s call on them this evening. I’ve warned you, haven’t I? You’ll find my sister rather stiff. Lorilleux, too, isn’t always very amiable. In reality they are greatly annoyed, because if I marry, I shall no longer take my meals with them, and it’ll be an economy the less. But that doesn’t matter, they won’t turn you out. Do this for me, it’s absolutely necessary.”"
"Mais il ne put continuer. Gervaise, sans violence, l'empoignait d'une main et lui posait l'autre main sur la bouche. Il se débattit, par manière de blague, pendant qu'elle le poussait au fond de la boutique, vers la chambre. Il dégagea sa bouche, il dit qu'il voulait bien se coucher, mais que la grande blonde allait venir lui chauffer les petons. Puis, on entendit Gervaise lui ôter ses souliers. Elle le déshabillait, en le bourrant un peu, maternellement. Lorsqu'elle tira sur sa culotte, il creva de rire, s'abandonnant, renversé, vautré au beau milieu du lit ; et il gigotait, il racontait qu'elle lui faisait des chatouilles. Enfin, elle l'emmaillota avec soin, comme un enfant. Était-il bien, au moins ? Mais il ne répondit pas, il cria à Clémence :","But he couldn't go on. Gervaise, without violence, seized him with one hand and put the other hand on his mouth. He struggled, jokingly, as she pushed him to the back of the shop, toward the bedroom. He freed his mouth, he said he wanted to go to bed, but the tall blonde was going to warm his toes. Then they heard Gervaise take off his shoes. She undressed him, stuffing him a little, maternally. When she tugged on her panties, he burst out laughing, letting himself go, knocked over, sprawled in the middle of the bed; and he was fidgeting, he was saying that she was tickling him. Finally, she swaddled him carefully, like a child. Was he good, at least? But he did not answer, he shouted to Clemence:",Gervaise undressed her husband and tucked him up in bed as if he had been a child and then returned to her fluting irons in time to still a grand dispute that was going on about an iron that had not been properly cleaned.,"But he was unable to continue. Gervaise very calmly seized hold of him with one hand, and placed the other on his mouth. He struggled, just by way of a joke, whilst she pushed him to the back of the shop, towards the bedroom. He got his mouth free and said that he was willing to go to bed, but that the tall blonde must come and warm his feet. Then Gervaise could be heard taking off his shoes. She removed his clothes too, bullying him in a motherly way. He burst out laughing after she had removed his trousers and kicked about, pretending that she was tickling him. At last she tucked him in carefully like a child. Was he comfortable now? But he did not answer; he called to Clemence:"
"Alors, avec son entêtement, il lui demanda encore si elle voulait. Dès qu'ils auraient un lit, ils loueraient là. Mais elle se sauvait, elle se hâtait sous le porche, en le priant de ne pas recommencer ses bêtises. La maison pouvait crouler, elle n'y coucherait bien sûr pas sous là même couverture que lui. Pourtant, Coupeau, en la quittant devant l'atelier de madame Fauconnier, put garder un instant dans la sienne sa main qu'elle lui abandonnait en toute amitié.","So, with his stubbornness, he asked her again if she wanted to. As soon as they had a bed, they would rent there. But she ran away, she hurried to the porch, begging him not to start his nonsense again. The house could collapse, of course she wouldn't sleep there under the same blanket as him. However, Coupeau, on leaving her in front of Madame Fauconnier's studio, was able to hold her hand for a moment, which she left him in friendship.","See how pretty that is!"" He, with his usual recklessness, declared he would hire that room for her, and they would live there together. She turned away with a laugh and begged him not to talk any more nonsense. The house might stand or fall—they would never have a room in it together. But Coupeau, all the same, was not reproved when he held her hand longer than was necessary in bidding her farewell when they reached Mme Fauconnier's laundry.","The zinc-worker’s obstinate desire made him ask her once more whether she would or she wouldn’t. They could rent a place here as soon as they found a bed. She hurried out the arched entranceway, asking him not to start that subject again. There was as much chance of this building collapsing as there was of her sleeping under the same blanket with him. Still, when Coupeau left her in front of Madame Fauconnier’s shop, he was allowed to hold her hand for a moment."
"Coupeau, cette fois, éclata. Est-ce qu'il allait faire son andouille encore longtemps ? Quand on lui disait que c'était de bon cœur ! Il leur rendrait service, là, comprenait-il ! Puis, d'une voix furibonde, il gueula :","Coupeau, this time, broke out. Was he going to do his andouille much longer? When we told him that it was from a good heart! He would be doing them a favor there, he understood! Then, in a furious voice, he yelled:","Coupeau flamed out. Why did she not speak up, he should like to know? Instead of stammering and behaving like a fool?","Coupeau could no longer restrain himself. Was he going to continue making objections when they told him it was freely offered? He would be obliging them. There, did he understand? Then in an excited tone of voice he yelled:"
"Puis, d'une voix maternelle :","Then, in a motherly voice:","""You had best go and lie down,"" she said pleasantly.","Then in a maternal tone of voice she added, “Now go to bed, won’t you?"
Bijard eut un grognement d'animal qu'on dérange. Il bégaya :,Bijard grunted like an animal disturbed. He stammered:,"Bijard growled like an animal who is disturbed over his prey. ""Why do you meddle?"" he exclaimed.","Bijard growled like an animal being disturbed, and stuttered:"
"Coupeau se tourna, reprit le fer que Zidore lui tendait. Mais au moment où la concierge s'éloignait, elle aperçut sur l'autre trottoir Gervaise, tenant Nana par la main.","Coupeau turned and picked up the iron which Zidore held out to him. But just as the concierge was leaving, she saw Gervaise on the other sidewalk, holding Nana by the hand.",Coupeau turned and took the iron Zidore held out to him. At the same moment Mme Boche saw Gervaise coming toward her with little Nana trotting at her side.,"Coupeau turned round, and took back the iron that Zidore was holding for him. But just as the concierge was moving off, she caught sight of Gervaise on the other side of the way, holding Nana by the hand."
"Il lui mettait sous le nez un petit livre imprimé à Bruxelles : Les Amours de Napoléon III, orné de gravures. On y racontait, entre autres anecdotes, comment l'empereur avait séduit la fille d'un cuisinier, âgée de treize ans ; et l'image représentait Napoléon III, les jambes nues, ayant gardé seulement le grand cordon de la Légion d'honneur, poursuivant une gamine qui se dérobait à sa luxure.","He put before her a little book printed in Brussels: Les Amours de Napoleon III, decorated with engravings. It told, among other anecdotes, how the Emperor had seduced the thirteen-year-old daughter of a cook; and the image represented Napoleon III, bare-legged, having kept only the grand cordon of the Legion of Honor, pursuing a little girl who escaped his lust.","It was a scurrilous attack on the emperor, printed at Brussels, entitled The Amours of Napoleon III.","He thrust under his nose a little book printed at Brussels. “The Amours of Napoleon III.,” Illustrated with engravings. It related, among other anecdotes, how the Emperor had seduced a girl of thirteen, the daughter of a cook; and the picture represented Napoleon III. , bare-legged, and also wearing the grand ribbon of the Legion of Honor, pursuing a little girl who was trying to escape his lust."
"- Tiens ! cria-t-il, c'est la bande de la chaussée Clignancourt, déguisée en ours, avec des flafla ?",- Take ! he shouted.,"""Look!"" he said.","“Look!” cried he, “there’s the band of the Chaussee Clignancourt, disguised as bears with drums, putting on a show.”"
"Vrai ! Nana complétait à l'atelier une jolie éducation ! Oh ! elle avait des dispositions, bien sûr. Mais ça l'achevait, la fréquentation d'un tas de filles déjà éreintées de misère et de vice. On était là les unes sur les autres, on se pourrissait ensemble ; juste l'histoire des paniers de pommes, quand il y a des pommes gâtées. Sans doute, on se tenait devant la société, on évitait de paraître trop rosse de caractère, trop dégoûtante d'expressions. Enfin, on posait pour la demoiselle comme il faut. Seulement, à l'oreille, dans les coins, les saletés marchaient bon train. On ne pouvait pas se trouver deux ensemble, sans tout de suite se tordre de rire, en disant des cochonneries. Puis, on s'accompagnait le soir, c'était alors des confidences, des histoires à faire dresser les cheveux, qui attardaient sur les trottoirs les deux gamines, allumées au milieu des coudoiements de la foule. Et il y avait encore, pour les filles restées sages comme Nana, un mauvais air à l'atelier, l'odeur de bastringue et de nuits peu catholiques, apportée par les ouvrières coureuses, dans leurs chignons mal rattachés, dans leurs jupes si fripées qu'elles semblaient avoir couché avec. Les paresses molles des lendemains de noce, les yeux culottés, ce noir des yeux que madame Lerat appelait honnêtement les coups de poing de l'amour, les déhanchements, les voix enrouées, soufflaient une perversion au-dessus de l'établi, parmi l'éclat et la fragilité des fleurs artificielles. Nana reniflait, se grisait, lorsqu'elle sentait à côté d'elle une fille qui avait déjà vu le loup. Longtemps elle s'était mise auprès de la grande Lisa, qu'on disait grosse ; et elle coulait des regards luisants sur sa voisine, comme si elle s'était attendue à la voir enfler et éclater tout d'un coup. Pour apprendre du nouveau, ça paraissait difficile. La gredine savait tout, avait tout appris sur le pavé de la rue de la Goutte-d'Or. A l'atelier, simplement, elle voyait faire, il lui poussait peu à peu l'envie et le toupet de faire à son tour.","True ! Nana completed a fine education at the workshop! Oh ! she had a disposition, of course. But that was the end of it, hanging out with a bunch of girls already worn out with misery and vice. We were there on top of each other, we were rotting together; just the story of baskets of apples, when there are spoiled apples. Undoubtedly, we kept ourselves in front of society, we avoided appearing too rude in character, too disgusting in expression. Finally, we posed for the young lady as it should. Only, in the ear, in the corners, the dirt was going well. We couldn't be two together, without immediately bursting into laughter, saying junk. Then, we accompanied each other in the evening, it was then confidences, stories to make hair stand up, which lingered on the sidewalks the two girls, lit in the middle of the elbows of the crowd. And there was still, for the girls who had remained good like Nana, a bad air in the workshop, the smell of clubbing and un-Catholic nights, brought by the rushing workers, in their badly tied buns, in their wrinkled skirts. that they seemed to have slept with. The soft laziness of the day after the wedding, the cheeky eyes, that blackness of the eyes which Madame Lerat honestly called the punches of love, the swaying of the hips, the hoarse voices, breathed a perversion above the workbench, among the brilliance and fragility of artificial flowers. Nana sniffled, got drunk, when she felt beside her a girl who had already seen the wolf. For a long time she had sat beside tall Lisa, who was said to be fat; and she cast shining glances on her neighbour, as if she had expected to see her suddenly swell and burst. To learn something new, it seemed difficult. The rascal knew everything, had learned everything on the pavement of the rue de la Goutte-d'Or. In the workshop, she simply saw things done, little by little he gave her the desire and the nerve to do it in her turn.","Nana was certainly in a good school! Her instincts, to be sure, were vicious, but these instincts were fostered and developed in this place, as is too often the case when a crowd of girls are herded together. It was the story of a basket of apples, the good ones spoiled by those that were already rotten. If two girls were whispering in a corner, ten to one they were telling some story that could not be told aloud. Nana was not yet thoroughly perverted, but the curiosity which had been her distinguishing characteristic as a child had not deserted her, and she scarcely took her eyes from a girl by the name of Lisa, about whom strange stories were told.","As long as you avoided those you could say what you pleased. To tell the truth, Nana perfected her education in nice style in the workroom! No doubt she was already inclined to go wrong. But this was the finishing stroke—associating with a lot of girls who were already worn out with misery and vice. They all hobnobbed and rotted together, just the story of the baskets of apples when there are rotten ones among them. They maintained a certain propriety in public, but the smut flowed freely when they got to whispering together in a corner. For inexperienced girls like Nana, there was an undesirable atmosphere around the workshop, an air of cheap dance halls and unorthodox evenings brought in by some of the girls. The laziness of mornings after a gay night, the shadows under the eyes, the lounging, the hoarse voices, all spread an odor of dark perversion over the work-table which contrasted sharply with the brilliant fragility of the artificial flowers. Nana eagerly drank it all in and was dizzy with joy when she found herself beside a girl who had been around. She always wanted to sit next to big Lisa, who was said to be pregnant, and she kept glancing curiously at her neighbor as though expecting her to swell up suddenly."
"- Oui, n'est-ce pas ! ma biche, il y a là un cadet de notre connaissance. Faut pas me prendre pour un jobard ? Que je te pince à te balader encore, avec tes yeux en coulisse !","- Yes, isn't it! my deer, there is a younger acquaintance there. Shouldn't you take me for a jobard? Let me pinch you walking around again, with your eyes behind the scenes!","""There's a fellow I know, and you know him too!"" He then went on to accuse her, with many a coarse word, of coming out to look, not for him, but for her old lover, and then all at once he poured out a torrent of abuse upon Lantier, who, however, never looked up or appeared to hear it.","“Yes, my duck, there’s a young fellow of our acquaintance inside there! You mustn’t take me for a ninny. Don’t let me catch you gallivanting about again with your side glances!”"
"- A la vôtre, répondirent Boche et Poisson, qui trinquèrent avec lui.","""To yours,"" replied Boche and Poisson, who toasted with him.","Lantier was suddenly subdued and drank his wine, but Boche looked at Poisson uneasily.","replied Boche and Poisson, clinking glasses with him."
"- Il est allé acheter le déjeuner, il vous a dit de venir me chercher ici ?","- He went to buy lunch, he told you to pick me up here?","""He went to buy your breakfast, did he not? And he told you to come and look for me here, I suppose?""","“He’s gone to buy the lunch, and told you to come here to fetch me?”"
"- Après, reprit Gervaise, il faudrait encore un plat à la sauce.","- Afterwards, resumed Gervaise, we still need a dish with sauce.",Veal was always good too.,"“And after that,” resumed Gervaise, “we must have some other dish with a sauce.”"
"La voix de madame Lerat s'élevait, roucoulante et pleurarde, commençant un couplet :","Madame Lerat's voice rose, cooing and weeping, beginning a couplet:","Gervaise pressed her hands over her eyes; suddenly all was quiet, and she opened her eyes again and looked out.",The two men were chatting amiably together.
"- Allons, lève-toi, lui dit sa mère à voix basse. Je ne veux pas que tu restes. Elle se laissa couler du lit à regret, tournant la tête, ne quittant pas la morte du regard. Gervaise était fort embarrassée d'elle, ne sachant où la mettre, en attendant le jour. Elle se décidait à la faire habiller, lorsque Lantier, en pantalon et en pantoufles, vint la rejoindre ; il ne pouvait plus dormir, il avait un peu honte de sa conduite. Alors, tout s'arrangea.","- Come on, get up, his mother said to him in a low voice. I don't want you to stay. She let herself slip out of bed reluctantly, turning her head, not taking her eyes off the dead woman. Gervaise was very embarrassed about her, not knowing where to put her, while waiting for daylight. She was deciding to have her dressed when Lantier, in trousers and slippers, came to join her; he could no longer sleep, he was a little ashamed of his conduct. So everything worked out.","""Get up!"" said her mother in a low voice. ""I do not wish you to stay here."" The child slipped from her bed slowly and regretfully, with her eyes fixed on the dead body of her grandmother. Gervaise did not know what to do with her or where to send her. At this moment Lantier appeared at the door.","“Come, get up,” said her mother in a low voice. “You can’t remain here.” She regretfully slid out of bed, turning her head round and not taking her eyes off the corpse. Gervaise was much worried about her, not knowing where to put her till day-time. She was about to tell her to dress herself, when Lantier, in his trousers and slippers, rejoined her. He could not get to sleep again, and was rather ashamed of his behavior. Then everything was arranged."
"- Qui donc ? demanda Clémence, en interrompant sa conversation avec maman Coupeau et madame Putois.","- Who ? asked Clemence, interrupting her conversation with Maman Coupeau and Madame Putois.","""Who is separated?"" asked Clémence, interrupting her conversation with Mamma Coupeau.","Gervaise exclaimed. “Who are you talking about?” Clemence asked, interrupting her conversation with mother Coupeau and Madame Putois."
"Jamais Gervaise n'avait encore montré tant de complaisance. Elle était douce comme un mouton, bonne comme du pain. A part madame Lorilleux, qu'elle appelait Queue-de-Vache, pour se venger, elle ne détestait personne, elle excusait tout le monde. Dans le léger abandon de sa gueulardise, quand elle avait bien déjeuné et pris son café, elle cédait au besoin d'une indulgence générale. Son mot était : « On doit se pardonner entre soi, n'est-ce pas ? si l'on ne veut pas vivre comme des sauvages. » Quand on lui parlait de sa bonté, elle riait. Il n'aurait plus manqué qu'elle fût méchante ! Elle se défendait, elle disait n'avoir aucun mérite à être bonne. Est-ce que tous ses rêves n'étaient pas réalisés, est-ce qu'il lui restait à ambitionner quelque chose dans l'existence ? Elle rappelait son idéal d'autrefois, lorsqu'elle se trouvait sur le pavé travailler, manger du pain, avoir un trou à soi, élever ses enfants, ne pas être battue, mourir dans son lit. Et maintenant son idéal était dépassé ; elle avait tout, et en plus beau. Quant à mourir dans son lit, ajoutait-elle en plaisantant, elle y comptait, mais le plus tard possible, bien entendu.","Never before had Gervaise shown so much complaisance. She was sweet as a sheep, good as bread. Apart from Madame Lorilleux, whom she called Queue-de-Vache in revenge, she hated no one, she excused everyone. In the slight abandonment of her shouting, when she had had a good lunch and had her coffee, she yielded to the need for general indulgence. His word was, ""We have to forgive each other, don't we?"" if you don't want to live like savages. When people spoke to her of her kindness, she laughed. It would no longer have failed that she was wicked! She defended herself, she said she had no merit in being good. Were all his dreams not realized, did he still have something to strive for in existence? She recalled her ideal of the past, when she found herself on the pavement working, eating bread, having a hole of her own, bringing up her children, not being beaten, dying in her bed. And now his ideal was exceeded; she had everything, and more beautiful. As for dying in her bed, she added jokingly, she counted on it, but as late as possible, of course.","But hers was not turned; she was gentle and sweet and hated no one except her sister-in-law. She judged everybody kindly, particularly after she had eaten a good breakfast. When people called her good she laughed. Why should she not be good? She had seen all her dreams realized. She remembered what she once said—that she wanted to work hard, have plenty to eat, a home to herself, where she could bring up her children, not be beaten and die in her bed! As to dying in her bed, she added she wanted that still, but she would put it off as long as possible, ""if you please!","Gervaise was always so amiable, meek as a lamb, sweet as sugar. There wasn’t any one she disliked except Madame Lorilleux. While she was enjoying a good meal and coffee, she could be indulgent and forgive everybody saying: “We have to forgive each other—don’t we?—unless we want to live like savages.” Hadn’t all her dreams come true? She remembered her old dream: to have a job, enough bread to eat and a corner in which to sleep, to bring up her children, not to be beaten, and to die in her own bed. She had everything she wanted now and more than she had ever expected. She laughed, thinking of delaying dying in her own bed as long as possible."
"- Comme vous me tourmentez ! murmura-t-elle. Vous le voulez ? eh bien, oui ? Mon Dieu, nous faisons là une grande folie, peut-être.","- How you torment me! she whispered. You want it ? well yes ? My God, we are doing a great madness here, perhaps.","""How you tease,"" she replied. ""You wish it—well then, yes. Heaven grant that the day will not come when you will be sorry for it.""","“How you worry me!” she murmured. “You wish it? Well then, ‘yes.’ Ah! we’re perhaps doing a very foolish thing.”"
"Un soir, madame Lorilleux eut la méchanceté de lui demander brusquement :","One evening, Madame Lorilleux had the wickedness to ask him abruptly:",One evening Mme Lorilleux was malicious enough to say:,One evening Madame Lorilleux had the spitefulness to ask Gervaise suddenly:
"Du coup, le zingueur rigola. Il affectait de prendre la chose en blague, il la poussait, sans en avoir l'air. Par exemple, c'était une riche idée ! Le soir, aux lumières, elle pouvait encore faire des conquêtes. Si elle levait un homme, il lui recommandait le restaurant du Capucin, où il y avait des petits cabinets dans lesquels on mangeait parfaitement. Et, comme elle s'en allait sur le boulevard extérieur, blême et farouche, il lui cria encore :","Suddenly, the zinc worker laughed. He affected to take the thing as a joke, he pushed it, without seeming to. For example, it was a great idea! In the evening, under the lights, she could still make conquests. If she picked up a man, he would recommend the Capucin restaurant, where there were little cabinets in which one ate perfectly. And as she was going along the outer boulevard, pale and fierce, he called out to her again:","Coupeau pretended to consider this an excellent joke. Yes of course she could make a conquest; by gaslight she was still passably goodlooking. If she succeeded he advised her to dine at the Capucin, where there was very good eating. She turned away with livid lips; he called after her:","The zinc-worker laughed at this. He pretended to make a joke of the matter, and strengthened her purpose without seeming to do so. That was a fine idea of hers, and no mistake! In the evening, by gaslight, she might still hook a man. He recommended her to try the Capuchin restaurant where one could dine very pleasantly in a small private room. And, as she went off along the Boulevard, looking pale and furious he called out to her: “"
"- Oui, c'est nous ! gueulait-il. Hein ! tu ne t'attendais pas ? Ah ! c'est ici qu'on te pince, et avec un blanc-bec qui m'a manqué de respect tout à l'heure !","- Yes, it's us! he yelled. Eh ! weren't you expecting? Ah! this is where they pinch you, and with a greenhorn who was disrespectful to me just now!",Coupeau discovered that his daughter's partner was the young man for whom he had been looking. Gervaise pushed him aside and walked up to Nana and gave her two cuffs on her ears.,"“Yes, it’s us,” he roared. “Eh? You didn’t expect it. So we catch you here, and with a whipper-snapper, too, who insulted me a little while ago!”"
"- Leur loi du 31 mai est une abomination. Maintenant, il faut deux ans de domicile. Trois millions de citoyens sont rayés des listes ? On m'a dit que Bonaparte, au fond, est très vexé, car il aime le peuple, il en a donné des preuves.","- Their law of May 31 is an abomination. Now it takes two years of home. Three million citizens are removed from the lists? I have been told that Bonaparte, deep down, is very upset, because he loves the people, he has given proof of it.","Madinier talked politics. He was a Republican, and Bibi-la-Grillade and himself were soon in a hot discussion.","“Their law of May 31, is an abominable one. Now you must reside in a place for two years. Three millions of citizens are struck off the voting lists. I’ve been told that Bonaparte is, in reality, very much annoyed for he loves the people; he has given them proofs.”"
"- Eh bien, nous partons, dit-il. Nous vous laissons travailler.","- Well, we're leaving, he said. We let you work.","""We are going,"" he said coldly, ""We do not care to interrupt your work any longer.""","“Well, we’re off,” said he. “We mustn’t keep you from your work.”"
"Cinq ouvriers entrèrent, se tinrent debout.","Five workmen came in, stood up.","Five workmen went in, and the same voice said:",Five laborers came in and stood by the bar.
"- Vous êtes joliment dans le vrai, dit-il d'un air convaincu ; j'en ai encore emballé trois, aujourd'hui, qui m'auraient donné un fameux pourboire, si elles avaient pu envoyer la main à la poche ? Seulement, ma petite mère, ça ne peut pas s'arranger comme ça ?","- You are pretty much in the right, he said with an air of conviction; I packed three more today, who would have given me a famous tip, if they had been able to put their hands in their pockets? Only, my little mother, can't it be arranged like that?","I have buried three women today, who would each have given me a jolly little sum out of gratitude, if they could have put their hands in their pockets. But you see, my dear woman, it is not such an easy thing you are asking of me.""","“What you say is very true,” said he in a convinced manner. “I packed up three more to-day who would only have been too glad to have given me something for myself, could they but have got their hands to their pockets. But, little woman, it’s not so easily settled as all that—”"
- Je ne demande pas mieux que ça dure toujours.,- I do not ask better that it lasts forever.,"""And I hope for always,"" answered her sister-in-law severely.",“I shall be only too happy if we’re so always.”

"Le samedi matin en s'habillant, Coupeau fut pris d'inquiétude, devant sa pièce de vingt sous. Il venait de songer que, par politesse, il lui faudrait offrir un verre de vin et une tranche de jambon aux témoins, en attendant le dîner. Puis, il y aurait peut-être des frais imprévus. Décidément, vingt sous, ça ne suffisait pas. Alors, après s'être chargé de conduire Claude et Etienne chez madame Boche, qui devait les amener le soir au dîner, il courut rue de la Goutte-d'Or et monta carrément emprunter dix francs à Lorilleux. Par exemple, ça lui écorchait le gosier, car il s'attendait à la grimace de son beau-frère. Celui-ci grogna, ricana d'un air de mauvaise bête, et finalement prêta les deux pièces de cent sous. Mais Coupeau entendit sa sœur qui disait entre ses dents que « ça commençait bien ».","On Saturday morning while getting dressed, Coupeau was seized with uneasiness in front of his twenty-sou piece. He had just thought that, out of politeness, he would have to offer a glass of wine and a slice of ham to the witnesses while waiting for dinner. Then there might be unforeseen costs. Decidedly, twenty sous was not enough. So, after taking responsibility for driving Claude and Etienne to Madame Boche, who was to take them to dinner in the evening, he ran to the rue de la Goutte-d'Or and went straight upstairs to borrow ten francs from Lorilleux. For example, it scratched his throat, because he was expecting his brother-in-law's grimace. The latter groaned, sneered with an air of an evil beast, and finally lent the two hundred-sou pieces. But Coupeau heard his sister say between her teeth that “it was starting well”.","Saturday morning, as he dressed, Coupeau thought with some anxiety of his scanty funds; he supposed he ought to offer a glass of wine and a slice of ham to his witnesses while waiting for dinner; unexpected expenses might arise; no, it was clear that twenty sous was not enough. He consequently, after taking Claude and Etienne to Mlle Boche, who promised to appear with them at dinner, ran to his brother-in-law and borrowed ten francs; he did it with reluctance, and the words stuck in his throat, for he half expected a refusal. Lorilleux grumbled and growled but finally lent the money. But Coupeau heard his sister mutter under her breath, ""That is a good beginning.""","Saturday morning, while getting dressed, Coupeau felt a qualm of uneasiness in view of the single franc in his pocket. He began to think that it was a matter of ordinary courtesy to offer a glass of wine and a slice of ham to the witnesses while awaiting dinner. Also, there might be unforeseen expenses. So, after taking Claude and Etienne to stay with Madame Boche, who was to bring them to the dinner later that afternoon, he hurried over to the Rue de la Goutte-d’Or to borrow ten francs from Lorilleux. Having to do that griped him immensely as he could guess the attitude his brother-in-law would take. The latter did grumble a bit, but ended by lending him two five-franc pieces. However, Coupeau overheard his sister muttering under her breath, “This is a fine beginning.”"
"- Non, non, pas à l'hôpital ! ? Nous demeurons rue Neuve de la Goutte-d'Or.","- No, no, not in the hospital! ? We live in rue Neuve de la Goutte-d'Or.","""No—no! Not to the hospital—to our own home.""","“No, no, not to the hospital! We live in the Rue Neuve de la Goutte-d’Or.”"
"- Oh ! mon bon, si j'étais le gouvernement, reprit le chapelier en affectant une brusque gravité, les choses iraient un peu mieux, je vous en flanque mon billet ? Ainsi, leur politique extérieure, vrai ! ça fait suer, depuis quelque temps. Moi, moi qui vous parle, si je connaissais seulement un journaliste, pour l'inspirer de mes idées ?","- Oh ! my good, if I were the government, continued the hatter, affecting a sudden gravity, things would go a little better, I'll give you my note? Thus, their foreign policy, true! It's been sweating for some time. Me, me speaking to you, if I only knew a journalist, to inspire him with my ideas?",After this she had only to rinse the floor after sweeping the dirty water into the gutter.,"“Oh, my dear fellow, if I were the Government,” rejoined the hatter, suddenly affecting an air of gravity, “things would go on rather better, I give you my word for it. Thus, their foreign policy—why, for some time past it has been enough to make a fellow sweat. If I—I who speak to you—only knew a journalist to inspire him with my ideas.”"
"Mais Poisson ne le laissa pas achever. Il mit la main sur son cœur, comme pour expliquer que tout restait là. Il n'allait pas moucharder des amis, bien sûr. Coupeau étant arrivé, on vida un second litre. Le sergent de ville fila ensuite par la cour, reprit sur le trottoir sa marche raide et sévère, à pas comptés.","But Poisson did not let him finish. He put his hand on his heart, as if to explain that everything stayed there. He wasn't going to snitch on friends, of course. Coupeau having arrived, a second liter was emptied. The sergent de ville then sped through the courtyard, resuming his stiff, severe walk on the sidewalk, with measured steps.","Poisson did not allow him to finish: he laid his hand on his heart and declared that he was no spy. Their words went in at one ear and out at another. He had forgotten them already. Coupeau by this time appeared, and more wine was sent for. But Poisson dared linger no longer, and, stiff and haughty, he departed through the courtyard.","But Poisson did not let him finish. He placed his hand upon his heart, as though to explain that all remained buried there. He certainly did not go spying about on his friends. Coupeau arriving, they emptied a second quart. Then the policeman went off by way of the courtyard and resumed his stiff and measured tread along the pavement."
"- Enfin, voilà, nous ne serions que tous les deux, reprit-il. Les autres me gênent, vous comprenez ? ? Quand j'ai de l'amitié pour une personne, je ne peux pas voir cette personne avec d'autres.","- Finally, here, we would only be the two of us, he resumed. The others annoy me, you understand? ? When I have friendship for a person, I cannot see this person with others.","""Yes,"" he said, ""we two would live all by ourselves."" But as her self-possession returned she refused with firmness.",“There would only be the two of us. It annoys me having others around.”
"Et ce, mot : la Banban, courut dans la société. Lorilleux ricanait, disait qu'il fallait l'appeler comme ça. Mais madame Fauconnier prenait la défense de Gervaise ; on avait tort de se moquer d'elle, elle était propre comme un sou et abattait fièrement l'ouvrage, quand il le fallait. Madame Lerat, toujours pleine d'allusions polissonnes, appelait la jambe de la petite « une quille d'amour » ; et elle ajoutait que beaucoup d'hommes aimaient ça, sans vouloir s'expliquer davantage.","And this, word: la Banban, ran through society. Lorilleux sneered, said he had to be called that. But Madame Fauconnier came to Gervaise's defense; it was wrong to make fun of her, she was clean as a penny and proudly put down the work, when necessary. Madame Lerat, always full of mischievous allusions, called the little girl's leg ""a keel of love""; and she added that many men liked it, without wanting to explain further.","This epithet was heard by Mme Fauconnier, who took up the cudgels for Gervaise who, she said, was as neat as a pin and worked like a tiger.","“Clump-clump” ran through the wedding procession. Lorilleux laughed under his breath, and said they ought to call her that, but Madame Fauconnier stood up for Gervaise. They shouldn’t make fun of her; she was neat as a pin and did a good job when there was washing to be done."
"Mais elle avait compris, elle se dégagea, éperdue, le tutoyant à son tour, comme jadis.","But she had understood, she freed herself, distraught, addressing him in her turn, as before.",But she understood him and drew hastily back.,"She understood what he meant and pulled her hand free. She sighed to herself, and, in her bewilderment, addressed him familiarly, as in the old days."
"- Non, bien sûr, répondit maman Coupeau. Lorsqu'ils vont entrer, je me placerai en face de la porte pour voir leur nez.","""No, of course not,"" replied Maman Coupeau. When they come in, I will stand in front of the door to see their noses.","""No indeed,"" answered the old woman, ""but I wish to see them when they first come in—just to see how they look!""","“No, that’s very certain,” replied mother Coupeau. “When they arrive I shall place myself so as to have a good view of the door to see the faces they’ll make.”"

"Ces dames soufflaient, en regardant d'un air de regret le saladier. Clémence raconta qu'elle avait un jour avalé trois bottes de cresson à son déjeuner. Madame Putois était plus forte encore, elle prenait des têtes de romaine sans les éplucher ; elle les broutait comme ça, à la croque-au-sel. Toutes auraient vécu de salade, s'en seraient payé des baquets. Et, cette conversation aidant, ces dames finirent le saladier.","These ladies huffed, looking regretfully at the bowl. Clemence said that she had one day swallowed three bunches of watercress at her lunch. Madame Putois was stronger still, she took romaine heads without peeling them; she nibbled on them like that, a la croque-au-sel. All would have lived on lettuce, would have paid bucketfuls of it. And, this conversation helping, the ladies finished the bowl.","Mme Putois declared that she enjoyed lettuce with a pinch of salt and no dressing, and as they talked the ladies emptied the salad bowl.","The ladies sighed as they looked regretfully at the salad-bowl. Clemence related that she had one day eaten three bunches of watercresses at her lunch. Madame Putois could do more than that, she would take a coss lettuce and munch it up with some salt just as it was without separating the leaves. They could all have lived on salad, would have treated themselves to tubfuls. And, this conversation aiding, the ladies cleaned out the salad-bowl."
"Gervaise s'était prêtée à ce jeu ; et, quand elle lui lâcha le bras, les camarades trouvèrent la blague si bonne, qu'ils se jetèrent les uns sur les autres, braillant et se frottant les épaules comme des ânes qu'on étrille. Le zingueur avait la bouche fendue par un tel rire, qu'on lui voyait jusqu'au gosier.","Gervaise had lent herself to this game; and when she let go of his arm, the comrades thought the joke so good that they threw themselves on each other, bawling and rubbing their shoulders like donkeys being groomed. The zinc worker's mouth was split with such laughter that you could see him down to his throat.","Gervaise saw she could not stand there among all those men, so she accepted the offered chair.","Gervaise had humored him at this game, and when she let go of his arm, the comrades thought the joke so good that they tumbled up against one another, braying and rubbing their shoulders like donkeys being groomed. The zinc-worker’s mouth was so wide with laughter that you could see right down his throat."
"- Allons ! le bourgeois n'est pas sage, n'est-ce pas ? ? Ne vous désolez pas, madame Lantier. Il s'occupe beaucoup de politique ; l'autre jour, quand on a voté pour Eugène Sue, un bon, paraît-il, il était comme un fou. Peut-être bien qu'il a passé la nuit avec des amis à dire du mal de cette crapule de Bonaparte.","- Let's go ! the bourgeois is not wise, is he? ? Don't be upset, Madame Lantier. He deals a lot with politics; the other day, when we voted for Eugene Sue, a good one, it seems, he was like a madman. Maybe he spent the night with friends talking badly about that scoundrel Bonaparte.","""You think your husband ought to have been with you, madame. But don't be troubled; he is busy with politics. He went on like a mad man the other day when they were voting for Eugene Sue. Perhaps he passed the night with his friends abusing that reprobate Bonaparte.""","“Come, the old man’s not been home, has he? Don’t worry yourself, Madame Lantier. He’s very much occupied with politics. When they were voting for Eugene Sue the other day, he was acting almost crazy. He has very likely spent the night with some friends blackguarding crapulous Bonaparte.”"
"- Tiens ! la grande Virginie ! ? Qu'est-ce qu'elle vient laver ici, celle-là, avec ses quatre guenilles dans un mouchoir ?","- Take ! great Virginia! ? What does she come to wash here, that one, with her four rags in a handkerchief?","""Look! There comes big Virginie! She is actually coming here to wash her rags tied up in a handkerchief.""","“Why, there’s tall Virginie! What has she come here to wash, when all her wardrobe that isn’t on her would go into a pocket handkerchief?”"
"Quand Gervaise mit le pied dans l'allée de l'hôtel Boncœur, les larmes la reprirent. C'était une allée noire, étroite, avec un ruisseau longeant le mur, pour les eaux sales ; et cette puanteur qu'elle retrouvait lui faisait songer aux quinze jours passés là avec Lantier, quinze jours de misère et de querelles, dont le souvenir, à cette heure, était un regret cuisant. Il lui sembla entrer dans son abandon.","When Gervaise set foot in the driveway of the Hotel Boncoeur, tears seized her again. It was a dark, narrow alley, with a stream running along the wall, for dirty water; and the stench she found again made her think of the fortnight spent there with Lantier, fifteen days of misery and quarrels, the memory of which, at this hour, was a burning regret. He seemed to enter into his abandonment.","When Gervaise entered the alley which led to the Hôtel Boncoeur her tears choked her. It was a long, dark, narrow alley, with a gutter on one side close to the wall, and the loathsome smell brought to her mind the recollection of having passed through there with Lantier a fortnight previous. And what had that fortnight been? A succession of quarrels and dissensions, the remembrance of which would be forevermore a regret and bitterness.","When Gervaise turned into the entry of the Hotel Boncoeur, her tears again mastered her. It was a dark, narrow passage, with a gutter for the dirty water running alongside the wall; and the stench which she again encountered there caused her to think of the fortnight she had passed in the place with Lantier—a fortnight of misery and quarrels, the recollection of which was now a bitter regret. It seemed to bring her abandonment home to her."
"Mais on ne l'écoutait pas, on parlait d'appeler le monsieur pour rallumer le feu de madame Lerat.","But they weren't listening to him, they were talking about calling the gentleman to rekindle Madame Lerat's fire.",Nana listened to the conversation which followed—reveling in indecency—as much at home in it as a fish is in water.,"They refused to listen to any explanation, but maintained they were going to call in the gentleman outside to rekindle Madame Lerat’s fire."
"Il piétina un instant, il attendit, espérant un mot, une allusion quelconque. Enfin, il se décida à entamer les choses lui-même.","He stamped for a moment, he waited, hoping for a word, some hint. Finally, he decided to start things himself.","He lingered a moment, hoping for a word or an allusion. Suddenly he decided to begin the subject himself.","He moved about for a moment, waiting, hoping for a word or some allusion or other. At length he decided to broach the subject himself."
"- Ah ! mon Dieu ! mon Dieu ! jamais ça ne devait être, jamais ! Vous aviez juré. Et ça est, maintenant, ça est ! ? Ah ! mon Dieu ! ça me fait trop de mal, allez-vous-en !","- Oh! my God ! my God ! it was never meant to be, never! You had sworn. And it is, now it is! ? Ah! my God ! It hurts me too much, go away!","""Are you ill?"" she said nervously. ""No, not ill,"" he answered, ""but sick at heart. Sick when I remember what you said and see the truth. Leave me. I cannot bear to look at you.""","“Mon Dieu! Ah! Mon Dieu! It was never to be—never. You swore it. And now it is—it is! Ah, it pains me too much, leave me!”"
"- Maman ! maman ! s'écria brusquement Nana, c'est Augustine qui laisse tomber son pain dans la rôtissoire !","- Mom ! mom ! exclaimed Nana abruptly, it's Augustine dropping her bread into the roasting pan!","Etienne, Nana, Pauline and little Victor Fauconnier were installed at a small table and were told to be very good. When the blanquette du veau was served the guests were moved to enthusiasm.","“Mamma! Mamma!” suddenly screamed Nana, “Augustine is dipping her bread in the Dutch oven!”"
"Il était à peine onze heures. Sur le boulevard de la Chapelle, et dans tout le quartier de la Goutte-d'Or, la paye de grande quinzaine, qui tombait ce samedi-là, mettait un vacarme énorme de soûlerie. Madame Lorilleux attendait à vingt pas du Moulin-d'Argent, debout sous un bec de gaz.","It was barely eleven o'clock. On the Boulevard de la Chapelle and throughout the Goutte-d'Or quarter, the fortnight's pay, which fell that Saturday, caused an enormous drunken uproar.

"En nous en r'tournant,","By returning to us,","The guests within were all more or less tipsy, and there was so much noise that the policemen ran to quell a riot, but when they saw Poisson they bowed respectfully and passed on.","The young un’s almost wild,"
"- Vous ne nous gêneriez pas, bien sûr, finit-elle par dire. Il y aurait moyen de s'organiser ?","- You wouldn't bother us, of course, she finally said. Is there a way to organize?","""If we could arrange it I am sure—"" said Gervaise hesitatingly.","“You would certainly not be in our way,” Gervaise ended by saying. “We could so arrange things—”"
"- Je sors, je vais louer ma boutique.","- I'm going out, I'm going to rent my shop.","She did not withdraw all her savings from the bank at once, for she had a vague hope that some miracle would intervene which would render the sacrifice unnecessary.",“I’m going out; I’m going to rent my shop.”
"Gervaise s'était prise d'une grande amitié pour sa voisine. Elle la traitait en égale, en femme d'âge, qui connaît l'existence. Il faut dire que Lalie avait une mine pâle et sérieuse, avec une expression de vieille fille. On lui aurait donné trente ans, quand on l'entendait causer. Elle savait très bien acheter, raccommoder, tenir son chez elle, et elle parlait des enfants comme si elle avait eu déjà deux ou trois couches dans sa vie. A huit ans, cela faisait sourire les gens de l'entendre ; puis, on avait la gorge serrée, on s'en allait pour ne pas pleurer. Gervaise l'attirait le plus possible, lui donnait tout ce qu'elle pouvait, du manger, des vieilles robes. Un jour, comme elle lui essayait un ancien caraco à Nana, elle était restée suffoquée, en lui voyant l'échine bleue, le coude écorché et saignant encore, toute sa chair d'innocente martyrisée et collée aux os. Eh bien ! le père Bazouge pouvait apprêter sa boîte, elle n'irait pas loin de ce train-là ! Mais la petite avait prié la blanchisseuse de ne rien dire. Elle ne voulait pas qu'on embêtât son père à cause d'elle. Elle le défendait, assurait qu'il n'aurait pas été méchant, s'il n'avait pas bu. Il était fou, il ne savait plus. Oh ! elle lui pardonnait, parce qu'on doit tout pardonner aux fous.","Gervaise had developed a great friendship for her neighbour. She treated her as an equal, as a middle-aged woman who knows about existence. It must be said that Lalie looked pale and serious, with an old maid's expression. You would have thought he was thirty when you heard him talking. She knew very well how to buy, mend, keep her home, and she spoke of children as if she had already had two or three babies in her life. At eight years old, it made people smile to hear it; then, we had a lump in our throats, we were going away so as not to cry. Gervaise attracted her as much as possible, gave her everything she could, food, old dresses. One day, as she was trying on an old Nana camisole, she was choked to see his spine blue, his elbow scraped and still bleeding, all his innocent flesh martyred and stuck to the bones. Well ! Father Bazouge could get his box ready, it wouldn't go far from that! But the child had begged the laundress not to say anything. She didn't want her father to be bothered because of her. She defended him, assured him that he wouldn't have been mean if he hadn't been drinking. He was crazy, he no longer knew. Oh ! she forgave him, because one must forgive the mad for everything.","Gervaise had conceived a strong affection for this little neighbor. She treated her like a woman who knew something of life. It must be admitted that Lalie was large for her years. She was fair and pale, with solemn eyes for her years and had a delicate mouth. To have heard her talk one would have thought her thirty. She could make and mend, and she talked of the children as if she had herself brought them into the world. She made people laugh sometimes when she talked, but more often she brought tears to their eyes. Gervaise did everything she could for her, gave her what she could and helped the energetic little soul with her work. One day she was altering a dress of Nana's for her, and when the child tried it on Gervaise was chilled with horror at seeing her whole back purple and bruised, the tiny arm bleeding—all the innocent flesh of childhood martyrized by the brute—her father. Bazonge might get the coffin ready, she thought, for the little girl could not bear this long. But Lalie entreated her friend to say nothing, telling her that her father did not know what he was doing, that he had been drinking. She forgave him with her whole heart, for madmen must not be held accountable for their deeds.","Gervaise entertained a great friendship for her little neighbor. She treated her as an equal, as a grown-up woman of experience. It must be said that Lalie had a pale and serious look, with the expression of an old girl. One might have thought her thirty on hearing her speak. She knew very well how to buy things, mend the clothes, attend to the home, and she spoke of the children as though she had already gone through two or thee nurseries in her time. It made people smile to hear her talk thus at eight years old; and then a lump would rise in their throats, and they would hurry away so as not to burst out crying. Gervaise drew the child towards her as much as she could, gave her all she could spare of food and old clothing. One day as she tried one of Nana’s old dresses on her, she almost choked with anger on seeing her back covered with bruises, the skin off her elbow, which was still bleeding, and all her innocent flesh martyred and sticking to her bones. Well! Old Bazouge could get a box ready; she would not last long at that rate! But the child had begged the laundress not to say a word. She would not have her father bothered on her account. She took his part, affirming that he would not have been so wicked if it had not been for the drink. He was mad, he did not know what he did. Oh! she forgave him, because one ought to forgive madmen everything."
"Alors, on ricana devant le dessert. Ça ne comptait pas, le dessert. Il arrivait un peu tard, mais ça ne faisait rien, on allait tout de même le caresser. Quand on aurait dû éclater comme des bombes, on ne pouvait pas se laisser embêter par des fraises et du gâteau. D'ailleurs, rien ne pressait, on avait le temps, la nuit entière si l'on voulait. En attendant, on emplit les assiettes de fraises et de fromage blanc. Les hommes allumaient les pipes ; et, comme les bouteilles cachetées étaient vides, ils revenaient aux litres, ils buvaient du vin en fumant. Mais on voulut que Gervaise coupât tout de suite le gâteau de Savoie. Poisson, très galant, se leva pour prendre la rose, qu'il offrit à la patronne, aux applaudissements de la société. Elle dut l'attacher avec une épingle, sur le sein gauche, du côté du cœur. A chacun de ses mouvements, le papillon voltigeait.","So we laughed at the dessert. Dessert didn't count. He arrived a little late, but that didn't matter, we were going to pet him all the same. When we should have burst like bombs, we couldn't be bothered with strawberries and cake. Besides, there was no hurry, we had time, the whole night if we wanted. In the meantime, we fill the plates with strawberries and fromage blanc. The men lit the pipes; and, as the sealed bottles were empty, they went back to liters, they drank wine while smoking. But they wanted Gervaise to cut the Savoy cake right away. Poisson, very gallant, rose to take the rose, which he offered to the landlady, to the applause of the company. She had to tie it with a pin, on the left breast, on the side of the heart. With each of its movements, the butterfly fluttered.","None of the guests were dismayed at the dessert, although they had eaten so enormously. They had the night before them too; there was no need of haste. The men lit their pipes and drank more wine while they watched Gervaise cut the cake. Poisson, who prided himself on his knowledge of the habits of good society, rose and took the rose from the top and presented it to the hostess amid the loud applause of the whole party. She fastened it just over her heart, and the butterfly fluttered at every movement.","Then they chuckled together as they eyed the dessert. Dessert did not count. It came rather late but that did not matter; they would nurse it all the same. When you’re that stuffed, you can’t let yourself be stopped by strawberries and cake. There was no hurry. They had the entire night if they wished. So they piled their plates with strawberries and cream cheese. Meanwhile the men lit their pipes. They were drinking the ordinary wine while they smoked since the special wine had been finished. Now they insisted that Gervaise cut the Savoy cake. Poisson got up and took the rose from the cake and presented it in his most gallant manner to the hostess amidst applause from the other guests. She pinned it over her left breast, near the heart. The silver butterfly fluttered with her every movement."
"Mais une main brutale poussa la porte, le père Bijard entra. Alors, la scène changea, Henriette et Jules tombèrent sur leur derrière, contre le mur ; tandis que Lalie, terrifiée, restait au beau milieu d'une révérence. Le serrurier tenait un grand fouet de charretier tout neuf, à long manche de bois blanc, à lanière de cuir terminée par un bout de ficelle mince. Il posa ce fouet dans le coin du lit, il n'allongea pas son coup de soulier habituel à la petite, qui se garait déjà en présentant les reins. Un ricanement montrait ses dents noires, et il était très gai, très soûl, la trogne allumée d'une idée de rigolade.","But a brutal hand pushed open the door, Father Bijard entered. Then the scene changed, Henriette and Jules fell on their behinds, against the wall; while Lalie, terrified, remained in the middle of a bow. The locksmith held a large, brand-new carter's whip, with a long white wooden handle, a leather strap ending in a thin piece of string. He put this whip in the corner of the bed, he didn't extend his usual kick to the little one, who was already pulling over, presenting her loins. A sneer showed his black teeth, and he was very gay, very drunk, his face kindled with the idea of laughing.","""Come in, Mr Wind!"" she repeated, but the door was pushed open by a rough hand and Bijard entered. Then a sudden change came over the scene. The two children crouched in a corner, while Lalie stood in the center of the floor, frozen stiff with terror, for Bijard held in his hand a new whip with a long and wicked-looking lash. He laid this whip on the bed and did not kick either one of the children but smiled in the most vicious way, showing his two lines of blackened, irregular teeth. He was very drunk and very noisy.","But a rough hand pushed open the door, and Bijard entered. Then the scene changed. Henriette and Jules fell down flat against the wall; whilst Lalie, terrified, remained standing in the very middle of the curtsey. The locksmith held in his hand a big waggoner’s whip, quite new, with a long white wooden handle, and a leather thong, terminating with a bit of whip-cord. He placed the whip in the corner against the bed and did not give the usual kick to the child who was already preparing herself by presenting her back. A chuckle exposed his blackened teeth and he was very lively, very drunk, his red face lighted up by some idea that amused him immensely."
"Gervaise resta toute pâle, les mains tremblantes, tournant sans savoir ce qu'elle faisait, pendant que Nana, aplatie sur la gorge, serrant son oreiller entre ses bras, retombait dans l'engourdissement de son sommeil de plomb..","Gervaise remained very pale, her hands trembling, turning around without knowing what she was doing, while Nana, flattened on her throat, clutching her pillow in her arms, fell back into the numbness of her leaden sleep.","Gervaise turned away pale and trembling, while Nana composed herself to sleep again.","Gervaise remained pale, with trembling hands, turning round without knowing what she was about, whilst Nana, flattened on her breast, embraced her pillow with both arms and subsided into the torpor of her leaden slumber."
"- Hé ! Zidore, mets les fers ! cria Coupeau.","- Hey ! Zidore, put the irons on! cried Coupeau.","""Put in the irons, Zidore!"" shouted Coupeau.","“Hi! Zidore, put in the irons!” cried Coupeau."
"Ah ! pour le coup, les Lorilleux ne la retinrent pas ! Bon voyage, du diable s'ils lui ouvraient encore ! Ils avaient assez vu sa figure, ils ne voulaient pas chez eux de la misère des autres, quand cette misère était méritée. Et ils se laissèrent aller à une grosse jouissance d'égoïsme, en se trouvant calés, bien au chaud, avec la perspective d'une fameuse soupe. Boche aussi s'étalait, enflant encore ses joues, si bien que son rire devenait malpropre. Ils se trouvaient tous joliment vengés des anciennes manières de la Banban, de la boutique bleue, des gueuletons, et du reste. C'était trop réussi, ça prouvait où conduisait l'amour de la frigousse. Au rancart les gourmandes, les paresseuses et les dévergondées !","Ah! for once, the Lorilleuxs did not retain her! Have a good trip, damn if they opened it again! They had seen enough of his face, they did not want the misery of others in their homes, when this misery was deserved. And they let themselves go to a great enjoyment of selfishness, finding themselves propped up, warm, with the prospect of a famous soup. Boche was also smearing, puffing out his cheeks again, so much so that his laughter became dirty. They were all nicely avenged for the old ways of the Banban, the blue shop, the gueuletons, and the rest. It was too successful, it proved where the love of the fridge led. Away with the greedy, the lazy and the wanton!","And she went away; the warmth of the place and the smell of the soup were unbearable. The Lorilleuxs shrugged their shoulders as the door closed. They hoped they had seen the last of her face. She had brought all her misfortunes on her own head, and she had, therefore, no right to expect any assistance from them. Boche joined in these animadversions, and all three considered themselves avenged for the blue shop and all the rest.","Ah! the Lorilleuxs did not detain her. Good riddance; just see if they opened the door to her again. They had seen enough of her face. They didn’t want other people’s misery in their rooms, especially when that misery was so well deserved. They reveled in their selfish delight at being seated so cozily in a warm room, with a dainty soup cooking. Boche also stretched himself, puffing with his cheeks still more and more, so much, indeed, that his laugh really became indecent. They were all nicely revenged on Clump-clump, for her former manners, her blue shop, her spreads, and all the rest. It had all worked out just as it should, proving where a love of showing-off would get you."
"Puis, madame Lorilleux eut l'idée de demander si l'on apercevait, sur le boulevard de la Chapelle, le marchand de vin où l'on allait manger, au Moulin-d'Argent. Alors, pendant dix minutes, on chercha, on se disputa même ; chacun plaçait le marchand de vin à un endroit. Paris, autour d'eux, étendait son immensité grise, aux lointains bleuâtres, ses vallées profondes, où roulait une houle de toitures ; toute la rive droite était dans l'ombre, sous un grand haillon de nuage cuivré ; et, du bord de ce nuage, frangé d'or, un large rayon coulait, qui allumait les milliers de vitres de la rive gauche d'un pétillement d'étincelles, détachant en lumière ce coin de la ville sur un ciel très pur, lavé par l'orage.","Then Madame Lorilleux had the idea of asking if they saw, on the Boulevard de la Chapelle, the wine merchant where they were going to eat at the Moulin-d'Argent. So, for ten minutes, we searched, we even argued; each placed the wine merchant in one place. Paris, around them, extended its gray immensity, to the bluish distances, its deep valleys, where rolled a swell of roofs; the whole right bank was in shadow, under a great rag of coppery cloud; and, from the edge of this cloud, fringed with gold, a wide ray streamed, which lit up the thousands of panes of the left bank with a sparkling of sparks, setting this corner of the city in light against a very pure sky, washed away by the storm.","Madinier again constituted himself master of ceremonies and pointed out all the monuments, but Mme Fauconnier would not put her foot outside the little door; she would not look down on that pavement for all the world, she said, and the party soon tired of this amusement and descended the stairs.","Madame Lorilleux asked if they could see the place where they were to have dinner, the Silver Windmill on the Boulevard de la Chapelle. For ten minutes they tried to see it, even arguing about it. Everyone had their own idea where it was."
On vida les verres. Lantier se mit à lire tout haut :,We emptied the glasses. Lantier began to read aloud:,"Lantier did not reply instantly, but presently, as the others emptied their glasses, he began to read aloud an account of a frightful murder, to which they listened with eager interest.",They emptied their glasses. Then Lantier read out loud:
"- Il a sauté du lit, il a mis toutes les affaires dans la malle, il est parti ?","- He jumped out of bed, he put all the things in the trunk, he left?","""He jumped off the bed, put his things in the trunk, and he went away.""","He jumped off the bed, he put all the things in the trunk. He’s gone away.”"
"On commanda deux nouveaux litres. Les verres ne désemplissaient plus, la soûlerie montait. Vers cinq heures, ça commençait à devenir dégoûtant, si bien que Lantier se taisait et songeait à filer ; du moment où l'on gueulait et où l'on fichait le vin par terre, ce n'était plus son genre. Justement, Coupeau se leva pour faire le signe de croix des pochards. Sur la tête il prononça Montpernasse, à l'épaule droite Menilmonte, à l'épaule gauche la Courtille, au milieu du ventre Bagnolet, et dans le creux de l'estomac trois fois Lapin sauté. Alors, le chapelier, profitant de la clameur soulevée par cet exercice, prit tranquillement la porte. Les camarades ne s'aperçurent même pas de son départ. Lui, avait déjà un joli coup de sirop. Mais, dehors, il se secoua, il retrouva son aplomb ; et il regagna tranquillement la boutique, où il raconta à Gervaise que Coupeau était avec des amis.","Two new liters were ordered. The glasses were always full, the drunkenness mounted. Around five o'clock it was beginning to become disgusting, so much so that Lantier was silent and thought of slipping away; the moment we yelled and shoved the wine on the floor, it was no longer his style. Precisely, Coupeau got up to make the sign of the cross of the drunks. On the head he pronounced Montpernasse, on the right shoulder Menilmonte, on the left shoulder La Courtille, in the middle of the belly Bagnolet, and in the pit of the stomach three times Lapin sauté. Then the hatter, taking advantage of the clamor aroused by this exercise, quietly went to the door. The comrades did not even notice his departure. He already had a nice shot of syrup. But, outside, he shook himself, he regained his composure; and he quietly returned to the shop, where he told Gervaise that Coupeau was with some friends.","By this time the wine was exhausted, and they called for more. About five all except Lantier were in a state of beastly intoxication, and he found them so disgusting that , as usual, he made his escape without his comrades noticing his defection. Lantier walked about a little and then, when he felt all right, went home and told Gervaise that her husband was with his friends.","They ordered two fresh bottles. The glasses were filled up again as fast as they were emptied, the booze increased. Towards five o’clock it began to get disgusting, so much so that Lantier kept very quiet, thinking of how to give the others the slip; brawling and throwing the wine about was no longer his style. Just then Coupeau stood up to make the drunkard’s sign of the cross. Touching his head he pronounced Montpernasse, then Menilmonte as he brought his hand to his right shoulder, Bagnolet giving himself a blow in the chest, and wound up by saying stewed rabbit three times as he hit himself in the pit of the stomach. Then the hatter took advantage of the clamor which greeted the performance of this feat and quietly made for the door. His comrades did not even notice his departure. He had already had a pretty good dose. But once outside he shook himself and regained his self-possession; and he quietly made for the shop, where he told Gervaise that Coupeau was with some friends."
"- Vous ne savez pas ? cria un jour madame Lorilleux dans la loge des Boche, où la coterie prenait du café, eh bien ! vrai comme la lumière du jour nous éclaire, c'est la Banban qui a vendu sa fille ? Oui, elle l'a vendue, et j'ai des preuves ! ? Ce vieux, qu'on rencontrait matin et soir dans l'escalier, il montait déjà donner des acomptes. Ça crevait les yeux. Et, hier donc ! quelqu'un les a aperçus ensemble à l'Ambigu, la donzelle et son matou ? Ma parole d'honneur ! ils sont ensemble, vous voyez bien !","- You do not know ? exclaimed Madame Lorilleux one day in the Boche box, where the coterie was having coffee, ""Well! true as the light of day enlightens us, it is the Banban who sold her daughter? Yes, she sold it, and I have proof! ? This old man, whom we met morning and evening on the stairs, was already going up to give installments. It was eye-catching. And so yesterday! has anyone seen them together at the Ambigu, the damsel and her cat? My word of honor! they are together, you see!","""You know nothing about it!"" cried Mme Lorilleux one evening when they were all assembled in the room of the concierge. "" Wooden Legs sold her daughter out and out. I know it! I have positive proof of what I say. The time that the old gentleman was seen on the stairs he was going to pay the money. Nana and he were seen together at the Ambigu the other night! I tell you, I know it!"" They finished their coffee.","“Do you know,” cried Madame Lorilleux, one day in the Boches’ room, where the party were taking coffee; “well, as sure as daylight, Clump-clump sold her daughter. Yes she sold her, and I have proof of it! That old fellow, who was always on the stairs morning and night, went up to pay something on account. It stares one in the face. They were seen together at the Ambigu Theatre—the young wench and her old tom cat. Upon my word of honor, they’re living together, it’s quite plain.”"
"Le dessert était servi. Au milieu, il y avait un gâteau de Savoie, en forme de temple, avec un dôme à côtes de melon ; et, sur le dôme, se trouvait plantée une rose artificielle, près de laquelle se balançait un papillon en papier d'argent, au bout d'un fil de fer. Deux gouttes de gomme, au cœur de la fleur, imitaient deux gouttes de rosée. Puis, à gauche, un morceau de fromage blanc nageait dans un plat creux tandis que, dans un autre plat, à droite, s'entassaient de grosses fraises meurtries dont le jus coulait. Pourtant, il restait de la salade, de larges feuilles de romaine trempées d'huile.","Dessert was served. In the middle, there was a cake of Savoy, in the shape of a temple, with a dome of melon ribs; and on the dome was planted an artificial rose, near which swung a silver paper butterfly on the end of a wire. Two drops of gum, at the heart of the flower, imitated two drops of dew. Then, on the left, a piece of fromage blanc floated in a hollow dish, while in another dish, on the right, were heaped large, bruised strawberries whose juice was flowing. However, there was still some lettuce, large leaves of romaine soaked in oil.","The dessert was served.

On the left was a deep plate with a bit of cheese, and on the other side of the pyramid was a dish of strawberries, which had been sugared and carefully crushed.

- Maman ! maman !,- Mom ! mom !,"But when Mamma Coupeau had gone a few steps Gervaise called her back into the shop and, taking her wedding ring from her finger, said:",“Mamma! Mamma!”
"- L'accoucheuse du bout de la rue et sa bonne, vous savez, une petite blonde ? Une gale, cette fille ! Elle criait à l'autre : « Oui, oui, t'as décroché un enfant à la fruitière, même que je vais aller chez le commissaire, si tu ne me payes pas. » Et elle en débagoulait, fallait voir ! L'accoucheuse, là-dessus, lui a lâché une baffe, v'lan ! en plein museau. Voilà alors que ma sacrée gouine saute aux yeux de sa bourgeoise, et qu'elle la graffigne, et qu'elle la déplume, oh ! mais aux petits oignons ! Il a fallu que le charcutier la lui retirât des pattes. Les ouvrières eurent un rire de complaisance. Puis, toutes burent une petite gorgée de café, d'un air gueulard.","- The midwife at the end of the street and her maid, you know, a little blonde? A scab, this girl! She shouted to the other: ""Yes, yes, you got a child at the fruit store, even that I'm going to go to the superintendent if you don't pay me."" And she was getting out of it, you had to see! The midwife, on top of that, gave him a slap, v'lan! right in the muzzle. That's when my sacred dyke jumps in the eyes of her bourgeoise, and she scratches her, and she plucks her feathers, oh! but with small onions! The butcher had to pull it from his legs. The workers gave a complacent laugh. Then they all drank a small sip of coffee, with a loud air.",Virginie suddenly stooped down to her hostess and said with a smile:,"“The midwife and her maid, you know, a little blonde. What a pest the girl is! She was yelling at her employer that she had got rid of a child for the fruit woman and that she was going to tell the police if she wasn’t paid to keep quiet. So the midwife slapped her right in the face and then the little blonde jumped on her and started scratching her and pulling her hair, really—by the roots. The sausage-man had to grab her to put a stop to it.” The workwomen laughed. Then they all took a sip of coffee."
"- Ah ! l'animal ! reprit le zingueur étranglant de rire, tapant sur la table pour s'éclaircir la voix, il songe toujours aux bêtises ! ? Mais, bougre de serin, on est inventif ! Pas vrai ? il y a deux fenêtres, dans la pièce. Eh bien ! on en colle une par terre, on en fait une porte. Alors, comprends-tu, tu entres par la cour, nous bouchons même cette porte de communication, si ça nous plaît. Ni vu ni connu, tu es chez toi, nous sommes chez nous.","- Oh! the pet! resumed the zinc worker, choking with laughter, banging on the table to clear his throat, he's always thinking nonsense! ? But, bugger, we are inventive! Not true ? there are two windows in the room. Well ! we stick one on the ground, we make a door out of it. So, do you understand, you enter through the courtyard, we even block this door of communication, if we like. Neither seen nor known, you are at home, we are at home.","""Nonsense,"" said Coupeau. ""Have we no invention? There are two windows; can't one be cut down to the floor and used as a door? In that case you would enter from the court and not through the shop. You would be by yourself, and we by ourselves.""","“Ah, the rogue!” resumed the zinc-worker, choking with laughter, banging his fist down on the table, “he’s always thinking of something smutty! But, you joker, we’re of an inventive turn of mind! There’re two windows in the room, aren’t there? Well, we’ll knock one out and turn it into a door. Then, you understand you come in by way of the courtyard, and we can even stop up the other door, if we like. Thus you’ll be in your home, and we in ours.”"
Bibi-la-Grillade paraissait furieux. Il répétait entre ses dents :,Bibi-la-Grillade looked furious. He repeated between his teeth:,"""Upon my word!"" cried Mme Lorilleux, much scandalized.",Bibi-the-Smoker pretended to be furious. He muttered between his teeth.
"- C'est la colonne, dit Coupeau. Il y a le jaseron, le forçat, la gourmette, la corde. Mais ça, c'est la colonne. Lorilleux ne fait que la colonne.","""It's the column,"" said Coupeau. There is the jaseron, the convict, the bracelet, the cord. But that is the column. Lorilleux is only the column.","""I make columns."" ""Yes,"" said Coupeau in an explanatory voice, ""there are four different kinds of chains, and his style is called a column."" Lorilleux uttered a little grunt of satisfaction, all the time at work, with the tiny pincers held between very dirty nails.","“That’s the herring-bone chain,” said Coupeau. “There’s also the long link, the cable, the plain ring, and the spiral. But that’s the herring-bone. Lorilleux only makes the herring-bone chain.”"
"Trou la, trou la, trou la la !","Hole la, hole la, hole la la!",Virginie whispered to Gervaise:,"“Trou la la, trou la la,"
"- Mais il n'y a pas à se fâcher, murmura-t-elle, avec un sourire aimable. Madame peut regarder ses semelles.","- But there is nothing to be angry about, she murmured, with a friendly smile. Madame can look at her soles.","""If Mademoiselle would be so kind,"" she murmured with an amiable smile, ""and would just look at her soles herself. There is no cause for offense, I am sure!""","“There’s no reason to get angry,” murmured she with an amiable smile. “But, perhaps madame would not mind looking at the soles of her shoes.”"
"- Ça vous connaît, hein ? répétait madame Boche. Vous étiez blanchisseuse dans votre pays, n'est-ce pas, ma petite ?","- It knows you, huh? repeated Madame Boche. You were a laundress in your country, weren't you, my dear?","""You know?"" answered Boche curiously. ""You have washed then in your own place before you came here?""","“You’re used to it?” repeated Madame Boche. “You were a washerwoman in your native place, weren’t you, my dear?”"
"C'est que, dans le ménage des Coupeau, le vitriol de l'Assommoir commençait à faire aussi son ravage. La blanchisseuse voyait arriver l'heure où son homme prendrait un fouet comme Bijard, pour mener la danse. Et le malheur qui la menaçait, la rendait naturellement plus sensible encore au malheur de la petite. Oui, Coupeau filait un mauvais coton. L'heure était passée où le cric lui donnait des couleurs. Il ne pouvait plus se taper sur le torse, et crâner, en disant que le sacré chien l'engraissait ; car sa vilaine graisse jaune des premières années avait fondu, et il tournait au sécot, il se plombait, avec des tons verts de macchabée pourrissant dans une mare. L'appétit, lui aussi, était rasé. Peu à peu, il n'avait plus eu de goût pour le pain, il en était même arrivé à cracher sur le fricot. On aurait pu lui servir la ratatouille la mieux accommodée, son estomac se barrait, ses dents molles refusaient de mâcher. Pour se soutenir, il lui fallait sa chopine d'eau-de-vie par jour ; c'était sa ration, son manger et son boire, la seule nourriture qu'il digérât. Le matin, dès qu'il sautait du lit, il restait un gros quart d'heure plié en deux, toussant et claquant des os, se tenant la tête et lâchant de la pituite, quelque chose d'amer comme chicotin qui lui ramonait la gorge. Ça ne manquait jamais, on pouvait apprêter Thomas à l'avance. Il ne retombait d'aplomb sur ses pattes qu'après son premier verre de consolation, un vrai remède dont le feu lui cautérisait les boyaux. Mais, dans la journée, les forces reprenaient. D'abord, il avait senti des chatouilles, des picotements sur la peau, aux pieds et aux mains ; et il rigolait, il racontait qu'on lui faisait des minettes, que sa bourgeoise devait mettre du poil à gratter entre les draps. Puis, ses jambes étaient devenues lourdes, les chatouilles avaient fini par se changer en crampes abominables qui lui pinçaient la viande comme dans un étau. Ça, par exemple, lui semblait moins drôle. Il ne riait plus, s'arrêtait court sur le trottoir, étourdi, les oreilles bourdonnantes, les yeux aveuglés d'étincelles. Tout lui paraissait jaune, les maisons dansaient, il festonnait trois secondes, avec la peur de s'étaler. D'autres fois, l'échine au grand soleil, il avait un frisson, comme une eau glacée qui lui aurait coulé des épaules au derrière. Ce qui l'enquiquinait le plus, c'était un petit tremblement de ses deux mains ; la main droite surtout devait avoir commis un mauvais coup, tant elle avait des cauchemars. Nom de Dieu ! il n'était donc plus un homme, il tournait à la vieille femme ! Il tendait furieusement ses muscles, il empoignait son verre, pariait de le tenir immobile, comme au bout d'une main de marbre ; mais, le verre, malgré son effort, dansait le chahut, sautait à droite, sautait à gauche, avec un petit tremblement pressé et régulier. Alors, il se le vidait dans le coco, furieux, gueulant qu'il lui en faudrait des douzaines et qu'ensuite il se chargeait de porter un tonneau sans remuer un doigt. Gervaise lui disait au contraire de ne plus boire, s'il voulait cesser de trembler. Et il se fichait d'elle, il buvait des litres à recommencer l'expérience, s'enrageant, accusant les omnibus qui passaient de lui bousculer son liquide.","The vitriol of L'Assommoir was also beginning to wreak havoc in the Coupeau household. The laundress saw the hour coming when her man would take a whip like Bijard, to lead the dance. And the misfortune that threatened her naturally made her even more sensitive to the child's misfortune. Yes, Coupeau spun bad cotton. The time had passed when the jack gave him color. He could no longer beat himself on the chest, and show off, saying that the damned dog made him fat; for his ugly yellow grease of his early years had melted away, and he was turning to dryness, he was getting leaden, with the green tones of a stiff rotting in a pond. The appetite, too, was shaved. Little by little, he no longer had a taste for bread, he had even come to spit on the fricot. He could have been served the best suited ratatouille, his stomach was stopping, his soft teeth refused to chew. To sustain himself, he needed his pint of brandy a day; it was his ration, his food and drink, the only food he digested. In the morning, as soon as he jumped out of bed, he remained bent over for a good quarter of an hour, coughing and clicking his bones, holding his head and letting out pituite, something as bitter as snag that swept his throat. throat. It never failed, we could prepare Thomas in advance. He only landed on his feet after his first drink of consolation, a real remedy whose fire cauterized his guts. But, during the day, the strength resumed. First, he had felt tickling, tingling on his skin, on his feet and hands; and he was laughing, he was saying that they were teasing him, that his bourgeoise had to put hair to scratch between the sheets. Then, his legs had become heavy, the tickling had ended up changing into abominable cramps which pinched his meat like in a vise. That, for example, seemed less funny to him. He no longer laughed, stopped short on the sidewalk, dazed, his ears ringing, his eyes blinded by sparks. Everything seemed yellow to him, the houses danced, he festooned for three seconds, afraid of spreading out. Other times, his spine in the bright sun, he shivered, like icy water running from his shoulders to his behind. What bothered him the most was a slight tremor in both hands; the right hand especially must have done something wrong, she had so many nightmares. For God Sake ! he was therefore no longer a man, he was turning into an old woman! He tensed his muscles furiously, he grabbed his glass, bet on holding it motionless, as if at the end of a marble hand; but the glass, in spite of its effort, danced the ruckus, leapt to the right, leapt to the left, with a hurried and regular little trembling. So he emptied it into the coco, furious, yelling that he would need dozens of them and then he would carry a barrel without moving a finger. On the contrary, Gervaise told him not to drink any more, if he wanted to stop shivering. And he didn't care about her, he drank gallons of water trying to repeat the experiment, flying into a rage, accusing the passing omnibuses of jostling his liquid.","And Gervaise took this slender creature for example, whose eyes alone told the story of her misery and hardships, for in the Coupeau family the vitriol of the Assommoir was doing its work of destruction. Gervaise had seen a whip. Gervaise had learned to dread it, and this dread inspired her with tenderest pity for Lalie. Coupeau had lost the flesh and the bloated look which had been his, and he was thin and emaciated. His complexion was gradually acquiring a leaden hue. His appetite was utterly gone. It was with difficulty that he swallowed a mouthful of bread. His stomach turned against all solid food, but he took his brandy every day. This was his meat as well as his drink, and he touched nothing else. When he crawled out of his bed in the morning he stood for a good fifteen minutes, coughing and spitting out a bitter liquid that rose in his throat and choked him. He did not feel any better until he had taken what he called ""a good drink,"" and later in the day his strength returned. He felt strange prickings in the skin of his hands and feet. But lately his limbs had grown heavy. This pricking sensation gave place to the most excruciating cramps, which he did not find very amusing. He rarely laughed now but often stopped short and stood still on the sidewalk, troubled by a strange buzzing in his ears and by flashes of light before his eyes. Everything looked yellow to him; the houses seemed to be moving away from him. At other times, when the sun was full on his back, he shivered as if a stream of ice water had been poured down between his shoulders. But the thing he liked the least about himself was a nervous trembling in his hands, the right hand especially. Had he become an old woman then? he asked himself with sudden fury. He tried with all his strength to lift his glass and command his nerves enough to hold it steady. But the glass had a regular tremulous movement from right to left and left to right again, in spite of all his efforts. Then he emptied it down his throat, saying that when he had swallowed a dozen more he would be all right and as steady as a monument. Gervaise told him, on the contrary, that he must leave off drinking if he wished to leave off trembling. He grew very angry and drank quarts in his eagerness to test the question, finally declaring that it was the passing omnibusses that jarred the house and shook his hand.","In the Coupeau household the vitriol of l’Assommoir was also commencing its ravages. Gervaise could see the day coming when her husband would get a whip like Bijard’s to make her dance. Yes, Coupeau was spinning an evil thread. The time was past when a drink would make him feel good. His unhealthy soft fat of earlier years had melted away and he was beginning to wither and turn a leaden grey. He seemed to have a greenish tint like a corpse putrefying in a pond. He no longer had a taste for food, not even the most beautifully prepared stew. His stomach would turn and his decayed teeth refuse to touch it. A pint a day was his daily ration, the only nourishment he could digest. When he awoke in the mornings he sat coughing and spitting up bile for at least a quarter of an hour. It never failed, you might as well have the basin ready. He was never steady on his pins till after his first glass of consolation, a real remedy, the fire of which cauterized his bowels; but during the day his strength returned. At first he would feel a tickling sensation, a sort of pins-and-needles in his hands and feet; and he would joke, relating that someone was having a lark with him, that he was sure his wife put horse-hair between the sheets. Then his legs would become heavy, the tickling sensation would end by turning into the most abominable cramps, which gripped his flesh as though in a vise. That though did not amuse him so much. He no longer laughed; he stopped suddenly on the pavement in a bewildered way with a ringing in his ears and his eyes blinded with sparks. Everything appeared to him to be yellow; the houses danced and he reeled about for three seconds with the fear of suddenly finding himself sprawling on the ground. At other times, while the sun was shining full on his back, he would shiver as though iced water had been poured down his shoulders. What bothered him the most was a slight trembling of both his hands; the right hand especially must have been guilty of some crime, it suffered from so many nightmares. Mon Dieu! was he then no longer a man? He was becoming an old woman! He furiously strained his muscles, he seized hold of his glass and bet that he would hold it perfectly steady as with a hand of marble; but in spite of his efforts the glass danced about, jumped to the right, jumped to the left with a hurried and regular trembling movement. Then in a fury he emptied it into his gullet, yelling that he would require dozens like it, and afterwards he undertook to carry a cask without so much as moving a finger. Gervaise, on the other hand, told him to give up drink if he wished to cease trembling, and he laughed at her, emptying quarts until he experienced the sensation again, flying into a rage and accusing the passing omnibuses of shaking up his liquor."
"Puis, son cœur se brisa, il ne put retenir ce cri :","Then, his heart broke, he could not hold back this cry:",He staggered to his feet and stood leaning against the bed and looking at her.,"Then, his heart breaking, he could not restrain himself and burst out:"
"- Dites donc, madame Coupeau ! cria Virginie qui suivait le travail de la laveuse, les lèvres pincées, vous laissez de la crasse, là-bas, dans ce coin. Frottez-moi donc un peu mieux ça !","- Tell me, Madame Coupeau! shouted Virginie, who was following the work of the washer, her lips pursed, you're leaving dirt over there, in that corner. So rub me a little better!","""Really, Madame Coupeau,"" cried Virginie, ""can't you do better than that? You have left all the dirt in the corners. Don't you see? Oblige me by doing that over again.""","“Look here, Madame Coupeau!” cried Virginie, who was watching the scrubbing with compressed lips, “you have left some dirt over there in the corner. Scrub that rather better please.”"
"- Tiens, porte ça au clou.","- Here, take this to the nail.","""Take them,"" he said, ""and make haste back from the pawnbroker's.""","“Here, go and pop this.”"
"Mais, comme elle avait déjà fait trois pas sur le trottoir, elle rouvrit la porte pour crier qu'elle voyait Augustine au bout de la rue, en train de glisser sur la glace avec des gamins. Cette gredine-là était partie depuis deux grandes heures. Elle accourut rouge, essoufflée, son panier au bras, le chignon emplâtré par une boule de neige ; et elle se laissa gronder d'un air sournois, en racontant qu'on ne pouvait pas marcher, à cause du verglas. Quelque voyou avait dû, par blague, lui fourrer des morceaux de glace dans les poches ; car, au bout d'un quart d'heure, ses poches se mirent à arroser la boutique comme des entonnoirs.","But, as she had already taken three steps on the sidewalk, she opened the door again to shout that she saw Augustine at the end of the street, sliding on the ice with some kids. That scoundrel had been gone two long hours. She ran up flushed, out of breath, her basket on her arm, her bun plastered with a ball of snow; and she allowed herself to be scolded with a sly air, saying that they couldn't walk because of the ice. Some hoodlum must have jokingly stuffed pieces of ice cream into his pockets; for after a quarter of an hour his pockets began to water the shop like funnels.","The better part of the day was now gone, and it was this way every day, for the shop was the refuge and haunt of all the chilly people in the neighborhood.","She had only just stepped outside when she turned back to say that Augustine was at the end of the street, sliding on the ice with some urchins. The squint-eyed imp rushed in all red-faced and out of breath with snow all in her hair. She didn’t mind the scolding she received, merely saying that she hadn’t been able to walk fast because of the ice and then some brats threw snow at her."
"- Il est claqué, dit-elle en poussant la porte, tranquillement, la mine éreintée et abêtie.","- It's slammed, she said, pushing open the door, quietly, her face exhausted and stupid.","""He is dead,"" she said quietly as she moved on.","“He’s gone,” said she, quietly, as she pushed open the door, looking tired out and dull."
"Cependant, Gervaise restait conciliante, discutait paisiblement ces mauvaises raisons. Elle tâchait d'attendrir les Lorilleux. Mais le mari finit par ne plus lui répondre. La femme maintenant était devant la forge, en train de dérocher un bout de chaîne, dans la petite casserole de cuivre à long manche, pleine d'eau seconde. Elle affectait toujours de tourner le dos, comme à cent lieues. Et Gervaise parlait encore, les regardant s'entêter au travail, au milieu de la poussière noire de l'atelier, le corps déjeté, les vêtements rapiécés et graisseux, devenus d'une dureté abêtie de vieux outils, dans leur besogne étroite de machine. Alors, brusquement, la colère remonta à sa gorge, elle cria :","However, Gervaise remained conciliatory, peacefully discussing these bad reasons. She tried to soften the Lorilleuxs. But the husband ends up no longer answering her. The woman was now in front of the forge, picking off a piece of chain from the little long-handled copper saucepan full of second water. She always affected to turn her back, as if a hundred leagues away. And Gervaise was still talking, watching them stubbornly work, in the middle of the black dust of the workshop, their bodies thrown off, their clothes patched and greasy, which had become dulled by the hardness of old tools, in their narrow machine work. . Then, suddenly, the anger rose to her throat, she cried:","Then Gervaise grew angry again. She looked at her sister-in-law and saw her face set in vindictive firmness. ""Keep your money,"" she cried.","Gervaise remained conciliatory, and peaceably argued against all this bad reasoning. She tried to soften the Lorilleuxs. But the husband ended by no longer answering her. The wife was now at the forge scouring a piece of chain in the little, long-handled brass saucepan full of lye-water. She still affectedly turned her back, as though a hundred leagues away. And Gervaise continued speaking, watching them pretending to be absorbed in their labor in the midst of the black dust of the workshop, their bodies distorted, their clothes patched and greasy, both become stupidly hardened like old tools in the pursuit of their narrow mechanical task. Then suddenly anger again got the better of her and she exclaimed: “Very well, I’d"
"- Eh bien ? dit la blanchisseuse, la voix un peu tremblante, qu'est-ce que ça peut me faire ?","- Well ? said the laundress, her voice a little shaky, what does it matter to me?","""Well, what of it?"" asked Gervaise, her voice trembling. ""What have I to do with that?""","“Well,” said the laundress, her voice trembling slightly, “what can it matter to me?”"
"- Voulez-vous parier ! le mois prochain, ils inventeront une autre histoire ? Ça explique pourquoi ils bouchent leur fenêtre, quand ils mangent un lapin. N'est-ce pas ? on serait en droit de leur dire : « Puisque vous mangez un lapin, vous pouvez bien donner cent sous à votre mère. » Oh ! ils ont du vice ! ? Qu'est-ce que vous seriez devenue, si je ne vous avais pas prise avec nous ?","- Do you want to bet! next month, they will invent another story? That explains why they block up their window when they eat a rabbit. Is not it ? one would have the right to say to them: ""Since you are eating a rabbit, you can very well give a hundred sous to your mother."" "" Oh ! they have vice! ? What would have become of you if I hadn't taken you with us?","""I will wager that next month they will invent another tale. That is one reason why they lock their doors when they have a rabbit. They think people might say, 'If you can eat rabbits you can give five francs to your mother!' How mean they are! What do they think would have become of you if I had not asked you to come and live here?""",“I’ll bet next month they’ll concoct some other story. That explains why they cover their window up when they have a rabbit to eat. Don’t you see? One would have the right to say to them: ‘As you can afford a rabbit you can certainly give five francs to your mother!’ Oh! they’re just rotten! What would have become of you if I hadn’t taken you to live with us?”
"- Tiens ! c'est toi, la vieille ! cria le zingueur, qu'un ricanement étranglait. Ah ! elle est farce, par exemple ! ? Hein ? pas vrai, elle est farce !","- Take ! it's you, the old one! cried the zinc worker, choking with a sneer. Ah! she is farce, for example! ? Eh ? not true, she's a joke!","""She is crazy!"" said Coupeau when he saw her. ""I tell you, she is crazy!""","“Hullo! It’s you, old woman!” exclaimed the zinc-worker, half choking with a chuckle. “Ah! that’s a good joke. Isn’t it a good joke now?”"
"Une robe surtout lui alla à la perfection. C'était une robe blanche à pois roses, très simple, sans garniture aucune. La jupe, un peu courte, dégageait ses pieds ; les manches, largement ouvertes et tombantes, découvraient ses bras jusqu'aux coudes ; l'encolure du corsage, qu'elle ouvrait en cœur avec des épingles, dans un coin noir de l'escalier, pour éviter les calottes du père Coupeau, montrait la neige de son cou et l'ombre dorée de sa gorge. Et rien autre, rien qu'un ruban rose noué autour de ses cheveux blonds, un ruban dont les bouts s'envolaient sur sa nuque. Elle avait là-dedans une fraîcheur de bouquet. Elle sentait bon la jeunesse, le nu de l'enfant et de la femme.","One dress especially suited her perfectly. It was a white dress with pink polka dots, very simple, without any trimmings. The skirt, a little short, freed her feet; the sleeves, wide open and drooping, exposed her arms to the elbows; the neckline of the bodice, which she opened like a heart with pins, in a dark corner of the stairs, to avoid old Coupeau's caps, showed the snow on her neck and the golden shadow of her bosom. And nothing else, nothing but a pink ribbon tied around her blond hair, a ribbon whose ends flew down her neck. She had in it the freshness of a bouquet. She smelled good of youth, the nakedness of children and women.","One gown, in particular, suited her to perfection. It was white with rose-colored dots, without trimming of any kind. The skirt was short and showed her feet. The sleeves were very wide and displayed her arms to the elbows. She turned the neck away and fastened it with pins—in a corner in the corridor, dreading her father's jests—to exhibit her pretty rounded throat. A rose-colored ribbon, knotted in the rippling masses of her hair, completed her toilet. She was a charming combination of child and woman.","There was one dress which suited her perfectly, a white one with pink dots. It was very simple and without a frill. The skirt was rather short and revealed her ankles. The sleeves were deeply slashed and loose, showing her arms to the elbow. She pinned the neck back into a wide V as soon as she reached a dark corner of the staircase to avoid getting her ears boxed by her father for exposing the snowy whiteness of her throat and the golden shadow between her breasts. She also tied a pink ribbon round her blond hair. Sundays she spent the entire day out with the crowds and loved it when the men eyed her hungrily as they passed."
"Le père Colombe, paisiblement, servait. Une autre société de trois ouvriers arriva. Peu à peu, les blouses s'amassaient à l'angle du trottoir, faisaient là une courte station finissaient par se pousser dans la salle, entre les deux lauriers-roses gris de poussière.","Father Colombe peacefully served. Another company of three workers arrived. Gradually the smocks piled up at the corner of the sidewalk, made a short station there, and ended up pushing each other into the room, between the two oleanders gray with dust.","Presently three more workmen entered together, and finally a crowd of blouses passed in between the dusty oleanders.",Pere Colombe served them as three more laborers entered. More blue smocks gathered on the street corner and some pushed their way into the establishment.

"Dès le lendemain, le propriétaire, M. Marescot, étant venu passer une heure dans la loge des Boche, Gervaise lui parla de l'affaire. Il se montra d'abord inquiet, refusant, se fâchant, comme si elle lui avait demandé d'abattre toute une aile de sa maison. Puis, après une inspection minutieuse des lieux, lorsqu'il eut regardé en l'air pour voir si les étages supérieurs n'allaient pas être ébranlés, il finit par donner l'autorisation, mais à la condition de ne supporter aucun frais ; et les Coupeau durent lui signer un papier, dans lequel ils s'engageaient à rétablir les choses en l'état, à l'expiration de leur bail. Le soir même, le zingueur amena des camarades, un maçon, un menuisier, un peintre, de bons zigs qui feraient cette bricole-là après leur journée, histoire de rendre service. La pose de la nouvelle porte, le nettoyage de la pièce, n'en coûtèrent pas moins une centaine de francs, sans compter les litres dont on arrosa la besogne. Le zingueur dit aux camarades qu'il leur paierait ça plus tard, avec le premier argent de son locataire. Ensuite, il fut question de meubler la pièce. Gervaise y laissa l'armoire de maman Coupeau ; elle ajouta une table et deux chaises, prises dans sa propre chambre ; il lui fallut enfin acheter une table-toilette et un lit, avec la literie complète, en tout cent trente francs, qu'elle devait payer à raison de dix francs par mois. Si, pendant une dizaine de mois, les vingt francs de Lantier se trouvaient mangés à l'avance par les dettes contractées, plus tard il y aurait un joli bénéfice.","The next day, the proprietor, M. Marescot, having come to spend an hour in the lodge of the Boches, Gervaise spoke to him of the affair. At first he showed concern, refusing, getting angry, as if she had asked him to knock down a whole wing of his house. Then, after a careful inspection of the premises, when he had looked up to see if the upper floors were not going to be shaken, he finally gave the authorization, but on the condition of bearing no expense; and the Coupeaus had to sign a paper for him, in which they undertook to restore things to the state they were on the expiration of their lease. That same evening, the zinc worker brought along some comrades, a mason, a carpenter, a painter, good zigs who would do this odd job after their day, just to help. The installation of the new door, the cleaning of the room, cost none the less a hundred francs, without counting the liters with which the work was sprinkled. The zinc worker told the comrades that he would pay them later, with his tenant's first money. Then it was a question of furnishing the room. Gervaise left Maman Coupeau's cupboard there; she added a table and two chairs, taken from her own room; finally she had to buy a dressing table and a bed, complete with bedding, in all one hundred and thirty francs, which she had to pay at the rate of ten francs a month. If, for ten months, Lantier's twenty francs were eaten up in advance by contracted debts, later there would be a nice profit.","The next morning Marescot, the owner of the house, happening to call, Gervaise spoke to him of the matter. At first he absolutely refused and was as disturbed and angry as if she had asked him to build on a wing for her especial accommodation. Then after a minute examination of the premises he ended by giving his consent, only on condition, however, that he should not be required to pay any portion of the expense, and the Coupeaus signed a paper, agreeing to put everything into its original condition at the expiration of their lease. That same evening Coupeau brought in a mason, a painter and a carpenter, all friends and boon companions of his, who would do this little job at night, after their day's work was over. The cutting of the door, the painting and the cleaning would come to about one hundred francs, and Coupeau agreed to pay them as fast as his tenant paid him. The next question was how to furnish the room? Gervaise left Mamma Coupeau's wardrobe in it. She added a table and two chairs from her own room. She was compelled to buy a bed and dressing table and divers other things, which amounted to one hundred and thirty francs. This she must pay for ten francs each month. So that for nearly a year they could derive no benefit from their new lodger.","The next day when the landlord, Monsieur Marescot, came to spend an hour with the Boches, Gervaise mentioned the matter to him. He refused angrily at first. Then, after a careful inspection of the premises, particularly gazing upward to verify that the upper floors would not be weakened, he finally granted permission on condition there would be no expense to him. He had the Coupeaus sign a paper saying they would restore everything to its original state on the expiration of the lease. Coupeau brought in some friends of his that very evening—a mason, a carpenter and a painter. They would do this job in the evenings as a favor to him. Still, installing the door and cleaning up the room cost over one hundred francs, not counting the wine that kept the work going. Coupeau told his friends he’d pay them something later, out of the rent from his tenant. Then the furniture for the room had to be sorted out. Gervaise left mother Coupeau’s wardrobe where it was, and added a table and two chairs taken from her own room. She had to buy a washing-stand and a bed with mattress and bedclothes, costing one hundred and thirty francs, which she was to pay off at ten francs a month. Although Lantier’s twenty francs would be used to pay off these debts for ten months, there would be a nice little profit later."
"Le pis était que Lantier se sentait soutenu et changeait de manières à l'égard de Gervaise. Maintenant, quand il lui donnait une poignée de main, il lui gardait un instant les doigts entre les siens. Il la fatiguait de son regard, fixait sur elle des yeux hardis, où elle lisait nettement ce qu'il lui demandait. S'il passait derrière elle, il enfonçait les genoux dans ses jupes, soufflait sur son cou, comme pour l'endormir. Pourtant, il attendit encore, avant d'être brutal et de se déclarer. Mais, un soir, se trouvant seul avec elle, il la poussa devant lui sans dire une parole, l'accula tremblante contre le mur, au fond de la boutique, et là voulut l'embrasser. Le hasard fit que Goujet entra juste à ce moment. Alors, elle se débattit, s'échappa. Et tous trois échangèrent quelques mots, comme si de rien n'était. Goujet, la face toute blanche, avait baissé le nez, en s'imaginant qu'il les dérangeait, qu'elle venait de se débattre pour ne pas être embrassée devant le monde.","The worst was that Lantier felt supported and changed his ways towards Gervaise. Now, when he gave her a handshake, he kept her fingers between his for a moment. He tired her with his gaze, fixed bold eyes on her, in which she clearly read what he was asking of her. If he passed behind her, he would bury his knees in her skirts, blow on her neck, as if to put her to sleep. However, he still waited, before being brutal and declaring himself. But one evening, finding himself alone with her, he pushed her in front of him without saying a word, drove her trembling against the wall, at the back of the shop, and there wanted to kiss her. As luck would have it, Goujet entered just at this moment. So she struggled, escaped. And all three exchanged a few words, as if nothing had happened. Goujet, her face all white, had lowered her nose, imagining that he was bothering them, that she had just struggled not to be kissed in front of the world.","Lantier was gradually changing his manner to Gervaise. Now when he shook hands with her he held her fingers longer than was necessary. He watched her incessantly and fixed his bold eyes upon her. He leaned over her so closely that she felt his breath on her cheek. But one evening, being alone with her, he caught her in both arms. At that moment Goujet entered. Gervaise wrenched herself free, and the three exchanged a few words as if nothing had happened. Goujet was very pale and seemed embarrassed, supposing that he had intruded upon them and that she had pushed Lantier aside only because she did not choose to be embraced in public.","The worst of it was that Lantier, feeling himself supported by public opinion, changed altogether in his behavior towards Gervaise. Now, whenever he shook hands with her, he held her fingers for a minute between his own. He tried her with his glance, fixing a bold look upon her, in which she clearly read that he wanted her. If he passed behind her, he dug his knees into her skirt, or breathed upon her neck. Yet he waited a while before being rough and openly declaring himself. But one evening, finding himself alone with her, he pushed her before him without a word, and viewed her all trembling against the wall at the back of the shop, and tried to kiss her. It so chanced that Goujet entered just at that moment. Then she struggled and escaped. And all three exchanged a few words, as though nothing had happened. Goujet, his face deadly pale, looked on the ground, fancying that he had disturbed them, and that she had merely struggled so as not to be kissed before a third party."
"La sage-femme refusa ; mais elle voulut bien boire un verre de vin, parce que ça l'avait émotionnée, disait-elle, de trouver la malheureuse femme avec le bébé sur le paillasson. Coupeau partit enfin, pour annoncer la nouvelle à la famille. Une demi-heure plus tard, il revint avec tout le monde, maman Coupeau, les Lorilleux, madame Lerat, qu'il avait justement rencontrée chez ces derniers. Les Lorilleux, devant la prospérité du ménage, étaient devenus très aimables, faisaient un éloge outré de Gervaise, en laissant échapper de petits gestes restrictifs, des hochements de menton, des battements de paupières, comme pour ajourner leur vrai jugement. Enfin, ils savaient ce qu'ils savaient ; seulement, ils ne voulaient pas aller contre l'opinion de tout le quartier.","The midwife refused; but she was willing to drink a glass of wine, because she said it had upset her to find the unhappy woman with the baby on the doormat. Coupeau finally left to announce the news to the family. Half an hour later he returned with everyone, Maman Coupeau, the Lorilleuxs, Madame Lerat, whom he had just met at the latter's. The Lorilleuxs, faced with the prosperity of the household, had become very amiable, exaggeratedly eulogized Gervaise, letting out little restrictive gestures, nods of the chin, fluttering of the eyelids, as if to defer their true judgment. Finally, they knew what they knew; only they didn't want to go against the opinion of the whole neighborhood.","He finally set forth to announce the news to his family and returned in an hour with them all. The Lorilleuxs, under the influence of the prosperity of their brother and his wife, had become extremely amiable toward them and only lifted their eyebrows in a significant sort of way, as much as to say that they could tell something if they pleased.","The midwife declined; but she was willing to accept a glass of wine, because it had upset her, said she to find the poor woman with the baby on the mat. Coupeau at length went off to tell the news to his relations. Half an hour later he returned with all of them, mother Coupeau, the Lorilleuxs, and Madame Lerat, whom he had met at the latter’s."
"- Oh ! les rats, v'là les rats, à cette heure !","- Oh ! the rats, here come the rats, at this hour!","""The rats! Oh, the rats!""","“Oh! the rats, there’re the rats now!”"
"Quand Gervaise déboucha des corridors sur le palier du sixième, elle ne put retenir cette parole, les larmes aux yeux :","When Gervaise emerged from the corridors onto the landing on the sixth floor, she could not restrain these words, tears in her eyes:",When Gervaise emerged from the narrow corridors on the sixth landing she said with tears in her eyes:,"When Gervaise emerged from the corridor on to the landing, she could not help saying, with tears in her eyes:"
"Coupeau, lui aussi, ne comprenait pas qu'on pût avaler de pleins verres d'eau-de-vie. Une prune par-ci par-là, ça n'était pas mauvais. Quant au vitriol, à l'absinthe et aux autres cochonneries, bonsoir ! il n'en fallait pas. Les camarades avaient beau le blaguer, il restait à la porte, lorsque ces cheulards-là entraient à la mine à poivre. Le papa Coupeau, qui était zingueur comme lui, s'était écrabouillé la tête sur le pavé de la rue Coquenard, en tombant, un jour de ribote, de la gouttière du n° 25 ; et ce souvenir, dans la famille, les rendait tous sages. Lui, lorsqu'il passait rue Coquenard et qu'il voyait la place, il aurait plutôt bu l'eau du ruisseau que d'avaler un canon gratis chez le marchand de vin. Il conclut par cette phrase :","Coupeau, too, did not understand how one could swallow full glasses of brandy. A plum here and there wasn't bad. As for vitriol, absinthe and other junk, good evening! it was not necessary. No matter how hard the comrades joked about him, he stayed at the door when those buggers entered the pepper mine. Papa Coupeau, who was a zinc worker like him, had crushed his head on the cobblestones of the rue Coquenard, when he fell, one day drunk, from the gutter at No. 25; and this memory, in the family, made them all wise. As for him, when he passed rue Coquenard and saw the square, he would rather have drunk the water from the stream than swallowed a cannon for free at the wine merchant's. He concludes with this sentence:","Coupeau also failed to understand how a man could swallow glasses of brandy and water, one after the other. Brandied fruit, now and again, was not bad. As to absinthe and similar abominations, he never touched them—not he, indeed. His comrades might laugh at him as much as they pleased; he always remained on the other side of the door when they came in to swallow perdition like that. His father, who was a tinworker like himself, had fallen one day from the roof of No. 25, in La Rue Coquenaud, and this recollection had made him very prudent ever since. As for himself, when he passed through that street and saw the place he would sooner drink the water in the gutter than swallow a drop at the wineshop. He concluded with the sentence:","For himself, Coupeau couldn’t understand how anyone could drink glass after glass of cheap brandy. A brandied plum occasionally could not hurt, but as for cheap brandy, absinthe and the other strong stuff, no, not for him, no matter how much his comrades teased him about it. He stayed out on the sidewalk when his friends went into low establishments. Coupeau’s father had smashed his head open one day when he fell from the eaves of No. 25 on Rue Coquenard. He was drunk. This memory keeps Coupeau’s entire family from the drink. Every time Coupeau passed that spot, he thought he would rather lick up water from the gutter than accept a free drink in a bar. He would always say: “In our trade, you have to have steady legs.”"
"Puis, la noce se lança dans la longue galerie où sont les écoles italiennes et flamandes. Encore des tableaux, toujours des tableaux, des saints, des hommes et des femmes avec des figures qu'on ne comprenait pas, des paysages tout noirs, des bêtes devenues jaunes, une débandade de gens et de choses dont le violent tapage de couleurs commençait à leur causer un gros mal de tête. M. Madinier ne parlait plus, menait lentement le cortège, qui le suivait en ordre, tous les cous tordus et les yeux en l'air. Des siècles d'art passaient devant leur ignorance ahurie, la sécheresse fine des primitifs, les splendeurs des Vénitiens, la vie grasse et belle de lumière des Hollandais. Mais ce qui les intéressait le plus, c'étaient encore les copistes, avec leurs chevalets installés parmi le monde, peignant sans gêne ; une vieille dame, montée sur une grande échelle, promenant un pinceau à badigeon dans le ciel tendre d'une immense toile, les frappa d'une façon particulière. Peu à peu, pourtant, le bruit avait dû se répandre qu'une noce visitait le Louvre ; des peintres accouraient, la bouche fendue d'un rire ; des curieux s'asseyaient à l'avance sur des banquettes, pour assister commodément au défilé ; tandis que les gardiens, les lèvres pincées, retenaient des mots d'esprit. Et la noce, déjà lasse, perdant de son respect, traînait ses souliers à clous, tapait ses talons sur les parquets sonores, avec le piétinement d'un troupeau débandé, lâché au milieu de la propreté nue et recueillie des salles.","Then, the wedding party launched into the long gallery where the Italian and Flemish schools are. More paintings, always paintings, saints, men and women with faces that we didn't understand, completely black landscapes, animals that had turned yellow, a stampede of people and things whose violent clash of colors was beginning cause them a big headache. M. Madinier no longer spoke, slowly leading the procession, which followed him in order, all necks twisted and eyes in the air. Centuries of art passed before their bewildered ignorance, the fine dryness of the primitives, the splendors of the Venetians, the life rich and beautiful in the light of the Dutch. But what interested them most were still the copyists, with their easels installed among the people, painting without embarrassment; an old lady, mounted on a large ladder, waving a whitewash brush across the soft sky of an immense canvas, struck them in a particular way. Gradually, however, the rumor must have spread that a wedding party was visiting the Louvre; painters came running up, their mouths split with laughter; curious people sat down in advance on benches, to conveniently watch the procession; while the guards, pursed lips, held back witticisms. And the wedding party, already weary, losing its respect, dragged its nailed shoes, tapped its heels on the noisy parquet floors, with the stamping of a disbanded herd, let loose in the midst of the bare and meditative cleanliness of the halls.","The wedding party finally entered the long gallery devoted to the Italian and Flemish schools of art. The pictures were all meaningless to them, and their heads were beginning to ache. They felt a thrill of interest, however, in the copyists with their easels, who painted without being disturbed by spectators. The artists scattered through the rooms had heard that a primitive wedding party was making a tour of the Louvre and hurried with laughing faces to enjoy the scene, while the weary bride and bridegroom, accompanied by their friends, clumsily moved about over the shining, resounding floors much like cattle let loose and with quite as keen an appreciation of the marvelous beauties about them.","Then the wedding party invaded the long gallery occupied by the Italian and Flemish schools. More paintings, always paintings, saints, men and women, with faces which some of them could understand, landscapes that were all black, animals turned yellow, a medley of people and things, the great mixture of the colors of which was beginning to give them all violent headaches. Monsieur Madinier no longer talked as he slowly headed the procession, which followed him in good order, with stretched necks and upcast eyes. Centuries of art passed before their bewildered ignorance, the fine sharpness of the early masters, the splendors of the Venetians, the vigorous life, beautiful with light, of the Dutch painters. But what interested them most were the artists who were copying, with their easels planted amongst the people, painting away unrestrainedly; an old lady, mounted on a pair of high steps, working a big brush over the delicate sky of an immense painting, struck them as something most peculiar. Slowly the word must have gone around that a wedding party was visiting the Louvre. Several painters came over with big smiles. Some visitors were so curious that they went to sit on benches ahead of the group in order to be comfortable while they watched them pass in review. Museum guards bit back comments. The wedding party was now quite weary and beginning to drag their feet."
"- Il adore le maquereau, dit-elle. Il faut bien les gâter, ces vilains hommes, n'est-ce pas ? ? Mais, montez donc. Vous verrez notre chez nous ? Nous sommes ici dans un courant d'air.","- He loves mackerel, she said. You have to spoil them, these naughty men, don't you? ? But, go up. Will you see our home? We are here in a draught.","She had just been out to buy this mackerel for him. ""He adores them,"" she said, ""and we women spoil our husbands, I think. But come up. We are standing in a draft here.""","“He adores mackerel,” said she. “We must spoil them, those naughty men, mustn’t we? But come up. You shall see our home. We are standing in a draught here.”"
"Coupeau avança les chaises, fit asseoir Gervaise au bord du rideau. La pièce était si étroite, qu'il ne put se caser à côté d'elle. Il s'assit en arrière, et il se penchait pour lui donner, dans le cou, des explications sur le travail. La jeune femme, interdite par l'étrange accueil des Lorilleux, mal à l'aise sous leurs regards obliques, avait un bourdonnement aux oreilles qui l'empêchait d'entendre. Elle trouvait la femme très vieille pour ses trente ans, l'air revêche, malpropre avec ses cheveux queue de vache, roulés sur sa camisole défaite. Le mari, d'une année plus âgé seulement, lui semblait un vieillard, aux minces lèvres méchantes, en manches de chemise, les pieds nus dans des pantoufles éculées. Et ce qui la consternait surtout, c'était la petitesse de l'atelier, les murs barbouillés, la ferraille ternie des outils, toute la saleté noire traînant là dans un bric-à-brac de marchand de vieux clous. Il faisait terriblement chaud. Des gouttes de sueur perlaient sur la face verdie de Lorilleux ; tandis que madame Lorilleux se décidait à retirer sa camisole, les bras nus, la chemise plaquant sur les seins tombés.","Coupeau moved the chairs forward and seated Gervaise on the edge of the curtain. The room was so cramped that he couldn't fit next to her. He sat back, and leaned over to explain the work to her neck. The young woman, taken aback by the strange welcome of the Lorilleuxs, uneasy under their oblique gazes, had a ringing in her ears which prevented her from hearing. She thought the woman was very old for her thirty years, looking surly, dirty with her cow tail hair, rolled up over her undone camisole. The husband, only a year older, looked like an old man to her, with thin wicked lips, in shirt sleeves, his bare feet in threadbare slippers. And what dismayed her above all was the smallness of the workshop, the smeared walls, the tarnished scrap metal of the tools, all the black dirt lying around in the bric-a-brac of an old nail dealer. It was terribly hot. Drops of sweat beaded on Lorilleux's green face; while Madame Lorilleux made up her mind to take off her camisole, her arms bare, the shirt flattening her sagging breasts.","Coupeau found two chairs and made Gervaise seat herself near the curtain. The room was so narrow that he could not sit beside her, so he placed his chair a little behind and leaned over her to give her the information he deemed desirable. Gervaise, astonished by the strange reception given her by these people and uncomfortable under their sidelong glances, had a buzzing in her ears which prevented her from hearing what was said. She thought the woman very old looking for her thirty years and also extremely untidy, with her hair tumbling over her shoulders and her dirty camisole. The husband, not more than a year older, seemed to Gervaise really an old man with thin, compressed lips and bowed figure. He was in his shirt sleeves, and his naked feet were thrust into slippers down at the heel. She was infinitely astonished at the smallness of the atelier, at the blackened walls and at the terrible heat. Tiny drops bedewed the waxed forehead of Lorilleux himself, while Mme Lorilleux threw off her sack and stood in bare arms and chemise half slipped off.","Coupeau moved the chairs forward and seated Gervaise by the curtain. The room was so narrow that he could not sit beside her, so he sat behind her, leaning over her shoulder to explain the work in progress. Gervaise was intimidated by this strange reception and felt uneasy. She had a buzzing in her ears and couldn’t hear clearly. She thought the wife looked older than her thirty years and not very neat with her hair in a pigtail dangling down the back of her loosely worn wrapper. The husband, who was only a year older, appeared already an old man with mean, thin lips, as he sat there working in his shirt sleeves with his bare feet thrust into down at the heel slippers. Gervaise was dismayed by the smallness of the shop, the grimy walls, the rustiness of the tools, and the black soot spread all over what looked like the odds and ends of a scrap-iron peddler’s wares."
"- Oh ! monsieur Coupeau, murmura-t-elle, qu'est-ce que vous allez chercher là ! Je ne vous ai jamais demandé cette chose, vous le savez bien ? Ça ne me convenait pas, voilà tout ? Oh ! non, non, c'est sérieux, maintenant, réfléchissez, je vous en prie.","- Oh ! Monsieur Coupeau, she murmured, what are you looking for there! I never asked you that thing, you know that? It didn't suit me, that's all? Oh ! no, no, it's serious, now, think about it, please.","Gervaise was astonished and very grave. ""Oh, Monsieur Coupeau, I never dreamed of this, as you know very well, and you must not take such a step lightly.""","“Oh! Monsieur Coupeau,” murmured she, “whatever are you thinking of? You know I’ve never asked you for that. I didn’t care about it—that was all. Oh, no, no! it’s serious now; think of what you’re saying, I beg of you.”"
"Alors, un silence régna. On n'entendit plus, pendant un instant, que les coups sourds, étouffés sur la couverture. Aux deux côtés de la vaste table carrée, la patronne, les deux ouvrières et l'apprentie, debout, se penchaient, toutes à leur besogne, les épaules arrondies, les bras promenés dans un va-et-vient continu. Chacune, à sa droite, avait un carreau, une brique plate, brûlée par les fers trop chauds. Au milieu de la table, au bord d'une assiette creuse pleine d'eau claire, trempaient un chiffon et une petite brosse. Un bouquet de grands lis, dans un ancien bocal de cerises à l'eau-de-vie, s'épanouissait, mettait là un coin de jardin royal, avec la touffe de ses larges fleurs de neige. Madame Putois avait attaqué le panier de linge préparé par Gervaise, des serviettes, des pantalons, des camisoles, des paires de manches. Augustine faisait traîner ses bas et ses torchons, le nez en l'air, intéressée par une grosse mouche qui volait. Quant à la grande Clémence, elle en était, depuis le matin, à sa trente-cinquième chemise d'homme.","Then a silence reigned. All that was heard, for a moment, was the dull, muffled knocks on the blanket. At either side of the vast square table, the landlady, the two workwomen and the apprentice, standing, leaned over, all at their work, their shoulders rounded, their arms swinging back and forth continuously. Each, on her right, had a tile, a flat brick, burned by the too hot irons. In the middle of the table, at the edge of a soup plate full of clear water, were soaking a rag and a small brush. A bouquet of large lilies, in an old jar of brandied cherries, was blooming, creating a corner of the royal garden, with the tuft of its large snow flowers. Madame Putois had attacked the basket of linen prepared by Gervaise, towels, trousers, camisoles, pairs of sleeves. Augustine was dragging her stockings and dishcloths, her nose in the air, interested in a big fly flying by. As for tall Clemence, she had been wearing her thirty-fifth man's shirt since the morning.","She then hung a sheet before the window to keep out the sun. Coupeau took a place in the corner, refusing to budge an inch, and his wife and all her assistants went to work on each side of the square table. Each woman had at her right a flat brick on which to set her iron. In the center of the table a dish of water with a rag and a brush in it and also a bunch of tall lilies in a broken jar. Mme Putois had attacked the basket of linen prepared by Gervaise, and Augustine was ironing her towels, with her nose in the air, deeply interested in a fly that was buzzing about.","Silence prevailed for a time. Nothing was to be heard except the soft thud of irons on the ironing pad. On both sides of the huge rectangular table Gervaise, her two employees, and the apprentice were bending over, slaving at their tasks with rounded shoulders, their arms moving incessantly. Each had a flat brick blackened by hot irons near her. A soup plate filled with clean water was on the middle of the table with a moistening rag and a small brush soaking in it. A bouquet of large white lilies bloomed in what had once been a brandied cherry jar. Its cluster of snowy flowers suggested a corner of a royal garden. Madame Putois had begun the basket that Gervaise had brought to her filled with towels, wrappers, cuffs and underdrawers. Augustine was dawdling with the stockings and washcloths, gazing into the air, seemingly fascinated by a large fly that was buzzing around. Clemence had done thirty-four men’s shirts so far that day."
"Maman Coupeau, qu'on croyait endormie, hocha la tête pour protester. Elle connaissait un autre moyen, infaillible celui-là. Il fallait manger un œuf dur toutes les deux heures et s'appliquer des feuilles d'épinard sur les reins. Les quatre autres femmes restèrent graves. Mais ce louchon d'Augustine, dont les gaietés partaient toutes seules, sans qu'on sût jamais pourquoi, lâcha le gloussement de poule qui était son rire à elle. On l'avait oubliée. Gervaise releva le jupon, l'aperçut sur le drap qui se roulait comme un goret, les jambes en l'air. Et elle la tira de là-dessous, la mit debout d'une claque. Qu'est-ce qu'elle avait à rire, cette dinde ? Est-ce qu'elle devait écouter, quand les grandes personnes causaient ! D'abord, elle allait reporter le linge d'une amie de madame Lerat, aux Batignolles. Tout en parlant, la patronne lui mettait le panier au bras et la poussait vers la porte. Le louchon, rechignant, sanglotant, s'éloigna en traînant les pieds dans la neige.","Maman Coupeau, who was thought to be asleep, shook her head in protest. She knew another way, infallible this one. You had to eat a hard-boiled egg every two hours and apply spinach leaves to your kidneys. The other four women remained serious. But that cross-eyed Augustine, whose gaiety went away on its own, without anyone ever knowing why, let out the chicken cluck that was her own laugh. We had forgotten her. Gervaise lifted the petticoat, saw it on the sheet rolling around like a piglet, legs in the air. And she pulled her from under there, slapped her up. What was she laughing at, this turkey? Did she have to listen when grown-ups were talking! First, she was going to take the laundry for a friend of Madame Lerat's to Batignolles. While talking, the landlady put the basket on her arm and pushed her towards the door. The squint, reluctant, sobbing, walked away dragging his feet in the snow.",Virginie suddenly stooped down to her hostess and said with a smile:,"Everyone thought mother Coupeau was asleep, but she shook her head in protest. She knew another way and it was infallible. You had to eat a hard-cooked egg every two hours, and put spinach leaves on your loins. Squint-eyed Augustine set up a hen-cackling when she heard this. They had forgotten about her. Gervaise lifted up the petticoat that was being ironed and found her rolling on the floor with laughter. She jerked her upright. What was she laughing about? Was it right for her to be eavesdropping when older people were talking, the little goose? Anyway it was time for her to deliver the laundry to a friend of Madame Lerat at Les Batignolles. So Gervaise hung a basket on her arm and pushed her toward the door. Augustine went off, sobbing and sniveling, dragging her feet in the snow."
"- Oui, ricana Lorilleux, le concierge vous attend encore.","- Yes, sneered Lorilleux, the concierge is still waiting for you.","The concierge is waiting to know what you mean to do.""","“Yes,” chuckled Lorilleux, “the landlord’s still waiting for you.”"
"- Vous savez bien, vous savez bien ? C'est votre sœur, je l'étranglerai, votre sœur ?","- You know well, you know well? She's your sister, I'll strangle her, your sister?","""You know very well—you know very well! Your sister—yes, I will strangle your sister!""","“You know well enough, you know well enough. It’s your sister. I’ll strangle her—your sister.”"
"Trou la la, trou la la,","Hole la la, hole la la,",Gervaise met his eyes and felt the very marrow of her bones chilled; she could not move hand or foot.,"“Trou la la, trou la la, Trou la, trou la,"
"Gervaise allait toujours, gambillant, remontant et redescendant avec la seule pensée de marcher sans cesse. Des somnolences la prenaient, elle s'endormait, bercée par sa jambe ; puis, elle regardait en sursaut autour d'elle, et elle s'apercevait qu'elle avait fait cent pas sans connaissance, comme morte. Ses pieds à dormir debout s'élargissaient dans ses savates trouées. Elle ne se sentait plus, tant elle était lasse et vide. La dernière idée nette qui l'occupât, fut que sa garce de fille, au même instant, mangeait peut-être des huîtres. Ensuite, tout se brouilla, elle resta les yeux ouverts, mais il lui fallait faire un trop grand effort pour penser. Et la seule sensation qui persistait en elle, au milieu de l'anéantissement de son être, était celle d'un froid de chien, d'un froid aigu et mortel comme jamais elle n'en avait éprouvé. Bien sûr, les morts n'ont pas si froid dans la terre. Elle souleva pesamment la tête, elle reçut au visage un cinglement glacial. C'était la neige qui se décidait enfin à tomber du ciel fumeux, une neige fine, drue, qu'un léger vent soufflait en tourbillons. Depuis trois jours, on l'attendait. Elle tombait au bon moment.","Gervaise was still going, gambolling, going up and down with the sole thought of walking incessantly. Drowsiness seized her, she fell asleep, rocked by her leg; then she looked around her with a start, and she noticed that she had walked a hundred paces unconscious, as if dead. His feet to sleep standing widened in his holey slippers. She no longer felt herself, she was so tired and empty. The last clear idea that occupied him was that his bitch of a daughter, at the same moment, was perhaps eating oysters. Then everything became blurred, she remained with her eyes open, but she had to make too great an effort to think. And the only sensation that persisted in her, in the midst of the annihilation of her being, was that of a dog's cold, a sharp and mortal cold such as she had never experienced. Of course, the dead are not so cold in the earth. She raised her head heavily, she received an icy sting in the face. It was the snow that finally decided to fall from the smoky sky, a fine, thick snow, which a light wind blew in whirlwinds. For three days, we had been waiting for him. She was falling at the right time.","Gervaise walked on, half asleep. She was conscious of little except that she was starving. She wondered where her daughter was and what she was eating, but it was too much trouble to think, and she shivered and crawled on. As she lifted her face she felt the cutting wind, accompanied by the snow, fine and dry, like gravel.","Gervaise still hobbled about, going up and down, with the idea of walking forever. At times, she felt drowsy and almost went to sleep, rocked, as it were, by her lame leg; then she looked round her with a start, and noticed she had walked a hundred yards unconsciously. Her feet were swelling in her ragged shoes. The last clear thought that occupied her mind was that her hussy of a daughter was perhaps eating oysters at that very moment. Then everything became cloudy; and, albeit, she remained with open eyes, it required too great an effort for her to think. The only sensation that remained to her, in her utter annihilation, was that it was frightfully cold, so sharply, mortally cold, she had never known the like before. Why, even dead people could not feel so cold in their graves. With an effort she raised her head, and something seemed to lash her face. It was the snow, which had at last decided to fall from the smoky sky—fine thick snow, which the breeze swept round and round. For three days it had been expected and what a splendid moment it chose to appear."
"Cependant, Nana, vers la fin de l'été, bouleversa la maison. Elle avait six ans, elle s'annonçait comme une vaurienne finie. Sa mère la menait chaque matin, pour ne pas la rencontrer toujours sous ses pieds, dans une petite pension de la rue Polonceau, chez mademoiselle Josse. Elle y attachait par-derrière les robes de ses camarades, elle emplissait de cendre la tabatière de la maîtresse, trouvait des inventions moins propres encore, qu'on ne pouvait pas raconter. Deux fois, mademoiselle Josse la mit à la porte, puis la reprit, pour ne pas perdre les six francs, chaque mois. Dès la sortie de la classe, Nana se vengeait d'avoir été enfermée, en faisant une vie d'enfer sous le porche et dans la cour, où les repasseuses, les oreilles cassées, lui disaient d'aller jouer. Elle retrouvait là Pauline, la fille des Boche, et le fils de l'ancienne patronne de Gervaise, Victor, un grand dadais de dix ans, qui adorait galopiner en compagnie des toutes petites filles. Madame Fauconnier, qui ne s'était pas fâchée avec les Coupeau, envoyait elle-même son fils.","However, Nana, towards the end of the summer, turned the house upside down. She was six years old, she announced herself as a finished scoundrel. Her mother took her every morning, so as not always to find her under her feet, to a little boarding house in the rue Polonceau, to Mademoiselle Josse's. She tied the dresses of her comrades to it behind, she filled the mistress's snuffbox with ashes, found inventions that were even less clean, that could not be told. Twice Mademoiselle Josse threw her out, then took her back, so as not to lose the six francs each month. As soon as she left class, Nana avenged herself for having been locked in, by making a life of hell under the porch and in the yard, where the ironers, her ears broken, told her to go and play. There she found Pauline, the daughter of the Boches, and the son of the former boss of Gervaise, Victor, a ten-year-old booby, who loved galloping in the company of very little girls. Madame Fauconnier, who had not been angry with the Coupeaus, sent her son herself.","Nana was now six years old and a most troublesome little sprite. Her mother took her every morning to a school in the Rue Polonçeau, to a certain Mlle Josse. Here she did all manner of mischief. She put ashes into the teacher's snuffbox, pinned the skirts of her companions together. Twice the young lady was sent home in disgrace and then taken back again for the sake of the six francs each month. As soon as school hours were over Nana revenged herself for the hours of enforced quiet she had passed by making the most frightful din in the courtyard and the shop. She found able allies in Pauline and Victor Boche.","Towards the end of the summer, Nana quite upset the household. She was six years old and promised to be a thorough good-for-nothing. So as not to have her always under her feet her mother took her every morning to a little school in the Rue Polonceau kept by Mademoiselle Josse. She fastened her playfellows’ dresses together behind, she filled the school-mistress’s snuff-box with ashes, and invented other tricks much less decent which could not be mentioned. Twice Mademoiselle Josse expelled her and then took her back again so as not to lose the six francs a month. Directly lessons were over Nana avenged herself for having been kept in by making an infernal noise under the porch and in the courtyard where the ironers, whose ears could not stand the racket, sent her to play. There she would meet Pauline, the Boches’ daughter, and Victor, the son of Gervaise’s old employer—a big booby of ten who delighted in playing with very little girls. Madame Fauconnier who had not quarreled with the Coupeaus would herself send her son."
"- Oh ! il est très doux, très gentil d'habitude, expliquait Coupeau. Je l'ai crânement élevé, vous verrez ? Il s'habituera à vous. Il faut qu'il connaisse les gens ? Enfin, quand il n'y aurait eu que ce petit, on ne pouvait pas rester toujours brouillé, n'est-ce pas ? Nous aurions dû faire ça pour lui il y a beaux jours, car je donnerais plutôt ma tête à couper que d'empêcher un père de voir son enfant.","- Oh ! he is very gentle, usually very kind, explained Coupeau. I raised him boldly, you'll see? He will get used to you. Does he have to know people? Finally, when there would have been only this little one, we couldn't always remain confused, could we? We should have done this for him a long time ago, because I'd rather give my head to be cut off than prevent a father from seeing his child.","""He is usually very good and very obedient,"" said Coupeau. ""I have brought him up well, as you will find out. He will soon get used to you. He must learn something of life, you see, and will understand one of these days that people must forget and forgive, and I would cut off my head sooner than prevent a father from seeing his child!""","he’s generally very gentle and nice,” exclaimed Coupeau. “I’ve brought him up properly, as you’ll see. He’ll get used to you. He must learn to know people. We can’t stay mad. We should have made up a long time ago for his sake. I’d rather have my head cut off than keep a father from seeing his own son.”"
"- Ah ! monsieur Goujet, monsieur Goujet ? murmurait-elle, sans trouver autre chose.","- Oh! Mr. Goujet, Mr. Goujet? she murmured, without finding anything else.","""Ah, Monsieur Goujet!"" she murmured, but she could say no more.",“Don’t you see?” he said.
Que des grands arbres et du vent.,Only tall trees and wind.,"The other guests saw nothing, so entirely absorbed were they in the touching words which Mme Lerat was still singing.",It sounded like a moaning wail of the wind and Madame Putois was so moved that she spilled her wine over the table.
"Virginie, renversée avec un air de princesse, les yeux demi-clos, suivait toujours le lavage, lâchait des réflexions.","Virginie, thrown back with the air of a princess, her eyes half-closed, was still following the wash, uttering thoughts.","Virginie, leaning back in her chair with the air of a princess, followed the progress of the work with half-closed eyes.","Virginie, who sat back with the demeanor of a princess, her eyes partly open, was still watching the scrubbing, and indulging in remarks."
"Elle accusait très carrément Gervaise de coucher avec Goujet. Elle mentait, elle prétendait les avoir surpris un soir ensemble, sur un banc du boulevard extérieur. La pensée de cette liaison, des plaisirs que devait goûter sa belle-sœur, l'exaspérait davantage, dans son honnêteté de femme laide. Chaque jour, le cri de son cœur lui revenait aux lèvres :","She very bluntly accused Gervaise of sleeping with Goujet. She was lying, she claimed to have caught them one evening together, on a bench on the outside boulevard. The thought of this liaison, of the pleasures that her sister-in-law was to enjoy, exasperated her even more, in her honesty as an ugly woman. Every day, the cry of his heart returned to his lips:",""" And she went on to intimate that Gervaise and Goujet were altogether too intimate. This was the groundwork of many fables; she said Wooden Legs was so mild and sweet that she had deceived her to the extent that she had consented to become Nana's godmother, which had been no small expense, but now things were very different.","She bluntly accused Gervaise of flirting with Goujet. She lied —she pretended she had surprised them together one night on a seat on the exterior Boulevards. The thought of this liaison, of pleasures that her sister-in-law was no doubt enjoying, exasperated her still more, because of her own ugly woman’s strict sense of propriety. Every day the same cry came from her heart to her lips."
"- Oh ! je n'attaque pas votre travail, vous travaillez dans la perfection, je le sais, dit madame Goujet. Ainsi, voilà un bonnet qui est perlé. Il n'y a que vous pour faire ressortir les broderies comme ça. Et les tuyautés sont d'un suivi ! Allez, je reconnais votre main tout de suite. Quand vous donnez seulement un torchon à une ouvrière, ça se voit ? N'est-ce pas ? vous mettrez un peu moins d'amidon, voilà tout ! Goujet ne tient pas à avoir l'air d'un monsieur.","- Oh ! I'm not attacking your work, you work to perfection, I know that, said Madame Goujet. So, here is a cap that is beaded. Only you can make embroideries like this stand out. And the tips are a follow-up! Come on, I recognize your hand right away. When you only give a rag to a worker, does it show? Is not it ? you will put a little less starch, that's all! Goujet does not want to look like a gentleman.","""I have no intention of disparaging your work,"" answered Mme Goujet. ""I never saw anyone who did up laces and embroideries as you do, and the fluting is simply perfect; the only trouble is a little too much starch, my dear. Goujet does not care to look like a fine gentleman.""","“Oh! I’m not complaining of your work; I know it’s perfection,” said Madame Goujet. “For instance, you’ve done this cap splendidly, only you could bring out the embroidery like that. And the flutings are all so even. Oh! I recognize your hand at once. When you give even a dish-cloth to one of your workwomen I detect it at once. In future, use a little less starch, that’s all! Goujet does not care to look like a stylish gentleman.”"
"Et elle avait, en parlant, une si belle figure, toute pleine de franchise, qu'il lui prit la main et la fit rasseoir. Maintenant, il respirait à l'aise, il riait en dedans. C'était la première fois qu'il lui tenait la main et qu'il la serrait dans la sienne. Tous deux restèrent muets. Au ciel, le vol de nuages blancs nageait avec une lenteur de cygne. Dans le coin du champ, la chèvre, tournée vers eux, les regardait en poussant à de longs intervalles réguliers un bêlement très doux. Et, sans se lâcher les doigts, les yeux noyés d'attendrissement, ils se perdaient au loin, sur la pente de Montmartre blafard, au milieu de la haute futaie des cheminées d'usine rayant l'horizon, dans cette banlieue plâtreuse et désolée, où les bosquets verts des cabarets borgnes les touchaient jusqu'aux larmes.","And she had, as she spoke, such a beautiful face, full of frankness, that he took her hand and made her sit down. Now he was breathing easily, he was laughing inside. It was the first time he had held her hand and squeezed it in his own. Both remained silent. In the sky, the flight of white clouds swam with the slowness of a swan. In the corner of the field, the goat, turned towards them, looked at them, uttering at long regular intervals a very soft bleat. And, without letting go of their fingers, their eyes drowned in tenderness, they lost themselves in the distance, on the slope of pale Montmartre, in the middle of the high forest of factory chimneys streaking the horizon, in this plastery and desolate suburb. , where the green groves of one-eyed cabarets touched them to tears.","Her face was so honest, her eyes were so clear and frank, that he could do no less than believe her. Once more he breathed freely. He held her hand for the first time. Both were silent. White clouds sailed slowly above their heads with the majesty of swans. The goat looked at them and bleated piteously, eager to be released, and they stood hand in hand on that bleak slope with tears in their eyes.","She seemed so sincere that he took her hand and made her sit down again. He could breathe freely; his heart rejoiced. This was the first time he had ever held her hand like this. He pressed it in his own and they both sat quietly for a time. “I know your mother doesn’t like me,” Gervaise said in a low voice."

Il a mal à la patte.,His leg hurts.,The children were laughing in the courtyard and Nana singing loudly.,She was giving commands in her shrill voice and the children were singing a song about a donkey.
"Le nouveau logement des Coupeau se trouvait au sixième, escalier B. Quand on avait passé devant mademoiselle Remanjou, on prenait le corridor, à gauche. Puis, il fallait encore tourner. La première porte était celle des Bijard. Presque en face, dans un trou sans air, sous un petit escalier qui montait à la toiture, couchait le père Bru. Deux logements plus loin, on arrivait chez Bazouge. Enfin, contre Bazouge, c'étaient les Coupeau, une chambre et un cabinet donnant sur la cour. Et il n'y avait plus, au fond du couloir, que deux ménages, avant d'être chez les Lorilleux, tout au bout.","The Coupeaus' new lodgings were on the sixth floor, staircase B. When they had passed Mademoiselle Remanjou, they took the corridor on the left. Then, it was still necessary to turn. The first gate was that of the Bijards. Almost opposite, in an airless hole, under a little staircase that went up to the roof, Father Bru slept. Two apartments further, we arrived at Bazouge. Finally, against Bazouge, it was the Coupeaus, a bedroom and a study overlooking the courtyard. And there were only two households left at the end of the corridor, before reaching the Lorilleux's, at the very end.","DISASTERS AND CHANGES The new lodging of the Coupeaus was next that of the Bijards. Almost opposite their door was a closet under the stairs which went up to the roof—a mere hole without light or ventilation, where Father Bru slept. A chamber and a small room, about as large as one's hand, were all the Coupeaus had now.","The Coupeaus’ new lodging was on the sixth floor, staircase B. After passing Mademoiselle Remanjou’s door, you took the corridor to the left, and then turned again further along. The first door was for the apartment of the Bijards. Almost opposite, in an airless corner under a small staircase leading to the roof, was where Pere Bru slept. Two doors further was Bazouge’s room and the Coupeaus were opposite him, overlooking the court, with one room and a closet. There were only two more doors along the corridor before reaching that of the Lorilleuxs at the far end."
"Mais comme la laveuse se lamentait, craignant de ne pouvoir mettre couler le jour même, elle voulut bien lui donner le linge sale tout de suite. Elles allèrent chercher les paquets dans la pièce de gauche où couchait Etienne, et revinrent avec des brassées énormes, qu'elles empilèrent sur le carreau, au fond de la boutique. Le triage dura une grosse demi-heure. Gervaise faisait des tas autour d'elle, jetait ensemble les chemises d'homme, les chemises de femme, les mouchoirs, les chaussettes, les torchons. Quand une pièce d'un nouveau client lui passait entre les mains, elle la marquait d'une croix au fil rouge, pour la reconnaître. Dans l'air chaud, une puanteur fade montait de tout ce linge sale remué.","But as the washer lamented, fearing she wouldn't be able to run the laundry the same day, she was good enough to give him the dirty laundry right away. They went to fetch the parcels in the room on the left where Etienne slept, and came back with enormous armfuls, which they piled on the floor at the back of the shop. The sorting lasted a good half hour. Gervaise was making heaps around her, throwing together men's shirts, women's shirts, handkerchiefs, socks, tea towels. When a piece from a new client passed through her hands, she marked it with a cross on the red thread, to recognize it. In the warm air, a bland stench rose from all the dirty laundry stirred up.",""" At the same time, however, Gervaise amiably laid down her work and went for the dirty clothes, which she piled up in the back shop.","But as the washerwoman began lamenting and fearing that she would not be able to put all the things to soak that day, she consented to give her the dirty clothes at once. They went to fetch the bundles in the left hand room where Etienne slept, and returned with enormous armfuls which they piled up on the floor at the back of the shop. The sorting lasted a good half hour. Gervaise made heaps all round her, throwing the shirts in one, the chemises in another, the handkerchiefs, the socks, the dish-cloths in others. Whenever she came across anything belonging to a new customer, she marked it with a cross in red cotton thread so as to know it again. And from all this dirty linen which they were throwing about there issued an offensive odor in the warm atmosphere."
"- Sapristi, vous êtes joliment bien, tout de même !","- Holy shit, you're pretty well, all the same!","Finally one night when he had uttered this phrase, as usual, Coupeau cried out:",“By Jove! you are comfortably situated here.”
"Gervaise, pâlissant, avait joint les mains. Mais lui, continuait :","Gervaise, turning pale, had clasped her hands. But he continued:","Gervaise clasped her hands imploringly, and he continued:",Gervaise turned pale and clasped her hands as he continued:
"Un joli ventrouilloire,","A pretty ventrouillon,","Then Mme Lorilleux fell to crying, and Lantier had great trouble in preventing her from going away at once, and the quarrel grew so violent that Mme Lerat hastily closed the door of the room where the dead woman lay, as if she feared the noise would waken her.","Just at this moment the girls playing in the courtyard, led by Nana, began singing again."
"Elle bégayait, elle ne pouvait plus prononcer les mots. Lorsqu'elle empoigna la fourchette, elle tremblait tellement qu'elle la laissa retomber. La faim qui l'étranglait lui donnait un branle sénile de la tête. Elle dut prendre avec les doigts. A la première pomme de terre qu'elle se fourra dans la bouche, elle éclata en sanglots. De grosses larmes roulaient le long de ses joues, tombaient sur son pain. Elle mangeait toujours, elle dévorait goulûment son pain trempé de ses larmes, soufflant très fort, le menton convulsé. Goujet la força à boire, pour qu'elle n'étouffât pas ; et son verre eut un petit claquement contre ses dents.","She was stuttering, she couldn't pronounce the words. When she grabbed the fork, she was shaking so much she let it fall. The hunger that strangled him gave him a senile shake of the head. She had to take it with her fingers. At the first potato she stuffed into her mouth, she burst into tears. Big tears were rolling down her cheeks, falling on her bread. She was still eating, she greedily devoured her tear-soaked bread, breathing very hard, her chin convulsing. Goujet forced her to drink so that she would not choke; and his glass clicked softly against his teeth.","She trembled to that degree that she could hardly hold her fork. Hunger gave her eyes the fierceness of a famished beast and to her head the tremulous motion of senility. After eating a potato she burst into tears but continued to eat, with the tears streaming down her cheeks and her chin quivering.","She stammered; she could hardly articulate. When she caught hold of her fork she began to tremble so acutely that she let it fall again. The hunger that possessed her made her wag her head as if senile. She carried the food to her mouth with her fingers. As she stuffed the first potato into her mouth, she burst out sobbing. Big tears coursed down her cheeks and fell onto her bread. She still ate, gluttonously devouring this bread thus moistened by her tears, and breathing very hard all the while. Goujet compelled her to drink to prevent her from stifling, and her glass chinked, as it were, against her teeth."
"Cependant, au bout d'un silence, Lantier qui s'ennuyait haussa la voix.","However, after a silence, Lantier, who was bored, raised his voice.",After this she had only to rinse the floor after sweeping the dirty water into the gutter.,"After a pause, Lantier, who felt bored, raised his voice again: “Do you know, Badingue,” he cried, “I met your boss yesterday in the Rue de Rivoli."
"En effet, un léger miaulement, parfaitement imité, semblait sortir du plat. C'était Coupeau, qui faisait ça avec la gorge, sans remuer les lèvres ; un talent de société d'un succès certain, si bien qu'il ne mangeait jamais dehors sans commander une gibelotte. Ensuite, il ronronna. Les dames se tamponnaient la figure avec leurs serviettes, parce quelles riaient trop.","Indeed, a slight mewing, perfectly imitated, seemed to come out of the dish. It was Coupeau, who did that with his throat, without moving his lips; a social talent of certain success, so much so that he never ate out without ordering a gibelotte. Then he purred. The ladies dabbed their faces with their napkins, because they were laughing too much.","And the low mewing of a cat seemed, indeed, to come from the dish. This delicate joke was perpetrated by Coupeau in the throat, without the smallest movement of his lips. This feat always met with such success that he never ordered a meal anywhere without a rabbit stew. The ladies wiped their eyes with their napkins because they laughed so much.","And in fact, a faint mew perfectly imitated seemed to issue from the dish. It was Coupeau who did that with his throat, without opening his lips; a talent which at all parties, met with decided success, so much so that he never ordered a dinner abroad without having a rabbit ragout. After that he purred. The ladies pressed their napkins to their mouths to try and stop their laughter."
"Puis, il se leva sur un coude, demandant :","Then he raised himself on one elbow, asking:","""She is dead,"" she said.",Then he raised himself on his elbow and asked:
"Gervaise, très sérieuse, regardait sa fille, les yeux grands ouverts, lentement assombris d'une tristesse. Elle hocha la tête ; elle aurait voulu un garçon, parce que les garçons se débrouillent toujours et ne courent pas tant de risques, dans ce Paris. La sage-femme dut enlever le poupon des mains de Coupeau. Elle défendit aussi à Gervaise de parler ; c'était déjà mauvais qu'on fît tant de bruit autour d'elle. Alors, le zingueur dit qu'il fallait prévenir maman Coupeau et les Lorilleux ; mais il crevait de faim, il voulait dîner auparavant. Ce fut un gros ennui pour l'accouchée de le voir se servir lui-même, courir à la cuisine chercher le ragoût, manger dans une assiette creuse, ne pas trouver le pain. Malgré la défense, elle se lamentait, se tournait entre les draps. Aussi, c'était bien bête de n'avoir pas pu mettre la table ; la colique l'avait assise par terre comme un coup de bâton. Son pauvre homme lui en voudrait, d'être là à se dorloter, quand il mangeait si mal. Les pommes de terre étaient-elles assez cuites au moins ? Elle ne se rappelait plus si elle les avait salées.","Gervaise, very serious, looked at her daughter, her eyes wide open, slowly darkened with sadness. She nodded; she would have liked a boy, because boys always manage and don't run so many risks in this Paris. The midwife had to remove the doll from Coupeau's hands. She also forbade Gervaise to speak; it was bad enough that so much noise was being made around her. So the zinc worker said he had to warn Maman Coupeau and the Lorilleux; but he was starving, he wanted to have dinner first. It was a great annoyance for the mother to see him serving himself, running to the kitchen to get the stew, eating from a soup plate, not finding the bread. Despite the defense, she lamented, tossing and turning between the sheets. Also, it was very stupid not to have been able to set the table; the colic had seated her on the ground like the blow of a stick. Her poor man would resent her for being there pampering himself when he ate so badly. Were the potatoes cooked enough at least? She couldn't remember if she had salted them.","Gervaise, with a faint smile and sad eyes, looked at her daughter. She shook her head. She would have preferred a boy, because boys run less risks in a place like Paris. The nurse took the baby from the father's hands and told Gervaise she must not talk. Coupeau said he must go and tell his mother and sister the news, but he was famished and must eat something first. His wife was greatly disturbed at seeing him wait upon himself, and she tossed about a little and complained that she could not make him comfortable.","Gervaise looked at her daughter very seriously, with wide open eyes, slowly overshadowed with sadness, for she would rather have had a boy. Boys can talk care of themselves and don’t have to run such risks on the streets of Paris as girls do. The midwife took the infant from Coupeau. She forbade Gervaise to do any talking; it was bad enough there was so much noise around her. Then the zinc-worker said that he must tell the news to mother Coupeau and the Lorilleuxs, but he was dying with hunger, he must first of all have his dinner. It was a great worry to the invalid to see him have to wait on himself, run to the kitchen for the stew, eat it out of a soup plate, and not be able to find the bread. In spite of being told not to do so, she bewailed her condition, and fidgeted about in her bed. It was stupid of her not to have managed to set the cloth, the pains had laid her on her back like a blow from a bludgeon. Her poor old man would not think it kind of her to be nursing herself up there whilst he was dining so badly. At least were the potatoes cooked enough? She no longer remembered whether she had put salt in them."
- Comment ? comment ? bégaya la mère.,- How ? How? 'Or' What ? stammered the mother.,"Why can't I do the same?"" ""What do you mean?"" stammered the mother.",“What! What!” stammered the mother.
"Gervaise venait de poser le bonnet de madame Boche sur un champignon garni d'un linge, et en tuyautait les dentelles minutieusement au petit fer. Elle leva les yeux juste au moment où le zingueur envoyait encore les mains, fouillant dans la chemise.","Gervaise had just placed Madame Boche's bonnet on a mushroom topped with linen, and was trimming the lace minutely with a small iron. She looked up just as the zinc worker sent his hands again, rummaging through the shirt.",Gervaise undressed her husband and tucked him up in bed as if he had been a child and then returned to her fluting irons in time to still a grand dispute that was going on about an iron that had not been properly cleaned.,Gervaise glanced over just as her husband’s hands began to explore inside the chemise.
"Faites donc le tour avec moi, passez par la rue de la Goutte-d'Or, ça ne vous allonge guère ? Il faut que j'aille chez ma sœur, avant de retourner au chantier ? Nous nous accompagnerons.","Take the tour with me, take the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or, doesn't that make you long? Do I have to go to my sister's before returning to the construction site? We will accompany each other.","""Go a little way with me. It will not be much farther for you. I must stop at my sister's before I go back to the shop."" She yielded to his entreaties, and they walked slowly on together.",It’s not much farther for you. I’ve got to see my sister before going back to work. We’ll keep each other company.”
"Alors, elle-même voulut rire et leur montrer combien elle sacrifiait volontiers l'argent pour la guérison de son mari. Chaque fois qu'elle prenait en leur présence le livret de la Caisse d'épargne, sous le globe de la pendule, elle disait gaiement :","So she herself wanted to laugh and show them how willingly she sacrificed money for the healing of her husband. Each time she took the Caisse d'Epargne passbook from under the globe of the clock in their presence, she said cheerfully:","She tried to laugh and to show them she did not grudge the money that had been expended in the restoration of her husband's health. She did not withdraw all her savings from the bank at once, for she had a vague hope that some miracle would intervene which would render the sacrifice unnecessary.","Then she also wished to laugh, and show them how willingly she parted with the money for the sake of curing her husband. Each time she took the savings-bank book from beneath the glass clock-tower in their presence, she would say gaily:"
"Et, grande, masculine, avec son nez osseux et ses épaules carrées de gendarme, elle commença :","And, tall, masculine, with her bony nose and square policeman's shoulders, she began:","She stood up, with her square shoulders like those of a man, and began:","And, tall and masculine-looking, with her bony nose and her shoulders as square as a grenadier’s she began:"
"Le vrai était que Gervaise aurait mieux aimé qu'on ne parlât pas de batteries de femmes. Ça l'ennuyait, à cause de la fessée du lavoir, quand on causait devant elle et Virginie de coups de sabot dans les quilles et de giroflées à cinq feuilles. Justement, Virginie la regardait en souriant.","The truth was that Gervaise would have preferred not to talk about batteries of women. It bothered her, because of the spanking in the washhouse, when we talked in front of her and Virginie about kicking the skittles and wallflowers. As it happened, Virginie looked at her with a smile.",Virginie suddenly stooped down to her hostess and said with a smile:,"The truth was that Gervaise did not like this talk about women fighting. Because of the flogging at the wash-house it annoyed her whenever anyone spoke before her and Virginie of kicks with wooden shoes and of slaps in the face. It so happened, too, that Virginie was looking at her and smiling."
"Le samedi suivant, Coupeau, qui n'était pas rentré dîner, amena Lantier vers dix heures. Ils avaient mangé ensemble des pieds de mouton, chez Thomas, à Montmartre.","The following Saturday, Coupeau, who had not returned to dinner, brought Lantier around ten o'clock. They had eaten mutton's feet together, at Thomas's, in Montmartre.","The following Saturday Coupeau, who had not been home to dinner, came in with Lantier about ten o'clock. They had been eating pigs' feet at a restaurant at Montmarte.","On the following Saturday Coupeau, who had not come home to dinner, brought Lantier with him towards ten o’clock. They had had some sheep’s trotters at Chez Thomas at Montmartre."
"Le dimanche seulement, Gervaise put se rendre à Sainte-Anne. C'était un vrai voyage. Heureusement, l'omnibus du boulevard Rochechouart à la Glacière passait près de l'asile. Elle descendit rue de la Santé, elle acheta deux oranges pour ne pas entrer les mains vides. Encore un monument, avec des cours grises, des corridors interminables, une odeur de vieux remèdes rances, qui n'inspirait pas précisément la gaieté. Mais, quand on l'eut fait entrer dans une cellule, elle fut toute surprise de voir Coupeau presque gaillard. Il était justement sur le trône, une caisse de bois très propre, qui ne répandait pas la moindre odeur ; et ils rirent de ce qu'elle le trouvait en fonction, son trou de balle au grand air. N'est-ce pas ? on sait bien ce que c'est qu'un malade. Il se carrait là-dessus comme un pape, avec son bagou d'autrefois. Oh ! il allait mieux, puisque ça reprenait son cours.","Only on Sundays was Gervaise able to go to Sainte-Anne. It was a real trip. Fortunately, the omnibus from Boulevard Rochechouart to La Glacière passed close to the asylum. She went down rue de la Sante, she bought two oranges so as not to come in empty-handed. Another monument, with gray courtyards, endless corridors, an odor of old rancid remedies, which did not exactly inspire cheerfulness. But, when they had brought her into a cell, she was quite surprised to see Coupeau almost a jolly man. He was just sitting on the throne, a very clean wooden crate that didn't give off the slightest odor; and they laughed at her finding him on duty, his asshole out in the open. Is not it ? we know well what a sick person is. He squared off about it like a pope, with his old-time glibness. Oh ! he was better, since things were starting to run again.","On Sunday only could Gervaise go to Sainte-Anne. It was a long distance off. Fortunately there was an omnibus which went very near. She got out at La Rue Sante and bought two oranges that she might not go quite empty-handed. But when she went in, to her astonishment she found Coupeau sitting up. He welcomed her gaily. ""You are better!""","Gervaise was not able to go to Sainte-Anne until Sunday. It was a tremendous journey. Fortunately, the omnibus from the Boulevard Rochechouart to La Glaciere passed close to the asylum. She went down the Rue de la Sante, buying two oranges on her way, so as not to arrive empty-handed. It was another monumental building, with grey courtyards, interminable corridors and a smell of rank medicaments, which did not exactly inspire liveliness. But when they had admitted her into a cell she was quite surprised to see Coupeau almost jolly. He was just then seated on the throne, a spotlessly clean wooden case, and they both laughed at her finding him in this position. Well, one knows what an invalid is. He squatted there like a pope with his cheek of earlier days. Oh! he was better, as he could do this."
"Ce jour-là, il devait justement poser les dernières feuilles de zinc. Comme le toit était presque plat, il y avait installé son établi, un large volet sur deux tréteaux. Un beau soleil de mai se couchait, dorant les cheminées. Et, tout là-haut, dans le ciel clair, l'ouvrier taillait tranquillement son zinc à coups de cisaille, penché sur l'établi, pareil à un tailleur coupant chez lui une paire de culottes. Contre le mur de la maison voisine, son aide, un gamin de dix-sept ans, fluet et blond, entretenait le feu du réchaud en manœuvrant un énorme soufflet, dont chaque haleine faisait envoler un pétillement d'étincelles.","That day, he was to lay the last sheets of zinc. As the roof was almost flat, he had set up his workbench there, a large shutter on two trestles. A beautiful May sun was setting, gilding the chimneys. And, up there, in the clear sky, the workman was quietly cutting his zinc with shears, leaning over the workbench, like a tailor cutting a pair of breeches at home. Against the wall of the house next door, his assistant, a boy of seventeen, slender and fair-haired, was keeping up the fire on the stove by operating an enormous bellows, each breath of which sent off a crackle of sparks.","Coupeau was then completing the roof of a three-storied house and was laying the very last sheets of zinc. It was May and a cloudless evening. The sun was low in the horizon, and against the blue sky the figure of Coupeau was clearly defined as he cut his zinc as quietly as a tailor might have cut out a pair of breeches in his workshop. His assistant, a lad of seventeen, was blowing up the furnace with a pair of bellows, and at each puff a great cloud of sparks arose.","It so happened that on that day he was to fix the last sheets of zinc. As the roof was almost flat, he had set up his bench on it, a wide shutter supported on two trestles. A beautiful May sun was setting, giving a golden hue to the chimney-pots. And, right up at the top, against the clear sky, the workman was quietly cutting up his zinc with a big pair of shears, leaning over the bench, and looking like a tailor in his shop cutting out a pair of trousers. Close to the wall of the next house, his boy, a youngster of seventeen, thin and fair, was keeping the fire of the chafing dish blazing by the aid of an enormous pair of bellows, each puff of which raised a cloud of sparks."
"Gervaise, prise brusquement d'une grande répugnance, s'était reculée.","Gervaise, suddenly seized with great repugnance, had drawn back.",Gervaise was seated with these piles of soiled linen about her.,"Gervaise, suddenly seized with a great repugnance, drew back."
"Ce fut cette année-là, en juin, que Nana fit sa première communion. Elle allait sur ses treize ans, grande déjà comme une asperge montée, avec un air d'effronterie ; l'année précédente, on l'avait renvoyée du catéchisme, à cause de sa mauvaise conduite ; et, si le curé l'admettait cette fois, c'était de peur de ne pas la voir revenir et de lâcher sur le pavé une païenne de plus. Nana dansait de joie en pensant à la robe blanche. Les Lorilleux, comme parrain et marraine, avaient promis la robe, un cadeau dont ils parlaient dans toute la maison ; madame Lerat devait donner le voile et le bonnet, Virginie la bourse, Lantier le paroissien ; de façon que les Coupeau attendaient la cérémonie sans trop s'inquiéter. Même les Poisson, qui voulaient pendre la crémaillère, choisirent justement cette occasion, sans doute sur le conseil du chapelier. Ils invitèrent les Coupeau et les Boche, dont la petite faisait aussi sa première communion. Le soir, on mangerait chez eux un gigot et quelque chose autour.","It was that year, in June, that Nana made her first communion. She was going on her thirteenth birthday, already as tall as an asparagus, with an air of effrontery; the previous year she had been expelled from catechism because of her bad behavior; and, if the priest admitted it this time, it was for fear of not seeing her return and of letting another heathen out on the pavement. Nana danced with joy thinking of the white dress. The Lorilleuxs, as godfather and godmother, had promised the dress, a present they talked about throughout the house; Madame Lerat was to give the veil and the bonnet, Virginie the purse, Lantier the parishioner; so that the Coupeaus awaited the ceremony without worrying too much. Even the Poissons, who wanted to have a housewarming party, chose precisely this occasion, no doubt on the advice of the hatter. They invited the Coupeaus and the Boches, whose little one was also making her first communion. In the evening, we would eat a lamb and something around them.","It was in June of this year that Nana partook of her first Communion. She was about thirteen, slender and tall as an asparagus plant, and her air and manner were the height of impertinence and audacity. She had been sent away from the catechism class the year before on account of her bad conduct. And if the cure did not make a similar objection this year it was because he feared she would never come again and that his refusal would launch on the Parisian pavé another castaway. Nana danced with joy at the mere thought of what the Lorilleuxs—as her godparents—had promised, while Mme Lerat gave the veil and cup, Virginie the purse and Lantier a prayer book, so that the Coupeaus looked forward to the day without anxiety. The Poissons—probably through Lantier's advice—selected this occasion for their housewarming. They invited the Coupeaus and the Boche family, as Pauline made her first Communion on that day, as well as Nana. The evening before, while Nana stood in an ecstasy of delight before her presents, her father came in in an abominable condition.","It was in June of that year that Nana was confirmed. She was then nearly thirteen years old, as tall as an asparagus shoot run to seed, and had a bold, impudent air about her. The year before she had been sent away from the catechism class on account of her bad behavior; and the priest had only allowed her to join it this time through fear of losing her altogether, and of casting one more heathen onto the street. Nana danced for joy as she thought of the white dress. The Lorilleuxs, being godfather and godmother, had promised to provide it, and took care to let everyone in the house know of their present. Madame Lerat was to give the veil and the cap, Virginie the purse, and Lantier the prayer-book; so that the Coupeaus looked forward to the ceremony without any great anxiety. Even the Poissons, wishing to give a house-warming, chose this occasion, no doubt on the hatter’s advice. They invited the Coupeaus and the Boches, whose little girl was also going to be confirmed. They provided a leg of mutton and trimmings for the evening in question."
"Elle n'osa pourtant pas demander qu'on lui répétât la saleté de Sophie, malgré son envie furieuse de la connaître. Mais, pendant un instant, le nez baissé, faisant de la dignité, elle se régala de la conversation des ouvrières. Une d'elles ne pouvait lâcher un mot, le mot le plus innocent, à propos de son ouvrage par exemple, sans qu'aussitôt les autres n'y entendissent malice ; elles détournaient le mot de son sens, lui donnaient une signification cochonne, mettaient des allusions extraordinaires sous des paroles simples comme celles-ci : « Ma pince est fendue », ou bien : « Qui est-ce qui a fouillé dans mon petit pot ? » Et elles rapportaient tout au monsieur qui faisait le pied de grue en face, c'était le monsieur qui arrivait quand même au bout des allusions. Ah ! les oreilles devaient lui corner ! Elles finissaient par dire des choses très bêtes, tant elles voulaient être malignes. Mais ça ne les empêchait pas de trouver ce jeu-là bien amusant, excitées, les yeux fous, allant de plus fort en plus fort. Madame Lerat n'avait pas à se fâcher, on ne disait rien de cru. Elle-même les fit toutes se rouler, en demandant :","Yet she didn't dare ask for Sophie's filth to be repeated to her, despite her furious desire to know her. But, for a moment, her nose lowered, showing dignity, she delighted in the conversation of the workers. One of them couldn't utter a word, the most innocent word, about her work, for example, without the others immediately hearing it malicious; they divert the word from its meaning, give it a dirty meaning, put extraordinary allusions under simple words like these: ""My pliers are split"", or else: ""Who rummaged in my little pot?"" And they related everything to the gentleman who was crawling across the way, it was the gentleman who came all the same to the end of the allusions. Ah! the ears had to corner him! They ended up saying very stupid things, so much they wanted to be clever. But that didn't prevent them from finding this game very amusing, excited, wild-eyed, going louder and louder. Madame Lerat had nothing to get angry about, no one was saying anything crude. She herself made them all roll over, asking:",Nana listened to the conversation which followed—reveling in indecency—as much at home in it as a fish is in water.,"She did not dare go so far as to ask them to pass Sophie’s remark on to her although she burned to hear it. So she kept her eyes on her work, amusing herself by listening to the conversation. Now no one could make even an innocent remark without the others twisting it around and connecting it with the gentleman on the sidewalk. Madame Lerat herself once sent them into convulsions of laughter when she said, “Mademoiselle Lisa, my fire’s gone out."
"Coupeau, attendri, répétait :","Coupeau, moved, repeated:","Coupeau listened quietly, saying only at intervals:",Coupeau was deeply moved and kept repeating: “I feel so sorry for you.
"Cependant, Coupeau ne reparaissait plus. On l'entendait, dans la cuisine, se battre avec le fourneau et la cafetière. Gervaise se tournait les sangs ; ce n'était pas l'occupation d'un homme, de faire du café ; et elle lui criait comment il devait s'y prendre, sans écouter les chut ! énergiques de la sage-femme.","However, Coupeau did not reappear. You could hear him, in the kitchen, struggling with the stove and the coffeepot. Gervaise was soured; it was not a man's occupation to make coffee; and she shouted to him how he should go about it, without listening to the shhs! energy of the midwife.","Meanwhile Coupeau was heard banging round in the kitchen, and his wife nervously called out to him and told him where the things were that he wanted, but her husband rose superior to all difficulties and soon appeared with the smoking coffeepot, and they all seated themselves around the table, except the nurse, who drank a cup standing and then departed; all was going well, and she was not needed.","Certainly there were no eyes like that in the Coupeau family. Coupeau, however, had failed to reappear. One could hear him in the kitchen struggling with the grate and the coffee-pot. Gervaise was worrying herself frightfully; it was not the proper thing for a man to make coffee; and she called and told him what to do, without listening to the midwife’s energetic “hush!”"

A son killed his father with a spade to steal thirty sous? »,"Lantier did not reply instantly, but presently, as the others emptied their glasses, he began to read aloud an account of a frightful murder, to which they listened with eager interest.","“A frightful crime has just spread consternation throughout the Commune of Gaillon, Department of Seine-et-Marne.

"Il y eut un silence. Cette vaurienne de Clémence, qui dans les bastringues, menait le chahut avec des cris de merluche, attristait toujours le monde par ses idées de crevaison, quand elle était à l'atelier. Gervaise la connaissait bien et se contenta de dire :","There was a silence. This rascal Clemence, who in the bastringues, led the ruckus with cries of hake, always saddened the world by her ideas of punctures, when she was in the workshop. Gervaise knew her well and contented herself with saying:",Virginie suddenly stooped down to her hostess and said with a smile:,"A short silence ensued. The good-for-nothing Clemence, who led riots in low dancing establishments, and shrieked like a screech-owl at work, always saddened everyone with her thoughts of death. Gervaise knew her well, and so merely said:"
"Mais il lui fallut pourtant accepter l'aide de la concierge. Elles tordaient toutes deux, chacune à un bout, une jupe, un petit lainage marron mauvais teint, d'où sortait une eau jaunâtre, lorsque madame Boche s'écria :","But he still had to accept the concierge's help. They were both twisting, each at one end, a skirt, a little badly dyed brown woolen cloth, from which came a yellowish water, when Madame Boche exclaimed:","Nevertheless, she accepted the aid of the concierge.

"Bibi-la-Grillade se leva pour aller lui chercher un verre d'anisette. Elle approcha sa chaise, elle s'attabla. Pendant qu'elle sirotait son anisette, elle eut tout d'un coup un souvenir, elle se rappela la prune qu'elle avait mangée avec Coupeau, jadis, près de la porte, lorsqu'il lui faisait la cour. En ce temps-là, elle laissait la sauce des fruits à l'eau-de-vie. Et, maintenant, voici qu'elle se remettait aux liqueurs. Oh ! elle se connaissait, elle n'avait pas pour deux liards de volonté. On n'aurait eu qu'à lui donner une chiquenaude sur les reins pour l'envoyer faire une culbute dans la boisson. Même ça lui semblait très bon, l'anisette, peut-être un peu trop doux, un peu écœurant. Et elle suçait son verre, en écoutant Bec-Salé, dit Boit-sans-Soif, raconter sa liaison avec la grosse Eulalie, celle qui vendait du poisson dans la rue, une femme rudement maligne, une particulière qui le flairait chez les marchands de vin, tout en poussant sa voiture, le long des trottoirs ; les camarades avaient beau l'avertir et le cacher, elle le pinçait souvent, elle lui avait même, la veille, envoyé une limande par la figure, pour lui apprendre à manquer l'atelier. Par exemple, ça, c'était drôle. Bibi-la-Grillade et Mes-Bottes, les côtes crevées de rire, appliquaient des claques sur les épaules de Gervaise, qui rigolait enfin, comme chatouillée et malgré elle ; et ils lui conseillaient d'imiter la grosse Eulalie, d'apporter ses fers et de repasser les oreilles de Coupeau sur le zinc des mastroquets.","Bibi-la-Grillade got up to fetch him a glass of anisette. She brought her chair closer, she sat down. While she was sipping her anisette, she suddenly remembered the plum she had eaten with Coupeau long ago, near the door, when he was courting her. At that time, she left the fruit sauce in brandy. And now she was back to liquor. Oh ! she knew herself, she didn't have two farthings of willpower. All we had to do was give him a flick on the back to send him tumbling into the drink. Even that seemed very good to him, the anisette, perhaps a little too sweet, a little sickening. And she sipped her glass, listening to Bec-Salé, known as Boit-sans-Soif, recount her affair with fat Eulalie, the one who sold fish in the street, a rudely cunning woman, a private individual who sniffed him out at the merchants of vin, while pushing his car, along the sidewalks; the comrades warned and hid him in vain, she often pinched him, she had even, the day before, thrown a dab at him in the face, to teach him to miss the workshop. For example, that was funny. Bibi-la-Grillade and Mes-Bottes, their ribs bursting with laughter, slapped the shoulders of Gervaise, who was finally laughing, as if tickled and in spite of herself; and they advised her to imitate fat Eulalie, to bring her irons and iron Coupeau's ears on the zinc of the mastroquets.","Bibi brought her a glass of anisette. As she sipped it she remembered all at once the brandied fruit she had eaten in the same place with Coupeau when he was courting her. That day she had left the brandy and took only the fruit, and now she was sitting there drinking liqueur.","Bibi-the-Smoker rose from his seat to fetch her a glass of anisette. She drew her chair up to the table. Whilst she was sipping her anisette, a recollection suddenly flashed across her mind, she remembered the plum she had taken with Coupeau, near the door, in the old days, when he was courting her. At that time, she used to leave the juice of fruits preserved in brandy. And now, here was she going back to liqueurs. Oh! she knew herself well , she had not two thimblefuls of will. One would only have had to have given her a walloping across the back to have made her regularly wallow in drink. The anisette even seemed to be very good, perhaps rather too sweet and slightly sickening. She went on sipping as she listened to Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst, tell of his affair with fat Eulalie, a fish peddler and very shrewd at locating him. Even if his comrades tried to hide him, she could usually sniff him out when he was late. Just the night before she had slapped his face with a flounder to teach him not to neglect going to work. Bibi-the-Smoker and My-Boots nearly split their sides laughing. They slapped Gervaise on the shoulder and she began to laugh also, finding it amusing in spite of herself."
Le forgeron voulait parler d'une commande de gros boulons qui nécessitaient deux frappeurs à l'enclume.,The blacksmith wanted to talk about an order for large bolts that required two strikers at the anvil.,"he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with joy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne toward his mother.","The blacksmith was alluding to an order for big bolts which necessitated two beaters at the anvil. “I’m ready to start at this moment, big baby!”"

"Cependant, Gervaise lavait son linge de couleur dans l'eau chaude, grasse de savon, qu'elle avait conservée. Quand elle eut fini, elle approcha un tréteau, jeta en travers toutes les pièces, qui faisaient à terre des mares bleuâtres. Et elle commença à rincer. Derrière elle, le robinet d'eau froide coulait au-dessus d'un vaste baquet, fixé au sol, et que traversaient deux barres de bois, pour soutenir le linge. Au-dessus, en l'air, deux autres barres passaient, où le linge achevait de s'égoutter.","However, Gervaise washed her colored linen in hot water, greasy with soap, which she had saved. When she had finished, she approached a trestle, threw all the pieces across it, which formed bluish pools on the ground. And she began to rinse. Behind her, the cold water tap flowed above a large tub, fixed to the floor, and crossed by two wooden bars to support the laundry. Above, in the air, passed two other bars, where the laundry was finishing dripping.","All this time Gervaise was going on with her task and had just completed the washing of her colored pieces, which she threw over a trestle to drip; soon small pools of blue water stood on the floor. Then she began to rinse the garments in cold water which ran from a spigot near by.","Gervaise was washing her colored things in the hot water thick with lather, which she had kept for the purpose. When she had finished, she drew a trestle towards her and hung across it all the different articles; the drippings from which made bluish puddles on the floor; and she commenced rinsing. Behind her, the cold water tap was set running into a vast tub fixed to the ground, and across which were two wooden bars whereon to lay the clothes. High up in the air were two other bars for the things to finish dripping on."
"Coupeau terminait alors la toiture d'une maison neuve, à trois étages.",Coupeau was then finishing the roof of a new three-storey house.,Coupeau was then completing the roof of a three-storied house and was laying the very last sheets of zinc.,Coupeau was then finishing the roofing of a new three-storied house.
"L'alambic, avec ses récipients de forme étrange, ses enroulements sans fin de tuyaux, gardait une mine sombre ; pas une fumée ne s'échappait ; à peine entendait-on un souffle intérieur, un ronflement souterrain ; c'était comme une besogne de nuit faite en plein jour, par un travailleur morne, puissant et muet. Cependant, Mes-Bottes, accompagné de ses deux camarades, était venu s'accouder sur la barrière, en attendant qu'un coin du comptoir fût libre. Il avait un rire de poulie mal graissée, hochant la tête, les yeux attendris, fixés sur la machine à soûler. Tonnerre de Dieu ! elle était bien gentille ! Il y avait, dans ce gros bedon de cuivre, de quoi se tenir le gosier au frais pendant huit jours. Lui, aurait voulu qu'on lui soudât le bout du serpentin entre les dents, pour sentir le vitriol encore chaud, l'emplir, lui descendre jusqu'aux talons, toujours, toujours, comme un petit ruisseau. Dame ! il ne se serait plus dérangé, ça aurait joliment remplacé les dés à coudre de ce roussin de père Colombe ! Et les camarades ricanaient, disaient que cet animal de Mes-Bottes avait un fichu grelot, tout de même. L'alambic, sourdement, sans une flamme, sans une gaieté dans les reflets éteints de ses cuivres, continuait, laissait couler sa sueur d'alcool, pareil à une source lente et entêtée, qui à la longue devait envahir la salle, se répandre sur les boulevards extérieurs, inonder le trou immense de Paris. Alors, Gervaise, prise d'un frisson, recula ; et elle tâchait de sourire, en murmurant :","The still, with its oddly shaped containers, its endless windings of pipes, looked grim; not a smoke escaped; you could hardly hear an interior murmur, a subterranean snoring; it was like a night job done in broad daylight, by a dull, powerful, silent worker. Meanwhile, My-Boots, accompanied by his two comrades, had come to lean on the barrier, while waiting for a corner of the counter to be free. He laughed like a badly greased pulley, shaking his head, his tender eyes fixed on the drunken machine. Thunder of God! she was very nice! There was, in this big copper paunch, enough to keep the throat cool for a week. He would have liked the end of the serpentine to be welded between his teeth, to feel the vitriol still warm, to fill it, to descend to his heels, always, always, like a little stream. Lady ! he wouldn't have bothered himself any more, it would have nicely replaced the thimbles of that roussin daddy Colombe! And the comrades laughed, said that this animal from My-Boots had a damn bell, all the same. The still, silently, without a flame, without a gaiety in the extinguished reflections of its brass, continued, letting its alcoholic sweat flow, like a slow and stubborn source, which in the long run was to invade the room, to spread on the outer boulevards, flooding the immense hole in Paris. Then Gervaise, seized with a shudder, recoiled; and she tried to smile, murmuring:","The still, with its intricate and endless coils of wire and pipes, had a dreary aspect. Not a breath escaped from it, and hardly a sound was heard. It was like some night task performed in daylight by a melancholy, silent workman. In the meantime Mes-Bottes, accompanied by his two comrades, had lounged to the oak railing and leaned there until there was a corner of the counter free. He laughed a tipsy laugh as he stood with his eyes fixed on the machine. ""By thunder!"" he muttered. ""That is a jolly little thing!"" He went on to say that it held enough to keep their throats fresh for a week. As for himself, he would like to hold the end of that pipe between his teeth, and he would like to feel that liquor run down his throat in a steady stream until it reached his heels. The still did its work slowly but surely. There was not a glimmer on its surface—no firelight reflected in its clean-colored sides. The liquor dropped steadily and suggested a persevering stream which would gradually invade the room, spread over the streets and boulevard and finally deluge and inundate Paris itself. Gervaise shuddered and drew back. She tried to smile, but her lips quivered as she murmured:","Not a single gay puff of steam was coming forth from the endless coils. The breathing could barely be heard. It sounded muffled as if from underground. It was like a sombre worker, performing dark deeds in the bright daylight, strong but silent. My-Boots, accompanied by his two comrades, came to lean on the railing until they could get a place at the bar. He laughed, looking at the machine. Tonnerre de Dieu, that’s clever. There’s enough stuff in its big belly to last for weeks. He wouldn’t mind if they just fixed the end of the tube in his mouth, so he could feel the fiery spirits flowing down to his heels like a river. It would be better than the tiny sips doled out by Pere Colombe! His two comrades laughed with him, saying that My-Boots was quite a guy after all. The huge still continued to trickle forth its alcoholic sweat. Eventually it would invade the bar, flow out along the outer Boulevards, and inundate the immense expanse of Paris. Gervaise stepped back, shivering. She tried to smile as she said:"
- Qu'est-ce qu'elle a dit ? qu'est-ce qu'elle a dit ? demandait tout l'atelier brûlant de curiosité.,"- What did she say ? what did she say ? asked the whole studio, burning with curiosity.",""" But Augustine sharply answered that she did not like the old man.","“What did she say? What did she say?” asked the whole workroom, aglow with curiosity."
"- Personne ne dit le bénédicité ? demanda Boche, pendant que les dames arrangeaient leurs jupes sous la nappe, par peur des taches.","- No one says grace? Boche asked, while the ladies were arranging their skirts under the tablecloth, for fear of stains.","""No one has asked a blessing,"" said Boche as the ladies pulled the tablecloth well over their skirts to protect them from spots.","“Does nobody say grace?” asked Boche, whilst the ladies arranged their skirts under the table-cloth, so as not to get them stained."
"Gervaise, stupide, la gorge déchirée d'un grand cri, resta les bras en l'air. Des passants accoururent, un attroupement se forma. Madame Boche, bouleversée, fléchissant sur ses jambes, prit Nana entre ses bras, pour lui cacher la tête et l'empêcher de voir. Cependant, en face, la petite vieille, comme satisfaite, fermait tranquillement sa fenêtre.","Gervaise, stupid, her throat torn with a loud cry, remained with her arms in the air. Passers-by ran up, a crowd formed. Madame Boche, overwhelmed, bending over on her legs, took Nana in her arms to hide her head and prevent her from seeing. However, opposite, the little old woman, as if satisfied, quietly closed her window.","Gervaise stood still. A shriek was frozen on her lips. Mme Boche snatched Nana in her arms and hid her head that she might not see, and the little old woman opposite, who seemed to have waited for this scene in the drama, quietly closed her windows.","Gervaise, stupefied, her throat rent by one great cry, stood holding up her arms. Some passers-by hastened to the spot; a crowd soon formed. Madame Boche, utterly upset, her knees bending under her, took Nana in her arms, to hide her head and prevent her seeing. Meanwhile, the little old woman opposite quietly closed her window, as though satisfied."
"Et comme la grande Clémence s'égayait de ce qu'il avait vu la rue soûle, il fut pris lui-même d'une joie énorme dont il faillit étrangler. Il criait :","And as the tall Clemence was amused by what he had seen the street drunk, he himself was seized with an enormous joy which he almost strangled. He was shouting :","""By Jove!"" he said.","And as tall Clemence laughed at his thinking that the people in the street were drunk, he was himself seized with an intense fit of gaiety which almost strangled him."
"Et il s'en alla à grandes enjambées, laissant Gervaise étourdie, écoutant sa dernière parole battre dans ses oreilles avec un bourdonnement de cloche. En entrant chez le marchand de vin, elle entendait sourdement au fond d'elle : « Tout est fini, eh bien ! tout est fini ; je n'ai plus rien à faire, moi, si tout est fini ! » Elle s'assit, elle avala une bouchée de pain et de fromage, vida un verre plein qu'elle trouva devant elle.","And he went away with great strides, leaving Gervaise stunned, listening to his last word beating in his ears with a ringing bell. As she entered the wine merchant's, she heard dully inside her: “It's all over, well! all is finished ; I have nothing more to do, if all is over! She sat down, she swallowed a mouthful of bread and cheese, emptied a full glass which she found in front of her.","And he walked off with long strides, leaving Gervaise stunned by his words. ""All is over between us!"" she kept saying to herself. "" And what more is there for me then in life?"" She sat down in her empty, desolate room and drank a large tumbler of wine.","And he went off with long strides, leaving Gervaise bewildered, listening to his last words which rang in her ears with the clang of a big bell. On entering the wine shop, she seemed to hear a hollow voice within her which said, “All is over, well! All is over; there is nothing more for me to do if all is over!” Sitting down, she swallowed a mouthful of bread and cheese, and emptied a glass full of wine which she found before her."
"Elle se tassait, elle attendait toujours. Sa fille n'avait donc pas eu une parole pour elle ? Dans le silence, on entendait de nouveau la scie de Poisson. Lantier, égayé, suçait rapidement son sucre d'orge, avec un sifflement des lèvres.","She settled down, she was still waiting. Her daughter hadn't had a word for her? In the silence, the saw of Poisson could be heard again. Lantier, amused, quickly sucked on his barley sugar, whistling his lips.",She stood waiting. Surely this was not all. Her daughter must have sent her some especial message. Lantier ate his sugarplums.,"She drew herself together, and still waited. Hadn’t her daughter had a word for her then? In the silence Poisson’s saw could be heard again. Lantier, who felt gay, was sucking his barley-sugar, and smacking his lips."
"- Salope ! salope ! salope ! hurla Gervaise, hors d'elle, reprise par un tremblement furieux.","- Bitch! bitch! bitch! yelled Gervaise, beside herself, again taken up by a furious trembling.","""Miserable fool!"" cried Gervaise, white with anger.","“You dirty jade! You dirty jade! You dirty jade!” yelled Gervaise, beside herself, and again seized with a furious trembling."
"Naturellement, lorsqu'on se décatit à ce point, tout l'orgueil de la femme s'en va. Gervaise avait mis sous elle ses anciennes fiertés, ses coquetteries, ses besoins de sentiments, de convenances et d'égards. On pouvait lui allonger des coups de soulier partout, devant et derrière, elle ne les sentait pas, elle devenait trop flasque et trop molle. Ainsi, Lantier l'avait complètement lâchée ; il ne la pinçait même plus pour la forme ; et elle semblait ne s'être pas aperçue de cette fin d'une longue liaison, lentement traînée et dénouée dans une lassitude mutuelle. C'était, pour elle, une corvée de moins. Même les rapports de Lantier et de Virginie la laissaient parfaitement calme, tant elle avait une grosse indifférence pour toutes ces bêtises dont elle rageait si fort autrefois. Elle leur aurait tenu la chandelle, s'ils avaient voulu. Personne maintenant n'ignorait la chose, le chapelier et l'épicière menaient un beau train. Ça leur était trop commode aussi, ce cornard de Poisson avait tous les deux jours un service de nuit, qui le faisait grelotter sur les trottoirs déserts, pendant que sa femme et le voisin, à la maison, se tenaient les pieds chauds. Oh ! ils ne se pressaient pas, ils entendaient sonner lentement ses bottes, le long de la boutique, dans la rue noire et vide, sans pour cela hasarder leurs nez hors de la couverture. Un sergent de ville ne connaît que son devoir, n'est-ce pas ? et ils restaient tranquillement jusqu'au jour à lui endommager sa propriété, pendant que cet homme sévère veillait sur la propriété des autres. Tout le quartier de la Goutte-d'Or rigolait de cette bonne farce. On trouvait drôle le cocuage de l'autorité. D'ailleurs, Lantier avait conquis ce coin-là. La boutique et la boutiquière allaient ensemble. Il venait de manger une blanchisseuse ; à présent, il croquait une épicière ; et s'il s'établissait à la file des mercières, des papetières, des modistes, il était de mâchoires assez larges pour les avaler.","Naturally, when one becomes so decrepit, all the pride of woman goes away. Gervaise had placed under her her old pride, her coquetry, her need for feelings, propriety and consideration. You could hit her with the shoe everywhere, in front and behind, she didn't feel them, she became too flabby and too soft. Thus, Lantier had completely let go of her; he no longer even pinched her for form; and she seemed not to have noticed this end of a long liaison, slowly dragged on and undone in a mutual weariness. It was one less chore for her. Even Lantier's and Virginie's reports left her perfectly calm, so indifferent was she to all the nonsense she used to rage so hard about. She would have held the candle for them, if they had wanted. Nobody now was unaware of the thing, the hatter and the grocer were leading a fine train. It was too convenient for them too, that scumbag Fish had a night shift every two days, which made him shiver on the deserted sidewalks, while his wife and the neighbor at home kept their feet warm. Oh ! they were in no hurry, they heard his boots ringing slowly along the side of the shop, in the dark and empty street, without on that account risking their noses out of the blanket. A policeman only knows his duty, doesn't he? and they sat quietly till daybreak damaging his property, while this stern man watched over the property of others. The whole neighborhood of Goutte-d'Or laughed at this good farce. We found the cuckoldry of authority funny. Besides, Lantier had conquered that corner. The shop and the shopkeeper went together. He had just eaten a laundress; now he was eating a grocer; and if he stood in the line of haberdashers, papermakers, milliners, his jaws were wide enough to swallow them.","Her womanly pride and vanity had all departed. Lantier never seemed to see her when they met by chance, and she hardly noticed that the liaison which had stretched along for so many years had ended in a mutual disenchantment. Lantier had done wisely, so far as he was concerned, in counseling Virginie to open the kind of shop she had.","Naturally enough when a woman falls to this point all her pride leaves her. Gervaise had divested herself of all her old self-respect, coquetry and need of sentiment, propriety and politeness. You might have kicked her, no matter where, she did not feel kicks for she had become too fat and flabby. Lantier had altogether neglected her; he no longer escorted her or even bothered to give her a pinch now and again. She did not seem to notice this finish of a long liaison slowly spun out, and ending in mutual insolence. It was a chore the less for her. Even Lantier’s intimacy with Virginie left her quite calm, so great was her indifference now for all that she had been so upset about in the past. She would even have held a candle for them now. Everyone was aware that Virginie and Lantier were carrying on. It was much too convenient, especially with Poisson on duty every other night. Lantier had thought of himself when he advised Virginie to deal in dainties. He was too much of a Provincial not to adore sugared things; and in fact he would have lived off sugar candy, lozenges, pastilles, sugar plums and chocolate."
"- La tête du boulon était polie, nette, sans une bavure, un vrai travail de bijouterie, une rondeur de bille faite au moule. Les ouvriers la regardèrent en hochant le menton ; il n'y avait pas à dire, c'était à se mettre à genoux devant. Bec-Salé, dit Boit-sans-Soif, essaya bien de blaguer ; mais il barbota, il finit par retourner à son enclume, le nez pincé. Cependant, Gervaise s'était serrée contre Goujet, comme pour mieux voir. Etienne avait lâché le soufflet, la forge de nouveau s'emplissait d'ombre, d'un coucher d'astre rouge, qui tombait tout d'un coup à une grande nuit. Et le forgeron et la blanchisseuse éprouvaient une douceur en sentant cette nuit les envelopper, dans ce hangar noir de suie et de limaille, où des odeurs de vieux fers montaient ; ils ne se seraient pas crus plus seuls dans le bois de Vincennes, s'ils s'étaient donné un rendez-vous au fond d'un trou d'herbe. Il lui prit la main comme s'il l'avait conquise.","- Bolt head was polished, clean, without a burr, real jewelry work, molded ball roundness. The workers looked at her, shaking their chins; there was no denying it, it was worth kneeling in front of. Bec-Salé, known as Boit-sans-Soif, tried hard to joke; but he paddled, he ended up returning to his anvil, his nose pinched. However, Gervaise had squeezed closer to Goujet, as if to see better. Etienne had let go of the bellows, the forge was once again filled with shadow, with the setting of a red star, which suddenly fell into deep night. And the blacksmith and the laundress felt a sweetness in feeling the night envelop them, in this shed black with soot and filings, where the odors of old iron rose; they would not have thought themselves more alone in the Bois de Vincennes if they had agreed to meet at the bottom of a hole in the grass. He took her hand as if he had conquered it.","In this way she had paid half the money she had borrowed, when one quarter day, not knowing to whom to turn, as she had not been able to collect her bills punctually, she ran to the Goujets' and borrowed the amount of her rent from them.","The head of the bolt was clean, polished, and without a flaw, regular goldsmith’s work, with the roundness of a marble cast in a mold. The other men looked at it and nodded their heads; there was no denying it was lovely enough to be worshipped. Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst, tried indeed to chuff; but it was no use, and ended by returning to his anvil, with his nose put out of joint. Gervaise had squeezed up against Goujet, as though to get a better view. Etienne having let go the bellows, the forge was once more becoming enveloped in shadow, like a brilliant red sunset suddenly giving way to black night. And the blacksmith and the laundress experienced a sweet pleasure in feeling this gloom surround them in that shed black with soot and filings, and where an odor of old iron prevailed. They could not have thought themselves more alone in the Bois de Vincennes had they met there in the depths of some copse. He took her hand as though he had conquered her."
"Gervaise monta rapidement. Elle avait de l'amitié pour madame Bijard, sa laveuse, qui était une femme d'un grand courage. Elle espérait mettre le holà. En haut, au sixième, la porte de la chambre était restée ouverte, quelques locataires s'exclamaient sur le carré, tandis que madame Boche, devant la porte, criait :","Gervaise climbed quickly. She was friendly with Madame Bijard, her washerwoman, who was a woman of great courage. She hoped to put the kibosh. Upstairs, on the sixth floor, the bedroom door had remained open, a few tenants were exclaiming on the square, while Madame Boche, in front of the door, was shouting:","Gervaise flew up the stairs. She was very fond of Mme Bijard, who was her laundress and whose courage and industry she greatly admired. On the sixth floor a little crowd was assembled. Mme Boche stood at an open door.","Gervaise hastened to the spot. She felt some friendship for her washer-woman, Madame Bijard, who was a very courageous woman. She had hoped to put a stop to what was going on. Upstairs, on the sixth floor the door of the room was wide open, some lodgers were shouting on the landing, whilst Madame Boche, standing in front of the door, was calling out:"

"Il l'avait empoignée, il ne la lâchait pas. Elle s'abandonnait, étourdie par le léger vertige qui lui venait du tas de linge, sans dégoût pour l'haleine vineuse de Coupeau. Et le gros baiser qu'ils échangèrent à pleine bouche, au milieu des saletés du métier, était comme une première chute, dans le lent avachissement de leur vie.","He had grabbed her, he wouldn't let go. She abandoned herself, stunned by the slight dizziness that came to her from the heap of linen, without disgust for Coupeau's vinous breath. And the big kiss they exchanged openly, in the middle of the filth of the trade, was like a first fall, in the slow sagging of their lives.","she said but yielded to his embrace, and the long kiss they exchanged before these people, amid the sickening odor of the soiled linen and the alcoholic fumes of his breath, was the first downward step in the slow descent of their degradation.","He had caught hold of her and would not let her go. She gradually abandoned herself to him, dizzy from the slight faintness caused by the heap of clothes and not minding Coupeau’s foul-smelling breath. The long kiss they exchanged on each other’s mouths in the midst of the filth of the laundress’s trade was perhaps the first tumble in the slow downfall of their life together."
"Et elle tourna le dos, elle se remit à tirer son fil d'or, en affectant d'ignorer la présence de sa belle-sœur. Mais Lorilleux avait levé sa face blême, criant :","And she turned her back, she resumed pulling her golden thread, affecting to ignore the presence of her sister-in-law.

Monsieur Coupeau, prettier than me, and who won't have two brats around.","""You are keeping me here to talk,"" she said, ""and they are waiting for me at my employer's. You will find some other woman, Monsieur Coupeau, far prettier than I, who will not have two children to bring up!""","“You’re making me talk; they must be expecting me at the shop. You’ll easily find someone else prettier than I, Monsieur Coupeau, and who won’t have two boys to drag about with her.”"
"A cette heure du déjeuner, l'Assommoir restait vide. Un gros homme de quarante ans, le père Colombe, en gilet à manches, servait une petite fille d'une dizaine d'années, qui lui demandait quatre sous de goutte dans une tasse. Une nappe de soleil entrait par la porte, chauffait le parquet toujours humide des crachats des fumeurs. Et, du comptoir, des tonneaux, de toute la salle, montait une odeur liquoreuse, une fumée d'alcool qui semblait épaissir et griser les poussières volantes du soleil.","At this lunch hour, L'Assommoir remained empty. A fat man of forty, Father Colombe, in a sleeveless waistcoat, was serving a little girl of about ten, who asked him for four sous a drop in a cup. A sheet of sunlight entered through the door, warming the floor, which was still damp with the spitting of smokers. And from the counter, from the barrels, from the whole room, rose a syrupy smell, a smoke of alcohol which seemed to thicken and intoxicate the flying dust of the sun.","At this early hour the Assommoir was nearly empty. A stout man in his shirt sleeves— Father Colombe himself—was serving a little girl not more than twelve years old with four cents' worth of liquor in a cup. The sun streamed in at the door and lay on the floor, which was black where the men had spat as they smoked. And from the counter, from the casks, from all the room, rose an alcoholic emanation which seemed to intoxicate the very particles of dust floating in the sunshine.","L’Assommoir was nearly empty at the lunch hour. Pere Colombe, a heavy man of forty, was serving a ten year old girl who had asked him to place four sous’ worth of brandy into her cup. A shaft of sunlight came through the entrance to warm the floor which was always damp from the smokers’ spitting. From everything, the casks, the bar, the entire room, a liquorish odor arose, an alcoholic aroma which seemed to thicken and befuddle the dust motes dancing in the sunlight."
"- Chut ! soyons sages, dit-il, il ne faut pas réveiller les gosses ? A demain.","- Hush! let's be wise, he said, we mustn't wake the kids? See you tomorrow.","""Hush!"" he said. ""We must not wake the boys. Good night.""","Then, as this caress caused a noise, he became anxious, and went softly and looked at Claude and Etienne. “Hush, we must be careful,” said he in a whisper, “and not wake the children. Good-bye till to-morrow.”"
"- Hein ! les sacrés pochards ! Ils sont d'un farce ! ? Mais ce n'est pas leur faute, c'est le soleil ?","- Eh ! the sacred pochards! They are a joke! ? But it's not their fault, it's the sun?","""By Jove!"" he said. ""The sun beats down on one's head like a hammer.""",“Look at them! The blessed tipplers! Aren’t they funny?” he cried. “But it’s not their fault. It’s the sun that’s causing it.”
"- Nous ne sommes pas riches, bien sûr ; mais nous voulons encore nous conduire proprement ? Si maman Coupeau ne nous a rien laissé, ce n'est pas une raison pour la jeter dans la terre comme un chien ? Non, il faut une messe, avec un corbillard assez gentil ?","- We are not rich, of course; but we still want to behave properly? If Mama Coupeau left us nothing, isn't that a reason to throw her into the ground like a dog? No, do you need a mass, with a nice enough hearse?","""We are not rich, to be sure, but we wish to do what she would have liked. If Mamma Coupeau has left us nothing it was not her fault and no reason why we should bury her as if she were a dog. No, there must be a Mass and a hearse.""","“We’re not rich certainly; but all the same we wish to act decently. If mother Coupeau has left us nothing, it’s no reason for pitching her into the ground like a dog. No; we must have a mass, and a hearse with a few ornaments.”"
"- Ne m'en parlez pas ! répondit Gervaise, il était très bien pour moi, là-bas ; mais, depuis que nous sommes à Paris, je ne peux plus en venir à bout ? Il faut vous dire que sa mère est morte l'année dernière, en lui laissant quelque chose, dix-sept cents francs à peu près. Il voulait partir pour Paris. Alors, comme le père Macquart m'envoyait toujours des gifles sans crier gare, j'ai consenti à m'en aller avec lui ; nous avons fait le voyage avec les deux enfants. Il devait m'établir blanchisseuse et travailler de son état de chapelier. Nous aurions été très heureux ? Mais, voyez-vous, Lantier est un ambitieux, un dépensier, un homme qui ne songe qu'à son amusement. Il ne vaut pas grand-chose, enfin ? Nous sommes donc descendus à l'hôtel Montmartre, rue Montmartre. Et ç'a été des dîners, des voitures, le théâtre, une montre pour lui, une robe de soie pour moi ; car il n'a pas mauvais cœur, quand il a de l'argent. Vous comprenez, tout le tremblement, si bien qu'au bout de deux mois nous étions nettoyés. C'est à ce moment-là que nous sommes venus habiter l'hôtel Boncœur et que la sacrée vie a commencé ?","- Don't tell me! answered Gervaise, he was very good for me over there; but, since we've been in Paris, I can't manage it anymore? I must tell you that his mother died last year, leaving him something, seventeen hundred francs or so. He wanted to go to Paris. So, as Father Macquart always slapped me without warning, I agreed to go away with him; we made the trip with the two children. He was to set me up as a laundress and work as a hatter. We would have been very happy? But, you see, Lantier is ambitious, a spendthrift, a man who thinks only of his amusement. It's not worth much, after all? So we got off at the Hotel Montmartre, rue Montmartre. And it was dinners, cars, the theater, a watch for him, a silk dress for me; for he does not have a bad heart when he has money. You understand, all the shaking, so after two months we were cleansed. Is that when we came to live at the Hôtel Boncœur and the sacred life began?","""He is not good to you then?"" ""He was very good to me once,"" answered Gervaise, ""but since we came to Paris he has changed. His mother died last year and left him about seventeen hundred francs. He wished to come to Paris, and as Father Macquart was in the habit of hitting me in the face without any warning, I said I would come, too, which we did, with the two children. I meant to be a fine laundress, and he was to continue with his trade as a hatter. We might have been very happy. But, you see, Lantier is extravagant; he likes expensive things and thinks of his amusement before anything else. He is not good for much, anyhow! ""We arrived at the Hôtel Montmartre. We had dinners and carriages, suppers and theaters, a watch for him, a silk dress for me—for he is not selfish when he has money. You can easily imagine, therefore, at the end of two months we were cleaned out. Then it was that we came to Hôtel Boncoeur and that this life began.""","“Don’t mention it!” replied Gervaise. “He used to behave very well in the country; but, since we’ve been in Paris, he’s been unbearable. I must tell you that his mother died last year and left him some money—about seventeen hundred francs. He would come to Paris, so, as old Macquart was forever knocking me about without warning, I consented to come away with him. We made the journey with two children. He was to set me up as a laundress, and work himself at his trade of a hatter. We should have been very happy; but, you see, Lantier’s ambitious and a spendthrift, a fellow who only thinks of amusing himself. In short, he’s not worth much. On arriving, we went to the Hotel Montmartre, in the Rue Montmartre. And then there were dinners, and cabs, and the theatre; a watch for himself and a silk dress for me, for he’s not unkind when he’s got the money. You understand, he went in for everything, and so well that at the end of two months we were cleaned out. It was then that we came to live at the Hotel Boncoeur, and that this horrible life began.”"
"Goujet, voyant Gervaise embarrassée d'Etienne, et voulant le sauver des coups de pied au derrière de Coupeau, l'avait embauché pour tirer le soufflet, à sa fabrique de boulons. L'état de cloutier, s'il n'avait rien de flatteur en lui-même, à cause de la saleté de la forge et de l'embêtement de toujours taper sur les mêmes morceaux de fer, était un riche état, où l'on gagnait des dix et des douze francs par jour. Le petit, alors âgé de douze ans, pourrait s'y mettre bientôt, si le métier lui allait. Et Etienne était ainsi devenu un lien de plus entre la blanchisseuse et le forgeron. Celui-ci ramenait l'enfant, donnait des nouvelles de sa bonne conduite. Tout le monde disait en riant à Gervaise que Goujet avait un béguin pour elle. Elle le savait bien, elle rougissait comme une jeune fille, avec une fleur de pudeur qui lui mettait aux joues des tons vifs de pomme d'api. Ah ! le pauvre cher garçon, il n'était pas gênant ! Jamais il ne lui avait parlé de ça ; jamais un geste sale, jamais un mot polisson. On n'en rencontrait pas beaucoup de cette honnête pâte Et, sans vouloir l'avouer, elle goûtait une grande joie à être aimée ainsi, pareillement à une sainte vierge. Quand il lui arrivait quelque ennui sérieux, elle songeait au forgeron ; ça la consolait. Ensemble, s'ils restaient seuls, ils n'étaient pas gênés du tout ; ils se regardaient avec des sourires, bien en face, sans se raconter ce qu'ils éprouvaient. C'était une tendresse raisonnable, ne songeant pas aux vilaines choses, parce qu'il faut encore mieux garder sa tranquillité, quand on peut s'arranger pour être heureux, tout en restant tranquille.","Goujet, seeing Gervaise embarrassed by Etienne, and wanting to save him from Coupeau's kicks in the behind, had hired him to pull the bellows at his bolt factory. The state of nailmaker, if it had nothing flattering in itself, because of the dirtiness of the forge and the annoyance of always hitting on the same pieces of iron, was a rich state, where the We earned ten and twelve francs a day. The little one, then twelve years old, could get started soon, if the job suited him. And Etienne had thus become one more link between the laundress and the blacksmith. The latter brought the child back, gave news of his good behavior. Everyone said laughingly to Gervaise that Goujet had a crush on her. She knew it well, she blushed like a young girl, with a flower of modesty which gave her cheeks the bright tones of api apple. Ah! the poor dear boy, he was not embarrassing! He had never spoken to her about that; never a dirty gesture, never a naughty word. We didn't meet many of this honest paste And, without wanting to admit it, she tasted a great joy in being loved like this, like a holy virgin. Whenever serious trouble happened to her, she thought of the blacksmith; it comforted her. Together, if they were left alone, they weren't embarrassed at all; they looked at each other with smiles, straight in the face, without telling each other what they were feeling. It was a reasonable tenderness, not thinking about bad things, because it is even better to keep calm, when you can manage to be happy, while remaining calm.","Goujet, wishing to save Etienne from Coupeau's rough treatment, had taken him to the place where he was employed to blow the bellows, with the prospect of becoming an apprentice as soon as he was old enough, and Etienne thus became another tie between the clearstarcher and the blacksmith. All their little world laughed and told Gervaise that her friend worshiped the very ground she trod upon. She colored and looked like a girl of sixteen. ""Dear boy,"" she said to herself, ""I know he loves me, but never has he said or will he say a word of the kind to me!"" And she was proud of being loved in this way. When she was disturbed about anything her first thought was to go to him. When by chance they were left alone together they were never disturbed by wondering if their friendship verged on love. There was no harm in such affection.","Goujet, seeing that Gervaise did not know what to do with Etienne, and wishing to deliver him from Coupeau’s kicks, had engaged him to go and blow the bellows at the factory where he worked. The profession of bolt-maker, if not one to be proud of on account of the dirt of the forge and of the monotony of constantly hammering on pieces of iron of a similar kind, was nevertheless a well paid one, at which ten and even twelve francs a day could be earned. The youngster, who was then twelve years old, would soon be able to go in for it, if the calling was to his liking. And Etienne had thus become another link between the laundress and the blacksmith. The latter would bring the child home and speak of his good conduct. Everyone laughingly said that Goujet was smitten with Gervaise. She knew it, and blushed like a young girl, the flush of modesty coloring her cheeks with the bright tints of an apple. The poor fellow, he was never any trouble! He never made a bold gesture or an indelicate remark. You didn’t find many men like him. Gervaise didn’t want to admit it, but she derived a great deal of pleasure from being adored like this. Whenever a problem arose she thought immediately of the blacksmith and was consoled. There was never any awkward tension when they were alone together. They just looked at each other and smiled happily with no need to talk. It was a very sensible kind of affection."
"Et il passait la main devant son visage, il soufflait pour écarter des poils. L'interne l'interrogea :","And he passed his hand in front of his face, he blew to brush away the hairs. The intern asked him:",And he passed his hand over his face as if to take away the hair.,"And he passed his hand before his face, he blew to send the hairs away. The house surgeon questioned him."
"Il ne dit pas non. La paix semblait se faire. La jeune femme achevait de mettre en paquet le linge sale. Mais quand elle voulut prendre les chemises et les chaussettes de Lantier au fond de la malle, il lui cria de laisser ça.","He doesn't say no. Peace seemed to be made. The young woman was finishing packing the dirty laundry. But when she wanted to take Lantier's shirts and socks from the bottom of the trunk, he shouted at her to leave it.","He made no reply. Peace seemed to be made, but when Gervaise went to the trunk to take out some of Lantier's clothing he called out:","He did not say no. Their quarrel seemed to be forgotten. The young woman was completing her bundle of dirty clothes. But when she went to take Lantier’s shirts and socks from the bottom of the trunk, he called to her to leave them alone."
"- Soyez raisonnable, taisez-vous, on vous regarde, répétait madame Boche qui s'empressait autour d'elle. Est-il possible de se faire tant de mal pour un homme ! ? Vous l'aimiez donc toujours, hein ? ma pauvre chérie. Tout à l'heure, vous étiez joliment montée contre lui. Et vous voilà, maintenant, à le pleurer, à vous crever le cœur ? Mon Dieu, que nous sommes bêtes !","""Be reasonable, shut up, we're watching you,"" repeated Madame Boche, hurrying around her. Is it possible to hurt yourself so much for a man! ? So you still loved him, huh? my poor darling. Earlier, you were nicely up against him. And here you are, now, crying, breaking your heart? My God, how stupid we are!","""Be reasonable, child! Be quiet,"" whispered Mme Boche. ""They are all looking at you. Is it possible you can care so much for any man? You love him still, although such a little while ago you pretended you did not care for him, and you cry as if your heart would break! Oh lord, what fools we women are!""","“Be reasonable, do be quiet, everyone’s looking at you,” Madame Boche, who hovered round her, kept repeating. “How can you worry yourself so much on account of a man? You loved him, then, all the same, did you, my poor darling? A little while ago you were saying all sorts of things against him; and now you’re crying for him, and almost breaking your heart. Dear me, how silly we all are!”"
"- Vous arrivez bien ! cria Gervaise. Maman Coupeau, montrez-lui donc la bête.","- You have arrived well! cried Gervaise. Mother Coupeau, show him the beast.","""You are just in season. Mamma Coupeau, show her the goose,"" cried Gervaise.","“You’ve come just at the right time!” exclaimed Gervaise. “Mother Coupeau, do show her the bird.”"
"- Bon ! me voilà prévenu. Je ne mangerai pas chez eux un boisseau de sel ? J'en vais tâter ce matin ; mais si le patron m'embête, je te le ramasse et je te l'assois sur sa bourgeoise, tu sais, collés comme une paire de soles !","- Good ! I have been warned. I won't eat a bushel of salt at their place? I'm going to try it this morning; but if the boss bothers me, I'll pick it up for you and sit it on your bourgeoise, you know, glued like a pair of soles!","If you drink a drop he says you are tipsy and makes no end of a row!"" ""Thanks for the warning. I will try this one day, and if the master bothers me I will just tell him what I think of him and turn on my heel and walk out.""","“Good; now I’m warned. I shan’t stop there for ever. I’ll just go this morning to see what it’s like; but if the boss bothers me, I’ll catch him up and plant him upon his missus, you know, bang together like two fillets of sole!”"
"Alors, le croque-mort se montra goguenard et insolent.",Then the undertaker showed himself mocking and insolent.,"""He is horribly drunk,"" she murmured in a tone of mingled disgust and terror.","Then he became insolent, and jeered:"
"Et elle se leva. Coupeau, qui approuvait vivement ses souhaits, était déjà debout, s'inquiétant de l'heure. Mais ils ne sortirent pas tout de suite ; elle eut la curiosité d'aller regarder, au fond, derrière la barrière de chêne, le grand alambic de cuivre rouge, qui fonctionnait sous le vitrage clair de la petite cour ; et le zingueur, qui l'avait suivie, lui expliqua comment ça marchait, indiquant du doigt les différentes pièces de l'appareil, montrant l'énorme cornue d'où tombait un filet limpide d'alcool.","And she got up. Coupeau, who warmly approved of his wishes, was already up, worrying about the time. But they didn't come out right away; she had the curiosity to go and look, at the back, behind the oak gate, at the great red copper still, which was working under the clear glass of the little courtyard; and the zinc worker, who had followed her, explained to her how it worked, pointing to the different parts of the apparatus, pointing to the enormous retort from which fell a limpid trickle of alcohol.","She pushed back her chair and rose. Coupeau argued with her vehemently and then gave an uneasy glance at the clock. They did not, however, depart at once. She wished to look at the still and stood for some minutes gazing with curiosity at the great copper machine. The tinworker, who had followed her, explained to her how the thing worked, pointing out with his finger the various parts of the machine, and showed the enormous retort whence fell the clear stream of alcohol.","And she rose from her seat. Coupeau, who cordially approved her wishes, was already standing up, anxious about the time. But they did not leave yet. Gervaise was curious enough to go to the far end of the room for a look at the big still behind the oak railing. It was chugging away in the little glassed-in courtyard. Coupeau explained its workings to her, pointing at the different parts of the machinery, showing her the trickling of the small stream of limpid alcohol."
"Lorsqu'elle s'engagea dans le corridor, elle était comme folle. Sa pauvre tête tournait. Au fond, sa grosse douleur venait d'avoir dit un adieu éternel au forgeron. C'était fini entre eux, ils ne se reverraient jamais. Puis, là-dessus, toutes les autres idées de malheur arrivaient et achevaient de lui casser le crâne. En passant, elle allongea le nez chez les Bijard, elle aperçut Lalie morte, l'air content d'être allongée, en train de se dorloter pour toujours. Ah bien ! les enfants avaient plus de chance que les grandes personnes ! Et, comme la porte du père Bazouge laissait passer une raie de lumière, elle entra droit chez lui, prise d'une rage de s'en aller par le même voyage que la petite.","When she entered the corridor, she was like mad. His poor head was spinning. Basically, his great pain came from having said an eternal farewell to the blacksmith. It was over between them, they would never see each other again. Then, on top of that, all the other ideas of misfortune arrived and finished breaking his skull. As she passed, she looked up at the Bijards', she saw Lalie dead, looking happy to be lying there, pampering herself forever. Ah well ! children were luckier than adults! And, as Father Bazouge's door let in a ray of light, she went straight into his room, seized with a rage at going on the same journey as the little one.","Yes, she would go into the country, for she should soon have her little green corner in Père-Lachaise. Her poor brain was disturbed. She had bidden an eternal farewell to Goujet. They would never see each other again. All was over between them—love and friendship too. As she passed the Bijards' she looked in and saw Lalie lying dead, happy and at peace. It was well with the child. ""She is lucky,"" muttered Gervaise. At this moment she saw a gleam of light under the undertaker's door.","When she entered the passage she was like a mad-woman. Her poor head was whirling round. At heart her great grief was at having bid the blacksmith an eternal farewell. All was ended between them; they would never see each other more. Then, besides that, all her other thoughts of misfortune pressed upon her, and almost caused her head to split. As she passed she poked her nose in at the Bijards’ and beheld Lalie dead, with a look of contentment on her face at having at last been laid out and slumbering forever. Ah, well! children were luckier than grown-up people. And, as a glimmer of light passed under old Bazouge’s door, she walked boldly in, seized with a mania for going off on the same journey as the little one."
"Mais les parties de volants n'étaient qu'une frime pour s'échapper. Brusquement, la maison tombait à un grand silence. Elles venaient de se glisser dans la rue et de gagner les boulevards extérieurs. Alors, toutes les six, se tenant par les bras, occupant la largeur des chaussées, s'en allaient, vêtues de clair, avec leurs rubans noués autour de leurs cheveux nus. Les yeux vifs, coulant de minces regards par le coin pincé des paupières, elles voyaient tout, elles renversaient le cou pour rire, en montrant le gras du menton. Dans les gros éclats de gaieté, lorsqu'un bossu passait ou qu'une vieille femme attendait son chien au coin des bornes, leur ligne se brisait, les unes restaient en arrière, tandis que les autres les tiraient violemment ; et elles balançaient les hanches, se pelotonnaient, se dégingandaient, histoire d'attrouper le monde et de faire craquer leur corsage sous leurs formes naissantes. La rue était à elles ; elles y avaient grandi, en relevant leurs jupes le long des boutiques ; elles s'y retroussaient encore jusqu'aux cuisses, pour rattacher leurs jarretières. Au milieu de la foule lente et blême, entre les arbres grêles des boulevards, leur débandade courait ainsi, de la barrière Rochechouart à la barrière Saint-Denis, bousculant les gens, coupant les groupes en zigzag, se retournant et lâchant des mots dans les fusées de leurs rires. Et leurs robes envolées laissaient, derrière elles, l'insolence de leur jeunesse ; elles s'étalaient en plein air, sous la lumière crue, d'une grossièreté ordurière de voyous, désirables et tendres comme des vierges qui reviennent du bain, la nuque trempée.","But the shuttlecock parties were just a show to escape. Suddenly the house fell into a great silence. They had just slipped into the street and reached the outer boulevards. Then all six of them, holding each other by the arms, occupying the width of the roadways, went away, dressed in light, with their ribbons tied around their bare hair. Their lively eyes, casting slender glances through the pinched corners of their eyelids, they saw everything, they threw back their necks to laugh, showing the fatness of their chins. In the great bursts of gaiety, when a hunchback passed by or an old woman waited for her dog at the corner of the boundary stones, their line broke, some stayed behind, while others pulled them violently; and they swung their hips, snuggled up, and gangled themselves, just to attract the crowd and make their bodices crack under their nascent shapes. The street was theirs; they had grown up there, lifting their skirts along the shops; they still rolled up there to the thighs, to reattach their garters. In the midst of the slow, pale crowd, between the slender trees of the boulevards, their stampede ran thus from the Rochechouart barrier to the Saint-Denis barrier, jostling people, cutting through the groups in zigzags, turning round and dropping words into the streets. bursts of their laughter. And their flowing dresses left behind them the insolence of their youth; they were spread out in the open air, under the harsh light, with the filthy coarseness of hoodlums, desirable and tender like virgins returning from the bath, their necks soaked.","Five or six girls—Nana, Pauline and others—lingered in the courtyard for a time and then took flight altogether into the streets and thence to the outer boulevards. They walked in a line, filling up the whole sidewalk, with ribbons fluttering in their uncovered hair. They managed to see everybody and everything through their downcast lids. The streets were their native heath, as it were, for they had grown up in them. Nana walked in the center and gave her arm to Pauline, and as they were the oldest and tallest of the band, they gave the law to the others and decided where they should go for the day and what they should do.","The games were only an excuse for them to make their escape. Suddenly stillness fell upon the tenement. The girls had glided out into the street and made for the outer Boulevards. Then, linked arm-in-arm across the full breadth of the pavement, they went off, the whole six of them, clad in light colors, with ribbons tied around their bare heads. With bright eyes darting stealthy glances through their partially closed eyelids, they took note of everything, and constantly threw back their necks to laugh, displaying the fleshy part of their chins. They would swing their hips, or group together tightly, or flaunt along with awkward grace, all for the purpose of calling attention to the fact that their forms were filling out."
"- Non, non, merci ! j'en ai jusque-là, répondit la concierge.","- No, no, thank you! I have so far, answered the concierge.","I know how fond you are of salad."" The concierge shook her head.","“No, no, thank you! I’ve already had as much as I can manage,” replied the concierge."
"Toute la boutique riait, même madame Putois qui n'aimait pas les ivrognes. Ce louchon d'Augustine avait un chant de poule, la bouche ouverte, suffoquant. Cependant, Gervaise soupçonnait Coupeau de n'être pas rentré tout droit, d'avoir passé une heure chez les Lorilleux, où il recevait de mauvais conseils. Quand il lui eut juré que non, elle rit à son tour, pleine d'indulgence, ne lui reprochant même pas d'avoir encore perdu une journée de travail.","The whole shop was laughing, even Madame Putois, who didn't like drunks. That squint Augustine was singing a chicken, her mouth open, suffocating. However, Gervaise suspected Coupeau of not having returned home straight, of having spent an hour with the Lorilleuxs, where he was receiving bad advice. When he had sworn no, she laughed in turn, full of indulgence, not even reproaching him for having lost another day of work.","He caught at the table to sustain himself; he had been drinking; a spider web had caught in his dark hair, where many a white thread was apparent. His under jaw dropped a little, and his smile was good natured but silly. Gervaise asked her husband if he had seen the Lorilleuxs in rather a severe tone; when he said no she smiled at him without a word of reproach.","All the shop laughed, even Madame Putois, who did not like drunkards. That squint-eyed Augustine was cackling like a hen, suffocating with her mouth wide open. Gervaise, however, suspected Coupeau of not having come straight home, but of having passed an hour with the Lorilleuxs who were always filling his head with unpleasant ideas. When he swore he had not been near them she laughed also, full of indulgence and not even reproaching him with having wasted another day."
"- Monsieur Coupeau est sur le trottoir d'en face, lui cria Clémence, dès qu'elle l'aperçut. Il a l'air joliment poivré !","""Monsieur Coupeau is on the sidewalk opposite,"" Clemence called out to her as soon as she saw him. It looks nicely peppered!","""Your husband is on the other side of the street,"" said Clémence as soon as she saw Gervaise; ""he is as tipsy as possible!"" Coupeau reeled in, breaking a square of glass with his shoulder as he missed the doorway.","“Monsieur Coupeau is on the other side of the street,” called out Clemence as soon as she caught sight of her. “He looks awfully drunk.”"
"- Moi, je me mettrais à quatre pattes dans un pré, répétait la concierge, la bouche pleine.","""I would get on all fours in a meadow,"" repeated the concierge, her mouth full.","None of the guests were dismayed at the dessert, although they had eaten so enormously.","“I could go on all fours in a meadow,” observed the concierge with her mouth full."
"Il ne trouvait que ça, et c'était déjà bien tendre pour Lalie, qui n'avait jamais été tant gâtée. Elle consola son père. Elle était surtout ennuyée de s'en aller ainsi, avant d'avoir élevé tout à fait ses enfants. Il en prendrait soin, n'est-ce pas ? Elle lui donna de sa voix mourante des détails sur la façon de les arranger, de les tenir propres. Lui, abruti, repris par les fumées de l'ivresse, roulait la tête en la regardant passer de ses yeux ronds. Ça remuait en lui toutes sortes de choses ; mais il ne trouvait plus rien, et avait la couenne trop brûlée pour pleurer.","That was all he thought, and it was already very tender for Lalie, who had never been so spoiled. She consoled her father. Above all, she was annoyed at going away like this, before she had completely brought up her children. He would take care of it, wouldn't he? She gave him in her dying voice details of how to arrange them, to keep them clean. He, dazed, taken over by the fumes of intoxication, rolled his head as he watched her pass through his round eyes. It stirred all sorts of things in him; but he couldn't find anything, and his skin was too burned to cry.","This was all he said, but it was very sweet to Lalie, who had never been spoiled by overpraise. She comforted him. She told him how grieved she was to go away and leave him before she had entirely brought up her children. He would watch over them, would he not? And in her dying voice she gave him some little details in regard to their clothes. He—the alcohol having regained its power—listened with round eyes of wonder.","Those were the only words he could find to say, and yet they were very tender ones to Lalie, who had never been much spoiled. She consoled her father. What especially worried her was to go off like this without having completely brought up the little ones. He would take care of them, would he not? With her dying breath she told him how they ought to be cared for and kept clean. But stultified, with the fumes of drink seizing hold of him again, he wagged his head, watching her with an uncertain stare as she was dying. All kind of things were touched in him, but he could find no more to say and he was too utterly burnt with liquor to shed a tear."
"Et, dès lors, elle s'appelèrent gros comme le bras madame Poisson et madame Coupeau, uniquement pour le plaisir d'être des dames, elles qui s'étaient connues autrefois dans des positions peu catholiques. Cependant, Gervaise conservait un fond de méfiance. Peut-être bien que la grande brune se raccommodait pour se mieux venger de la fessée du lavoir, en roulant quelque plan de mauvaise bête hypocrite. Gervaise se promettait de rester sur ses gardes. Pour le quart d'heure, Virginie se montrait trop gentille, il fallait bien être gentille aussi.","And, from then on, they called each other fat like the arm Madame Poisson and Madame Coupeau, solely for the pleasure of being ladies, they who had known each other in the past in positions that were not very Catholic. However, Gervaise retained a fund of mistrust. Perhaps the tall brunette was making up for better revenge for the washhouse's spanking, by rolling up some plan of some bad hypocritical beast. Gervaise promised herself to remain on her guard. For the quarter of an hour, Virginie was too nice, you had to be nice too.",Gervaise was a little suspicious of all this courtesy. Might not some terrible revenge be hidden under it all? And she determined to be well on her guard. But as Virginie was so polite just now she must be polite in her turn.,"And from that time forth, they called each other on every possible occasion Madame Poisson and Madame Coupeau, solely for the pleasure of being madame, they who in former days had been acquainted when occupying rather questionable positions. However, Gervaise felt rather mistrustful at heart. Perhaps the tall brunette had made it up the better to avenge herself for the beating at the wash-house by concocting some plan worthy of a spiteful hypocritical creature. Gervaise determined to be upon her guard. For the time being, as Virginie behaved so nicely, she would be nice also."
