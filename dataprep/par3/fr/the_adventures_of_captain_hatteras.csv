Then Mr Bellot tied on his books and said he wanted to go and see how the ice was floating; he had only been gone four minutes, when I went to look for him everywhere on the floe we were on; but I couldn’t see him and when I returned to our shelter I noticed his stick on the other side of a crevasse, about thirty feet wide and where the ice was all broken up. I called out but got no reply. At that moment the wind was blowing very strongly. I again searched the floe, but could find no trace of the poor lieutenant.’"
"– Avantage évident, reprit le docteur ; cependant cette immensité me prouve une chose : c’est que nous devons être fort éloignés de toute terre ; en général, l’approche des côtes est signalée par une multitude de montagnes de glaces, et pas un ice-berg n’est visible autour de nous.","“Obvious advantage,” resumed the doctor; however this immensity proves one thing to me: it is that we must be very far from any land; in general, the approach to the coasts is marked by a multitude of mountains of ice, and not an iceberg is visible around us.","""A decided advantage,"" continued the doctor; ""still, this immensity proves one thing to me, and that is that we are far distant from any land; in general, the proximity of land is indicated by a number of icebergs, and not one is to be seen near us.""","‘A clear advantage. However, this immensity proves one thing to me: we must be a long way from any land. Generally speaking, near the coast there are lots of ice mountains, but we can’t see a single iceberg.’"
"Le soir, le Forward fut en vue de la baie d’Elwin, que l’on reconnut à ses hautes roches perpendiculaires ; le mardi matin, on aperçut la baie Batty, où, le 10 septembre 1851, le Prince-Albert s’ancra pour un long hivernage.

"Hatteras, résolu à marcher en ligne droite, pour ne pas être entraîné au-delà de l’île, ne quitta guère son poste pendant les jours suivants ; il montait fréquemment dans les barres de perroquet pour choisir les passes avantageuses. Tout ce que peuvent faire l’habileté, le sang-froid, l’audace, le génie même d’un marin, il le fit pendant cette traversée du détroit.

It is true that fortune did not favor him, for at that season he ought to have found the sea nearly open. But by dint of sparing neither steam, his men, nor himself, he succeeded in his aim.","* Hatteras was determined to follow a straight line so as not to miss the island, and hardly left his post the following days; he often climbed to the cross-trees of the top gallant sails to choose the most promising passes.

"– Mes amis, dit-il d’une voix émue, merci pour votre courage, merci pour votre persévérance, merci pour vos efforts surhumains qui nous ont permis de mettre le pied sur cette terre !","– My friends, he said in a moved voice, thank you for your courage, thank you for your perseverance, thank you for your superhuman efforts which enabled us to set foot on this earth!","""My friends,"" he said with emotion, ""thanks for your courage, thanks for your perseverance, thanks for your superhuman efforts, which have allowed us to set foot on this land!""","‘My friends,’ he said emotionally, ‘thank you for your courage; thank you for your perseverance; thank you for your superhuman efforts, which have enabled us to set foot on this land!’"
"Hatteras ne pouvait recourir à ce moyen sur un champ de glace peut-être mobile ; en terre ferme, ces dépôts eussent été praticables, mais non à travers les ice-fields, et les incertitudes de la route rendaient fort problématique un retour aux endroits déjà parcourus.","Hatteras could not resort to this means on a possibly mobile ice field; on dry land, these deposits would have been passable, but not through the ice-fields, and the uncertainties of the route made it very problematic to return to the places already covered.",Hatteras could not employ this device on an ice-field which perhaps was moving; on firm land it would have been possible; and the uncertainty of their route made it doubtful whether they would return by the same path.,"Hatteras could not resort to this method on an ice-field that was perhaps moving; on dry land these dumps would have been practicable, but not here, for the uncertainties of the route meant they might easily not return the same way."
"– Mais vous, demanda Hatteras d’une voix rapide, vous ne vous élanciez donc pas, comme nous, sur la route du pôle ?","""But you,"" asked Hatteras in a rapid voice, ""are you not setting off, like us, on the road to the pole?""","""But you,"" asked Hatteras, hurriedly, ""were you not on your way to the Pole?""","‘But what about you?’ asked Hatteras keenly. ‘You weren’t heading for the Pole, like us?’"
"– Hatteras, lui dit le docteur, assez ! nous n’en pouvons plus.","“Hatteras,” said the doctor, “enough! we can't take it anymore.","""Hatteras,"" said the doctor, ""this is far enough! we can't go any farther!""","‘Hatteras,’ the doctor said to him, ‘enough! We can’t take a single step more.’"
– Mais plus spécialement ? s’écria Shandon.,– But more specifically? cried Shandon.,"""But more precisely?"" cried Shandon.","‘But in particular?’ ‘In particular, I have heard that it is to sail towards the boreal seas."
"– Évaluons d’abord le dégât, reprit le docteur, et nous en parlerons après.","“Let’s assess the damage first,” continued the doctor, “and we’ll talk about it later.","""Let us first estimate the loss,"" interrupted the doctor, ""and we'll talk about it afterwards.""","‘Let’s assess the damage,’ replied the doctor, ‘and then we can discuss it.’"
"– Que veux-tu dire, Waren ? reprit Garry en le regardant fixement.","“What do you mean, Warren? Garry continued, staring at him.","""What do you mean, Warren?"" asked Garry, looking at him intently.","‘What do you mean, Waren?’ said Garry, staring at him."
"– Ah ! monsieur Clawbonny, monsieur Clawbonny ! répétait Johnson en embrassant les mains du docteur.","– Ah! Mr. Clawbonny, Mr. Clawbonny! repeated Johnson, kissing the doctor's hands.","""Ah, Clawbonny, Dr. Clawbonny!"" cried Johnson, kissing the doctor's hands.","‘Ah, Dr Clawbonny, Dr Clawbonny!’ repeated Johnson, kissing the doctor’s hands."
"En effet, l’ouragan avait fait place nette dans le bassin polaire ; les glaces, brisées et disloquées, s’en allaient dans toutes les directions ; les plus grosses, formant des ice-bergs, venaient de « lever l’ancre », suivant l’expression des marins, et voguaient en pleine mer. Le champ avait subi un rude assaut de la part du vent ; une grêle de lames minces, de bavures et de poussière de glace était répandue sur les rochers environnants. Le peu qui restait de l’ice-field à l’arasement du rivage paraissait pourri ; sur les rocs, où déferlait le flot, s’allongeaient de larges algues marines et des touffes d’un varech décoloré.","In fact, the hurricane had cleared the way in the polar basin; the ice, broken and dislocated, flew off in all directions; the larger ones, forming icebergs, had just “weighed anchor,” as sailors say, and were sailing out to sea. The field had suffered a rough attack from the wind; a hail of thin blades, burrs and ice dust was spread on the surrounding rocks. The little that remained of the ice-field at the leveling of the shore seemed rotten; on the rocks, where the waves broke, lay large seaweeds and tufts of discolored kelp.","In fact, the hurricane had cleared up the polar basin; the shattered ice was floating away in every direction; the largest pieces, forming icebergs, had just weighed anchor and were sailing on the open sea. The wind had made a harsh attack upon the field. Fragments of ice covered the surrounding rocks. The little which was left of the ice-field seemed very soft; on the rocks were large pieces of sea-weed.","The storm had in effect removed everything from the polar basin; the ice, cracked and broken up, was moving off in all directions; the largest pieces, forming icebergs, had just raised anchor, as the maritime expression has it, and were sailing over the open sea. The field had suffered from the attack of the wind; a hail of thin blades, barbs, and ice dust covered the rocks nearby. The little which remained of the ice-field, on the shoulder of the shore, was crumbling; on the rocks, where the waves were breaking, were stretched out large pieces of seaweed and clumps of a pale varec."
"À neuf heures du matin, tout fut terminé. Il était temps ; les ours se livraient avec furie à leur rage de démolition.","At nine o'clock in the morning, it was all over. It was time ; the bears indulged furiously in their demolition rage.","At nine of the morning all was finished, and it was time; the bears were tearing the snow away furiously.",By nine everything was finished. It was time; the bears were furiously demolishing the ice.
"Le vendredi, 8 juin, il arriva près de la côte de Boothia, à l’entrée du détroit de James Ross, qu’il fallait éviter à tout prix, car il n’a d’issue qu’à l’ouest, et aboutit directement aux terres d’Amérique.","On Friday, June 8, he arrived near the coast of Boothia, at the entrance to James Ross Strait, which had to be avoided at all costs, as it has no outlet except to the west, and leads directly to the lands of America.","Friday, June 7th,* she arrived near the coast of Boothia, at the entrance of James Ross Sound, which had to be avoided because its only exit is to the west, close to the shore of America.","On Friday, 8 June she was near the coast of Boothia, at the entrance to James Ross Strait, which had to be avoided at all costs, as it has no way out westwards * and leads directly to the lands of America."
"Une heure avant d’arriver au Forward, il survint un phénomène qui excita au plus haut degré l’étonnement du docteur. Ce fut une véritable pluie d’étoiles filantes ; on pouvait les compter par milliers, comme les fusées dans un bouquet de feu d’artifice d’une blancheur éclatante ; la lumière de la lune pâlissait. L’œil ne pouvait se lasser d’admirer ce phénomène qui dura plusieurs heures. Pareil météore fut observé au Groënland par les Frères Moraves en 1799. On eut dit une véritable fête que le ciel donnait à la terre sous ces latitudes désolées. Le docteur, de retour à bord, passa la nuit entière à suivre la marche de ce météore, qui cessa vers les sept heures du matin, au milieu du profond silence de l’atmosphère.","An hour before arriving at the Forward, a phenomenon occurred which excited the doctor's astonishment in the highest degree. It was a veritable shower of shooting stars; they could be counted in the thousands, like the rockets in a bouquet of dazzlingly white fireworks; the moonlight was fading. The eye could not get tired of admiring this phenomenon which lasted several hours. Such a meteor was observed in Greenland by the Moravian Brethren in 1799. It looked like a veritable feast that the sky gave to the earth in these desolate latitudes. The doctor, back on board, spent the whole night following the course of this meteor, which ceased about seven o'clock in the morning, in the midst of the profound silence of the atmosphere.","An hour before reaching the Forward, there was a singular phenomenon which greatly interested the doctor. It was a real shower of shooting-stars; they could be counted by thousands, flying over the heavens like rockets; they dimmed the light of the moon. For hours they could have stood gazing at this beautiful sight. A similar phenomenon was observed in Greenland in 1799, by the Moravians. It looked like an exhibition of fireworks. The doctor after his return to the ship spent the whole night gazing at the sight, which lasted till seven o'clock in the morning, while the air was perfectly silent. * * *","An hour away from the Forward, something else astonished the doctor. Shooting stars were raining down; there were thousands, like rockets at the climax of a fireworks display. The moonlight was pale. One’s eye could never tire of looking at such a show, which lasted several hours. A few Moravian Brothers observed a similar occurrence in Greenland in 1799. * It was like a carnival the heavens were putting on for the land at these desolate latitudes. Back on board, the doctor spent the whole night watching the phenomenon, which stopped at about seven in the morning, with a deep silence in the atmosphere."
"La glace s’étendait en longs miroirs ternis sur le plancher ; un épais brouillard envahissait la salle ; l’humidité retombait en neige épaisse ; on ne se voyait plus ; la chaleur humaine se retirait des extrémités du corps ; les pieds et les mains devenaient bleus ; la tête se cerclait de fer, et la pensée confuse, amoindrie, gelée, portait au délire. Symptôme effrayant : la langue ne pouvait plus articuler une parole.","The mirror stretched out in long dull mirrors on the floor; a thick fog invaded the room; the damp fell like thick snow; we no longer saw each other; human warmth withdrew from the extremities of the body; feet and hands turned blue; the head was encircled with iron, and the confused, lessened, frozen thoughts led to delirium. Scary symptom: the tongue could no longer articulate a word.","The ice stretched in long, dark lines upon the floor; a dense mist filled the room; the dampness fell in the form of thick snow; the men could not see one another; their extremities grew cold and blue; their heads felt as if they wore an iron band; and their thoughts grew confused and dull, as if they were half delirious. A terrible symptom was that their tongues refused to articulate a sound.","The ice stretched over the floor in long dull mirrors; a thick fog invaded the room; the humidity fell as thick snow; they could no longer see each other; the heat withdrew from the extremities of their bodies; feet and hands became blue; an iron band circled their heads, and their thoughts, confused, slowed down, frozen, tended towards delirium. A frightening symptom: tongues could no longer articulate words."
"Le brick fut construit avec une solidité à toute épreuve ; il était évidemment appelé à résister à d’énormes pressions, car sa membrure en bois de teack, sorte de chêne des Indes remarquable par son extrême dureté, fut en outre reliée par de fortes armatures de fer. On se demandait même dans le monde des marins pourquoi la coque d’un navire établi dans ces conditions de résistance n’était pas faite de tôle, comme celle des autres bâtiments à vapeur. À cela, on répondait que l’ingénieur mystérieux avait ses raisons pour agir ainsi.","The brig was built with unfailing solidity; it was obviously called upon to resist enormous pressures, because its frame made of teak wood, a kind of Indian oak remarkable for its extreme hardness, was also connected by strong iron frames. People even wondered in the world of sailors why the hull of a ship established under these conditions of resistance was not made of sheet metal, like that of other steamships. To this, it was answered that the mysterious engineer had his reasons for doing so.","Every care was taken to have the brig made exceedingly strong; it was evidently intended to withstand enormous pressure, for its ribs of teak, an East Indian wood remarkable for its solidity, were further strengthened by thick iron braces. The sailors used to ask why the hull of a ship, which was intended to be so strong, was not made of iron like other steamers. But they were told that the mysterious designer had his own reasons for having it built in that way.","The brig was of a solidity to withstand any force. She had clearly been designed for enormous pressures, since her frame of teak, a sort of Indian oak renowned for its exceptional hardness, was in addition reinforced with thick iron hoops. It was even wondered, in the world of sailors, why the hull of a ship built according to such specifications of resistance was not made from metal plate, like other steamships. To that it was replied that the mysterious engineer must have had good reasons for his decision."
"– Hé ! hé ! fit le docteur ; je croyais comme vous que cet homme vous laisserait le commandement du navire, et ne viendrait jamais à bord ; mais….","- Hey ! Hey ! said the doctor; I believed like you that this man would leave you the command of the ship, and would never come on board; but….","Besides, you know what I think about him."" ""Ha, ha!"" laughed the doctor; ""I used to think as you did, that he was going to leave the command of the ship in your hands, and that he would never come on board; but—""","But anyway, you know what I think of him.’ ‘Ha ha, like you I thought he’d given up command of the ship, and wouldn’t arrive on board."
"– Des ours, répondit le docteur ! un ! trois ! cinq !","“Bears,” answered the doctor! a ! three ! five !","""Bears!"" said the doctor; ""one, two, three.""","‘Bears!’ replied the doctor. ‘One, three, five.’"
"Hatteras ne voulut pas mettre son équipage au courant de cette situation nouvelle. Il avait raison. Ces malheureux, se sachant entraînés vers le nord avec une force irrésistible, se fussent livrés peut-être aux folies du désespoir. Le docteur le comprit, et approuva le silence du capitaine.","Hatteras did not want to inform his crew of this new situation. He was right. These unfortunates, knowing that they were being drawn towards the north with an irresistible force, would perhaps have given themselves up to the follies of despair. The doctor understood this, and approved of the captain's silence.","Hatteras did not wish to let his crew know about this new condition of affairs. He was right. If they had known that they were being driven towards the north with irresistible force, they would have given way to despair. The doctor knew this, and approved of the captain's silence.","Hatteras was reluctant to inform his crew of the new situation. He was right. These wretches, knowing themselves dragged northwards with irresistible force, would perhaps have gone mad with despair. The doctor understood and approved the captain’s silence."
"– Nous n’avons pas même un instrument, une lunette dont nous puissions enlever la lentille pour nous procurer du feu.","– We do not even have an instrument, a telescope whose lens we can remove to obtain fire.","""We have not even an instrument, a glass from which we might take the lens to get fire by means of it!""","‘We don’t have even an instrument, a telescope whose lens we could take out to make fire.’"
– Qu’est-ce que mon nez t’a fait ? répondit brusquement le matelot attaqué à son endroit sensible. Mon nez n’a pas besoin de tes conseils ; il ne te les demande pas ; mêle-toi donc de ce qui regarde le tien !,"""What did my nose do to you?"" abruptly answered the sailor attacked at his sensitive spot. My nose does not need your advice; he does not ask you for them; meddle then in what concerns yours!","""Don't trouble yourself about my nose,"" was the answer, for Pen was rather vexed. ""My nose doesn't need your advice; it doesn't ask for it; you'd better mind your own business.""","‘What’s my nose got to do with it?’ roughly replied the sailor, attacked at his weak point. ‘My nose doesn’t need your advice; it doesn’t ask for it, so mind your own nose’s business!’"
"Les forces des voyageurs s’étaient promptement refaites ; les chiens avaient eu large part des débris de l’ours, et l’on reprit rapidement le chemin du nord.","The strength of the travelers had quickly recovered; the dogs had had a large share of the remains of the bear, and they quickly resumed the north road.","The strength of the travellers soon returned; the dogs had eaten freely of the bear's flesh, and they continued their journey northward.","The travellers’ strength had quickly come back; the dogs had had their fill of the remains of the bear, and all quickly set off north again."
"– Est-ce également votre avis, Bell ? demanda Hatteras.","“Is that also your opinion, Bell?” Hatteras asked.","""Is that your opinion, Bell?"" asked Hatteras.","‘Is that your opinion too, Bell?’"
– À quoi songez-vous ? demanda Hatteras.,– What are you thinking? Hatteras asked.,"""What are you thinking of?"" asked Hatteras.",‘What are you thinking?’ demanded Hatteras.
"– Comme tu dis, Bell, répliqua Johnson ; et nous apprendrez-vous, monsieur Clawbonny, quelle est la vitesse de ce mouvement de translation ?","“As you say, Bell,” replied Johnson; and will you tell us, Mr. Clawbonny, what is the speed of this translational movement?","""You are right, Bell,"" answered Johnson; ""and will you tell us, Doctor, how fast this motion is?""","Lesson in Polar Cosmography 327 ‘As you say, Bell,’ said Johnson, ‘and will you tell us, Dr Clawbonny, the speed of this movement of translation?’"
"Le jeudi, vers les trois heures du matin, le Forward arriva en vue de la baie Possession, sur la côte d’Amérique, à l’entrée du détroit de Lancastre ; bientôt le cap Burney fut entrevu. Quelques Esquimaux se dirigèrent vers le navire ; mais Hatteras ne prit pas le loisir de les attendre.","On Thursday, about three o'clock in the morning, the Forward arrived in sight of Possession Bay, on the coast of America, at the entrance to Lancaster Sound; soon Cape Burney was glimpsed. A few Eskimos walked towards the ship; but Hatteras did not take the time to wait for them.","Thursday, at about three o'clock in the morning, the Forward arrived in sight of Possession Bay, on the American shore, at the entrance of Lancaster Sound; soon Cape Burney came into sight. A few Esquimaux came out to the ship; but Hatteras could not stop to speak with them.","On Thursday, at about three in the morning, the Forward arrived in sight of Possession Bay, on the American coast and at the entrance to Lancaster Sound; soon Burney Cape* was glimpsed. A few Expeditions in Search of Franklin 81 Eskimos headed for the ship but Hatteras did not waste time waiting for them."
"Les pensées de chacun se rapportaient en effet à la situation présente ; les esprits étaient en proie à cette prédominante idée du pôle Nord. Dangers bravés pour l’atteindre, périls à vaincre pour en revenir, s’oubliaient dans ce succès sans précédent. Ce que ni les anciens, ni les modernes, ce que ni les Européens, ni les Américains, ni les Asiatiques n’avaient pu faire jusqu’ici, venait d’être accompli.","Everyone's thoughts were indeed related to the present situation; minds were prey to this predominant idea of the North Pole. Dangers braved to reach it, perils to overcome to return, were forgotten in this unprecedented success. What neither the ancients nor the moderns, what neither the Europeans, nor the Americans, nor the Asians had been able to do until now, had just been accomplished.","The thoughts of each one were about their situation. They had no other idea than the North Pole. The dangers they had undergone to reach it, those to overcome before returning, were forgotten in their unprecedented success. What neither Europeans, Americans, nor Asiatics had been able to do, they had accomplished.","Everyone’s thoughts were about the present situation; their minds were full of the sole idea of the North Pole. In this unique victory, they forgot the dangers braved reaching it and the perils still to overcome to get back. What neither the ancients nor the moderns, what neither the Europeans nor the Americans nor the Asians had yet been able to do, had just been accomplished."
"Le Forward, destiné à une navigation dans les mers arctiques, offrait l’aménagement le meilleur pour un hivernage : la grande chambre de l’équipage était sagement disposée ; on y avait fait la guerre aux coins où l’humidité se réfugie d’abord ; en effet, par certains abaissements de température, une couche de glace se forme sur les cloisons, dans les coins particulièrement, et, quand elle vient à se fondre, elle entretient une humidité constante. Circulaire, la salle de l’équipage eût encore mieux convenu ; mais enfin, chauffée par un vaste poêle, et convenablement ventilée, elle devait être très habitable ; les murs étaient tapissés de peaux de daims, et non d’étoffes de laine, car la laine arrête les vapeurs qui s’y condensent, et imprègnent l’atmosphère d’un principe humide.","The Forward, intended for navigation in the Arctic seas, offered the best layout for wintering: the large crew room was wisely laid out; war had been waged there on the corners where moisture first takes refuge; in fact, by certain reductions in temperature, a layer of ice forms on the partitions, particularly in the corners, and, when it melts, it maintains a constant humidity. Circular, the crew room would have been even better suited; but finally, heated by a large stove, and suitably ventilated, it must have been very habitable; the walls were lined with deer skins, and not with woolen stuffs, for wool stops the vapors which condense there, and impregnate the atmosphere with a humid principle.","The Forward, being destined to a journey in arctic seas, contained the best arrangements for winter-quarters: the large room for the crew was well provided for; the corners, where dampness first forms, were shut off; in fact, when the temperature is very low, a film of ice forms on the walls, especially in the corners, and when it melts it keeps up a perpetual dampness. If it had been round, the room would have been more convenient; but, being heated by a large stove, and properly ventilated, it was very comfortable; the walls were lined with deerskins, not with wool, for wool absorbs the condensed moisture and keeps the air full of dampness.","The Forward was designed for navigation in Arctic seas, and so had an ideal layout for wintering; the main crew room was wisely planned; corners, where humidity gathers first, had been eliminated; in effect when the temperature drops, a deposit of ice forms in the corners of the open spaces, and when it melts it produces constant humidity. A circular crew room would have been even better; but, heated by a huge stove and suitably ventilated, the room would surely be perfectly liveable; the walls were covered with buckskin,* and not woollen material, for wool traps the water vapour as condensation, which then fills the air."
– Voilà qui est curieux ! dit le docteur.,– That is curious! said the doctor.,"""That's strange,"" said the doctor.",‘That is strange!’ ‘Are you surprised?’ asked the commandant with a laugh.
"– Précisément, reprit le docteur.","“Precisely,” resumed the doctor.","""Exactly,"" said the doctor.",‘Exactly.’
"– Qu’on m’en donne l’ordre, reprit Brunton, et mes fourneaux seront bientôt allumés.","""Give me the order,"" resumed Brunton, ""and my furnaces will soon be lit.""","""Only give me the order,"" resumed Brunton, ""and my fires shall be lighted.""","‘Just give me the order,’ said Brunton, ‘and my boilers will soon be burning.’"
"En parlant ainsi, Hatteras était en proie à une exaltation violente, à une sorte de fièvre, et le docteur essayait en vain de le calmer. Ses yeux brillaient d’un éclat extraordinaire, et ses pensées bouillonnaient dans son cerveau. Clawbonny attribua cet état de surexcitation aux épouvantables périls que le capitaine venait de traverser.","While speaking thus, Hatteras was in the grip of a violent exaltation, a kind of fever, and the doctor tried in vain to calm him. His eyes shone with an extraordinary brilliance, and his thoughts were boiling in his brain. Clawbonny attributed this state of excitement to the terrible perils the captain had just passed through.","As he spoke, Hatteras was the victim of a violent excitement, a sort of fever, and the doctor in vain tried to calm him. His eyes were strangely bright, and his thoughts were boiling within him. Clawbonny ascribed this condition to the terrible perils he had gone through.","Speaking thus, Hatteras was prey to violent exultation, a sort of fever, and in vain did the doctor try to calm him down. His eyes shone with extraordinary brightness and thoughts boiled in his mind. Clawbonny attributed this state of over-excitement to the terrifying dangers the captain had passed through."
"Par politique ou par instinct, Altamont fut tout d’abord entraîné vers le docteur ; il lui devait la vie, mais la sympathie le poussait vers ce digne homme plus encore que la reconnaissance. Tel était l’inévitable effet du caractère du digne Clawbonny ; les amis poussaient autour de lui comme les blés au soleil. On a cité des gens qui se levaient à cinq heures du matin pour se faire des ennemis ; le docteur se fût levé à quatre sans y réussir.","Either by policy or by instinct, Altamont was first drawn to the doctor; he owed him his life, but sympathy urged him towards this worthy man even more than gratitude. Such was the inevitable effect of the worthy Clawbonny's character; friends grew around him like wheat in the sun. People have been quoted who got up at five in the morning to make enemies; the doctor would have gotten up at four without succeeding.","Either from policy or instinctively, Altamont was at first attracted towards the doctor; it was to him he owed his life, but it was sympathy rather than gratitude which moved him. This was the invariable effect of Clawbonny's nature; friends grew about him like wheat under the summer sun. Every one has heard of people who rise at five o'clock in the morning to make enemies; the doctor could have got up at four without doing it.","By design or instinct, Altamont was immediately drawn to the doctor; he owed him his life, but he was impelled less by gratitude than by sympathy for the good man. Such was the invariable effect of the worthy Clawbonny’s character; friends grew around him like wheat in the sun. Some people are reputed to get up at five in the morning to make enemies; the doctor could have got up at four without making any."
"– Il faut avouer, dit Johnson, sans être entendu d’Altamont, que si nous trouvions la place prise, ce serait à dégoûter de faire un voyage au pôle !","“It must be confessed,” said Johnson, without being heard by Altamont, “that if we find the place taken, it would be disgusting to make a trip to the pole!","""We must confess,"" said Johnson, without being heard by Altamont, ""that if we find the place taken, it would disgust us with journeying to the Pole.""","‘It must be admitted’, added Johnson without Altamont being able to hear him, ‘that if we found sitting tenants it’d make us want to give up on the Pole!’"
"– Il finira nécessairement par les connaître, car nous ne pouvons pas le laisser seul ici ?","""He's bound to get to know them eventually, because we can't leave him here alone?""","""He will know them finally, of course, for we can't leave him alone here."" ""Why not?""","‘He’ll have to find out at some stage, for we can’t leave him here alone.’ ‘Why not?’"
"Tout fut disposé à l’intérieur pour combattre les deux grands ennemis de ces latitudes, le froid et l’humidité ; le premier amenait le second, plus redoutable encore ; on résiste au froid, on succombe à l’humidité ; il s’agissait donc de la prévenir.","Everything was arranged inside to combat the two great enemies of these latitudes, the cold and the humidity; the first led to the second, more formidable still; one resists the cold, one succumbs to the humidity; it was therefore a question of preventing it.","Every preparation was made to fight the two great enemies of this latitude, cold and dampness; the first produces the second, which is far more dangerous. The cold may be resisted by one who succumbs to dampness; hence it was necessary to guard against it.","Everything was arranged inside to combat the two great enemies at these latitudes: cold and humidity; the first produced the second, still more redoubtable; cold can be resisted, but humidity kills; so it needed to be prevented."
"Au commencement de cette phrase, Hatteras avait saisi une hache ; à la fin, cette hache était levée sur la tête de Pen.","At the beginning of this sentence, Hatteras had seized an axe; at the end, this ax was raised over Pen's head.","At the beginning of this sentence Hatteras had grasped an axe; at its end, this axe was raised above Pen's head.",At the beginning of this sentence Hatteras picked up a hatchet; at the end it was raised above Pen’s head.
"Et puis enfin, ils allaient marcher au but du voyage, à ce pôle inaccessible, après quoi il ne serait plus question que du retour. La sympathie qui réunissait maintenant les cinq membres de l’expédition devait les aider à réussir dans leur audacieux voyage, et pas un d’eux ne doutait du succès de l’entreprise.","And then finally, they were going to walk to the goal of the journey, to this inaccessible pole, after which there would be no question of anything but the return. The sympathy which now united the five members of the expedition was to help them succeed in their daring journey, and not one of them doubted the success of the enterprise.","And then, too, they were going to the end of their journey, to the inaccessible Pole, after which their only thought would be of returning. The sympathy which bound together the five members of the expedition would aid their success in this bold trip, and no one doubted of their success.","Finally they were going to march towards the aim of their journey, the unreachable Pole, after which they only had the question of the return to deal with. The friendship which now united the expedition would surely help them to succeed in their audacious journey, and no one doubted the success of their endeavour."
"C’était un animal de belle taille ; il mesurait près de quinze pieds de long depuis son museau jusqu’à l’extrémité de sa queue, et il eût certainement fourni plusieurs barriques d’huile.","It was a good-sized animal; it was nearly fifteen feet long from its muzzle to the end of its tail, and it would certainly have provided several barrels of oil.","He was a good-sized animal, being nearly fifteen feet long from his muzzle to the end of his tail, and he would certainly furnish many barrels of oil.",It was a fine animal; it measured nearly fifteen feet from tip to tail; it would certainly have provided several barrels of oil.

"– Il y a, répondit Hatteras, cette mer immense qui nous environne, et dont pas un navire n’a encore sillonné les flots.","“There is,” replied Hatteras, “that immense sea which surrounds us, and whose waves not a ship has yet sailed.","""There is,"" said Hatteras, ""this immense sea which surrounds us, and in which no ship has ever floated.""","‘There is the huge sea surrounding us, and whose waves have never been sailed by a ship.’"
"– Bref, le fatal document nous l’apprend encore, sir John Franklin succombe à ses fatigues, le 11 juin 1847. Honneur à sa mémoire ! dit le docteur en se découvrant.","– In short, the fatal document teaches us again, Sir John Franklin succumbed to his fatigues, June 11, 1847.

"– Suivons-le encore, répondit le docteur. Au mois de mars, réduit à deux tiers de ration, à la suite d’un hiver très rigoureux où le gibier manqua. Mac Clure se décida à renvoyer en Angleterre la moitié de son équipage, soit par la mer de Baffin, soit par la rivière Mackensie et la baie d’Hudson ; l’autre moitié devait ramener l’Investigator en Europe. Il choisit les hommes les moins valides, auxquels un quatrième hivernage eût été funeste ; tout était prêt pour leur départ, fixé au 15 avril, quand le 6, se promenant avec son lieutenant Creswell sur les glaces, Mac Clure aperçut, accourant du nord et gesticulant, un homme, et cet homme, c’était le lieutenant Pim, du Herald, le lieutenant de ce même capitaine Kellet, qu’il avait laissé deux ans auparavant au détroit de Behring, comme je vous l’ai dit en commençant. Kellet, parvenu à Winter-Harbour, avait trouvé le document laissé à tout hasard par Mac Clure ; ayant appris de la sorte sa situation dans la baie de la Mercy, il envoya son lieutenant Pim au-devant du hardi capitaine. Le lieutenant était suivi d’un détachement de marins du Herald, parmi lesquels se trouvait un enseigne de vaisseau français, M. de Bray, qui servait comme volontaire dans l’état-major du capitaine Kellet. Vous ne mettez pas en doute cette rencontre de nos compatriotes !","""Let's follow him again,"" replied the doctor. In March, reduced to two-thirds of ration, following a very harsh winter when there was a shortage of game. MacClure decided to send half his crew back to England, either by Baffin Bay or by the Mackensie River and Hudson Bay; the other half was to bring the Investigator back to Europe. He chose the less able-bodied men, to whom a fourth wintering would have been disastrous; everything was ready for their departure, fixed for the 15th of April, when on the 6th, walking with his lieutenant Creswell on the ice, MacClure saw, running up from the north and gesticulating, a man, and this man was Lieutenant Pim, of the Herald, the lieutenant of this same Captain Kellet, whom he had left two years before at Behring Strait, as I told you at the beginning. Kellet, having reached Winter Harbour, had found the document left by McClure; having thus learned of his situation in Mercy Bay, he sent his lieutenant Pim to meet the bold captain. The lieutenant was followed by a detachment of sailors from the Herald, among whom was a French ensign, M. de Bray, who served as a volunteer on Captain Kellet's staff. You do not doubt this meeting of our compatriots!","""Let us follow him again,"" resumed the doctor. ""In the month of March, being on two-thirds rations, at the end of a very severe winter, when no game was to be had, MacClure determined to send back half of his crew to England, either by Baffin's Bay, or by Mackenzie River and Hudson's Bay; the other half was to bring the Investigator back. He chose the weakest men, who could not stand a fourth winter; everything was ready, and their departure settled for April 15th, when on the 6th, MacClure, who was walking on the ice with his lieutenant, Creswell, saw a man running northward and gesticulating; it was Lieutenant Pim of the Herald, lieutenant of the same Captain Kellet whom two years before he had left at Behring Strait, as I said when I began. Kellet, having reached Winter Harbor, found the paper left there by MacClure; having heard in that way of his position in Mercy Bay, he sent Lieutenant Pim to meet the captain. He was followed by a detachment of the men of the Herald, among whom was a midshipman of a French ship, M. de Bray, who was a volunteer aid of Captain Kellet. You don't doubt this meeting?""","‘Let’s follow him further. In March, they were reduced to two-thirds rations, after a very hard winter in which game was absent. McClure decided to send half his crew back to Britain, either via Baffin Bay or the Mackenzie River and Hudson Bay; the other half were to take the Investigator back to Europe. He chose the weakest men, for whom a fourth wintering would have been fatal; everything was ready for departure, planned for 15 April, when on the sixth, walking on the ice with his lieutenant, Cresswell, McClure saw a man running from the north and waving his arms; this man was Lieutenant Pim from the Herald, the lieutenant of the same Captain Kellett whom he had left two years before on Bering Strait, as I mentioned at the beginning. Kellett had reached Winter Harbour, and found the document McClure left just in case; having learned in this way his position in Mercy Bay, he sent Lieutenant Pim* to meet the daring captain. The lieutenant was accompanied by a detachment of sailors from the Herald, amongst them a sub-lieutenant from a French vessel, M. de Bray,* serving as a volunteer on Captain Kellett’s staff. You don’t dispute this meeting between our compatriots?’"
"– Ainsi, reprit l’Américain, vous croyez que nous aurions moins à faire pour combattre l’oisiveté, si nous étions en plus grand nombre ?","“So,” continued the American, “you think we would have less to do to combat idleness if we were in greater numbers?","""Do you mean it would be easier for us to combat idleness if there were more of us?"" asked the American.","‘In other words,’ said the American, ‘you think it’d be easier to remain active if there were more of us?’ ‘Without a doubt."

"Le jour revint, et il fut bien constaté que, sous l’influence d’un courant sous-marin, le banc de glace dérivait vers le nord avec rapidité. Cette masse flottante emportait le Forward, cloué au milieu de l’ice-field, dont on ne voyait pas la limite ; dans la prévision d’une catastrophe, dans le cas où le brick serait jeté sur une côte ou écrasé par la pression des glaces, Hatteras fit monter sur le pont une grande quantité de provisions, les effets de campement, les vêtements et les couvertures de l’équipage ; à l’exemple de ce que fit le capitaine MacClure dans une circonstance semblable, il fit entourer le bâtiment d’une ceinture de hamacs gonflés d’air de manière à le prémunir contre les grosses avaries ; bientôt la glace, s’accumulant sous l’influence d’une température de sept degrés (-14° centigrades) ; le navire fut entouré d’une muraille de laquelle sa mâture sortait seule.","The day returned, and it was clearly observed that, under the influence of an undercurrent, the ice bank was drifting rapidly towards the north. This floating mass carried the Forward, nailed to the middle of the ice-field, the limit of which could not be seen; in anticipation of a catastrophe, in case the brig should be thrown on a slope or crushed by the pressure of the ice, Hatteras brought on deck a large quantity of provisions, the camping effects, the clothes and blankets of the crew ; Following the example of what Captain MacClure did in a similar circumstance, he had the vessel surrounded by a belt of hammocks inflated with air so as to protect it against serious damage; soon the ice, accumulating under the influence of a temperature of seven degrees (-14° centigrade); the ship was surrounded by a wall from which its mast alone emerged.","Day broke, and it was evident that under the influence of a submarine current the bank of ice was floating northward with great rapidity. This floating mass carried the Forward with it, in the midst of the ice-field, the edge of which could not be seen; to provide for any accident that might happen, Hatteras had a large supply of provisions carried on deck, as well as materials for camping, clothing, and cover; as MacClure had done under similar circumstances, he surrounded the ship with hammocks filled with air to protect her from damage. Soon it was so cold (7°), that the ship was surrounded by a wall from which only the masts issued.","Day broke, and it was observed that the ice-field was floating north, in a strong submarine current. This floating mass transported the Forward, nailed to the heart of the field, without visible limit; foreseeing catastrophe if the brig was dashed on the coast or crushed by the ice, a large quantity of provisions, camping equipment, and blankets for the crew were brought on deck; like Captain McClure in similar circumstances, Hatteras had the ship protected with a ring of hammocks inflated with air, to prevent the worst damage; with soon a temperature of seven (−14°C) and a build-up of ice, the ship was surrounded by a high wall, only its mast emerging."
"– Eh bien, dit Wall, ce capitaine chimérique ne parle même plus de venir à bord ; j’en conclus qu’il n’y viendra jamais.","'Well,' said Wall, 'that fanciful captain doesn't even talk about coming aboard any more; I conclude that he will never come there.","""Well,"" said Wall, ""this imaginary captain says nothing about coming on board.

Duk, d’ailleurs, se montrait aimable envers la plupart des matelots et des officiers du bord ; seulement, par instinct sans doute, il fuyait la société de Shandon ; il avait aussi conservé une dent, et quelle dent ! contre Pen et Foker ; sa haine pour eux se traduisait en grognements mal contenus à leur approche.

"– Pardon, répondit le docteur ; il y a une grande différence entre se plonger dans l’air chaud ou dans l’eau chaude ; l’air chaud amène une transpiration qui garantit les chairs, tandis que dans l’eau bouillante on ne transpire pas, et l’on se brûle.

"Presque toutes les nuits, le docteur pouvait observer de magnifiques aurores boréales ; de quatre heures à huit heures du soir, le ciel se colorait légèrement dans le nord ; puis, cette coloration prenait la forme régulière d’une bordure jaune pâle, dont les extrémités semblaient s’arc-bouter sur le champ de glace.

"Le mercredi 23 mai, le Forward avait repris son aventureuse navigation, louvoyant adroitement au milieu des packs et des ice-bergs, grâce à sa vapeur, cette force obéissante qui manqua à tant de navigateurs des mers polaires ; il semblait se jouer au milieu de ces écueils mouvants ; on eût dit qu’il reconnaissait la main d’un maître expérimenté, et, comme un cheval sous un écuyer habile, il obéissait à la pensée de son capitaine.","On Wednesday, May 23, the Forward had resumed its adventurous navigation, maneuvering adroitly amid the packs and icebergs, thanks to its steam, that obedient force which so many navigators of the polar seas lacked; it seemed to play among these shifting reefs; one would have said that he recognized the hand of an experienced master, and, like a horse under a skilful rider, he obeyed the thought of his captain.","Wednesday, the 21st of May, the Forward resumed her perilous voyage, making her way dexterously through the packs and icebergs, thanks to steam, which is seldom used by explorers in polar seas; she seemed to sport among the moving masses; one would have said she felt the hand of a skilled master, and that, like a horse under a skilful rider, she obeyed the thought of her captain.","On Wednesday, 23 May the Forward continued her adventurous navigation, tacking skilfully through the packs and icebergs, thanks to her steam, that obedient force unavailable to so many navigators of the polar seas.

"Il n’existait plus une goutte d’eau libre dans ces vastes mers frappées par l’hiver arctique. Les ice-fields se déroulaient à perte de vue, mais sans offrir une surface unie. Loin de là. De nombreux ice-bergs hérissaient la plaine glacée, et le Forward se trouvait abrité par les plus hauts d’entre eux sur trois points du compas ; le vent du sud-est seul soufflait jusqu’à lui. Que l’on suppose des rochers au lieu de glaçons, de la verdure au lieu de neige, et la mer reprenant son état liquide, le brick eût été tranquillement à l’ancre dans une jolie baie et à l’abri des coups de vent les plus redoutables.

The ice-fields stretched as far as the eye could see, but without offering a smooth surface. Far from there.

"L’équipage se montrait généralement enchanté de quitter les régions boréales ; il paraissait peu goûter ce projet d’atteindre le pôle ; il s’effrayait volontiers des résolutions d’Hatteras, dont la réputation d’audace n’avait rien de rassurant.

And yet in the northern seas, advancing is good, but you still have to keep your position, and not put yourself in danger of losing it.","The crew seemed overjoyed at leaving the northern regions; they had but a slight desire to reach the Pole; they were alarmed at Hatteras's plans, for his reputation as a fearless man inspired them with but little confidence.

"Le phoque ne fut bientôt plus qu’à dix pas de son ennemi ; celui-ci se développa tout d’un coup, fit un bond gigantesque, et, stupéfait, épouvanté, s’arrêta à trois pas d’Hatteras, qui, rejetant en arrière sa peau de phoque, un genou en terre, le visait au cœur.","The seal was soon only ten paces from its enemy; the latter suddenly expanded, made a gigantic leap, and, stupefied, terrified, stopped three paces from Hatteras, who, throwing back his sealskin, one knee on the ground, aimed at him in the heart.","The seal had come within ten feet of his enemy; the bear hastened towards him, made a long leap, and stood stupefied three paces from Hatteras, who, casting aside the sealskin, with one knee resting on the ground, was aiming at the bear's heart.","Soon the seal was only ten paces from its adversary.

"Lorsque le bruit de son intronisation à bord du Forward se répandit dans la ville, ses amis mirent tout en œuvre pour le retenir, ce qui l’enracina plus profondément dans son idée ; or, quand le docteur s’était enraciné quelque part, bien habile qui l’eût arraché !","When word of his induction aboard the Forward spread through the town, his friends did everything they could to hold him back, which rooted him more deeply in his idea; now, when the doctor had taken root somewhere, very skilful who would have uprooted him!","When the news of his intended journey on board the Forward became known in the city, all his friends endeavored to dissuade him, but they only made him cling more obstinately to his intention; and when the doctor had absolutely determined on anything, he was a skilful man who could make him change.","When the rumour of his installation on board the Forward spread across the city, his friends moved heaven and earth to hold him back, which entrenched him even more in his idea; and when the doctor had entrenched himself in something, it took considerable skill to prise him out!"
"Pendant les jours suivants, le Forward gagna rapidement dans le nord-ouest ; le vent passa dans le sud, et la mer fut prise d’une grosse houle. Le brick naviguait alors sous pleine voilure. Quelques pétrels et des puffins vinrent voltiger au-dessus de la dunette ; le docteur tua fort adroitement l’un de ces derniers, qui tomba heureusement à bord.","During the following days the Forward gained rapidly in the northwest; the wind changed to the south, and the sea was taken by a big swell. The brig was then sailing under full sail. A few petrels and shearwaters fluttered above the poop; the doctor skillfully killed one of the latter, who fortunately fell on board.","During the following days, the Forward made very good progress; the wind veered to the south, and the sea ran high.

The following days, the Forward continued making good north-westerly progress; the wind became southerly, and the sea took on a large swell. The brig was now using full sail.

"Les êtres animés des régions hyperboréennes sentirent pourtant venir le soir, comme si l’astre radieux se fût dérobé derrière l’horizon. Les oiseaux, les poissons, les cétacés disparurent. Où ? Au plus profond du ciel ? Au plus profond de la mer ? Qui l’eût pu dire ? Mais, à leurs cris, à leurs sifflements, au frémissement des vagues agitées par la respiration des monstres marins, succéda bientôt la silencieuse immobilité ; les flots s’endormirent dans une insensible ondulation, et la nuit reprit sa paisible influence sous les regards étincelants du soleil.","The animated beings of the hyperborean regions, however, felt the approach of evening, as if the radiant star had slipped away behind the horizon. Birds, fish, cetaceans disappeared. Where ? Deep in the sky? Deep in the sea? Who could have said that?

Whither? To the depths of the ocean? Who could say? But soon total silence succeeded to their cries, and the sound of their passage through the water; the sea grew calmer and calmer, and night retained its gentle peace even beneath the glowing sun.","The living creatures of the hyperboreal regions nevertheless felt evening coming, as if the radiant body had hidden below the horizon. The birds, the fish, and the cetaceans disappeared. Where to? The top of the sky? The bottom of the sea? No one could say. But after the cries, the whistling, and the waves rippling from the breathing of the sea-monsters, there came silent immobility; the deep went to sleep in an imperceptible undulation, and night exerted its peaceful influence once more under the sparkling regard of the sun."

"– Certes, et par deux raisons : la première, c’est que nous sommes plus rapprochés du centre du globe, qui, par conséquent, nous attire davantage : or, cette force attractive n’est autre chose que la pesanteur.

"Cependant, dans les circonstances actuelles, personne ne manifesta la joie qu’une semblable découverte devait produire ; chacun se renfermait en lui-même et se demandait ce que pouvait être cette terre du pôle.

Était-elle donc si inhospitalière qu’une mouette ou un ptarmigan n’y pussent trouver asile ? Les poissons eux-mêmes, les grands cétacés, fuyaient rapidement cette côte à travers les eaux transparentes.

"Après d’assez beaux voyages dans les mers du sud, Hatteras essaya pour la première fois en 1846 de s’élever au nord par la mer de Baffin ; mais il ne put dépasser le soixante-quatorzième degré de latitude ; il montait le sloop l’Halifax ; son équipage eut à souffrir des tourments atroces, et John Hatteras poussa si loin son aventureuse audace, que désormais les marins furent peu tentés de recommencer de semblables expéditions sous un pareil chef.","After rather fine voyages in the South Seas, Hatteras attempted for the first time in 1846 to ascend north by Baffin's Bay; but he could not exceed the seventy-fourth degree of latitude; he rode the sloop Halifax; his crew had to suffer atrocious torments, and John Hatteras pushed his adventurous audacity so far, that henceforth the sailors were little tempted to recommence similar expeditions under such a leader.","After many successful voyages in the southern seas, Hatteras tried for the first time in 1846 to reach the North through Baffin's Bay, but he could get no farther than latitude 74°; he sailed in the sloop Halifax; his crew suffered terribly, and John Hatteras carried his temerity so far that henceforth sailors were averse to undertaking a similar expedition under such a leader.","After wonderful voyages to the Southern Seas, Hatteras tried to reach the north via Baffin Bay for the first time in 1846; but he could not get further than the seventy-fourth parallel; he was on the sloop the Halifax; * his crew underwent atrocious suffering, and John Hatteras pushed his rash adventure so far, that thereafter sailors were not tempted by other expeditions under such a leader."

The doctor, wanting to keep his head for his collection of natural history, and his skin for future needs, had both prepared quickly and inexpensively. He plunged the body of the animal into the fire pit, and thousands of small shrimps removed the smallest bits of flesh; at the end of half a day the work was accomplished, and the most skilful of the honorable corporation of tanners of Liverpool could not have succeeded better.","Still, on the 19th, Simpson succeeded in getting one four hundred yards distant from the ship; he had taken the precaution to close its hole in the ice, so that it could not escape from its pursuers.

The doctor wanted to preserve its head for his natural history collection and its skin for future use; he prepared both using a quick and cheap method. He dropped the body into the fire hole, whereupon thousands of small shrimps removed every fragment of flesh; half a day later the work was finished, and the most skilful member of the Honourable Guild of Tanners of Liverpool could not have done better."

However, it was necessary to watch carefully for the slightest accidents on the road and to find them as far as possible; it was therefore necessary to brave the dangers of ophthalmia; however, the doctor and Bell, covering their eyes, left it to each of them in turn to steer the sled.","Simpson's condition grew worse; the doctor could not be mistaken about the symptoms of a speedy death.

Let’s continue; McClure went to visit Captain Kellett on Melville Island; in twelve days he covered the 170 miles from Mercy Bay to Winter Harbour; he agreed with the commander of the Herald to transfer his sick to him, and came back on board; you might have thought that in McClure’s situation he had done enough, but the intrepid young man wanted to tempt fate again. Then––and it is here that I request your attention––his Lieutenant Cresswell, accompanying the sick and wounded of the Investigator, left Mercy Bay, reached Winter Harbour, and, after a journey of 470 miles across the ice, arrived at Beechey Island on 2 June; a few days later, with twelve of his men, he went on board the Phoenix.’ *"

"Le désordre arriva à son comble parmi ces hommes qui rompaient tout frein.

"Pendant les trois jours suivants, les 24, 25 et 26 avril, ce fut une lutte continuelle avec les glaces ; la manœuvre de la machine devint très fatigante ; à chaque minute, la vapeur était subitement interrompue ou renversée, et s’échappait en sifflant par les soupapes.","During the next three days, the 24th, 25th, and 26th of April, there was a continual struggle with the ice; the operation of the machine became very tiring; every minute the steam was suddenly interrupted or reversed, and escaped whistling through the valves.","During the three following days, the 24th, 25th, and 26th of April, they had uninterruptedly to fight with the ice; the management of the engines became very tedious; every minute steam was shut off or reversed, and escaped from the safety-valve.","The following three days, 24, 25, and 26 April, were a continual struggle with the ice; managing the boiler became very tiring; each minute the steam had to be suddenly closed down or reversed, and would escape whistling through the valves."
"On fit un trou à feu à une distance assez rapprochée du brick ; c’était un espace circulaire creusé dans le champ, un véritable puits, qui devait être maintenu toujours praticable ; chaque matin, on brisait la glace formée à l’orifice ; il devait servir à se procurer de l’eau en cas d’incendie, ou pour les bains fréquents ordonnés aux hommes de l’équipage par mesure d’hygiène ; on avait même soin, afin d’épargner le combustible, de puiser l’eau dans des couches profondes, où elle est moins froide ; on parvenait à ce résultat au moyen d’un appareil indiqué par un savant français[49] ; cet appareil, descendu à une certaine profondeur, donnait accès à l’eau environnante au moyen d’un double fond mobile dans un cylindre.","A fire-hole was made at a fairly close distance from the brig; it was a circular space dug in the field, a veritable well, which had to be kept always practicable; every morning the ice formed at the orifice was broken; it was to be used to obtain water in case of fire, or for the frequent baths ordered to the men of the crew as a measure of hygiene; care was even taken, in order to save fuel, to draw water from deep layers, where it is less cold; this result was achieved by means of an apparatus indicated by a French scientist[49]; this device, lowered to a certain depth, gave access to the surrounding water by means of a mobile double bottom in a cylinder.","A trench was dug tolerably near the brig; this was a circular space in the ice, a real pit, which had to be kept always open.

"– C’était féerique, mon ami ! La maison construite par ordre de l’impératrice Anne, et dans laquelle elle fit faire les noces de l’un de ses bouffons, en 1740, avait à peu près la grandeur de la nôtre ; mais, au-devant de sa façade, six canons de glace s’allongeaient sur leurs affûts ; on tira plusieurs fois à boulet et à poudre, et ces canons n’éclatèrent pas ; il y avait également des mortiers taillés pour des bombes de soixante livres ; ainsi nous pourrions établir au besoin une artillerie formidable : le bronze n’est pas loin, et il nous tombe du ciel. Mais où le goût et l’art triomphèrent, ce fut au fronton du palais, orné de statues de glace d’une grande beauté ; le perron offrait aux regards des vases de fleurs et d’orangers faits de la même matière ; à droite se dressait un éléphant énorme qui lançait de l’eau pendant le jour et du naphte enflammé pendant la nuit. Hein ! quelle ménagerie complète nous ferions, si nous le voulions bien !","- It was magical, my friend! The house built by order of the Empress Anne, and in which she arranged for the wedding of one of her jesters, in 1740, was about the size of ours; but, in front of its facade, six cannons of ice stretched out on their carriages; shots and powder were fired several times, and these guns did not burst; there were also mortars sized for sixty-pound bombs; thus we could establish a formidable artillery if necessary: the bronze is not far, and it falls to us from the sky. But where taste and art triumphed, it was on the pediment of the palace, adorned with ice statues of great beauty; the steps presented vases of flowers and orange trees made of the same material; to the right stood a huge elephant, spouting water by day and flaming naphtha by night.

"En somme, le sentiment général du bord, c’était la tristesse. Rien d’écœurant en effet comme la vue de ce navire captif, qui ne repose plus dans son élément naturel, dont les formes sont altérées sous ces épaisses couches de glace ; il ne ressemble à rien : fait pour le mouvement, il ne peut bouger ; on le métamorphose en maison de bois, en magasin, en demeure sédentaire, lui qui sait braver le vent et les orages !

Ce fut alors que le docteur mit une question intéressante sur le tapis.,It was then that the doctor brought up an interesting question.,It was then that the doctor brought forward an interesting subject.,It was then that the doctor raised an interesting question.
"La journée se passa dans un profond abattement. La folie du capitaine était d’un présage funeste, et, quand Johnson, Bell, Altamont reportaient leurs idées vers le retour, ils s’effrayaient de leur abandon, ils s’épouvantaient de leur éloignement. L’âme intrépide d’Hatteras leur faisait défaut.","The day passed in deep depression. The captain's madness was a disastrous omen, and when Johnson, Bell, Altamont postponed their ideas towards the return, they were frightened at their abandonment, they were terrified at their remoteness. They lacked the fearless soul of Hatteras.","The day passed in great gloom.

The captain’s madness was a terrible blow, and when Johnson, Bell, and Altamont thought about their return, they were frightened by their abandonment, they were terrified of the distance. They missed Hatteras’s intrepid soul."
Ces mots furent suivis d’un assez long silence. Le docteur n’osait interpréter le sens de ces dernières paroles.,These words were followed by a fairly long silence. The doctor dared not interpret the meaning of these last words.,A long silence followed these words. The doctor did not dare to try to interpret the last remark.,"said the captain, followed by a long silence. The doctor did not dare interpret the meaning of these last words."
"Mais si le docteur vit ce qui se passait dans l’âme de l’Américain, Hatteras le comprit, lui qui se fût laissé tuer plutôt que d’implorer l’intervention de son rival. Toutefois, il eut à peine le temps de s’en rendre compte, car Altamont apparut près de lui.","But if the doctor saw what was passing in the soul of the American, Hatteras understood it, he who would have let himself be killed rather than implore the intervention of his rival. However, he barely had time to realize it, because Altamont appeared near him.","But if the doctor saw what was taking place in the American's heart, Hatteras understood it, who would rather have died than have implored his rival's interference. Still, he had hardly time to perceive it, for Altamont appeared before him.","The doctor perhaps saw what was happening in the American’s soul; but Hatteras understood it all too well, although he would have preferred to die rather than beg his rival to intervene.

"– Oh ! fit ce dernier, un peu confus, monsieur Clawbonny !","- Oh ! said the latter, a little confused, Mr. Clawbonny!","""O,"" said the latter, a little embarrassed, ""O doctor!""","‘Oh,’ he said, a little embarrassed, ‘Dr Clawbonny!’"
Une sorte de fumée s’élevait sensiblement au-dessus de la mer.,A kind of smoke rose noticeably above the sea.,A sort of smoke was clearly rising above the sea.,The indefinable smoke rose perceptibly above the sea.

"Le Porpoise était entièrement enseveli sous la neige ; il n’avait plus ni mât, ni vergue, ni cordage ; tout son gréement fut brisé à l’époque du naufrage.

"– C’est dur ! dit le vieux Johnson d’un air très mortifié. Que des hommes vous traitent ainsi, passe encore, mais des ours !","- It's hard ! said old Johnson, looking very mortified. That men treat you like this, still passes, but bears!","""This is hard,"" said Johnson, with a very mortified air. ""It's well enough to have men treat you in this way, but bears!""","‘It’s not easy!’ said old Johnson with a hurt air. ‘ Men doing this to you is one thing, but bears!’"
"– Mes amis, fit le docteur, en intervenant de son mieux, voyons, un peu de calme, tout peut s’arranger. Écoutez-moi.","“My friends,” said the doctor, intervening as best he could, “come on, a little calm, everything can be arranged. Listen to me.","""My friends,"" said the doctor, intervening for the best, ""come, a little calm, it can all settle itself. Listen to me!""","‘My friends,’ said the doctor, intervening as best he could, ‘calm down, everything can be settled; listen to me.’"
"La précaution de décharger le Porpoise avait été opportune. Le navire subissait une pression lente, insensible, mais irrésistible, qui l’écrasait peu à peu ; il était évident qu’on ne pourrait rien faire de ces débris. Cependant le docteur espérait toujours en tirer une chaloupe quelconque pour revenir en Angleterre ; mais le moment n’était pas encore venu de procéder à sa construction.","The precaution of unloading the Porpoise had been timely. The ship felt a slow, imperceptible, but irresistible pressure, which gradually crushed it; it was obvious that nothing could be done with this debris.

"Hatteras, la boussole à la main, reprit la route du nord ; peu à peu le brouillard perdit de sa lumière, puis de sa transparence ; le vent fit entendre ses rugissements à quelques toises, et bientôt la chaloupe, se couchant sous une violente rafale, rentra dans la zone des tempêtes.","Hatteras, compass in hand, resumed the northern route; little by little the fog lost its light, then its transparency; the wind made its roar heard a few fathoms away, and soon the launch, lying under a violent gust, returned to the storm zone.","Hatteras, compass in hand, turned the boat's head to the north; gradually the mist lost its brightness and transparency; the wind could be heard roaring a short distance off; and soon the launch, lying over before a strong gust, re-entered the zone of storms.","Compass in hand, Hatteras turned north again; little by little, the fog lost its luminosity, then its transparency; the wind produced howlings a few fathoms away, and soon the launch, flattened by a violent gust, returned to the domain of the storm."
"– À quoi bon le savoir ? répondit le docteur ; le fait est certain, il n’y faut plus penser.","""What's the use of knowing that?"" answered the doctor; the fact is certain, we must think no more of it.","""Why should we know?"" said the doctor; ""the fact is certain, we need give it no more thought.""","‘What is the point of knowing?’ said the doctor. ‘It’s happened, and we shouldn’t think about it any more.’"

"– Cela prouve, mes garçons, riposta le maître avec une dédaigneuse satisfaction, que vous ne savez ni voir ni réfléchir ; cela prouve qu’on a voulu donner du jeu à la tête de ce gouvernail afin qu’il pût être facilement placé ou déplacé.

However, do you not know that in the middle of the ice, this is a maneuver that often happens again?","""That proves, my men,"" replied the quartermaster with a scornful smile, ""that you can neither see nor think; it proves that they wanted to leave the head of the rudder free, so that it might be unshipped and shipped again easily. Don't you know that's what they have to do very often in the ice?""","‘It means, my boys,’ retorted the bosun with contemptuous glee, ‘that you lot don’t use your eyes or heads; it means that the rudder head needed more play, so it could be set or moved easily.

"– Oui, capitaine, c’est bien l’île Beechey ! Seulement, il nous faudra laisser porter un peu au nord ; la côte y est plus accostable.","""Yes, captain, it is Beechey Island!""

"Aussitôt, les bœufs s’arrêtèrent, et, moins effrayés de la vue d’un seul ennemi, ils revinrent sur Hatteras ; celui-ci les attendit de pied ferme, coucha en joue le plus rapproché des deux quadrupèdes, fit feu, sans que sa balle, frappant l’animal en plein front, parvînt à enrayer sa marche. Le second coup de fusil d’Hatteras ne produisit d’autre effet que de rendre ces bêtes furieuses ; elles se jetèrent sur le chasseur désarmé et le renversèrent en un instant.","Immediately the oxen stopped, and, less frightened by the sight of a single enemy, they returned to Hatteras; the latter awaited them resolutely, took aim at the nearest of the two quadrupeds, fired, without his bullet, striking the animal full in the forehead, succeeding in stopping its progress. Hatteras' second shot produced no other effect than to infuriate these beasts; they threw themselves on the unarmed hunter and knocked him down in an instant.","At once the oxen stopped, and, less fearful of a single enemy, they turned upon Hatteras. He awaited them calmly, aimed at the nearest, and fired; but the bullet struck the animal in the middle of his forehead, without penetrating the skull. Hatteras's second shot produced no other effect than to make the beasts furious; they ran to the disarmed hunter, and threw him down at once.","The oxen immediately stopped and, less frightened by the sight of a single enemy, went back towards Hatteras; the captain waited for them without flinching; he aimed at the closer one and fired, but, although the bullet hit it in the middle of the forehead, it did not slow down.

"– Oh ! j’avais tout vu, répondit le docteur ; vos coups de fusil m’ont donné l’éveil ; je me trouvais en ce moment près des débris du Porpoise ; j’ai gravi un hummock ; j’ai aperçu les cinq ours qui vous poursuivaient de près ; ah ! quelle peur j’ai ressentie pour vous ! Mais enfin votre dégringolade du haut de la colline et l’hésitation des animaux m’ont rassuré momentanément ; j’ai compris que vous aviez eu le temps de vous barricader dans la maison. Alors, peu à peu, je me suis approché, tantôt rampant, tantôt me glissant entre les glaçons ; je suis arrivé près du fort, et j’ai vu ces énormes bêtes au travail, comme de gros castors ; ils battaient la neige, ils amoncelaient les blocs, en un mot ils vous muraient tout vivants. Il est heureux que l’idée ne leur soit pas venue de précipiter des blocs de glace du sommet du cône, car vous auriez été écrasés sans merci.","- Oh ! I had seen everything, answered the doctor; your rifle shots have awakened me; I was at this moment near the debris of the Porpoise; I climbed a hummock; I saw the five bears pursuing you closely; ah! what fear I felt for you! But finally your tumble from the top of the hill and the hesitation of the animals reassured me momentarily; I understood that you had had time to barricade yourself in the house. So, little by little, I approached, sometimes crawling, sometimes slipping between the ice cubes; I came near the fort, and saw these huge beasts at work, like big beavers; they beat the snow, they piled up the blocks, in a word, they walled you up alive. It is fortunate that the idea did not occur to them to rush blocks of ice from the top of the cone, because you would have been crushed mercilessly.","""O, I saw everything!"" answered the doctor; ""your shots warned me; I happened to be near the fragments of the Porpoise; I climbed up a hummock; I saw five bears chasing you; ah, I feared the worst for you! But the way you slid down the hill, and the hesitation of the animals, reassured me for a time; I knew you'd had time to lock yourselves in. Then I approached gradually, climbing and creeping between cakes of ice; I arrived near the fort, and I saw the huge beasts working like beavers; they were tossing the snow about, heaping up the ice so as to bury you alive. Fortunately, they did not think of hurling the blocks down from the top of the cone, for you would have been crushed without mercy.""","‘Oh, I saw everything; your gunshots alerted me; at that moment I was near the remains of the Porpoise; I climbed a hummock, and saw the five bears in hot pursuit; ah, how afraid I was for you then! But in the end, your tumble down the hill and the animals’ hesitation reassured me for the moment; I realized that you’d had time to barricade yourselves in the house. Then gradually I approached, sometimes crawling, sometimes slipping between the ice; I got near the fort, and I saw the enormous animals working like huge beavers; they were hitting the snow, and piling up blocks; in sum they were burying you alive. It’s lucky they didn’t have the idea of sending blocks of ice down from the top of the cone, for you would have been totally crushed.’"

"Et, cependant, à leurs vêtements huileux de peaux de phoques, à leurs bottes de même nature, à tout cet ensemble graisseux et infect qui ne permet pas de distinguer les hommes des femmes, il était facile de reconnaître de quelle nourriture ces gens-là faisaient usage ; d’ailleurs, comme chez tous les peuples ichthyophages, la lèpre les rongeait en partie, mais ils ne s’en portaient pas plus mal pour cela.","And yet, by their oily sealskin clothes, their boots of the same nature, by all that greasy and revolting outfit which makes it impossible to distinguish the men from the women, it was easy to recognize what food these people used to eat. used; besides, as with all fish-eating peoples, leprosy ate them in part, but they weren't the worse for it.","And yet, from the oily sealskin clothes and boots, from their squat, fat figures, which make it hard to distinguish the men from the women, it was easy to declare the nature of their food; besides, like all fish-eating people, they were somewhat troubled by leprosy, but their general health was not impaired by it.","And yet from their oily sealskin clothes, their boots of the same material, from all this greasy and repugnant clothing that does not allow men and women to be told apart, it was easy to see what food these people ate.

"Le vent retomba dans le sud vers le soir. Hatteras fit alors établir sa voilure et éteindre ses feux ; pendant plusieurs jours, les plus pénibles manœuvres furent reprises par l’équipage ; à chaque instant, il fallait ou lofer ou laisser arriver, ou masquer brusquement les voiles pour enrayer la marche du brick ; les bras des vergues déjà roidis par le froid couraient mal dans les poulies engorgées, et ajoutaient encore à la fatigue ; il fallut plus d’une semaine pour atteindre la pointe Barrow.

Hatteras then had his sails set up and his fires extinguished; for several days the most arduous maneuvers were taken over by the crew; at every moment it was necessary either to luff or to let the sails come in, or to abruptly hide the sails in order to check the progress of the brig; the arms of the yards, already stiffened by the cold, ran badly in the clogged pulleys, and added still more to the fatigue; it took over a week to reach Point Barrow. The Forward had not gained thirty miles in ten days.","Towards evening the wind shifted to the south. Hatteras then set his sails and had the fires put out; for many days the crew were kept hard at work; every few minutes they had to tack or bear away, or to shorten sail quickly to stop the course of the brig; the braces could not run easily through the choked-up pulleys, and added to the fatigue of the crew; more than a week was required for them to reach Point Barrow. The Forward had not made thirty miles in ten days.","The wind veered south again in the evening. Hatteras had the sails unfurled and the boiler put out; for a few days, the crew executed the most difficult manoeuvres; at each moment, they had to luff, fall off, or back the sails to slow down the brig; the braces of the yards, already stiffened by the cold, ran poorly through the distorted pulleys and added further to the fatigue; it took more than a week to reach Barrow Point.

"– Et maintenant, reprit le docteur, examinons la question à son point de vue moral. Je conçois qu’un Anglais sacrifie sa fortune et son existence pour donner à l’Angleterre une gloire de plus ! Mais parce qu’un canot fait de quelques planches arrachées à un navire américain, à un bâtiment naufragé et sans valeur, aura touché la côte nouvelle ou parcouru l’océan inconnu, cela pourra-t-il réduire l’honneur de la découverte ? Est-ce que si vous aviez rencontré vous-même, sur cette plage, la coque d’un navire abandonné, vous auriez hésité à vous en servir ? N’est-ce pas au chef seul de l’expédition qu’appartient le bénéfice de la réussite ? Et je vous demande si cette chaloupe, construite par quatre Anglais, ne sera pas anglaise depuis la quille jusqu’au plat-bord ?","“And now,” resumed the doctor, “let us examine the question from its moral point of view. I understand that an Englishman sacrifices his fortune and his existence to give England one more glory! But because a canoe made of a few planks torn from an American ship, from a shipwrecked and worthless vessel, will have touched the new coast or sailed the unknown ocean, can that reduce the honor of the discovery? If you had come across the hull of an abandoned ship on this beach yourself, would you have hesitated to use it? Doesn't the benefit of success belong to the leader of the expedition alone? And I ask you if this shallop, built by four Englishmen, will not be English from the keel to the gunwale?","""And now,"" continued the doctor, ""let us look at the question from a moral point of view. I can understand that an Englishman should give up his life and his fortune for the honor of his country. But because a boat made of a few planks torn from a wrecked American ship first touches the coast or crosses the unknown ocean, can that diminish the honor of the discovery? If you found on this shore the hull of an abandoned ship, should you hesitate to make use of it? Doesn't the glory of success belong to the head of the expedition? And I ask you if this launch built by four Englishmen, manned by four Englishmen, would not be English from keel to gunwale?""","‘And now,’ continued the doctor, ‘let’s examine the question from the moral point of view. I understand that a Briton can sacrifice his fortune and life to give Britain one more reason for glory.

"Hatteras remonta sur la dunette. Une brume intense enveloppait le Forward ; du pont on apercevait à peine le haut de sa mâture.

"Cette ravine avait été naguère le théâtre d’une dernière lutte des hommes contre le climat, contre le désespoir, contre la faim même, car, à certains restes horribles, on comprit que les malheureux s’étaient repus de cadavres humains, peut-être d’une chair encore palpitante, et, parmi eux, le docteur avait reconnu Shandon, Pen, le misérable équipage du Forward ; les forces firent défaut, les vivres manquèrent à ces infortunés ; leur chaloupe fut brisée probablement par les avalanches ou précipitée dans un gouffre, et ils ne purent profiter de la mer libre ; on peut supposer aussi qu’ils s’égarèrent au milieu de ces continents inconnus. D’ailleurs, des gens partis sous l’excitation de la révolte ne pouvaient être longtemps unis entre eux de cette union qui permet d’accomplir les grandes choses.

Moreover, people who left under the excitement of revolt could not be united for long with that union which makes it possible to accomplish great things.

Besides, men who had left in mutiny could not long be united with the closeness which is necessary for the accomplishment of great things. A ringleader of a revolt has never more than a doubtful authority in his hands. And, without doubt, Shandon was promptly deposed.","Not long previously, this valley had been the scene of a last battle against time, against despair, against hunger; and from certain horrible remains, it could be understood that the wretches had fed on human bodies, perhaps living bodies; and amongst them, the doctor recognized Shandon, Pen, and the whole miserable crew of the Forward; strength had been lacking in these unfortunate men, as well as food; their launch had probably been buried in an avalanche or fallen into a chasm, and they had been unable to profit from the open sea; they had presumably also got lost in these unknown lands. In any case, people caught up in the excitement of mutiny could not maintain for long that union which allows great things to be accomplished. A ringleader of mutineers never has anything but an uncertain power in his hands. And without doubt, Shandon had soon lost control."
"– Cependant, reprit Wall, nous voici dans une mer plus libre ; nous revenons vers des routes déjà reconnues ; n’exagérez-vous pas, Shandon ?","“However,” resumed Wall, “here we are in a freer sea; we return to routes already recognized; are you not exaggerating, Shandon?","""Still,"" resumed Wall, ""we are in a more open sea; we are going along a well-known route; don't you exaggerate somewhat, Shandon?""","‘But here we are in a freer sea; we’re returning to routes that have already been reconnoitred; aren’t you exaggerating a little, Shandon?’"

"– Eh bien, écoutez ceci, Shandon ; il résulte très évidemment des faits géographiques et de l’étude des lignes isothermes que le point le plus froid du globe n’est pas au pôle même ; semblable au point magnétique de la terre, il s’écarte du pôle de plusieurs degrés. Ainsi les calculs de Brewster, de Bergham et de quelques physiciens démontrent qu’il y a dans notre hémisphère deux pôles de froid : l’un serait situé en Asie par soixante-dix-neuf degrés trente minutes de latitude nord, et par cent vingt degrés de longitude est ; l’autre se trouverait en Amérique par soixante dix-huit degrés de latitude nord et par quatre-vingt dix-sept degrés de longitude ouest. Ce dernier est celui qui nous occupe, et vous voyez, Shandon, qu’il se rencontre à plus de douze degrés au-dessous du pôle.

Thus the calculations of Brewster, Bergham and a few physicists demonstrate that there are two poles of cold in our hemisphere: one would be located in Asia at seventy-nine degrees thirty minutes north latitude, and at one hundred and twenty degrees of longitude east; the other would be in America at seventy-eight degrees north latitude and ninety-seven degrees west longitude. The latter is the one with which we are concerned, and you see, Shandon, that it occurs more than twelve degrees below the pole. Well, I ask you, why shouldn't the sea be as clear of ice at this point as it can be in summer by the sixty-sixth parallel, that is to say south of the Baffin Bay?","""Well, listen to this, Shandon; it results very clearly from geographical facts, and from the study of isothermal lines, that the coldest spot on the globe is not on the Pole itself; like the magnetic pole, it lies a few degrees distant.

This last alone concerns us, and you see, Shandon, that it is more than twelve degrees below the Pole.

"Mais alors la masse des glaces, immobile jusqu’alors, se divisa et se mit en mouvement ; les ice-bergs semblaient surgir de tous les points de l’horizon ; le brick se trouvait engagé dans une série d’écueils mouvants dont la force d’écrasement est irrésistible ; la manœuvre devint assez difficile pour que Garry, le meilleur timonier, prît la barre ; les montagnes tendaient à se refermer derrière le brick ; il fut donc nécessaire de traverser cette flotte de glaces, et la prudence autant que le devoir commandait de se porter en avant. Les difficultés s’accroissaient de l’impossibilité où se trouvait Shandon de constater la direction du navire au milieu de ces points changeants, qui se déplaçaient et n’offraient aucune perspective stable.","But then the mass of ice, motionless until then, divided and began to move; icebergs seemed to surge from all points of the horizon; the brig was engaged in a series of moving reefs whose crushing force is irresistible; the maneuver became difficult enough for Garry, the best helmsman, to take the helm; the mountains tended to close in behind the brig; it was therefore necessary to cross this fleet of ice, and prudence as well as duty demanded to go forward. The difficulties were compounded by Shandon's inability to see the direction of the ship amidst these shifting points, which shifted and offered no stable perspective.","But then the mass of ice, which had hitherto been stationary, separated, and began to move; icebergs seemed to rise in all points of the horizon; the brig was caught in a number of whirlpools of irresistible force; controlling her became so hard, that Garry, the best steersman, took the helm; the masses began to close behind the brig, hence it was necessary to cut through the ice; both prudence and duty commanded them to go forward. The difficulties were enhanced by the impossibility of Shandon's fixing the direction of the brig among all the changing points, which were continually shifting and presenting no definite point to be aimed at.","But then the mass of ice, stationary until now, began to break up and move; the icebergs seemed to spring up from every point of the horizon; the brig was soon caught up in a succession of moving shoals of irresistible destructive power; the operations became so difficult that Garry, the best helmsman, took the wheel; the mountains were starting to close up again behind the brig. It was essential to get through this icy fleet, and safety as much as duty dictated moving ahead. The difficulties were increased because Shandon found it impossible to know the ship’s direction amongst these points, all moving and offering no stable perspective."

Les voyageurs comptaient profiter pour leur excursion de ces quelques semaines de beau temps que la nature accorde aux contrées hyperboréennes. Les souffrances seraient donc moins cruelles à affronter, les obstacles plus faciles à vaincre.","Finally, a change of great importance for winterers was brewing in the state of the polar basin. The ice was beginning to shake in the middle of the bay; the highest, incessantly undermined by shocks, only required a storm strong enough to tear itself from the shore and form mobile icebergs. However Hatteras did not want to wait for the dislocation of the ice field to begin his excursion. Since the journey had to be made by land, it mattered little to him whether the sea was open or not; he therefore fixed the departure for the 25th of June; by then, all preparations could be fully completed. Johnson and Bell busied themselves in restoring the sled to perfect condition; the frames were reinforced and the skids refurbished. The travelers counted on profiting for their excursion from these few weeks of fine weather which nature grants to the Hyperborean countries. The suffering would therefore be less cruel to face, the obstacles easier to overcome.","Then, too, a change of great importance was taking place in the state of the polar basin. The ice in the middle of the bay was beginning to give way; the tallest pieces, forever weakened by the collision of the rest, only needed a sufficiently heavy tempest to be torn away and to become icebergs. Still, Hatteras was unwilling to wait so long before starting. Since it was to be a land journey, he cared very little whether the sea was open or not. He determined to start June 25th; meanwhile all the preparations could be completed. Johnson and Bell put the sledge into perfect repair; the frame was strengthened and the runners renewed. The travellers intended to devote to their journey the few weeks of good weather which nature allows to these northern regions. Their sufferings would be less severe, the obstacles easier to overcome.","Finally, a change of momentous importance came to the polar basin. The ice was beginning to move in the middle of the bay; the tallest parts, constantly undermined by collisions, merely required a strong enough storm to tear themselves from the shore and form icebergs. However, Hatteras did not want to wait for the break-up of the ice-field to begin his journey. Since it was to be over land, he did not care whether the sea was free; so he fixed the departure for 25 June; before then, all preparations had to be finished. Johnson and Bell busied themselves making sure the sledge was in perfect condition; the chassis was reinforced and the runners replaced. The travellers planned to profit from the few weeks of fine weather nature grants to the hyperboreal regions. Enduring the suffering would be less cruel, overcoming the obstacles, easier. *"

"Enfin, vers six heures du soir, une vapeur de forme indécise, mais sensiblement élevée, apparut au-dessus du niveau de la mer ; on eût dit un panache de fumée ; le ciel était parfaitement pur : donc cette vapeur ne pouvait s’expliquer par un nuage ; elle disparaissait par instants, et reparaissait, comme agitée.","Finally, about six o'clock in the evening, a mist of indecisive form, but noticeably high, appeared above the level of the sea; it looked like a plume of smoke; the sky was perfectly clear: therefore this vapor could not be explained by a cloud; it disappeared at times, and reappeared, as if agitated.","At length, at about six o'clock in the evening, a shapeless vapor appeared at a little height above the level of the sea; it looked like a puff of smoke; the sky was perfectly cold, so this vapor was no cloud; it would keep appearing and disappearing, as if it were in commotion.","Finally, at about six in the evening, a mist of indistinct form appeared, slightly above sea-level; it looked like smoke; the sky was perfectly clear; so this water vapour could not be explained as a cloud; it disappeared at times, and then reappeared, as if not stationary."

"Chacun eut donc l’idée de décharger ses armes, afin de se donner un signal de ralliement. Mais, si le son de la voix paraissait trop faible, les détonations des armes à feu étaient trop fortes, car les échos s’en emparèrent, et, répercutées dans toutes les directions, elles produisaient un roulement confus, sans direction appréciable.","Everyone therefore had the idea of unloading their weapons, in order to give themselves a rallying signal.

"Les oiseaux étaient encore fort nombreux, et leurs cris assourdissants ; des phoques, paresseusement couchés sur les glaçons en dérive, levaient leur tête peu effrayée et agitaient leurs longs cous au passage du navire ; celui-ci, en rasant leur demeure flottante, y laissa plus d’une fois des feuilles de son doublage roulées par le frottement.","The birds were still very numerous, and their cries deafening; seals, lying lazily on the drifting ice, raised their unfrightened heads and wiggled their long necks as the ship passed; the latter, in leveling their floating abode, more than once left there sheets of his dubbing rolled up by friction.","The birds were still very numerous, and their cries were deafening; the seals, lying lazily on the drifting ice, raised their heads without being frightened, and turned their long necks to watch the ship go by. Often, too, the brig would leave bits of sheathing on the ice against which she grazed.","Birds were still very numerous, their cries deafening; seals, lazily stretched out on drifting ice floes, raised their unfrightened heads and twisted their long necks as the ship passed; as she cut past their floating dwellings, she occasionally left torn-off sheets of her cladding."

"Il prit le poker[68] qui servait à Johnson à dégager ses fourneaux et le plongea dans le brasier du poêle ; puis il pratiqua une ouverture dans la muraille de neige, mais sans la prolonger jusqu’au-dehors, et de manière à conserver extérieurement une légère couche de glace.","He took the poker[68] which Johnson used to clear his stoves and plunged it into the brazier of the stove; then he made an opening in the wall of snow, but without extending it to the outside, and in such a way as to preserve a light layer of ice on the outside.","He took the poker and plunged it into the stove; then he made an opening in the wall, but so as to keep a thin coating of ice outside.","He picked up the poker Johnson used for the oven, and placed it in the burning stove; then he made an opening in the snow wall, but without going all the way through, keeping a thin layer of ice outside."

"Le lendemain, on s’occupa de construire les magasins et la poudrière ; ce fut encore l’affaire d’une huitaine de jours, en y comprenant le temps employé au déchargement complet du Porpoise, qui ne se fit pas sans difficulté, car la température très basse ne permettait pas de travailler longtemps. Enfin, le 8 avril, les provisions, le combustible et les munitions se trouvaient en terre ferme et parfaitement à l’abri ; les magasins étaient situés au nord, et la poudrière au sud du plateau, à soixante pieds environ de chaque extrémité de la maison ; une sorte de chenil fut construit près des magasins ; il était destiné à loger l’attelage Groënlandais, et le docteur l’honora du nom de « Dog-Palace ». Duk, lui, partageait la demeure commune.","The next day they occupied themselves with building the magazines and the powder magazine; it was still a matter of a week, including the time taken to completely unload the Porpoise, which was not done without difficulty, because the very low temperature did not allow working for long. Finally, on April 8, the provisions, the fuel and the ammunition were on solid ground and perfectly sheltered; the stores were on the north, and the powder magazine on the south of the plateau, about sixty feet from each end of the house; a kind of kennel was built near the stores; it was intended to house the Greenland team, and the doctor honored it with the name of ""Dog-Palace"".

As for Duke, he lived in the snow-house."
"Pendant la journée du jeudi 1er juin, la baie qui porte le nom de baie Creswell, fut coupée diagonalement par le Forward ; depuis la pointe de la Fury, la côte s’élevait vers le nord en rochers perpendiculaires de trois cents pieds de hauteur ; au sud, elle tendait à s’abaisser ; quelques sommets neigeux présentaient aux regards des tables nettement coupées, tandis que les autres, affectant des formes bizarres, projetaient dans la brume leurs pyramides aiguës.","During the day of Thursday, June 1, the bay which bears the name of Creswell Bay, was cut diagonally by the Forward; from the point of Fury, the coast rose towards the north in perpendicular rocks three hundred feet in height; to the south it tended to fall; a few snowy peaks presented neatly cut tables to view, while others, assuming bizarre shapes, projected their pointed pyramids into the mist.","On Thursday, June 1st, the Forward sailed diagonally across Creswell Bay; from Point Fury the coast rises in steep rocks three hundred feet high; towards the south, it is lower; a few snowy summits are to be seen, of a regular shape, while others, more fantastic, were hidden in the clouds.","On Thursday, 1 June, Cresswell Bay was obliquely crossed by the Forward; from Fury Point the coast rose northwards in vertical cliffs, 300 feet high; in the south it tended to become lower; a few snowy summits displayed clean-cut tables, while others projected their strange sharp pyramids into the mist."
"Ils s’élancèrent en avant, et, après une heure et demie de marche, ils se trouvèrent en présence de deux animaux d’assez forte taille et d’un aspect véritablement redoutable ; ces singuliers quadrupèdes paraissaient étonnés des attaques de Duk, sans s’en effrayer d’ailleurs ; ils broutaient une sorte de mousse rose qui veloutait le sol dépourvu de neige. Le docteur les reconnut facilement à leur taille moyenne, à leurs cornes très élargies et soudées à la base, à cette curieuse absence de mufle, à leur chanfrein busqué comme celui du mouton et à leur queue très courte : l’ensemble de cette structure leur a fait donner, par les naturalistes, le nom d’« ovibos », mot composé qui rappelle les deux natures d’animaux dont ils tiennent. Une bourre de poils épaisse et longue, et une sorte de soie brune et fine formaient leur pelage.","They rushed forward, and after an hour and a half of walking, they found themselves in the presence of two animals of rather large size and of a truly formidable aspect; these singular quadrupeds seemed astonished at Duk's attacks, without being frightened by them; they grazed on a kind of pink moss that velvety the snowless ground. The doctor easily recognized them by their medium size, their very widened horns fused at the base, their curious absence of muzzle, their hooked muzzle like that of a sheep and their very short tail: the whole of this structure caused naturalists to give the name ""ovibos"", a compound word which recalls the two natures of animals from which they derive. A thick and long wad of hair, and a kind of brown and fine silk formed their coat.","They pushed on, and in an hour and a half they came up to two of these animals; they were large, and formidable in appearance. They appeared much surprised at Duke's attacks, but not alarmed; they were feeding off a sort of reddish moss which grew on the thin soil. The doctor recognized them at once from their moderate height, their horns, which were broad at the base, the absence of muzzle, their sheep-like forehead, and short tail; their shape has earned for them from naturalists the name of ""ovibos,"" a compound, and which expresses the two sorts of animals whose characteristics they share. Thick, long hair and a sort of delicate brown silk formed their fur.","They rushed forward, and after an hour and a half, found themselves in the presence of two animals, bigger than expected and of frightening appearance; these remarkable quadrupeds appeared astonished by Duke’s attacks, but did not seem fearful; they were grazing on a sort of pink moss which carpeted the snow-free ground. The doctor identified them easily from their modest height, broad horns joined at the base, curious lack of muzzle, Roman nose like that of sheep, and very short tail: all these features have led naturalists to call them ‘ovibos’, * a compound word from the two sorts of animals they look like. They had coarse long hair and a hide of fine brown silk."

"Cependant, le 6 avril, dès le matin, une foule considérable couvrait les quais de New Princes Docks ; l’innombrable corporation des marins de la ville semblait s’y être donné rendez-vous. Les ouvriers des warfs environnants avaient abandonné leurs travaux, les négociants leurs sombres comptoirs, les marchands leurs magasins déserts. Les omnibus multicolores, qui longent le mur extérieur des bassins, déversaient à chaque minute leur cargaison de curieux ; la ville ne paraissait plus avoir qu’une seule préoccupation : assister au départ du Forward.","However, on April 6, from the morning, a considerable crowd covered the quays of New Princes Docks; the innumerable corporation of sailors of the city seemed to have made an appointment there. The workers of the surrounding warfs had abandoned their labors, the traders their gloomy trading posts, the merchants their deserted stores. The multicolored omnibuses, which skirt the outer wall of the basins, poured out their cargo of sightseers every minute; the city seemed to have only one concern: to watch the departure of the Forward.","Nevertheless, from early morning on the 6th of April, a large crowd collected on the quays of the New Prince's Docks; all the sailors of the place seemed to have assembled there. The workingmen of the neighboring wharves had abandoned their tasks, tradesmen had left their gloomy shops, and the merchants their empty warehouses. The many-colored omnibuses which pass outside of the docks were discharging, every minute, their load of sight-seers; the whole city seemed to care for nothing except watching the departure of the Forward.","Nevertheless, a large crowd covered the quaysides of New Prince’s Docks from the early morning of 6 April, as if the city’s corporation of naval workers had arranged a meeting there. The dockers from the nearby wharves had abandoned their work, the tradesmen their dark counters, the merchants their deserted stores. Each minute a new cargo of sightseers poured out of the multicoloured omnibuses skirting the dock walls. The city appeared to have but one aim: to watch the Forward’s departure."
"Le voyage n’offrit aucune particularité pendant les premières heures de la matinée ; le pays, dans le nord-est, commençait à changer de physionomie ; quelques ressauts de terrain, premières ondulations d’une contrée montueuse, faisaient présager un sol nouveau.

This land of New America, if it did not form a continent, must have been at least an important island; besides, there was no question of verifying this geographical point.","During the early morning hours nothing noteworthy took place; the land grew different in the northeast; a few elevations, the beginning of a mountainous district, indicated a change. If this New America were not a continent, it was at any rate an important island; but then they did not have to trouble themselves about its geography.","The journey offered little in the early hours of the morning; the countryside to the north-east began to change; a few rises in the ground, the first undulations of hilly country, seemed to be the forerunners of a different kind of terrain.

"Il n’osa pas achever sa pensée ; Hatteras s’était précipité en avant, et un violent mouvement de désespoir s’empara de lui. Là avaient dû s’élever en effet ces magasins tant désirés, avec ces approvisionnements de toutes sortes sur lesquels il comptait ; mais la ruine, le pillage, le bouleversement, la destruction avaient passé là où des mains civilisées créèrent d’immenses ressources pour les navigateurs épuisés. Qui s’était livré à ces déprédations ? Les animaux de ces contrées, les loups, les renards, les ours ? Non, car ils n’eussent détruit que les vivres, et il ne restait pas un lambeau de tente, pas une pièce de bois, pas un morceau de fer, pas une parcelle d’un métal quelconque, et, circonstance plus terrible pour les gens du Forward, pas un fragment de combustible ! Évidemment les Esquimaux, qui ont été souvent en relation avec les navires européens, ont fini par apprendre la valeur de ces objets dont ils sont complètement dépourvus ; depuis le passage du Fox, ils étaient venus et revenus à ce lieu d’abondance, prenant et pillant sans cesse, avec l’intention bien raisonnée de ne laisser aucune trace de ce qui avait été ; et maintenant, un long rideau de neige à demi fondue recouvrait le sol !","He dared not finish his thought; Hatteras had rushed forward, and a violent movement of despair seized him. There must indeed have been erected those stores so much desired, with those supplies of all kinds on which he counted; but ruin, plunder, upheaval, destruction had passed where civilized hands created immense resources for exhausted navigators. Who had committed these depredations? The animals of these regions, wolves, foxes, bears? No, for they would have destroyed only the provisions, and not a shred of tent remained, not a piece of wood, not a piece of iron, not a scrap of any metal whatsoever, and, a more terrible circumstance for the people of the Forward, not a fragment of fuel! Obviously the Eskimos, who were often in contact with European ships, ended up learning the value of these objects of which they are completely deprived; since the passage of the Fox they had come and returned to this place of abundance, taking and plundering incessantly, with the well-reasoned intention of leaving no trace of what had been; and now a long curtain of half-melted snow covered the ground!","He durst not finish his sentence; Hatteras ran forward, and terrible despair seized him. There ought to stand those much-needed storehouses, with supplies of all sorts on which he had been counting; but ruin, pillage, and destruction had passed over that place where civilized hands had accumulated resources for battered sailors. Who had committed these depredations? Wild animals, wolves, foxes, bears? No, for they would have destroyed only the provisions; and there was left no shred of a tent, not a piece of wood, not a scrap of iron, no bit of any metal, nor—what was more serious for the men of the Forward—a single lump of coal. Evidently the Esquimaux, who have often had much to do with European ships, had finally learned the value of these objects; since the visit of the Fox they had come frequently to this great storehouse, and had pillaged incessantly, with the intention of leaving no trace of what had been there; and now a long drift of half-melted snow covered the ground.","He did not dare finish his idea; Hatteras rushed ahead, a strong feeling of despair taking hold of him. The desired storehouses should have been there, with the supplies of all sorts he was counting on; but ruin, pillage, upheaval, and destruction had intervened where civilized hands had provided immense resources for exhausted navigators. Who had done the damage? The animals of these regions–– wolves, foxes, bears? No, for they would only have destroyed the food; and not a shred of tent remained, not a plank of wood, not a sliver of iron, not a shard of any sort of metal, and, still worse in the present situation, not a scrap of fuel! Clearly the Eskimos’ contacts with European ships had eventually made them realize the value of such objects, which they are completely deprived of; since the Fox’s visit, they had often come to this place of plenty, taking and destroying each time, with the logical idea of not leaving any trace of what had been there; and now nothing but a broad blanket of snow covered the ground."
"À ces paroles désespérées, le docteur répondait par des soins incessants ; quoique brisé lui-même des fatigues du jour, il employait la nuit à composer quelque potion calmante pour le malade ; mais déjà le lime-juice restait sans action, et les frictions n’empêchaient pas le scorbut de s’étendre peu à peu.","To these desperate words the doctor replied with incessant care; although himself broken from the fatigues of the day, he employed the night in composing some calming potion for the patient; but already the lime-juice remained inactive, and the friction did not prevent the scurvy from spreading little by little.","The doctor answered these despairing words by incessant cares; although worn out by the fatigue of the day, he spent the night in composing a soothing potion for his patient; but the lime-juice was ineffectual, and continual friction could not keep down the progress of the scurvy.","To these despairing words, the doctor replied with unceasing care; although himself exhausted by the fatigues of the day, he spent the night preparing calming potions for the patient; but already the lime juice was having no effect, and rubbing did not prevent the scurvy from slowly spreading."

The sky was threatening; long clouds passed rapidly through the air; they passed near the ground, and so quickly that the eye could hardly follow them. At times some of the mist touched the ground, and the tent resisted with difficulty the violence of the hurricane. The hut was pitched in a ravine for shelter.","The wind had swung north, and become stronger; so they had to look for a valley for protection for the tent; the sky was turning threatening.

"– Veuillez me suivre, je vous prie. Si le détroit de Smith nous est fermé, il n’en est pas de même du détroit de Lancastre, sur la côte ouest de la mer de Baffin ; selon moi, nous devons remonter ce détroit jusqu’à celui de Barrow, et de là jusqu’à l’île Beechey ; la route a été cent fois parcourue par des navires à voiles ; nous ne serons donc pas embarrassés avec un brick à hélice. Une fois à l’île Beechey, nous suivrons le canal Wellington aussi avant que possible, vers le nord, jusqu’au débouché de ce chenal qui fait communiquer le canal Wellington avec le canal de la Reine, à l’endroit même où fut aperçue la mer libre.

If Smith Sound is closed to us, the same is not true of Lancaster Sound, on the west coast of Baffin's Sea; in my opinion, we must ascend this strait to that of Barrow, and thence to Beechey Island; the route has been traveled a hundred times by sailing ships; we shall therefore not be embarrassed with a propeller-driven brig. Once at Beechey Island, we will follow the Wellington Channel as far north as possible, to the mouth of this channel which connects the Wellington Channel with the Queen's Channel, at the very place where we saw the open sea. However, we are only at May 20; in a month, if circumstances favor us, we will have reached this point, and from there we will rush towards the pole. What do you think, gentlemen?","""Be good enough to look here. If Smith's Sound is closed, Lancaster Sound is not, to the west of Baffin's Bay; in my opinion, we ought to go up this sound as far as Barrow Strait, and thence to Beechey Island.

Once at Beechey Island, we shall follow Wellington Sound as far northward as possible, to where it meets the channel, connecting it with Queen's Sound, at the place where the open sea was seen.

"– Je n’exagère rien ! Croyez-vous que l’équipage soit fâché des obstacles que je rencontre sur mon chemin ? Au contraire ! On espère qu’ils me feront abandonner mes projets ! Aussi, ces gens ne murmurent pas, et tant que le Forward aura le cap au sud, il en sera de même. Les fous ! ils s’imaginent qu’ils se rapprochent de l’Angleterre ! Mais si je parviens à remonter au nord, vous verrez les choses changer ! Je jure Dieu pourtant, que pas un être vivant ne me fera dévier de ma ligne de conduite !

Do you think the crew is angry at the obstacles I encounter on my way? On the contrary ! We hope they will make me abandon my plans! Also, these people don't whisper, and as long as the Forward is heading south, it will be the same. Crazypeople ! they imagine that they are approaching England! But if I manage to go north, you will see things change! I swear to God, however, that not a living being will deviate me from my line of conduct!

But when I'm turned towards the north, you will see a difference! I swear solemnly that no living being shall make me swerve from my course!

"Mais, bien qu’il ne chassât pas, le docteur n’avait pas le temps de faire le géologue ; il ne pouvait être savant qu’au pas de course, car ses compagnons marchaient rapidement. Cependant il étudiait le terrain, et il causait le plus possible, car, sans lui, un silence absolu eût régné dans la petite troupe. Altamont n’avait aucune envie de parler au capitaine, qui ne désirait pas lui répondre.","But, although he did not hunt, the doctor had no time to play the geologist; he could only be learned at a run, for his companions walked rapidly. However, he studied the ground, and he talked as much as possible, for, without him, absolute silence would have reigned in the little troop. Altamont had no desire to speak to the captain, who did not wish to answer him.","But, although he was not hunting, the doctor had not time to geologize; he had to walk too quickly, in order to keep up with his friends. Still, he observed the land and talked as much as possible, for had he not there would have been total silence in the little band; neither Altamont nor the captain had any desire to talk to one another.","Although they were not actively hunting, the doctor still did not have time to act as a geologist; he could only behave scientifically at a canter, for his companions walked quickly. Nevertheless, he did study the terrain all the while, and he spoke as much as possible, for without him an absolute silence would have sunk over the little group. Altamont had no wish to speak to the captain, who did not want to answer him."
"Clifton se contenta de remarquer qu’il y avait deux degrés du soixante-douzième au soixante-quatorzième : cela faisait déjà cent vingt-cinq livres à son crédit. Mais on lui fit observer que la fortune dans ces parages était peu de chose, qu’on ne pouvait se dire riche qu’à la condition de boire sa richesse ; il semblait donc convenable d’attendre le moment où l’on roulerait sous la table d’une taverne de Liverpool, pour se réjouir et se frotter les mains.","Clifton contented himself with remarking that there were two degrees from the seventy-second to the seventy-fourth: that was already a hundred and twenty-five pounds to his credit. But it was pointed out to him that fortune in these parts was a small thing, that one could only call oneself rich on condition of drinking one's wealth; so it seemed proper to wait until the moment when one rolled under the table of a Liverpool tavern, to rejoice and rub one's hands.","Clifton contented himself with remarking that there were two degrees between latitude 72° and latitude 74 °: that was £125 to his credit. But they told him that a fortune did not amount to much up there, and that a man could be called rich only when he could have a chance to drink to his wealth; it seemed better to wait for the moment when they could meet at some tavern in Liverpool before rejoicing and rubbing their hands. * * *","Clifton merely remarked that from the seventy-second to seventy-fourth degree made two degrees, which added £125 to his account.

"Cependant, il semblait difficile qu’un cadavre s’y reposât ; il n’y avait pas de plage, et la mer déferlait sur des rocs abrupts ; une cendre épaisse et vierge de toute trace humaine recouvrait leur surface au-delà de la portée des vagues.","However, it seemed difficult for a corpse to rest there; there was no beach, and the sea rolled over steep rocks; a thick ash, devoid of any human trace, covered their surface beyond the reach of the waves.","Still, it seemed unlikely that any corpse should rest there; there was no beach, and the sea beat against the steep rocks; thick ashes, on which no human foot had ever stepped, covered the ground beyond the reach of the waves.","However, it did not seem likely that a body could be lying there; there was no beach, and the sea broke abruptly on the rocks; thick ash, untouched by humans, covered them where the waves could not reach."
"– Eh bien, non ! s’écria l’Américain. Non ! la vérité avant l’amour-propre ! Non ! je n’ai pas eu cette grande pensée qui vous a entraînés jusqu’ici. Je cherchais à franchir, avec mon navire, le passage du nord-ouest, et voilà tout.","- Well no ! cried the American. Nope ! truth before self-esteem! Nope ! I didn't have that great thought that brought you here. I was trying to get my ship through the Northwest Passage, and that was it.","""Well, no,"" answered the American,—""no; tell the truth, and shame the Devil! No, I did not have this great idea, which has brought you here. I was trying simply to sail through the Northwest Passage, that is all.""","‘Well, no! The truth before self-interest! I did not have that glorious idea which brought you here. I was trying to sail the Northwest Passage, that’s all.’"
"– Oui ! reprit Hatteras avec force, j’ai dit qu’un Anglais mettrait le pied sur le pôle du monde ; je l’ai dit, et un Anglais le fera.","- Yes ! resumed Hatteras with force, I said that an Englishman would set foot on the pole of the world; I said it, and an Englishman will do it.","""Yes!"" resumed Hatteras, earnestly, ""I said that an Englishman should set foot on the Pole; I said it, and an Englishman shall do it.""","‘Yes,’ said Hatteras forcefully; ‘I said that a Briton would set foot on the Pole of the globe; I said it, and it shall come to pass.’"

"– Ma foi, dit Johnson, voilà qui vient à propos pour éclairer la discussion. J’aperçois au large une pièce de bois d’une jolie dimension ; si le commandant veut le permettre, nous allons pêcher ce tronc d’arbre, le hisser à bord, et lui demander le nom de son pays.","“Faith,” said Johnson, “that comes in handy to clear up the discussion. I see off a piece of wood of a pretty size; if the captain wants to allow it, we will fish this tree trunk, hoist it on board, and ask him the name of his country.","""See there,"" said Johnson, ""there's something that will throw light on this discussion. It's a large piece of wood floating on the water; if the commander will give us leave, we can put a rope about it, hoist it on board, and ask it the name of its country.""","‘Upon my word,’ said Johnson, ‘abreast is a timely illustration of what we’re talking about.

"– Vous voyez cette pointe, reprit Johnson ; quand nous l’aurons doublée, nous serons bien près de notre mouillage. Oui, c’est bien de cet endroit que nous sommes partis pour l’Angleterre avec le lieutenant Creswell et les douze malades de l’Investigator.

But, Captain, I think it's here we ought to anchor.""","‘Can you see that point?’ said Johnson. ‘When we’ve rounded it, we’ll be near the landing point. We left from there for Britain with Lieutenant Cresswell and the twelve sick men from the Investigator.

"– Vous avez raison, mon ami, mais nous n’avons pas à craindre d’être engloutis ; la résistance de cette blanche écorce par ces froids de trente-trois degrés est considérable ! Remarquez qu’elle tend de plus en plus à s’accroître, car, sous ces latitudes, la neige tombe neuf jours sur dix, même en avril, même en mai, même en juin, et j’estime que sa plus forte épaisseur ne doit pas être éloignée de mesurer trente ou quarante pieds.","“You are right, my friend, but we need not fear being swallowed up; the resistance of this white bark to these cold temperatures of thirty-three degrees is considerable! Note that it tends more and more to increase, because, in these latitudes, the snow falls nine days out of ten, even in April, even in May, even in June, and I estimate that its greatest thickness does not should not be far from measuring thirty or forty feet.","""You are right, my friend, but we need not fear being swallowed; with such cold as this the ice is very strong. Besides, it has a constant tendency to get thicker, for snow falls nine days out of ten, even in April, May, and June, and I fancy it must be something like thirty or forty feet thick.""","‘You’re right, my friend, but there’s no danger of drowning; the strength of this white crust is considerable at minus thirty-three degrees. Indeed, it’s getting stronger every day, for at these latitudes the snow falls nine days out of ten, even in April, May, and June; and so I estimate that the crust must be nearly thirty or forty feet thick.’"
"– C’est décidé, répondit Hatteras d’un ton inébranlable, et, puisque les prières de l’ami ne suffisent pas, le capitaine commande.","“It is decided,” answered Hatteras in an unwavering tone, and, since the friend’s prayers are not enough, the captain commands.","""It is settled,"" said Hatteras, in a tone of command; ""and since my entreaties as a friend are not enough, I order it as captain.""","‘It’s decided!’ replied Hatteras in an unshakeable tone.

"Mais il n’y avait pas à revenir sur sa décision ; le traîneau chargé et attelé attendait sur le champ de glace ; Bell prit les devants ; les autres suivirent.

"– Vous savez, mes amis, quels furent les débuts de Franklin ; il fut mousse comme Cook et Nelson ; après avoir employé sa jeunesse à de grandes expéditions maritimes, il résolut en 1845 de s’élancer à la recherche du passage du nord-ouest ; il commandait l’Erebus et le Terror, deux navires éprouvés qui venaient de faire avec James Ross, en 1840, une campagne au pôle antarctique. L’Erebus, monté par Franklin, portait soixante-dix hommes d’équipage, tant officiers que matelots, avec Fitz-James pour capitaine, Gore, Le Vesconte, pour lieutenants, Des Voeux, Sargent, Couch, pour maîtres d’équipage, et Stanley pour chirurgien. Le Terror comptait soixante-huit hommes, capitaine Crozier, lieutenants, Little Hogdson et Irving, maîtres d’équipage, Horesby et Thomas, chirurgien, Peddie. Vous pouvez lire aux baies, aux caps, aux détroits, aux pointes, aux canaux, aux îles de ces parages, le nom de la plupart de ces infortunés dont pas un n’a revu son pays ! En tout cent trente-huit hommes ! Nous savons que les dernières lettres de Franklin sont adressées de l’île Disko et datées du 12 juillet 1845. « J’espère, disait-il, appareiller cette nuit pour le détroit de Lancastre. » Que s’est-il passé depuis son départ de la baie de Disko ? Les capitaines des baleiniers le Prince de Galles et l’Entreprise aperçurent une dernière fois les deux navires dans la baie Melville, et, depuis ce jour, on n’entendit plus parler d’eux. Cependant nous pouvons suivre Franklin dans sa marche vers l’ouest ; il s’engage par les détroits de Lancastre et de Barrow, arrive à l’île Beechey où il passe l’hiver de 1845 à 1846.","“You know, my friends, what Franklin's beginnings were; he was a cabin boy like Cook and Nelson; after employing his youth in great maritime expeditions, he resolved in 1845 to set off in search of the northwest passage; he was in command of the Erebus and the Terror, two proven ships which had just made with James Ross, in 1840, a campaign at the Antarctic Pole. The Erebus, manned by Franklin, carried seventy crewmen, both officers and sailors, with Fitz-James for captain, Gore, Le Vesconte, for lieutenants, Des Voeux, Sargent, Couch, for boatswains, and Stanley for surgeon. The Terror had sixty-eight men, Captain Crozier, lieutenants, Little Hogdson and Irving, boatswains, Horesby and Thomas, surgeon, Peddie. You can read in the bays, in the capes, in the straits, in the points, in the channels, in the islands of these parts, the name of most of these unfortunate people, not one of whom has seen his country again! In all one hundred and thirty-eight men! We know that Franklin's last letters are addressed from Disko Island and dated July 12, 1845. ""I hope,"" he said, ""to set sail to-night for Lancaster Sound."" What has happened since he left Disko Bay? The captains of the whalers Prince of Wales and Enterprise saw the two ships one last time in Melville Bay, and from that day nothing was heard of them. However, we can follow Franklin on his march west; he entered through the straits of Lancaster and Barrow, arrived at Beechey Island where he spent the winter from 1845 to 1846.","""You know, my friends, how Franklin began: like Cook and Nelson, he was first a cabin-boy; after spending his youth in long sea-voyages, he made up his mind, in 1845, to seek the Northwest Passage; he commanded the Erebus and the Terror, two stanch vessels, which had visited the antarctic seas in 1840, under the command of James Ross. The Erebus, in which Franklin sailed, carried a crew of seventy men, all told, with Fitz-James as captain; Gore and Le Vesconte, lieutenants; Des Voeux, Sargent, and Couch, boatswains; and Stanley, surgeon. The Terror carried sixty-eight men. Crozier was the captain; the lieutenants were Little, Hodgson, and Irving; boatswains, Horesby and Thomas; the surgeon, Peddie.

He said, 'I hope to set sail to-night for Lancaster Sound.' What followed his departure from Disco Bay? The captains of the whalers, the Prince of Wales and the Enterprise, saw these two ships for the last time in Melville Bay, and nothing more was heard of them.

"La navigation du Forward, malgré une forte brise du nord-est, fut assez facile pour que, le 23 juin, il dépassât le soixante-quatorzième degré de latitude. Il se trouvait au milieu du bassin de Melville, l’une des mers les plus considérables de ces régions.

"Aussi, aux yeux des spectateurs stupéfaits, se produisait-il parfois de véritables changements à vue ; le pays se métamorphosait ; la montagne devenait plaine sous l’attraction d’un brusque dégel ; lorsque l’eau du ciel, infiltrée dans les fissures des grands blocs, se solidifiait au froid d’une seule nuit, elle brisait alors tout obstacle par son irrésistible expansion, plus puissante encore en se faisant glace qu’en devenant vapeur, et le phénomène s’accomplissait avec une épouvantable instantanéité.","Also, in the eyes of the amazed spectators, there sometimes occurred real changes on sight; the country was changing; the mountain became plain under the attraction of a sudden thaw; when the water from the sky, infiltrated into the cracks of the large blocks, solidified in the cold of a single night, it then broke all obstacles by its irresistible expansion, more powerful still by turning into ice than by becoming vapour, and the phenomenon took place with terrible instantaneity.","So the amazed spectators see wonderful changes in the appearance of the country; the mountain becomes a plain under the action of a sudden thaw; when the rain has filtered into the fissures of the great blocks and freezes in a single night, it breaks everything by its irresistible expansion, which is more powerful in forming ice than in forming vapor: the phenomenon takes place with terrible swiftness.","So sometimes real changes in the view happened before the very eyes of the stupefied watchers; the land metamorphosed; a mountain became a plain due to a sudden thaw; when water from the sky got into cracks between great blocks and froze in the cold of a single night, its irresistible expansion could break any obstacle, water becoming a more powerful force when it turns into ice than into water vapour, and this phenomenon happened with frightening instantaneity."
"– Docteur, répondit ce dernier, cette terre étant une terre américaine, je désire que mon nom n’y figure pas.","“Doctor,” replied the latter, “this land being an American land, I do not wish my name to appear there.","""Doctor,"" answered Hatteras, ""since this is an American land, I don't care to have my name figure here.""","‘Doctor, since this land is American I don’t want my name on it.’"

"Cependant Hatteras se laissait voir par intervalles à travers les colonnes de fumée et sous les pluies de cendre. Tantôt son bras, tantôt sa tête sortaient du tourbillon.

"Bonnes bêtes, après tout, que ces chiens Groënlandais ; leur sauvage nature s’était formée peu à peu ; ils perdaient de leur ressemblance avec le loup, pour se rapprocher de Duk, ce modèle achevé de la race canine : en un mot, ils se civilisaient.","Good animals, after all, these Greenland dogs; their savage nature had been formed little by little; they lost their resemblance to the wolf, to get closer to Duk, this perfect model of the canine race: in a word, they became civilized.","After all, these Greenland dogs are kind beasts.

"Les hiverneurs se retrouvèrent donc condamnés à une nouvelle inactivité ; pendant quinze jours, du 11 au 25 mai, leur existence monotone ne fut marquée que par un seul incident, une maladie grave, une angine couenneuse, qui vint frapper le charpentier inopinément ; à ses amygdales fortement tuméfiées et à la fausse membrane qui les tapissait, le docteur ne put se méprendre sur la nature de ce terrible mal ; mais il se trouvait là dans son élément, et la maladie, qui n’avait pas compté sur lui sans doute, fut rapidement détournée.

"Cependant les neiges fondaient de toutes parts, sous l’action du soleil ; l’eau salée, répandue sur l’ice-field par les crevasses et les trous de phoque, en hâtait la décomposition ; mélangée à l’eau de mer, la glace formait une sorte de pâte sale à laquelle les navigateurs arctiques donnent le nom de « slush ».

"La faune de cette contrée était supérieure à cette flore si restreinte ; le docteur aperçut de longues troupes d’oies et de grues qui s’enfonçaient dans le nord ; les perdrix, les eider-ducks d’un bleu noir, les chevaliers, sorte d’échassiers de la classe des scolopax, des northern-divers, plongeurs au corps très long, de nombreux ptarmites, espèce de gelinottes fort bonnes à manger, les dovekies avec le corps noir, les ailes, tachetées de blanc, les pattes et le bec rouges comme du corail, les bandes criardes de kitty-wakes, et les gros loons au ventre blanc, représentaient dignement l’ordre des oiseaux. Le docteur fut assez heureux pour tuer quelques lièvres gris qui n’avaient pas encore revêtu leur blanche fourrure d’hiver, et un renard bleu que Duk força avec un remarquable talent. Quelques ours, habitués évidemment à redouter la présence de l’homme, ne se laissèrent pas approcher, et les phoques étaient extrêmement fuyards, par la même raison sans doute que leurs ennemis les ours. La baie regorgeait d’une sorte de buccin fort agréable à déguster. La classe des animaux articulés, ordre des diptères, famille des culicides, division des némocères, fut représentée par un simple moustique, un seul, dont le docteur eut la joie de s’emparer après avoir subi ses morsures. En qualité de conchyliologue, il fut moins favorisé, et il dut se borner à recueillir une sorte de moule et quelques coquilles bivalves.","The fauna of this country was superior to this very limited flora; the doctor saw long flocks of geese and cranes plunging into the north; partridges, blue-black eider-ducks, knights, a sort of wading bird of the scolopax class, northern divers, very long-bodied divers, numerous ptarmites, a kind of grouse very good to eat, dovekies with black bodies, wings, speckled with white, legs and beaks red as coral, the garish bands of kitty-wakes, and the large white-bellied loons, fittingly represented the order of birds. The doctor was fortunate enough to kill a few gray hares that had not yet put on their white winter fur, and a blue fox which Duk forced with remarkable skill. A few bears, obviously accustomed to dreading the presence of man, did not allow themselves to be approached, and the seals were extremely flighty, no doubt for the same reason as their enemies the bears. The bay was full of a kind of whelk very pleasant to taste. The class of articulated animals, order Diptera, family Culicides, division Nemoceres, was represented by a simple mosquito, a single one, which the doctor had the joy of seizing after suffering his bites. As a conchologist, he was less fortunate, and he had to confine himself to collecting a kind of mussel and a few bivalve shells.","The fauna of this country was much richer; the doctor saw large flocks of geese and cranes flying northward; partridges, eider-ducks, northern divers, numerous ptarmigans, which are delicious eating, noisy flocks of kittiwakes, and great white-bellied loons represented the winged tribe. The doctor was lucky enough to kill some gray hares, which had not yet put on their white winter coat of fur, and a blue fox, which Duke skilfully caught. A few bears, evidently accustomed to fear men, could not be approached, and the seals were very timid, probably for the same reason. The harbor was full of a very good tasting shellfish. The genus articulata, order diptera, family culicides, division nemocera, was represented by a simple mosquito, a single one, which the doctor, though much bitten, had the pleasure of catching. As a conchologist, he was less fortunate, and he was obliged to content himself with a sort of mussel and some bivalves. * * *","In this region there appeared more fauna than such limited flora; the doctor noticed long flocks of geese and cranes flying north; the order of birds was fully represented by the partridges, the blue-black eider-ducks, the sandpipers, a sort of surfbird of the class of wood-cocks, the northern divers with very long bodies, the many ptarmites, a sort of grouse, very good to eat,* the dovekies with black bodies, white spots on their wings, and feet and beaks as red as coral, the loud bands of kittywakes and the big loons with their white stomachs.

"Le vendredi, à dix heures, le cap Warender fut dépassé sur la côte droite du détroit, et sur la gauche, l’Admiralty-Inlet, baie encore peu explorée par des navigateurs qui avaient hâte de se porter dans l’ouest.

"– On a cherché à l’expliquer, mais d’une façon peu satisfaisante ; ainsi, il vint à l’esprit d’Halley qu’une comète, ayant jadis choqué obliquement la terre, changea la position de son axe de rotation, c’est-à-dire de ses pôles ; d’après lui, le pôle Nord, situé autrefois à la baie d’Hudson, se trouva reporté plus à l’est, et les contrées de l’ancien pôle, si longtemps gelées, conservèrent un froid plus considérable, que de longs siècles de soleil n’ont encore pu réchauffer.","– We tried to explain it, but in an unsatisfactory way; thus it occurred to Halley that a comet, having once struck the earth obliquely, changed the position of its axis of rotation, that is, of its poles; according to him, the North Pole, formerly located at Hudson Bay, was pushed further east, and the countries of the old pole, frozen for so long, preserved a colder temperature more considerable than long centuries. of sun have not yet been able to warm up.","""No very satisfactory explanation has ever been given; so it occurred to Hadley* that a comet had come into collision with the earth and had altered the position of its axis of rotation, that is to say, of its poles; according to him, the North Pole, which used to be situated at Hudson's Bay, found itself carried farther east, and the land at the old Pole preserved a greater cold, which long centuries of the sun have not yet heated.""","‘People haven’t really explained it very convincingly; it occurred to Halley* that a comet, obliquely hitting the earth in the past, changed its axis of rotation, that is its Poles.

"– Décidément, dit Altamont au docteur, nous ne sommes pas heureux dans nos chasses ; je conviens que le pays offre peu de ressources aux animaux ; mais le gibier des terres boréales n’a pas le droit d’être difficile, et il aurait pu se montrer plus complaisant.","“Decidedly,” said Altamont to the doctor, “we are not happy in our hunts; I agree that the country offers few resources to animals; but the game of the boreal lands has no right to be difficult, and it could have been more complacent.","""We have no luck,"" said Altamont to the doctor; ""to be sure, the country doesn't offer much food to animals, but the game here ought not to be over-particular, and ought to show itself.""","‘Our hunts are not lucky,’ Altamont said to the doctor; ‘I admit this region has few resources for animals; but the game here in the north hasn’t got the right to be difficult, and it should be more cooperative.’"

"– Sans cela, monsieur Clawbonny, répondit Johnson, on n’y résisterait pas. Maintenant, nous pouvons sans crainte élever une muraille de neige jusqu’à la hauteur du plat-bord ; et, si nous voulons, nous lui donnerons dix pieds d’épaisseur, car les matériaux ne manquent pas.","“Other than that, Mr. Clawbonny,” replied Johnson, “we couldn't resist.

"– Pour mon compte, reprit Hatteras, dussé-je aller seul, j’irai jusqu’au pôle nord ; nous en sommes à trois cent soixante milles au plus.

What are your plans in this regard?","""As for me,"" continued Hatteras, ""if I have to go alone, I shall go to the North Pole; we are only three hundred and sixty miles from it at the outside.

"Les hommes de l’équipage furent divisés en deux bordées de tribord et de bâbord ; chacun d’eux, armé d’une longue perche garnie d’une pointe de fer, repoussait les glaçons trop menaçants. Bientôt le Forward entra dans une passe si étroite, entre deux blocs élevés, que l’extrémité de ses vergues froissa ces murailles aussi dures que le roc ; peu à peu il s’engagea dans une vallée sinueuse remplie du tourbillon des neiges, tandis que les glaces flottantes se heurtaient et se brisaient avec de sinistres craquements.","The men of the crew were divided into two broadsides on starboard and port; each of them, armed with a long pole topped with an iron spike, repelled the too threatening icicles. Soon the Forward entered a pass so narrow, between two lofty blocks, that the end of her yards crumpled these walls as hard as rock; little by little he entered a winding valley filled with the whirlwind of snow, while the floating ice collided and broke with sinister cracks.","The crew were divided into two forces, and one stationed on the starboard, the other on the larboard side; every man was given a long iron-headed pole, with which to ward off threatening pieces of ice. Soon the Forward entered such a narrow passage between two lofty pieces, that the ends of the yards touched its solid walls; gradually it penetrated farther into a winding valley filled with a whirlwind of snow, while the floating ice was crashing ominously all about.","The crew were divided into two teams, starboard and port, and each man took a long pole with an iron tip and pushed back the most menacing pieces of ice. Soon the Forward ventured into a tall pass that was so narrow on both sides that the end of its yards grazed the walls, as hard as rock. Foot by foot she moved into a sinuous valley filled with flurries of snow while the floating ice collided and broke with sinister cracking noises."

"– Remarquons cette place avec soin, leur dit-il ; il est fort possible que, l’été venu, nous rencontrions ici des phoques par centaines ; ils se laissent facilement approcher dans les parages peu fréquentés des hommes, et on s’en empare aisément.

"La baleine dans sa course s’éloignait du brick et s’avançait vers les ice-bergs en mouvement ; pendant une demi-heure, elle fila ainsi ; il fallait mouiller la corde du harpon pour qu’elle ne prît pas feu par le frottement.

"– Alors, reprit le docteur, les navires de l’escadre Belcher commencent à revenir peu à peu ; pas tous, car sir Edward dut abandonner l’Assistance en 1854, ainsi que MacClure avait fait de l’Investigator en 1853. Sur ces entrefaites, le docteur Rae, par une lettre datée du 29 juillet 1854, et adressée de Repulse-Bay où il était parvenu par l’Amérique, fit connaître que les Esquimaux de la terre du roi Guillaume possédaient différents objets provenant de l’Erebus et du Terror ; pas de doute possible alors sur la destinée de l’expédition ; le Phénix, le North-Star, et le navire de Collinson revinrent en Angleterre ; il n’y eut plus de bâtiment anglais dans les mers arctiques. Mais si le gouvernement semblait avoir perdu tout espoir, lady Franklin espérait encore, et des débris de sa fortune elle équipa le Fox, commandé par MacClintock ; il partit en 1857, hiverna dans les parages où vous nous êtes apparu, capitaine, parvint à l’île Beechey, le 11 août 1858, hiverna une seconde fois au détroit de Bellot, reprit ses recherches en février 1859, le 6 mai, découvrit le document qui ne laissa plus de doute sur la destinée de l’Erebus et du Terror, et revint en Angleterre à la fin de la même année. Voilà tout ce qui s’est passé pendant quinze ans dans ces contrées funestes, et depuis le retour du Fox, pas un navire n’est revenu tenter la fortune au milieu de ces dangereuses mers !","“Then,” resumed the doctor, “the ships of the Belcher squadron begin to return little by little; not all of them, for Sir Edward had to leave the Assistancy in 1854, as MacClure had done with the Investigator in 1853. he had arrived by way of America, made it known that the Eskimos of the land of King William possessed various objects coming from Erebus and Terror; no possible doubt then about the destiny of the expedition; the Phoenix, the North-Star, and Collinson's ship returned to England; there were no more English ships in the Arctic seas. But if the government seemed to have lost all hope, Lady Franklin still hoped, and with the remains of her fortune she outfitted the Fox, commanded by MacClintock; he left in 1857, wintered in the area where you appeared to us, captain, arrived at Beechey Island on August 11, 1858, wintered a second time in Bellot Strait, resumed his research in February 1859, on May 6, discovered the document which left no doubt as to the destiny of the Erebus and the Terror, and returned to England at the end of the same year.

But if the government seemed to have lost all hope, Lady Franklin did not despair, and with what was left of her fortune she fitted out the Fox, commanded by MacClintock; he set sail in 1857, wintered about where you made yourself known to us, Captain; he came to Beechey Island, August 11, 1858; the next winter he passed at Bellot Sound; in February, 1859, he began his explorations anew; on the 6th of May he found the document which left no further doubt as to the fate of the Erebus and Terror, and returned to England at the end of the same year. That is a complete account of all that has been done in these regions during the last fifteen years; and since the return of the Fox, no ship has ventured among these dangerous waters!""","* ‘Then the ships of the Belcher fleet began to gradually come back; not all, for Sir Edward had to abandon the Assistance in 1854, like McClure the Investigator in 1853.

– Parlez donc ! fit l’Américain.,- Speak up! said the American.,"""Go on, Doctor,"" said the American.","‘Speak then,’ said the American."
"Ces craintes fermentaient dans sa tête ; mais il fallait prendre un parti ; il vira de bord, et s’enfonça vers le sud.","These fears fermented in his head; but a decision had to be made; he veered, and headed south.",These fears tormented him; but he had to decide; he put about and started for the south.,"These fears fermented in his head, but he did have to choose a course of action; he tacked about and plunged southwards."
"Cependant, la fin d’avril n’amenait pas le printemps polaire ; l’heure du renouvellement n’avait pas sonné ; il s’en fallait de six semaines au moins ; les rayons du soleil, trop faibles encore, ne pouvaient fouiller ces plaines de neige et faire jaillir du sol les maigres produits de la flore boréale. On devait craindre que les animaux ne fussent rares, oiseaux ou quadrupèdes. Cependant un lièvre, quelques couples de ptarmigans, un jeune renard même eussent figuré avec honneur sur la table de Doctor’s-House, et les chasseurs résolurent de chasser avec acharnement tout ce qui passerait à portée de leur fusil.","However, the end of April did not bring the polar spring; the hour of renewal had not come; at least six weeks were needed; the rays of the sun, still too feeble, could not search these plains of snow and cause the meager products of the boreal flora to spring from the ground. It was to be feared that the animals were rare, birds or quadrupeds. However, a hare, a few pairs of ptarmigans, even a young fox would have figured with honor on the table of Doctor's House, and the hunters resolved to hunt with determination all that came within range of their guns.","Still the end of April did not bring with it the polar spring, which was yet six weeks off; the sun's rays were still too feeble to melt the snow or to nourish the few plants of these regions. They feared lest animals should be scarce, both birds and quadrupeds. But a hare, a few ptarmigans, even a young fox, would have been welcome to the table of Doctor's House, and the hunters resolved to shoot whatever should come within range.","However, the end of April did not bring the polar spring; the time for new life had not yet come; at least six more weeks were needed; still too weak, the sunlight was unable to burrow into the snowy plains and persuade the meagre population of boreal flora to thrust up from the ground. It was to be feared that living creatures would be scarce, whether birds or four-footed. All the same, if they could only catch a hare, a few brace of ptarmigan, or even a young fox, it would honour the table of Doctor’s House, and so the huntsmen resolved to try to hunt down anything coming within range of their rifles."
"Bientôt le Forward fut hors des bassins, et, dirigé par un pilote de Liverpool, dont le petit cotre suivait à distance, il prit le courant de la Mersey. La foule se précipita sur le quai extérieur qui longe les Docks Victoria, afin d’entrevoir une dernière fois ce navire étrange. Les deux huniers, la misaine et la brigantine furent rapidement établis, et, sous cette voilure, le Forward, digne de son nom, après avoir contourné la pointe de Birkenhead, donna à toute vitesse dans la mer d’Irlande.","Soon the Forward was out of the docks, and, steered by a Liverpool pilot, whose little cutter was following at a distance, she took the current of the Mersey. The crowd rushed to the outer quay that runs along the Victoria Docks, to get a last glimpse of this strange ship. The two topsails, the foresail and the brigantine were quickly rigged, and under this sail the Forward, worthy of her name, after rounding the point of Birkenhead, gave full speed into the Irish Sea.","Soon the Forward had left the docks, and under the care of a pilot, whose boat followed at a distance, put out into the stream. The crowd hastened to the outer quay by the Victoria Docks to get a last look at the strange vessel. The two topsails, the foresail, and staysail were soon set, and under this canvas the Forward, which well deserved its name, after rounding Birkenhead Point, sailed away into the Irish Sea.","Soon the Forward was out of the docks, and, directed by a Liverpool pilot, whose small cutter followed at a distance, it found the current of the Mersey. The crowd rushed on to the external wharf which surrounds the Victoria Docks, in order to glimpse this strange ship one last time. The two topsails, the foresail, and the brigantine were quickly hoisted, and, under this sail, the Forward, worthy of its name, after rounding the headland of Birkenhead, headed at full speed into the Irish Sea."
"Le ministre luthérien et sa femme, avec lesquels le docteur se promettait de causer plus spécialement, se trouvaient en tournée du côté de Proven, au sud d’Uppernawik ; il fut donc réduit à s’entretenir avec le gouverneur. Ce premier magistrat ne paraissait pas fort lettré ; un peu moins, c’était un âne ; un peu plus, il savait lire.","The Lutheran minister and his wife, with whom the doctor promised himself to talk more especially, were on tour in the direction of Proven, south of Uppernawik; he was therefore reduced to conversing with the governor. This first magistrate did not appear to be very well-read; a little less, it was a donkey; a little more, he could read.","The Lutheran minister and his wife, with whom the doctor had promised himself an interesting talk, happened to be away on the shore of Proven, south of Upernavik; hence he was compelled to seek the company of the Governor.

"Mais, en somme, les glaces étaient rares, et elles n’auraient pu gêner la marche d’un navire. Il faut remarquer que la chaloupe se trouvait alors à dix degrés au-dessus du pôle du froid, et, au point de vue des parallèles de température, c’est comme si elle eût été à dix degrés au-dessous. Rien d’étonnant, dès lors, que la mer fût libre à cette époque, comme elle le devait être par le travers de la baie de Disko, dans la mer de Baffin. Ainsi donc, un bâtiment aurait eu là ses coudées franches pendant les mois d’été.","But, on the whole, the ice was rare, and it could not have impeded the progress of a ship. It should be noted that the boat was then ten degrees above the pole of cold, and, from the point of view of the parallels of temperature, it is as if it had been ten degrees below. No wonder, then, that the sea was open at that time, as it must have been abeam Disko Bay in Baffin's Bay. Thus, a building would have had its free rein there during the summer months.","But the ice grew rarer, and was not enough to interfere with the boat. It is to be remembered that the launch was then ten degrees above the pole of cold; and as to the parallels of temperature, they might as well have been ten degrees to the other side. There was nothing surprising in the sea being open at this epoch, as it must have been at Disco Island in Baffin's Bay. So a sailing vessel would have plenty of sailing room in the summer months.","In sum, ice was rare, and could not have slowed a ship. It should be noted that the launch was now ten degrees above the pole of cold, and as regards the temperature parallels, it was as if they were ten degrees below. Not surprisingly, the sea was free at this season, as surely as Disko Bay and Baffin Bay were. So a vessel would have been able to sail freely in the summer months."
"Le docteur était ému ; il regarda l’ours, qui donnait des signes d’une agitation plus violente, comme s’il se fût senti menacé d’un danger prochain.","The doctor was moved; he looked at the bear, which gave signs of more violent agitation, as if it felt threatened by imminent danger.","The doctor was agitated; he looked at the bear, which had grown excited, as if he had become conscious of the danger which threatened him.","The doctor felt agitated; he observed the bear, which himself showed signs of increasing agitation, as if realizing the impending danger."

"La côte occidentale de la Nouvelle-Amérique se prolongeait dans l’ouest par une suite de baies au-delà du cap Washington ; les voyageurs, pour éviter cette immense courbure, après avoir franchi les premières rampes de Bell-Mount, se dirigèrent vers le nord, en prenant par les plateaux supérieurs. C’était une notable économie de route ; Hatteras voulait, à moins que des obstacles imprévus de détroit et de montagne ne s’y opposassent, tirer une ligne droite de trois cent cinquante milles depuis le Fort-Providence jusqu’au pôle.","The west coast of New America extended westward in a series of bays beyond Cape Washington; the travelers, to avoid this immense curvature, after having crossed the first ramps of Bell-Mount, headed towards the north, taking by the upper plateaus. It was a notable economy of route; Hatteras intended, unless unforeseen obstacles of strait and mountain opposed it, to draw a straight line of three hundred and fifty miles from Fort Providence to the Pole.","The western shore of New America stretched out in a series of bays beyond Cape Washington; the travellers, to avoid this long curve, after crossing the first spurs of Mount Bell, turned northward over the upper plateaus. This was a great saving of time; Hatteras was anxious, unless prevented by seas or mountains, to make a straight line of three hundred and fifty miles to the Pole from Fort Providence.","The coast of New America stretched westwards, and consisted of a succession of bays beyond Cape Washington; the travellers decided to head north after crossing the first slopes of Mount Bell, following the other plateau, so as to avoid a huge curve.

"Cependant, jusqu’à cette époque, le temps fut assez favorable ; les perdrix et les lièvres seuls purent s’en plaindre, car les chasseurs ne leur laissaient pas un moment de repos ; on disposa plusieurs trappes à renard ; mais ces animaux soupçonneux ne s’y laissèrent pas prendre ; plusieurs fois même, ils grattèrent la neige au-dessous de la trappe, et s’emparèrent de l’appât sans courir aucun risque ; le docteur les donnait au diable, fort peiné toutefois de lui faire un semblable cadeau.","However, up to this time the weather was favorable enough; the partridges and the hares alone could complain of it, for the hunters did not give them a moment's rest; several fox traps were placed; but these suspicious animals were not deceived; several times they even scraped the snow under the trap, and seized the bait without running any risk; the doctor gave them to the devil, though very sorry to give him such a gift.","Still, up to this time the weather was very favorable; the partridges and hares alone had reason to complain, for the hunters gave them no rest; a great many traps were set for foxes, but these crafty animals could not be caught; very often they scraped the snow away beneath the trap and took the bait without running any risk; the doctor cursed them, being very averse to making them such a present.","All the same, the weather had been quite favourable until now; only the partridges and hares could complain, for the hunters gave them not a moment’s rest; a number of fox traps had been set, but these suspicious animals did not fall into them; several times they cleared the snow off the traps and took the bait without danger; the doctor sent them to the blazes, miserable at giving them such free gifts."

"Leurs regards s’étendirent alors sur un pays métamorphosé, fait de roches vives, d’arêtes aiguës, et entièrement dépourvu de glace. C’était l’été succédant brusquement à l’hiver chassé par la tempête ; la neige, rasée par l’ouragan comme par une lame affilée, n’avait pas eu le temps de se résoudre en eau, et le sol apparaissait dans toute son âpreté primitive.","Their gaze then extended over a metamorphosed country, made of sharp rocks, sharp edges, and entirely devoid of ice. It was summer following abruptly on winter chased away by the storm; the snow, razed by the hurricane as if by a sharp blade, had not had time to dissolve into water, and the ground appeared in all its primitive harshness.","Their eyes beheld an entirely altered country, composed of bare rocks, sharp ridges entirely clear of ice.

"La place fut déblayée avec rapidité, et Bell ramena un troisième corps, celui d’un homme de quarante ans ; il n’avait pas l’apparence cadavérique des autres ; le docteur se baissa sur lui, et crut surprendre encore quelques symptômes d’existence.","The place was quickly cleared, and Bell brought up a third body, that of a man of forty; he did not have the cadaverous appearance of the others; the doctor stooped over him, and thought he detected a few more symptoms of existence.","The place was rapidly cleared away, and Bell brought up a third body, that of a man of forty; he looked less like a corpse than the others; the doctor bent over him and thought he saw some signs of life.","The spot was speedily excavated and Bell brought up a third body, a forty-year-old man; he did not have the deathly appearance of the others; the doctor bent over, and thought he could detect signs of life."

"À la fin de ce récit, le Forward avait dépassé cette côte funeste, et Johnson perdit de vue le lieu de cette terrible catastrophe. Le lendemain, on laissait la baie Griffin sur tribord, et, deux jours après, les caps Grinnel et Helpman ; enfin, le 14 juillet, on doubla la pointe Osborn, et, le 15, le brick mouilla dans la baie Baring, à l’extrémité du canal. La navigation n’avait pas été très difficile ; Hatteras rencontra une mer presque aussi libre que celle dont Belcher profita pour aller hiverner avec le Pionnier et l’Assistance jusqu’auprès du soixante dix-septième degré. Ce fut de 1852 à 1853, pendant son premier hivernage, car, l’année suivante, il passa l’hiver de 1853 à 1854 à cette baie Baring où le Forward mouillait en ce moment.","At the end of this story, the Forward had passed this fatal coast, and Johnson lost sight of the place of this terrible catastrophe.

"Le jeudi, 26 juillet, le Forward rasa l’île Dundas, et mit ensuite le cap plus au nord ; mais alors il se trouva face à face avec une banquise, haute de huit à neuf pieds et formée de petits ice-bergs arrachés à la côte ; il fut obligé d’en prolonger longtemps la courbure dans l’ouest. Le craquement ininterrompu des glaces, se joignant aux gémissements du navire, formait un bruit triste qui tenait du soupir et de la plainte. Enfin le brick trouva une passe et s’y avança péniblement ; souvent, un glaçon énorme paralysait sa course pendant de longues heures ; le brouillard gênait la vue du pilote ; tant que l’on voit à un mille en avant, on peut parer facilement les obstacles ; mais au milieu de ces tourbillons embrumés, la vue s’arrêtait souvent à moins d’une encablure. La houle très forte fatiguait.","On Thursday, July 26, the Forward skimmed Dundas Island, and then set course further north; but then he found himself face to face with an ice floe, eight or nine feet high and formed of small icebergs torn from the coast; he was obliged to prolong its curvature to the west for a long time. The uninterrupted cracking of the ice, joining with the groans of the ship, formed a sad noise which resembled a sigh and a complaint. At last the brig found a pass and advanced painfully through it; often an enormous icicle paralyzed its course for long hours; the fog obstructed the pilot's view; as long as one sees a mile ahead, one can easily parry obstacles; but in the midst of these misty whirlwinds, the view often stopped at less than a cable's length. The very strong swell was tiring.","Thursday, July 26th, the Forward coasted along Dundas Island, and then stood more northward; but there she found herself face to face with a thick mass of ice, eight or nine feet high, consisting of little icebergs washed away from the shore; they had to prolong the curve they were making to the west. The continual cracking of the ice, joining with the creaking of the rolling ship, sounded like a gloomy lamentation. At last the brig found a passage and advanced through it slowly; often a huge floe delayed her for hours; the fog embarrassed the steersman; at one moment he could see a mile ahead, and it was easy to avoid all obstacles; but again the snow-squalls would hide everything from their sight at the distance of a cable's length. The sea ran very high.","On Thursday, 26 July the Forward hugged Dundas Island, and then veered north; but she soon found herself facing an ice shelf, eight or nine feet high, made up of small icebergs torn from the coast; so for a long time she was obliged to continue curving westwards. The continuous cracking of the ice added to the groans of the ship, to produce a sad sound, resembling sighs and complaints. Finally the brig found a pass and struggled into it; often an enormous ice floe would paralyse her route for long hours; the fog restricted the pilot’s view; provided he could see a mile ahead, obstacles could easily be avoided; but in the midst of the flurries, vision was often limited to less than a cable. The strong swell was tiring."

"Le Forward, dans la journée du 16 juin, rangea le cap Aworth.

Les glaciers, étalés en longues nappes blanches, projetaient une immense réverbération dans l’espace. La nature boréale aux prises avec le dégel offrait aux yeux un splendide spectacle. Le brick rasait la côte de fort près ; on apercevait sur quelques rocs abrités de rares bruyères dont les fleurs rosées sortaient timidement entre les neiges, des lichens maigres d’une couleur rougeâtre, et les pousses d’une espèce de saule nain, qui rampaient sur le sol.","The Forward, during the day of June 16, ranged Cape Aworth. Mount Rawlinson raised its white peaks to the sky; the snow and mist made it look colossal by exaggerating its distance; the temperature was kept a few degrees above ice; waterfalls and improvised cataracts developed on the sides of the mountain; the avalanches rushed in with a detonation similar to the continuous discharges of heavy artillery. The glaciers, spread out in long white sheets, projected an immense reverberation in space. The boreal nature struggling with the thaw offered a splendid spectacle to the eyes. The brig skimmed the coast very closely; On some sheltered rocks one could see rare heathers whose pink flowers emerged timidly between the snows, scanty lichens of a reddish color, and the shoots of a species of dwarf willow, which crawled on the ground.","The Forward sailed by Cape Alworth June 16th. Mount Rawlinson raised its white peaks towards the sky; the snow and mist exaggerated its size so that it appeared colossal; the temperature remained a few degrees above the freezing-point; cascades and cataracts appeared on the sides of the mountain; avalanches kept falling with a roar like that of artillery. The long stretches of glaciers made a loud echo. The contrast between this wintry scene and the thaw made a wonderful sight.

"À mesure que l’on s’élevait, l’ascension devenait de plus en plus difficile ; les flancs de la montagne se rapprochaient de la perpendiculaire, et il fallait prendre de grandes précautions pour éviter les éboulements. Souvent des colonnes de cendres se tordaient autour des voyageurs et menaçaient de les asphyxier, ou des torrents de lave leur barraient le passage. Sur quelques surfaces horizontales, les ruisseaux, refroidis et solidifiés à la partie supérieure, laissaient sous leur croûte durcie la lave s’écouler en bouillonnant. Chacun devait donc sonder pour éviter d’être plongé tout à coup dans ces matières en fusion.","As one rose, the ascent became more and more difficult; the sides of the mountain approached the perpendicular, and great precautions had to be taken to avoid landslides. Often columns of ash twisted around the travelers and threatened to asphyxiate them, or torrents of lava barred their way.

Everyone had to probe to avoid being suddenly plunged into these molten materials.","The ascent grew more difficult the higher they went; the sides of the mountain became nearly perpendicular, and they had to be very careful to avoid accident. Often columns of cinders were blown about them and threatened to choke them, or torrents of lava barred their path. On some such places these streams were hard on top, but the molten stream flowed beneath. Each one had to test it first to escape sinking into the glowing mass.","As the men climbed, the going became more and more difficult; the flanks of the mountain were approaching the vertical, and careful precautions had to be taken to avoid landslides. Often tall clouds of ash twisted around the travellers, threatening to suffocate them, and torrents of lava blocked their path. On the few horizontal parts, streams of lava, cooled and solid on the surface, allowed lava to flow bubbling under their hard crusts. Each man therefore had to carefully test the ground in front of him so as not to be suddenly plunged into the rivers of fire."

"– Ce fut vers le 24 ou le 25 janvier que l’on forma le projet d’abandonner le navire. On résolut de gagner la côte occidentale de la mer de Baffin ; de là, avec la chaloupe, on devait courir à la recherche des baleiniers, ou même atteindre les établissements Groënlandais de la côte orientale. Les provisions étaient abondantes ; les malades, excités par l’espérance du retour, allaient mieux. On commença donc les préparatifs du départ ; un traîneau fut construit, propre à transporter les vivres, le combustible et la chaloupe ; les hommes devaient s’y atteler. Cela prit jusqu’au 15 février. J’espérais toujours vous voir arriver, capitaine, et cependant je craignais votre présence ; vous n’auriez rien obtenu de l’équipage, qui vous eût plutôt massacré que de rester à bord. C’était comme une folie de liberté. Je pris tous mes compagnons les uns après les autres ; je leur parlai, je les exhortai, je leur fis comprendre les dangers d’une pareille expédition, en même temps que cette lâcheté de vous abandonner ! Je ne pus rien obtenir, même des meilleurs ! Le départ fut fixé au 22 février. Shandon était impatient. On entassa sur le traîneau et dans la chaloupe tout ce qu’ils purent contenir de provisions et de liqueurs ; on fit un chargement considérable de bois ; déjà la muraille de tribord était démolie jusqu’à sa ligne de flottaison. Enfin, le dernier jour fut un jour d’orgie ; on pilla, on saccagea, et ce fut au milieu de leur ivresse que Pen et deux ou trois autres mirent le feu au navire. Je me battis contre eux, je luttai ; on me renversa, on me frappa ; puis ces misérables, Shandon en tête, prirent par l’est et disparurent à mes regards ! Je restai seul ; que pouvais-je faire contre cet incendie qui gagnait le navire tout entier ? Le trou à feu était obstrué par la glace ; je n’avais pas une goutte d’eau.

Provisions were plentiful; the sick, excited by the hope of the return, were getting better. Preparations for departure were therefore begun; a sledge was built, suitable for transporting food, fuel and the boat; men had to get on with it. It took until February 15. I always hoped to see you arrive, captain, and yet I feared your presence; you would have obtained nothing from the crew, who would have rather massacred you than stay on board.

I couldn't get anything, even from the best! The departure was fixed for February 22. Shandon was impatient. They piled up on the sledge and in the launch all they could contain of provisions and liquors; a considerable load of wood was loaded; already the starboard wall was demolished to its waterline. Finally, the last day was a day of orgy; they plundered and ransacked, and it was in the midst of their intoxication that Pen and two or three others set fire to the ship. I fought against them, I struggled; I was knocked down, I was beaten; then these wretches, Shandon at the head, took the east and disappeared from view!

"Ils étaient pris aussi du mal de la blancheur ; cet éclat uniforme écœurait ; il enivrait, il donnait le vertige ; le sol semblait manquer et n’offrir aucun point fixe sur cette immense nappe blanche ; le sentiment éprouvé était celui du roulis, pendant lequel le pont du navire fuit sous le pied du marin ; les voyageurs ne pouvaient s’habituer à cet effet, et la continuité de cette sensation leur portait à la tête. La torpeur s’emparait de leurs membres, la somnolence de leur esprit, et souvent ils marchaient comme des hommes à peu près endormis ; alors un chaos, un heurt inattendu, une chute même, les tirait de cette inertie, qui les reprenait quelques instants plus tard.","They were also seized with the evil of whiteness; this uniform brilliance was sickening; he was intoxicating, he made you dizzy; the ground seemed to be missing and to offer no fixed point on this immense white tablecloth; the feeling experienced was that of rolling, during which the deck of the ship leaks under the sailor's foot; travelers could not get used to this effect, and the continuity of this sensation went to their heads.

Their limbs grew torpid, their minds grew dull, and often they walked like men half asleep; then a slip or a sudden fall would rouse them for a few moments from their sluggishness.","They also suffered from white sickness;* this uniform glare made them ill; it intoxicated, it made them dizzy; the ground seemed to disappear and the immense sheet have no fixed point; the feeling was the same as pitching and rolling, the deck missing under the sailor’s foot; the travellers could not get used to it and the constant sensation went to their heads.

"La montagne, en pleine éruption, vomissait une masse de pierres brûlantes et de quartiers de rocs incandescents ; elle semblait s’agiter sous des secousses réitérées comme une respiration de géant ; les masses projetées montaient dans les airs à une grande hauteur, au milieu des jets d’une flamme intense, et des coulées de lave se déroulaient sur ses flancs en torrents impétueux ; ici, des serpents embrasés se faufilaient entre les roches fumantes ; là, des cascades ardentes retombaient au milieu d’une vapeur pourpre, et plus bas, un fleuve de feu, formé de mille rivières ignées, se jetaient à la mer par une embouchure bouillonnante.","The mountain, in full eruption, vomited a mass of burning stones and sections of incandescent rock; it seemed to move under repeated shocks like the breathing of a giant; the projected masses rose in the air to a great height, in the midst of jets of intense flame, and lava flows rolled down its sides in impetuous torrents; here fiery serpents weaved between the smoking rocks; there, fiery cascades fell in the middle of a purple vapor, and lower down, a river of fire, formed of a thousand igneous rivers, threw itself into the sea by a boiling mouth.","The mountain, in full eruption, was hurling forth a mass of burning stones and melting rocks. It seemed to be rising and falling beneath the successive blasts as if it were breathing; the things which were cast out reached a great height in the air; amid the jets of flame, torrents of lava were flowing down the side of the mountain; here creeping between steaming rocks, there falling in cascades amid the purple vapor: and lower down a thousand streams united in one large river, which ran boiling into the sea.

"On discuta donc le parti à prendre dans ces circonstances. Devait-on retourner au navire, et recommencer cette expédition ? Mais comment se décider à perdre ces cent cinquante milles déjà franchis ?

Would we still find people determined to resume this race through the ice?,"They then began to discuss what should be done, whether they should return to the ship and start out again. But how could they make up their minds to lose the hundred and fifty miles they had already made? To return without fuel would have a depressing effect upon the spirits of the crew.

"Altamont interrogea le docteur sur la nature de cette substance extraordinaire, et celui-ci lui apprit que cette coloration provenait uniquement de la présence de corpuscules organiques ; longtemps les chimistes se demandèrent si ces corpuscules étaient d’une nature animale ou végétale ; mais ils reconnurent enfin qu’ils appartenaient à la famille des champignons microscopiques du genre « Uredo », que Baüer proposa d’appeler « Uredo nivalis ».","Altamont questioned the doctor on the nature of this extraordinary substance, and the latter informed him that this coloration came solely from the presence of organic corpuscles; For a long time chemists wondered if these corpuscles were of an animal or vegetable nature; but they finally recognized that they belonged to the family of microscopic fungi of the genus ""Uredo"", which Baüer proposed to call ""Uredo nivalis"".","Altamont asked the doctor about the nature of this extraordinary substance.

"Si les armes ne furent pas nombreuses à bord, ce qui pouvait rassurer les esprits timides, la soute aux poudres regorgeait, détail de nature à effrayer. L’unique canon du gaillard d’avant ne pouvait avoir la prétention d’absorber cet approvisionnement. Cela donnait à penser. II y avait également des scies gigantesques et des engins puissants, tels que leviers, masses de plomb, scies à main, haches énormes, etc., sans compter une recommandable quantité de blasting-cylinders[4] , dont l’explosion eût suffi à faire sauter la douane de Liverpool.

It was all strange, if not frightening, not to mention the rockets, signals, fireworks and beacons of a thousand kinds.","If the armament of the vessel was small enough to calm the timid souls, on the other hand, the magazine was filled with enough powder to inspire some uneasiness.

He was able to hide his despair; and as if the only open path were the one of his choice, he turned the Forward towards Franklin Sound.

"La côte formait dans l’est et dans l’ouest deux caps qui allaient se perdre en pente douce au milieu des vagues ; la mer brisait à leur extrémité, et une légère écume s’envolait par nappes blanches sur les ailes du vent, le sol de la Nouvelle-Amérique venait ainsi mourir à l’Océan polaire, sans convulsions, tranquille et légèrement incliné ; il s’arrondissait en baie très ouverte et formait une rade foraine délimitée par les deux promontoires.

"À la hauteur de la baie Baring se trouve un étroit chenal qui fait communiquer le canal Wellington avec le canal de la Reine. Là, les trains de glace se trouvèrent fort pressés. Hatteras fit de vains efforts pour franchir les passes du nord de l’île Hamilton ; le vent s’y opposait ; il fallait donc se glisser entre l’île Hamilton et l’île Cornwallis ; on perdit là cinq jours précieux en efforts inutiles. La température tendait à s’abaisser, et tomba même, le 19 juillet, à vingt-six degrés (-4° centigrades) ; elle se releva le jour suivant ; mais cette menace anticipée de l’hiver arctique devait engager Hatteras à ne pas attendre davantage. Le vent avait une tendance à se tenir dans l’ouest et s’opposait à la marche de son navire. Et cependant, il avait hâte de gagner le point où Stewart se trouva en présence d’une mer libre. Le 19, il résolut de s’avancer à tout prix dans le chenal ; le vent soufflait debout au brick, qui, avec son hélice, eût pu lutter contre ces violentes rafales chargées de neige, mais Hatteras devait avant tout ménager son combustible ; d’un autre côté, la passe était trop large pour permettre de haler sur le brick. Hatteras, sans tenir compte des fatigues de l’équipage, recourut à un moyen que les baleiniers emploient parfois dans des circonstances identiques. Il fit amener les embarcations à fleur d’eau, tout en les maintenant suspendues à leurs palans sur les flancs du navire ; ces embarcations étant solidement amarrées de l’avant et de l’arrière, les avirons furent armés sur tribord des unes et sur bâbord des autres ; les hommes, à tour de rôle, prirent place à leurs bancs de rameurs, et durent nager[46] vigoureusement de manière à pousser le brick contre le vent. Le Forward s’avança lentement dans le chenal ; on comprend ce que furent les fatigues provoquées par ce genre de travaux ; les murmures se firent entendre. Pendant quatre jours, on navigua de la sorte jusqu’au 23 juin, où l’on parvint à atteindre l’île Baring dans le canal de la Reine.","At Baring Bay is a narrow channel which connects Wellington Channel with Queen's Channel. There, the ice trains were in a great hurry. Hatteras made vain efforts to cross the passes north of Hamilton Island; the wind opposed it; it was therefore necessary to slip between Hamilton Island and Cornwallis Island; five precious days were lost in useless efforts. The temperature tended to drop, and even fell, on July 19, to twenty-six degrees (-4° Centigrade); she got up the next day; but this anticipated threat of the arctic winter should persuade Hatteras not to wait any longer. The wind had a tendency to stand in the west and opposed the course of his ship. And yet he was in a hurry to get to the point where Stewart found himself in the presence of open seas. On the 19th, he resolved to advance at all costs into the channel; the wind was blowing upright against the brig, which, with its propeller, could have resisted these violent gusts laden with snow, but Hatteras had above all to spare its fuel; on the other hand, the pass was too wide to allow hauling on the brig. Hatteras, ignoring the fatigues of the crew, resorted to a means which whalers sometimes employ in identical circumstances. He had the boats brought to the surface of the water, while keeping them suspended from their tackles on the sides of the ship; these boats being firmly moored fore and aft, the oars were armed on the starboard side of some and on the port side of others; the men, in turn, took their places at their rowing benches, and had to swim [46] vigorously so as to push the brig against the wind. The Forward advanced slowly into the channel; we can understand the fatigue caused by this kind of work; murmurs were heard. For four days, we sailed in this way until June 23, when we managed to reach Baring Island in the Queen's Channel.","At the end of Baring Bay is a narrow canal uniting Wellington Channel with Queen's Strait. There the ice had accumulated very closely. Hatteras made vain efforts to get through the passages to the north of Hamilton Island; the wind was unfavorable; hence it was necessary to go between Hamilton and Cornwallis Islands; five precious days were lost in vain attempts. The air grew colder, and, July 19th, fell as low as 26°; the next day was warmer, but this harbinger of the arctic winter warned Hatteras not to linger longer. The wind seemed to blow steadily from the west and delayed his progress. And yet he was in haste to reach the point whence Stewart saw an open sea. The 19th he resolved to enter the channel at any price; the wind blew dead against the brig, which, with her screw, could have made headway against the violent snow-squalls, but Hatteras had before all to be economical with the fuel; on the other hand, the channel was too broad to permit of the brig being towed. Hatteras, without taking into account the fatigue of his crew, made use of a device which whalers often employ under similar circumstances. He lowered the small boats to the surface of the water, not letting them free from their tackle; then they were made fast, fore and aft; oars were put out, to starboard on one side and to port on the other; the men sat on the thwarts and rowed vigorously, so as to propel the brig against the wind. Hatteras made use of a device which whalers employ. The Forward made slight headway; this method of working was very fatiguing; the men began to murmur. For four days they advanced in that way, until July 23d, when they reached Baring Island, in Queen's Channel.","Opposite Baring Bay is a narrow strait which connects Wellington Channel with Queen Channel. * There the trains of ice were packed close together. Hatteras made vain efforts to traverse the passes north of Hamilton Island; the wind was adverse; he had therefore to slip between Hamilton and Cornwallis Islands; five days were lost in useless efforts. The temperature was generally dropping, and even fell to twenty-six (−4°C) on 19 July; it went up the following day; but this early threat of the Arctic winter meant Hatteras should not wait any longer. The wind was tending to be westerly, opposing the progress of his ship. And yet he was in a hurry to reach the point where Stewart found the open sea. On the nineteenth he resolved to advance into the channel at all costs; the wind was blowing against the brig, which could have used its screw to fight these violent snow-laden squalls; but Hatteras absolutely had to save his fuel; also, the pass was too broad to allow the brig to be hauled. Without taking into account the crew’s tiredness, Hatteras resorted to a method sometimes employed by whalers in similar circumstances. He had the boats placed on the surface, while at the same time maintaining them suspended in their tackle at the sides of the ship; these boats were made fast fore and aft; the oars were outfitted to starboard or port; in rotation the men sat on the rowing benches and had to pull* vigorously in order to push the brig against the wind. The Forward advanced slowly into the channel; one can understand the fatigue produced by this sort of work; muttering could be heard.

"Le 31 août, le thermomètre marqua treize degrés (-10° centigrades).

À une époque moins avancée, il eût été possible peut-être de regagner par ce canal la mer de Baffin, mais alors il ne fallait pas y songer.

Earlier in the season it would have been possible to reach Baffin's Bay through this channel, but at this time it was impossible to think of it. This arm of the sea was completely filled with ice, and would not have offered a drop of open water to the prow of the Forward; for the next eight months their eyes would see nothing but boundless, motionless ice-fields.","On 31 August the thermometer read thirteen (−10°C). The end of the sailing season was near; the Forward left Exmouth Island to starboard, and three days later went past Table Island, in the centre of Belcher Channel.

"– Sans doute, reprit le docteur, l’intention de Franklin était de rejoindre la côte américaine ; mais les tempêtes l’assaillirent sur cette route funeste, et le 12 septembre 1846, les deux navires furent saisis par les glaces, à quelques milles d’ici, au nord-ouest du cap Félix ; ils furent entraînés encore jusqu’au nord-nord-ouest de la pointe Victory ; là-même, fit le docteur en désignant un point de la mer. Or, ajouta-t-il, les navires ne furent abandonnés que le 22 avril 1848. Que s’est-il donc passé pendant ces dix-neuf mois ? qu’ont-ils fait, ces malheureux ?

Now, he added, the ships were not abandoned until April 22, 1848. So what happened during those nineteen months? what did these wretches do?

"On partit à six heures du matin, par un beau temps ; après avoir suivi les contours de la baie, et dépassé le cap Washington, la route fut donnée droit au nord par Hatteras ; à sept heures, les voyageurs perdaient dans le sud le cône du phare et le Fort-Providence.","We left at six o'clock in the morning, in fine weather; after following the contours of the bay, and passing Cape Washington, the course was given due north by Hatteras; at seven o'clock the travelers lost the cone of the lighthouse and Fort Providence in the south.","They left at six o'clock in the morning; it was a very pleasant day.

"Hatteras vit bien qu’il ne pourrait plus obtenir de cet équipage mal disposé, et surtout épuisé de fatigue, la continuation des manœuvres précédentes.

Le docteur constata, contrairement à l’opinion de certains naturalistes, que ce changement ne provenait pas du grand abaissement de la température, car il avait lieu avant le mois d’octobre ; il ne résultait donc pas d’une cause physique, mais bien de la prévoyance providentielle, qui voulait mettre les animaux arctiques en mesure de braver la rigueur d’un hiver boréal.","Hares, foxes, wolves, stoats, bears were not lacking; a French, English, or Norwegian hunter would have had no right to complain; but these animals, very shy, did not allow themselves to be approached; it was difficult to distinguish them on these white plains from which they possessed the whiteness, because, before the great cold, they change color and put on their winter fur. The doctor noted, contrary to the opinion of certain naturalists, that this change did not come from the great lowering of the temperature, because it took place before the month of October; it therefore did not result from a physical cause, but rather from providential foresight, which wanted to put the Arctic animals in a position to brave the rigors of a northern winter.","Hares, foxes, wolves, ermines, and bears were plentiful; a French, English, or Norwegian hunter would have had no right to complain; but they were so shy that it was hard to approach them; besides, it was hard to distinguish them on the white plain, they being white themselves, for in winter they acquire that colored fur. In opposition to the opinions of some naturalists, the doctor held that this change was not due to the lowering of the temperature, since it took place before October; hence it was not due to any physical cause, but rather providential foresight, to secure these animals against the severity of an arctic winter.","Hares, foxes, wolves, ermines, and bears abounded; a French, British, or Norwegian huntsman would have had no reason to complain; but these shy animals nearly always ran away; also, it was difficult to make out the white animals against the white plains, for they change colour and put on their winter fur before the great colds. Contrary to what certain naturalists believe, the doctor observed that this change was not due to the fall in temperature, for it happened before October; so it was not physical reasons, but providential fore-thought, which enabled these Arctic animals to face the rigours of a northern winter."

"Le 29 mai, pour la première fois, le soleil ne se coucha pas ; son disque vint raser le bord de l’horizon, l’effleura à peine et se releva aussitôt ; on entrait dans la période des jours de vingt-quatre heures. Le lendemain, l’astre radieux parut entouré d’un halo magnifique, cercle lumineux brillant de toutes les couleurs du prisme ; l’apparition très fréquente de ces phénomènes attirait toujours l’attention du docteur ; il n’oubliait jamais d’en noter la date, les dimensions et l’apparence ; celui qu’il observa ce jour-là présentait, par sa forme elliptique, des dispositions encore peu connues. Bientôt toute la gent criarde des oiseaux reparut ; des bandes d’outardes, des troupes d’oies du Canada, venant des contrées lointaines de la Floride ou de l’Arkansas, filaient vers le nord avec une étonnante rapidité et ramenaient le printemps sous leurs ailes. Le docteur put en abattre quelques-unes, ainsi que trois ou quatre grues précoces et même une cigogne solitaire.","On May 29, for the first time, the sun did not set; its disc skimmed the edge of the horizon, barely touched it and immediately rose again; we were entering the period of twenty-four hour days.

Soon all the screaming flock of birds reappeared; flocks of Canada geese, flocks of Canada geese, coming from the distant lands of Florida or Arkansas, sped northward with astonishing rapidity and brought back the spring under their wings. The doctor was able to put down a few, as well as three or four precocious cranes and even a solitary stork.","On May 29th, for the first time, the sun did not set; it merely touched the horizon and then rose at once; the day was twenty-four hours long.

Or, le premier principe de l’entraînement est de supprimer la graisse chez le coureur comme chez le jockey, et cela, au moyen de purgatifs, de transpirations et d’exercices violents ; ces gentlemen savent qu’ils perdront tant par médecine, et ils arrivent à des résultats d’une justesse incroyable ; aussi, tel qui avant l’entraînement ne pouvait courir l’espace d’un mille sans perdre haleine, en fait facilement vingt-cinq après !

Now, the first principle of training is to suppress fat in the runner as in the jockey, and that, by means of purgatives, perspirations and violent exercises; these gentlemen know that they will lose so much by medicine, and they arrive at results of an incredible accuracy; also, someone who before training could not run the space of a mile without losing breath, easily does twenty-five afterwards!

"Alors, le docteur passa aux moyens de défense de la place. Sous sa direction, le plateau fut entouré d’une véritable fortification de glace qui le mit à l’abri de toute invasion ; sa hauteur faisait une escarpe naturelle, et, comme il n’avait ni rentrant ni saillant, il était également fort sur toutes les faces. Le docteur, en organisant ce système de défense, rappelait invinciblement à l’esprit le digne oncle Tobie de Sterne, dont il avait la douce bonté et l’égalité d’humeur. Il fallait le voir calculant la pente de son talus intérieur, l’inclinaison du terre-plein et la largeur de la banquette ; mais ce travail se faisait si facilement avec cette neige complaisante, que c’était un véritable plaisir, et l’aimable ingénieur put donner jusqu’à sept pieds d’épaisseur à sa muraille de glace ; d’ailleurs, le plateau dominant la baie, il n’eut à construire ni contre-escarpe, ni talus extérieur, ni glacis ; le parapet de neige, après avoir suivi les contours du plateau, prenait le mur du rocher en retour et venait se souder aux deux côtés de maison. Ces ouvrages de castramétation furent terminés vers le 15 avril. Le fort était au complet, et le docteur paraissait très fier de son œuvre.","Then the doctor passed to the means of defense of the place. Under his direction, the plateau was surrounded by a veritable fortification of ice which protected it from any invasion; its height made a natural escarpment, and, as it had neither re-entrant nor projecting, it was equally strong on all sides. The doctor, in organizing this system of defence, invincibly recalled to mind the worthy uncle Tobie de Sterne, whose gentle kindness and equanimity he had. You should have seen him calculating the slope of his interior embankment, the slope of the embankment and the width of the bench; but this work was done so easily with this complacent snow, that it was a real pleasure, and the amiable engineer was able to give up to seven feet in thickness to his wall of ice; moreover, the plateau dominating the bay, he had to build neither counter-scarp, nor exterior embankment, nor glacis; the parapet of snow, after having followed the contours of the plateau, took the wall of the rock in return and was welded to the two sides of the house. These works of castrametation were finished around the 15th of April. The fort was complete, and the doctor seemed very proud of his work.","Then the doctor passed to the means of defence of the place. Under his direction the plateau was surrounded by a real fortification of ice which secured it against every invasion; its height made a natural protection, and as there was no salient, it was equally strong on all sides. The doctor's system of defence recalled strongly the method of Sterne's Uncle Toby, whose gentleness and good-humor he also shared. He was a pleasant sight when he was calculating the inclination of the platform and the breadth of the causeway; but this task was so easy with the snow, that he enjoyed it, and he was able to make the wall seven feet thick; besides the plateau overlooking the bay, he had to build neither counterscarp nor glacis; the parapet of snow, after following the outlines of the plateau, joined the rock on the other side. The work of fortification was finished April 15th. The fort was completed, and the doctor seemed very proud of his work. The fort was completed.","Next, the doctor turned to the defence. Under his direction, the plateau was enclosed in a wall of ice, which protected it from any invasion; being so high up, it formed a natural scarp, and as it had neither recess nor projection, was equally strong in every direction. While organizing this system of defence, the doctor inevitably resembled Sterne’s good Uncle Toby,* whose gentle goodness and equanimity he shared. He had to be seen calculating the angle of the inside slope, the inclination of the lawn, and the size of the overhang; but this work was so easy with the obliging snow that it was a genuine pleasure, and the amiable engineer could make his ice fortifications seven feet thick; in any case, the plateau looked out on to the bay, and thus he didn’t have to build a counter-escarpment, external slope, or ramp; the two ends of the snow parapet followed the shape of the plateau as they left the rock wall and came to join the two sides of the house. * These works of castrametation were finished on about 15 April. The fort was complete, and the doctor appeared very proud of his work."

"Duk pouvait certainement demander une part dans leur éducation ; il leur avait donné des leçons de bonne compagnie et prêchait d’exemple ; en sa qualité d’Anglais, très pointilleux sur la question du « cant », il fut longtemps à se familiariser avec des chiens « qui ne lui avaient pas été présentés », et, dans le principe, il ne leur parlait pas ; mais, à force de partager les mêmes dangers, les mêmes privations, la même fortune, ces animaux de race différente frayèrent peu à peu ensemble.

"Or, il faut le dire, c’était bien la pensée du commandant ; il se laissait facilement aller à cette idée, qu’au dernier moment il recevrait ses instructions précises sur le but du voyage, et qu’il demeurerait chef à bord du Forward.

Ce fut à cet endroit même que sir Edward Belcher passa son premier hivernage sur le Pionnier et l’Assistance. C’est de ce point qu’il organisa ses excursions en traîneau et en bateau ; il découvrit l’île de la Table, les Cornouailles septentrionales, l’archipel Victoria et le canal Belcher. Parvenu au-delà du soixante-dix-huitième degré, il vit la côte s’incliner vers le sud-est. Elle semblait devoir se relier au détroit de Jones, dont l’entrée donne sur la baie de Baffin.

It was from this point that he organized his excursions by sleigh and boat; he discovered Table Island, North Cornwall, the Victoria Archipelago and the Belcher Channel. Having reached beyond the seventy-eighth degree, he saw the coast tilt towards the southeast. It seemed to connect to Jones Sound, the entrance to which opens into Baffin Bay.
