"Ce fut, durant quelques jours, dans sa cervelle, un grouillement de paradoxes, de subtilités, un vol de poils fendus en quatre, un écheveau de règles aussi compliquées que des articles de codes, prêtant à tous les sens, à tous les jeux de mots, aboutissant à une jurisprudence céleste des plus ténues, des plus baroques; puis le côté abstrait s'effaça, à son tour, et tout un côté plastique lui succéda, sous l'action des Gustave Moreau pendus aux murs.","There was, for a few days, in his brain, a swarm of paradoxes, of subtleties, a flight of hairs split into four, a tangle of rules as complicated as articles of code, lending to all the senses, to all the games of words, culminating in a celestial jurisprudence of the most tenuous, of the most baroque; then the abstract side faded, in its turn, and a whole plastic side succeeded it, under the action of Gustave Moreau hanging on the walls.","For several days in succession, his brain was a seething mass of paradoxes and sophisms, a tangle of split hairs, a maze of rules as complicated as the clauses of a law, open to every conceivable interpretation and every kind of quibble, and leading up to a system of celestial jurisprudence of positively baroque subtlety. Then these abstract obsessions left him, and a whole series of plastic impressions took their place, under the influence of the Gustave Moreau pictures hanging on the walls.","For several days his brain was a swarm of paradoxes, subtleties and hair-splittings, a skein of rules as complicated as the articles of the codes that involved the sense of everything, indulged in puns and ended in a most tenuous and singular celestial jurisprudence. The abstract side vanished, in its turn, and under the influence of the Gustave Moreau paintings of the wall, yielded to a concrete succession of pictures."
"Après la vente de ses biens, des Esseintes garda les deux vieux domestiques qui avaient soigné sa mère et rempli tout à la fois l'office de régisseurs et de concierges du château de Lourps, demeuré jusqu'à l'époque de sa mise en adjudication inhabité et vide.","After the sale of his property, Des Esseintes kept the two old servants who had cared for his mother and filled the office of managers and concierges of the Château de Lourps, which remained until the time of its auction. uninhabited and empty.","After the sale of his goods, Des Esseintes kept on the two old servants who had looked after his mother and who between them had acted as steward and concierge at the Château de Lourps while it waited, empty and untenanted, for a buyer.","After selling his effects, Des Esseintes retained the two old domestics who had tended his mother and filled the offices of steward and house porter at the Château de Lourps, which had remained deserted and uninhabited until its disposal. These servants he brought to Fontenay."
"Mais, en sus des frissons qu'elles apportaient, en sus aussi du terrible talent de cet homme, de l'extraordinaire vie qui animait ses personnages, l'on découvrait chez ses étonnants pullulements de foule, chez ses flots de peuple enlevés avec une dextérité de pointe rappelant celle de Callot, mais avec une puissance que n'eut jamais cet amusant gribouilleur, des reconstitutions curieuses de milieux et d'époques; l'architecture, les costumes, les moeurs au temps des Macchabées, à Rome, sous les persécutions des chrétiens, en Espagne, sous le règne de l'inquisition, en France, au moyen âge et à l'époque des Saint-Barthélemy et des Dragonnades, étaient observés avec un soin méticuleux, notés avec une science extrême.","But, in addition to the shivers they brought, in addition also to the terrible talent of this man, to the extraordinary life which animated his characters, one discovered in his astonishing swarming of crowds, in his waves of people carried away with advanced dexterity recalling that of Callot, but with a power never possessed by this amusing scribbler, curious reconstructions of backgrounds and periods; architecture, costumes, mores in the time of the Maccabees, in Rome, under the persecutions of Christians, in Spain, under the reign of the Inquisition, in France, in the Middle Ages and at the time of Saint-Barthélemy and Dragonnades, were observed with meticulous care, noted down with extreme science.","But over and above the shudders they provoked, over and above the frightening genius of the man and the extraordinary life he put into his figures, there were to be found in his astonishing crowd-scenes, in the hosts of people he sketched with a dexterity reminiscent of Callot but with a vigour that amusing scribbler never attained, remarkable reconstructions of other places and periods: buildings, costumes and manners in the days of the Maccabees, in Rome during the persecutions of the Christians, in Spain under the Inquisition, in France during the Middle Ages and at the time of the St Bartholomew massacres and the Dragonnades, were all observed with meticulous care and depicted with wonderful skill.","But in addition to the tremblings they occasioned, beyond the terrible skill of this man, the extraordinary life which animates his characters, one discovered, among his astonishing, swarming throngs—among his mobs of people delineated with a dexterity which recalled Callot, but which had a strength never possessed by that amusing dauber—curious reconstructions of bygone ages. The architecture, costumes and customs during the time of the Maccabeans, of Rome under the Christian persecutions, of Spain under the Inquisition, of France during the Middle Ages, at the time of Saint Bartholomew and the Dragonnades, were studied with a meticulous care and noted with scientific accuracy."
"Cette collection lui avait coûté de considérables sommes; il n'admettait pas, en effet, que les auteurs qu'il choyait fussent, dans sa bibliothèque, de même que dans celles des autres, gravés sur du papier de coton, avec les souliers à clous d'un Auvergnat.","This collection had cost him considerable sums; he did not allow, in fact, that the authors he pampered were, in his library, as well as in those of others, engraved on cotton paper, with the nailed shoes of an Auvergnat.","This collection had cost him considerable sums of money, for the truth was that he could not bear to have his favourite authors printed on rag-paper, as they were in other people’s libraries, with characters like hobnails in a peasant’s boots.2","This collection had cost him a considerable sum of money. He would not suffer, in his library, the books he loved to resemble other similar volumes, printed on cotton paper with the watermarks of Auvergne."
"Convaincu de l'impitoyable puissance des petites misères, plus désastreuses pour les tempéraments bien trempés que les grandes et, se basant sur ce fait que d'Aigurande ne possédait aucune fortune et que la dot de sa femme était à peu près nulle, il aperçut, dans ce simple souhait, une perspective infinie de ridicules maux.","Convinced of the pitiless power of small miseries, more disastrous for strong temperaments than great ones, and basing himself on the fact that d'Aigurande possessed no fortune and that his wife's dowry was almost nil, he perceived , in this simple wish, an infinite prospect of ridiculous evils.","Persuaded of the merciless power of petty vexations, which can have a more baneful effect on sanguine souls than the great tragedies of life, and taking account of the fact that D’Aigurande had no private means, while his wife’s dowry was practically non-existent, he saw in this innocent whim an endless source of ridiculous misfortunes.","Although he experienced no inclination for the state of grace, he felt a genuine sympathy for those souls immured in monasteries, persecuted by a vengeful society which can forgive neither the merited scorn with which it inspires them, nor the desire to expiate, to atone by long silences, for the ever growing shamelessness of its ridiculous or trifling gossipings."
"Il vécut ainsi, parfaitement heureux, sentant à peine le joug paternel des prêtres ; il continua ses études latines et françaises, à sa guise, et, encore que la théologie ne figurât point dans les programmes de ses classes, il compléta l'apprentissage de cette science qu'il avait commencée au château de Lourps, dans la bibliothèque léguée par son arrière-grand-oncle Dom Prosper, ancien prieur des chanoines réguliers de Saint-Ruf.","He lived thus, perfectly happy, hardly feeling the paternal yoke of the priests; he continued his Latin and French studies, as he pleased, and, although theology did not appear in the programs of his classes, he completed the learning of this science which he had begun at the Château de Lourps, in the library bequeathed by his great-great-uncle Dom Prosper, former prior of the regular canons of Saint-Ruf.","He therefore lived a perfectly contented life at school, scarcely aware of the priests’ fatherly control. He worked at his Latin and French books in his own way and in his own time; and although theology was not one of the subjects in the school syllabus, he finished the apprenticeship to this science which he had begun at the Château de Lourps, in the library left by his great-great-uncle Dom Prosper, a former Prior of the Canons Regular of Saint-Ruf.","Thus he lived in perfect contentment, scarcely feeling the parental yoke of the priests. He continued his Latin and French studies when the whim seized him and, although theology did not figure in his schedule, he finished his apprenticeship in this science, begun at the Château de Lourps, in the library bequeathed by his grand-uncle, Dom Prosper, the old prior of the regular canons of Saint-Ruf."
"Il s'était procuré, dans ces conditions, des livres uniques, adoptant des formats inusités qu'il faisait revêtir par Lortic, par Trautz-Bauzonnet, par Chambolle, par les successeurs de Capé, d'irréprochables reliures en soie antique, en peau de boeuf estampée, en peau de bouc du Cap, des reliures pleines, à compartiments et à mosaïques, doublées de tabis ou de moire, ecclésiastiquement ornées de fermoirs et de coins, parfois même émaillées par Gruel-Engelmann d'argent oxydé et d'émaux lucides.","Under these conditions, he had procured unique books, adopting unusual formats, which he had Lortic, Trautz-Bauzonnet, Chambolle and Capé's successors cover with impeccable bindings in antique silk, leather stamped cowhide, Cape goatskin, full, compartmented and mosaic bindings, lined with tabis or moire, ecclesiastically adorned with clasps and corners, sometimes even enamelled by Gruel-Engelmann with oxidized silver and lucid enamels.","In this way he had got together some unique volumes, always choosing unusual formats and having them clothed by Lortic, by Trautz-Bauzonnet, by Chambolle, by Capé’s successors, in irreproachable bindings of old silk, of embossed ox-hide, of Cape goat-skin – all full bindings, patterned and inlaid, lined with tabby or watered silk, adorned in ecclesiastic fashion with metal clasps and corners, sometimes even decorated by Gruel-Engelmann in oxidized silver and shining enamel.","Under these circumstances he had succeeded in procuring unique books, adopting obsolete formats which he had bound by Lortic, by Trautz-Bauzonnet or Chambolle, by the successors of Capé, in irreproachable covers of old silk, stamped cow hide, Cape goat skin, in full bindings with compartments and in mosaic designs, protected by tabby or moire watered silk, ecclesiastically ornamented with clasps and corners, and sometimes even enamelled by Gruel Engelmann with silver oxide and clear enamels."
"Enfin, peu à peu, les organes se restaurèrent; aidées par les pepsines, les véritables viandes furent digérées, les forces se rétablirent et des Esseintes put se tenir debout dans sa chambre et s'essayer à marcher, en s'appuyant sur une canne et en se soutenant aux coins des meubles; au lieu de se réjouir de ce succès, il oublia ses souffrances défuntes, s'irrita de la longueur de la convalescence, et reprocha au médecin de le traîner ainsi à petits pas. Des essais infructueux ralentirent, il est vrai, la cure; pas mieux que le quinquina, le fer, même mitigé par le laudanum, n'était accepte et l'on dut les remplacer par les arséniates, après quinze jours perdus en d'inutiles efforts, comme le constatait impatiemment des Esseintes.","Finally, little by little, the organs were restored; aided by the pepsins, the real meats were digested, their strength recovered, and Des Esseintes was able to stand up in his room and try his hand at walking, leaning on a cane and supporting himself at the corners of the furniture; instead of rejoicing in this success, he forgot his past sufferings, became irritated at the length of the convalescence, and reproached the doctor for thus dragging him along slowly. Fruitless attempts slowed down, it is true, the cure; no better than cinchona, iron, even mitigated by laudanum, was not accepted and they had to be replaced by arsenates, after a fortnight wasted in useless efforts, as Des Esseintes observed impatiently.","Eventually, little by little, the organs recovered, and with the help of pepsins ordinary food was digested. Des Esseintes’s strength returned and he was able to get up and hobble around his bedroom, leaning on a stick and holding on to the furniture. But instead of being pleased with his progress, he forgot all his past sufferings, fretted over the time his convalescence was taking and accused the doctor of spinning it out. It was true that a few unsuccessful experiments had slowed things down; iron proved no more acceptable than quinquina, even when it was mixed with laudanum, and these drugs had to be replaced by arseniates – this after a fortnight had been wasted in useless efforts, as Des Esseintes angrily pointed out.","Finally the organs were restored. Meats were digested with the aid of pepsines. Recovering strength, he was able to stand up and attempt to walk, leaning on a cane and supporting himself on the furniture. Instead of being thankful over his success, he forgot his past pains, grew irritated at the length of time needed for convalescence and reproached the doctor for not effecting a more rapid cure."
"Seul, parmi ces jeunes gens, des Esseintes encouragea ses résolutions dès qu'il eut appris que sa fiancée désirait loger au coin d'un nouveau boulevard, dans l'un de ces modernes appartements tournés en rotonde.","Alone among these young people, Des Esseintes encouraged his resolutions as soon as he learned that his fiancee wished to lodge at the corner of a new boulevard, in one of those modern apartments turned into a rotunda.","Des Esseintes had been the only one among all these young men to encourage him in his resolve, and this he did as soon as he learnt that his friend’s fiancée wanted to live on the corner of a newly constructed boulevard, in one of those modern flats built on a circular plan.","Although he experienced no inclination for the state of grace, he felt a genuine sympathy for those souls immured in monasteries, persecuted by a vengeful society which can forgive neither the merited scorn with which it inspires them, nor the desire to expiate, to atone by long silences, for the ever growing shamelessness of its ridiculous or trifling gossipings."
"Sur ses indications, le vieillard se mit à l'oeuvre, lui apportant, un à un, les livres qu'il examinait et dont il désignait la place.","On his instructions, the old man set to work, bringing him, one by one, the books he was examining and whose place he pointed out.","Following his instructions, the old man set to work, bringing him the books one by one so that he could examine each and say where it was to go.","Following his directions, the old man continued the task, bringing each book in turn to Des Esseintes who examined it and directed where it was to be placed."
"- Alors ce n'est pas pour ton compte que tu viens, ce soir, dit à des Esseintes madame Laure. Mais où diable as-tu levé ce bambin? reprit-elle, quand Auguste eut disparu, emmené par la belle juive.","""So it's not on your own account that you're coming this evening,"" Madame Laure said to Des Esseintes. But where the hell did you raise that toddler? she went on, when Auguste had disappeared, taken away by the beautiful Jewess.","‘So it’s not on your own account that you’ve come here tonight,’ said Madame Laure to Des Esseintes. ‘But where the devil did you get hold of that baby?’ she added, as Auguste disappeared with the handsome Jewess.","Although he experienced no inclination for the state of grace, he felt a genuine sympathy for those souls immured in monasteries, persecuted by a vengeful society which can forgive neither the merited scorn with which it inspires them, nor the desire to expiate, to atone by long silences, for the ever growing shamelessness of its ridiculous or trifling gossipings."
"De cette famille naguère si nombreuse qu'elle occupait presque tous les territoires de l'Île-de-France et de la Brie, un seul rejeton vivait, le duc Jean, un grêle jeune homme de trente ans, anémique et nerveux, aux joues caves, aux yeux d'un bleu froid d'acier, au nez éventé et pourtant droit, aux mains sèches et fluettes.","Of this family once so large that it occupied almost all the territories of the Ile-de-France and Brie, only one offspring lived, the Duke Jean, a slender young man of thirty, anemic and nervous, with cheeks cellars, with eyes of a cold steel blue, with a stale and yet straight nose, with dry and slender hands.","Now, of this family which had once been so large that it occupied nearly every domain in the Ile de France and La Brie, only one descendant was still living: the Duc Jean des Esseintes, a frail young man of thirty who was anaemic and highly strung, with hollow cheeks, cold eyes of steely blue, a nose which was turned up but straight and thin, papery hands.","There was only one living scion of this family which had once been so numerous that it had occupied all the territories of the Ile-de-France and La Brie. The Duc Jean was a slender, nervous young man of thirty, with hollow cheeks, cold, steel-blue eyes, a straight, thin nose and delicate hands."
"Afin de jouir d'une oeuvre qui joignît, suivant ses voeux, à un style incisif, une analyse pénétrante et féline, il lui fallait arriver au maître de l'Induction, à ce profond et étrange Edgar Poe, pour lequel, depuis le temps qu'il le relisait sa dilection n'avait pu déchoir.","In order to enjoy a work that joined, according to his wishes, to an incisive style, a penetrating and feline analysis, he had to arrive at the master of Induction, at that profound and strange Edgar Poe, for whom, for the time that he reread it his love had not been able to decline.","In order to enjoy a literature that united, just as he wished, an incisive style and a subtle, feline skill in analysis, he had to wait till he reached that master of induction, the wise and wonderful Edgar Allan Poe, for whom his admiration had not suffered in the least from rereading his work.","To enjoy a work which should combine, according to his wishes, incisive style with penetrating and feline analysis, he had to go to the master of induction, the profound and strange Edgar Allen Poe, for whom, since the time when he re-read him, his preference had never wavered."

Ce rez-de-chaussée était ainsi distribué:,This ground floor was distributed as follows:,"This ground floor was divided as follows: a dressing-room, communicating with the bedroom, occupied one corner of the building; from the bedroom you went into the library, and from the library into the dining-room, which occupied another corner.",It was thus arranged:
"Toutes ces toiles assaillaient en foule sa mémoire. Le commis étonné par ce client qui s'oubliait devant une table, lui demanda sur lequel de ces guides il fixait son choix. Des Esseintes demeura ébaubi, puis il s'excusa, fit l'emplette d'un Baedeker et franchit la porte. L'humidité le glaça; le vent soufflait de côté, cinglait les arcades de ses fouets de pluie. - Allez là, fit-il, au cocher, en désignant du doigt au bout d'une galerie, un magasin qui formait l'angle de la rue de Rivoli et de la rue de Castiglione et ressemblait avec ses carreaux blanchâtres, éclairés en dedans, à une gigantesque veilleuse, brûlant dans le malaise de ce brouillard, dans la misère de ce temps malade.","All these canvases assailed his memory in droves. The clerk, astonished by this customer who forgot himself in front of a table, asked him on which of these guides he fixed his choice. Des Esseintes was dumbfounded, then he excused himself, bought a Baedeker and walked out the door. The humidity froze him; the wind blew sideways, lashing the arches with its whips of rain. ""Go there,"" he said to the coachman, pointing with his finger at the end of a gallery, to a shop which formed the angle of the rue de Rivoli and the rue de Castiglione and resembled, with its whitish squares, lit within , to a gigantic night light, burning in the malaise of this fog, in the misery of this sick weather.","All these paintings were crowding into his memory when the shop-assistant, surprised to see a customer sitting daydreaming at a table, asked him which of the guidebooks he had chosen. For a moment Des Esseintes could not remember where he was, but then, with a word of apology for his absentmindedness, he bought a Baedeker and left the shop. Outside, he found it bitterly cold and wet, for the wind was blowing across the street and lashing the arcades with rain. ‘Drive over there,’ he told the cabby, pointing to a shop at the very end of the gallery, on the corner of the Rue de Rivoli and the Rue Castiglione, which with its brightly lit windows looked like a gigantic night-light burning cheerfully in the pestilential fog.","These canvasses thronged through his memory. The clerk, astonished by this client who was so lost to the world, asked him which of the guides he would take. Des Esseintes remained dumbfounded, then excused himself, bought a Baedeker and departed. The dampness froze him to the spot; the wind blew from the side, lashing the arcades with whips of rain. “Proceed to that place,” he said to the driver, pointing with his finger to the end of a passage where a store formed the angle of the rue de Rivoli and the rue Castiglione and, with its whitish panes of glass illumed from within, resembled a vast night lamp burning through the wretchedness of this mist, in the misery of this crazy weather."
"La honte l'avait emporté sur la peur; il avait été introduit dans une salle à manger; une autre porte avait claqué, donnant passage à un terrible grenadier, vêtu d'une redingote et d'un pantalon noirs, en bois; des Esseintes le suivit dans une autre pièce.","Shame had won out over fear; he had been ushered into a dining room; another door had slammed, giving way to a terrible grenadier, dressed in a black coat and trousers, made of wood; Des Esseintes followed him into another room.","Shame overcame fear, and he let her show him into what appeared to be a dining-room. Another door banged open, admitting a great, strapping fellow dressed in a frock-coat and trousers that seemed carved in wood. Des Esseintes followed him into an inner sanctum.",His feeling of shame quickly changed to fear. He was ushered into a dining room. Another door creaked and in entered a terrible grenadier dressed in a frock-coat and black trousers. Des Esseintes followed him to another room.
"Cette chambre, il l'avait jadis comprise dans son logement de Paris, avec le grand lit blanc laqué qui est un piment de plus, une dépravation de vieux passionné, hennissant devant la fausse chasteté, devant l'hypocrite pudeur des tendrons de Greuze, devant l'artificielle candeur d'un lit polisson, sentant l'enfant et la jeune fille.","This room, he had once understood it in his lodgings in Paris, with the large white lacquered bed which is one more spice, the depravity of an old enthusiast, whinnying before the false chastity, before the hypocritical modesty of the tendons of Greuze, in front of the artificial candor of a naughty bed, smelling of the child and the young girl.","In his Paris house he had had a bedroom decorated in just this style, and furnished with the great white lacquered bed which provides that added titillation, that final touch of depravity so precious to the experienced voluptuary, excited by the spurious chastity and hypocritical modesty of the Greuze figures, by the pretended purity of a bed of vice apparently designed for innocent children and young virgins.","He had once had such a room in Paris, with a lofty, white, lacquered bed which is one stimulant the more, a source of depravity to old roues, leering at the false chastity and hypocritical modesty of Greuze's tender virgins, at the deceptive candor of a bed evocative of babes and chaste maidens."
"Et toujours lorsqu'elles lui revenaient aux lèvres, ces exquises et funèbres plaintes évoquaient pour lui un site de banlieue, un site avare, muet, où, sans bruit, au loin, des files de gens, harassés par la vie, se perdaient, courbés en deux, dans le crépuscule, alors qu'abreuvé d'amertumes, gorgé de dégoût, il se sentait, dans la nature éplorée, seul, tout seul, terrassé par une indicible mélancolie, par une opiniâtre détresse, dont la mystérieuse intensité excluait toute consolation, toute pitié, tout repos. Pareil à un glas de mort, ce chant désespéré le hantait, maintenant qu'il était couché, anéanti par la fièvre et agité par une anxiété d'autant plus inapaisable qu'il n'en discernait plus la cause. Il finissait par s'abandonner à la dérive, culbuté par le torrent d'angoisses que versait cette musique tout d'un coup endiguée, pour une minute, par le chant des psaumes qui s'élevait, sur un ton lent et bas, dans sa tête dont les tempes meurtries lui semblaient frappées par des battants de cloches.","And always when they returned to his lips, these exquisite and funereal complaints evoked for him a suburban site, a miserly, silent site, where, noiselessly, in the distance, lines of people, harassed by life, were lost, bent double, in the twilight, while steeped in bitterness, gorged with disgust, he felt himself, in the tearful nature, alone, all alone, overwhelmed by an unspeakable melancholy, by an obstinate distress, the mysterious intensity of which excluded all consolation, all pity, all rest. Like a death knell, this despairing song haunted him, now that he was in bed, crushed by fever and agitated by an anxiety all the more insatiable because he no longer discerned its cause. He ended up abandoning himself to the drift, overthrown by the torrent of anguish poured out by this music, suddenly stemmed, for a minute, by the chanting of the psalms which rose, in a slow and low tone, in his head, the bruised temples of which seemed to him to have been struck by the clappers of bells.","Every time they came back to his lips, these exquisite, funereal laments called to mind a suburban scene, a shabby, silent piece of waste land and in the distance, lines of men and women, harassed by the cares of life, shuffling away, bent double, into the twilight, while he himself, steeped in bitterness and filled with disgust, felt alone in the midst of tearful Nature, all alone, overcome by an unspeakable melancholy, by an obstinate distress, the mysterious intensity of which precluded any prospect of consolation, of pity, of repose. Like the sound of a passing-bell, these mournful melodies haunted him now that he lay in bed, exhausted by fever and tormented by an anxiety that was all the more irresistible in that he could no longer discover its cause. He finally abandoned himself to the current of his emotions, swept away by the torrent of anguish let loose by this music – a torrent that was suddenly stemmed for a moment by the sound of the psalms echoing slowly and softly in his head, whose aching temples felt as though they were being beaten by the clappers of tolling bells.","And always, when these exquisite, sad plaints returned to his lips, there was evoked for him a suburban, flinty and gloomy site where a succession of silent bent persons, harassed by life, filed past into the twilight, while, steeped in bitterness and overflowing with disgust, he felt himself solitary in this dejected landscape, struck by an inexpressibly melancholy and stubborn distress whose mysterious intensity excluded all consolation, pity and repose. Like a funeral-knell, this despairing chant haunted him, now that he was in bed, prostrated by fever and agitated by an anxiety so much the more inappeasable for the fact that he could not discover its cause. He ended by abandoning himself to the torrent of anguishes suddenly dammed by the chant of psalms slowly rising in his tortured head."
"Il se rappela le joug paternel qui s'accommodait mal des punitions, se refusait à infliger des cinq cents et des mille vers, se contentait de faire ""réparer"", tandis que les autres s'amusaient, la leçon pas sue, recourait plus souvent encore à la simple réprimande, entourait l'enfant d'une surveillance active mais douce, cherchant à lui être agréable, consentant à des promenades où bon lui semblait, le mercredi, saisissant l'occasion de toutes les petites fêtes non carillonnées de l'église, pour ajouter à l'ordinaire des repas des gâteaux et du vin, pour le régaler de parties de campagne; un joug paternel qui consistait à ne pas abrutir l'élève, à discuter avec lui, à le traiter déjà en homme, tout en lui conservant le dorlotement d'un bambin gâté.","He remembered the paternal yoke which did not adapt well to punishments, refused to inflict five hundred and a thousand verses, contented itself with having ""repaired"", while the others had fun, the lesson not known, resorted more often simple reprimand, surrounded the child with an active but gentle surveillance, seeking to please him, agreeing to walks where he liked on Wednesdays, seizing the opportunity of all the little unchilled parties of the church, to add cakes and wine to the ordinary meals, to regale him at country parties; a paternal yoke which consisted in not stupefying the pupil, in discussing with him, in already treating him as a man, while preserving for him the pampering of a spoiled toddler.","He recalled that paternal discipline which deprecated any form of punishment, declined to inflict impositions of five hundred or a thousand lines, was content with having unsatisfactory work done over again while the others were at recreation, resorted more often than not to a mere reprimand and kept the child under active but affectionate surveillance, forever trying to please him, agreeing to whatever walks he suggested on Wednesday afternoons, seizing the opportunity afforded by all the minor feast-days of the Church to add cakes and wine to the ordinary bill of fare or to organize a picnic in the country – a discipline which consisted of reasoning with the pupil instead of brutalizing him, already treating him like a grown man yet still coddling him like a spoilt child.","He recalled the easy yoke of the monks who declined to administer punishment by inflicting the committment of five hundred or a thousand lines while the others were at play, being satisfied with making those delinquents prepare the lesson that had not been mastered, and most often simply having recourse to a gentle admonition. They surrounded the children with an active but gentle watch, seeking to please them, consenting to whatever expeditions they wished to take on Tuesdays, taking the occasion of every minor holiday not formally observed by the Church to add cakes and wine to the ordinary fare, and to entertain them with picnics."
"Le choix des pierres l'arrêta; le diamant est devenu singulièrement commun depuis que tous les commerçants en portent au petit doigt; les émeraudes et les rubis de l'Orient sont moins avilis, lancent de rutilantes flammes, mais ils rappellent par trop ces yeux verts et rouges de certains omnibus qui arborent des fanaux de ces deux couleurs, le long des tempes; quant aux topazes brûlées ou crues, ce sont des pierres à bon marché, chères à la petite bourgeoisie qui veut serrer des écrins dans une armoire à glace; d'un autre côté, bien que l'église ait conservé à l'améthyste un caractère sacerdotal, tout à la fois onctueux et grave, cette pierre s'est, elle aussi, galvaudée aux oreilles sanguines et aux mains tubuleuses des bouchères qui veulent, pour un prix modique, se parer de vrais et pesants bijoux; seul, parmi ces pierres, le saphir a gardé des feux inviolés par la sottise industrielle et pécuniaire. Ses étincelles grésillant sur une eau limpide et froide, ont, en quelque sorte, garanti de toute souillure sa noblesse discrète et hautaine. Malheureusement, aux lumières, ses flammes fraîches ne crépitent plus; l'eau bleue rentre en elle-même, semble s'endormir pour ne se réveiller, en pétillant, qu'au point du jour.","The choice of stones stopped him; the diamond has become singularly common since all merchants wear them on the little finger; the emeralds and rubies of the Orient are less degraded, shoot out gleaming flames, but they recall too much those green and red eyes of certain omnibuses which display lanterns of these two colors along the temples; as for burnt or raw topazes, these are cheap stones, dear to the petty bourgeoisie who want to squeeze boxes into a mirrored wardrobe; on the other hand, although the church has retained a sacerdotal character for amethyst, both unctuous and grave, this stone has also become tarnished in the bloody ears and tubular hands of butchers who want to , for a modest price, adorn yourself with real and heavy jewelry; alone, among these stones, the sapphire has kept fires inviolate by industrial and pecuniary stupidity. Its sparks sizzling on clear, cold water have, in a way, protected its discreet and haughty nobility from all stains. Unfortunately, in the lights, its cool flames no longer crackle; the blue water returns to itself, seems to fall asleep only to wake up, sparkling, only at daybreak.","The diamond, he told himself, has become terribly vulgar now that every businessman wears one on his little finger; Oriental emeralds and rubies are not so degraded and they dart bright tongues of fire, but they are too reminiscent of the green and red eyes of certain Paris buses fitted with headlamps in the selfsame colours ; as for topazes, whether pink or yellow, they are cheap stones, dear to people of the small shopkeeper class who long to have a few jewel-cases to lock up in their mirror wardrobes. Similarly, although the Church has helped the amethyst to retain something of a sacerdotal character, at once unctuous and solemn, this stone too has been debased by use in the red ears and on the tubulous fingers of butchers’ wives whose ambition it is to deck themselves out at little cost with genuine, heavy jewels. Alone among these stones, the sapphire has kept its fires inviolate, unsullied by contact with commercial and financial stupidity. The glittering sparks playing over its cold, limpid water have as it were protected its discreet and haughty nobility against any defilement. But unfortunately in artificial light its bright flames lose their brilliance; the blue water sinks low and seems to go to sleep, to wake and sparkle again only at daybreak.","The choice of stones made him pause. The diamond has become notoriously common since every tradesman has taken to wearing it on his little finger. The oriental emeralds and rubies are less vulgarized and cast brilliant, rutilant flames, but they remind one of the green and red antennæ of certain omnibuses which carry signal lights of these colors. As for topazes, whether sparkling or dim, they are cheap stones, precious only to women of the middle class who like to have jewel cases on their dressing-tables. And then, although the Church has preserved for the amethyst a sacerdotal character which is at once unctuous and solemn, this stone, too, is abused on the blood-red ears and veined hands of butchers' wives who love to adorn themselves inexpensively with real and heavy jewels. Only the sapphire, among all these stones, has kept its fires undefiled by any taint of commercialism. Its sparks, crackling in its limpid, cold depths have in some way protected its shy and proud nobility from pollution. Unfortunately, its fresh fire does not sparkle in artificial light: the blue retreats and seems to fall asleep, only awakening to shine at daybreak."
"Chez Flaubert, c'étaient des tableaux solennels et immenses, des pompes grandioses dans le cadre barbare et splendide desquels gravitaient des créatures palpitantes et délicates, mystérieuses et hautaines, des femmes pourvues, dans la perfection de leur beauté, d'âmes en souffrance, au fond desquelles il discernait d'affreux détraquements, de folles aspirations, désolées qu'elles étaient déjà par la menaçante médiocrité des plaisirs qui pouvaient naître.","In Flaubert, there were solemn and immense pictures, grandiose pomps in the barbaric and splendid setting of which gravitated palpitating and delicate creatures, mysterious and haughty, women endowed, in the perfection of their beauty, with souls in suffering, at the bottom of which he discerned frightful derangements, mad aspirations, desolate as they were already by the menacing mediocrity of the pleasures which could be born.","In Flaubert’s case, there was a series of vast, imposing scenes, grandiose pageantries of barbaric splendour in which there participated creatures delicate and sensitive, mysterious and proud, women cursed, in all the perfection of their beauty, with suffering souls, in the depths of which he discerned atrocious delusions, insane aspirations, born of the disgust they already felt for the dreadful mediocrity of the pleasures awaiting them.","In Flaubert this nostalgia is expressed in solemn and majestic pictures of magnificent splendors, in whose gorgeous, barbaric frames move palpitating and delicate creatures, mysterious and haughty—women gifted, in the perfection of their beauty, with souls capable of suffering and in whose depths he discerned frightful derangements, mad aspirations, grieved as they were by the haunting premonition of the dissillusionments their follies held in store."
"Ne pouvant s'harmoniser qu'à de rares intervalles avec le milieu où il évolue; ne découvrant plus dans l'examen de ce milieu et des créatures qui le subissent, des jouissances d'observation et d'analyse suffisantes à le distraire, il sent sourdre et éclore en lui de particuliers phénomènes. De confus désirs de migration se lèvent qui se débrouillent dans la réflexion et dans l'étude. Les instincts, les sensations, les penchants légués par l'hérédité se réveillent, se déterminent, s'imposent avec une impérieuse assurance. Il se rappelle des souvenirs d'êtres et de choses qu'il n'a pas personnellement connus, et il vient un moment où il s'évade violemment du pénitencier de son siècle et rôde, en toute liberté, dans une autre époque avec laquelle, par une dernière illusion, il lui semble qu'il eût été mieux en accord.","Only being able to harmonize at rare intervals with the environment in which it evolves; no longer discovering in the examination of this environment and of the creatures which undergo it, enjoyments of observation and analysis sufficient to distract him, he feels particular phenomena springing up and hatching within him. Confused desires for migration arise which unravel in reflection and study. The instincts, the sensations, the inclinations bequeathed by heredity awaken, determine themselves, impose themselves with an imperious assurance. He recalls memories of beings and things that he has not known personally, and there comes a time when he violently escapes from the penitentiary of his century and roams, in complete freedom, in another era with which , by a last illusion, it seems to him that he would have been in better agreement.","Unable to attune himself, except at rare intervals, to his environment, and no longer finding in the examination of that environment and the creatures who endure it sufficient pleasures of observation and analysis to divert him, he is aware of the birth and development in himself of unusual phenomena. Vague migratory longings spring up which find fulfilment in reflection and study. Instincts, sensations, inclinations bequeathed to him by heredity awake, take shape and assert themselves with imperious authority. He recalls memories of people and things he has never known personally, and there comes a time when he bursts out of the prison of his century and roams about at liberty in another period, with which, as a crowning illusion, he imagines he would have been more in accord.","Finding himself unable to harmonize, save at rare intervals, with the environment in which he lives and not discovering sufficient distraction in the pleasures of observation and analysis, in the examination of the environment and its people, he feels in himself the dawning of strange ideas. Confused desires for other lands awake and are clarified by reflection and study. Instincts, sensations and thoughts bequeathed by heredity, awake, grow fixed, assert themselves with an imperious assurance. He recalls memories of beings and things he has never really known and a time comes when he escapes from the penitentiary of his age and roves, in full liberty, into another epoch with which, through a last illusion, he seems more in harmony."
"Aussi des Esseintes pensait-il que, parmi cette tourbe de mélomanes qui s'extasiait, le dimanche, sur les banquettes, vingt à peine connaissaient la partition qu'on massacrait, quand les ouvreuses consentaient à se taire pour permettre d'écouter l'orchestre.","Des Esseintes also thought that, among this mob of music lovers who went into ecstasies on the benches on Sundays, barely twenty knew the score that was being massacred, when the usherettes consented to be silent to allow them to listen to the orchestra.","Des Esseintes was therefore convinced that of the mob of melomaniacs who went into ecstasies every Sunday on the benches of the Cirque d’Hiver, barely twenty could tell what the orchestra was murdering, even when the attendants were kind enough to stop chattering and give it a chance of being heard.","That was why he felt that, among the vulgar herd of melomaniacs enthusing each Sunday on benches, scarcely any knew the score that was being massacred, when the ushers consented to be silent and permit the orchestra to be heard."
"Ce désenchantement lui revenait; il consulta de nouveau sa montre: dix minutes le séparaient encore de l'heure du train. Il est grand temps de demander l'addition et de partir, se dit-il. Il se sentait une lourdeur d'estomac et une pesanteur, par tout le corps, extrêmes. Voyons, fit-il, pour se verser du courage, buvons le coup de l'étrier; et il remplit un verre de brandy, tout en réclamant sa note. Un individu, en habit noir, une serviette sur le bras, une espèce de majordome au crâne pointu et chauve, à la barbe grisonnante et dure, sans moustaches, s'avança, un crayon derrière l'oreille, se posta, une jambe en avant, comme un chanteur, tira de sa poche un calepin, et, sans regarder son papier, les yeux fixés sur le plafond, près d'un lustre, inscrivit et compta la dépense. Voilà, dit-il, en arrachant la feuille de son calepin, et il la remit à des Esseintes qui le considérait curieusement, ainsi qu'un animal rare. Quel surprenant John Bull, pensait-il, en contemplant ce flegmatique personnage à qui sa bouche rasée donnait aussi la vague apparence d'un timonier de la marine américaine.","This disenchantment returned to him; he looked at his watch again: ten minutes still separated him from the time of the train. It's high time to ask for the bill and leave, he told himself. He felt heaviness in his stomach and an extreme heaviness all over his body. Come, he said, to shed courage, let's drink the stirrup shot; and he fills a glass of brandy, asking for his bill. An individual, in a black suit, a briefcase over his arm, a sort of butler with a pointed, bald head, a grizzled, hard beard, without mustaches, advanced, a pencil behind his ear, posted himself, one leg in before, like a singer, took a notebook from his pocket, and, without looking at his paper, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, near a chandelier, wrote down and counted the expense. There you are, he said, tearing the sheet from his notebook and handing it to Des Esseintes, who looked at him curiously, like a rare animal. What a surprising John Bull, he thought, contemplating this phlegmatic character whose shaven mouth also gave the vague appearance of an American Navy helmsman.","Still thinking of this past disappointment, he once more consulted his watch: there were only ten minutes now before his train left. ‘It’s high time to ask for my bill and go,’ he told himself. But the food he had eaten was lying heavy on his stomach, and his whole body felt incapable of movement. ‘Come now,’ he muttered, trying to screw up his courage. ‘ Drink the stirrup-cup, and then you must be off.’ He poured himself a brandy, and at the same time called for his bill. This was the signal for a black-coated individual to come up with a napkin over one arm and a pencil behind his ear – a sort of majordomo with a bald, eggshaped head, a rough beard shot with grey and a clean-shaven upper lip. He took up a concert-singer’s pose, one leg thrown forward, drew a note-book from his pocket, and fixing his gaze on a spot close to one of the hanging chandeliers, he made out the bill without even looking at what he was writing. ‘There you are, sir,’ he said, tearing a leaf from his pad and handing it to Des Esseintes, who was examining him with unconcealed curiosity, as if he were some rare animal. What an extraordinary creature, he thought, as he surveyed this phlegmatic Englishman, whose hairless lips reminded him, oddly enough, of an American sailor.","The memory of that disenchantment returned to him. Once more he glanced at his watch: ten minutes still separated him from the train's departure. “It is about time to ask for the bill and leave,” he told himself. He felt an extreme heaviness in his stomach and through his body. “Come!” he addressed himself, “let us drink and screw up our courage.” He filled a glass of brandy, while asking for the reckoning. An individual in black suit and with a napkin under one arm, a sort of majordomo with a bald and sharp head, a greying beard without moustaches, came forward. A pencil rested behind his ear and he assumed an attitude like a singer, one foot in front of the other; he drew a note book from his pocket, and without glancing at his paper, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, near a chandelier, wrote while counting. “There you are!” he said, tearing the sheet from his note book and giving it to Des Esseintes who looked at him with curiosity, as though he were a rare animal. What a surprising John Bull, he thought, contemplating this phlegmatic person who had, because of his shaved mouth, the appearance of a wheelsman of an American ship."
"Puis, il parcourut toutes les autres séries de ses eaux-fortes et de ses aquatintes, ses Proverbes d'une horreur si macabre, ses sujets de guerre d'une rage si féroce, sa planche du Garrot enfin, dont il choyait une merveilleuse épreuve d'essai, imprimée sur papier épais, non collé, aux visibles pontuseaux traversant la pâte.","Then he went through all the other series of his etchings and aquatints, his Proverbs of such macabre horror, his subjects of war of such ferocious rage, his plate of the Garrot finally, of which he pampered a marvelous proof. test, printed on thick paper, not glued, with visible bridges crossing the paste.","Next, he went through all the other series of Goya’s etchings and aquatints, his macabre Proverbs, his ferocious war-scenes, and finally his Garrotting, a plate of which he possessed a magnificent trial proof printed on thick, unsized paper, with the wire-marks clearly visible.","Then he examined his other series of etchings and aquatints, his Proverbs with their macabre horror, his war subjects with their wild rage, finally his plate of the Garot, of which he cherished a marvelous trial proof, printed on heavy water-marked paper, unmounted."
"La pluie continuait à tomber; il l'entendait crépiter sur les vitres qui plafonnaient le fond de la pièce et dégouliner en cascades dans les gargouilles; personne ne bougeait dans la salle; tous se dorlotaient, ainsi que lui, au sec, devant des petits verres.","The rain continued to fall; he could hear it crackling on the panes which capped the back of the room and dripping in cascades in the gargoyles; no one moved in the room; all pampered themselves, like him, in the dry, in front of small glasses.","Outside, the rain was still falling steadily; he could hear it pattering on the glass skylight at the far end of the room and cascading into the water-spouts. Inside, no one stirred; all were dozing like himself over their liqueur glasses, pleasantly conscious that they were in the dry.",The rain continued to fall. He heard it patter on the panes which formed a ceiling at the end of the room; it fell in cascades down the spouts. No one was stirring in the room.
"Bien qu'il eût sacrifié tout le premier et unique étage de sa maison qu'il n'habitait personnellement pas, le rez-de-chaussée avait à lui seul nécessité des séries nombreuses de cadres pour habiller les murs.","Although he had sacrificed the entire first and only floor of his house, which he personally did not live in, the ground floor alone required numerous series of frames to dress the walls.","True, none were needed for the first and only upper storey of his house, since he had given it over to his servants and did not use any of its rooms; but the ground floor by itself demanded a good many to cover its bare walls.","Although he had surrendered to his servants the second story of his house, which he himself never used at all, the ground floor had required a number of pictures to fit the walls."
"Décidément la couleur tête-de-nègre, le ton de Sienne crue de cette carapace salissait les reflets du tapis sans les activer; les lueurs dominantes de l'argent étincelaient maintenant à peine, rampant avec les tons froids du zinc écorché, sur les bords de ce test dur et terne.","Definitely the blackhead color, the raw sienna tone of this carapace soiled the reflections of the carpet without activating them; the dominant gleams of silver barely sparkled now, crawling with the cold tones of scratched zinc, around the edges of this hard, dull test.","Alas, there could be no doubt about it: the negro-brown tint, the raw Sienna hue of the shell, dimmed the sheen of the carpet instead of bringing out its colours; the predominating gleams of silver had now lost nearly all their sparkle and matched the cold tones of scraped zinc along the edges of this hard, lustreless carapace.","Decidedly, the Ethiopic black, the harsh Sienna tone of this shell dulled the rug's reflections without adding to it. The dominant silver gleams in it barely sparkled, crawling with lack-lustre tones of dead zinc against the edges of the hard, tarnished shell."
"Les marmots se battaient maintenant. Ils s'arrachaient des lambeaux de pain qu'ils s'enfonçaient, dans les joues, en se suçant les doigts. Des coups de pied et des coups de poing pleuvaient et les plus faibles, foulés par terre, ruaient, et pleuraient, le derrière raboté par les caillasses.","The brats were fighting now. They tore off shreds of bread which they stuck into their cheeks, sucking their fingers. Kicks and punches rained down and the weakest, trodden on the ground, kicked and cried, their behinds shattered by the stones.","The lads were fighting now, snatching bits of bread from each other’s hands, ramming them into their mouths and licking their fingers afterwards. Kicks and blows fell thick and fast, and the weaker boys were knocked to the ground, where they lay thrashing about and crying as the broken stones dug into their bottoms.","The little chaps were fighting with one another. They struggled for bits of bread which they shoved into their cheeks, meanwhile sucking their fingers. Kicks and blows rained freely, and the weakest, trampled upon, cried out."
"Enfin, il avait fait préparer une haute salle, destinée à la réception de ses fournisseurs; ils entraient, s'asseyaient les uns à côté des autres, dans des stalles d'église, et alors il montait dans une chaire magistrale et prêchait le sermon sur le dandysme, adjurant ses bottiers et ses tailleurs de se conformer, de la façon la plus absolue, à ses brefs en matière de coupe, les menaçant d'une excommunication pécuniaire s'ils ne suivaient pas, à la lettre, les instructions contenues dans ses monitoires et ses bulles.","Finally, he had had a high room prepared, intended for the reception of his suppliers; they would come in, sit side by side in the stalls of the church, and then he would come up into a great pulpit and preach the sermon on dandyism, urging his shoemakers and his tailors to conform, in the most more absolute, to his briefs in matters of cutting, threatening them with a pecuniary excommunication if they did not follow, to the letter, the instructions contained in his monitories and his bulls.","His final caprice had been to fit up a lofty hall in which to receive his tradesmen. They used to troop in and take their places side by side in a row of church stalls; then he would ascend an imposing pulpit and preach them a sermon on dandyism,2 adjuring his bootmakers and tailors to conform strictly to his encyclicals on matters of cut, and threatening them with pecuniary excommunication if they did not follow to the letter the instructions contained in his monitories and bulls.","He had constructed, too, a lofty high room intended for the reception of his tradesmen. Here they were ushered in and seated alongside each other in church pews, while from a pulpit he preached to them a sermon on dandyism, adjuring his bootmakers and tailors implicitly to obey his briefs in the matter of style, threatening them with pecuniary excommunication if they failed to follow to the letter the instructions contained in his monitories and bulls."
"Depuis lors, absolument révolté par ces prétextes à Stabat, imaginés par les Pergolèse et les Rossini, par toute cette intrusion de l'art mondain dans l'art liturgique, des Esseintes s'était tenu à l'écart de ces oeuvres équivoques que tolère l'indulgente église.","Since then, absolutely revolted by these pretexts at Stabat, imagined by the Pergolesi and the Rossini, by all this intrusion of worldly art into liturgical art, des Esseintes had kept away from these equivocal works that the indulgent church.","Since then, utterly revolted by the pretexts a Rossini and a Pergolese had thought up for composing a Stabat Mater, by the general invasion of liturgical art by fashionable artists, Des Esseintes had held aloof from all these equivocal compositions tolerated by the over-indulgent Church.","Since then, absolutely revolted by these pretexts at Stabat Maters devised by the Pergolesis and the Rossinis, by this intrusion of profane art in liturgic art, Des Esseintes had shunned those ambiguous works tolerated by the indulgent Church."
"L'autre, l'Engerth, une monumentale et sombre brune aux cris sourds et rauques, aux reins trapus, étranglés dans une cuirasse en fonte, une monstrueuse bête, à la crinière échevelée de fumée noire, aux six roues basses et accouplées, quelle écrasante puissance lorsque, faisant trembler la terre, elle remorque pesamment, lentement, la lourde queue de ses marchandises!","The other, the Engerth, a monumental, gloomy brunette with dull, raucous cries, stocky loins, strangled in a cast-iron cuirass, a monstrous beast, with a disheveled mane of black smoke, six low and coupled wheels, what a overwhelming power when, making the earth tremble, it tows heavily, slowly, the heavy tail of its goods!","The other, Engerth by name, is a strapping saturnine brunette given to uttering raucous, guttural cries, with a thick-set figure encased in armour-plating of cast iron; a monstrous creature with her dishevelled mane of black smoke and her six wheels coupled together low down, she gives an indication of her fantastic strength when, with an effort that shakes the very earth, she slowly and deliberately drags along her heavy train of goods-wagons.","The other, the Engerth, is a nobly proportioned dusky brunette emitting raucous, muffled cries. Her heavy loins are strangled in a cast-iron breast-plate. A monstrous beast with a disheveled mane of black smoke and with six low, coupled wheels!

"Il n'est certainement pas, parmi les frêles beautés blondes et les majestueuses beautés brunes, de pareils types de sveltesse délicate et de terrifiante force; à coup sûr, on peut le dire: l'homme a fait, dans son genre, aussi bien que le Dieu auquel il croit.","There are certainly not, among the frail fair beauties and the majestic dark beauties, such types of delicate slenderness and terrifying strength; certainly, one can say it: the man did, in his kind, as well as the God in which he believes.","It is beyond question that, among all the fair, delicate beauties and all the dark, majestic charmers of the human race, no such superb examples of comely grace and terrifying force are to be found; and it can be stated without fear of contradiction that in his chosen province man has done as well as the God in whom he believes.","Unquestionably, there is not one among the frail blondes and majestic brunettes of the flesh that can vie with their delicate grace and terrific strength."
Il se renfonça dans son fauteuil et huma lentement ce suc fermenté d'avoine et d'orge; un fumet prononcé de créosote lui empuantit la bouche.,He leaned back in his chair and slowly inhaled this fermented juice of oats and barley; a pronounced smell of creosote stinks in his mouth.,"He settled down in his armchair again and slowly sipped this fermented spirit of oats and barley, a pungent odour of creosote spreading through his mouth.",He sank into his easy chair and slowly inhaled this fermented juice of oats and barley: a pronounced taste of creosote was in his mouth.
"Le domestique interrompit les charitables réflexions que ruminait des Esseintes, en lui apportant sur un plat de vermeil la tartine qu'il avait souhaitée. Un haut de coeur le tordit; il n'eut pas le courage de mordre ce pain, car l'excitation maladive de l'estomac avait cessé; une sensation de délabrement affreux lui revenait; il dut se lever; le soleil tournait et gagnait peu à peu sa place; la chaleur devenait à la fois plus pesante et plus active.","The servant interrupted the charitable reflections which Des Esseintes was mulling over, by bringing him on a vermeil platter the slice of bread he had desired. A fit of heart twisted him; he had not the courage to bite this bread, for the unhealthy excitement of the stomach had ceased; a feeling of dreadful dilapidation returned to him; he had to get up; the sun was turning and gaining its place little by little; the heat became both heavier and more active.","Just then Des Esseintes’s man-servant interrupted these charitable reflections of his by bringing him the snack he had asked for on a silver-gilt salver. His gorge rose at the sight; he had not the courage to take even a bite at the bread, for his morbid appetite had deserted him. A dreadful feeling of debility came over him again, but he was forced to get to his feet; the sun was moving round and gradually encroaching on his patch of shadow, the heat becoming fiercer and more oppressive.","The servant interrupted the charitable reflections of Des Esseintes, who received the slice of bread on a plate of vermeil. Pains shot through his heart. He did not have the courage to eat this bread, for the unhealthy excitement of his stomach had ceased. A sensation of frightful decay swept upon him. He was compelled to rise. The sun turned, and slowly fell upon the place that he had lately occupied. The heat became more heavy and fierce."
"Avec Barbey d'Aurevilly, prenait fin la série des écrivains religieux; à vrai dire, ce paria appartenait plus, à tous les points de vue, à la littérature séculière qu'à cette autre chez laquelle il revendiquait une place qu'on lui déniait; sa langue d'un romantisme échevelé, pleine de locutions torses, de tournures inusitées, de comparaisons outrées, enlevait, à coups de fouet, ses phrases qui pétaradaient, en agitant de bruyantes sonnailles, tout le long du texte. En somme, d'Aurevilly apparaissait, ainsi qu'un étalon, parmi ces hongres qui peuplent les écuries ultramontaines.","With Barbey d'Aurevilly, the series of religious writers came to an end; to tell the truth, this pariah belonged more, from all points of view, to secular literature than to that other in which he claimed a place that was denied him; his language of a wild romanticism, full of twisted locutions, unusual turns of phrase, outrageous comparisons, whipped up his phrases which backfired, ringing noisy bells, all along the text. In short, d'Aurevilly appeared, like a stallion, among those geldings that populate the ultramontane stables.","With Barbey d’Aurevilly, the series of religious writers came to an end.

"Cet Africain le réjouissait; la langue latine battait le plein dans ses Métamorphoses; elle roulait des limons, des eaux variées, accourues de toutes les provinces, et toutes se mêlaient, se confondaient en une teinte bizarre, exotique, presque neuve; des maniérismes, des détails nouveaux de la société latine trouvaient à se mouler en des néologismes créés pour les besoins de la conversation, dans un coin romain de l'Afrique; puis sa jovialité d'homme évidemment gras, son exubérance méridionale amusaient. Il apparaissait ainsi qu'un salace et gai compère à côté des apologistes chrétiens qui vivaient, au même siècle, le soporifique Minucius Félix, un pseudo-classique, écoulant dans son Octavius les émulsines encore épaissies de Cicéron, voire même Tertullien qu'il conservait peut-être plus pour son édition de Alde, que pour son oeuvre même.","This African delighted him; the Latin language was in full swing in his Metamorphoses; it rolled down silts, varied waters, flowing in from all the provinces, and all mingled, merged into a bizarre, exotic, almost new hue; mannerisms, new details of Latin society were molded into neologisms created for the needs of conversation, in a Roman corner of Africa; then his obviously fat man's joviality, his southern exuberance amused. It thus appeared that a salacious and gay accomplice next to the Christian apologists who lived, in the same century, the soporific Minucius Felix, a pseudo-classic, flowing in his Octavius the still thickened emulsines of Cicero, even Tertullian which he kept perhaps more for his edition of Aldus than for his own work.","This African author gave him enormous pleasure. The Latin language reached the top of the tide in his Metamorphoses, sweeping along in a dense flood fed by tributary waters from every province, and combining them all in a bizarre, exotic, almost incredible torrent of words; new mannerisms and new details of Latin society found expression in neologisms called into being to meet conversational requirements in an obscure corner of Roman Africa. What was more, Des Esseintes was amused by Apuleius’ exuberance and joviality – the exuberance of a southerner and the joviality of a man who was beyond all question fat. He had the air of a lecherous boon companion compared with the Christian apologists living in the same century – the soporific Minucius Felix for instance, a pseudo-classic in whose Octavius Cicero’s oily phrases have grown thicker and heavier, and even Tertullian, whom he kept more perhaps for the sake of the Aldine edition of his works than for the works themselves.","This African delighted him. The Latin language was at its richest in the Metamorphoses; it contained ooze and rubbish-strewn water rushing from all the provinces, and the refuse mingled and was confused in a bizarre, exotic, almost new color. Mannerisms, new details of Latin society found themselves shaped into neologisms specially created for the needs of conversation, in a Roman corner of Africa. He was amused by the southern exuberance and joviality of a doubtlessly corpulent man. He seemed a salacious, gay crony compared with the Christian apologists who lived in the same century—the soporific Minucius Felix, a pseudo-classicist, pouring forth the still thick emulsions of Cicero into his Octavius; nay, even Tertullian—whom he perhaps preserved for his Aldine edition, more than for the work itself."

"Etant donné également que l'intelligent patriotisme empêchait un théâtre français de représenter un opéra de Wagner, il n'y avait pour les curieux qui ignorent les arcanes de la musique et ne peuvent ou ne veulent se rendre à Bayreuth, qu'à rester chez soi, et c'est le raisonnable parti qu'il avait su prendre.","Given also that intelligent patriotism prevented a French theater from performing an opera by Wagner, there was nothing for the curious who are unaware of the mysteries of music and cannot or do not want to go to Bayreuth, but to stay at himself, and that was the reasonable course he had been able to take.","Considering also that the intelligent patriotism of the French made it impossible for any theatre in the country to put on a Wagner opera, there was nothing left for the keen amateur who was ignorant of the arcana of music and could not or would not travel to Bayreuth but to stay at home, and this was the reasonable course Des Esseintes had adopted.","Granted also that intelligent patriotism forbade a French theatre to give a Wagnerian opera, the only thing left to the curious who know nothing of musical arcana and either cannot or will not betake themselves to Bayreuth, is to remain at home. And that was precisely the course of conduct he had pursued."
"Le tas confus des lectures, des méditations artistiques, qu'il avait accumulées depuis son isolement, ainsi qu'un barrage pour arrêter le courant des anciens souvenirs, avait été brusquement emporté, et le flot s'ébranlait, culbutant le présent, l'avenir, noyant tout sous la nappe du passé, emplissant son esprit d'une immense étendue de tristesse sur laquelle nageaient, semblables à de ridicules épaves, des épisodes sans intérêt de son existence, des riens absurdes.","The confused heap of readings, of artistic meditations, which he had accumulated since his isolation, like a dam to stop the current of old memories, had been suddenly swept away, and the tide shook, tumbling the present, the future, drowning everything under the sheet of the past, filling his mind with an immense expanse of sadness over which swam, like ridiculous wrecks, uninteresting episodes of his existence, absurd trifles.","The confused mass of reading and meditation on artistic themes that he had accumulated since he had been on his own like a barrage to hold back the current of old memories, had suddenly been carried away, and the flood was let loose, sweeping away the present and the future, submerging everything under the waters of the past, covering his mind with a great expanse of melancholy, on the surface of which there drifted, like ridiculous bits of flotsam, trivial episodes of his existence, absurdly insignificant incidents.","The confused medley of meditations on art and literature in which he had indulged since his isolation, as a dam to bar the current of old memories, had been rudely swept away, and the onrushing, irresistible wave crashed into the present and future, submerging everything beneath the blanket of the past, filling his mind with an immensity of sorrow, on whose surface floated, like futile wreckage, absurd trifles and dull episodes of his life."
"Les moins scrupuleux, les moins obtus, jetaient toute vergogne à bas; ils trempaient dans des gabegies, vannaient la bourbe des affaires, comparaissaient, ainsi que de vulgaires filous, en cour d'assises, et ils servaient à rehausser un peu la justice humaine qui, ne pouvant se dispenser toujours d'être partiale, finissait par les nommer bibliothécaires dans les maisons de force.","The less scrupulous, the less obtuse, threw down all shame; they soaked in mismanagement, winnowed the mire of affairs, appeared, like vulgar thieves, in the court of assizes, and they served to enhance a little human justice which, not always being able to dispense with being partial, ended up by appoint them librarians in prisons.","The least scrupulous and the least obtuse among them threw all shame to the winds; they joined in shady deals, splashed about in the financial gutter and finished up like common criminals in the Assize Court, serving at least to add a little lustre to human justice, which, finding it impossible to maintain absolute impartiality, solved the problem by making them prison librarians.","The less scrupulous and stupid threw aside all sense of shame. They weltered in the mire of fraud and deceit, behaved like cheap sharpers."
"En même temps que ses goûts littéraires, que ses préoccupations d'art, s'étaient affinés, ne s'attachant plus qu'aux oeuvres triées à l'étamine, distillées par des cerveaux tourmentés et subtils; en même temps aussi que sa lassitude des idées répandues s'était affirmée, son affection pour les fleurs s'était dégagée de tout résidu, de toute lie, s'était clarifiée, en quelque sorte, rectifiée.","At the same time as his literary tastes, his preoccupations with art, had been refined, no longer attaching himself to works sorted through cheesecloth, distilled by tormented and subtle brains; at the same time, too, that his weariness of popular ideas had asserted itself, his affection for flowers had freed itself of all residue, of all dregs, had been clarified, in a way, rectified.","At the same time that his literary tastes and artistic preferences had become more refined, recognizing only such works as had been sifted and distilled by subtle and tormented minds, and at the same time that his distaste for accepted ideas had hardened into disgust, his love of flowers had rid itself of its residuum, its lees, had been clarified, so to speak, and purified.","Simultaneous with the refinement of his literary taste and his preoccupations with art, which permitted him to be content only in the presence of choice creations, distilled by subtly troubled brains, and simultaneous with the weariness he began to feel in the presence of popular ideas, his love for flowers had grown purged of all impurities and lees, and had become clarified."
Mais il avait surtout éprouvé d'ineffables allégresses à écouter le plain-chant que l'organiste avait maintenu en dépit des idées nouvelles.,But above all he had experienced ineffable joy in listening to the plainsong which the organist had maintained despite the new ideas.,"But above all else he had derived ineffable pleasure from listening to plainsong, to which the organist had remained faithful in defiance of current fashion.",But he particularly extracted ineffable pleasures while listening to the plain-chant which the organist had preserved regardless of new ideas.
"Enfin, le moment échut où il put demeurer levé pendant des après-midi entières et se promener, sans aide, parmi ses pièces. Alors son cabinet de travail l'agaça; des défauts auxquels l'habitude l'avait accoutumé lui sautèrent aux yeux, dès qu'il y revint après une longue absence.",At last the moment came when he could stay up for entire afternoons and walk unaided among his pieces. Then his study annoyed him; faults to which habit had accustomed him leaped into his eyes as soon as he returned to them after a long absence.,At last the time came when he could stay up all afternoon and walk about the house unaided. Now his study began to get on his nerves; faults he had overlooked by force of habit struck him at once on coming back to the room after a long absence.,"At last the day came when he could remain standing for whole afternoons. Then his study irritated him. Certain blemishes it possessed, and which habit had accustomed him to overlook, now were apparent."
"Cette salle à manger ressemblait à la cabine d'un navire avec son plafond voûté, muni de poutres en demi-cercle ses cloisons et son plancher, en bois de pitchpin, sa petite croisée ouverte dans la boiserie, de même qu'un hublot dans un sabord.","This dining room resembled the cabin of a ship with its vaulted ceiling, provided with semicircular beams, its partitions and its floor, made of pitch pine wood, its small open window in the woodwork, as well as a porthole in a porthole.","This dining-room resembled a ship’s cabin, with its ceiling of arched beams, its bulkheads and floorboards of pitch-pine, and the little window-opening let into the wainscoting like a porthole.","With its vaulted ceiling fitted with beams in a half circle, its bulkheads and floor of pine, and the little window in the wainscoting that looked like a porthole, the dining room resembled the cabin of a ship."
"Cette période fut de courte durée; il eut une sieste de mémoire, se replongea dans ses études latines afin d'effacer jusqu'à l'empreinte même de ces retours.","This period was short-lived; he took a siesta of memory, plunged back into his Latin studies in order to erase even the very imprint of these returns.","This phase lasted only a little while and then his memory took a siesta. He took advantage of this respite to immerse himself once more in his Latin studies, in the hope of effacing every sign, every trace of these recollections.","This phase had not lasted long. His memory gave him respite and he plunged again into his Latin studies, so as to efface the impressions of such recollections."
"Il se retrouva sur le chemin, dégrisé, seul, abominablement lassé, implorant une fin que la lâcheté de sa chair l'empêchait d'atteindre.","He found himself on the road, sobered, alone, abominably tired, imploring an end that the cowardice of his flesh prevented him from achieving.","When he came to his senses again, he found that he was utterly alone, completely disillusioned, abominably tired; and he longed to make an end of it all, prevented only by the cowardice of his flesh.","He recovered, but he was lonely, tired, sobered, imploring an end to his life which the cowardice of his flesh prevented him from consummating."
"Grâce à ses odieuses précautions, celui-là avait reculé, pendant des années, la mort d'êtres inintelligents et insensibles, de telle façon que, devenus, plus tard, presque compréhensifs et, en tout cas, aptes à la douleur, ils pussent prévoir l'avenir, attendre et redouter cette mort dont ils ignoraient naguère jusqu'au nom, quelques-uns même, l'appeler, en haine de cette condamnation à l'existence qu'il leur infligeait en vertu d'un code théologique absurde!","Thanks to his odious precautions, this one had postponed, for years, the death of unintelligent and insensitive beings, in such a way that, later having become almost understanding and, in any case, capable of suffering, they could to foresee the future, to await and dread this death, the very name of which they did not know until recently, some even, to call it, in hatred of this condemnation to existence which it inflicted on them by virtue of an absurd theological code !","Thanks to his odious precautions, the man had postponed for years to come the deaths of creatures devoid of thought or feeling, so that later, having acquired a little understanding and a far greater capacity for suffering, they could look into the future, could expect and dread that death whose very name had hitherto been unknown to them, could even, in some cases, call upon it to release them from the hateful life-sentence to which he had condemned them in virtue of an absurd theological code.","By means of his hateful precautions, Vincent de Paul had deferred for years the death of unintelligent and insensate beings, in such a way that when they later became almost intelligent and sentient to grief, they were able to anticipate the future, to await and fear that death of whose very name they had of late been ignorant, some of them going as far to invoke it, in hatred of that sentence of life which the monk inflicted upon them by an absurd theological code."
"À l'encontre de Verlaine qui dérivait, sans croisement, de Baudelaire, surtout par le côté psychologique, par la nuance captieuse de la pensée, par la docte quintessence du sentiment, Théodore Hannon descendait du maître, surtout par le côté plastique, par la vision extérieure des êtres et des choses.","Contrary to Verlaine who derived, without crossing, from Baudelaire, especially by the psychological side, by the captious nuance of the thought, by the learned quintessence of the feeling, Théodore Hannon descended from the master, especially by the plastic side, by the external vision of beings and things.","Unlike Verlaine, who was directly descended from Baudelaire, without any cross-breeding, especially in his psychology, in the sophistical slant of his thought, in the skilled distillation of his feeling, Théodore Hannon’s kinship with the master could be seen chiefly in the plastic side of his poetry, in his external view of people and things.","Unlike Verlaine whose work was directly influenced by Baudelaire, especially on the psychological side, in his insidious nuances of thought and skilful quintessence of sentiment, Théodore Hannon especially descended from the master on the plastic side, by the external vision of persons and things."

"Le mouvement lui paraissait d'ailleurs inutile et l'imagination lui semblait pouvoir aisément suppléer à la vulgaire réalité des faits. à son avis, il était possible de contenter les désirs réputés les plus difficiles à satisfaire dans la vie normale, et cela par un léger subterfuge, par une approximative sophistication de l'objet poursuivi par ces désirs mêmes. Ainsi, il est bien évident que tout gourmet se délecte aujourd'hui, dans les restaurants renommés par l'excellence de leurs caves, en buvant les hauts crus fabriqués avec de basses vinasses traitées suivant la méthode de M. Pasteur. Or, vrais et faux, ces vins ont le même arôme, la même couleur, le même bouquet, et par conséquent le plaisir qu'on éprouve en dégustant ces breuvages altérés et factices est absolument identique à celui que l'on goûterait en savourant le vin naturel et pur qui serait introuvable, même à prix d'or.","Moreover, movement seemed to him useless, and imagination seemed to him to be able to easily supply the vulgar reality of facts. in his opinion, it was possible to satisfy the desires reputed to be the most difficult to satisfy in normal life, and that by a slight subterfuge, by an approximate sophistication of the object pursued by these very desires. Thus, it is quite obvious that any gourmet delights today, in restaurants renowned for the excellence of their cellars, by drinking the high wines made with low vinasse treated according to the method of Mr. Pasteur. Now, true and false, these wines have the same aroma, the same color, the same bouquet, and consequently the pleasure that one experiences in tasting these altered and artificial beverages is absolutely identical to that which one would taste in savoring the natural and pure wine that would be unobtainable, even at the price of gold.","Travel, indeed, struck him as being a waste of time, since he believed that the imagination could provide a more-than-adequate substitute for the vulgar reality of actual experience. In his opinion it was perfectly possible to fulfil those desires commonly supposed to be the most difficult to satisfy under normal conditions, and this by the trifling subterfuge of producing a fair imitation of the object of those desires. Thus it is well known that nowadays, in restaurants famed for the excellence of their cellars, the gourmets go into raptures over rare vintages manufactured out of cheap wines treated according to Monsieur Pasteur’s method.4 Now, whether they are genuine or faked, these wines have the same aroma, the same colour, the same bouquet; and consequently the pleasure experienced in tasting these factitious, sophisticated beverages is absolutely identical with that which would be afforded by the pure, unadulterated wine, now unobtainable at any price.","Movement, after all, seemed futile to him. He felt that imagination could easily be substituted for the vulgar realities of things. It was possible, in his opinion, to gratify the most extravagant, absurd desires by a subtle subterfuge, by a slight modification of the object of one's wishes. Every epicure nowadays enjoys, in restaurants celebrated for the excellence of their cellars, wines of capital taste manufactured from inferior brands treated by Pasteur's method. For they have the same aroma, the same color, the same bouquet as the rare wines of which they are an imitation, and consequently the pleasure experienced in sipping them is identical."
"Mais, dans ce recueil, avaient été colligés certains poèmes sauvés de revues mortes: Le Démon de l'analogie, La Pipe, Le Pauvre Fnfant pâle, Le Spectacle interrompu, Le Phénomène futur, et surtout Plaintes d'automne et Frisson d'hiver, qui étaient les chefs-d'oeuvre de Mallarmé et comptaient également parmi les chefs-d'oeuvre du poème en prose, car ils unissaient une langue si magnifiquement ordonnée qu'elle berçait, par elle-même, ainsi qu'une mélancolique incantation, qu'une enivrante mélodie, à des pensées d'une suggestion irrésistible, à des pulsations d'âme de sensitif dont les nerfs en émoi vibrent avec une acuité qui vous pénètre jusqu'au ravissement, jusqu'à la douleur.","But, in this collection, had been collected certain poems saved from dead journals: The Demon of Analogy, The Pipe, The Poor Pale Child, The Interrupted Spectacle, The Future Phenomenon, and especially Plaintes d'automne and Frisson d'hiver , which were the masterpieces of Mallarmé and also counted among the masterpieces of the prose poem, for they united a language so magnificently ordered that it rocked, by itself, as well as a melancholy incantation , than an intoxicating melody, to thoughts of an irresistible suggestion, to pulsations of the sensitive soul whose nerves in turmoil vibrate with an acuity that penetrates you to the point of delight, to the point of pain.","But this was not all. The collection also contained sundry pieces rescued from extinct reviews: Le Démon de l’analogie, La Pipe, Le Pauvre Enfant pâle, Le Spectacle interrompu, Le Phénomène futur and above all Plainte d’automne and Frisson d’hiver. These were Mallarmé’s masterpieces and also ranked among the masterpieces of prose poetry, for they combined a style so magnificently contrived than in itself it was as soothing as a melancholy incantation, an intoxicating melody, with irresistibly suggestive thoughts, the soul-throbs of a sensitive artist whose quivering nerves vibrate with an intensity that fills you with painful ecstasy.","But in this collection had been gathered certain poems resurrected from defunct reviews: le Démon de l'analogie, la Pipe, le Pauvre enfant pâle, le Spectacle interrompu, le Phénomène futur, and especially Plaintes d'automne and Frisson d'hiver which were Mallarmé's masterpieces and were also celebrated among the masterpieces of prose poems, for they united such a magnificently delicate language that they cradled, like a melancholy incantation or a maddening melody, thoughts of an irresistible suggestiveness, pulsations of the soul of a sensitive person whose excited nerves vibrate with a keenness which penetrates ravishingly and induces a sadness."
"Dans le premier cas, le style Louis XV s'imposait aux délicats, aux gens épuisés surtout par des éréthismes de cervelle; seul, en effet, le XVIIIe siècle a su envelopper la femme d'une atmosphère vicieuse, contournant les meubles selon la forme de ses charmes, imitant les contractions de ses plaisirs; les volutes de ses spasmes, avec les ondulations, les tortillements du bois et du cuivre, épiçant la langueur sucrée de la blonde, par son décor vif et clair, atténuant le goût salé de la brune, par des tapisseries aux tons douceâtres, aqueux, presque insapides.","In the first case, the Louis XV style imposed itself on the delicate, on people exhausted above all by erethisms of the brain; only, in fact, the eighteenth century knew how to envelop woman in a vicious atmosphere, circumventing furniture according to the shape of her charms, imitating the contractions of her pleasures; the volutes of its spasms, with the undulations, the twists of wood and copper, spicing up the sweet languor of the blonde, by its lively and clear decoration, attenuating the salty taste of the brunette, by tapestries in sweetish, watery tones, almost tasteless.","In the first case, the Louis-Quinze style was the obvious choice for people of delicate sensibility, exhausted by mental stimulation above all else. The eighteenth century is, in fact, the only age which has known how to develop woman in a wholly depraved atmosphere, shaping its furniture on the model of her charms, imitating her passionate contortions and spasmodic convulsions in the curves and convolutions of wood and copper, spicing the sugary languor of the blonde with its bright, light furnishings, and mitigating the salty savour of the brunette with tapestries of delicate, watery, almost insipid hues.","For the first instance, the Louis XV style was inevitable for the fastidious, for the cerebrally morbid. Only the eighteenth century had succeeded in enveloping woman with a vicious atmosphere, imitating her contours in the undulations and twistings of wood and copper, accentuating the sugary languor of the blond with its clear and lively décors, attenuating the pungency of the brunette with its tapestries of aqueous, sweet, almost insipid tones."
"Invinciblement, il levait les yeux vers elle, la discernait à ses contours inoubliés et elle revivait, évoquant sur ses lèvres ces bizarres et doux vers que Mallarmé lui prête:","Invincibly, he raised his eyes towards her, discerned her by her unforgotten contours and she came to life again, evoking on his lips those bizarre and gentle verses that Mallarmé attributed to her:","His eyes were irresistibly drawn towards her, following the familiar outlines of her body until she came to life again before him, bringing to his lips those sweet, strange words that Mallarmé puts into her mouth:","At such times he was forced to gaze upon her unforgotten outlines; and she lived for him, her lips articulating those bizarre and delicate lines which Mallarmé makes her utter:"
"Après ces divagations mystiques, l'écrivain avait eu une période d'accalmie; puis une terrible rechute s'était produite.","After these mystical ramblings, the writer had had a period of calm; then a terrible relapse had occurred.","After these mystical divagations, Barbey had enjoyed a period of comparative calm, but then a frightening relapse had occurred.","After these mystic divagations, the writer had experienced a period of calm.

"Sa grande joie était de descendre dans le vallon, de gagner Jutigny, un village planté au pied des collines, un petit tas de maisonnettes coiffées de bonnets de chaume parsemés de touffes de joubarbe et de bouquets de mousse. Il se couchait dans la prairie, à l'ombre des hautes meules, écoutant le bruit sourd des moulins à eau, humant le souffle frais de la Voulzie. Parfois, il poussait jusqu'aux tourbières, jusqu'au hameau vert et noir de Longueville, ou bien il grimpait sur les côtes balayées par le vent et d'où l'étendue était immense. Là, il avait d'un côté, sous lui, la vallée de la Seine, fuyant à perte de vue et se confondant avec le bleu du ciel fermé au loin ; de l'autre, tout en haut, à l'horizon, les églises et la tour de Provins qui semblaient trembler, au soleil, dans la pulvérulence dorée de l'air.","His great joy was to descend into the valley, to reach Jutigny, a village planted at the foot of the hills, a little heap of little houses topped with thatch caps strewn with tufts of houseleek and bouquets of moss. He lay down in the meadow, in the shade of the tall millstones, listening to the muffled noise of the watermills, inhaling the fresh breath of the Voulzie. Sometimes it pushed on to the peat bogs, to the green and black hamlet of Longueville, or else it climbed the windswept coasts from where the expanse was immense. There, he had on one side, under him, the valley of the Seine, fleeing as far as the eye could see and merging with the blue of the sky closed in the distance; on the other, at the very top, on the horizon, the churches and the tower of Provins which seemed to quiver, in the sun, in the golden dustiness of the air.","His chief delight was to go down into the valley to Jutigny, a village lying at the foot of the hills, a little cluster of cottages wearing thatch bonnets decorated with sprigs of stonecrop and patches of moss. He used to lie down in the meadows, in the shadow of the tall hayricks, listening to the dull rumble of the water-mills and breathing in the fresh breezes coming from the Voulzie. Sometimes he would go as far as the peateries and the hamlet of Longueville with its green and black houses, or else he would scramble up the windswept hillsides from which he could survey an immense prospect. On the one hand he could look down on the Seine valley, winding away into the distance where it merged into the blue sky, and on the other he could see, far away on the horizon, the churches and the great tower of Provins, which seemed to tremble under the sun’s rays in a dusty golden haze.","It was his supreme delight to wander down the little valley to Jutigny, a village planted at the foot of the hills, a tiny heap of cottages capped with thatch strewn with tufts of sengreen and clumps of moss. In the open fields, under the shadow of high ricks, he would lie, listening to the hollow splashing of the mills and inhaling the fresh breeze from Voulzie. Sometimes he went as far as the peat-bogs, to the green and black hamlet of Longueville, or climbed wind-swept hillsides affording magnificent views. There, below to one side, as far as the eye could reach, lay the Seine valley, blending in the distance with the blue sky; high up, near the horizon, on the other side, rose the churches and tower of Provins which seemed to tremble in the golden dust of the air."
"Il commença par remuer toute sa bibliothèque latine, puis il disposa dans un nouvel ordre les ouvrages spéciaux d'Archélaüs, d'Albert le Grand, de Lulle, d'Arnaud de Villanova traitant de kabbale et de sciences occultes; enfin il compulsa, un à un, ses livres modernes, et joyeusement il constata que tous étaient demeurés, au sec, intacts.","He began by moving his entire Latin library, then he arranged in a new order the special works of Archelaus, Albert the Great, Lully, Arnaud de Villanova dealing with Kabbalah and the occult sciences; finally he consulted, one by one, his modern books, and happily noted that they had all remained, dry, intact.","He began by going through the whole of his Latin library; then he rearranged the specialist works by Archelaus, Albertus Magnus, Raymond Lully and Arnaud de Villanova1 dealing with the cabbala and the occult sciences; and lastly he checked all his modern books one by one.

"Seulement, si cette résignation tout bonnement issue de la constatation d'un état de choses déplorable et de l'impossibilité d'y rien changer, était accessible aux riches de l'esprit, elle n'était que plus difficilement saisissable aux pauvres dont la bienfaisante religion calmait plus aisément alors les revendications et les colères,","Only, if this resignation, simply resulting from the observation of a deplorable state of affairs and the impossibility of changing anything about it, was accessible to the rich in spirit, it was only more difficult to grasp for the poor whose beneficent religion then more easily calmed claims and anger,","However, if this resignation, frankly based on the recognition of a deplorable state of affairs and the impossibility of effecting any change, was accessible to the rich in intellect, that made it all the more difficult of attainment for the poor, whose clamorous wrath was more easily appeased by the kindly voice of religion.","But if this resignation, which was obviously the only outcome of the deplorable condition of things and their irremediability, was open to the spiritually rich, it was all the more difficult of approach to the poor whose passions and cravings were more easily satisfied by the benefits of religion."
"Rongé par une ardente fièvre, des Esseintes entendit subitement des murmures d'eau, des vols de guêpes, puis ces bruits se fondirent en un seul qui ressemblait au ronflement d'un tour; ce ronflement s'éclaircit, s'atténua et peu à peu se décida en un son argentin de cloche.","Consumed by a burning fever, Des Esseintes suddenly heard the murmurs of water, the flight of wasps, then these noises merged into a single sound which resembled the humming of a lathe; this snoring cleared up, died down, and little by little settled into the silvery sound of a bell.","Consumed with a burning fever, Des Esseintes suddenly heard the sounds of running water, of buzzing wasps; then these noises merged into one which resembled the humming of a lathe, and this humming grew shriller and clearer until it eventually changed into the silvery note of a bell.","Attacked by a strong fever, Des Esseintes suddenly heard murmurings of water; then those sounds united into one and resembled a roaring which increased and then slowly resolved itself into a silvery bell sound."
"Il avait toujours raffolé des fleurs, mais cette passion qui, pendant ses séjours à Jutigny, s'était tout d'abord étendue à la fleur, sans distinction ni d'espèces ni de genres, avait fini par s'épurer, par se préciser sur une seule caste.","He had always loved flowers, but this passion which, during his stays in Jutigny, had first of all extended to flowers, without distinction of either species or genera, had ended up being purified, becoming more precise. on one caste.","Des Esseintes had always been excessively fond of flowers, but this passion of his, which at Jutigny had originally embraced all flowers without distinction of species or genus, had finally become more discriminating, limiting itself to a single caste.","He had always been passionately fond of flowers, but during his residence at Jutigny, that love had been lavished upon flowers of all sorts; he had never cultivated distinctions and discriminations in regard to them. Now his taste in this direction had grown refined and self-conscious."
"L'un d'eux, Paul Verlaine, avait jadis débuté par un volume de vers, les Poèmes Saturniens, un volume presque débile, où se coudoyaient des pastiches de Leconte de Lisle et des exercices de rhétorique romantique, mais où filtrait déjà, au travers de certaines pièces, telles que le sonnet intitulé ""Rêve familier"", la réelle personnalité du poète.","One of them, Paul Verlaine, had formerly begun with a volume of verse, the Poèmes Saturniens, an almost stupid volume, where pastiches of Leconte de Lisle jostled and exercises in romantic rhetoric, but where already filtered, at the through certain pieces, such as the sonnet entitled ""Family Dream"", the real personality of the poet.","One of these writers, Paul Verlaine,5 had made his début a good many years before with a volume of verse, Poèmes saturniens, a work which might almost be described as feeble, in which pastiches of Leconte de Lisle rubbed shoulders with exercises in romantic rhetoric, but which already revealed in certain pieces, such as the sonnet Mon Rêve familier, the real personality of the poet.","One of them was Paul Verlaine who had begun with a volume of verse, the Poèmes Saturniens, a rather ineffectual book where imitations of Leconte de Lisle jostled with exercises in romantic rhetoric, but through which already filtered the real personality of the poet in such poems as the sonnet Rêve Familier."

"Depuis son extrême jeunesse, il avait été torturé par d'inexplicables répulsions, par des frémissements qui lui glaçaient l'échine, lui contractaient les dents, par exemple, quand il voyait du linge mouillé qu'une bonne était en train de tordre; ces effets avaient toujours persisté; aujourd'hui encore il souffrait réellement à entendre déchirer une étoffe, à frotter un doigt sur un bout de craie, à tâter avec la main un morceau de moire.","Since his extreme youth, he had been tortured by inexplicable repulsions, by quiverings which froze his spine, made his teeth contract, for example, when he saw wet linen being wrung out by a maid; these effects had always persisted; even today he really suffered from hearing a cloth tear, from rubbing a finger on a piece of chalk, from feeling a piece of moire with his hand.","Ever since his earliest childhood, he had been tormented by inexplicable revulsions, by shuddering fits which chilled him to the marrow and set his teeth on edge whenever, for instance, he saw a maid wringing out some wet linen. These instinctive reactions had continued down the years, and to this day it still caused him real suffering to hear a piece of stuff being torn in two, to rub his finger over a bit of chalk, to feel the surface of watered silk.","He had been tortured since his youth by inexplicable aversions, by shudderings which chilled his spine and made him grit his teeth, as, for example, when he saw a girl wringing wet linen. These reactions had long persisted. Even now he suffered poignantly when he heard the tearing of cloth, the rubbing of a finger against a piece of chalk, or a hand touching a bit of moire."
"Il possédait de cet artiste fantasque et lugubre, véhément et farouche, la série de ses Persécutions religieuses, d'épouvantables planches contenant tous les supplices que la folie des religions a inventés, des planches où hurlait le spectacle des souffrances humaines, des corps rissolés sur des brasiers, des crânes décalottés avec des sabres, trépanés avec des clous, entaillés avec des scies, des intestins dévidés du ventre et enroulés sur des bobines, des ongles lentement arrachés avec des tenailles, des prunelles crevées, des paupières retournées avec des pointes, des membres disloqués, cassés avec soin, des os mis à nu, longuement râclés avec des lames.","He possessed from this whimsical and lugubrious, vehement and fierce artist, the series of his Religious Persecutions, frightful plates containing all the tortures that the madness of religions has invented, plates on which the spectacle of human suffering howled, bodies browned on braziers, skulls decapped with sabers, trepanned with nails, nicked with saws, intestines stripped from the belly and rolled up on reels, fingernails slowly torn out with pincers, eyeballs gouged out, eyelids turned upside down with spikes, dislocated limbs, carefully broken, bared bones, long scraped with blades.","He possessed a whole series of studies by this artist in lugubrious fantasy and ferocious cruelty: his Religious Persecutions, a collection of appalling plates displaying all the tortures which religious fanaticism has invented, revealing all the agonizing varieties of human suffering – bodies roasted over braziers, heads scalped with swords, trepanned with nails, lacerated with saws, bowels taken out of the belly and wound on to bobbins, finger-nails slowly removed with pincers, eyes put out, eyelids pinned back, limbs dislocated and carefully broken, bones laid bare and scraped for hours with knives.","He possessed of the work of this artist, who was fantastic and melancholy, vehement and wild, the series of his Religious Persecutions, horrible prints depicting all the agonies invented by the madness of religions: prints pregnant with human sufferings, showing bodies roasting on fires, skulls slit open with swords, trepaned with nails and gashed with saws, intestines separated from the abdomen and twisted on spools, finger nails slowly extracted with pincers, eyes gouged, limbs dislocated and deliberately broken, and bones bared of flesh and agonizingly scraped by sheets of metal."
"C'était l'agonie de la vieille langue qui, après s'être persillée de siècle en siècle, finissait par se dissoudre, par atteindre ce déliquium de la langue latine qui expirait dans les mystérieux concepts et les énigmatiques expressions de saint Boniface et de saint Adhelme.","It was the agony of the old language which, after being marred from century to century, ended by dissolving, by reaching that deliquium of the Latin language which expired in the mysterious concepts and enigmatic expressions of Saint Boniface and Saint Adhelme.","This was the death-agony of the old tongue which, after going a little greener every century, had now reached the point of dissolution, the same stage of deliquescence as the Latin language when it breathed its last in the mysterious concepts and enigmatic phrases of St Boniface and St Adhelm.","It was the agony of the old language which, after having become moldy from age to age, ended by dissolving, by reaching that deliquescence of the Latin language which expired in the mysterious concepts and the enigmatical expressions of Saint Boniface and Saint Adhelme."
"Conçues par un moine à jeun, pris de délire, ces scènes se déroulaient dans le style capricant d'un agité; malheureusement parmi ces créatures détraquées ainsi que des Coppélia galvanisées d'Hoffmann, d'aucunes, telles que le Néel de Néhou, semblaient avoir été imaginées dans ces moments d'affaissement qui succèdent aux crises, et elles détonnaient dans cet ensemble de folie, ombre où elles apportaient l'involontaire comique que dégage la vue d'un petit seigneur de zinc, qui joue du cor, en bottes molles, sur le socle d'une pendule.","Conceived by a fasting monk, seized with delirium, these scenes unfolded in the capricious style of a restless man; unfortunately among these deranged creatures like the galvanized Coppélias of Hoffmann, some, such as the Néel of Néhou, seemed to have been imagined in these moments of collapse which follow crises, and they clashed in this set of madness, shadow where they brought the comical involuntaryness that the sight of a little zinc lord emanates, who plays the horn, in soft boots, on the base of a clock.","These scenes, like the fantasies of a fasting monk affected with delirium, were unfolded in the disjointed language of a fever patient. But unfortunately, among all the characters galvanized into an unbalanced life like so many Hoffmann Coppelias, there were some, the Néel de Néhou for instance, who seemed to have been imagined in one of those periods of prostration that always follow crises; and they were out of keeping in this atmosphere of melancholy madness, into which they introduced the same note of unintentional humour as is sounded by the little zinc lordling in hunting-boots who stands blowing his horn on the pedestal of so many mantelpiece clocks.","Conceived by a fasting monk in the grip of delirium, these scenes were unfolded in the uneven style of a tortured soul. Unfortunately, among those disordered creatures that were like galvanized Coppelias of Hoffmann, some, like Néel de Néhou, seemed to have been imagined in moments of exhaustion following convulsions, and were discordant notes in this harmony of sombre madness, where they were as comical and ridiculous as a tiny zinc figure playing on a horn on a timepiece."
"La pluie entrait en diagonale par les portières; des Esseintes dut relever les glaces que l'eau raya de ses cannelures tandis que des gouttes de fange rayonnaient comme un feu d'artifice de tous les côtés du fiacre. Au bruit monotone des sacs de pois secoués sur sa tête par l'ondée dégoulinant sur les malles et sur le couvercle de la voiture, des Esseintes rêvait à son voyage; c'était déjà un acompte de l'Angleterre qu'il prenait à Paris par cet affreux temps; un Londres pluvieux, colossal, immense, puant la fonte échauffée et la suie, fumant sans relâche dans la brume se déroulait maintenant devant ses yeux; puis des enfilades de docks s'étendaient à perte de vue, pleins de grues, de cabestans, de ballots, grouillant d'hommes perchés sur des mâts, à califourchon sur des vergues, alors que, sur les quais, des myriades d'autres hommes étaient penchés, le derrière en l'air, sur des barriques qu'ils poussaient dans des caves.","The rain entered diagonally through the doors; Des Esseintes had to raise the windows, which the water scratched with its grooves while drops of mire radiated like fireworks from all sides of the cab. To the monotonous sound of the sacks of peas shaken on his head by the shower dripping on the trunks and on the lid of the carriage, Des Esseintes dreamed of his journey; it was already a down payment from England which he was taking in Paris in this dreadful weather; a rainy, colossal, immense London, reeking of hot iron and soot, smoking relentlessly in the mist now unfolded before his eyes; then rows of docks stretched as far as the eye could see, full of cranes, capstans, bales, teeming with men perched on masts, astride yards, while on the quays myriads of other men were leaning, their backs in the air, over barrels which they were pushing into cellars.","The rain was slanting in at the windows, so that Des Esseintes had to pull up the glass; this was quickly streaked with trickles of water, while clots of mud spurted up from all sides of the cab like sparks from a firework. Lulled by the monotonous sound of the rain beating down on his trunks and on the carriage roof, like sacks of peas being emptied out over his head, Des Esseintes began dreaming of his coming journey. The appalling weather struck him as an instalment of English life paid to him on account in Paris; and his mind conjured up a picture of London as an immense, sprawling, rain-drenched metropolis, stinking of soot and hot iron, and wrapped in a perpetual mantle of smoke and fog. He could see in imagination a line of dockyards stretching away into the distance, full of cranes, capstans and bales of merchandise, and swarming with men – some perched on the masts and sitting astride the yards, while hundreds of others, their heads down and bottoms up, were trundling casks along the quays and into the cellars.","The rain entered diagonally through the carriage doors. Des Esseintes was obliged to lift the carriage windows down which the water ran, while drops of mud furrowed their way like fireworks on each side of the fiacre. To the monotonous sound of sacks of peas shaking against his head through the action of the showers pattering against the trunks and on the carriage rug, Des Esseintes dreamed of his voyage. This already was a partial realization of his England, enjoyed in Paris through the means of this frightful weather: a rainy, colossal London smelling of molten metal and of soot, ceaselessly steaming and smoking in the fog now spread out before his eyes; then rows of docks sprawled ahead, as far as the eye could reach, docks full of cranes, hand winches and bales, swarming with men perched on masts or astride yard sails, while myriads of other men on the quays pushed hogsheads into cellars."

"La force du sadisme, l'attrait qu'il présente, gît donc tout entier dans la jouissance prohibée de transférer à Satan les hommages et les prières qu'on doit à Dieu; il gît donc dans l'inobservance des préceptes catholiques qu'on suit même à rebours, en commettant, afin de bafouer plus gravement le Christ, les péchés qu'il a le plus expressément maudits: la pollution du culte et l'orgie charnelle.","The strength of sadism, the attraction it presents, therefore lies entirely in the prohibited enjoyment of transferring to Satan the homage and prayers that one owes to God; he therefore lies in the non-observance of Catholic precepts, which are followed even backwards, by committing, in order to flout Christ more seriously, the sins which he has most expressly cursed: the pollution of worship and carnal orgy.","The strength of sadism then, the attraction it offers, lies entirely in the forbidden pleasure of transferring to Satan the homage and the prayers that should go to God; it lies in the flouting of the precepts of Catholicism, which the sadist actually observes in topsy-turvy fashion when, in order to offend Christ the more grievously, he commits the sins Christ most expressly proscribed – profanation of holy things and carnal debauch.","The power of sadism and the attraction it presents, lies entirely then in the prohibited enjoyment of transferring to Satan the praises and prayers due to God; it lies in the non-observance of Catholic precepts which one really follows unwillingly, by committing in deeper scorn of Christ, those sins which the Church has especially cursed, such as pollution of worship and carnal orgy."

"Un matin, pourtant, ces bruits se calmèrent; il se posséda mieux et demanda au domestique de lui présenter une glace; elle lui glissa aussitôt des mains; il se reconnaissait à peine -, la figure était couleur de terre, les lèvres boursouflées et sèches, la langue ridée, la peau rugueuse; ses cheveux et sa barbe que le domestique n'avait plus taillés depuis la maladie, ajoutaient encore à l'horreur de la face creuse, des yeux agrandis et liquoreux qui brûlaient d'un éclat fébrile dans cette tête de squelette, hérissée de poils.

More than his weakness, than his incoercible vomiting which rejected any attempt at food, more than this slump into which he was sinking, this change of face frightened him. He thought he was lost, then, in the depression which crushed him, the energy of a man cornered put him on his feet, gave him the strength to write a letter to his doctor in Paris and to order the servant to go to the moment looking for him and bringing him back, whatever the cost, the same day.","One morning, however, these noises died away; he felt in fuller possession of his faculties and asked his man to hand him a mirror.

He scarcely knew himself; his face was an earthen colour, the lips dry and swollen , the tongue all furrowed, the skin wrinkled; his untidy hair and beard, which his servant had not trimmed since the beginning of his illness, added to the horrific impression created by the hollow cheeks and the big, watery eyes burning with a feverish brightness in this hairy death’s-head. This change in his facial appearance alarmed him more than his weakness, more than the uncontrollable fits of vomiting that thwarted his every attempt at taking food, more than the depression into which he was gradually sinking. He thought he was done for; but then, in spite of his overwhelming despondency, the energy of a man in desperate straits brought him to a sitting position in bed and gave him the strength to write a letter to his Paris doctor and order his servant to go to him immediately and bring him back with him, whatever the cost, the same day.","One morning, nevertheless, he felt more tranquil and requested the servant to bring a looking-glass. It fell from his hands. He hardly recognized himself. His face was a clay color, the lips bloated and dry, the tongue parched, the skin rough. His hair and beard, untended since his illness by the domestic, added to the horror of the sunken face and staring eyes burning with feverish intensity in this skeleton head that bristled with hair. More than his weakness, more than his vomitings which began with each attempt at taking nourishment, more than his emaciation, did his changed visage terrify him. He felt lost. Then, in the dejection which overcame him, a sudden energy forced him in a sitting posture. He had strength to write a letter to his Paris physician and to order the servant to depart instantly, seek and bring him back that very day."
"Il sortait de leurs livres à jeun, et il en était de même de ceux d'Hugo; le côté Orient et patriarche était trop convenu, trop vide, pour le retenir; et le côté tout à la fois bonne d'enfant et grand-père, l'exaspérait; il lui fallait arriver aux Chansons des rues et des bois pour hennir devant l'impeccable jonglerie de sa métrique, mais combien, en fin de compte, il eût échangé tous ces tours de force pour une nouvelle oeuvre de Baudelaire qui fût l'égale de l'ancienne, car décidément celui-là était à peu près le seul dont les vers continssent, sous leur splendide écorce, une balsamique et nutritive moelle!","He came out of their books on an empty stomach, and it was the same with Hugo's; the Orient and patriarch side was too conventional, too empty, to retain him; and the side that was both nanny and grandfather exasperated him; he had to get to the Chansons des streets et des bois to neigh before the impeccable juggling of his meter, but how, in the end, he would have exchanged all these tours de force for a new work by Baudelaire which was the equal of the old one, for this one was definitely about the only one whose worms contained, under their splendid bark, a balsamic and nutritious marrow!","He used to put their books down feeling hungry and unsatisfied, and the same was true of Hugo’s. The Oriental, patriarchal aspect was too trite and hollow to retain his interest, while the nursery-maidish, grandfatherly pose annoyed him intensely. It was not until he came to the Chansons de srues et des bois that he could unreservedly enjoy the impeccable jugglery of Hugo’s prosody; and even then, he would gladly have given all these tours de force for a new work of Baudelaire’s of the same quality as the old, for the latter was without a doubt almost the only author whose verses, underneath their splendid shell, contained a balsamic and nutritious kernel.","And it was the same with Hugo; the oriental and patriarchal side was too conventional and barren to detain him. And his manners, at once childish and that of a grandfather, exasperated him. He had to go to the Chansons des rues et des bois to enjoy the perfect acrobatics of his metrics. But how gladly, after all, would he not have exchanged all this tour de force for a new work by Baudelaire which might equal the others, for he, decidedly, was almost the only one whose verses, under their splendid form, contained a healing and nutritive substance."
"Avec cela, il méprisait le monde, abandonnait ses biens aux pauvres, vivait d'un morceau de pain; il avait fini par s'embarquer, avec une vieille servante, fanatisée par lui, et il allait au hasard, où abordait son bateau, prêchant partout l'évangile, s'essayant à ne plus manger, devenu à peu près fou, presque sauvage.","With that, he despised the world, abandoned his goods to the poor, lived on a piece of bread; he had ended up embarking with an old servant, fanaticized by him, and he went at random where his boat landed, preaching the gospel everywhere, trying not to eat, becoming almost mad, almost wild. .","What is more, he despised the world, and this led him to give all he possessed to the poor, living on a crust of bread himself. In the end he had put to sea with an old maid-servant who was fanatically devoted to him, landing wherever his boat came ashore, preaching the Gospel to all and sundry, trying to live without eating – a man with little or nothing to distinguish him from a lunatic or a savage.","And he scorned the world, surrendering his wealth to the poor and subsisting on a slice of bread. He ended his life in travelling, with an equally fanatical servant, going where chance led his boat, preaching the Gospel far and wide, endeavoring to forego nourishment, and eventually becoming almost demented and violent."
"La mère, une longue femme, silencieuse et blanche, mourut d'épuisement ; à son tour le père décéda d'une maladie vague ; des Esseintes atteignait alors sa dix-septième année.","The mother, a long woman, silent and white, died of exhaustion; in turn the father died of a vague illness; Des Esseintes was then reaching his seventeenth year.","His mother, a tall, pale, silent woman, died of nervous exhaustion. Then it was his father’s turn to succumb to some obscure illness when Des Esseintes was nearly seventeen.","His mother, a tall, pale, taciturn woman, died of anæmia, and his father of some uncertain malady. Des Esseintes was then seventeen years of age."
"Il assimilait volontiers le magasin d'un horticulteur à un microcosme où étaient représentées toutes les catégories de la société: les fleurs pauvres et canailles, les fleurs de bouge, qui ne sont dans leur vrai milieu que lorsqu'elles reposent sur des rebords de mansardes, les racines tassées dans des boîtes au lait et de vieilles terrines, la giroflée, par exemple; les fleurs prétentieuses, convenues, bêtes, dont la place est seulement dans des cache-pots de porcelaine peints par des jeunes filles, telles que la rose; enfin les fleurs de haute lignée telles que les orchidées, délicates et charmantes, palpitantes et frileuses; les fleurs exotiques, exilées à Paris, au chaud dans des palais de verre; les princesses du règne végétal, vivant à l'écart, n'ayant plus rien de commun avec les plantes de la rue et les flores bourgeoises.","He liked to liken a horticulturist's shop to a microcosm where all categories of society were represented: poor and scoundrel flowers, slum flowers, which are only in their true environment when they rest on the ledges of garrets. , the roots packed in milk cans and old terrines, the wallflower, for example; the pretentious, conventional, stupid flowers, whose place is only in porcelain flowerpots painted by young girls, such as the rose; finally, high-line flowers such as orchids, delicate and charming, throbbing and chilly; exotic flowers, exiled to Paris, warm in glass palaces; the princesses of the plant kingdom, living apart, no longer having anything in common with street plants and bourgeois flora.","It amused him to liken a horticulturist’s shop to a microcosm in which every social category and class was represented – poor, vulgar slum-flowers, the gilliflower for instance, that are really at home only on the window-sill of a garret, with their roots squeezed into milk-cans or old earthenware pots; then pretentious, conventional, stupid flowers such as the rose, whose proper place is in pots concealed inside porcelain vases painted by nice young ladies; and lastly, flowers of charm and tremulous delicacy, exotic flowers exiled to Paris and kept warm in palaces of glass, princesses of the vegetable kingdom, living aloof and apart, having nothing whatever in common with the popular plants or the bourgeois blooms.1","He compared a florist's shop to a microcosm wherein all the categories of society are represented. Here are poor common flowers, the kind found in hovels, which are truly at home only when resting on ledges of garret windows, their roots thrust into milk bottles and old pans, like the gilly-flower for example. And one also finds stupid and pretentious flowers like the rose which belongs in the porcelain flowerpots painted by young girls. Then, there are flowers of noble lineage like the orchid, so delicate and charming, at once cold and palpitating, exotic flowers exiled in the heated glass palaces of Paris, princesses of the vegetable kingdom living in solitude, having absolutely nothing in common with the street plants and other bourgeois flora."
"Celui-ci avait d'abord songé à quelques opales et à quelques hydrophanes; mais ces pierres intéressantes par l'hésitation de leurs couleurs, par le doute de leurs flammes, sont par trop insoumises et infidèles; l'opale a une sensibilité toute rhumatismale; le jeu de ses rayons s'altère suivant l'humidité, la chaleur ou le froid; quant à l'hydrophane elle ne brûle que dans l'eau et ne consent à allumer sa braise grise qu'alors qu'on la mouille.","The latter had first thought of a few opals and a few hydrophanes; but these stones, interesting by the hesitation of their colors, by the doubt of their flames, are too insubordinate and unfaithful; the opal has a quite rheumatic sensibility; the play of its rays is altered according to humidity, heat or cold; as for hydrophane, it only burns in water and only consents to light its gray embers when it is wet.","The latter had originally thought of a border of opals and hydrophanes. But these stones, interesting though they may be on account of their varying colour and vacillating fire, are too unstable and unreliable to be given serious consideration; the opal, in fact, has a positively rheumatic sensitivity, the play of its rays changing in accordance with changes in moisture or temperature, while the hydrophane will burn only in water and refuses to light up its grey fires unless it is wetted.","At first he had thought of some opals and hydrophanes; but these stones, interesting for their hesitating colors, for the evasions of their flames, are too refractory and faithless; the opal has a quite rheumatic sensitiveness; the play of its rays alters according to the humidity, the warmth or cold; as for the hydrophane, it only burns in water and only consents to kindle its embers when moistened."
"Cette forme maintenant considérée comme une forme caduque et gothique de la liturgie chrétienne, comme une curiosité archéologique, comme une relique des anciens temps, c'était le verbe de l'antique église, l'âme du moyen âge; c'était la prière éternelle chantée, modulée suivant les élans de l'âme, l'hymne permanente élancée depuis des siècles vers le Très-Haut.","This form now considered as a decrepit and Gothic form of the Christian liturgy, as an archaeological curiosity, as a relic of ancient times, it was the word of the ancient church, the soul of the Middle Ages; it was the eternal prayer sung, modulated according to the impulses of the soul, the permanent hymn slender for centuries towards the Most High.","This type of music, at present considered an effete and barbarous form of the Christian liturgy, as an archaeological curiosity, as a relic of the distant past, was the idiom of the ancient Church, the very soul of the Middle Ages; it was the sempiternal prayer, sung and modulated to accord with the movements of the soul, the diuturnal hymn which had risen for centuries past towards the Most High.","That form which was now considered a decrepit and Gothic form of Christian liturgy, an archæological curiosity, a relic of ancient time, had been the voice of the early Church, the soul of the Middle Age. It was the eternal prayer that had been sung and modulated in harmony with the soul's transports, the enduring hymn uplifted for centuries to the Almighty."
"Et, sans lui laisser le temps de respirer, il déclara qu'il était allé au plus pressé en rétablissant les fonctions digestives et qu'il fallait maintenant attaquer la névrose qui n'était nullement guérie et nécessiterait des années de régime et de soins. Il ajouta enfin qu'avant de tenter tout remède, avant de commencer tout traitement hydrothérapique, impossible d'ailleurs à suivre à Fontenay, il fallait quitter cette solitude, revenir à Paris, rentrer dans la vie commune, tâcher enfin de se distraire comme les autres.","And, without giving her time to breathe, he declared that he had gone to the most of his hurry by restoring the digestive functions and that it was now necessary to attack the neurosis which was by no means cured and would require years of diet and care. Finally, he added that before attempting any remedy, before beginning any hydrotherapeutic treatment, which, moreover, was impossible to follow at Fontenay, it was necessary to leave this solitude, return to Paris, return to common life, finally try to distract oneself like the others.","Then, without giving him time to breathe, he stated that he had attended to the most urgent problem first by putting right the digestive functions, and that now he must tackle the general nervous trouble, which had not cleared up at all and to do so would require years of strict dieting and careful nursing. He concluded by saying that before trying any particular remedy, before embarking on any sort of hydropathic treatment – which in any case was impracticable at Fontenay – he would have to abandon this solitary existence, to go back to Paris, to lead a normal life again, above all to try and enjoy the same pleasures as other people.","And, without giving him time to catch breath, he informed Des Esseintes that he had done his utmost in re-establishing the digestive functions and that now it was necessary to attack the neurosis which was by no means cured and which would necessitate years of diet and care. He added that before attempting a cure, before commencing any hydrotherapic treatment, impossible of execution at Fontenay, Des Esseintes must quit that solitude, return to Paris, and live an ordinary mode of existence by amusing himself like others."
"Combien de fois des Esseintes n'avait-il pas été saisi et courbé par un irrésistible souffle, alors que le ""Christus factus est"" du chant grégorien s'élevait dans la nef dont les piliers tremblaient parmi les mobiles nuées des encensoirs, ou que le faux-bourdon du ""De profundis"" gémissait, lugubre de même qu'un sanglot contenu, poignant ainsi qu'un appel désespéré de l'humanité pleurant sa destinée mortelle, implorant la miséricorde attendrie de son Sauveur!","How many times had Des Esseintes been seized and bent by an irresistible breeze, while the ""Christus factus est"" of Gregorian chant rose in the nave whose pillars trembled among the moving clouds of the censers, or the drone of ""De profundis"" moaned, mournful as a restrained sob, poignant as a desperate call of humanity mourning its mortal destiny, imploring the tender mercy of its Saviour!","Time and again an awe-struck Des Esseintes had bowed his head in response to an irresistible impulse when the Christus factus est of the Gregorian chant had soared up in the nave, whose pillars trembled amid the floating clouds of incense, or when the faux-bourdon of the De Profundis groaned forth, mournful as a stifled sob, poignant as a despairing appeal by mankind bewailing its mortal destiny and imploring the tender mercy of its Saviour.","How often had Des Esseintes not thrilled under its spell, when the “Christus factus est” of the Gregorian chant rose from the nave whose pillars seemed to tremble among the rolling clouds from censers, or when the “De Profundis” was sung, sad and mournful as a suppressed sob, poignant as a despairing invocation of humanity bewailing its mortal destiny and imploring the tender forgiveness of its Savior!"
"Après avoir perdu depuis si longtemps l'appétit, il demeura confondu devant ces gaillardes dont la voracité aiguisa sa faim. Il commanda un potage oxstail, se régala de cette soupe à la queue de boeuf, tout à la fois onctueuse et veloutée, grasse et ferme; puis, il examina la liste des poissons, demanda un haddock, une sorte de merluche fumée qui lui parut louable et, pris d'une fringale à voir s'empiffrer les autres, il mangea un rosbif aux pommes et s'enfourna deux pintes d'ale, excité par ce petit goût de vacherie musquée que dégage cette fine et pâle bière.","After having lost his appetite for so long, he remained confounded by these galliars whose voracity sharpened his hunger. He ordered an oxtail soup, feasted on this oxtail soup, both unctuous and velvety, fatty and firm; then he examined the list of fish, asked for a haddock, a sort of smoked hake which seemed to him commendable and, seized with a craving to see the others stuffing themselves, he ate a roast beef with apples and stuffed himself with two pints of 'ale, excited by this little taste of musky cowery that this fine and pale beer gives off.","The voracity of these hearty trencherwomen brought back with a rush the appetite he had lost so long ago. First, he ordered and enjoyed some thick, greasy oxtail soup; next, he examined the list of fish and asked for a smoked haddock, which also came up to his expectations; and then, goaded on by the sight of other people guzzling, he ate a huge helping of roast beef and potatoes and downed a couple of pints of ale, savouring the musky cowshed flavour of this fine pale beer.","After having lacked appetite for such a long time, he remained amazed in the presence of these hearty eaters whose voracity whetted his hunger. He ordered oxtail soup and enjoyed it heartily."
"Les uns, élevés avec lui dans les pensions religieuses, avaient gardé de cette éducation une marque spéciale. Ils suivaient les offices, communiaient à Pâques, hantaient les cercles catholiques et ils se cachaient ainsi que d'un crime des assauts qu'ils livraient aux filles, en baissant les yeux. C'étaient, pour la plupart, des bellâtres inintelligents et asservis, de victorieux cancres qui avaient lassé la patience de leurs professeurs, mais avaient néanmoins satisfait à leur volonté de déposer, dans la société, des êtres obéissants et pieux.","Some, brought up with him in religious boarding schools, had retained a special mark from this education. They attended services, took Communion at Easter, haunted Catholic circles and hid themselves like a crime from the assaults they delivered on girls, lowering their eyes. They were, for the most part, unintelligent, enslaved fops, victorious dunces who had exhausted the patience of their teachers, but had nevertheless satisfied their will to deposit obedient and pious beings in society.","Some of them, who like himself had been brought up in religious institutions, had been distinctively marked for life by the education they had received. They went to church regularly, took communion at Easter, frequented Catholic societies and shamefacedly concealed their sexual activities from each other as if they were heinous crimes. For the most part they were docile, good-looking ninnies, congenital dunces who had worn their masters’ patience thin, but had nonetheless satisfied their desire to send pious, obedient creatures out into the world.","One group, educated like himself in religious institutions, preserved the special marks of this training. They attended religious services, received the sacrament on Easter, frequented the Catholic circles and concealed as criminal their amorous escapades. For the most part, they were unintelligent, acquiescent fops, stupid bores who had tried the patience of their professors. Yet these professors were pleased to have bestowed such docile, pious creatures upon society."
"Élancée de la même piste que l'Imitation, cette théorie aboutissait, elle aussi, mais sans s'égarer parmi de mystérieux dédales et d'invraisemblables routes, au même endroit, à la résignation, au laisser-faire.","Leaving the same path as the Imitation, this theory also ended, but without getting lost among mysterious mazes and improbable roads, in the same place, in resignation, in laissez-faire.","Setting off from the same starting-point as the Imitation, but without losing itself in mysterious mazes and unlikely by-paths, this theory reached the same conclusion, an attitude of resignation and drift.","Traversing the same path as the Imitation, this theory, too, ended in similar highways of resignation and indifference, but without going astray in mysterious labyrinths and remote roads."
"Le livre qu'il tenait à la main tombait sur ses genoux; il s'abandonnait, regardant, plein de dégoûts et d'alarmes, défiler les années de sa vie défunte; elles pivotaient, ruisselaient maintenant autour du rappel de madame Laure et d'Auguste, enfoncé, dans ces fluctuations, comme un pieu ferme, comme un fait net. Quelle époque que celle-là! c'était le temps des soirées dans le monde, des courses, des parties de cartes, des amours commandées à l'avance, servies, à l'heure, sur le coup de minuit, dans son boudoir rose! Il se remémorait des figures, des mines, des mots nuls qui l'obsédaient avec cette ténacité des airs vulgaires qu'on ne peut se défendre de fredonner, mais qui finissent par s'épuiser, tout à coup, sans qu'on y pense.","The book he held in his hand fell on his knees; he abandoned himself, watching, full of disgust and alarm, the years of his dead life pass by; they pivoted, streamed now around the recall of Madame Laure and Auguste, sunk in these fluctuations like a firm stake, like a clear fact. What an era that was! it was the time for social evenings, shopping, card parties, love affairs ordered in advance, served on time, at the stroke of midnight, in her pink boudoir! He remembered faces, looks, useless words that obsessed him with the tenacity of vulgar tunes that you can't help humming, but which end up wearing out, suddenly, without you thinking about it. .","The book he happened to be holding would fall into his lap, and he would give himself up to a fearful and disgusted review of his dead life, the years pivoting round the memory of Auguste and Madame Laure as around a solid fact, a stake planted in the midst of swirling waters. What a time that had been! – a time of elegant parties, of race-meetings and card-games, of love-potions ordered in advance and served punctually on the stroke of midnight in his pink boudoir! Faces, looks, meaningless words came back to him with the haunting persistence of those popular tunes you suddenly find yourself humming and just as suddenly and unconsciously you forget.","The book he held in his hands fell to his knees. He abandoned himself to the mood which dominated him, watching the dead years of his life filled with so many disgusts and fears, move past. What a life he had lived! He thought of the evenings spent in society, the horse races, card parties, love affairs ordered in advance and served at the stroke of midnight, in his rose-colored boudoir! He recalled faces, expressions, vain words which obsessed him with the stubbornness of popular melodies which one cannot help humming, but which suddenly and inexplicably end by boring one."
"L'impossibilité de faire monter l'eau à la hauteur où sa maison était perchée, la difficulté même de se procurer de l'eau, en quantité suffisante, dans un village où les fontaines ne fonctionnent parcimonieusement qu'à certaines heures l'arrêtèrent; ne pouvant être sabré par des jets de lance qui plaqués, écrasés sur les anneaux de la colonne vertébrale, étaient seuls assez puissants pour mater l'insomnie et ramener le calme, il fut réduit aux courtes aspersions dans sa baignoire ou dans son tub, aux simples affusions froides, suivies d'énergiques frictions pratiquées, à l'aide du gant de crin, par son domestique.","The impossibility of raising the water to the height where his house was perched, the very difficulty of obtaining water, in sufficient quantity, in a village where the fountains only function sparingly at certain hours, stopped him. ; Unable to be slashed by jets of spears which, squashed, crushed on the rings of the spinal column, were alone powerful enough to subdue insomnia and restore calm, he was reduced to short sprays in his bathtub or in his tub, to simple cold affusions, followed by energetic friction practiced, with the help of the horsehair glove, by his servant.","He had tried to install a set of hydropathic appliances in his dressing-room, but without success: the impossibility of bringing water as high up the hill as his house, not to mention the difficulty of getting water in sufficient quantity in a village where the public fountains only produced a feeble trickle at fixed hours, thwarted this particular plan. Cheated of the jets of water which, shot at close range at the disks of his vertebral column, formed the only treatment capable of overcoming his insomnia and bringing back his peace of mind, he was reduced to brief aspersions in his bath or in his tub, mere cold affusions followed by an energetic rub-down that his valet gave him with a horsehair glove.","But the impossibility of forcing water to the height on which his house was perched, and the difficulty of procuring water even in the village where the fountains functioned sparingly and only at certain hours of the day, caused him to renounce the project. Since he could not have floods of water playing on him from the nozzle of a hose, (the only efficacious means of overcoming his insomnia and calming his nerves through its action on his spinal column) he was reduced to brief sprays or to mere cold baths, followed by energetic massages applied by his servant with the aid of a horse-hair glove."
"La face recueillie, solennelle, presque auguste, elle commence la lubrique danse qui doit réveiller les sens assoupis du vieil Hérode; ses seins ondulent et, au frottement de ses colliers qui tourbillonnent, leurs bouts se dressent; sur la moiteur de sa peau les diamants, attachés, scintillent; ses bracelets, ses ceintures, ses bagues, crachent des étincelles; sur sa robe triomphale, couturée de perles, ramagée d'argent, lamée d'or, la cuirasse des orfèvreries dont chaque maille est une pierre, entre en combustion, croise des serpenteaux de feu, grouille sur la chair mate, sur la peau rose thé, ainsi que des insectes splendides aux élytres éblouissants, marbrés de carmin, ponctués de jaune aurore, diaprés de bleu d'acier, tigrés de vert paon.","Her face recollected, solemn, almost august, she begins the lustful dance which must awaken the slumbering senses of old Herod; her breasts undulating and, at the friction of her swirling collars, their tips stood up; on the moistness of her skin the diamonds, attached, scintillating ; her bracelets, her belts, her rings spit out sparks; on her triumphal dress, sewn with pearls, spangled with silver, lamé with gold, the cuirass of goldsmiths, each mesh of which is a stone, enters into combustion, crosses serpents of fire, swarms over the dark flesh, over the pink skin tea, as well as splendid insects with dazzling elytra, marbled with carmine, punctuated with aurora yellow, variegated with steel blue, striped with peacock green.","With a withdrawn, solemn, almost august expression on her face, she begins the lascivious dance which is to rouse the aged Herod’s dormant senses; her breasts rise and fall, the nipples hardening at the touch of her whirling necklaces; the strings of diamonds glitter against her moist flesh; her bracelets, her belts, her rings all spit out fiery sparks; and across her triumphal robe, sewn with pearls, patterned with silver, spangled with gold, the jewelled cuirass, of which every chain is a precious stone, seems to be ablaze with little snakes of fire, swarming over the mat flesh, over the tea-rose skin, like gorgeous insects with dazzling shards, mottled with carmine, spotted with pale yellow, speckled with steel blue, striped with peacock green.","Her face is meditative, solemn, almost august, as she commences the lascivious dance that will awaken the slumbering senses of old Herod. Diamonds scintillate against her glistening skin. Her bracelets, her girdles, her rings flash. On her triumphal robe, seamed with pearls, flowered with silver and laminated with gold, the breastplate of jewels, each link of which is a precious stone, flashes serpents of fire against the pallid flesh, delicate as a tea-rose: its jewels like splendid insects with dazzling elytra, veined with carmine, dotted with yellow gold, diapered with blue steel, speckled with peacock green."
"Après les fleurs factices singeant les véritables fleurs, il voulait des fleurs naturelles imitant des fleurs fausses.","After fake flowers mimicking real flowers, he wanted natural flowers mimicking fake flowers.","This admirable artistry had long enthralled him, but now he dreamt of collecting another kind of flora: tired of artificial flowers aping real ones, he wanted some natural flowers that would look like fakes.2","Instead of artificial flowers imitating real flowers, natural flowers should mimic the artificial ones."
"Ainsi qu'une odorante antithèse, miss Urania s'imposait fatalement à son souvenir, mais presque aussitôt des Esseintes, heurté par cet imprévu d'un arôme naturel et brut, retournait aux exhalaisons civilisées, et inévitablement il songeait à ses autres maîtresses; elles se pressaient, en troupeau, dans sa cervelle, mais par-dessus toutes s'exhaussait maintenant la femme dont la monstruosité l'avait tant satisfait pendant des mois.","Like a fragrant antithesis, Miss Urania imposed itself fatally on his memory, but almost immediately Des Esseintes, shocked by this unexpectedness of a natural and raw aroma, returned to civilized exhalations, and inevitably he thought of his other mistresses; they thronged like a herd in his brain, but above all now rose the woman whose monstrosity had so satisfied him for months.","With her antithetical fragrance, Miss Urania was bound to take first place in his recollections, but almost immediately Des Esseintes, shaken for a moment by the impact of a natural, unsophisticated aroma, returned to more civilized scents and inevitably started thinking about his other mistresses. These now came crowding in on his memory, but with one woman standing out above the rest: the woman whose monstrous speciality had given him months of wonderful satisfaction.","Miss Urania haunted him by reason of her very difference, but almost instantly, offended by the intrusion of this natural, crude aroma, the antithesis of the scented confection, Des Esseintes returned to more civilized exhalations and his thoughts reverted to his other mistresses. They pressed upon him in a throng; but above them all rose a woman whose startling talents had satisfied him for months."
"- Mon Dieu! mon Dieu! qu'il existe donc peu de livres qu'on puisse relire, soupira des Esseintes, regardant le domestique qui descendait de l'escabelle où il était juché et s'effaçait pour lui permettre d'embrasser d'un coup d'oeil tous les rayons.","- My God! my God! that there are few books one can re-read, sighed Des Esseintes, looking at the servant who came down from the stool where he was perched and moved aside to allow him to take in all the rays.","‘Lord, how few books there are that are worth reading again!’ sighed Des Esseintes, watching his man as he climbed down the step-ladder he had been perched on and stood to one side to let his master have a clear view of all the bookshelves.","“Heavens! heavens! how few books are really worth re-reading,” sighed Des Esseintes, gazing at the servant who left the stool on which he had been perched, to permit Des Esseintes to survey his books with a single glance."
"Avec cela, elle avait une retenue puritaine, au lit et aucune de ces brutalités d'athlète qu'il souhaitait tout en les craignant; elle n'était pas sujette comme il en avait, un moment, conçu l'espoir, aux perturbations de son sexe. En sondant bien le vide de ses convoitises, peut-être eût-il cependant aperçu un penchant vers un être délicat et fluet, vers un tempérament absolument contraire au sien, mais alors il eût découvert une préférence non pour une fillette, mais pour un joyeux gringalet, pour un cocasse et maigre clown.","With that, she had a puritanical restraint, in bed and none of that athletic brutality he desired while fearing it; she was not subject, as he had for a moment hoped, to the disturbances of her sex. By sounding out the emptiness of his desires, perhaps he would nevertheless have perceived a penchant for a delicate and slender being, for a temperament absolutely contrary to his own, but then he would have discovered a preference not for a little girl, but for a cheerful weakling, for a comical and skinny clown.","What is more, she was positively puritanical in bed and treated Des Esseintes to none of those rough, athletic caresses he at once desired and dreaded; she was not subject, as he had for a moment hoped she might be, to sexual fluctuations. Perhaps, if he had probed deep into her unfeeling nature, he might yet have discovered a penchant for some delicate, slightly built bedfellow with a temperament diametrically opposed to her own; but in that case it would have been a preference, not for a young girl, but for a merry little shrimp of a man, a spindle-shanked, funny-faced clown.","Furthermore, she was withdrawn and puritanical in her embraces, displaying none of the brute force he had dreaded yet longed for, and she was subject to none of the perturbations of his sex."
"Cependant quelques écrivains existaient dont l'ardente éloquence fondait et tordait cette langue, Lacordaire surtout, l'un des seuls écrivains qu'ait, depuis des années, produits l'église.","However, there were a few writers whose ardent eloquence melted and twisted this language, especially Lacordaire, one of the only writers the Church had produced for years.","Yet there were one or two authors whose burning eloquence somehow succeeded in melting and moulding this petrified language, and the foremost of these was Lacordaire, one of the few genuine writers the Church had produced in a great many years.","Yet, despite all this, there were several writers whose burning eloquence fused and shaped this language, notably Lacordaire, who was one of the few really great writers the Church had produced for many years."
"Il se rendit dans son cabinet de toilette. Là, près d'un ancien baptistère qui lui servait de cuvette, sous une longue glace en fer forgé, emprisonnant ainsi que d'une margelle argentée de lune, l'eau verte et comme morte du miroir, des bouteilles de toute grandeur, de toute forme, s'étageaient sur des rayons d'ivoire.","He went to his bathroom. There, near an old baptistery which served as a basin, under a long wrought iron mirror, imprisoning like a rim silvered with the moon, the green and as if dead water of the mirror, bottles of all sizes, any form, were layered on ivory shelves.","He went into his dressing-room. There, beside an ancient font that he used as a wash-basin, and under a long looking-glass in a wrought-iron frame that held the mirror imprisoned like still green water inside the moon-silvered curb-stone of a well, bottles of all shapes and sizes were ranged in rows on ivory shelves.","He betook himself to his dressing room. There, near an old baptistery which he used as a wash basin, under a long mirror of forged iron, which, like the edge of a well silvered by the moon, confined the green dull surface of the mirror, were bottles of every conceivable size and form, placed on ivory shelves."
"Des associations d'idées se formaient dans l'esprit de des Esseintes qui arrivait à une conclusion, maintenant qu'il embrassait par le souvenir, à vol d'oiseau, ces tas d'estaminets et de rues.","Associations of ideas were forming in the mind of Des Esseintes, who was coming to a conclusion, now that he was embracing in memory, as the crow flies, these heaps of estaminets and streets.","Ideas began to link up in Des Esseintes’s mind, and he found himself coming to a definite conclusion, now that his memory had provided him, so to speak, with a bird’s-eye view of these crowded taverns and streets.","Certain ideas associated themselves in the mind of Des Esseintes, whose reveries came to an end, now that he recalled this collection of coffee-houses and streets."
"Son admiration pour cet écrivain était sans borne. Selon lui, en littérature, on s'était jusqu'alors borné à explorer les superficies de l'âme ou à pénétrer dans ses souterrains accessibles et éclairés, relevant, çà et là, les gisements des péchés capitaux, étudiant leurs, filons, leur croissance, notant, ainsi que Balzac, par exemple, les stratifications de l'âme possédée par la monomanie d'une passion, par l'ambition, par l'avarice, par la bêtise paternelle, par l'amour sénile.","His admiration for this writer was boundless. According to him, in literature, we had hitherto been limited to exploring the surfaces of the soul or to penetrating into its accessible and enlightened subterraneans, noting, here and there, the deposits of capital sins, studying their veins, their growth, noting, like Balzac, for example, the stratifications of the soul possessed by the monomania of a passion, by ambition, by avarice, by paternal stupidity, by senile love.","His admiration for this author knew no bounds. In his opinion, writers had hitherto confined themselves to exploring the surface of the soul, or such underground passages as were easily accessible and well lit, measuring here and there the deposits of the seven deadly sins, studying the lie of the lodes and their development, recording for instance, as Balzac did, the stratification of a soul possessed by some monomaniacal passion – ambition or avarice, paternal love or senile lust.","His admiration for this writer was unqualified. According to him, until Baudelaire's advent in literature, writers had limited themselves to exploring the surfaces of the soul or to penetrating into the accessible and illuminated caverns, restoring here and there the layers of capital sins, studying their veins, their growths, and noting, like Balzac for example, the layers of strata in the soul possessed by the monomania of a passion, by ambition, by avarice, by paternal stupidity, or by senile love."
"À n'en pas douter, cette sempiternelle radoteuse a maintenant usé la débonnaire admiration des vrais artistes, et le moment est venu où il s'agit de la remplacer, autant que faire se pourra, par l'artifice.","Undoubtedly, this sempiternal rambling has now worn down the debonair admiration of true artists, and the time has come when it is a question of replacing it, as far as possible, by artifice.","There can be no shadow of doubt that with her never-ending platitudes the old crone has by now exhausted the good-humoured admiration of all true artists, and the time has surely come for artifice to take her place whenever possible.","There can be no doubt about it: this eternal, driveling, old woman is no longer admired by true artists, and the moment has come to replace her by artifice."
"Une fois au boulevard d'Enfer, dans la rue, il héla un cocher, jouissant à être ainsi empêtré avec ses malles et ses couvertures. Moyennant la promesse d'un copieux pourboire, il s'entendit avec l'homme au pantalon noisette et au gilet rouge: - à l'heure, fit-il, et, rue de Rivoli, vous vous arrêterez devant le Galignani's Messenger; car il songeait à acheter, avant son départ, un guide Baedeker ou Murray, de Londres.","Once at the Boulevard d'Enfer, in the street, he hailed a coachman, enjoying being thus entangled with his trunks and his blankets. In exchange for the promise of a copious tip, he came to an agreement with the man in the brown trousers and the red waistcoat: - on time, he said, and, in the rue de Rivoli, you will stop in front of Galignani's Messenger; for he thought of buying, before his departure, a Baedeker or Murray guide from London.","Once out in the street, on the Boulevard d’Enfer, he hailed a cab, rather enjoying the sensation of being cluttered up with trunks and travelling-rugs. The cabby, resplendent in nut-brown trousers and scarlet waistcoat, was promised a generous tip, and this helped the two men to reach a speedy understanding. ‘You’ll be paid by the hour,’ said Des Esseintes; and then, remembering that he wanted to buy a copy of Baedeker’s or Murray’s Guide to London, he added: ‘When you get to the Rue de Rivoli, stop outside Galignani’s Messenger.","Once in the boulevard d'Enfer, he hailed a coachman. In some strange manner he extracted a pleasure from the fact that he was so hampered with trunks and rugs. By promising a substantial tip, he reached an understanding with the man of the brown trousers and red waistcoat. “At once!” he commanded. “And when you reach the rue de Rivoli, stop in front of Galignani's Messenger.” Before departing, he desired to buy a Baedeker or Murray guide of London."
"Il pensa qu'il ferait bien de se défier d'elle, regretta presque d'avoir admis parmi les plantes inodores qu'il possédait, cette orchidée qui fleurait les plus désagréables des souvenirs.","He thought he would do well to be wary of her, almost regretted having admitted among the odorless plants he owned, this orchid which smelled of the most disagreeable of memories.","He decided he had better be wary of it, and almost regretted having admitted among all the scentless plants he possessed this orchid with its unpleasantly reminiscent odour.","He felt that he would do well to mistrust it and he almost regretted having admitted, among the scentless plants, this orchid which evoked the most disagreeable memories."
"Il lisait ou rêvait, s'abreuvait jusqu'à la nuit de solitude ; à force de méditer sur les mêmes pensées, son esprit se concentra et ses idées encore indécises mûrirent. Après chaque vacance, il revenait chez ses maîtres plus réfléchi et plus têtu ; ces changements ne leur échappaient pas ; perspicaces et retors, habitués par leur métier à sonder jusqu'au plus profond des âmes, ils ne furent point les dupes de cette intelligence éveillée mais indocile ; ils comprirent que jamais cet élève ne contribuerait à la gloire de leur maison, et comme sa famille était riche et paraissait se désintéresser de son avenir, ils renoncèrent aussitôt à le diriger sur les profitables carrières des écoles ; bien qu'il discutât volontiers avec eux sur toutes les doctrines théologiques qui le sollicitaient par leurs subtilités et leurs arguties, ils ne songèrent même pas à le destiner aux Ordres, car malgré leurs efforts sa foi demeurait débile ; en dernier ressort, par prudence, par peur de l'inconnu, ils le laissèrent travailler aux études qui lui plaisaient et négliger les autres, ne voulant pas s'aliéner cet esprit indépendant, par des tracasseries de pions laïques.","He read or dreamed, drinking water until the night of solitude; by dint of meditating on the same thoughts, his mind became concentrated and his still undecided ideas matured. After each vacation, he returned to his masters more thoughtful and more obstinate; these changes did not escape them; shrewd and devious, accustomed by their profession to sounding the depths of souls, they were not the dupes of this awakened but intractable intelligence; they understood that this pupil would never contribute to the glory of their house, and as his family was rich and seemed to be disinterested in his future, they immediately gave up directing him to the profitable careers of the schools; although he willingly discussed with them all the theological doctrines which solicited him by their subtleties and their quibbles, they did not even think of desiring him to the Orders, because in spite of their efforts his faith remained feeble; as a last resort, out of prudence, out of fear of the unknown, they let him work on the studies he liked and neglect the others, not wanting to alienate this independent spirit by the harassment of lay pawns.","He would spend hours reading or daydreaming, enjoying his fill of solitude until night fell; and by dint of pondering the same thoughts his intelligence grew sharper and his ideas gained in maturity and precision. At the end of every vacation he went back to his masters a more serious and a more stubborn boy. These changes did not escape their notice: shrewd and clearsighted men, accustomed by their profession to probing the inmost recesses of the human soul, they treated this lively but intractable mind with caution and reserve. They realized that this particular pupil of theirs would never do anything to add to the glory of their house; and as his family was rich and apparently uninterested in his future, they soon gave up any idea of turning his thoughts towards the profitable careers open to their successful scholars. Similarly, although he was fond of engaging with them in argument about theological doctrines whose niceties and subtleties intrigued him, they never even thought of inducing him to enter a religious order, for in spite of all their efforts his faith remained infirm. Finally, out of prudence and fear of the unknown, they let him pursue whatever studies pleased him and neglect the rest, not wishing to turn this independent spirit against them by subjecting him to the sort of irksome discipline imposed by lay tutors.","Immersed in solitude, he would dream or read far into the night. By protracted contemplation of the same thoughts, his mind grew sharp, his vague, undeveloped ideas took on form. After each vacation, Jean returned to his masters more reflective and headstrong. These changes did not escape them. Subtle and observant, accustomed by their profession to plumb souls to their depths, they were fully aware of his unresponsiveness to their teachings. They knew that this student would never contribute to the glory of their order, and as his family was rich and apparently careless of his future, they soon renounced the idea of having him take up any of the professions their school offered. Although he willingly discussed with them those theological doctrines which intrigued his fancy by their subtleties and hair-splittings, they did not even think of training him for the religious orders, since, in spite of their efforts, his faith remained languid. As a last resort, through prudence and fear of the harm he might effect, they permitted him to pursue whatever studies pleased him and to neglect the others, being loath to antagonize this bold and independent spirit by the quibblings of the lay school assistants."
"Et cependant, lorsqu'il était dans ces dispositions d'esprit, toute littérature lui semblait fade après ces terribles philtres importés de l'Amérique. Alors, il s'adressait à Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, dans l'oeuvre éparse duquel il notait des observations encore séditieuses, des vibrations encore spasmodiques, mais qui ne dardaient plus, à l'exception de sa Claire Lenoir du moins, une si bouleversante horreur.","And yet, when he was in such a state of mind, all literature seemed to him insipid after those terrible philtres imported from America. So he addressed himself to Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, in whose scattered work he noted still seditious observations, still spasmodic vibrations, but which no longer darted, with the exception of his Claire Lenoir at least, such overwhelming horror.","And yet, when he was in this frame of mind, almost anything he read seemed insipid after these terrible philtres imported from America. He would therefore turn to Villiers de I’Isle-Adam,14 in whose scattered writings he discovered observations just as unorthodox, vibrations just as spasmodic, but which, except perhaps in Claire Lenoir, did not convey such an overwhelming sense of horror.","And yet, when he felt inclined to read, all literature seemed to him dull after these terrible American imported philtres. Then he betook himself to Villiers de L'Isle Adam in whose scattered works he noted seditious observations and spasmodic vibrations, but which no longer gave one, with the exception of his Claire Lenoir, such troubling horror."
"Malgré tout, cette attente d'un soulagement le ravitaillait, mais il eut une appréhension nouvelle: pourvu que le médecin soit à Paris et qu'il veuille se déranger, et aussitôt la peur que son domestique ne l'eût pas rencontré, l'atterra. Il recommençait à défaillir, sautant, d'une seconde à l'autre, de l'espoir le plus insensé aux transes les plus folles, s'exagérant et ses chances de soudaine guérison et ses craintes de prompt danger; les heures s'écoulèrent et le moment vint où, désespéré, à bout de force, convaincu que décidément le médecin n'arriverait pas, il se répéta rageusement que, s'il avait été secouru à temps, il eût été certainement sauvé; puis sa colère contre le domestique, contre le médecin qu'il accusait de le laisser mourir, s'évanouit, et enfin il s'irrita contre lui-même, se reprochant d'avoir attendu aussi longtemps pour requérir un aide, se persuadant qu'il serait actuellement guéri s'il avait, depuis la veille seulement, réclamé des médicaments vigoureux et des soins utiles.","Despite everything, this expectation of relief fueled him, but he had a new apprehension: provided that the doctor was in Paris and that he wanted to disturb himself, and immediately the fear that his servant had not met him, the land. He began to faint again, jumping, from one second to the next, from the wildest hope to the wildest trances, exaggerating his chances of sudden recovery and his fears of imminent danger; the hours passed and the moment came when, in despair, at the end of his tether, convinced that the doctor would definitely not arrive, he repeated to himself furiously that, if he had been helped in time, he would certainly have been saved; then his anger against the servant, against the doctor whom he accused of letting him die, vanished, and finally he became irritated against himself, reproaching himself for having waited so long to call for help, convincing himself that He would actually be cured if he had, only since the day before, asked for vigorous medicines and useful care.","In spite of everything, the prospect of obtaining some relief put new heart into him, but then fresh anxieties assailed him: perhaps the doctor was not in Paris, perhaps he would refuse to come and see him, perhaps his servant had not even succeeded in finding him. He began to lose heart again, jumping, from one minute to the next, from the most unreasonable hopefulness to the most illogical apprehension, exaggerating both his chances of sudden recovery and his fears of immediate danger. The hours slipped by and eventually, exhausted and in despair, convinced that the doctor would never come, he angrily told himself over and over again that if only he had been seen to in time he would undoubtedly have been saved. Then his anger at his servant’s inefficiency and his doctor’s callousness in apparently letting him die abated, and he finally took to blaming himself for having waited so long before sending for help, persuading himself that by now he would have been completely fit if, even the day before, he had insisted on having potent medicines and skilled attention.","In spite of everything, this expectation of being cured cheered him, but then a new fear entered. His servant might have failed to find the physician. Again he grew faint, passing instantly from the most unreasoning hopes to the most baseless fears, exaggerating the chances of a sudden recovery and his apprehensions of danger. The hours passed and the moment came when, in utter despair and convinced that the physician would not arrive, he angrily told himself that he certainly would have been saved, had he acted sooner. Then his rage against the servant and the physician whom he accused of permitting him to die, vanished, and he ended by reproaching himself for having waited so long before seeking aid, persuading himself that he would now be wholly cured had he that very last evening used the medicine."
"Entre tous, un artiste existait dont le talent le ravissait en de longs transports, Gustave Moreau.","Among all, there was an artist whose talent delighted him in long transports, Gustave Moreau.","Among all the artists he considered, there was one who sent him into raptures of delight, and that was Gustave Moreau.",Among these were some executed by an artist whose genius allured and entranced him: Gustave Moreau.
"Une fois de plus, cette solitude si ardemment enviée et enfin acquise, avait abouti à une détresse affreuse; ce silence qui lui était autrefois apparu comme une compensation des sottises écoutées pendant des ans, lui pesait maintenant d'un poids insoutenable. Un matin, il s'était réveillé, agité ainsi qu'un prisonnier mis en cellule; ses lèvres énervées remuaient pour articuler des sons, des larmes lui montaient aux yeux, il étouffait de même qu'un homme qui aurait sangloté pendant des heures.","Once more, this solitude so ardently envied and finally acquired, had resulted in a frightful distress; this silence which had formerly appeared to him as a compensation for the nonsense he had listened to for years, now weighed on him with an unbearable weight. One morning he woke up, agitated like a prisoner put in a cell; his angry lips moved to articulate sounds, tears welled up in his eyes, he was choking like a man who had sobbed for hours.","Once again, he told himself, the solitude he had longed for so ardently and finally obtained had resulted in appalling unhappiness, while the silence which he had once regarded as well-merited compensation for the nonsense he had listened to for years now weighed unbearably upon him. One morning, he had woken up feeling as desperate as a man who finds himself locked in a prison cell; his lips trembled when he tried to speak, his eyes filled with tears and he choked and spluttered like someone who has been weeping for hours.","Once more, this so ardently desired and finally attained solitude had ended in a fearful distress. This silence which formerly would have appeared as a compensation for the stupidities heard for years, now weighed on him with an unendurable burden.

Les femmes ouvrirent de grands yeux.,The women opened their eyes wide.,The woman gazed at him with open-eyed amazement.,"Although he experienced no inclination for the state of grace, he felt a genuine sympathy for those souls immured in monasteries, persecuted by a vengeful society which can forgive neither the merited scorn with which it inspires them, nor the desire to expiate, to atone by long silences, for the ever growing shamelessness of its ridiculous or trifling gossipings."
"En art, ses idées étaient pourtant parties d'un point de vue simple; pour lui, les écoles n'existaient point; seul le tempérament de l'écrivain importait; seul le travail de sa cervelle intéressait, quel que fût le sujet qu'il abordât. Malheureusement, cette vérité d'appréciation, digne de La Palisse, était à peu près inapplicable, par ce simple motif que, tout en désirant se dégager des préjugés, s'abstenir de toute passion, chacun va de préférence aux oeuvres qui correspondent le plus intimement à son propre tempérament et finit par reléguer en arrière toutes les autres.","In art, however, his ideas had started from a simple point of view; for him, schools did not exist; only the temperament of the writer mattered; only the work of his brain interested him, whatever the subject he broached. Unfortunately, this truth of appreciation, worthy of La Palisse, was almost inapplicable, for the simple reason that, while wishing to get rid of prejudices, to abstain from all passion, each goes in preference to the works which correspond most intimately to his own temperament and ends up relegating all the others to the rear.","Yet his literary opinions had started from a very simple point of view. For him, there were no such things as schools;1 the only thing that mattered to him was the writer’s personality, and the only thing that interested him was the working of the writer’s brain, no matter what subject he was tackling. Unfortunately this criterion of appreciation, so obviously just, was practically impossible to apply, for the simple reason that, however much a reader wants to rid himself of prejudice and refrain from passion, he naturally prefers those works which correspond most intimately with his own personality, and ends by relegating all the rest to limbo.","In art, his ideas had sprung from a simple point of view. For him schools did not exist, and only the temperament of the writer mattered, only the working of his brain interested him, regardless of the subject.

"L'affreux regard s'attachait à des Esseintes, le pénétrait le glaçait jusqu'aux moelles - plus affolée encore, la femme bouledogue se serra contre lui et hurla à la mort, la tête renversée sur son cou roide.","The hideous gaze attached to Des Esseintes, penetrated him, froze him to the very marrow. Even more terrified, the bulldog woman pressed herself against him and howled to death, her head thrown back on her stiff neck.","Its awful gaze was fixed on Des Esseintes, piercing him, freezing him to the marrow, while the bulldog woman, even more terrified than he was, clung to him and howled blue murder, her head thrown back and her neck rigid.","The ghastly eyes were fixed on Des Esseintes, penetrating him, freezing his very marrow; wilder than ever, the bulldog woman threw herself at him and commenced to howl like a dog at the killing, her head hanging on her rigid neck."
"Durant les jours qui suivirent son retour, des Esseintes considéra ses livres, et à la pensée qu'il aurait pu se séparer d'eux pendant longtemps, il goûta une satisfaction aussi effective que celle dont il eût joui s'il les avait retrouvés, après une sérieuse absence. Sous l'impulsion de ce sentiment, ces objets lui semblèrent nouveaux, car il perçut en eux des beautés oubliées depuis l'époque où il les avait acquis.","During the days which followed his return, Des Esseintes considered his books, and at the thought that he could have parted with them for a long time, he tasted a satisfaction as effective as that which he would have enjoyed if he had found them again. after a serious absence.

Under the impulse of this feeling, he saw them in a new light, discovering beauties in them he had forgotten ever since he had bought and read them for the first time.","During the days following his return, Des Esseintes contemplated his books and experienced, at the thought that he might have been separated from them for a long period, a satisfaction as complete as that which comes after a protracted absence.

"Ces principes une fois admis, il était parvenu, grâce à d'érudites expériences, à se jouer sur la langue de silencieuses mélodies, de muettes marches funèbres à grand spectacle, à entendre, dans sa bouche, des solis de menthe, des duos de vespétro et de rhum.","These principles once accepted, he had succeeded, thanks to erudite experiments, in playing on his tongue silent melodies, mute funeral marches with great spectacle, in hearing, in his mouth, mint solos, duets of vespetro and rum.","Once these principles had been established, and thanks to a series of erudite experiments, he had been able to perform upon his tongue silent melodies and mute funeral marches; to hear inside his mouth crème-de-menthe solos and rum-and-vespetro duets.","These principles once admitted, he succeeded, after numerous experiments, in enjoying silent melodies on his tongue, mute funeral marches, in hearing, in his mouth, solos of mint, duos of ratafia and rum."
"Des Esseintes reposa sur la table L'Après-midi du faune, et il feuilleta une autre plaquette qu'il avait fait imprimer, à son usage, une anthologie du poème en prose, une petite chapelle, placée sous l'invocation de Baudelaire, et ouverte sur le parvis de ses poèmes.","Des Esseintes put L'Après-midi du faune on the table, and he leafed through another booklet which he had had printed, for his own use, an anthology of the poem in prose, a small chapel, placed under the invocation of Baudelaire, and open to the forecourt of his poems.","Des Esseintes put L’Après-midi d’un faune back on the table and began glancing through another slim volume which he had had printed for his personal pleasure – an anthology of prose poetry, a little chapel dedicated to Baudelaire and opening on to the cathedral square of his poems.","Des Esseintes placed l'Après-midi du faune on the table and examined another little book he had printed, an anthology of prose poems, a tiny chapel, placed under the invocation of Baudelaire and opening on the parvise of his poems."
"Mais, en mettant même de côté les bienfaits de cet air fardé qui paraissait transfuser un nouveau sang sous les peaux défraîchies et usées par l'habitude des céruses et l'abus des nuits, il goûtait pour son propre compte, dans ce languissant milieu, des allégresses particulières, des plaisirs que rendaient extrêmes et qu'activaient, en quelque sorte, les souvenirs des maux passés, des ennuis défunts.","But, even putting aside the benefits of this painted air which seemed to transfuse new blood under the skins faded and worn by the habit of whitewash and the abuse of the nights, he tasted for his own account, in this languid environment, special delights, pleasures rendered extreme and activated, in a way, by the memories of past ills, of defunct annoyances.","But quite apart from the beneficial effect which this tinted atmosphere had in bringing a ruddy flush to complexions worn and discoloured by the habitual use of cosmetics and the habitual abuse of the night hours, he himself enjoyed, in this voluptuous setting, peculiar satisfactions – pleasures which were in a way heightened and intensified by the recollection of past afflictions and bygone troubles.","Aside from the sensual delights for which he had designed this chamber, this painted atmosphere which gave new color to faces grown dull and withered by the use of ceruse and by nights of dissipation, there were other, more personal and perverse pleasures which he enjoyed in these languorous surroundings,—pleasures which in some way stimulated memories of his past pains and dead ennuis."

"En tête du défilé des maîtresses que la saveur de ce bonbon aidait à dessiner en des traits certains, l'une s'arrêta, montrant des dents longues et blanches, une peau satinée, toute rose, un nez taillé en biseau, des yeux de souris, des cheveux coupés à la chien et blonds.","At the head of the procession of mistresses whom the flavor of this candy helped to draw in certain features, one stopped, showing long and white teeth, a satiny skin, all pink, a bevelled nose, eyes of mouse, hair cut in the dog and blond.","Heading the procession of mistresses that the taste of the bonbon helped to define in detail was a woman who paused in front of him, a woman with long white teeth, a sharp nose, mouse-coloured eyes and short-cropped yellow hair.","At the head of the procession of mistresses whom the fragrance of the bonbons helped to place in bold relief, one paused, displaying long white teeth, a satiny rose skin, a snub nose, mouse-colored eyes, and close-cropped blond hair."
"Ces souvenirs l'égayèrent un peu; il examina le jardin, s'intéressant aux plantes flétries par la chaleur, et aux terres ardentes qui fumaient dans la pulvérulence embrasée de l'air; puis, au-dessus de la haie séparant le jardin en contrebas de la route surélevée montant au fort, il aperçut des gamins qui se roulaient, en plein soleil, dans la lumière.","These memories cheered him up a little; he surveyed the garden, taking an interest in the plants withered by the heat, and in the burning earth which smoked in the fiery dustiness of the air; then, above the hedge separating the garden below from the raised road leading up to the fort, he saw children rolling around, in the full sun, in the light.","These recollections cheered him up somewhat, and he began looking round the garden, examining the plants that had been withered by the heat and noticing how the baked earth was smoking under the scorching, dusty rays of the sun. Then, over the hedge separating the low-lying garden from the raised roadway going up to the Fort, he caught sight of a bunch of boys rolling about on the ground in the blazing sunshine.","He examined the garden, interesting himself in the plants withered by the heat, and in the hot ground whose vapors rose into the dusty air.

"Peut-être aussi qu'en armant son énigmatique déesse du lotus vénéré, le peintre avait songé à la danseuse, à la femme mortelle, au Vase souillé, cause de tous les péchés et de tous les crimes; peut-être s'était-il souvenu des rites de la vieille égypte, des cérémonies sépulcrales de l'embaumement, alors que les chimistes et les prêtres étendent le cadavre de la morte sur un banc de jaspe, lui tirent avec des aiguilles courbes la cervelle par les fosses du nez, les entrailles par l'incision pratiquée dans son flanc gauche, puis avant de lui dorer les ongles et les dents, avant de l'enduire de bitumes et d'essences, lui insèrent, dans les parties sexuelles, pour les purifier, les chastes pétales de la divine fleur.","Perhaps also that in arming his enigmatic goddess with the venerated lotus, the painter had thought of the dancer, of the mortal woman, of the Defiled Vase, the cause of all sins and all crimes; perhaps he had remembered the rites of old Egypt, the sepulchral ceremonies of embalming, when chemists and priests spread the corpse of the dead on a bench of jasper, pull it with curved needles brain through the pits of the nose, the entrails through the incision made in his left flank, then before gilding his nails and teeth, before coating him with bitumen and essences, insert him, in the sexual parts, to purify them, the chaste petals of the divine flower.","Perhaps, too, in arming his enigmatic goddess with the revered lotus-blossom, the painter had been thinking of the dancer, the mortal woman, the soiled vessel, ultimate cause of every sin and every crime; perhaps he had remembered the sepulchral rites of ancient Egypt, the solemn ceremonies of embalmment, when practitioners and priests lay out the dead woman’s body on a slab of jasper, then with curved needles extract her brains through the nostrils, her entrails through an opening made in the left side, and finally, before gilding her nails and her teeth, before anointing the corpse with oils and spices, insert into her sexual parts, to purify them, the chaste petals of the divine flower.","Perhaps, too, in arming his enigmatic goddess with the venerated lotus, the painter had dreamed of the dancer, the mortal woman with the polluted Vase, from whom spring all sins and crimes. Perhaps he had recalled the rites of ancient Egypt, the sepulchral ceremonies of the embalming when, after stretching the corpse on a bench of jasper, extracting the brain with curved needles through the chambers of the nose, the chemists and the priests, before gilding the nails and teeth and coating the body with bitumens and essences, inserted the chaste petals of the divine flower in the sexual parts, to purify them."
"Ses idées de se blottir, loin du monde, de se calfeutrer dans une retraite, d'assourdir, ainsi que pour ces malades dont on couvre la rue de paille, le vacarme roulant de l'inflexible vie, se renforcèrent.","His ideas of snuggling up, far from the world, of hiding in a retreat, of deafening, as for those sick people whose streets are covered with straw, the rolling din of inflexible life, grew stronger.","The idea of hiding away far from human society, of shutting himself up in some snug retreat, of deadening the thunderous din of life’s inexorable activity, just as people deadened the noise of traffic by laying down straw outside a sick person’s house – this idea tempted him more than ever.","Once more he was toying with the idea of becoming a recluse, of living in some hushed retreat where the turmoil of life would be muffled—as in those streets covered with straw to prevent any sound from reaching invalids."
"Mais, dans le tempérament de Villiers, un autre coin, bien autrement perçant, bien autrement net, existait, un coin de plaisanterie noire et de raillerie féroce; ce n'étaient plus alors les paradoxales mystifications d'Edgar Poe, c'était un bafouage d'un comique lugubre, tel qu'en ragea Swift. Une série de pièces, Les Demoiselles de Bienfilâtre, L'Affichage céleste, La Machine à gloire, Le Plus beau dîner du monde, décelaient un esprit de goguenardise singulièrement inventif et âcre. Toute l'ordure des idées utilitaires contemporaines, toute l'ignominie mercantile du siècle, étaient glorifiées en des pièces dont la poignante ironie transportait des Esseintes.","But, in the character of Villiers, another corner, much more piercing, much more clear, existed, a corner of dark jokes and ferocious raillery; it was no longer the paradoxical mystifications of Edgar Poe, it was a mockery of a lugubrious comedy, such as Swift raged. A series of plays, Les Demoiselles de Bienfilâtre, L'Afichage celeste, La Machine aglorie, Le Plus beau diner du monde, betrayed a singularly inventive and acrid spirit of mockery. All the filth of contemporary utilitarian ideas, all the mercantile ignominy of the century, were glorified in plays whose poignant irony transported Des Esseintes.","But there was another side to Villiers’ personality, altogether clearer and sharper, marked by grim humour and ferocious banter; when this side was uppermost, the result was not one of Poe’s paradoxical mystifications, but a lugubriously comic jeering similar to Swift’s bitter raillery. A whole series of tales, Les Demoiselles de Bienfilâtre, L’Affichage céleste, La Machine à gloire and Le plus beau dîner du monde, revealed a singularly inventive and satirical sense of humour. All the filthiness of contemporary utilitarian ideas, all the money-grubbing ignominy of the age were glorified in stories whose pungent irony sent Des Esseintes into raptures of delight.","But there was another side to Villiers' temperament. It was piercing and acute in an altogether different sense—a side of forbidding pleasantry and fierce raillery. No longer was it the paradoxical mystifications of Poe, but a scoffing that had in it the lugubrious and savage comedy which Swift possessed. A series of sketches, les Demoiselles de Bienfilâtre, l'Affichage céleste, la Machine à gloire, and le Plus beau dîner du monde, betrayed a singularly inventive and keenly bantering mind. The whole order of contemporary and utilitarian ideas, the whole commercialized baseness of the age were glorified in stories whose poignant irony transported Des Esseintes."
"Il referma la croisée; ce brusque passage sans transition, de la chaleur torride, aux frimas du plein hiver l'avait saisi; il se recroquevilla près du feu et l'idée lui vint d'avaler un spiritueux qui le réchauffât.",He closed the window; this abrupt transition without transition from the torrid heat to the frosts of midwinter had gripped him; he curled up near the fire and the idea occurred to him to swallow a spirit that would warm him up.,"He shut the window again. This quick change, straight from the torrid heat of the room to the biting cold of mid-winter had taken his breath away; and curling up beside the fire again, it occurred to him that a drop of spirits would be the best thing to warm him up.",He closed the window. This abrupt transition from torrid warmth to cold winter affected him. He crouched near the fire and it occurred to him that he needed a cordial to revive his flagging spirits.
"Assis maintenant, dans son cabinet de toilette, devant sa table, il songeait à créer un nouveau bouquet et il était pris de ce moment d'hésitation bien connu des écrivains, qui, après des mois de repos, s'apprêtent à recommencer une nouvelle oeuvre.","Seated now, in his dressing room, in front of his table, he thought of creating a new bouquet and he was seized by that moment of hesitation well known to writers, who, after months of rest, prepare to start a new one. work.","Sitting now at his dressing-room table, he was toying with the idea of creating a new bouquet when he was afflicted with that sudden hesitation so familiar to writers who, after months of idleness, make ready to embark on a new work.","Now, seated in his dressing room in front of his table, he thought of creating a new bouquet; and he was overcome by that moment of wavering confidence familiar to writers when, after months of inaction, they prepare for a new work."
"Il n'y avait, selon lui, que deux manières d'organiser une chambre à coucher: ou bien en faire une excitante alcôve, un lieu de délectation nocturne; ou bien agencer un lieu de solitude et de repos, un retrait de pensées, une espèce d'oratoire.","There were, according to him, only two ways to organize a bedroom: either to make it an exciting alcove, a place of nocturnal delight; or arrange a place of solitude and rest, a retreat from thoughts, a kind of oratory.","There were, in his opinion, only two ways of arranging a bedroom: you could either make it a place for sensual pleasure, for nocturnal delectation, or else you could fit it out as a place for sleep and solitude, a setting for quiet meditation, a sort of oratory.","According to him, there were but two ways of fitting a bedroom. One could either make it a sense-stimulating alcove, a place for nocturnal delights, or a cell for solitude and repose, a retreat for thought, a sort of oratory."
"Il interrompit sa lecture, rumina loin de la bégueule Angleterre, sur les peccadilles libertines, sur les salaces apprêts que l'église désapprouve; une commotion le frappa; l'anaphrodisie de sa cervelle et de son corps qu'il avait crue définitive, se dissipa; la solitude agit encore sur le détraquement de ses nerfs; il fut une fois de plus obsédé non par la religion même, mais par la malice des actes et des péchés qu'elle condamne; l'habituel sujet de ses obsécrations et de ses menaces le tint seul; le côté charnel, insensible depuis des mois, remué tout d'abord, par l'énervement des lectures pieuses, puis réveillé, mis debout, dans une crise de névrose, par le cant anglais; se dressa et la stimulation de ses sens le reportant en arrière, il pataugea dans le souvenir de ses vieux cloaques.","He interrupted his reading, ruminating far from prudish England, on the libertine peccadilloes, on the salacious preparations which the Church disapproves of; a concussion struck him; the anaphrodisia of his brain and his body, which he had believed definitive, dissipated; loneliness still acts on the derangement of his nerves; he was once again obsessed not by religion itself, but by the malice of the acts and sins it condemns; the habitual subject of his obsecrations and threats held him alone; the carnal side, insensitive for months, stirred at first by the nervousness of the pious readings, then awakened, put on its feet, in a crisis of neurosis, by the English cant; straightened up and the stimulation of his senses carrying him back, he waded in the memory of his old cesspools.","He put aside the book he was reading, put from him all thoughts of strait-laced Albion and let his mind dwell on the salacious seasoning, the prurient peccadilloes of which the Church disapproves. Suddenly he felt an emotional disturbance; his sexual insensibility of brain and body, which he had supposed to be complete and absolute, was shattered. Solitude was again affecting his tortured nerves, but this time it was not religion that obsessed him but the naughty sins religion condemns. The habitual subject of its threats and obsecrations was now the only thing that tempted him; the carnal side of his nature, which had lain dormant for months, had first been disturbed by his reading of pious works, then roused to wakefulness in an attack of nerves brought on by the English writer’s cant and was now all attention. With his stimulated senses carrying him back down the years, he had soon begun wallowing in the memory of his old dissipations.","His mind wandered off from his book to worlds far removed from the English prude: to wanton peccadilloes and salacious practices condemned by the Church. He grew excited. The impotence of his mind and body which he had supposed final, vanished. Solitude again acted on his disordered nerves; he was once more obsessed, not by religion itself, but by the acts and sins it forbids, by the subject of all its obsecrations and threats. The carnal side, atrophied for months, which had been stirred by the enervation of his pious readings, then brought to a crisis by the English cant, came to the surface. His stimulated senses carried him back to the past and he wallowed in memories of his old sin."
"Les excès de sa vie de garçon, les tensions exagérées de son cerveau, avaient singulièrement aggravé sa névrose originelle, amoindri le sang déjà usé de sa race; à Paris, il avait dû suivre des traitements d'hydrothérapie, pour des tremblements des doigts, pour des douleurs affreuses, des névralgies qui lui coupaient en deux la face, frappaient à coups continus la tempe, aiguillaient les paupières, provoquaient des nausées qu'il ne pouvait combattre qu'en s'étendant sur le dos, dans l'ombre.","The excesses of his life as a bachelor, the exaggerated tensions of his brain, had singularly aggravated his original neurosis, lessened the already worn blood of his race; in Paris, he had had to undergo hydrotherapy treatments, for trembling fingers, for terrible pains, neuralgia which cut his face in two, struck his temple with continuous blows, needled his eyelids, provoked nausea that he could only fight by lying on his back, in the shadows.","The excesses of his bachelor days and the abnormal strains put on his brain had aggravated his neurosis to an astonishing degree and still further diluted the impoverished blood of his race. In Paris he had been obliged to have hydropathic treatment6 for trembling of the hands and for atrocious neuralgic pains that seemed to cut his face in two, hammered away at his temples, stabbed at his eyelids and brought on fits of nausea he could only overcome by lying flat on his back in the dark.","The excesses of his youthful life, the exaggerated tension of his mind had strangely aggravated his earliest nervous disorder, and had thinned the already impoverished blood of his race. In Paris, he had been compelled to submit to hydrotherapic treatments for his trembling fingers, frightful pains, neuralgic strokes which cut his face in two, drummed maddeningly against his temples, pricked his eyelids agonizingly and induced a nausea which could be dispelled only by lying flat on his back in the dark."
"Ce spectacle ranima des Esseintes; l'intérêt qu'il prit à ce combat détournait ses pensées de son mal; devant l'acharnement de ces méchants mômes, il songea à la cruelle et abominable loi de la lutte pour l'existence, et bien que ces enfants fussent ignobles, il ne put s'empêcher de s'intéresser à leur sort et de croire que mieux eût valu pour eux que leur mère n'eût point mis bas.","This spectacle revived Des Esseintes; the interest he took in this combat diverted his thoughts from his illness; faced with the relentlessness of these wicked kids, he thought of the cruel and abominable law of the struggle for existence, and although these children were ignoble, he could not help being interested in their fate and believing that it would have been better for them if their mother had not given birth.","The sight put new life into Des Esseintes; the interest this fight aroused in him took his mind off his own sickly condition. Faced with the savage fury of these vicious brats, he reflected on the cruel and abominable law of the struggle for life, and contemptible though these children were, he could not help feeling sorry for them and thinking it would have been better for them if their mothers had never borne them.","At this sight, Des Esseintes recovered his animation. The interest he took in this fight distracted his thoughts from his illness. Contemplating the blind fury of these urchins, he thought of the cruel and abominable law of the struggle of existence; and, although these children were mean, he could not help being interested in their futures, yet could not but believe that it had been better for them had their mothers never given them birth."
"Et du hasard de cette rencontre, était née une défiante amitié qui se prolongea durant des mois; des Esseintes n'y pensait plus sans frémir; jamais il n'avait supporté un plus attirant et un plus impérieux fermage; jamais il n'avait connu des périls pareils, jamais aussi il ne s'était senti plus douloureusement satisfait.","And from the chance of this meeting, was born a defiant friendship which lasted for months; Des Esseintes no longer thought of it without shuddering; never had he endured a more attractive and more imperious tenant farming; never had he known such perils, never had he felt more painfully satisfied.","From this chance encounter there had sprung a mistrustful friendship that somehow lasted several months. Des Esseintes could not think of it now without a shudder; never had he submitted to more delightful or more stringent exploitation, never had he run such risks, yet never had he known such satisfaction mingled with distress.","He had regretted her defection, and now, recalling her, the other women seemed insipid, their childish graces and monotonous coquetry disgusting him."
"Les expressions, les procédés lui échappaient; il tâtonna; en somme, dans la fragrance de cette fleur, l'oranger domine: il tenta de plusieurs combinaisons et il finit par atteindre le ton juste, en joignant à l'oranger de la tubéreuse et de la rose qu'il lia par une goutte de vanille.","Expressions, methods escaped him; he groped; in short, in the fragrance of this flower, the orange tree dominates: he tried several combinations and he ended up reaching the right tone, joining the orange tree with tuberose and rose which he linked with a drop of vanilla.","The relevant formula and working method escaped his memory, so that he had to proceed by trial and error. He knew, of course, that in the fragrance of this particular flower, orange-blossom was the dominant element; and after trying various combinations he finally hit on the right tone by mixing the orange-blossom with tuberose and rose, binding the three together with a drop of vanilla.","He groped for a long time, unable to effect the proper combinations, for orange is dominant in the fragrance of this flower. He attempted several combinations and ended in achieving the exact blend by joining tuberose and rose to orange, the whole united by a drop of vanilla."
"Et, perdu dans sa contemplation, il scrutait les origines de ce grand artiste, de ce païen mystique, de cet illuminé qui pouvait s'abstraire assez du monde pour voir, en plein Paris, resplendir les cruelles visions, les féeriques apothéoses des autres âges.","And, lost in his contemplation, he scrutinized the origins of this great artist, this mystical pagan, this visionary who could abstract himself enough from the world to see, in the heart of Paris, the cruel visions, the magical apotheoses of other ages shine. .","Deep in contemplation, he would try to puzzle out the antecedents of this great artist, this mystical pagan, this illuminee who could shut out the modern world so completely as to behold, in the heart of present-day Paris, the awful visions and magical apotheoses of other ages.","Lost in contemplation, he sought to discover the origins of this great artist and mystic pagan, this visionary who succeeded in removing himself from the world sufficiently to behold, here in Paris, the splendor of these cruel visions and the enchanting sublimation of past ages."
"Son enfance avait été funèbre. Menacée de scrofules, accablée par d'opiniâtres fièvres, elle parvint cependant, à l'aide de grand air et de soins, à franchir les brisants de la nubilité, et alors les nerfs prirent le dessus, matèrent les langueurs et les abandons de la chlorose, menèrent jusqu'à leur entier développement les progressions de la croissance.","His childhood had been funereal.

"Quand il eut fermé son anthologie, des Esseintes se dit que sa bibliothèque arrêtée sur ce dernier livre, ne s'augmenterait probablement jamais plus.","When he had closed his anthology, Des Esseintes said to himself that his library, stopped on this last book, would probably never increase again.","When he had closed his anthology, the last book in his library, Des Esseintes told himself that in all probability he would never add another to his collection.","When he had closed his anthology, Des Esseintes told himself that his books which had ended on this last book, would probably never have anything added to it."
"Des Esseintes s'enferma dans sa chambre à coucher, se bouchant les oreilles aux coups de marteaux qui clouaient les caisses d'emballage apprêtées par les domestiques; chaque coup lui frappait le coeur, lui enfonçait une souffrance vive, en pleine chair. L'arrêt rendu par le médecin s'accomplissait; la crainte de subir, une fois de plus, les douleurs qu'il avait supportées, la peur d'une atroce agonie avaient agi plus puissamment sur des Esseintes que la haine de la détestable existence à laquelle la juridiction médicale le condamnait.","Des Esseintes shut himself up in his bedroom, plugging his ears to the blows of the hammers which nailed down the packing cases prepared by the servants; each blow struck his heart, drove a sharp pain into his flesh.

The sentence pronounced by the doctor was being executed; the dread of enduring all over again the sufferings he had recently undergone, together with the fear of an agonizing death, had had a more powerful effect on him than his hatred of the detestable existence to which medical jurisdiction condemned him.","Des Esseintes locked himself up in his bedroom, closing his ears to the sounds of hammers on packing cases. Each stroke rent his heart, drove a sorrow into his flesh. The physician's order was being fulfilled; the fear of once more submitting to the pains he had endured, the fear of a frightful agony had acted more powerfully on Des Esseintes than the hatred of the detestable existence to which the medical order condemned him."
"La plupart avaient des traits massifs, des voix enrouées, des gorges molles et des yeux peints, et toutes, pareilles à des automates remontés à la fois par la même clef, lançaient du même ton les mêmes invites, débitaient avec le même sourire les mêmes propos biscornus, les mêmes réflexions baroques.","Most of them had massive features, hoarse voices, soft throats and painted eyes, and all, like automatons wound at the same time by the same key, launched the same tone in the same tone, spouted the same smiles with the same smile. quirky words, the same baroque reflections.","Most of them had heavy features, hoarse voices, pendulous breasts, and painted eyes, and all of them, like automata wound up at the same time with the same key, threw out the same invitations in the same tone of voice, flashed the same smiles, made the same odd remarks, the same peculiar comments.","Most of them had heavy features, hoarse voices, flabby necks and painted eyes; and all of them, like automatons, moved simultaneously upon the same impulse, flung the same enticements with the same tone and uttered the identical queer words, the same odd inflections and the same smile."
"Ces idées, diamétralement opposées aux siennes, le faisaient sourire; puis le rôle joué par Tertullien, dans son évêché de Carthage, lui semblait suggestif en rêveries douces; plus que ses oeuvres, en réalité l'homme l'attirait.","These ideas, diametrically opposed to his own, made him smile; then the role played by Tertullian, in his bishopric of Carthage, seemed to him suggestive of sweet reveries; more than his works, in reality the man attracted him.","These ideas, diametrically opposed to his own, brought a smile to his lips, and he recalled the part played by Tertullian as Bishop of Carthage, a role which he considered pregnant with pleasant day-dreams. It was, in fact, the man more than his works that attracted him.","These ideas, diametrically opposed to his own, made him smile. Then the rôle played by Tertullian, in his Carthage bishopric, seemed to him suggestive in pleasant reveries. More even than his works did the man attract him."
"Des Esseintes étudiait, analysait l'âme de ces fluides, faisait l'exégèse de ces textes; il se complaisait à jouer pour sa satisfaction personnelle, le rôle d'un psychologue, à démonter et à remonter les rouages d'une oeuvre, à dévisser les pièces formant la structure d'une exhalaison composée, et, dans cet exercice, son odorat était parvenu à la sûreté d'une touche presque impeccable.","Des Esseintes studied, analyzed the soul of these fluids, made the exegesis of these texts; he took pleasure in playing for his personal satisfaction, the role of a psychologist, in dismantling and reassembling the cogs of a work, in unscrewing the parts forming the structure of a compound exhalation, and, in this exercise, his sense of smell had achieved the safety of an almost flawless touch.","Des Esseintes studied and analysed the spirit of these compounds and worked on an interpretation of these texts; for his own personal pleasure and satisfaction he took to playing the psychologist, to dismantling the mechanism of a work and reassembling it, to unscrewing the separate pieces forming the structure of a composite odour, and as a result of these operations his sense of smell had acquired an almost infallible flair.","Des Esseintes studied and analyzed the essences of these fluids, experimenting to corroborate their texts.

"Allumé comme un feu de paille, son enthousiasme pour le sustenteur tomba de même. D'abord engourdie, la dyspepsie nerveuse se réveilla; puis, cette échauffante essence de nourriture détermina une telle irritation dans ses entrailles que des Esseintes dut, au plus tôt, en cesser l'usage.","Lit like a flash in the pan, his enthusiasm for the sustentator likewise died down. At first numb, the nervous dyspepsia awoke; then, this warming essence of nourishment produced such an irritation in his entrails that Des Esseintes had to stop using it as soon as possible.","After blazing up like a flash in the pan, Des Esseintes’s enthusiasm for his digester died down just as suddenly. His dyspepsia, banished for a little while, began plaguing him again, while all this concentrated food was so binding and brought on such an irritation of the bowels that he had to stop using the apparatus straight away.","Burning at first like a rick on fire, his enthusiasm for the digester as quickly died out.

"Les croisées dont les vitres, craquelées, bleuâtres, parsemées de culs de bouteille aux bosses piquetées d'or, interceptaient la vue de la campagne et ne laissaient pénétrer qu'une lumière feinte, se vêtirent, à leur tour, de rideaux taillés dans de vieilles étoles, dont l'or assombri et quasi sauré, s'éteignait dans la trame d'un roux presque mort.","The windows, whose cracked, bluish panes, strewn with bottoms of bottles with bumps dotted with gold, intercepted the view of the countryside and let in only a feigned light, were dressed, in their turn, in curtains cut in old stoles, whose gold darkened and almost stained, faded in the weft of an almost dead russet.","The windows, with panes of bluish crackle-glass or gilded bottle-punts which shut out the view and admitted only a very dim light, were dressed with curtains cut out of old ecclesiastical stoles, whose faded gold threads were almost invisible against the dull red material.","The windows whose blue fissured panes, stippled with fragments of gold-edged bottles, intercepted the view of the country and only permitted a faint light to enter, were draped with curtains cut from old stoles of dark and reddish gold neutralized by an almost dead russet woven in the pattern."
"Aujourd'hui, quand le sang la travaillait, elle ne pouvait se résoudre à entrer, à consommer, à payer et à sortir; c'était, à ses yeux, de la bestialité, du rut de chien couvrant sans préambules une chienne; puis la vanité fuyait, inassouvie, de ces maisons tolérées où il n'y avait eu, ni simulacre de résistance, ni semblant de victoire, ni préférence espérée, ni même de largesse obtenue de la part de la marchande qui aurait ses tendresses, suivant les prix. Au contraire, la cour faite à une fille de brasserie, ménageait toutes les susceptibilités de l'amour, toutes les délicatesses du sentiment. Celle-là, on se la disputait, et ceux auxquels elle consentait à octroyer, moyennant de copieux salaires, un rendez-vous, s'imaginaient, de bonne foi, l'avoir emporté sur un rival, être l'objet d'une distinction honorifique, d'une faveur rare.","Today, when the blood tormented her, she could not bring herself to enter, consume, pay and leave; it was, in his eyes, bestiality, a dog's rut covering a female dog without preamble; then vanity fled, unsatisfied, from these tolerated houses where there had been neither sham resistance, nor semblance of victory, nor hoped-for preference, nor even largesse obtained from the merchant who would have her affections, according to the prices. On the contrary, courting a girl in a brasserie spared all the susceptibilities of love, all the delicacies of feeling. That one was disputed, and those to whom she consented to grant, in return for copious salaries, an appointment, imagined, in good faith, that they had prevailed over a rival, that they were the object of a honorary distinction, of rare favour.","The result was that nowadays, when its blood caught fire, it could not stomach just walking in, taking its pleasure, paying the bill and walking out again. This, in its eyes, was sheer bestiality, like a dog covering a bitch without any preamble; besides, a man’s vanity obtained no sort of satisfaction in these houses of ill fame where there was no show of resistance, no semblance of victory, no hope of preferential treatment, no possibility even of obtaining liberal favours from a tradeswoman who measured out her caresses in proportion to the price paid. On the other hand, to court a girl in a tavern was to avoid wounding all these amorous susceptibilities, all these sentimental feelings. There were always several men after a girl like that, and those to whom she agreed, at a price, to grant a rendezvous, honestly imagined that they were the object of an honorary distinction, a rare favour.","Today, when the blood clamored, youths could not bring themselves to go through the formality of entering, ending, paying and leaving; in their eyes, this was bestiality, the action of a dog attacking a bitch without much ado. Then, too, vanity fled unsatisfied from these houses where there was no semblance of resistance; there was no victory, no hoped for preference, nor even largess obtained from the tradeswoman who measured her caresses according to the price. On the contrary, the courting of a girl of the cafés stimulated all the susceptibilities of love, all the refinements of sentiment. One disputed with the others for such a girl, and those to whom she granted a rendezvous, in consideration of much money, were sincere in imagining that they had won her from a rival, and in so thinking they were the objects of honorary distinction and favor."
"Baudelaire et Poe, ces deux esprits qu'on avait souvent appariés, à cause de leur commune poétique, de leur inclination partagée pour l'examen des maladies mentales, différaient radicalement par les conceptions affectives qui tenaient une si large place dans leurs oeuvres; Baudelaire avec son amour, altéré et inique, dont le cruel dégoût faisait songer aux représailles d'une inquisition; Poe, avec ses amours chastes, aériennes, où les sens n'existaient pas, où la cervelle solitaire s'érigeait, sans correspondre à des organes qui, s'ils existaient, demeuraient à jamais glacés et vierges.","Baudelaire and Poe, these two minds who had often been paired, because of their common poetics, their shared inclination for the examination of mental illnesses, differed radically in the affective conceptions which occupied such a large place in their works; Baudelaire with his love, altered and iniquitous, whose cruel disgust made one think of the reprisals of an inquisition; Poe, with his chaste, airy loves, where the senses did not exist, where the solitary brain rose up, without corresponding to organs which, if they existed, remained forever frozen and virgin.","Baudelaire and Poe, whose two minds had often been compared on account of their common poetic inspiration and the penchant they shared for the examination of mental diseases, differed radically in the emotional concepts which played a large part in their works – Baudelaire with his thirsty, ruthless passion, whose disgusted cruelty recalled the tortures of the Inquisition, and Poe with his chaste, ethereal amours, in which the senses had no share and only the brain was roused, followed by none of the lower organs, which, if they existed at all, remained for ever frozen and virgin.","Baudelaire and Poe, these two men who had often been compared because of their common poetic strain and predilection for the examination of mental maladies, differed radically in the affective conceptions which held such a large place in their works; Baudelaire with his iniquitous and debased loves—cruel loves which made one think of the reprisals of an inquisition; Poe with his chaste, ærial loves, in which the senses played no part, where only the mind functioned without corresponding to organs which, if they existed, remained forever frozen and virgin."
"Là, il n'avait plus de raisonnement à se faire, plus de débats à supporter; c'était une indéfinissable impression de respect et de crainte; le sens artiste était subjugué par les scènes si bien calculées des catholiques; à ces souvenirs, ses nerfs tressaillaient, puis en une subite rébellion, en une rapide volte, des idées monstrueuses naissaient en lui, des idées de ces sacrilèges prévus par le manuel des confesseurs, des ignominieux et impurs abus de l'eau bénite et de l'huile sainte. En face d'un Dieu omnipotent, se dressait maintenant un rival plein de force, le Démon, et une affreuse grandeur lui semblait devoir résulter d'un crime pratiqué, en pleine église par un croyant s'acharnant, dans une horrible allégresse, dans une joie toute sadique, à blasphémer, à couvrir d'outrages, à abreuver d'opprobres, les choses révérées; des folies de magie, de messe noire, de sabbat, des épouvantes de possessions et d'exorcismes se levaient; il en venait à se demander s'il ne commettait pas un sacrilège, en possédant des objets autrefois consacrés, des canons d'église, des chasubles et des custodes; et, cette pensée d'un état peccamineux lui apportait une sorte d'orgueil et d'allègement; il y démêlait des plaisirs de sacrilèges, mais de sacrilèges contestables, en tout cas, peu graves, puisqu'en somme il aimait ces objets et n'en dépravait pas l'usage; il se berçait ainsi de pensées prudentes et lâches, la suspicion de son âme lui interdisant des crimes manifestes, lui enlevant la bravoure nécessaire pour accomplir des péchés épouvantables, voulus, réels.","There, he had no more reasoning to do, no more arguments to endure; it was an indefinable impression of respect and fear; the artistic sense was subjugated by the scenes so well calculated by the Catholics; his nerves quivered at these memories, then in a sudden rebellion, in a rapid volte, monstrous ideas were born in him, ideas of those sacrileges foreseen by the manual of confessors, of the ignominious and impure abuses of holy water and holy oil. Opposite an omnipotent God now stood a rival full of strength, the Demon, and a frightful greatness seemed to him to result from a crime committed, in the middle of the church by a believer relentlessly, in horrible joy, in a wholly sadistic joy in blaspheming, in insulting, in heaping opprobrium on revered things; madnesses of magic, black mass, sabbath, terrors of possessions and exorcisms arose; he came to wonder whether he was not committing a sacrilege by possessing formerly consecrated objects, church canons, chasubles and pyxes; and, this thought of a sinful state brought him a kind of pride and relief; he disentangled in them sacrilegious pleasures, but debatable sacrileges, in any case, not very serious, since in short he loved these objects and did not deprecate their use; he thus cradled himself in prudent and cowardly thoughts, the suspicion of his soul forbidding him from manifest crimes, depriving him of the bravery necessary to commit terrible, willed, real sins.","Here there was no longer any room for argument or discussion; there was no denying that he had an indefinable feeling of veneration and fear, that his artistic sense was subjugated by the nicely calculated scenes of Catholic ceremonial. His nerves shuddered at these memories, and then, in a sudden mood of revolt, a swift volte-face, ideas of monstrous depravity came to him – thoughts of the profanities foreseen in the Confessors’ Manual, of the impure and ignominious ways in which holy water and consecrated oil could be abused.3 An omnipotent God was now confronted by the upright figure of a powerful adversary, the Devil; and it seemed to Des Esseintes that a frightful glory must result from any crime committed in open church by a believer filled with dreadful merriment and sadistic joy, bent on blasphemy, resolved to desecrate and befoul the objects of veneration. The mad rites of magical ceremonies, black masses and witches’ sabbaths, together with the horrors of demonic possession and exorcism, were enacted before his mind’s eye; and he began to wonder if he were not guilty of sacrilege in possessing articles which had once been solemnly consecrated, such as altar cards, chasubles and custodials. This idea, that he was possibly living in a state of sin, filled him with a certain pride and satisfaction, not unmixed with delight in these sacrilegious acts – which might not be sacrilegious at all, and in any case were not very serious offences, seeing that he really loved these articles and did not put them to any depraved uses. He beguiled himself in this way with prudent, cowardly thoughts, the uncertainty of his soul preventing him from perpetrating overt crimes, robbing him of the necessary courage to commit real sins of real iniquity with real intent.","On this plane, no reasonings were necessary; there were no further contests to be endured. He had an indescribable impression of respect and fear. His artistic sense was conquered by the skillfully calculated Catholic rituals. His nerves quivered at these memories. Then, in sudden rebellion, in a sudden reversion, monstrous ideas were born in him, fancies concerning those sacrileges warned against by the manual of the Father confessors, of the scandalous, impure desecration of holy water and sacred oil. The Demon, a powerful rival, now stood against an omnipotent God. A frightful grandeur seemed to Des Esseintes to emanate from a crime committed in church by a believer bent, with blasphemously horrible glee and sadistic joy, over such revered objects, covering them with outrages and saturating them in opprobrium. Before him were conjured up the madnesses of magic, of the black mass, of the witches' revels, of terrors of possessions and of exorcisms. He reached the point where he wondered if he were not committing a sacrilege in possessing objects which had once been consecrated: the Church canons, chasubles and pyx covers. And this idea of a state of sin imparted to him a mixed sensation of pride and relief. The pleasures of sacrilege were unravelled from the skein of this idea, but these were debatable sacrileges, in any case, and hardly serious, since he really loved these objects and did not pollute them by misuse. In this wise he lulled himself with prudent and cowardly thoughts, the caution of his soul forbidding obvious crimes and depriving him of the courage necessary to the consummation of frightful and deliberate sins."
- Alors c'est la mort ou l'envoi au bagne! s'exclama des Esseintes exaspéré.,- So it's death or sent to prison! exclaimed Des Esseintes in exasperation.,‘So I have to choose between death and deportation!’ cried Des Esseintes in exasperation.,“So it is a choice between death and the hulks!” Des Esseintes exasperatedly exclaimed.
"En dépit de sa forme magnifique, en dépit de l'imposante allure de ses vers qui se dressaient avec un tel éclat que les hexamètres d'Hugo même semblaient, en comparaison, mornes et sourds, Leconte de Lisle ne pouvait plus maintenant le satisfaire. L'antiquité si merveilleusement ressuscitée par Flaubert, restait entre ses mains immobile et froide. Rien ne palpitait dans ses vers tout en façade que n'étayait, la plupart du temps, aucune idée; rien ne vivait dans ces poèmes déserts dont les impassibles mythologies finissaient par le glacer. D'autre part, après l'avoir longtemps choyée, des Esseintes arrivait aussi à se désintéresser de l'oeuvre de Gautier; son admiration pour l'incomparable peintre qu'était cet homme, était allée en se dissolvant de jours en jours, et maintenant il demeurait plus étonné que ravi, par ses descriptions en quelque sorte indifférentes. L'impression des objets s'était fixée sur son oeil si perceptif, mais elle s'y était localisée, n'avait pas pénétré plus avant dans sa cervelle et dans sa chair; de même qu'un prodigieux réflecteur, il s'était constamment borné à réverbérer, avec une impersonnelle netteté, des alentours.","Despite his magnificent form, despite the imposing bearing of his verses which rose with such brilliance that even Hugo's hexameters seemed, in comparison, dull and dull, Leconte de Lisle could no longer satisfy him. Antiquity, so marvelously revived by Flaubert, remained in his motionless and cold hands. Nothing throbbed in his verses, all on the face of it, unsupported, most of the time, by an idea; nothing lived in these empty poems whose impassive mythologies ended up freezing him. On the other hand, after having pampered her for a long time, des Esseintes also managed to lose interest in Gautier's work; his admiration for the incomparable painter that this man was, had been dissolving day by day, and now he remained more astonished than delighted, by his somewhat indifferent descriptions. The impression of objects was fixed on his perceptual eye, but it was localized there, had not penetrated further into his brain and into his flesh; like a prodigious reflector, it had constantly confined itself to reverberating, with an impersonal clearness, from the surroundings.","In spite of his magnificent formal qualities, in spite of the imposing majesty of his verse, which had such a splendid air that even Hugo’s hexameters seemed dull and drab in comparison, Leconte de Lisle13 could now no longer satisfy him. The ancient world which Flaubert had resuscitated with such marvellous success remained cold and lifeless in his hands. Nothing stirred in his poetry; it was all a façade with, most of the time, not a single idea to prop it up. There was no life in these empty poems, and their frigid mythologies ended up by repelling him. Similarly, after cherishing him for many years, Des Esseintes was beginning to lose interest in Gautier’s work; his admiration for the incomparable painter of word-pictures that Gautier was had recently been diminishing day by day, so that now he was more astonished than delighted by his almost apathetic descriptions. Outside objects had made a lasting impression on his remarkably perceptive eye, but that impression had become localized, had failed to penetrate any further into brain or body; like a marvellous reflector, he had always confined himself to sending back the image of his surroundings with impersonal precision.","Notwithstanding the majestic form and the imposing quality of his verse which struck such a brilliant note that even the hexameters of Hugo seemed pale in comparison, Leconte de Lisle could no longer satisfy him. The antiquity so marvelously restored by Flaubert remained cold and immobile in his hands. Nothing palpitated in his verses, which lacked depth and which, most often, contained no idea. Nothing moved in those gloomy, waste poems whose impassive mythologies ended by finally leaving him cold. Too, after having long delighted in Gautier, Des Esseintes reached the point where he no longer cared for him. The admiration he felt for this man's incomparable painting had gradually dissolved; now he was more astonished than ravished by his descriptions. Objects impressed themselves upon Gautier's perceptive eyes but they went no further, they never penetrated deeper into his brain and flesh. Like a giant mirror, this writer constantly limited himself to reflecting surrounding objects with impersonal clearness."
"C'étaient, poussées jusqu'à leur dernière expression, les quintessences de Baudelaire et de Poe; c'étaient leurs fines et puissantes substances encore distillées et dégageant de nouveaux fumets, de nouvelles ivresses.","They were, pushed to their last expression, the quintessences of Baudelaire and Poe; it was their fine and powerful substances still distilled and giving off new aromas, new intoxications.","Here, carried to the further limits of expression, was the quintessence of Baudelaire and Poe; here their refined and potent substances had been distilled yet again to give off new savours, new intoxications.",Here were the quintessences of Baudelaire and of Poe; here were their fine and powerful substances distilled and disengaging new flavors and intoxications.
"Un sourire lui plissa les lèvres, car subitement il se rappelait l'étrange comparaison du vieux Nicandre qui assimilait, au point de vue de la forme, le pistil des lys aux génitoires d'un âne, et un passage d'Albert le Grand lui revenait également, celui où ce thaumaturge enseigne un bien singulier moyen de connaître, en se servant d'une laitue, si une fille est encore vierge.","A smile creased his lips, for suddenly he remembered the strange comparison of old Nicander who likened, from the point of view of form, the pistil of lilies to the genitals of an ass, and a passage from Albert the Great there was also the one where this thaumaturge teaches a very singular way of knowing, by using a lettuce, if a girl is still a virgin.","A smile puckered his lips, for he suddenly remembered the quaint comparison old Nicander once made, from the point of view of shape, between the pistil of a lily and the genitals of an ass, and also the passage in Albertus Magnus where that miracle-worker expounds a most peculiar method of discovering, with the aid of a lettuce, whether a girl is still a virgin.","A smile played on his lips, for he suddenly recalled the strange comparison of old Nicandre, who likened, in the point of form, the pistils of lillies to the genital organs of a donkey; and he recalled also a passage from Albert le Grand, in which that thaumaturgist describes a strange way of discovering whether a girl is still a virgin, by means of a lettuce. These remembrances distracted him somewhat."
"À ce moment, le galop d'un cheval s'approcha. Une effroyable terreur poigna des Esseintes; ses jambes se dérobèrent; le galop se précipitait; le désespoir le releva comme d'un coup de fouet; il se jeta sur la femme qui piétinait maintenant les fourneaux des pipes, la supplia de se taire, de ne pas les dénoncer par le bruit de ses bottes. Elle se débattait, il l'entraîna au fond du corridor, l'étranglant pour l'empêcher de crier, il aperçut, tout à coup, une porte d'estaminet, à persiennes peintes en vert, sans loquet, la poussa, prit son élan et s'arrêta.","At this moment, a galloping horse approached. A frightful terror gripped Des Esseintes; his legs gave way; the gallop hurried on; despair lifted him up like a whiplash; he threw himself on the woman who was now trampling the bowls of the pipes, begged her to be quiet, not to denounce them with the sound of her boots. She was struggling, he dragged her to the end of the corridor, strangling her to prevent her from screaming, he suddenly saw a tavern door, with shutters painted green, without a latch, pushed it open, took his momentum and stopped.","At that moment a galloping horse was heard approaching. Terror seized Des Esseintes and his legs went limp under him. But as the sound of hoofs came nearer, despair stung him to action like the crack of a whip; he flung himself upon the woman, who was now stamping on the pipe bowls, begging her to be quiet and not to betray them both by the noise of her boots. She struggled furiously, and he had to drag her to the end of the passage, throttling her to stop her crying out. Then, all of a sudden, he noticed a tap-room door with green-painted shutters and saw that it was unlatched; he pushed it open, dashed through – and stopped dead.","At this moment were heard the galloping sounds of an approaching horse. A fearful terror pierced Des Esseintes. His limbs gave way. The galloping grew louder. Despair brought him sharply to his senses. He threw himself upon the woman who was stamping on the pipe bowls, entreating her to be silent, not to give notice of their presence by the sound of her shoes. She writhed and struggled in his grip; he led her to the end of the corridor, strangling her to prevent her from crying out. Suddenly he noticed the door of a coffee house, with green Venetian shutters. It was unlocked; he pushed it, rushed in headlong and then paused."
"Et, en effet, tels de ces visages, mangés par des yeux immenses, par des yeux fous; tels de ces corps grandis outre mesure ou déformés comme au travers d'une carafe, évoquaient dans la mémoire de des Esseintes des souvenirs de fièvre typhoïde, des souvenirs restés quand même des nuits brûlantes, des affreuses visions de son enfance.","And, indeed, such of these faces, devoured by immense eyes, by mad eyes; Some of these bodies, grown beyond measure or deformed as though through a carafe, evoked in Des Esseintes' memory memories of typhoid fever, memories that had remained all the same of scorching nights, frightful visions of his childhood.","In fact, there were some of these faces, dominated by great wild eyes, and some of these bodies, magnified beyond measure or distorted as if seen through a carafe of water, that evoked in Des Esseintes’s mind recollections of typhoid fever, memories which had somehow stayed with him of the feverish nights and frightful nightmares of his childhood.","And, indeed, certain of these faces, with their monstrous, insane eyes, certain of these swollen, deformed bodies resembling carafes, induced in Des Esseintes recollections of typhoid, memories of feverish nights and of the shocking visions of his infancy which persisted and would not be suppressed."
"Elle se divisait en deux groupes: l'un comprenait la littérature ordinaire, profane; l'autre la littérature catholique, une littérature spéciale, à peu près inconnue, divulguée pourtant par de séculaires et d'immenses maisons de librairie, aux quatre coins du monde.","It fell into two groups: one comprised ordinary, secular literature; the other Catholic literature, a special literature, almost unknown, nevertheless divulged by centuries-old and immense bookshops, in the four corners of the world.","It fell into two distinct categories, one comprising ordinary profane literature, the other the works of Catholic writers – a very special literature, almost unknown to the general reader, and yet disseminated by enormous, long-established firms to the far corners of the earth.","This section was divided into two groups, one of which included the ordinary, secular literature, and the other the Catholic literature, a special but little known literature published by large publishing houses and circulated to the four corners of the earth."
"Pour cela, il lui avait d'abord fallu travailler la grammaire, comprendre la syntaxe des odeurs, se bien pénétrer des règles qui les régissent, et, une fois familiarisé avec ce dialecte, comparer les oeuvres des maîtres, des Atkinson et des Lubin, des Chardin et des Violet, des Legrand et des Piesse, désassembler la construction de leurs phrases, peser la proportion de leurs mots et l'arrangement de leurs périodes.","To do this, he had first had to work on grammar, understand the syntax of odors, fully understand the rules that govern them, and, once familiar with this dialect, compare the works of the masters, the Atkinsons and the Lubins, of the Chardins and the Violets, of the Legrands and the Piesses, to disassemble the construction of their sentences, to weigh the proportion of their words and the arrangement of their periods.","To do this he had first had to master the grammar, to understand the syntax of smells, to get a firm grasp on the rules that govern them, and, once he was familiar with this dialect, to compare the works of the great masters, the Atkinsons and Lubins, the Chardins and Violets, the Legrands and Piesses, to analyse the construction of their sentences, to weigh the proportion of their words, to measure the arrangement of their periods.","To achieve this end he had first been compelled to master the grammar and understand the syntax of odors, learning the secret of the rules that regulate them, and, once familiarized with the dialect, he compared the works of the masters, of the Atkinsons and Lubins, the Chardins and Violets, the Legrands and Piesses; then he separated the construction of their phrases, weighed the value of their words and the arrangement of their periods."
"Mais, il fallait arriver aux écrivains qui n'avaient point subi l'ordination, aux écrivains séculiers, attachés aux intérêts du catholicisme et dévoués à sa cause, pour retrouver des prosateurs qui valussent qu'on s'arrêtât.","But, it was necessary to reach the writers who had not undergone ordination, the secular writers, attached to the interests of Catholicism and devoted to its cause, to find prose writers who were worth stopping for.","But it was only among writers who had not been ordained, among secular authors who were devoted to the Catholic cause and had its interests at heart, that prosaists worthy of attention were to be found.","But to find writers of prose whose works justify close study, one was obliged to seek those who had not submitted to Ordination; to the secular writers whom the interests of Catholicism engaged and devoted to its cause."
"À ce moment, la lierre de la taverne s'ouvrit; des gens entrèrent apportant avec eux une odeur de chien mouillé à laquelle se mêla une fumée de houille, rabattue par le vent dans la cuisine dont la porte sans loquet claqua; des Esseintes était incapable de remuer les jambes; un doux et tiède anéantissement se glissait par tous ses membres, l'empêchait même d'étendre la main pour allumer un cigare. Il se disait: Allons, voyons, debout, il faut filer; et d'immédiates objections contrariaient ses ordres. à quoi bon bouger, quand on peut voyager si magnifiquement sur une chaise? N'était-il pas à Londres dont les senteurs, dont l'atmosphère, dont les habitants, dont les pâtures, dont les ustensiles, l'environnaient? Que pouvait-il donc espérer, sinon de nouvelles désillusions, comme en Hollande?","At this moment, the ivy of the tavern opened; people came in bringing with them the smell of wet dogs mingled with the smoke of coal, blown by the wind into the kitchen, the latchless door of which slammed shut; des Esseintes was unable to move his legs; a soft, warm annihilation crept through all his limbs, even preventing him from stretching out his hand to light a cigar. He said to himself: Come on, let's see, get up, we have to spin; and immediate objections thwarted his orders. what's the use of moving, when you can travel so magnificently on a chair? Was he not in London whose scents, whose atmosphere, whose inhabitants, whose pastures, whose utensils, surrounded him? What could he hope for, if not new disappointments, as in Holland?","At that moment the street door opened and some people came in, bringing with them a wet doggy smell. The wind blew clouds of steam back into the kitchen and rattled the unlatched door. Des Esseintes felt incapable of stirring a finger; a soothing feeling of warmth and lassitude was seeping into every limb, so that he could not even lift his hand to light a cigar. ‘Get up, man, and go,’ he kept telling himself, but these orders were no sooner given than countermanded. After all, what was the good of moving, when a fellow could travel so magnificently sitting in a chair? Wasn’t he already in London, whose smells, weather, citizens, food and even cutlery, were all about him? What could he expect to find over there, save fresh disappointments such as he had suffered in Holland?","At this moment, the tavern door opened. Several persons entered bringing with them an odor of wet dog to which was blent the smell of coal wafted by the wind through the opened door. Des Esseintes was incapable of moving a limb. A soft warm languor prevented him from even stretching out his hand to light a cigar. He told himself: “Come now, let us get up, we must take ourselves off.” Immediate objections thwarted his orders. What is the use of moving, when one can travel on a chair so magnificently? Was he not even now in London, whose aromas and atmosphere and inhabitants, whose food and utensils surrounded him? For what could he hope, if not new disillusionments, as had happened to him in Holland?"
"Un beau soir, il se résolut à dépêcher les ouvreuses. Miss Urania crut nécessaire de ne point céder, sans une préalable cour; néanmoins elle se montra peu farouche, sachant par les ouï-dire, que des Esseintes était riche et que son nom aidait à lancer les femmes.","One fine evening, he resolved to dispatch the usherettes. Miss Urania thought it necessary not to yield, without prior courtship; nevertheless she showed herself not shy, knowing from hearsay that Des Esseintes was rich and that his name helped to launch women.","At last, one fine evening, he sent her a message by one of the circus attendants. Miss Urania deemed it necessary not to surrender without a little preliminary courting; however, she was careful not to appear over-shy, having heard that Des Esseintes was rich and that his name could help a woman in her career.","One evening he finally decided to communicate with her and dispatched one of the attendants on this errand. Miss Urania deemed it necessary not to yield before a preliminary courtship; but she showed herself amenable, as it was common gossip that Des Esseintes was rich and that his name was instrumental in establishing women."
"Il en était de même de l'""Intersigne"" qui avait été plus tard réuni aux Contes cruels, un recueil d'un indiscutable talent, dans lequel se trouvait ""Véra"", une nouvelle, que des Esseintes considérait ainsi qu'un petit chef-d'oeuvre.","The same was true of the ""Intersigne"" which had later been combined with the Contes cruels, a collection of indisputable talent, in which was found ""Véra"", a short story, which Des Esseintes considered as a little chef - of work.","The same was true of L’Intersigne, which had later been incorporated in the Contes cruels, a collection of stories of indisputable talent which also included Véra, a tale Des Esseintes regarded as a little masterpiece.","This also applied to the Intersigne, which had later been joined to the Contes cruels, a collection of indisputable talent in which was found Véra, which Des Esseintes considered a little masterpiece."
"Il avait acquis ses deux chefs-d'oeuvre et, pendant des nuits, il rêvait devant l'un deux, le tableau de la Salomé ainsi conçu:","He had acquired his two masterpieces and, for nights, he dreamed in front of one of them, the picture of Salome thus conceived:","He had bought Moreau’s two masterpieces, and night after night he would stand dreaming in front of one of them, the picture of Salome.1","Des Esseintes had acquired his two masterpieces and, at night, used to sink into revery before one of them—a representation of Salomé, conceived in this fashion:"
"Et le fait est, continua des Esseintes, poursuivant son raisonnement, le fait est que, comme la douleur est un effet de l'éducation, comme elle s'élargit et s'acière à mesure que les idées naissent: plus on s'efforcera d'équarrir l'intelligence et d'affiner le système nerveux des pauvres diables, et plus on développera en eux les germes si furieusement vivaces de la souffrance morale et de la haine.","And the fact is, continued des Esseintes, pursuing his reasoning, the fact is that, as pain is an effect of education, as it widens and sharpens as ideas are born: the more one will strive to square up the intelligence and to refine the nervous system of the poor devils, the more one will develop in them the seeds so furiously alive of moral suffering and hatred.","‘And the fact is,’ he added, following this line of thought still further, ‘the fact is that, pain being one of the consequences of education, in that it grows greater and sharper with the growth of ideas, it follows that the more we try to polish the minds and refine the nervous systems of the under-privileged, the more we shall be developing in their hearts the atrociously active germs of hatred and moral suffering.’","Although he experienced no inclination for the state of grace, he felt a genuine sympathy for those souls immured in monasteries, persecuted by a vengeful society which can forgive neither the merited scorn with which it inspires them, nor the desire to expiate, to atone by long silences, for the ever growing shamelessness of its ridiculous or trifling gossipings."
"Maniant mieux que pas un la métrique, il avait tenté de rajeunir les poèmes à forme fixe: le sonnet qu'il retournait, la queue en l'air, de même que certains poissons japonais en terre polychrome qui posent sur leur socle, les ouïes en bas; ou bien il le dépravait, en n'accouplant que des rimes masculines pour lesquelles il semblait éprouver une affection; il avait également et souvent usé d'une forme bizarre, d'une strophe de trois vers dont le médian restait privé de rime, et d'un tercet, monorime, suivi d'un unique vers, jeté en guise de refrain et se faisant écho avec lui-même tels que les streets: ""Dansons la Gigue""; il avait employé d'autres rythmes encore où le timbre presque effacé ne s'entendait plus que dans des strophes lointaines, comme un son éteint de cloche.","Wielding meter better than anyone, he had tried to rejuvenate fixed-form poems: the sonnet that he turned over, its tail in the air, as well as certain Japanese polychrome earthenware fish that pose on their plinth, the gills downstairs; or else he depraved him, by coupling only masculine rhymes for which he seemed to feel an affection; he had also and often used a bizarre form, a stanza of three lines whose middle remained deprived of rhyme, and a tercet, monorime, followed by a single line, thrown in as a refrain and becoming echo with itself such as the streets: ""Dansons la Gigue""; he had used still other rhythms in which the almost obliterated tone could only be heard in distant stanzas, like the faint sound of a bell.","Handling metre better than anyone, he had tried to rejuvenate the stereotyped forms of poetry, the sonnet for example, which he turned upside down, like those Japanese fish in coloured earthenware that are stood gills down on their pedestals, or which he perverted by coupling only masculine rhymes, for which he seemed to have a special affection. Similarly and not infrequently he had adopted a weird form such as a stanza of three lines with the middle one left unrhymed, or a mono-rhyme tercet followed by a single line serving as a refrain and echoing itself, like the line ‘Dansons la gigue’ in the poem Streets. He had used other rhythms too whose faint beat could be only half-heard behind the stanzas, like the muffled sound of a bell.","With his unrivalled ability to handle metre, he had sought to rejuvenate the fixed poetic forms. He turned the tail of the sonnet into the air, like those Japanese fish of polychrome clay which rest on stands, their heads straight down, their tails on top. Sometimes he corrupted it by using only masculine rhymes to which he seemed partial. He had often employed a bizarre form—a stanza of three lines whose middle verse was unrhymed, and a tiercet with but one rhyme, followed by a single line, an echoing refrain like “Dansons la Gigue” in Streets. He had employed other rhymes whose dim echoes are repeated in remote stanzas, like faint reverberations of a bell."
"Confinés au contraire sur leur territoire, écroués dans d'identiques et d'anciennes lectures, ignorant le mouvement littéraire des siècles et bien décidés, au besoin, à se crever les yeux pour ne pas le voir, les ecclésiastiques employaient nécessairement une langue immuable, comme cette langue du XVIIIe, siècle que les descendants des Français établis au Canada parlent et écrivent couramment encore, sans qu'aucune sélection de tournures ou de mots ait pu se produire dans leur idiome isolé de l'ancienne métropole et enveloppé, de tous les côtés, par la langue anglaise.","Confined on the contrary to their territory, imprisoned in identical and ancient readings, ignoring the literary movement of the centuries and well decided, if necessary, to put out their eyes not to see it, the ecclesiastics necessarily used an immutable language, like this 18th century language that the descendants of the French established in Canada still speak and write fluently, without any selection of turns or words having been able to occur in their idiom isolated from the old metropolis and enveloped, from all the sides, by the English language.","The very opposite had been the case with the ecclesiastical writers; confined to their own territory, imprisoned within an identical, traditional range of reading, knowing nothing of the literary evolution of more recent times and absolutely determined, if need be, to pluck their eyes out rather than recognize it, they necessarily employed an unaltered and unalterable language, like that eighteenth-century language which the descendants of the French settlers in Canada normally speak and write to this day, no variation in vocabulary or phraseology having ever been possible in their idiom, cut off as it is from the old country and surrounded on all sides by the English tongue.","The ecclesiastical writers, on the contrary, confined within specific limitations, restricted to ancient Church literature, knowing nothing of the literary progress of the centuries and determined if need be to blind their eyes the more surely not to see, necessarily were constrained to the use of an inflexible language, like that of the eighteenth century which descendants of the French who settled in Canada still speak and write today, without change of phrasing or words, having succeeded in preserving their original idiom by isolation in certain metropolitan centres, despite the fact that they are enveloped upon every side by English-speaking peoples."
"Sous les traits ardents échappés de la tête du Précurseur, toutes les facettes des joailleries s'embrasent; les pierres s'animent, dessinent le corps de la femme en traits incandescents; la piquent au cou, aux jambes, aux bras, de points de feu, vermeils comme des charbons, violets comme des jets de gaz, bleus comme des flammes d'alcool, blancs comme des rayons d'astre.","Under the fiery features emanating from the Precursor's head, all the facets of the jewels are set ablaze; the stones come to life, outline the woman's body in incandescent lines; prick her neck, legs, arms, with points of fire, vermilion like coals, violet like jets of gas, blue like flames of alcohol, white like star rays.","Under the brilliant rays emanating from the Precursor’s head, every facet of every jewel catches fire; the stones burn brightly, outlining the woman’s figure in flaming colours, indicating neck, legs and arms with points of light, red as burning coals, violet as jets of gas, blue as flaming alcohol, white as moonbeams.","All the facets of the jewels kindle under the ardent shafts of light escaping from the head of the Baptist. The stones grow warm, outlining the woman's body with incandescent rays, striking her neck, feet and arms with tongues of fire,—vermilions like coals, violets like jets of gas, blues like flames of alcohol, and whites like star light."
"La décadence de cette ancienne maison avait, sans nul doute, suivi régulièrement son cours ; l'effémination des mâles était allée en s'accentuant ; comme pour achever l'œuvre des âges, les des Esseintes marièrent, pendant deux siècles, leurs enfants entre eux, usant leur reste de vigueur dans les unions consanguines.","The decadence of this old house had, no doubt, taken its regular course; the effeminacy of the males had gone on increasing; as if to complete the work of the ages, the Des Esseintes married their children to each other for two centuries, using up their remaining vigor in consanguineous unions.","Since then, the degeneration3 of this ancient house had clearly followed a regular course, with the men becoming progressively less manly; and over the last two hundred years, as if to complete the ruinous process, the Des Esseintes had taken to intermarrying among themselves, thus using up what little vigour they had left.","It was obvious that the decadence of this family had followed an unvarying course. The effemination of the males had continued with quickened tempo. As if to conclude the work of long years, the Des Esseintes had intermarried for two centuries, using up, in such consanguineous unions, such strength as remained."
"Le tout est de savoir s'y prendre, de savoir concentrer son esprit sur un seul point, de savoir s'abstraire suffisamment pour amener l'hallucination et pouvoir substituer le rêve de la réalité à la réalité même.","The whole thing is to know how to do it, to know how to concentrate one's mind on a single point, to know how to abstract oneself sufficiently to bring on the hallucination and to be able to substitute the dream of reality for reality itself.","The main thing is to know how to set about it, to be able to concentrate your attention on a single detail, to forget yourself sufficiently to bring about the desired hallucination and so substitute the vision of a reality for the reality itself.","The secret lies in knowing how to proceed, how to concentrate deeply enough to produce the hallucination and succeed in substituting the dream reality for the reality itself."
"Il vivait sur lui-même, se nourrissait de sa propre substance, pareil à ces bêtes engourdies, tapies dans un trou, pendant l'hiver; la solitude avait agi sur son cerveau, de même qu'un narcotique. Après l'avoir tout d'abord énervé et tendu, elle amenait une torpeur hantée de songeries vagues; elle annihilait ses desseins, brisait ses volontés, guidait un défilé de rêves qu'il subissait, passivement, sans même essayer de s'y soustraire.","He lived on himself, fed on his own substance, like those torpid beasts crouching in a hole during the winter; loneliness had acted on his brain like a narcotic. After first having irritated and strained him, she brought on a torpor haunted by vague reveries; it annihilated his plans, shattered his will, guided a procession of dreams that he suffered, passively, without even trying to escape them.","He had to live on himself, to feed on his own substance, like those animals that lie torpid in a hole all winter. Solitude had acted on his brain like a narcotic, first exciting and stimulating him, then inducing a languor haunted by vague reveries, vitiating his plans, nullifying his intentions, leading a whole cavalcade of dreams to which he passively submitted, without even trying to get away.","He lived within himself, nourished by his own substance, like some torpid creature which hibernates in caves. Solitude had reacted upon his brain like a narcotic. After having strained and enervated it, his mind had fallen victim to a sluggishness which annihilated his plans, broke his will power and invoked a cortège of vague reveries to which he passively submitted."
"Énervé, mal à l'aise, indigné par l'insignifiance des idées échangées et reçues, il devenait comme ces gens dont a parlé Nicole, qui sont douloureux partout ; il en arrivait à s'écorcher constamment l'épiderme, à souffrir des balivernes patriotiques et sociales débitées, chaque matin, dans les journaux, à s'exagérer la portée des succès qu'un tout-puissant public réserve toujours et quand même aux œuvres écrites sans idées et sans style.","Annoyed, ill at ease, indignant at the insignificance of the ideas exchanged and received, he became like those people whom Nicole spoke of, who are painful everywhere; he came to the point of constantly scratching his skin, of suffering from the patriotic and social nonsense uttered each morning in the newspapers, of exaggerating the scope of the successes that an all-powerful public always and all the same reserves for works written without ideas and without style.","He felt irritable and ill at ease; exasperated by the triviality of the ideas normally bandied about, he came to resemble those people mentioned by Nicole4 who are sensitive to anything and everything. He was constantly coming across some new source of offence, wincing at the patriotic or political twaddle served up in the papers every morning, and exaggerating the importance of the triumphs which an omnipotent public reserves at all times and in all circumstances for works written without thought or style.","Irritated, ill at ease and offended by the poverty of ideas given and received, he became like those people described by Nicole—those who are always melancholy. He would fly into a rage when he read the patriotic and social balderdash retailed daily in the newspapers, and would exaggerate the significance of the plaudits which a sovereign public always reserves for works deficient in ideas and style."
"Il n'y a pas à dire, fit-il, résumant ses réflexions; l'homme, peut en quelques années amener une sélection que la paresseuse nature ne peut jamais produire qu'après des siècles; décidément, par le temps qui court, les horticulteurs sont les seuls et les vrais artistes.","Needless to say, he said, summing up his thoughts; man can in a few years bring about a selection which lazy nature can only produce after centuries; decidedly, these days, horticulturists are the only true artists.","‘There’s no denying it,’ he concluded; ‘in the course of a few years man can operate a selection which easy-going Nature could not conceivably make in less than a few centuries; without the shadow of a doubt, the horticulturists are the only true artists left to us nowadays.’","“It cannot be gainsaid,” he thought, resuming his reflections, “that man in several years is able to effect a selection which slothful nature can produce only after centuries. Decidedly the horticulturists are the real artists nowadays.”"
"La porte s'ouvrit brusquement; dans le lointain, encadrés par le chambranle, des hommes coiffés d'un lampion, avec des joues rasées et une mouche sous la lèvre, parurent, maniant des caisses et charriant des meubles, puis la porte se referma sur le domestique qui emportait des paquets de livres.","The door opened abruptly; in the distance, framed by the doorframe, men wearing lanterns, with shaved cheeks and a fly under their lips, appeared, handling boxes and carrying furniture, then the door closed on the servant who was carrying away parcels of books.","The door suddenly flew open. In the distance, framed in the opening, some men in cocked hats appeared with clean-shaven cheeks and tufts of hair on their chins, trundling packing-cases along and moving furniture; then the door closed again behind the man-servant, who disappeared carrying a bundle of books.","The door was suddenly opened. Clean-shaved men appeared, bringing chests and carrying the furniture; then the door closed once more on the servant who was removing packages of books."
"Deux ouvrages de Barbey d'Aurevilly attisaient spécialement des Esseintes, Le Prêtre marié et Les Diaboliques. D'autres, tels que L'Ensorcelée, Le Chevalier des Touches, Une vieille maîtresse, étaient certainement plus pondérés et plus complets, mais ils laissaient plus froid des Esseintes qui ne s'intéressait réellement qu'aux oeuvres mal portantes, minées et irritées par la fièvre.","Two works by Barbey d'Aurevilly particularly stirred up Esseintes, Le Prêtre marié and Les Diaboliques.

Others, such as the Ensorcelé, the Chevalier des touches and Une Vieille Maîtresse, were certainly more comprehensive and more finely balanced, but they left Des Esseintes untouched, for he was really interested only in unhealthy works which were consumed and irritated by fever."
"Les jardiniers apportèrent encore de nouvelles variétés; elles affectaient, cette fois, une apparence de peau factice sillonnée de fausses veines; et, la plupart, comme rongées par des syphilis et des lèpres, tendaient des chairs livides, marbrées de roséoles, damassées de dartres; d'autres avaient le ton rose vif des cicatrices qui se ferment ou la teinte brune des croûtes qui se forment; d'autres étaient bouillonnées par des cautères, soulevées par des brûlures; d'autres encore montraient des épidermes poilus, creusés par des ulcères et repoussés par des chancres; quelques-unes, enfin, paraissaient couvertes de pansements, plaquées d'axonge noire mercurielle, d'onguents verts de belladone, piquées de grains de poussière, par les micas jaunes de la poudre d'iodoforme.","The gardeners still brought new varieties; they affected, this time, an appearance of artificial skin furrowed with false veins; and, most of them, as eaten away by syphilis and leprosy, tended livid flesh, mottled with roseola, damask with scabs; others had the bright pink tone of closing scars or the brown tint of forming scabs; others were bubbling with cautery, raised by burns; still others showed hairy epidermis, hollowed out by ulcers and pushed back by cankers; some, finally, seemed covered with bandages, plated with black mercurial axong, green ointments of belladonna, pitted with grains of dust, by the yellow micas of iodoform powder.","The gardeners brought in still more varieties, this time affecting the appearance of a factitious skin covered with a network of counterfeit veins. Most of them, as if ravaged by syphilis or leprosy, displayed livid patches of flesh mottled with roseola, damasked with dartre; others had the bright pink colour of a scar that is healing or the brown tint of a scab that is forming; others seemed to have been puffed up by cauteries, blistered by burns; others again revealed hairy surfaces pitted with ulcers and embossed with chancres; and last of all there were some which appeared to be covered with dressings of various sorts, coated with black mercurial lard, plastered with green belladonna ointment, dusted over with the yellow flakes of iodoform powder.","The gardeners brought still other varieties which had the appearance of artificial skin ridged with false veins, and most of them looked as though consumed by syphilis and leprosy, for they exhibited livid surfaces of flesh veined with scarlet rash and damasked with eruptions. Some had the deep red hue of scars that have just closed or the dark tint of incipient scabs. Others were marked with matter raised by scaldings. There were forms which exhibited shaggy skins hollowed by ulcers and relieved by cankers. And a few appeared embossed with wounds, covered with black mercurial hog lard, with green unguents of belladonna smeared with grains of dust and the yellow micas of iodoforme."
"Il mit les maçons sur la maison qu'il avait acquise, puis, brusquement, un jour, sans faire part à qui que ce fût de ses projets, il se débarrassa de son ancien mobilier, congédia ses domestiques et disparut, sans laisser au concierge aucune adresse.","He put the masons on the house he had acquired, then, suddenly, one day, without telling anyone of his plans, he got rid of his old furniture, dismissed his servants and disappeared, without letting the caretaker no address.","He set the local mason to work on the house he had bought; then suddenly, one day, without telling anyone of his plans, he got rid of his furniture, dismissed his servants and disappeared without leaving any address with the concierge.","He put masons to work on the house he had acquired.

"Par un singulier phénomène d'atavisme, le dernier descendant ressemblait à l'antique aïeul, au mignon, dont il avait la barbe en pointe d'un blond extraordinairement pâle et l'expression ambiguë, tout à la fois lasse et habile.","By a singular phenomenon of atavism, the last descendant resembled the ancient ancestor, the cute one, whose pointed beard was extraordinarily pale blond and whose expression was ambiguous, both weary and skilful.","By some freak of heredity, this last scion of the family bore a striking resemblance to his distant ancestor the court favourite, for he had the same exceptionally fair pointed beard, and the same ambiguous expression, at once weary and wily.","By a singular, atavistic reversion, the last descendant resembled the old grandsire, from whom he had inherited the pointed, remarkably fair beard and an ambiguous expression, at once weary and cunning."
"Ici, elle était vraiment fille; elle obéissait à son tempérament de femme ardente et cruelle; elle vivait, plus raffinée et plus sauvage, plus exécrable et plus exquise; elle réveillait plus énergiquement les sens en léthargie de l'homme, ensorcelait, domptait plus sûrement ses volontés, avec son charme de grande fleur vénérienne, poussée dans des couches sacrilèges, élevée dans des serres impies.","Here she was really a girl; she obeyed the temperament of an ardent and cruel woman; she lived, more refined and wilder, more execrable and more exquisite; it awakened more energetically the senses in man's lethargy, bewitched, subdued his will more surely, with its charm of a great venereal flower, grown in sacrilegious beds, raised in impious greenhouses.","Here she was a true harlot, obedient to her passionate and cruel female temperament; here she came to life, more refined yet more savage, more hateful yet more exquisite than before; here she roused the sleeping senses of the male more powerfully, subjugated his will more surely with her charms – the charms of a great venereal flower, grown in a bed of sacrilege, reared in a hot-house of impiety.","It was here that she was indeed Woman, for here she gave rein to her ardent and cruel temperament.

"Aussi des Esseintes se détournait-il de cette littérature, avec horreur; mais, ce n'étaient pas non plus les maîtres modernes du sacerdoce, qui lui offraient des compensations suffisantes pour remédier à ses déboires. Ceux-là étaient des prédicateurs ou des polémistes impeccables et corrects, mais la langue chrétienne avait fini, dans leurs discours et dans leurs livres, par devenir impersonnelle, par se figer dans une rhétorique aux mouvements et aux repos prévus, dans une série de périodes construites d'après un modèle unique. Et en effet, tous les ecclésiastiques écrivaient de même, avec un peu plus ou un peu moins d'abandon ou d'emphase, et la différence était presque nulle entre les grisailles tracées par NN. SS. Dupanloup ou Landriot, La Bouillerie ou Gaume, par Dom Guéranger ou le père Ratisbonne, par Monseigneur Freppel ou Monseigneur Perraud, par les RR. PP. Ravignan ou Gratry, par le jésuite Olivain, le carme Dosithée, le dominicain Didon ou par l'ancien prieur de Saint-Maximin, le Révérend Chocarne.","So Des Esseintes turned away from this literature with horror; but neither were the modern masters of the priesthood offering him sufficient compensation to remedy his setbacks. These were impeccable and correct preachers or polemicists, but the Christian language had ended, in their speeches and in their books, by becoming impersonal, by congealing in a rhetoric with foreseen movements and rests, in a series of periods. built according to a single model. And indeed, all the ecclesiastics wrote the same, with a little more or a little less abandon or emphasis, and the difference was almost nil between the grisailles traced by NN. SS. Dupanloup or Landriot, La Bouillerie or Gaume, by Dom Guéranger or Father Ratisbonne, by Monseigneur Freppel or Monseigneur Perraud, by the RRs. PP. Ravignan or Gratry, by the Jesuit Olivain, the Carmelite Dosithée, the Dominican Dido or by the former prior of Saint-Maximin, the Reverend Chocarne.","As a result, Des Esseintes turned his back in horror on these books. Nor did he think it likely that the priestly writers of modern times could offer him sufficient compensation for all his disappointments. These preachers and polemists wrote impeccable French, but in their sermons and books the Christian idiom had ended up by becoming impersonal and stereotyped, a rhetoric in which every movement and pause was predetermined, a succession of periods copied from a single model. All these ecclesiastics, in fact, wrote alike, with a little more or a little less energy or emphasis, so that there was virtually no difference between the grisailles they turned out, whether they were signed by their Lordships Dupanloup or Landriot, La Bouillerie or Gaume, by Dom Guéranger or Father Ratisbonne, by Bishop Freppel or Bishop Perraud, by Father Ravignan or Father Gratry, by the Jesuit Olivain, the Carmelite Dosithée, the Dominican Didon, or the sometime Prior of Saint-Maximin, the Reverend Father Chocarne.6","So Des Esseintes, horror-stricken at such insipidities, entirely forsook this literature. But neither did he find atonement for his disappointments among the modern masters of the clergy. These latter were one-sided divines or impeccably correct controversialists, but the Christian language in their orations and books had ended by becoming impersonal and congealing into a rhetoric whose every movement and pause was anticipated, in a sequence of periods constructed after a single model. And, in fact, Des Esseintes discovered that all the ecclesiastics wrote in the same manner, with a little more or a little less abandon or emphasis, and there was seldom any variations between the bodiless patterns traded by Dupanloup or Landriot, La Bouillerie or Gaume, by Dom Gueranger or Ratisbonne, by Freppel or Perraud, by Ravignan or Gratry, by Olivain or Dosithée, by Didon or Chocarne."
"À Paris, un fait unique dans l'histoire littéraire s'était produit; cette société agonisante du XVIIIe siècle, qui avait eu des peintres, des sculpteurs, des musiciens, des architectes, pénétrés de ses goûts, imbus de ses doctrines, n'avait pu façonner un réel écrivain qui rendît ses élégances moribondes, qui exprimât le suc de ses joies fébriles, si durement expiées; il avait fallu attendre l'arrivée de de Goncourt, dont le tempérament était fait de souvenirs, de regrets avivés encore par le douloureux spectacle de la misère intellectuelle et des basses aspirations de son temps, pour Que, non seulement dans ses livres d'histoire, mais encore dans une oeuvre nostalgique comme La Faustin, il pût ressusciter l'âme même de cette époque, incarner ses nerveuses délicatesses dans cette actrice, si tourmentée à se presser le coeur et à s'exacerber le cerveau, afin de savourer jusqu'à l'épuisement, les douloureux révulsifs de l'amour et de l'art!","In Paris, a unique event in literary history had occurred; this dying society of the eighteenth century, which had had painters, sculptors, musicians, architects, imbued with its tastes, imbued with its doctrines, had not been able to fashion a real writer who would restore its moribund elegance, who would express the juice of his feverish joys, so harshly expiated; it had been necessary to wait for the arrival of de Goncourt, whose temperament was made of memories, of regrets further heightened by the painful spectacle of the intellectual misery and low aspirations of his time, for Que, not only in his history books , but even in a nostalgic work like La Faustin, he could resurrect the very soul of that era, incarnate its nervous delicacies in this actress, so tormented as to strain her heart and exacerbate her brain, in order to savor until to exhaustion, the painful revulsions of love and art!","In Paris, a phenomenon unique in literary history had come about; the moribund society of the eighteenth century, though it had been well provided with painters, sculptors, musicians and architects, all familiar with its tastes and imbued with its beliefs, had failed to produce a genuine writer capable of rendering its dying graces or manifesting the essence of its feverish pleasures, that were soon to be so cruelly expiated. It had had to wait for Goncourt, whose personality was made up of memories and regrets made still more poignant by the distressing spectacle of the intellectual poverty and base aspirations of his time, to resuscitate, not only in his historical studies but also in a nostalgic work like La Faustin, the very soul of the period, and to embody its neurotic charms in this actress, so painfully eager to torment her heart and torture her brain in order to savour to the point of exhaustion the cruel revulsives of love and art.","At Paris, a fact unique in literary history had been consummated.

"Elle ne bougeait toujours point, il la palpa - elle était morte. Sans doute habituée à une existence sédentaire, à une humble vie passée sous sa pauvre carapace, elle n'avait pu supporter le luxe éblouissant qu'on lui imposait, la rutilante chape dont on l'avait vêtue, les pierreries dont on lui avait pavé le dos, comme un ciboire.","She still didn't move, he felt her - she was dead.

"Comme le disait des Esseintes, jamais, à aucune époque, l'aquarelle n'avait pu atteindre cet éclat de coloris; jamais la pauvreté des couleurs chimiques n'avait ainsi fait jaillir sur le papier des coruscations semblables de pierres, des lueurs pareilles de vitraux frappés de rais de soleil, des fastes aussi fabuleux, aussi aveuglants de tissus et de chairs.","As des Esseintes said, never, at any time, had watercolor been able to attain this brilliance of colour; never had the poverty of chemical colors caused similar coruscations of stone to spring up on the paper, similar gleams of stained-glass windows struck by rays of sunlight, such fabulous, blinding splendor of fabrics and flesh.","It was Des Esseintes’s opinion that never before, in any period, had the art of water-colour produced such brilliant hues; never before had an aquarellist’s wretched chemical pigments been able to make paper sparkle so brightly with precious stones, shine so colourfully with sunlight filtered through stained-glass windows, glitter so splendidly with sumptuous garments, glow so warmly with exquisite fleshtints.","Des Esseintes thought that never before had a water color attained such magnificent coloring; never before had the poverty of colors been able to force jeweled corruscations from paper, gleams like stained glass windows touched by rays of sunlight, splendors of tissue and flesh so fabulous and dazzling."
"Claudien, une sorte d'avatar de Lucain, qui domine tout le IVe siècle avec le terrible clairon de ses vers; un poète forgeant un hexamètre éclatant et sonore, frappant, dans des gerbes d'étincelles, l'épithète d'un coup sec, atteignant une certaine grandeur, soulevant son oeuvre d'un puissant souffle. Dans l'Empire d'Occident qui s'effondre de plus en plus, dans le gâchis des égorgements réitérés qui l'entourent; dans la menace perpétuelle des Barbares qui se pressent maintenant en foule aux portes de l'Empire dont les gonds craquent, il ranime l'antiquité, chante l'enlèvement de Proserpine, plaque ses couleurs vibrantes, passe avec tous ses feux allumés dans l'obscurité qui envahit le monde.","Claudian, a sort of avatar of Lucan, who dominates the whole of the fourth century with the terrible clarion of his verses; a poet forging a dazzling and sonorous hexameter, striking, in sheaves of sparks, the epithet with a sharp blow, reaching a certain grandeur, raising his work with a powerful breath. In the Western Empire which is collapsing more and more, in the mess of repeated slaughters which surround it; in the perpetual threat of the Barbarians who are now pressing in crowds at the gates of the Empire whose hinges are creaking, he revives antiquity, sings of the abduction of Proserpina, paints his vibrant colors, passes with all his fires lit in the darkness that invades the world.","As for Claudian, he appears as a sort of avatar of Lucan, dominating the entire fourth century with the tremendous trumpeting of his verse; a poet hammering out a brilliant, sonorous hexameter on his anvil, beating out each epithet with a single blow amid showers of sparks, attaining a certain grandeur, filling his work with a powerful breath of life. With the Western Empire crumbling to its ruin all about him, amid the horror of the repeated massacres occurring on every side, and under the threat of invasion by the barbarians now pressing in their hordes against the creaking gates of the Empire, he calls Antiquity back to life, sings of the Rape of Proserpine, daubs his canvas with glowing colours and goes by with all his lights blazing through the darkness closing in upon the world.","Claudian, a sort of avatar of Lucan, dominates the fourth century with the terrible clarion of his verses: a poet forging a loud and sonorous hexameter, striking the epithet with a sharp blow amid sheaves of sparks, achieving a certain grandeur which fills his work with a powerful breath.

"En somme, pour la Société, était réputé crime l'acte qui consistait à tuer un être doué de vie; et cependant, en expulsant un foetus, on détruisait un animal, moins formé, moins vivant, et, à coup sûr, moins intelligent et plus laid qu'un chien ou qu'un chat qu'on peut se permettre impunément d'étrangler dès sa naissance!","In short, for the Society, the act which consisted in killing a being endowed with life was considered a crime; and yet, by expelling a fetus, one destroyed an animal, less formed, less alive, and, certainly, less intelligent and uglier than a dog or a cat which one can allow oneself to strangle with impunity as soon as His birth!","In short, society regarded as a crime the act of killing a creature endowed with life; and yet expelling a foetus simply meant destroying an animal that was less developed, less alive, certainly less intelligent and less prepossessing, than a dog or a cat, which could be strangled at birth with impunity.","What Society considered a crime was the act of killing a being endowed with life; and yet, in expelling a foetus, one destroyed an animal that was less formed and living and certainly less intelligent and more ugly than a dog or a cat, although it is permissible to strangle these creatures as soon as they are born."
"Mais ni saint Mathieu, ni saint Marc, ni saint Luc, ni les autres évangélistes ne s'étendaient sur les charmes délirants, sur les actives dépravations de la danseuse.

"À force de tourner et de retourner la question sur toutes ses faces, il conclut que le but à atteindre pouvait se résumer en celui-ci: arranger avec de joyeux objets une chose triste, ou plutôt, tout en lui conservant son caractère de laideur, imprimer à l'ensemble de la pièce, ainsi traitée, une sorte d'élégance et de distinction; renverser l'optique du théâtre dont les vils oripeaux jouent les tissus luxueux et chers; obtenir l'effet absolument opposé, en se servant d'étoffes magnifiques pour donner l'impression d'une guenille; disposer, en un mot, une loge de chartreux qui eût l'air d'être vraie et qui ne le fût, bien entendu, pas.","By twisting and turning the question on all sides, he concluded that the goal to be achieved could be summed up in this: to arrange a sad thing with happy objects, or rather, while preserving its ugly character, impart to the whole piece, thus treated, a sort of elegance and distinction; reverse the optics of the theater whose vile tinsel plays with luxurious and expensive fabrics; obtain the absolutely opposite effect, by using magnificent fabrics to give the impression of a rag; to lay out, in a word, a Carthusian lodge which would appear to be real and which, of course, was not.","After turning the question over in his mind, he eventually came to the conclusion that what he should try to do was this: to employ cheerful means to attain a drab end, or rather, to impress on the room as a whole, treated in this way, a certain elegance and distinction, while yet preserving its essential ugliness. He decided, in fact, to reverse the optical illusion of the stage, where cheap finery plays the part of rich and costly fabrics; to achieve precisely the opposite effect, by using magnificent materials to give the impression of old rags; in short, to fit up a Trappist’s cell that would look like the genuine article, but would of course be nothing of the sort.","By dint of studying the problem in all its phases, he concluded that the end to be attained could thus be stated: to devise a sombre effect by means of cheerful objects, or rather to give a tone of elegance and distinction to the room thus treated, meanwhile preserving its character of ugliness; to reverse the practice of the theatre, whose vile tinsel imitates sumptuous and costly textures; to obtain the contrary effect by use of splendid fabrics; in a word, to have the cell of a Carthusian monk which should possess the appearance of reality without in fact being so."
"Ici, l'hallucination était empreinte d'une tendresse exquise; ce n'était plus les ténébreux mirages de l'auteur américain, c'était une vision tiède et fluide, presque céleste; c'était, dans un genre identique, le contre-pied des Béatrice et des Ligeia, ces mornes et blancs fantômes engendrés par l'inexorable cauchemar du noir opium!","Here the hallucination was stamped with an exquisite tenderness; it was no longer the tenebrous mirages of the American author, it was a lukewarm and fluid, almost celestial vision; it was, in an identical genre, the opposite of the Beatrices and the Ligeias, those gloomy and white phantoms engendered by the inexorable nightmare of black opium!","Here the hallucination was endowed with an exquisite tenderness; there was nothing here of the American author’s gloomy mirages, but a well-nigh heavenly vision of sweetness and warmth, which in an identical style formed the antithesis of Poe’s Beatrices and Ligeias, those pale, unhappy phantoms engendered by the inexorable nightmare of black opium.","Here, the hallucination was marked with an exquisite tenderness; no longer was it the dark mirages of the American author, but the fluid, warm, almost celestial vision; it was in an identical genre, the reverse of the Beatrices and Legeias, those gloomy and dark phantoms engendered by the inexorable nightmare of opium."
"Quelquefois, dans l'après-midi, lorsque, par hasard, des Esseintes était réveillé et debout, il faisait manoeuvrer le jeu des tuyaux et des conduits qui vidaient l'aquarium et le remplissaient à nouveau d'eau pure, et il y faisait verser des gouttes d'essences colorées, s'offrant, à sa guise ainsi, les tons verts ou saumâtres, opalins ou argentés, qu'ont les véritables rivières, suivant la couleur du ciel, l'ardeur plus ou moins vive du soleil, les menaces plus ou moins accentuées de la pluie, suivant, en un mot, l'état de la saison et de l'atmosphère.","Sometimes, in the afternoon, when, by chance, des Esseintes was awake and up, he operated the set of pipes and conduits which emptied the aquarium and refilled it with pure water, and he to pour drops of colored essences, offering themselves, as it pleases, the green or brackish, opaline or silver tones that real rivers have, according to the color of the sky, the more or less intense heat of the sun, the more or less accentuated threats of rain, following, in a word, the state of the season and of the atmosphere.","Sometimes of an afternoon, when Des Esseintes happened to be already up and about, he would set in action the system of pipes and conduits which emptied the aquarium and refilled it with fresh water, and then pour in a few drops of coloured essences, thus producing at will the various tints, green or grey, opaline or silvery, which real rivers take on according to the colour of the sky, the greater or less brilliance of the sun’s rays, the more or less imminent threat of rain – in a word, according to the season and the weather.","Sometimes, when it chanced that Des Esseintes was awake in the afternoon, he operated the stops of the pipes and conduits which emptied the aquarium, replacing it with pure water. Into this, he poured drops of colored liquids that made it green or brackish, opaline or silvery—tones similar to those of rivers which reflect the color of the sky, the intensity of the sun, the menace of rain—which reflect, in a word, the state of the season and atmosphere."
"La seconde moitié du Ve siècle était venue, l'épouvantable époque où d'abominables cahots bouleversaient la terre. Les Barbares saccageaient la Gaule; Rome paralysée, mise au pillage par les Wisigoths, sentait sa vie se glacer, voyait ses parties extrêmes, l'Occident et l'Orient, se débattre dans le sang, s'épuiser de jour en jour.","The second half of the fifth century had come, the dreadful time when abominable jolts upset the earth. The Barbarians sacked Gaul; Paralyzed Rome, plundered by the Visigoths, felt its life freezing, saw its extreme parts, the West and the East, struggling in blood, becoming exhausted day by day.","The second half of the fifth century had arrived, the awful period when appalling shocks convulsed the world. The barbarians were ravaging Gaul while Rome, sacked by the Visigoths, felt the chill of death invade her paralysed body and saw her extremities, the East and the West, thrashing about in pools of blood and growing weaker day by day.","The second half of the fifth century had arrived, the horrible epoch when frightful motions convulsed the earth. The Barbarians sacked Gaul. Paralyzed Rome, pillaged by the Visigoths, felt its life grow feeble, perceived its extremities, the occident and the orient, writhe in blood and grow more exhausted from day to day."
"Dans cet extraordinaire poème, des surprises d'images nouvelles et invues surgissaient, à tout bout de vers, alors que le poète décrivait les élans, les regrets du chèvre-pied contemplant sur le bord du marécage les touffes des roseaux-gardant encore, en un moule éphémère, la forme creuse des naïades qui l'avaient empli.","In this extraordinary poem, surprises of new and unseen images arose, at every end of the verse, while the poet described the impulses, the regrets of the goat-foot contemplating on the edge of the swamp the tufts of reeds-still guarding, in an ephemeral mould, the hollow form of the naiads who had filled it.","In this extraordinary poem, new and surprising images occurred in almost every line when the poet came to describe the longings and regrets of the goat-footed god, standing on the edge of the swamp and looking at the clumps of rushes that still retained an ephemeral impression of the rounded forms of the naiads who had rested there.","In this extraordinary poem, surprising and unthought of images leaped up at the end of each line, when the poet described the elations and regrets of the faun contemplating, at the edge of a fen, the tufts of reeds still preserving, in its transitory mould, the form made by the naiades who had occupied it."

"Les médecins parlaient d'amusement, de distraction; et avec qui, et, avec quoi, voulaient-ils donc qu'il s'égayât et qu'il se plût?","The doctors spoke of amusement, of distraction; and with whom, and with what, did they want him to have fun and enjoy himself?","The doctors spoke of amusement and relaxation, but with whom, with what, did they expect him to have fun and enjoy himself?","The physicians spoke of amusement and distraction. With whom, and with what did they wish him to distract and amuse himself?"
"Pris d'un indéfinissable malaise, devant ces dessins, comme devant certains Proverbes de Goya qu'ils rappelaient; comme au sortir aussi d'une lecture d'Edgar Poe dont Odilon Redon semblait avoir transposé, dans un art différent, les mirages d'hallucination et les effets de peur, il se frottait les yeux et contemplait une rayonnante figure qui, du milieu de ces planches agitées, se levait sereine et calme, une figure de la Mélancolie, assise, devant le disque d'un soleil, sur des rochers, dans une pose accablée et morne.","Taken by an indefinable uneasiness, in front of these drawings, as in front of certain Proverbs of Goya which they recalled; as also coming out of a reading of Edgar Poe whose mirages of hallucination and effects of fear Odilon Redon seemed to have transposed into a different art, he rubbed his eyes and contemplated a radiant figure which, from the midst of serene and calm rose from these agitated planks, a figure of Melancholy, seated before the disc of a sun, on the rocks, in a dejected and gloomy pose.","Overcome by an indefinable malaise at the sight of these drawings – the same sort of malaise he experienced when he looked at certain rather similar Proverbs by Goya,6 or read some of Edgar Allan Poe’s stories, whose terrifying or hallucinating effects Odilon Redon seemed to have transposed into a different art – he would rub his eyes and turn to gaze at a radiant figure which, in the midst of all these frenzied pictures, stood out calm and serene: the figure of Melancholy, seated on some rocks before a disk-like sun, in a mournful and despondent attitude.","Seized with an indefinable uneasiness in the presence of these sketches, the same sensation caused by certain Proverbs of Goya which they recalled, or by the reading of Edgar Allen Poe's tales, whose mirages of hallucination and effects of fear Odilon Redon seemed to have transposed to a different art, he rubbed his eyes and turned to contemplate a radiant figure which, amid these tormenting sketches, arose serene and calm—a figure of Melancholy seated near the disk of a sun, on the rocks, in a dejected and gloomy posture."
"Anéanti, des Esseintes avait dégobillé du sang plein une cuvette, refusé, d'un geste, à la vieille femme qui rentrait, l'offrande de son chicot qu'elle s'apprêtait à envelopper dans un journal et il avait fui, payant deux francs, lançant, à son tour, des crachats sanglants sur les marches, et il s'était retrouvé, dans la rue, joyeux, rajeuni de dix ans, s'intéressant aux moindres choses.","Devastated, Des Esseintes had gulped a basin full of blood, refused, with a gesture, to the old woman who was returning, the offering of her snag which she was about to wrap in a newspaper, and he had fled, paying two outspoken, spitting blood on the steps in his turn, and he found himself in the street, joyful, ten years younger, interested in the smallest things.","Utterly exhausted, Des Esseintes had spat out a basinful of blood, waved away the old woman who came in to offer him his tooth, which she was prepared to wrap up in a piece of newspaper, and after paying two francs had fled, adding his contribution to the bloody spittle on the stairs. But out in the street he had recovered his spirits, feeling ten years younger and taking an interest in the most insignificant things.","Breathing heavily, his form filling the window, he brandished at one end of his forceps, a blue tooth with blood at one end. Faint and prostrate, Des Esseintes spat blood into a basin, refused with a gesture, the tooth which the old woman was about to wrap in a piece of paper and fled, after paying two francs. Expectorating blood, in his turn, down the steps, he at length found himself in the street, joyous, feeling ten years younger, interested in every little occurrence."
"Il n'avait pas eu le courage de se plonger dans ce bain de multitude, pour aller écouter du Berlioz dont quelques fragments l'avaient pourtant subjugué par leurs exaltations passionnées et leurs bondissantes fougues, et il savait pertinemment aussi qu'il n'était pas une scène, pas même une phrase d'un opéra du prodigieux Wagner qui pût être impunément détachée de son ensemble.","He hadn't had the courage to immerse himself in this bath of multitude, to go and listen to Berlioz, a few fragments of which had nonetheless captivated him with their passionate exaltations and their leaping ardor, and he also knew perfectly well that he was not not a scene, not even a phrase from an opera by the prodigious Wagner which could be detached from its whole with impunity.","He had never had the courage to plunge into this mob-bath to listen to Berlioz, even though he admired some fragments of his work for their passionate ardour and fiery spirit; and he was well aware that there was not a single scene, not even a single phrase, in any of the mighty Wagner’s operas that could be divorced from its context with impunity.1","He had always lacked the courage to plunge in this mob-bath so as to listen to Berlioz' compositions, several fragments of which had bewitched him by their passionate exaltations and their vigorous fugues, and he was certain that there was not one single scene, not even a phrase of one of the operas of the amazing Wagner which could with impunity be detached from its whole."
"Ce qu'il voulait, c'étaient des couleurs dont l'expression s'affirmât aux lumières factices des lampes; peu lui importait même qu'elles fussent, aux lueurs du jour, insipides ou rêches, car il ne vivait guère que la nuit, pensant qu'on était mieux chez soi, plus seul, et que l'esprit ne s'excitait et ne crépitait réellement qu'au contact voisin de l'ombre; il trouvait aussi une jouissance particulière à se tenir dans une chambre largement éclairée, seul éveillé et debout, au milieu des maisons enténébrées et endormies, une sorte de jouissance où il entrait peut-être une pointe de vanité, une satisfaction toute singulière, que connaissent les travailleurs attardés alors que, soulevant les rideaux des fenêtres, ils s'aperçoivent autour d'eux que tout est éteint, que tout est muet, que tout est mort.","What he wanted were colors whose expression would assert itself in the artificial lights of the lamps; it mattered little even to him whether they were, in the light of day, insipid or rough, for he hardly lived except at night, thinking that one was better at home, more alone, and that the mind was not excited and really crackled only in close contact with the shadow; he also found a particular pleasure in being in a brightly lit room, alone awake and standing, in the middle of darkened and sleeping houses, a kind of pleasure into which there entered perhaps a touch of vanity, a quite singular satisfaction, which the belated workers while, lifting the curtains of the windows, they realize around them that everything is extinguished, that everything is mute, that everything is dead.","What he wanted was colours which would appear stronger and clearer in artificial light.4 He did not particularly care if they looked crude or insipid in daylight, for he lived most of his life at night, holding that night afforded greater intimacy and isolation and that the mind was truly roused and stimulated only by awareness of the dark; moreover he derived a peculiar pleasure from being in a well-lighted room when all the surrounding houses were wrapped in sleep and darkness, a sort of enjoyment in which vanity may have played some small part, a very special feeling of satisfaction familiar to those who sometimes work late at night and draw aside the curtains to find that all around them the world is dark, silent and dead.","He desired colors whose expressiveness would be displayed in the artificial light of lamps. To him it mattered not at all if they were lifeless or crude in daylight, for it was at night that he lived, feeling more completely alone then, feeling that only under the protective covering of darkness did the mind grow really animated and active. He also experienced a peculiar pleasure in being in a richly illuminated room, the only patch of light amid the shadow-haunted, sleeping houses. This was a form of enjoyment in which perhaps entered an element of vanity, that peculiar pleasure known to late workers when, drawing aside the window curtains, they perceive that everything about them is extinguished, silent, dead."
"à part ces quelques livres, la littérature française commençait, dans sa bibliothèque, avec le siècle.","Apart from these few books, French literature began, in its library, with the century.","Apart from these few books, French literature, so far as his library was concerned, started at the beginning of the nineteenth century.","Apart from such books as these, French literature began in his library with the nineteenth century."
"Il s'apercevait enfin que les raisonnements du pessimisme étaient impuissants à le soulager, que l'impossible croyance en une vie future serait seule apaisante.","He finally realized that the reasonings of pessimism were powerless to relieve him, that the impossible belief in a future life would alone be soothing.","He realized at last that the arguments of pessimism were powerless to comfort him, that only the impossible belief in a future life could bring him peace of mind.","He came at last to perceive that the reasonings of pessimism availed little in comforting him, that impossible faith in a future life alone would pacify him."
"Ainsi, par haine, par mépris de son enfance, il avait pendu au plafond de cette pièce une petite cage en fil d'argent où un grillon enfermé chantait comme dans les cendres des cheminées du château de Lourps; quand il écoutait ce cri tant de fois entendu, toutes les soirées contraintes et muettes chez sa mère, tout l'abandon d'une jeunesse souffrante et refoulée, se bousculaient devant lui, et alors, aux secousses de la femme qu'il caressait machinalement et dont les paroles ou le rire rompaient sa vision et le ramenaient brusquement dans la réalité, dans le boudoir à terre, un tumulte se levait en son âme, un besoin de vengeance des tristesses endurées, une rage de salir par des turpitudes des souvenirs de famille, un désir furieux de panteler sur des coussins de chair, d'épuiser jusqu'à leurs dernières gouttes, les plus véhémentes et les plus âcres des folies charnelles.","Thus, out of hatred, out of contempt for his childhood, he had hung from the ceiling of this room a small cage of silver wire in which a cricket, locked up, was singing as if in the ashes of the chimneys of the chateau of Lourps; when he listened to this cry so often heard, all the constrained and mute evenings at his mother's, all the abandonment of a suffering and repressed youth, jostled before him, and then, to the jolts of the woman he mechanically caressed and whose words or laughter broke his vision and brought him abruptly back to reality, in the boudoir on the ground, a tumult arose in his soul, a need for revenge for the sadness endured, a rage to sully with turpitude the memories of family, a furious desire to pant on cushions of flesh, to exhaust to their last drops, the most vehement and the most acrid of carnal follies.","Thus, in hateful and contemptuous memory of his childhood, he had suspended from the ceiling of this room a little silver cage containing a cricket which chirped as other crickets had once chirped among the embers in the fireplaces at the Château de Lourps. Whenever he heard this familiar sound, all the silent evenings of constraint he had spent in his mother’s company and all the misery he had endured in the course of a lonely, unhappy childhood came back to haunt him. And when the movements of the woman he was mechanically caressing suddenly dispelled these memories and her words or laughter brought him back to the present reality of the boudoir, then his soul was swept by tumultuous emotions: a longing to take vengeance for the boredom inflicted on him in the past, a craving to sully what memories he retained of his family with acts of sensual depravity, a furious desire to expend his lustful frenzy on cushions of soft flesh and to drain the cup of sensuality to its last and bitterest dregs.","As a souvenir of the hated days of his childhood, he had suspended from the ceiling a small silver-wired cage where a captive cricket sang as if in the ashes of the chimneys of the Château de Lourps. Listening to the sound he had so often heard before, he lived over again the silent evenings spent near his mother, the wretchedness of his suffering, repressed youth. And then, while he yielded to the voluptuousness of the woman he mechanically caressed, whose words or laughter tore him from his revery and rudely recalled him to the moment, to the boudoir, to reality, a tumult arose in his soul, a need of avenging the sad years he had endured, a mad wish to sully the recollections of his family by shameful action, a furious desire to pant on cushions of flesh, to drain to their last dregs the most violent of carnal vices."
"Son mépris de l'humanité s'accrut ; il comprit enfin que le monde est, en majeure partie, composé de sacripants et d'imbéciles. Décidément, il n'avait aucun espoir de découvrir chez autrui les mêmes aspirations et les mêmes haines, aucun espoir de s'accoupler avec une intelligence qui se complût, ainsi que la sienne, dans une studieuse décrépitude, aucun espoir d'adjoindre un esprit pointu et chantourné tel que le sien, à celui d'un écrivain ou d'un lettré.","His contempt for humanity increased; he finally understood that the world is, for the most part, made up of rascals and imbeciles. Decidedly, he had no hope of discovering in others the same aspirations and the same hatreds, no hope of mating with an intelligence which took pleasure, as well as his own, in a studious decrepitude, no hope of adding a spirit pointed and contoured like his, to that of a writer or a scholar.","His contempt for humanity grew fiercer, and at last he came to realize that the world is made up mostly of fools and scoundrels. It became perfectly clear to him that he could entertain no hope of finding in someone else the same aspirations and antipathies; no hope of linking up with a mind which, like his own, took pleasure in a life of studious decrepitude; no hope of associating an intelligence as sharp and wayward as his own with that of any author or scholar.","He reached the conclusion that the world, for the most part, was composed of scoundrels and imbeciles. Certainly, he could not hope to discover in others aspirations and aversions similar to his own, could not expect companionship with an intelligence exulting in a studious decrepitude, nor anticipate meeting a mind as keen as his among the writers and scholars."
"Il se procurait ainsi, en ne bougeant point, les sensations rapides, presque instantanées, d'un voyage au long cours, et ce plaisir du déplacement qui n'existe, en somme, que par le souvenir et presque jamais dans le présent, à la minute même où il s'effectue, il le humait pleinement, à l'aise, sans fatigue, sans tracas, dans cette cabine dont le désordre apprêté, dont la tenue transitoire et l'installation comme temporaire correspondaient assez exactement avec le séjour passager qu'il y faisait, avec le temps limité de ses repas, et contrastait, d'une manière absolue, avec son cabinet de travail, une pièce définitive, rangée, bien assise, outillée pour le ferme maintien d'une existence casanière.","He thus obtained, by not moving, the rapid, almost instantaneous sensations of a long journey, and this pleasure of displacement which exists, in short, only by memory and almost never in the present, in the very minute it took place, he inhaled it fully, at ease, without fatigue, without hassle, in this cabin whose prepared disorder, whose transient outfit and temporary installation corresponded quite exactly with the passenger stay that he made there, with the limited time for his meals, and in absolute contrast to his study, a definitive room, tidy, well seated, equipped for the firm maintenance of a homelike existence.","By these means he was able to enjoy quickly, almost simultaneously, all the sensations of a long sea-voyage, without ever leaving home; the pleasure of moving from place to place, a pleasure which in fact exists only in recollection of the past and hardly ever in experience of the present, this pleasure he could savour in full and in comfort, without fatigue or worry, in this cabin whose deliberate disorder, impermanent appearance and makeshift appointments corresponded fairly closely to the flying visits he paid it and the limited time he gave his meals, while it offered a complete contrast to his study, a permanent, orderly, well-established room, admirably equipped to maintain and uphold a stay-at-home existence.","Thus, without stirring, he enjoyed the rapid motions of a long sea voyage. The pleasure of travel, which only exists as a matter of fact in retrospect and seldom in the present, at the instant when it is being experienced, he could fully relish at his ease, without the necessity of fatigue or confusion, here in this cabin whose studied disorder, whose transitory appearance and whose seemingly temporary furnishings corresponded so well with the briefness of the time he spent there on his meals, and contrasted so perfectly with his study, a well-arranged, well-furnished room where everything betokened a retired, orderly existence."
"Tout n'est que syphilis, songea des Esseintes, l'oeil attiré, rivé sur les horribles tigrures des Caladium que caressait un rayon de jour. Et il eut la brusque vision d'une humanité sans cesse travaillée par le virus des anciens âges. Depuis le commencement du monde, de pères en fils, toutes les créatures se transmettaient l'inusable héritage, l'éternelle maladie qui a ravagé les ancêtres de l'homme, qui a creusé jusqu'aux os maintenant exhumés des vieux fossiles!","It's all syphilis, thought Des Esseintes, his eye drawn, riveted on the horrible streaks of the Caladiums caressed by a ray of daylight. And he had the sudden vision of a humanity ceaselessly tormented by the virus of the ancient ages. Since the beginning of the world, from father to son, all creatures passed on the indestructible heritage, the eternal disease which ravaged the ancestors of man, which dug right down to the bones now exhumed from old fossils!","‘It all comes down to syphilis in the end,’3 Des Esseintes reflected, as his gaze was drawn and held by the horrible markings of the Caladiums, over which a shaft of daylight was playing. And he had a sudden vision of the unceasing torments inflicted on humanity by the virus of distant ages. Ever since the beginning of the world, from generation to generation, all living creatures had handed down the inexhaustible heritage, the everlasting disease that ravaged the ancestors of man and even ate into the bones of the old fossils that were being dug up at the present time.","“All is syphilis,” thought Des Esseintes, his eye riveted upon the horrible streaked stainings of the Caladium plants caressed by a ray of light. And he beheld a sudden vision of humanity consumed through the centuries by the virus of this disease. Since the world's beginnings, every single creature had, from sire to son, transmitted the imperishable heritage, the eternal malady which has ravaged man's ancestors and whose effects are visible even in the bones of old fossils that have been exhumed."

"Les médecins consultés l'effrayèrent. Il était temps d'enrayer cette vie, de renoncer à ces manœuvres qui alitaient ses forces. Il demeura, pendant quelque temps, tranquille ; mais bientôt le cervelet s'exalta, appela de nouveau aux armes. De même que ces gamines qui, sous le coup de la puberté, s'affament de mets altérés ou abjects, il en vint à rêver, à pratiquer les amours exceptionnelles, les joies déviées ; alors, ce fut la fin ; comme satisfaits d'avoir tout épuisé, comme fourbus de fatigues, ses sens tombèrent en léthargie, l'impuissance fut proche.","The doctors consulted frightened him. It was time to put an end to this life, to give up these maneuvers which were stifling his strength. He remained quiet for some time; but soon the cerebellum was exalted, again calling to arms. Like those little girls who, under the influence of puberty, starve themselves for altered or abject dishes, he came to dream, to practice exceptional loves, diverted joys; then, it was the end; as if satisfied to have exhausted everything, as exhausted with fatigue, his senses fell into lethargy, impotence was near.","The doctors he consulted terrified him with warnings that it was time he changed his way of life and gave up these practices which were sapping his vitality. For a little while he led a quiet life, but soon his brain took fire again and sent out a fresh call to arms. Like girls who at the onset of puberty hanker after weird or disgusting dishes, he began to imagine and then to indulge in unnatural love-affairs and perverse pleasures. But this was too much for him. His overfatigued senses, as if satisfied that they had tasted every imaginable experience, sank into a state of lethargy; and impotence was not far off.","The physicians whom he consulted frightened him. It was high time to check his excesses and renounce those pursuits which were dissipating his reserve of strength! For a while he was at peace, but his brain soon became over-excited. Like those young girls who, in the grip of puberty, crave coarse and vile foods, he dreamed of and practiced perverse loves and pleasures. This was the end! As though satisfied with having exhausted everything, as though completely surrendering to fatigue, his senses fell into a lethargy and impotence threatened him."
"Il dépensa le double des autres, puis, quand sa femme, à court d'argent pour ses toilettes, se lassa d'habiter cette rotonde et s'en fut occuper un appartement carré, moins cher, aucun meuble ne put ni cadrer ni tenir. Peu à peu, cet encombrant mobilier devint une source d'interminables ennuis; l'entente déjà fêlée par une vie commune, s'effrita de semaine en semaine; ils s'indignèrent, se reprochant mutuellement de ne pouvoir demeurer dans ce salon où les canapés et les consoles ne touchaient pas aux murs et branlaient aussitôt qu'on les frôlait, malgré leurs cales. Les fonds manquèrent pour des réparations du reste presque impossibles. Tout devint sujet à aigreurs et à querelles, tout depuis les tiroirs qui avaient joué dans les meubles mal d'aplomb jusqu'aux larcins de la bonne qui profitait de l'inattention des disputes pour piller la caisse; bref, la vie leur fut insupportable; lui, s'égaya au dehors; elle, quêta, parmi les expédients de l'adultère, l'oubli de sa vie pluvieuse et plate. D'un commun avis, ils résilièrent leur bail et requérirent la séparation de corps.","He spent twice as much as the others, then, when his wife, short of money for her clothes, got tired of living in this rotunda and went to occupy a less expensive square apartment, no piece of furniture could fit or hold . Little by little, this cumbersome furniture became a source of interminable annoyance; the harmony, already cracked by a common life, crumbled from week to week; they were indignant, reproaching each other for not being able to remain in this living room where the sofas and the consoles did not touch the walls and shook as soon as one touched them, in spite of their wedges. Funds were lacking for repairs that were almost impossible. Everything became subject to bitterness and quarrels, everything from the drawers that had played in the furniture that was out of balance to the larceny of the maid who took advantage of the inattention of the disputes to loot the cash register; in short, life was unbearable to them; he was cheerful outside; she sought, among the expedients of adultery, the oblivion of her rainy and flat life. By common consent, they terminated their lease and requested legal separation.","He spent twice as much as anybody else; and then, when his wife, finding herself short of money for new dresses, got tired of living in this rotunda, and took herself off to a flat with ordinary square rooms at a lower rent, not a single piece of furniture would fit in or stand up properly. Soon the bothersome things were giving rise to endless annoyances; the bond between husband and wife, already worn thin by the inevitable irritations of a shared life, grew more tenuous week by week; and there were angry scenes and mutual recriminations as they came to realize the impossibility of living in a sitting-room where sofas and console-tables would not go against the walls and wobbled at the slightest touch, however many blocks and wedges were used to steady them. There was not enough money to pay for alterations, and even if there had been, these would have been almost impossible to carry out. Everything became a ground for high words and squabbles, from the drawers that had stuck in the rickety furniture to the petty thefts of the maid-servant, who took advantage of the constant quarrels between her master and mistress to raid the cash-box. In short, their life became unbearable; he went out in search of amusement, while she looked to adultery to provide compensation for the drizzly dreariness of her life. Finally, by mutual consent, they cancelled their lease and petitioned for a legal separation.","Although he experienced no inclination for the state of grace, he felt a genuine sympathy for those souls immured in monasteries, persecuted by a vengeful society which can forgive neither the merited scorn with which it inspires them, nor the desire to expiate, to atone by long silences, for the ever growing shamelessness of its ridiculous or trifling gossipings."
"Il n'y tint plus, et brusquement il s'était décidé, un jour. Sa hâte fut telle qu'il prit la fuite bien avant l'heure, voulant se dérober au présent, se sentir bousculé dans un brouhaha de rue, dans un vacarme de foule et de gare.","He couldn't stand it any longer, and suddenly he had made up his mind one day. His haste was such that he fled well before his time, wanting to escape from the present, to feel jostled in the hubbub of the street, in the din of the crowd and the train station.","Finally he could stand it no longer, and he had suddenly decided to go. Indeed, he was in such a hurry to be off that he fled from home with hours to spare, eager to escape into the future and to plunge into the hurly-burly of the streets, the hubbub of crowded stations.","One day, able to endure it no longer, he had instantly decided. Such was his haste that he even took flight before the designated time, for he wished to shun the present moment, wished to find himself jostled and shouldered in the hubbub of crowded streets and railway stations."
"Un trône se dressait, pareil au maître-autel d'une cathédrale, sous d'innombrables voûtes jaillissant de colonnes trapues ainsi que des piliers romans, émaillées de briques polychromes, serties de mosaïques, incrustées de lapis et de sardoines, dans un palais semblable à une basilique d'une architecture tout à la fois musulmane et byzantine.","A throne stood, like the high altar of a cathedral, under innumerable vaults springing from squat columns as well as Romanesque pillars, enamelled with polychrome bricks, set with mosaics, inlaid with lapis and sard, in a similar palace. to a basilica of both Muslim and Byzantine architecture.","This painting showed a throne like the high altar of a cathedral standing beneath a vaulted ceiling – a ceiling crossed by countless arches springing from thick-set, almost Romanesque columns, encased in polychromic brickwork, encrusted with mosaics, set with lapis lazuli and sardonyx – in a palace which resembled a basilica built in both the Moslem and the Byzantine styles.","A throne, resembling the high altar of a cathedral, reared itself beneath innumerable vaults leaping from heavy Romanesque pillars, studded with polychromatic bricks, set with mosaics, incrusted with lapis lazuli and sardonyx, in a palace that, like a basilica, was at once Mohammedan and Byzantine in design."
"Or, Dieu se refusait à descendre dans la fécule. C'était un fait indéniable, sûr; dans le second tome de sa théologie morale, S.E. le cardinal Gousset, avait, lui aussi, longuement traité cette question de la fraude au point de vue divin; et, suivant l'incontestable autorité de ce maître, l'on ne pouvait consacrer le pain composé de farine d'avoine, de blé sarrasin, ou d'orge, et si le cas demeurait au moins douteux pour le pain de seigle, il ne pouvait soutenir aucune discussion, prêter à aucun litige, quand il s'agissait d'une fécule qui, selon l'expression ecclésiastique, n'était, à aucun titre, matière compétente du sacrement.","However, God refused to descend into the starch. It was an undeniable, sure fact; in the second volume of his moral theology, H.E. Cardinal Gousset had also dealt at length with this question of fraud from the divine point of view; and, according to the indisputable authority of this master, one could not consecrate bread made from oat flour, buckwheat wheat, or barley, and if the case remained at least doubtful for rye bread, it could not support any discussion, lend itself to any litigation, when it was a question of starch which, according to the ecclesiastical expression, was, by no means, competent matter of the sacrament.","Now God refused to come down to earth in the form of potato-flour; that was an undeniable, indisputable fact. In the second volume of his Moral Theology, His Eminence Cardinal Gousset had also dealt at length with this question of fraud from the divine point of view; according to this unimpeachable authority it was quite impossible to consecrate bread made of oatmeal, buckwheat or barley, and if there was at least some doubt in the case of rye bread, there could be no doubt or argument about potato-flour, which, to use the ecclesiastic phrase, was in no sense a competent substance for the Blessed Sacrament.","Now, God refused to descend into the fecula. It was an undeniable fact and a certain one. In the second volume of his treatise on moral theology, Cardinal Gousset had dwelt at length on this question of the fraud practiced from the divine point of view. And, according to the incontestable authority of this master, one could not consecrate bread made of flour of oats, buckwheat or barley, and if the matter of using rye be less doubtful, no argument was possible in regard to the fecula which, according to the ecclesiastic expression, was in no way fit for sacramental purposes."
"à coup sûr, il regrettait amèrement l'Eustion et l'Albutia, ces deux ouvrages de Pétrone que mentionne Planciade Fulgence et qui sont à jamais perdus; mais le bibliophile qui était en lui consolait le lettré, maniant avec des mains dévotes la superbe édition qu'il possédait du Satyricon, l'in-8 portant le millésime 1585 et le nom de J.

"Mais, pour l'instant, il demeurait indifférent, regardant d'un oeil atone cette bouteille trapue, d'un vert sombre, qui, à d'autres moments, évoquait, en lui, les prieurés du moyen âge, avec son antique panse monacale, sa tête et son col vêtus d'une capuche de parchemin, son cachet de cire rouge écartelé de trois mitres d'argent sur champ d'azur et scellé, au goulot, ainsi qu'une bulle, par des liens de plomb, avec son étiquette écrite en un latin retentissant, sur un papier jauni et comme déteint par les temps: liquor Monachorum Benedictinorum Abbatiae Fiscanensis.","But, for the moment, he remained indifferent, staring blankly at this squat bottle, dark green, which, at other times, evoked in him the priories of the Middle Ages, with its ancient belly. monastic, its head and collar covered with a parchment hood, its seal of red wax quartered with three silver miters on a field of azure and sealed, at the neck, like a bull, by lead ties, with its label written in a resounding Latin, on a yellowed paper and as if faded by the times: liquor Monachorum Benedictinorum Abbatiae Fiscanensis.","But for the moment he remained unmoved, and just stared dully at the squat, dark-green bottle, which normally conjured up visions of medieval priories for him, with its antique monkish paunch, its head and neck wrapped in a parchment cowl, its red seal quartered with three silver mitres on a field azure and fastened to the neck with lead like a Papal bull, its label inscribed in sonorous Latin, on paper apparently yellowed and faded with age: Liquor Monachorum Benedictinorum Abbatiae Fiscanensis.","But at this moment he remained indifferent, gazing with lack-lustre, staring eyes at this squat, dark-green bottle which, at other times, had brought before him images of the medieval priories by its old-fashioned monkish paunch, its head and neck covered with a parchment hood, its red wax stamp quartered with three silver mitres against a field of azure and fastened at the neck, like a papal bull, with bands of lead, its label inscribed in sonorous Latin, on paper that seemed to have yellowed with age: Liquor Monachorum Benedictinorum Abbatiae Fiscannensis."
"En effet, depuis quelques jours, il se trouvait dans un état d'âme indescriptible. Il croyait pendant une seconde, allait d'instinct à la religion, puis au moindre raisonnement son attirance vers la foi s'évaporait; mais il restait, malgré tout, plein de trouble.","In fact, for several days, he had been in an indescribable state of mind.

At moments, he felt himself veering towards religion. Then, at the slightest approach of reason, his faith would dissolve. Yet he remained deeply troubled."
"La maladie reprit sa marche; des phénomènes inconnus l'escortèrent. Après les cauchemars, les hallucinations de l'odorat, les troubles de la vue, la toux rèche, réglée de même qu'une horloge, les bruits des artères et du coeur et les suées froides, surgirent les illusions de l'ouïe, ces altérations qui ne se produisent que dans la dernière période du mal.","The disease resumed its course; unknown phenomena escorted him.

"Ces vers, il les aimait comme il aimait les oeuvres de ce poète qui, dans un siècle de suffrage universel et dans un temps de lucre, vivait à l'écart des lettres, abrité de la sottise environnante par son dédain, se complaisant, loin du monde, aux surprises de l'intellect, aux visions de sa cervelle, raffinant sur des pensées déjà spécieuses, les greffant de finesses byzantines, les perpétuant en des déductions légèrement indiquées que reliait à peine un imperceptible fil.","These verses, he loved them as he loved the works of this poet who, in a century of universal suffrage and in a time of lucre, lived apart from letters, sheltered from the surrounding stupidity by his disdain, taking pleasure, far from of the world, to the surprises of the intellect, to the visions of his brain, refining on already specious thoughts, grafting them with Byzantine subtleties, perpetuating them in slightly indicated deductions which were barely connected by an imperceptible thread.","He loved these verses as he loved all the works of this poet who, in an age of universal suffrage and a time of commercial greed, lived outside the world of letters, sheltered from the raging folly all around him by his lofty scorn; taking pleasure, far from society, in the caprices of the mind and the visions of his brain; refining upon thoughts that were already subtle enough, grafting Byzantine niceties on them, perpetuating them in deductions that were barely hinted at and loosely linked by an imperceptible thread.","These lines he loved, as he loved the works of this poet who, in an age of democracy devoted to lucre, lived his solitary and literary life sheltered by his disdain from the encompassing stupidity, delighting, far from society, in the surprises of the intellect, in cerebral visions, refining on subtle ideas, grafting Byzantine delicacies upon them, perpetuating them in suggestions lightly connected by an almost imperceptible thread."
"Par instants, des ondées crevaient et engloutissaient la vallée sous des torrents de pluie.","From time to time, showers burst and engulfed the valley under torrents of rain.","Every now and then there would be a sudden downpour, and the valley would disappear under torrents of rain.","At intervals, showers swept downward, engulfing the valley with torrents of rain."
"Ce jour-là, le firmament avait changé d'aspect. Les flots d'encre s'étaient volatilisés et taris, les aspérités des nuages s'étaient fondues, le ciel était uniformément plat, couvert d'une taie saumâtre. Peu à peu, cette taie parut descendre, une brume d'eau enveloppa la campagne; la pluie ne croula plus, par cataractes, ainsi que la veille, mais elle tomba, sans relâche, fine, pénétrante, aiguë, délayant les allées, gâchant les routes, joignant avec ses fils innombrables la terre au ciel; la lumière se brouilla; un jour livide éclaira le village maintenant transformé en un lac de boue pointillé par les aiguilles de l'eau qui piquaient de gouttes de vif argent le liquide fangeux des flaques; dans la désolation de la nature, toutes les couleurs se fanèrent, laissant seuls les toits luire sur les tons éteints des murs.","That day, the firmament had changed in appearance. The streams of ink had evaporated and dried up, the asperities of the clouds had melted, the sky was uniformly flat, covered with a brackish layer. Gradually, this pillowcase seemed to descend, a mist of water enveloped the countryside; the rain no longer fell, in cataracts, as it did the day before, but it fell, relentlessly, fine, penetrating, sharp, diluting the paths, marring the roads, joining with its innumerable threads the earth to the sky; the light blurred; a livid day lit up the village now transformed into a lake of mud dotted by the needles of water which pricked with drops of quicksilver the muddy liquid of the puddles; in the desolation of nature, all the colors faded, leaving only the roofs to shine on the dull tones of the walls.","But that particular day, the sky had changed in appearance: the floods of ink had dried up, the clouds had lost their rugged outlines and the heavens were now covered with a flat, opaque film. This film seemed to be falling ever lower, and at the same time the countryside was enveloped in a watery mist; the rain no longer cascaded down as it had done the day before, but fell in a fine, cold, unrelenting spray, swamping the lanes, submerging the roads, joining heaven and earth with its countless threads. Daylight in the village dimmed to a ghastly twilight, while the village itself looked like a lake of mud, speckled by the quicksilver needles of rain pricking the surface of the slimy puddles.","Today, the appearance of the heavens had changed. The rivers of ink had evaporated and vanished, and the harsh contours of the clouds had softened. The sky was uniformly flat and covered with a brackish film. Little by little, this film seemed to drop, and a watery haze covered the country side. The rain no longer fell in cataracts as on the preceding evening; instead, it fell incessantly, fine, sharp and penetrating; it inundated the walks, covered the roads with its innumerable threads which joined heaven and earth. The livid sky threw a wan leaden light on the village which was now transformed into a lake of mud pricked by needles of water that dotted the puddles with drops of bright silver."
"Parmi les rappels qui l'assiégeaient, dans sa solitude, celui de ce réciproque attachement dominait les autres. Toute la levure d'égarement que peut détenir un cerveau surexcité par la névrose, fermentait, et, à se complaire ainsi dans ces souvenirs, dans cette délectation morose, comme la théologie appelle cette récurrence des vieux opprobres, il mêlait aux visions physiques des ardeurs spirituelles cinglées par l'ancienne lecture des casuistes, des Busembaum et des Diana, des Liguori et des Sanchez, traitant des péchés contre le 6e et le 9e commandement du Décalogue.","Among the reminders that besieged him in his solitude, that of this reciprocal attachment dominated the others. All the yeast of bewilderment that a brain overexcited by neurosis can possess fermented, and, in thus delighting in these memories, in this morose delight, as theology calls this recurrence of old reproaches, it mingled with the physical visions of ardor spiritual nutcases by the ancient reading of the casuists, of the Busembaum and the Diana, of the Liguori and the Sanchez, dealing with the sins against the 6th and 9th commandments of the Decalogue.","Among the memories that visited him in his solitude, the recollection of this mutual attachment dominated all the rest. All the leaven of insanity that a brain over-stimulated by neurosis can contain was fermenting within him; and in his pleasurable contemplation of these memories, in his morose delectation, as the theologians call this recurrence of past iniquities, he added to the physical visions spiritual lusts kindled by his former readings of what such casuists as Busenbaum and Diana, Liguori and Sanchez had to say about sins against the sixth and ninth commandments.","In the ferment of his disordered brain, he delighted in mingling with these recollections of his past, other more gloomy pleasures, as theology qualifies the evocation of past, disgraceful acts. With the physical visions he mingled spiritual ardors brought into play and motivated by his old readings of the casuists, of the Busembaums and the Dianas, of the Liguoris and the Sanchezes, treating of transgressions against the sixth and ninth commandments of the Decalogue."
"Bercé par l'admirable prose de Flaubert, il écoutait, pantelant, le terrible duo et des frissons le parcoururent, de la nuque aux pieds, quand la Chimère proféra la solennelle et magique phrase:","Lulled by the admirable prose of Flaubert, he listened, panting, to the terrible duet and shivers ran through him, from the nape of the neck to the feet, when the Chimera uttered the solemn and magical phrase:","Spellbound by Flaubert’s wonderful prose, he listened in breathless awe to the terrifying duet, shuddering from head to foot when the Chimera pronounced the solemn and magical sentence:","Lulled by the admirable prose of Flaubert, he listened; he panted and shivering sensations raced through his frame, when the Chimera uttered the magical and solemn phrase:"
"Il demanda un verre d'amontillado, mais alors devant ce vin sec et pâle, les lénitives histoires, les douces malvacées de l'auteur anglais se défeuillèrent et les impitoyables révulsifs, les douloureux rubéfiants d'Edgar Poe, surgirent; le froid cauchemar de la barrique d'amontillado, de l'homme muré dans un souterrain, l'assaillit, les faces bénévoles et communes des buveurs américains et anglais qui occupaient la salle, lui parurent refléter d'involontaires et d'atroces pensées, d'instinctifs et d'odieux desseins, puis il s'aperçut qu'il s'esseulait, que l'heure du dîner était proche; il paya, s'arracha de sa chaise, et gagna, tout étourdi, la porte. Il reçut un soufflet mouillé dès qu'il mit les pieds dehors; inondés par la pluie et par les rafales, les réverbères agitaient leurs petits éventails de flamme, sans éclairer; encore descendu de plusieurs crans, le ciel s'était abaissé jusqu'au ventre des maisons. Des Esseintes considéra les arcades de la rue de Rivoli, noyées dans l'ombre et submergées par l'eau, et il lui sembla qu'il se tenait dans le morne tunnel creusé sous la Tamise; des tiraillements d'estomac le rappelèrent à la réalité; il rejoignit sa voiture, jeta au cocher l'adresse de la taverne de la rue d'Amsterdam, près de la gare, et il consulta sa montre: sept heures. Il avait juste le temps de dîner; le train ne partait qu'à huit heures cinquante minutes, et il comptait sur ses doigts, supputait les heures de la traversée de Dieppe à Newhaven, se disant: - Si les chiffres de l'indicateur sont exacts, je serai demain, sur le coup de midi et demi, à Londres.","He asked for a glass of amontillado, but then before this dry and pale wine, the soothing stories, the sweet malvaces of the English author shed their leaves and the pitiless revulsives, the painful reddenings of Edgar Poe, surged forth; the cold nightmare of the barrel of amontillado, of the man walled in an underground passage, assailed him, the benevolent and common faces of the American and English drinkers who occupied the room, seemed to him to reflect involuntary and atrocious thoughts, instinctive and odious designs, then he realized that he was lonely, that dinner time was approaching; he paid, tore himself from his chair, and made for the door, dazed. He received a wet slap as soon as he set foot outside; flooded by rain and squalls, the streetlamps shook their little fans of flame without giving any light; Still lowered several notches, the sky had lowered to the bellies of the houses. Des Esseintes gazed at the arcades of the Rue de Rivoli, shrouded in shadow and submerged in water, and it seemed to him that he was standing in the gloomy tunnel dug under the Thames; pangs of stomach brought him back to reality; he went back to his car, told the driver the address of the tavern in the rue d'Amsterdam, near the station, and he looked at his watch: seven o'clock. He had just time for dinner; the train did not leave until eight fifty minutes, and he counted on his fingers, calculating the times of the crossing from Dieppe to Newhaven, saying to himself: - If the figures on the indicator are correct, I will be on the train tomorrow. half past twelve in London.","He asked for a glass of Amontillado, but at the sight of this pale dry wine, the English author’s soothing stories and gentle lenitives gave place to the harsh revulsives and painful irritants provided by Edgar Allan Poe. The spine-chilling nightmare of the cask of Amontillado,4 the story of the man walled up in an underground chamber, took hold of his imagination; and behind the kind, ordinary faces of the American and English customers in the Bodega he fancied he could detect foul, uncontrollable desires, dark and odious schemes. But then he suddenly noticed that the place was emptying and that it was almost time for dinner; he paid his bill, got slowly to his feet and in a slight daze made for the door. The moment he set foot outside, he got a wet slap in the face from the weather. Swamped by the driving rain, the street lamps flickered feebly instead of shedding a steady light, while the sky seemed to have been taken down a few pegs, so that the clouds now hung below roof level. Des Esseintes looked along the arcades of the Rue de Rivoli, bathed in shadow and moisture, and imagined that he was standing in the dismal tunnel beneath the Thames. But sharp pangs of hunger recalled him to reality, and going back to the cab, he gave the driver the address of the tavern in the Rue d’Amsterdam, by the Gare Saint-Lazare. It was now seven o’clock by his watch: he had just time enough to dine before catching his train, which was due to leave at eight-fifty. He worked out how long the crossing from Dieppe to Newhaven would take, added up the hours on his fingers and finally told himself: ‘If the times given in the guide are correct, I shall arrive in London dead on twelve-thirty tomorrow afternoon.’","He called for a glass of amontillado, and suddenly, beside this pale, dry wine, the lenitive, sweetish stories of the English author were routed, to be replaced by the pitiless revulsives and the grievous irritants of Edgar Allen Poe; the cold nightmares of The Cask of Amontillado, of the man immured in a vault, assailed him; the ordinary placid faces of American and English drinkers who occupied the room, appeared to him to reflect involuntary frightful thoughts, to be harboring instinctive, odious plots. Then he perceived that he was left alone here and that the dinner hour was near. He payed his bill, tore himself from his seat and dizzily gained the door. He received a wet slap in the face upon leaving the place. The street lamps moved their tiny fans of flame which failed to illuminate; the sky had dropped to the very houses. Des Esseintes viewed the arcades of the rue de Rivoli, drowned in the gloom and submerged by water, and it seemed to him that he was in the gloomy tunnel under the Thames. Twitchings of his stomach recalled him to reality. He regained his carriage, gave the driver the address of the tavern in the rue d'Amsterdam near the station, and looked at his watch: seven o'clock. He had just time to eat dinner; the train would not leave until ten minutes of nine, and he counted on his fingers, reckoning the hours of travel from Dieppe to Newhaven, saying to himself: “If the figures of the timetable are correct, I shall be at London tomorrow at twelve-thirty.”"
"Dans Le Prêtre marié, les louanges du Christ dont les tentations avaient réussi, étaient chantées par Barbey d'Aurevilly; dans Les Diaboliques, l'auteur avait cédé au Diable qu'il célébrait, et alors apparaissait le sadisme, ce bâtard du catholicisme, que cette religion a, sous toutes ses formes, poursuivi de ses exorcismes et de ses bûchers, pendant des siècles.","In The Priest Married, the praises of Christ whose temptations had succeeded, were sung by Barbey d'Aurevilly; in Les Diaboliques, the author had yielded to the Devil he celebrated, and then sadism appeared, that bastard of Catholicism, which this religion has, in all its forms, pursued with its exorcisms and its stakes, for centuries.","In Un Prêtre marié, it was Christ whose temptations had been successful and whose praises were sung by Barbey d’Aurevilly; but in Les Diaboliques, the author had surrendered to the Devil, and it was Satan he extolled. At this point there appeared on the scene that bastard child of Catholicism which for centuries the Church has pursued with its exorcisms and its autos-da-fé – sadism.","In the Prêtre marié, Barbey d'Aurevilly sang the praises of Christ, who had prevailed against temptations; in the Diaboliques, the author succumbed to the Devil, whom he celebrated; then appeared sadism, that bastard of Catholicism, which through the centuries religion has relentlessly pursued with its exorcisms and stakes."
"En prose, la langue verbeuse, les métaphores redondantes, les digressions amphigouriques du Pois Chiche, ne le ravissaient pas davantage; la jactance de ses apostrophes, le flux de ses rengaines patriotiques, l'emphase de ses harangues, la pesante masse de son style, charnu, nourri, mais tourné à la graisse et privé de moelles et d'os, les insupportables scories de ses longs adverbes ouvrant la phrase, les inaltérables formules de ses adipeuses périodes mal liées entre elles par le fil des conjonctions, enfin ses lassantes habitudes de tautologie, ne le séduisaient guère; et, pas beaucoup plus que Cicéron, César, réputé pour son laconisme, ne l'enthousiasmait; car l'excès contraire se montrait alors, une aridité de pète sec, une stérilité de memento, une constipation incroyable et indue.","In prose, the verbose language, the redundant metaphors, the amphigouric digressions of Le Pois Chiche, did not delight him any more; the boastfulness of his apostrophes, the flow of his patriotic refrains, the emphasis of his harangues, the heavy mass of his style, fleshy, nourished, but turned to grease and deprived of marrow and bone, the unbearable dross of his long adverbs opening the sentence, the unalterable formulas of its fatty periods badly linked together by the thread of conjunctions, finally its weary habits of tautology, hardly seduced him; and, not much more than Cicero, Caesar, renowned for his laconicism, did not enthuse him; for the opposite excess then showed itself, an aridity of dryness, a sterility of memory, an incredible and undue constipation.","In prose, he was no more enamoured of the long-winded style, the redundant metaphors and the rambling digressions of old Chick-Pea,2 the bombast of his apostrophes, the wordiness of his patriotic perorations, the pomposity of his harangues, the heaviness of his style, well fed and well covered, but weak-boned and running to fat, the intolerable insignificance of his long introductory adverbs, the monotonous uniformity of his adipose periods clumsily tied together with conjunctions, and finally his wearisome predilection for tautology, all signally failed to endear him to Des Esseintes. Nor was Caesar, with his reputation for laconism, any more to his taste than Cicero; for he went to the other extreme, and offended by his pop-gun pithiness, his jotting-pad brevity, his unforgivable, unbelievable constipation.","Neither was he pleased, in prose, with the verbosities, the redundant metaphors, the ludicrous digressions of Cicero. There was nothing to beguile him in the boasting of his apostrophes, in the flow of his patriotic nonsense, in the emphasis of his harangues, in the ponderousness of his style, fleshy but ropy and lacking in marrow and bone, in the insupportable dross of his long adverbs with which he introduces phrases, in the unalterable formula of his adipose periods badly sewed together with the thread of conjunctions and, finally, in his wearisome habits of tautology. Nor was his enthusiasm wakened for Cæsar, celebrated for his laconic style. Here, on the contrary, was disclosed a surprising aridity, a sterility of recollection, an incredibly undue constipation."
"Alors il s'aperçut qu'un nom restait encore sur sa liste, le Cattleya de la Nouvelle-Grenade; on lui désigna une clochette ailée d'un lilas effacé, d'un mauve presque éteint; il s'approcha, mit son nez dessus et recula brusquement; elle exhalait une odeur de sapin verni, de boîte à jouets, évoquait les horreurs d'un jour de l'an.","Then he noticed that one name still remained on his list, the Cattleya of New Granada; they pointed out to him a winged bell of a faded lilac, an almost extinct mauve; he approached, put his nose to it and abruptly recoiled; it exhaled the smell of varnished fir, of toy boxes, evoking the horrors of a New Year's Day.","Then he noticed that there was still one name left on his list, the Cattleya of New Granada. They pointed out to him a little winged bell-flower of a pale lilac, an almost imperceptible mauve; he went up, put his nose to it and started back – for it gave out a smell of varnished deal, a toy-box smell that brought back horrid memories of New Year’s Day when he was a child.","Then he perceived that one name still remained on his list. It was the Cattleya of New Granada. On it was designed a little winged bell of a faded lilac, an almost dead mauve. He approached, placed his nose above the plant and quickly recoiled.

"Combien de soirs, sous la lampe éclairant de ses lueurs baissées la silencieuse chambre, ne s'était-il point senti effleuré par cette Hérodiade qui, dans l'oeuvre de Gustave Moreau maintenant envahie par l'ombre, s'effaçait plus légère, ne laissant plus entrevoir qu'une confuse statue, encore blanche, dans un brasier éteint de pierres!","How many evenings, under the lamp illuminating the silent room with its dim light, had he not felt touched by this Herodiade which, in the work of Gustave Moreau now invaded by shadow, faded more lightly, only allowing a glimpse of a confused statue, still white, in an extinguished brazier of stones!","Often of an evening, sitting in the dim light his lamp shed over the silent room, he had imagined he felt her brush past him – that same Herodias who in Gustave Moreau ’s picture had withdrawn into the advancing shadows, so that nothing could be seen but the vague shape of a white statue in the midst of a feebly glowing brazier of jewels.","How often, beneath the lamp that threw a low light on the silent chamber, had he not felt himself haunted by this Hérodiade who, in the work of Gustave Moreau, was now plunged in gloom revealing but a dim white statue in a brazier extinguished by stones."
"Ce presse-papier remua, en lui, tout un essaim de réminiscences.

Puis, il sortit du Musée et, sans quitter la ville, flâna en chemin, vagabonda par la rue du Sommerard et le boulevard Saint-Michel, s'embrancha dans les rues avoisinantes et s'arrêta devant certaines boutiques dont la fréquence et dont la tenue toute spéciale l'avaient maintes fois frappé.","This paperweight stirred within him a whole swarm of reminiscences.

Then, still in memory, he left the Museum and went for a stroll through the city streets, wandering along the Rue de Sommerard and the Boulevard Saint-Michel, turning off into the adjoining streets and stopping outside certain establishments whose multiplicity and peculiar appearance had often struck him.","This paper weight evoked many reminiscences within him. Aroused and actuated by the appearance of this trinket, his thoughts rushed from Fontenay to Paris, to the curio shop where he had purchased it, then returned to the Museum, and he mentally beheld the ivory astrolabe, while his unseeing eyes continued to gaze upon the copper astrolabe on the table. Then he left the Museum and, without quitting the town, strolled down the streets, wandered through the rue du Sommerard and the boulevard Saint-Michel, branched off into the neighboring streets, and paused before certain shops whose quite extraordinary appearance and profusion had often attracted him."
"À l'exception de ces poètes et de Stéphane Mallarmé qu'il enjoignit à son domestique de mettre de côté, pour le classer à part, des Esseintes n'était que bien faiblement attiré par les poètes.","With the exception of these poets and Stéphane Mallarmé, whom he told his servant to put aside and classify him separately, des Esseintes was only weakly attracted to poets.","With the exception of these authors and of Stéphane Mallarmé,12 whom he instructed his man to put on one side, to be set in a class apart, Des Esseintes was only very moderately drawn to the poets.","With the exception of the works of these poets and of Stéphane Mallarmé, which his servant was told to place to one side so that he might classify them separately, Des Esseintes was but slightly attracted towards the poets."
"D'autres poètes l'incitaient encore à se confier à eux: Tristan Corbière, qui, en 1873, dans l'indifférence générale, avait lancé un volume des plus excentriques, intitulé: Les Amours jaunes. Des Esseintes qui, en haine du banal et du commun, eût accepté les folies les plus appuyées, les extravagances les plus baroques, vivait de légères heures avec ce livre où le cocasse se mêlait à une énergie désordonnée, où des vers déconcertants éclataient dans des poèmes d'une parfaite obscurité, telles que les litanies du Sommeil, qu'il qualifiait, à un certain moment, d'","Other poets still encouraged him to confide in them: Tristan Corbière, who, in 1873, to general indifference, had launched a most eccentric volume, entitled: Les Amours jaunes. Des Esseintes who, in hatred of the banal and the commonplace, would have accepted the most emphatic follies, the most baroque extravagances, spent light hours with this book where the comical mingled with a disorderly energy, where disconcerting verses burst into poems of perfect obscurity, such as the litanies of Sleep, which he described, at a certain moment, as","There were other poets, too, who could still excite his interest and admiration. One of these was Tristan Corbière,8 who in 1873, amid general indifference, had published a fantastically eccentric book of verse entitled Les Amours jaunes. Des Esseintes, who, in his hatred of all that was trite and vulgar, would have welcomed the most outrageous follies, the most bizarre extravagances, spent many happy hours with this book in which droll humour was combined with turbulent energy, and in which lines of disconcerting brilliance occurred in poems of wonderful obscurity. There were the litanies in his Sommeil, for instance, where he described sleep at one point as the","There were other poets, too, who induced him to confide himself to them: Tristan Corbière who, in 1873, in the midst of the general apathy had issued a most eccentric volume entitled: Les Amours jaunes. Des Esseintes who, in his hatred of the banal and commonplace, would gladly have accepted the most affected folly and the most singular extravagance, spent many enjoyable hours with this work where drollery mingled with a disordered energy, and where disconcerting lines blazed out of poems so absolutely obscure as the litanies of Sommeil, that they qualified their author for the name of"
"Enfermé, de même que tous ses confrères, dans le cercle étroit des spéculations orthodoxes, obligé, ainsi qu'eux, de piétiner sur place et de ne toucher qu'aux idées émises et consacrées par les Pères de l'église et développées par les maîtres de la chaire, il parvenait à donner le change, à les rajeunir, presque à les modifier, par une forme plus personnelle et plus vive. çà et là, dans ses Conférences de Notre-Dame, des trouvailles d'expressions, des audaces de mots, des accents d'amour, des bondissements, des cris d'allégresse, des effusions éperdues qui faisaient fumer le style séculaire sous sa plume. Puis, en sus de l'orateur de talent, qu'était cet habile et doux moine dont les adresses et dont les efforts s'étaient épuisés dans l'impossible tâche de concilier les doctrines libérales d'une société avec les dogmes autoritaires de l'église, il y avait en lui un tempérament de fervente dilection, de diplomatique tendresse. Alors, dans les lettres qu'il écrivait à des jeunes gens, passaient des caresses de père exhortant ses fils, de souriantes réprimandes, de bienveillants conseils, d'indulgents pardons. D'aucunes étaient charmantes, où il avouait toute sa gourmandise d'affection, et d'autres étaient presque imposantes lorsqu'il soutenait le courage et dissipait les doutes, par les inébranlables certitudes de sa Foi. En somme, ce sentiment de paternité qui prenait sous sa plume quelque chose de délicat et de féminin imprimait à sa prose un accent unique parmi toute la littérature cléricale.","Locked up, like all his colleagues, in the narrow circle of orthodox speculations, forced, like them, to trample on the spot and to touch only the ideas emitted and consecrated by the Fathers of the Church and developed by the masters of the pulpit, he managed to deceive them, to rejuvenate them, almost to modify them, by a more personal and more lively form. here and there, in his Conférences de Notre-Dame, finds of expression, audacity of words, accents of love, leaps, cries of joy, distraught effusions which made the secular style smoke under his pen . Then, in addition to the talented orator, who was that skilful and gentle monk whose skills and whose efforts had been exhausted in the impossible task of reconciling the liberal doctrines of a society with the authoritarian dogmas of the Church, there was in him a temperament of fervent love, of diplomatic tenderness. So, in the letters he wrote to young people, passed the caresses of a father exhorting his sons, smiling reprimands, benevolent advice, indulgent pardons. Some were charming, where he confessed all his gluttony of affection, and others were almost imposing when he supported courage and dispelled doubts, by the unshakable certainties of his Faith. In short, this feeling of paternity which took on something delicate and feminine from his pen imprinted on his prose an accent unique among all clerical literature.","Confined, like all his colleagues, within the narrow circle of orthodox speculation; obliged, as they were, to mark time and to consider only such ideas as had been conceived and consecrated by the Fathers of the Church and developed by the great preachers, he none the less managed to pull a bluff, to rejuvenate and almost modify these same ideas, simply by giving them a more personal and lively form. Here and there in his Conférences de Notre-Dame, happy phrases, startling expressions, accents of love, bursts of passion, cries of joy and demonstrations of delight occurred that made the time-honoured style sizzle and smoke under his pen. And then, over and above his oratorical gifts, this brilliant, gentle-hearted monk who had used up all his skill and all his energy in a hopeless attempt to reconcile the liberal doctrines of a modern society with the authoritarian dogmas of the Church, was also endowed with a capacity for fervent affection, for discreet tenderness. Accordingly, the letters he wrote to young men used to contain fond paternal exhortations, smiling reprimands, kindly words of advice, indulgent words of forgiveness. Some of these letters were charming, as when he admitted his greed for love, and others were quite impressive, as when he sustained his correspondents’ courage and dissipated their doubts by stating the unshakeable certitude of his own beliefs. In short, this feeling of fatherhood, which under his pen acquired a dainty feminine quality, lent his prose an accent unique in clerical literature.","Immured, like his colleagues, in the narrow circle of orthodox speculations, likewise obliged to dissipate his energies in the exclusive consideration of those theories which had been expressed and consecrated by the Fathers of the Church and developed by the masters of the pulpit, he succeeded in inbuing them with novelty and in rejuvenating, almost in modifying them, by clothing them in a more personal and stimulating form. Here and there in his Conférences de Notre-Dame, were treasures of expression, audacious usages of words, accents of love, rapid movements, cries of joy and distracted effusions. Then, to his position as a brilliant and gentle monk whose ingenuity and labors had been exhausted in the impossible task of conciliating the liberal doctrines of society with the authoritarian dogmas of the Church, he added a temperament of fierce love and suave diplomatic tenderness. In his letters to young men may be found the caressing inflections of a father exhorting his sons with smiling reprimands, the well-meaning advice and the indulgent forgiveness. Some of these Des Esseintes found charming, confessing as they did the monk's yearning for affection, while others were even imposing when they sought to sustain courage and dissipate doubts by the inimitable certainties of Faith. In fine, this sentiment of paternity, which gave his pen a delicately feminine quality, lent to his prose a characteristically individual accent discernible among all the clerical literature."
"La Justice trouvait toutes naturelles les fraudes en matière de génération; c'était un fait, reconnu, admis il n'était point de ménage, si riche qu'il fût, qui ne confiât ses enfants à la lessive ou qui n'usât d'artifices qu'on vendait librement et qu'il ne serait d'ailleurs venu à l'esprit de personne, de réprouver. Et pourtant, si ces réserves ou si ces subterfuges demeuraient insuffisants, si la fraude ratait et, qu'afin de la réparer, l'on recourût à des mesures plus efficaces, ah! alors, il n'y avait pas assez de prisons, pas assez de maisons centrales, pas assez de bagnes, pour enfermer les gens que condamnaient, de bonne foi, du reste, d'autres individus qui, le soir même, dans le lit conjugal, trichaient de leur mieux pour ne pas enfanter des mômes!","Justice found all frauds in matters of generation quite natural; it was a fact, recognized, admitted there was no household, however rich it was, which did not entrust its children to the laundry or which did not use artifices which were freely sold and which it did not would, moreover, have occurred to anyone to reprove. And yet, if these reserves or if these subterfuges remained insufficient, if the fraud failed and, in order to repair it, one had recourse to more effective measures, ah! so there were not enough prisons, not enough central prisons, not enough penal colonies, to lock up the people who were condemned, in good faith, moreover, by other individuals who, that very evening, in bed marriage, cheated as best they could so as not to give birth to kids!","Justice regarded as perfectly legitimate the tricks that were used to prevent conception; it was a recognized, acknowledged fact; there was never a couple in the land, no matter how well-to-do , that did not send its children to the wash or use devices that could be bought openly in the shops – devices nobody would ever dream of condemning. And yet, if these natural or mechanical subterfuges proved ineffectual, if the trickery failed and if to make good the failure recourse was had to more reliable methods, why then there were not prisons, jails or penitentiaries enough to accommodate the people convicted out of hand, and in all good faith, by other individuals who the same night, in the conjugal bed, used every trick they knew to avoid begetting brats of their own.","In the matter of generation, Justice finds the agencies for deception to be quite natural. It is a recognized and acknowledged fact. There is scarcely a home of any station that does not confide its children to the drain pipes, or that does not employ contrivances that are freely sold, and which it would enter no person's mind to prohibit. And yet, if these subterfuges proved insufficient, if the attempt miscarried and if, to remedy matters, one had recourse to more efficacious measures, ah! then there were not prisons enough, not municipal jails enough to confine those who, in good faith, were condemned by other individuals who had that very evening, on the conjugal bed, done their utmost to avoid giving birth to children."
"Et plus des Esseintes relisait Baudelaire, plus il reconnaissait un indicible charme à cet écrivain qui, dans un temps où le vers ne servait plus qu'à peindre l'aspect extérieur des êtres et des choses, était parvenu à exprimer l'inexprimable, grâce à une langue musculeuse et charnue, qui, plus que toute autre, possédait cette merveilleuse puissance de fixer avec une étrange santé d'expressions, les états morbides les plus fuyants, les plus tremblés, des esprits épuisés et des âmes tristes.","And the more des Esseintes reread Baudelaire, the more he recognized an indescribable charm in this writer who, at a time when verse no longer served anything but to paint the external appearance of beings and things, had succeeded in expressing the inexpressible, thanks to a muscular and fleshy tongue, which, more than any other, possessed this marvelous power of fixing, with a strange health of expression, the most fleeting, most trembling morbid states of exhausted minds and sad souls.","The more Des Esseintes reread his Baudelaire, the more he appreciated the indescribable charm of this writer who, at a time when verse no longer served any purpose except to depict the external appearance of creatures and things, had succeeded in expressing the inexpressible – thanks to a solid, sinewy style which, more than any other, possessed that remarkable quality, the power to define in curiously healthy terms the most fugitive and ephemeral of the unhealthy conditions of weary spirits and melancholy souls.","And the more Des Esseintes read Baudelaire, the more he felt the ineffable charm of this writer who, in an age when verse served only to portray the external semblance of beings and things, had succeeded in expressing the inexpressible in a muscular and brawny language; who, more than any other writer possessed a marvelous power to define with a strange robustness of expression, the most fugitive and tentative morbidities of exhausted minds and sad souls."
"Volontiers, des Esseintes l'avait accompagné dans ses oeuvres les plus diverses. Après ses _Romances sans paroles_ parues dans l'imprimerie d'un journal à Sens, Verlaine s'était assez longuement tu, puis en des vers charmants où passait l'accent doux et transi de Villon, il avait reparu, chantant la Vierge, ""loin de nos jours d'esprit charnel, et de chair triste"". Des Esseintes relisait souvent ce livre de _Sagesse_ et se suggérait devant ses poèmes des rêveries clandestines, des fictions d'un amour occulte pour une Madone byzantine qui se muait, à un certain moment, en une Cydalise égarée dans notre siècle, et si mystérieuse et si troublante, qu'on ne pouvait savoir si elle aspirait à des dépravations tellement monstrueuses qu'elles deviendraient, aussitôt accomplies, irrésistibles; ou bien, si elle s'élançait, elle-même, dans le rêve, dans un rêve immaculé, où l'adoration de l'âme flotterait autour d'elle, à l'état continuellement inavoué, continuellement pur.","Willingly, des Esseintes had accompanied him in his most diverse works. After his _Romances sans mots_ which appeared in the printing press of a newspaper in Sens, Verlaine had been silent for quite a long time, then in charming verses through which Villon's soft and chilled accent passed, he had reappeared, singing the Virgin, "" far from our days of carnal spirit, and sad flesh"". Des Esseintes often reread this book of _Sagesse_ and suggested to himself in front of his poems clandestine reveries, fictions of an occult love for a Byzantine Madonna who was transformed, at a certain moment, into a Cydalise lost in our century, and so mysterious and so disturbing, that one could not know if she aspired to depravities so monstrous that they would become, as soon as they were accomplished, irresistible; or else, if she herself rushed into the dream, into an immaculate dream, where the adoration of the soul would float around her, in a state continually unacknowledged, continually pure.","Des Esseintes had gladly followed him through all his varied works. After the publication of his Romances sans paroles, distributed by the printing-office of a newspaper at Sens, Verlaine had written nothing for quite a time; then, in charming verses that echoed the gentle, naive accents of Villon, he had reappeared, singing the Virgin’s praises, ‘far from our days of carnal spirit and weary flesh’. Often Des Esseintes would reread this book, Sagesse, allowing the poems it contained to inspire in him secret reveries, impossible dreams of an occult passion for a Byzantine Madonna able to change at a given moment into a Cydalisa who had strayed by accident into the nineteenth century; she was so mysterious and so alluring that it was impossible to tell whether she was longing to indulge in depravities so monstrous that, once accomplished they would become irresistible, or whether she herself was soaring heavenwards in an immaculate dream, in which the adoration of the soul would float about her in a love for ever unconfessed, for ever pure.","Des Esseintes had followed him with delight in his most diversified works. After his Romances sans paroles which had appeared in a journal, Verlaine had preserved a long silence, reappearing later in those charming verses, hauntingly suggestive of the gentle and cold accents of Villon, singing of the Virgin, “removed from our days of carnal thought and weary flesh.” Des Esseintes often re-read Sagesse whose poems provoked him to secret reveries, a fanciful love for a Byzantine Madonna who, at a certain moment, changed into a distracted modern Cydalise so mysterious and troubling that one could not know whether she aspired toward depravities so monstrous that they became irresistible, or whether she moved in an immaculate dream where the adoration of the soul floated around her ever unavowed and ever pure."
"Il pouvait apercevoir enfin des cannes à pêche, des filets brunis au tan, des rouleaux de voiles rousses, une ancre minuscule en liège, peinte en noir, jetés en tas, près de la porte qui communiquait avec la cuisine par un couloir garni de capitons et résorbait, de même que le corridor rejoignant la salle à manger au cabinet de travail, toutes les odeurs et tous les bruits.","At last he could see fishing rods, tan-brown nets, rolls of russet sails, a tiny cork anchor, painted black, thrown in a heap near the door which communicated with the kitchen by a corridor lined with quilting. and absorbed, like the corridor joining the dining room to the study, all the smells and all the noises.","Finally he could take stock of the fishing-rods, the brown-tanned nets, the rolls of russet-coloured sails and the miniature anchor made of cork painted black, all piled higgledy-piggledy beside the door that led to the kitchen by way of a corridor padded, like the passage between dining-room and study, in such a way as to absorb any noises and smells.","Or, he could look at fishing rods, tan-colored nets, rolls of russet sail, a tiny, black-painted cork anchor—all thrown in a heap near the door communicating with the kitchen by a passage furnished with cappadine silk which reabsorbed, just as in the corridor which connected the dining room with his study, every odor and sound."
"à cet étrange alliage s'ajoutaient l'amour des douceurs béates, des traductions du livre des Visions d'Angèle de Foligno, un livre d'une sottise fluide sans égale, et des oeuvres choisies de Jean Rusbrock l'Admirable, un mystique du XIIIe siècle, dont la prose offrait un incompréhensible mais attirant amalgame d'exaltations ténébreuses, d'effusions caressantes, de transports âpres.","to this strange alloy were added the love of blissful sweetness, translations of the book of Visions by Angèle de Foligno, a book of unequaled fluid stupidity, and selected works by Jean Rusbrock the Admirable, a mystic of the 13th century, whose prose offered an incomprehensible but attractive amalgam of dark exaltations, caressing effusions, harsh transports.","To this strange mixture was added a love of sugary piety revealed in translations of the Visions of Angela da Foligno, a book of unparalleled stupidity and fluidity, and selections from Jan van Ruysbroeck, a thirteenth-century mystic whose prose presented an incomprehensible but attractive amalgam of gloomy ecstasies, tender raptures and violent rages.","To this strange mixture was added the love of sanctimonious delights, such as a translation of the Visions by Angèle de Foligno, a book of an unparalleled fluid stupidity, with selected works of Jean Rusbrock l'Admirable, a mystic of the thirteenth century whose prose offered an incomprehensible but alluring combination of dusky exaltations, caressing effusions, and poignant transports."
"Alors les pas du cheval s'arrêtèrent. Il était là, derrière une lucarne ronde, dans le couloir; plus mort que vif, des Esseintes se retourna, vit par l'oeil-de-boeuf des oreilles droites, des dents jaunes, des naseaux soufflant deux jets de vapeur qui puaient le phénol.","Then the steps of the horse stopped. He was there, behind a round skylight, in the corridor; More dead than alive, Des Esseintes turned round, saw through the bull's-eye straight ears, yellow teeth, nostrils blowing out two jets of steam that reeked of phenol.","Just then the sound of the horse’s hoofs stopped. It was there in the passage, behind a little round window; more dead than alive, Des Esseintes turned round and saw through the circular opening two pricked ears, a set of yellow teeth, a pair of nostrils breathing twin jets of vapour that stank of phenol.","Then the hoof beats paused. He was in the passage, behind a round skylight. More dead than alive, Des Esseintes turned about and through the round window beheld projecting erect ears, yellow teeth, nostrils from which breathed two jets of vapor smelling of phenol."
"Chez les uns, c'est un retour aux âges consommés, aux civilisations disparues, aux temps morts; chez les autres, c'est un élancement vers le fantastique et vers le rêve, c'est une vision plus ou moins intense d'un temps à éclore dont l'image reproduit, sans qu'il le sache, par un effet d'atavisme, celle des époques révolues.","For some, it is a return to consummated ages, to vanished civilizations, to dead times; in the others, it is a thrust towards the fantastic and towards the dream, it is a more or less intense vision of a time to hatch whose image reproduces, without his knowing it, by an effect of atavism, that of bygone eras.","In some cases there is a return to past ages, to vanished civilizations, to dead centuries; in others there is a pursuit of dream and fantasy, a more or less vivid vision of a future whose image reproduces, unconsciously and as a result of atavism, that of past epochs.","With some, it is a return to vanished ages, to extinct civilizations, to dead epochs; with others, it is an urge towards a fantastic future, to a more or less intense vision of a period about to dawn, whose image, by an effect of atavism of which he is unaware, is a reproduction of some past age."
"Quant au village même, il le connaissait à peine. Par sa fenêtre, une nuit, il avait contemplé le silencieux paysage qui se développe, en descendant, jusqu'au pied d'un coteau, sur le sommet duquel se dressent les batteries du bois de Verrières.","As for the village itself, he hardly knew it. Through his window, one night, he had contemplated the silent landscape which unfolds, descending, to the foot of a hill, on the summit of which stand the batteries of the Bois de Verrieres.","As for the village itself, he had scarcely seen it. Only once, looking out of his window one night, had he examined the silent landscape stretching down to the foot of a hill which is surmounted by the batteries of the Bois de Verrières.","As for the village itself, he hardly knew it. One night he had gazed through his window at the silent landscape which slowly unfolded, as it dipped to the foot of a slope, on whose summit the batteries of the Verrières woods were trained."
"Avec l'Albane, l'Aurore présentait les deux notes extrêmes du tempérament, l'apoplexie et la chlorose de cette plante.","With the Albane, the Aurore presented the two extreme notes of the temperament, the apoplexy and the chlorosis of this plant.","Between them, the Albane and Aurora Borealis represented the two temperamental extremes, apoplexy and chlorosis, in this particular family of plants.","The Albano and the Aurora sounded the two extreme notes of temperament, the apoplexy and chlorosis of this plant."
"Tout cela n'empêche pas, fit-il, arraché à ses réflexions, par une défaillance de tout son corps, qu'il va falloir me défier de ces délicieux et abominables exercices qui m'écrasent. Il soupira: - Allons, encore des plaisirs à modérer, des précautions à prendre; et il se réfugia dans son cabinet de travail, pensant échapper plus facilement ainsi à la hantise de ces parfums.","All that doesn't prevent, he said, torn from his thoughts by a weakness of his whole body, that I'm going to have to beware of these delicious and abominable exercises that crush me. He sighed: - Come on, more pleasures to moderate, precautions to take; and he took refuge in his study, thinking that he would more easily escape the obsession of these perfumes.","‘All that,’ he muttered, interrupted in his reflections by a sudden feeling of faintness, ‘doesn’t alter the fact that I shall have to beware of these delicious, atrocious experiments, which are just wearing me out.’ He heaved a sigh. ‘Ah, well, that means more pleasures to cut down on, more precautions to take!’ – and he shut himself up in his study, hoping that there he would find it easier to escape from the obsessive influence of all these perfumes.","“But all this does not prevent me from seeing,” he said, forced by weakness from his meditations, “that I must be careful to mistrust these delicious and abominable practices which may ruin my constitution.” He sighed. “Well, well, more pleasures to moderate, more precautions to be taken.” And he passed into his study, hoping the more easily to escape the spell of these perfumes."
"Un certain amollissement enveloppa des Esseintes dans cette atmosphère de corps de garde; étourdi par les bavardages des Anglais causant entre eux, il rêvassait, évoquant devant la pourpre des porto remplissant les verres, les créatures de Dickens qui aiment tant à les boire, peuplant imaginairement la cave de personnages nouveaux, voyant ici, les cheveux blancs et le teint enflammé de Monsieur Wickfield; là, la mine flegmatique et rusée et l'oeil implacable de Monsieur Tulkinghorn, le funèbre avoué de Bleak-house. Positivement, tous se détachaient de sa mémoire, s'installaient, dans la Bodéga, avec leurs faits et leurs gestes; ses souvenirs, ravivés par de récentes lectures, atteignaient une précision inouïe. La ville du romancier, la maison bien éclairée, bien chauffée, bien servie, bien close, les bouteilles lentement versées par la petite Dorrit, par Dora Copperfield, par la soeur de Tom Pinch, lui apparurent naviguant ainsi qu'une arche tiède, dans un déluge de fange et de suie. Il s'acagnarda dans ce Londres fictif, heureux d'être à l'abri, écoutant naviguer sur la Tamise les remorqueurs qui poussaient de sinistres hurlements, derrière les Tuileries, près du pont. Son verre était vide malgré la vapeur éparse dans cette cave encore échauffée par les fumigations des cigares et des pipes, il éprouvait, en retombant dans la réalité, par ce temps d'humidité fétide, un petit frisson.","A certain softening enveloped Des Esseintes in this atmosphere of the guardhouse; stunned by the chatter of the English talking among themselves, he was daydreaming, evoking in front of the purple of the ports filling the glasses, the creatures of Dickens who love to drink them so much, imaginatively populating the cellar with new characters, seeing here, the white hair and the inflamed complexion of Mr. Wickfield; there, the phlegmatic and shrewd countenance and the implacable eye of Mr. Tulkinghorn, the avowed funereal of Bleak-house. Positively, all of them detached themselves from his memory, settled down in the Bodega, with their doings and their gestures; his memories, revived by recent readings, reached an unprecedented precision. The town of the novelist, the well-lit, well-heated, well-served, well-closed house, the bottles slowly poured by little Dorrit, by Dora Copperfield, by Tom Pinch's sister, appeared to him sailing like a warm ark, in a deluge of mire and soot. He hunkered down in this fictitious London, happy to be sheltered, listening to the tugboats navigating on the Thames which uttered sinister howls, behind the Tuileries, near the bridge. His glass was empty despite the sparse steam in this cellar still heated by the fumigations of cigars and pipes, he felt, falling back into reality, in this fetidly humid weather, a little shiver.","And facing him was a sort of American naval officer, stout and stocky, swarthy and bottle-nosed, a cigar stuck in the hairy orifice of his mouth, and his eyes sleepily contemplating the framed champagne advertisements on the walls – the trademarks of Perrier and Roederer, Heidsieck and Mumm, and the hooded head of a monk identified in Gothic lettering as Dom Pérignon of Reims. Des Esseintes began to feel somewhat stupefied in this heavy guard-room atmosphere. His senses dulled by the monotonous chatter of these English people talking to one another, he drifted into a daydream, calling to mind some of Dickens’s characters, who were so partial to the rich red port he saw in glasses all about him, and peopling the cellar in fancy with a new set of customers – imagining here Mr Wickfield’s white hair and ruddy complexion, there the sharp, expressionless features and unfeeling eyes of Mr Tulkinghorn, the grim lawyer of Bleak House. These characters stepped right out of his memory to take their places in the Bodega, complete with all their mannerisms and gestures, for his recollections, revived by a recent reading of the novels, were astonishingly precise and detailed. The Londoner’s home as described by the novelist – well lighted, well heated and well appointed, with bottles being slowly emptied by Little Dorrit, Dora Copperfield or Tom Pinch ’s sister Ruth3 – appeared to him in the guise of a cosy ark sailing snugly through a deluge of soot and mire. He settled down comfortably in this London of the imagination, happy to be indoors, and believing for a moment that the dismal hootings of the tugs by the bridge behind the Tuileries were coming from boats on the Thames. But his glass was empty now; and despite the warm fug in the cellar and the added heat from the smoke of pipes and cigars, he shivered slightly as he came back to reality and the foul, dank weather.","A certain enervation enveloped Des Esseintes in this guard house atmosphere; stunned by the prattle of the Englishmen conversing among themselves, he fell into a revery, evoking, before the purple port which filled the glasses, the creatures of Dickens that love this drink so very much, imaginatively peopling the cellar with new personages, seeing here, the white head of hair and the ruddy complexion of Mr. Wickfield; there, the phlegmatic, crafty face and the vengeful eye of Mr. Tulkinghorn, the melancholy solicitor in Bleak House. Positively, all of them broke away from his memory and installed themselves in the Bodega, with their peculiar characteristics and their betraying gestures. His memories, brought to life by his recent readings, attained a startling precision. The city of the romancer, the house illumined and warmed, so perfectly tended and isolated, the bottles poured slowly by little Dorrit and Dora Copperfield and Tom Pinch's sister, appeared to him sailing like an ark in a deluge of mire and soot. Idly he wandered through this imaginary London, happy to be sheltered, as he listened to the sinister shrieks of tugs plying up and down the Thames. His glass was empty. Despite the heavy fumes in this cellar, caused by the cigars and pipes, he experienced a cold shiver when he returned to the reality of the damp and fetid weather."

"Ici, c'est l'inspecteur des garnis qui vient demander le nom des voyageurs récemment entrés; là, ce sont des lupanars où des gens rôdent autour de femmes nues, debout entre des écriteaux, tandis que par les portes mal fermées des chambres, l'on entrevoit les ébats des couples; là, encore, au travers des villas d'un luxe insolent, d'une démence de richesses et de faste, comme au travers des pauvres auberges qui se succèdent dans le livre, avec leurs lits de sangle défaits, pleins de punaises, la société du temps s'agite: impurs filous, tels qu'Ascylte et qu'Eumolpe, à la recherche d'une bonne aubaine; vieux incubes aux robes retroussées, aux joues plâtrées de blanc de plomb et de rouge acacia; gitons de seize ans, dodus et frisés; femmes en proie aux attaques de l'hystérie; coureurs d'héritages offrant leurs garçons et leurs filles aux débauches des testateurs; tous courent le long des pages, discutent dans les rues, s'attouchent dans les bains, se rouent de coups ainsi que dans une pantomime.","Here it is the inspector of garnis who comes to ask for the names of travelers who have recently entered; there, they are brothels where people prowl around naked women, standing between signs, while through the badly closed doors of the rooms, one glimpses the antics of couples; there, again, through the villas of insolent luxury, of an insanity of wealth and ostentation, as through the poor inns which follow one another in the book, with their unmade sling beds, full of bugs, society time is agitated: impure rogues, such as Ascyltus and Eumolpe, in search of a good windfall; old incubi with tucked-up robes, cheeks plastered with white lead and acacia red; sixteen-year-old plump, curly-haired kittens; women prey to attacks of hysteria; inheritance runners offering their sons and daughters to the debauchery of testators; they all run along the pages, chat in the streets, touch each other in the baths, beat each other up like in a pantomime.","Here we have the Inspector of Lodgings coming to ask for the names of any travellers who have recently arrived; there, a brothel where men circle round naked women standing beside placards giving their price, while through half-open doors couples can be seen disporting themselves in the bedrooms. Elsewhere, in villas full of insolent luxury where wealth and ostentation run riot, as also in the mean inns described throughout the book, with their unmade trestle beds swarming with fleas, the society of the day has its fling – depraved ruffians like Ascyltus and Eumolpus, out for what they can get; unnatural old men with their gowns tucked up and their cheeks plastered with white lead and acacia rouge; catamites of sixteen, plump and curly-headed; women having hysterics; legacy-hunters offering their boys and girls to gratify the lusts of rich testators, all these and more scurry across the pages of the Satyricon, squabbling in the streets, fingering one another in the baths, beating one another up like characters in a pantomime.","One glimpses the inspector of furnished lodgings who has inquired after the newly arrived travellers; bawdy houses where men prowl around nude women, while through the half-open doors of the rooms couples can be seen in dalliance; the society of the time, in villas of an insolent luxury, a revel of richness and magnificence, or in the poor quarters with their rumpled, bug-ridden folding-beds; impure sharpers, like Ascylte and Eumolpe in search of a rich windfall; old incubi with tucked-up dresses and plastered cheeks of white lead and red acacia; plump, curled, depraved little girls of sixteen; women who are the prey of hysterical attacks; hunters of heritages offering their sons and daughters to debauched testators. All pass across the pages. They debate in the streets, rub elbows in the baths, beat each other unmercifully as in a pantomime."
"Il régla aussi les heures immuables des repas; ils étaient d'ailleurs peu compliqués et très succincts, les défaillances de son estomac ne lui permettant plus d'absorber des mets variés ou lourds.","He also regulated the immutable hours of meals; they were, moreover, uncomplicated and very succinct, the failings of his stomach no longer allowing him to absorb varied or heavy foods.","He went on to fix his mealtimes according to an unvarying schedule; the meals themselves were necessarily plain and simple, for the feebleness of his stomach no longer allowed him to enjoy heavy or elaborate dishes.","The hours of eating were also regulated. His instructions in this regard were short and explicit, for the weakened state of his stomach no longer permitted him to absorb heavy or varied foods."
"En guise de table de nuit, il installa un antique prie-Dieu dont l'intérieur pouvait contenir un vase et dont l'extérieur supportait un eucologe; il apposa contre le mur, en face, un banc-d'oeuvre, surmonté d'un grand dais à jour garni de miséricordes sculptées en plein bois, et il pourvut ses flambeaux d'église de chandelles en vraie cire qu'il achetait dans une maison spéciale, réservée aux besoins du culte, car il professait un sincère éloignement pour les pétroles, pour les schistes, pour les gaz, pour les bougies en stéarine, pour tout l'éclairage moderne, si voyant et si brutal.","As a bedside table, he installed an antique prie-dieu, the interior of which could contain a vase and the exterior of which supported a eucologium; he affixed against the wall, opposite, a pew, surmounted by a large open canopy furnished with misericords carved in solid wood, and he provided his church torches with real wax candles which he bought in a special house, reserved for the needs of the cult, for he professed a sincere aversion to oil, to shale, to gas, to stearin candles, to all the modern lighting, so conspicuous and so brutal.","By way of a bedside table, he installed an antique priedieu, the inside of which could hold a chamber-pot while the top supported a euchologion; against the opposite wall he set a churchwardens’ pew, with a great openwork canopy and misericords carved in the solid wood; and to provide illumination, he had some altar candlesticks fitted with real wax tapers which he bought from a firm specializing in ecclesiastical requirements, for he professed a genuine antipathy to all modern forms of lighting, whether paraffin, shale-oil, stearin candles or gas, finding them all too crude and garish for his liking.","For his table, he installed an antique praying-desk the inside of which could contain an urn and the outside a prayer book. Against the wall, opposite it, he placed a church pew surmounted by a tall dais with little benches carved out of solid wood. His church tapers were made of real wax, procured from a special house which catered exclusively to houses of worship, for Des Esseintes professed a sincere repugnance to gas, oil and ordinary candles, to all modern forms of illumination, so gaudy and brutal."
"Cet art admirable l'avait longtemps séduit, mais il rêvait maintenant à la combinaison d'une autre flore.","This admirable art had long seduced him, but he now dreamed of combining another flora.","This admirable artistry had long enthralled him, but now he dreamt of collecting another kind of flora: tired of artificial flowers aping real ones, he wanted some natural flowers that would look like fakes.2","This wonderful art had held him entranced for a long while, but now he was dreaming of another experiment. He wished to go one step beyond."
"Le fiacre s'arrêta devant la taverne-, de nouveau, des Esseintes descendit et il pénétra dans une longue salle, sans dorure, brune, divisée par des cloisons à mi-corps, en une série de compartiments semblables aux boxs des écuries; dans cette salle, évasée près de la porte, d'abondantes pompes à bières se dressaient sur un comptoir, près de jambons aussi culottés que de vieux violons, de homards peints au minium, de maquereaux marinés, avec des ronds d'oignons et de carottes crus, des tranches de citron, des bouquets de laurier et de thym, des baies de genièvre et du gros poivre nageant dans une sauce trouble.","The cab stopped in front of the tavern. Des Esseintes got out again and entered a long room, ungilded, brown, divided by half-length partitions into a series of compartments similar to stable boxes; in this room, flared near the door, abundant pumps of beer stood on a counter, near hams as cheeky as old violins, lobsters painted with minium, marinated mackerels, with rings of onions and raw carrots, slices of lemon, sprigs of bay leaf and thyme, juniper berries and coarse pepper swimming in a cloudy sauce.","The cab came to a stop in front of the tavern. Once again Des Esseintes got out, and made his way into a long hall, decorated with brown paint instead of the usual gilt mouldings, and divided by means of breast-high partitions into a number of compartments, rather like the loose-boxes in a stable. In this narrow room, which broadened out near the door, a line of beer-pulls stood at attention along a counter spread with hams as brown as old violins, lobsters the colour of red lead, and salted mackerel, as well as slices of onion, raw carrot and lemon, bunches of bay-leaves and thyme, juniper berries and peppercorns swimming in a thick sauce.","The fiacre stopped in front of the tavern. Once more, Des Esseintes alighted and entered a long dark plain room, divided into partitions as high as a man's waist,—a series of compartments resembling stalls. In this room, wider towards the door, many beer pumps stood on a counter, near hams having the color of old violins, red lobsters, marinated mackerel, with onions and carrots, slices of lemon, bunches of laurel and thym, juniper berries and long peppers swimming in thick sauce."
"C'était le grand bagne de l'Amérique transporté sur notre continent; c'était enfin, l'immense, la profonde, l'inconmensurable goujaterie du financier et du parvenu, rayonnant, tel qu'un abject soleil, sur la ville idolâtre qui éjaculait, à plat ventre, d'impurs cantiques devant le tabernacle impie des banques!","It was the great prison of America transported to our continent; it was finally, the immense, the profound, the immeasurable boorishness of the financier and the upstart, radiating, like an abject sun, on the idolatrous city which ejaculated, flat on its stomach, impure hymns before the impious tabernacle. banks!","This was the vast bagnio of America transported to the continent of Europe; this was the limitless, unfathomable, immeasurable scurviness of the financier and the self-made man, beaming down like a shameful sun on the idolatrous city, which grovelled on its belly, chanting vile songs of praise before the impious tabernacle of the Bank. ‘Well, crumble then, society!","It was the great American hulks transported to our continent. It was the immense, the profound, the incommensurable peasantry of the financier and the parvenu, beaming, like a pitiful sun, upon the idolatrous town which wallowed on the ground the while it uttered impure psalms before the impious tabernacle of banks."
"Son attirance diminuait avec la fin de ces deux siècles; peu ravi, en somme, par la pesante masse des latinistes carlovingiens, les Alcuin et les Eginhard, il se contentait, comme spécimen de la langue au IXe siècle, des chroniques de l'anonyme de saint Gall, de Fréculfe et de Réginon, du poème sur le siège de Paris tissé par Abbo le Courbé, de l'Hortulus, le poème didactique du bénédictin Walafrid Strabo, dont le chapitre consacré à la gloire de la citrouille, symbole de la fécondité, le mettait en liesse; du poème d'Ermold le Noir, célébrant les exploits de Louis le Débonnaire, un poème écrit en hexamètres réguliers, dans un style austère, presque noir, dans un latin de fer trempé dans les eaux monastiques, avec, çà et là, des pailles de sentiment dans le dur métal; du De viribus herbarum, le poème de Macer Floridus, qui le délectait particulièrement par ses recettes poétiques et les très étranges vertus qu'il prête à certaines plantes, à certaines fleurs: à l'aristoloche, par exemple, qui, mélangée à de la chair de boeuf et placée sur le bas-ventre d'une femme enceinte, la fait irrémédiablement accoucher d'un enfant mâle; à la bourrache qui, répandue en infusion dans une salle à manger, égaye les convives; à la pivoine dont la racine broyée guérit à jamais du haut mal; au fenouil qui, posé sur la poitrine d'une femme, clarifie ses eaux et stimule l'indolence de ses périodes.","Its attraction diminished with the end of these two centuries; Little delighted, in short, by the heavy mass of Carlovingian Latinists, the Alcuins and the Eginhards, he contented himself, as a specimen of the language in the ninth century, with the chronicles of the anonymous of Saint Gall, of Fréculfe and of Réginon, of the poem on the siege of Paris woven by Abbo le Courbé, Hortulus, the didactic poem of the Benedictine Walafrid Strabo, whose chapter devoted to the glory of the pumpkin, symbol of fertility, made him jubilant; from the poem by Ermold le Noir, celebrating the exploits of Louis le Débonnaire, a poem written in regular hexameters, in an austere, almost black style, in a Latin of iron soaked in monastic waters, with, here and there, straws of feeling in hard metal; of De viribus herbarum, the poem by Macer Floridus, who particularly delighted him with his poetic recipes and the very strange virtues he attributes to certain plants, certain flowers: aristolochia, for example, which, mixed with flesh of beef and placed on the lower abdomen of a pregnant woman, causes her to irretrievably give birth to a male child; borage which, when poured as an infusion in a dining room, brightens up the guests; to the peony, the crushed root of which cures high evil forever; to fennel which, placed on a woman's chest, clarifies her waters and stimulates the indolence of her periods.","His predilection for Latin literature grew feebler as he neared the end of these two centuries, and he could summon up little enthusiasm for the turgid prose of the Carolingian Latinists, the Alcuins and the Eginhards. As specimens of the language of the ninth century, he contented himself with the chronicles by Freculf, Reginon and the anonymous writer of Saint-Gall; with the poem on the Siege of Paris contrived by Abbo le Courbé; and with the Hortulus, the didactic poem by the Benedictine Walafrid Strabo, whose canto devoted to the glorification of the pumpkin as a symbol of fecundity tickled his sense of humour. Another work he appreciated was the poem by Ermold le Noir celebrating the exploits of Louis le Débonnaire, a poem written in regular hexameters, in an austere, even sombre style, an iron idiom chilled in monastic waters but with flaws in the hard metal where feeling showed through; and another, a poem by Macer Floridus, De Viribus Herbarum, which he particularly enjoyed for its poetic recipes and the remarkable virtues it attributed to certain plants and flowers – to the aristolochia, for instance, which mixed with beef and laid on a pregnant woman’s abdomen invariably results in the birth of a male child, or borage, which served as a cordial makes the gloomiest guest merry, or the peony, whose powdered root is a lasting cure for epilepsy, or fennel, which applied to a woman’s bosom clears her urine and stimulates her sluggish periods.","They included the whole series of riddles by Adhelme, Tatwine and Eusebius, who were descendants of Symphosius, and especially the enigmas composed by Saint Boniface, in acrostic strophes whose solution could be found in the initial letters of the verses. His interest diminished with the end of those two centuries. Hardly pleased with the cumbersome mass of Carlovingian Latinists, the Alcuins and the Eginhards, he contented himself, as a specimen of the language of the ninth century, with the chronicles of Saint Gall, Freculfe and Reginon; with the poem of the siege of Paris written by Abbo le Courbe; with the didactic Hortulus, of the Benedictine Walafrid Strabo, whose chapter consecrated to the glory of the gourd as a symbol of fruitfulness, enlivened him; with the poem in which Ermold the Dark, celebrating the exploits of Louis the Debonair, a poem written in regular hexameters, in an austere, almost forbidding style and in a Latin of iron dipped in monastic waters with straws of sentiment, here and there, in the unpliant metal; with the De viribus herbarum, the poem of Macer Floridus, who particularly delighted him because of his poetic recipes and the very strange virtues which he ascribes to certain plants and flowers; to the aristolochia, for example, which, mixed with the flesh of a cow and placed on the lower part of a pregnant woman's abdomen, insures the birth of a male child; or to the borage which, when brewed into an infusion in a dining room, diverts guests; or to the peony whose powdered roots cure epilepsy; or to the fennel which, if placed on a woman's breasts, clears her water and stimulates the indolence of her periods."
"Ah! lui seul était dans le vrai! qu'étaient toutes les pharmacopées évangéliques à côté de ses traités d'hygiène spirituelle? Il ne prétendait rien guérir, n'offrait aux malades aucune compensation, aucun espoir; mais sa théorie du Pessimisme était, en somme, la grande consolatrice des intelligences choisies, des âmes élevées; elle révélait la société telle qu'elle est, insistait sur la sottise innée des femmes, vous signalait les ornières, vous sauvait des désillusions en vous avertissant de restreindre autant que possible vos espérances, de n'en point du tout concevoir, si vous vous en sentiez la force, de vous estimer enfin heureux si, à des moments inopinés, il ne vous dégringolait pas sur la tête de formidables tuiles.","Ah! he alone was right! what were all the evangelical pharmacopoeias next to his treatises on spiritual hygiene? He did not claim to cure anything, offered the sick no compensation, no hope; but his theory of Pessimism was, in short, the great consoler of chosen intelligences, of elevated souls; it revealed society as it is, insisted on the innate stupidity of women, pointed out the ruts to you, saved you from disappointment by warning you to restrict your hopes as much as possible, not to conceive of them at all, if you feel the strength, to finally consider yourself happy if, at unexpected moments, formidable tiles did not fall on your head.","Yes, it was undoubtedly Schopenhauer who was in the right. What, in fact, were all the evangelical pharmacopoeias compared with his treatises on spiritual hygiene? He claimed no cures, offered the sick no compensation, no hope; but when all was said and done, his theory of Pessimism was the great comforter of superior minds and lofty souls; it revealed society as it was, insisted on the innate stupidity of women, pointed out the pitfalls of life, saved you from disillusionment by teaching you to expect as little as possible, to expect nothing at all if you were sufficiently strong-willed, indeed, to consider yourself lucky if you were not constantly visited by some unforeseen calamity.","Ah! Schopenhauer alone was right. Compared with these treatises of spiritual hygiene, of what avail were the evangelical pharmacopœias? He did not claim to cure anything, and he offered no alleviation to the sick. But his theory of pessimism was, in the end, the great consoler of choice intellects and lofty souls. He revealed society as it is, asserted woman's inherent stupidity, indicated the safest course, preserved you from disillusionment by warning you to restrain hopes as much as possible, to refuse to yield to their allurement, to deem yourself fortunate, finally, if they did not come toppling about your ears at some unexpected moment."
"à eux deux, ils représentaient bien les deux partis de l'église où les dissidences se résolvent en d'intraitables haines; de Falloux, plus hautain et plus cauteleux, appartenait à cette secte libérale dans laquelle étaient déjà réunis et de Montalembert et Cochin, et Lacordaire et de Broglie; il appartenait, tout entier, aux idées du Correspondant, une revue qui s'efforçait de couvrir d'un vernis de tolérance les théories impérieuses de l'église; Veuillot, plus débraillé, plus franc, rejetait ces masques, attestait sans hésiter la tyrannie des volontés ultramontaines, avouait et réclamait tout haut l'impitoyable joug de ses dogmes.","between them, they well represented the two parties of the Church where dissidences resolve themselves into intractable hatreds; de Falloux, haughtier and more shrewd, belonged to that liberal sect in which were already united both de Montalembert and Cochin, and Lacordaire and de Broglie; he belonged entirely to the ideas of the Correspondent, a review which endeavored to cover with a veneer of tolerance the imperious theories of the Church; Veuillot, more slovenly, more frank, rejected these masks, attested without hesitation to the tyranny of ultramontane wills, confessed and claimed aloud the pitiless yoke of his dogmas.","Between them they represented to perfection the two parties in the Church whose differences have always turned to uncompromising hatred. Falloux, the more arrogant and cunning of the two, belonged to that liberal sect which already included both Montalembert and Cochin, both Lacordaire and Broglie; he subscribed wholeheartedly to the principles upheld by the Correspondant, a review which did its best to cover the imperious doctrines of the Church with a varnish of tolerance. Veuillot, a more honest, outspoken man, spurned these subterfuges, unhesitatingly admitted the tyranny of ultramontane dictates, openly acknowledged and invoked the merciless discipline of ecclesiastical dogma.","These contestants represented the two parties of the Church, the two factions whose differences were resolved into virulent hatreds. De Falloux, the more haughty and cunning, belonged to the liberal camp which already claimed Montalembert and Cochin, Lacordaire and De Broglie. He subscribed to the principles of the Correspondant, a review which attempted to cover the imperious theories of the Church with a varnish of tolerance. Veuillot, franker and more open, scorned such masks, unhesitatingly admitted the tyranny of the ultramontaine doctrines and confessed, with a certain compunction, the pitiless yoke of the Church's dogma."
"La supercherie elle-même n'était donc pas un crime, mais la réparation de cette supercherie en était un.","The deception itself was therefore not a crime, but the repair of this deception was.","It followed that the fraud itself was not a crime, but that the attempt to make good its failure was.","The deceit itself was not a crime, it seemed. The crime lay in the justification of the deceit."
"Ces retours de la croyance, ces appréhensions de la foi le tourmentaient surtout depuis que des altérations se produisaient dans sa santé; ils coïncidaient avec des désordres nerveux nouvellement venus.","These returns to belief, these apprehensions of faith tormented him especially since alterations were occurring in his health; they coincided with newly arrived nervous disorders.","These recurrences of belief, these fearful intimations of faith had been troubling him more particularly since his health had begun to deteriorate; they coincided with certain nervous disorders that had recently arisen.","These reversions to religion, these intimations of faith tormented him particularly since the changes that had lately taken place in his health.

"Tout, volumes, bibelots, meubles, prit à ses yeux un charme particulier, son lit lui parut plus moelleux, en comparaison de la couchette qu'il aurait occupée à Londres; le discret et silencieux service de ses domestiques l'enchanta, fatigué qu'il était, par la pensée, de la loquacité bruyante des garçons d'hôtel; l'organisation méthodique de sa vie lui fit l'effet d'être plus enviable, depuis que le hasard des pérégrinations devenait possible.","Everything, books, trinkets, furniture, took on a particular charm in his eyes, his bed seemed to him softer, in comparison with the berth he would have occupied in London; the discreet and silent service of his servants enchanted him, tired as he was, in thought, of the noisy talkativeness of waiters; the methodical organization of his life gave him the effect of being more enviable, since the chance of peregrinations had become possible.","Everything indeed – books, bric-à-brac and furniture – acquired a peculiar charm in his eyes. His bed seemed softer in comparison with the pallet he would have occupied in London; the discreet and silent service he got at home delighted him, exhausted as he was by the very thought of the noisy garrulity of hotel waiters; the methodical organization of his daily life appeared more admirable than ever, now that the hazard of travelling was a possibility.","Everything there, books, bric-a-brac and furniture, had an individual charm for him. His bed seemed the softer by comparison with the hard bed he would have occupied in London. The silent, discreet ministrations of his servants charmed him, exhausted as he was at the thought of the loud loquacity of hotel attendants. The methodical organization of his life made him feel that it was especially to be envied since the possibility of traveling had become imminent."
"Et, en effet, la curiosité, la naïveté compliquée du langage chrétien avaient, elles aussi, sombré. Le fatras des philosophes et des scoliastes, la logomachie du moyen âge allaient régner en maîtres. L'amas de suie des chroniques et des livres d'histoire, les saumons de plomb des cartulaires allaient s'entasser, et la grâce balbutiante, la maladresse parfois exquise des moines mettant en un pieux ragoût les restes poétiques de l'antiquité, étaient mortes; les fabriques de verbes aux sucs épurés, de substantifs sentant l'encens, d'adjectifs bizarres, taillés grossièrement dans l'or; avec le goût barbare et charmant des bijoux goths, étaient détruites. Les vieilles éditions, choyées par des Esseintes, cessaient; et, en un saut formidable de siècles, les livres s'étageaient maintenant sur les rayons, supprimant la transition des âges, arrivant directement à la langue française du présent siècle.","And, indeed, curiosity, the complicated naivety of Christian language had also sunk. The jumble of philosophers and scholars, the logomachy of the Middle Ages were to reign supreme. The soot heap of chronicles and history books, the lead salmon of cartularies were about to pile up, and the stammering grace, the sometimes exquisite awkwardness of the monks putting into a pious stew the poetic remains of antiquity, were dead; the factories of verbs with purified juices, of nouns smelling of incense, of bizarre adjectives, roughly cut in gold; with the barbaric and charming taste of goth jewelry, were destroyed. The old editions, pampered by Des Esseintes, ceased; and, in a formidable leap of centuries, the books were now stacked on the shelves, suppressing the transition of the ages, arriving directly at the French language of the present century.","By that time, after all, the peculiar originality and elaborate simplicity of Christian Latinity had likewise come to an end. Henceforth the gibble-gabble of the philosophers and the scholiasts, the logomachy of the Middle Ages, would reign supreme. The sooty heaps of chronicles and history books, the leaden masses of cartularies, would steadily pile up, while the stammering grace, the often exquisite clumsiness of the monks, stirring the poetical left-overs of Antiquity into a pious stew, were already things of the past; the workshop turning out verbs of refined sweetness, substantives smelling of incense, and strange adjectives crudely fashioned out of gold in the delightfully barbaric style of Gothic jewellery, had already closed down. The old editions so beloved of Des Esseintes tailed away to nothing – and making a prodigious jump of several centuries, he stacked the rest of his shelves with modern books which, without regard to the intermediate ages, brought him right down to the French language of the present day.5","And, in fact, the curiosity, the complicated naïveté of the Christian language had also foundered. The balderdash of philosophers and scholars, the logomachy of the Middle Ages, thenceforth held absolute sway. The sooty mass of chronicles and historical books and cartularies accumulated, and the stammering grace, the often exquisite awkwardness of the monks, placing the poetic remains of antiquity in a ragout, were dead. The fabrications of verbs and purified essences, of substantives breathing of incense, of bizarre adjectives, coarsely carved from gold, with the barbarous and charming taste of Gothic jewels, were destroyed. The old editions, beloved by Des Esseintes, here ended; and with a formidable leap of centuries, the books on his shelves went straight to the French language of the present century."

"Il n'avait point, avec cela, la ressource d'employer le laudanum; au lieu de l'apaiser, ce calmant l'irritait jusqu'à le priver de repos. Jadis, il avait voulu se procurer avec l'opium et le haschisch des visions, mais ces deux substances avaient amené des vomissements et des perturbations nerveuses intenses; il avait dû, tout aussitôt, renoncer à les absorber et, sans le secours de ces grossiers excitants, demander à sa cervelle seule, de l'emporter loin de la vie, dans les rêves.","He had not, besides, the resource of employing the laudanum; instead of soothing him, this tranquilizer irritated him to the point of depriving him of rest.

At one time he had also resorted to opium and hashish in the hope of seeing visions, but these two drugs had only brought on vomiting and violent nervous disorders; he had been obliged to stop using them at once and, without the help of these crude stimulants, to ask his brain, alone and unaided, to carry him far away from everyday life into the land of dreams.","With all this, he was unable to make use of laudanum: instead of allaying the pain, this sedative irritated him even to the degree of depriving him of rest. At one time he had endeavored to procure visions through opium and hashish, but these two substances had led to vomitings and intense nervous disturbances. He had instantly been forced to give up the idea of taking them, and without the aid of these coarse stimulants, demand of his brain alone to transport him into the land of dreams, far, far from life."

"Dans l'insensible et impitoyable statue, dans l'innocente et dangereuse idole, l'érotisme, la terreur de l'être humain s'étaient fait jour; le grand lotus avait disparu, la déesse s'était évanouie; un effroyable cauchemar étranglait maintenant l'histrionne, extasiée par le tournoiement de la danse, la courtisane, pétrifiée, hypnotisée par l'épouvante.","In the insensitive and pitiless statue, in the innocent and dangerous idol, the eroticism, the terror of the human being had made its appearance; the great lotus had disappeared, the goddess had vanished; a frightful nightmare now strangled the histrionic, ecstatic by the whirling of the dance, the courtesan, petrified, hypnotized by terror.","In the unfeeling and unpitying statue, in the innocent and deadly idol, the lusts and fears of common humanity had been awakened; the great lotus-blossom had disappeared, the goddess vanished; a hideous nightmare now held in its choking grip an entertainer, intoxicated by the whirling movement of the dance, a courtesan, petrified and hypnotized by terror.","In this insensate and pitiless image, in this innocent and dangerous idol, the eroticism and terror of mankind were depicted. The tall lotus had disappeared, the goddess had vanished; a frightful nightmare now stifled the woman, dizzied by the whirlwind of the dance, hypnotized and petrified by terror."
"Il regagna la salle à manger et mélancoliquement se compara, dans cette cabine, aux passagers atteints du mal de mer; il se dirigea, en trébuchant, vers l'armoire, examina l'orgue à bouche, ne l'ouvrit point, et saisit sur le rayon, plus haut, une bouteille de bénédictine qu'il gardait, à cause de sa forme qui lui semblait suggestive en pensées tout à la fois doucement luxurieuses et vaguement mystiques.","He returned to the dining room and melancholy compared himself, in this cabin, to the passengers suffering from seasickness; he went, stumbling, towards the cupboard, examined the mouth organ, did not open it, and seized on the shelf, higher, a bottle of Benedictine which he kept, because of its shape which seemed suggestive of thoughts that were both gently lustful and vaguely mystical.","Returning to the dining-room, he wryly likened himself, there in his ship’s cabin, to a traveller suffering from seasickness. He staggered over to the cupboard and looked at the mouth organ, but refrained from opening it; instead, he reached up to the shelf above for a bottle of Benedictine – a bottle he kept in the house on account of its shape, which he considered suggestive of ideas at once pleasantly wanton and vaguely mystical.","He again reached the dining room and sadly compared himself, in this cabin, to passengers seized with sea-sickness. Stumbling, he made his way to the closet, examined the mouth organ without opening any of the stops, but instead took from a high shelf a bottle of benedictine which he kept because of its form which to him seemed suggestive of thoughts that were at once gently wanton and vaguely mystic."
"Une soudaine intuition lui vint: c'est la Fleur, se dit-il; et la manie raisonnante persista dans le cauchemar, dériva de même que pendant la journée de la végétation sur le Virus.","A sudden intuition came to him: it's the Flower, he said to himself; and the reasoning mania persisted in the nightmare, drifting just as during the day from the vegetation on the Virus.","A sudden intuition came to him, and he told himself that this must be the Flower. His reasoning mania persisted even in this nightmare; and as in the daytime, it switched from vegetation to the Virus.","A sudden intuition came to him. “It is the Flower,” he said. And his reasoning mania persisted in his nightmare."
"Je respire, se disait-il, au moment où le convoi ralentissait sa valse et s'arrêtait dans la rotonde du débarcadère de Sceaux, en rythmant ses dernières pirouettes, par le fracas saccadé des plaques tournantes.","I'm breathing, he said to himself, as the convoy slowed down its waltz and stopped in the rotunda of the landing stage at Sceaux, punctuating its last pirouettes with the jerky crash of the turntables.","‘Now at last I can breathe,’ he said to himself, as the train waltzed to a stop under the dome of the Paris terminus, dancing its final pirouettes to the staccato accompaniment of the turn-tables.","“I breathe!” he exclaimed when the train moderated its waltz and stopped in the Sceaux station rotunda, panting while its wheels performed its last pirouettes."
"Il se leva et fit plusieurs tours dans sa chambre. - Ce serait tout de même dommage, se dit-il, car, en agissant de la sorte, j'avais réalisé la parabole laïque, l'allégorie de l'instruction universelle qui, ne tendant à rien moins qu'à transmuer tous les gens en des Langlois, s'ingénie, au lieu de crever définitivement et par compassion les yeux des misérables, à les leur ouvrir tout grands et de force, pour qu'ils aperçoivent autour d'eux des sorts immérités et plus cléments, des joies plus laminées et plus aiguës et, par conséquent, plus désirables et plus chères.","He got up and walked around his room several times. - It would be a pity all the same, he said to himself, because, by acting in this way, I had realized the secular parable, the allegory of universal instruction which, tending to nothing less than to transmute all people in Langlois, contrives, instead of definitively and out of compassion gouging out the eyes of the wretched, to open them wide and forcefully, so that they perceive around them undeserved and more lenient fates, joys more laminated and sharper and, therefore, more desirable and more expensive.","He got to his feet and took a few turns round the room. ‘That would be a pity, all the same,’ he went on, ‘because all I was doing was parabolizing secular instruction, allegorizing universal education, which is well on the way to turning everybody into a Langlois: instead of permanently and mercifully putting out the eyes of the poor, it does its best to force them wide open, so that they may see all around them lives of less merit and greater comfort, pleasures that are keener and more voluptuous, and therefore sweeter and more desirable.","Although he experienced no inclination for the state of grace, he felt a genuine sympathy for those souls immured in monasteries, persecuted by a vengeful society which can forgive neither the merited scorn with which it inspires them, nor the desire to expiate, to atone by long silences, for the ever growing shamelessness of its ridiculous or trifling gossipings."
"En somme, des Esseintes n'extrayait même point de cette littérature, une passagère distraction à ses ennuis, aussi repoussait-il dans les angles obscurs de sa bibliothèque ces amas de livres qu'il avait jadis étudiés, lorsqu'il était sorti de chez les Pères. - J'aurais bien dû abandonner ceux-là à Paris, se dit-il, en dénichant derrière les autres, des livres qui lui étaient plus particulièrement insupportables, ceux de l'abbé Lamennais et ceux de cet imperméable sectaire, si magistralement, si pompeusement ennuyeux et vide, le comte Joseph de Maistre.","In short, Des Esseintes did not even extract from this literature a passing distraction from his troubles, so he pushed back into the dark corners of his library those heaps of books he had studied when he left home. the fathers. - I should have abandoned those in Paris, he said to himself, unearthing behind the others books which were more particularly unbearable to him, those of the Abbé Lamennais and those of this sectarian impermeable, so masterfully, so pompously boring and empty, Count Joseph de Maistre.","In a word, Des Esseintes failed to find in this literature even a passing distraction from his boredom; and so he tucked away in the darkest corners of his library all these books that he had read long ago after leaving the Jesuit college. ‘I’d have done better to leave these behind in Paris,’ he muttered, as he pulled out from behind the rest two sets of books he found particularly insufferable: the works of the Abbé Lamennais and those of that fanatical bigot, that pompous bore, that conceited ass, Comte Joseph de Maistre.","In no way did Des Esseintes derive even a fugitive distraction from his boredom from this literature. The mass of books which he had once studied he had thrown into dim corners of his library shelves when he left the Fathers' school. “I should have left them in Paris,” he told himself, as he turned out some books which were particularly insufferable: those of the Abbé Lamennais and that impervious sectarian so magisterially, so pompously dull and empty, the Comte Joseph de Maistre."
"Tandis que l'homme et la femme choisissaient, sur ses indications, les objets utiles à emporter, il arpentait fiévreusement la cabine de la salle à manger, consultait les heures des paquebots, parcourait son cabinet de travail où il continuait à scruter les nuages, d'un air tout à la fois impatient et satisfait.","While the man and the woman were choosing, on his instructions, the useful objects to take away, he feverishly paced the cabin in the dining room, consulted the hours of the liners, went through his study where he continued to scrutinize the clouds, looking both impatient and satisfied.","While the old man and his wife hunted out the things he said he would need, he paced feverishly up and down the cabin-style dining-room, consulted the timetables of the Channel steamers and scrutinized the clouds from his study window with an impatient yet satisfied air.","While the man and the woman were choosing, under his guidance, the necessary equipment, he feverishly paced up and down the cabin of the dining room, consulted the timetables of the steamers, walked through his study where he continued to gaze at the clouds with an air at once impatient and satisfied."
"- Il faut pourtant que j'essaie de manger un peu, se dit-il. Et il tenta de tremper un biscuit dans un vieux Constantia de J.-P. Cloete, dont il lui restait en cave quelques bouteilles.","- But I must try to eat a little, he said to himself. And he tried to dip a biscuit in an old Constantia from J.-P. Cloete, of which he had a few bottles left in the cellar.","‘Still, I really must see if there isn’t something I can eat,’ he muttered – and he tried soaking a biscuit in a glass of old J. P. Cloete Constantia, of which he still had a few bottles in his cellar.","“But I must try to eat something,” he said. And he attempted to soak a biscuit in old Constantia wine, several bottles of which remained in his cellar."
"Peu à peu, il les quitta, et il approcha les hommes de lettres avec lesquels sa pensée devait rencontrer plus d'affinités et se sentir mieux à l'aise. Ce fut un nouveau leurre ; il demeura révolté par leurs jugements rancuniers et mesquins, par leur conversation aussi banale qu'une porte d'église, par leurs dégoûtantes discussions, jaugeant la valeur d'une œuvre selon le nombre des éditions et le bénéfice de la vente. En même temps, il aperçut les libres penseurs, les doctrinaires de la bourgeoisie, des gens qui réclamaient toutes les libertés pour étrangler les opinions des autres, d'avides et d'éhontés puritains, qu'il estima, comme éducation, inférieurs au cordonnier du coin.","Little by little, he left them, and he approached the men of letters with whom his thoughts were to meet more affinities and feel more at ease. This was a new decoy; he remained revolted by their resentful and petty judgments, by their conversation as banal as a church door, by their disgusting discussions, gauging the value of a work according to the number of editions and the profit from the sale. At the same time, he saw the freethinkers, the doctrinaires of the bourgeoisie, people who demanded all the freedoms to strangle the opinions of others, greedy and shameless puritans, whom he considered, in education, inferior to the shoemaker. from the neighborhood.","Little by little, he dropped these people and sought the society of men of letters, imagining that theirs must surely be kindred spirits with which his own mind would feel more at case. A fresh disappointment lay in store for him: he was revolted by their mean, spiteful judgements, their conversation that was as commonplace as a church-door, and the nauseating discussions in which they gauged the merit of a book by the number of editions it went through and the profits from its sale. At the same time, he discovered the free-thinkers, those bourgeois doctrinaires who clamoured for absolute liberty in order to stifle the opinions of other people, to be nothing but a set of greedy, shameless hypocrites whose intelligence he rated lower than the village cobbler’s.","He gradually forsook them to make the acquaintance of literary men, in whom he thought he might find more interest and feel more at ease. This, too, proved disappointing; he was revolted by their rancorous and petty judgments, their conversation as obvious as a church door, their dreary discussions in which they judged the value of a book by the number of editions it had passed and by the profits acquired. At the same time, he noticed that the free thinkers, the doctrinaires of the bourgeoisie, people who claimed every liberty that they might stifle the opinions of others, were greedy and shameless puritans whom, in education, he esteemed inferior to the corner shoemaker. His contempt for humanity deepened."
"Il est bon d'ajouter, pensait des Esseintes, que, pour plus d'équité, ce n'est point l'homme maladroit, qui s'empresse généralement de disparaître, mais bien la femme, victime de la maladresse, qui expie le forfait d'avoir sauvé de la vie un innocent!","It is good to add, des Esseintes thought, that, for greater fairness, it is not the clumsy man, who generally hastens to disappear, but the woman, victim of clumsiness, who expiates the forfeit for having saved an innocent man's life!","It should also be remarked, thought Des Esseintes, that to add to the justice of it all, it was not the unskilful operator – who generally beat a speedy retreat – but the woman in the case, the victim of his clumsiness, who paid the penalty for saving an innocent creature from the misery of life.","It is only right to add, for the sake of fairness, thought Des Esseintes, that it is not the awkward man, who generally loses no time in disappearing, but rather the woman, the victim of his stupidity, who expiates the crime of having saved an innocent life."
"Cette croyance que l'homme est un âne de Buridan, un être tiraillé entre deux puissances d'égale force, qui demeurent, à tour de rôle, victorieuses de son âme et vaincues; cette conviction que la vie humaine n'est plus qu'un incertain combat livré entre l'enfer et le ciel; cette foi en deux entités contraires, Satan et le Christ, devaient fatalement engendrer ces discordes intérieures où l'âme, exaltée par une incessante lutte, échauffée en quelque sorte par les promesses et les menaces, finit par s'abandonner et se prostitue à celui des deux partis dont la poursuite a été la plus tenace.","This belief that man is a Buridan donkey, a being torn between two powers of equal strength, which remain, in turn, victorious over his soul and defeated; this conviction that human life is nothing more than an uncertain battle waged between hell and heaven; this faith in two contrary entities, Satan and Christ, were bound to engender those interior discords where the soul, exalted by an incessant struggle, heated in some way by promises and threats, ends up abandoning itself and prostituting itself to the one of the two parties whose pursuit has been the most tenacious.","The belief that man is an irresolute creature pulled this way and that by two forces of equal strength, alternately winning and losing the battle for his soul; the conviction that human life is nothing more than an uncertain struggle between heaven and hell; the faith in two opposed entities, Satan and Christ – all this was bound to engender those internal discords in which the soul, excited by the incessant fighting, stimulated as it were by the constant promises and threats, ends up by giving in and prostitutes itself to whichever of the two combatants has been the more obstinate in its pursuit.","This belief that man is a Buridanesque donkey, a being balanced between two forces of equal attraction which successively remain victorious and vanquished, this conviction that human life is only an uncertain combat waged between hell and heaven, this faith in two opposite beings, Satan and Christ, was fatally certain to engender such inner discords of the soul, exalted by incessant struggle, excited at once by promises and menaces, and ending by abandoning itself to whichever of the two forces persisted in the pursuit the more relentlessly."
"En outre de cette série des ouvrages de Redon, garnissant presque tous les panneaux du vestibule, il avait pendu dans sa chambre à coucher, une ébauche désordonnée de Théocopuli, un Christ aux teintes singulières, d'un dessin exagéré, d'une couleur féroce, d'une énergie détraquée, un tableau de la seconde manière de ce peintre, alors qu'il était harcelé par la préoccupation de ne plus ressembler au Titien.","In addition to this series of works by Redon, lining almost all the panels of the vestibule, he had hung in his bedroom a disorderly sketch of Theocopuli, a Christ of singular tints, of an exaggerated design, of a ferocious color. , with a deranged energy, a picture of the second style of this painter, when he was harassed by the preoccupation of no longer resembling Titian.","Besides this collection of Redon’s works, covering nearly every panel in the vestibule, he had hung in his bedroom an extravagant sketch by Theotocopuli,7 a study of Christ in which the drawing was exaggerated, the colouring crude and bizarre, the general effect one of frenzied energy, an example of the painter’s second manner, when he was obsessed by the idea of avoiding any further resemblance to Titian.","In addition to this series of the works of Redon which adorned nearly every panel of the passage, he had hung a disturbing sketch by El Greco in his bedroom. It was a Christ done in strange tints, in a strained design, possessing a wild color and a disordered energy: a picture executed in the painter's second manner when he had been tormented by the necessity of avoiding imitation of Titian."
"Une nouvelle plante, d'un modèle similaire à celui des Caladiums, l'""Alosacia Metallica"", l'exalta encore. Celle-là était enduite d'une couche de vert bronze sur laquelle glissaient des reflets d'argent; elle était le chef-d'oeuvre du factice; on eût dit d'un morceau de tuyau de poêle, découpé en fer de pique, par un fumiste.","A new plant, of a model similar to that of the Caladiums, the ""Alosacia Metallica"", further exalted him. This one was coated with a layer of bronze-green over which glinted silver reflections; she was the dummy's masterpiece; it looked like a piece of stovepipe, cut out of spade iron by a smoker.","Another plant, of a type similar to the Caladiums, the Alocasia Metallica, roused him to still greater admiration. Covered with a coat of greenish bronze shot with glints of silver, it was the supreme masterpiece of artifice; anyone would have taken it for a bit of stove-pipe cut into a pike-head pattern by the makers.","A new plant, modelled like the Caladiums, the Alocasia Metallica, excited him even more. It was coated with a layer of bronze green on which glanced silver reflections. It was the masterpiece of artificiality. It could be called a piece of stove pipe, cut by a chimney-maker into the form of a pike head."
"Celle-là, il l'avait regrettée et, au souvenir de ses artifices, les autres femmes lui parurent dénuées de saveur; les grâces pourries de l'enfance lui semblèrent même fades; son mépris pour leurs monotones grimaces devint tel qu'il ne pouvait plus se résoudre à les subir.","That one he had regretted and, remembering his tricks, the other women seemed to him devoid of taste; even the rotten graces of childhood seemed to him insipid; his contempt for their monotonous grimaces became such that he could no longer bring himself to put up with them.","Des Esseintes had been sorry to lose her, and the memory of her artifices made other women seem insipid; even the corrupt graces of depraved children appeared tame in comparison, and he came to feel such contempt for their monotonous grimaces that he could not bring himself to tolerate them any longer.","He had regretted her defection, and now, recalling her, the other women seemed insipid, their childish graces and monotonous coquetry disgusting him."
"Cela fait, il pouvait maintenant enchâsser les pétales de ses fleurs épanouies au milieu du bouquet, de ses fleurs les plus voisines, les plus rapprochées du tronc, avec des minéraux transparents, aux lueurs vitreuses et morbides, aux jets fiévreux et aigres.","That done, he could now enshrine the petals of his blossoming flowers in the middle of the bouquet, of his nearest flowers, closest to the trunk, with transparent minerals, with glassy and morbid gleams, with feverish and sour jets.","This done, he could now go on to encrust the petals of such flowers as were in full bloom in the middle of his spray, those closest to the stem, with translucent minerals that gleamed with a glassy, sickly light and glinted with fierce, sharp bursts of fire.","This done, he could now set the petals of his flowers with transparent stones which had morbid and vitreous sparks, feverish and sharp lights."
"Notant à mesure les faits, les constatant dans une forme définitive, il déroulait la menue existence du peuple, ses épisodes, ses bestialités, ses ruts.","Noting the facts as they went, noting them in a definitive form, he unfolded the little existence of the people, its episodes, its bestialities, its ruts.","Noting what he saw as he saw it, he set forth the day-to-day existence of the common people, with all its minor events, its bestial incidents, its obscene antics.","Observing the facts of life, stating them in clear, definite form, he revealed the petty existence of the people, their happenings, their bestialities, their passions."
"Incapable de s'attaquer à la vie contemporaine, de rendre visible et palpable l'aspect le plus simple des êtres et des choses, inapte à expliquer les ruses compliquées d'une cervelle indifférente à l'état de grâce, cette langue excellait cependant aux sujets abstraits; utile dans la discussion d'une controverse, dans la démonstration d'une théorie, dans l'incertitude d'un commentaire, elle avait, plus que toute autre aussi, l'autorité nécessaire pour affirmer, sans discussion, la valeur d'une doctrine.","Incapable of attacking contemporary life, of making visible and palpable the simplest aspect of beings and things, incapable of explaining the complicated tricks of a brain indifferent to the state of grace, this language nevertheless excelled in abstract subjects; useful in the discussion of a controversy, in the demonstration of a theory, in the uncertainty of a commentary, it had, more than any other also, the authority necessary to affirm, without discussion, the value of a doctrine.","Incapable of dealing with contemporary life, of making visible and palpable the simplest aspect of creatures and things, and ill fitted to explain the complicated ruses of a brain unconcerned about states of grace, this idiom was none the less excellent in the treatment of abstract subjects. Useful in the discussion of a controversy, in the qualification of a commentary, it also possessed more than any other the necessary authority to state dogmatically the value of a doctrine.","Incapable of grappling with contemporary life, of rendering the most simple aspects of things and persons visible and palpable, unqualified to explain the complicated wiles of intellects indifferent to the benefits of salvation, this language was nevertheless excellent when it treated of abstract subjects. It proved valuable in the argument of controversy, in the demonstration of a theory, in the obscurity of a commentary and, more than any other style, had the necessary authority to affirm, without any discussion, the intent of a doctrine."
"Sa liste à la main, des Esseintes appelait, vérifiait ses emplettes, une à une.","With his list in hand, Des Esseintes called, checked his purchases, one by one.","List in hand, Des Esseintes called the roll, checking his purchases one by one.","Des Esseintes holding a list in his hands, verified each one of his purchases."
"Il rumina ces souvenirs, et une après-midi écoulée, à Pantin, par désoeuvrement, par curiosité, en compagnie de cette femme, chez l'une de ses soeurs, lui revint, remuant en lui un monde oublié de vieilles idées et d'anciens parfums; tandis que les deux femmes jacassaient et se montraient leurs robes, il s'était approché de la fenêtre et, au travers des vitrines poudreuses, il avait vu la rue pleine de boue s'étendre et entendu ses pavés bruire sous le coup répété des galoches battant les mares.","He ruminated over these memories, and one afternoon spent in Pantin, out of idleness, out of curiosity, in the company of this woman, at the home of one of his sisters, came back to him, stirring within him a forgotten world of old ideas and old perfumes; While the two women chattered and showed each other their dresses, he had approached the window and, through the dusty shop windows, he had seen the muddy street stretching out and heard its cobblestones rustle under the repeated blow of the galoshes. beating the seas.","As he mused over these recollections, one memory in particular haunted him, stirring up a forgotten world of old thoughts and ancient perfumes – the memory of an afternoon he had spent with this woman at Pantin, partly for want of anything better to do and partly out of curiosity, at the house of one of her sisters. While the two women were chattering away and showing each other their frocks, he had gone to the window and, through the dusty panes, had seen the muddy street stretching into the distance and heard it echo with the incessant beat of galoshes tramping through the puddles.","He mused over these memories, and one afternoon spent at Pantin through idleness and curiosity, in company with this woman at the home of one of her sisters, returned to him, stirring in him a forgotten world of old ideas and perfumes; while the two women prattled and displayed their gowns, he had drawn near the window and had seen, through the dusty panes, the muddy street sprawling before him, and had heard the repeated sounds of galoches over the puddles of the pavement."
"Ses sensations devenaient, dès ce moment, confuses. Vaguement il se souvenait de s'être affaissé, en face d'une fenêtre, dans un fauteuil, d'avoir balbutié, en mettant un doigt sur sa dent: ""elle a été déjà plombée; j'ai peur qu'il n'y ait rien à faire.""","His sensations became, from that moment, confused. Vaguely he remembered sinking into an armchair in front of a window, stammering, putting a finger to his tooth: ""It's already been filled; I'm afraid he's there's nothing to do.""","His recollections of what happened after that were somewhat confused. He vaguely remembered dropping into an armchair facing a window, putting a finger on the offending tooth and stammering out: ‘It has been filled before. I’m afraid there’s nothing can be done this time.’","From this instant, his sensations were confused. He vaguely remembered having sunk into a chair opposite a window, having murmured, as he put a finger to his tooth: “It has already been filled and I am afraid nothing more can be done with it.”"
"- Il est vrai, poursuivit des Esseintes, revenant au point de départ de son raisonnement, il est vrai que la plupart du temps la nature est, à elle seule, incapable de procréer des espèces aussi malsaines et aussi perverses; elle fournit la matière première, le germe et le sol, la matrice nourricière et les éléments de la plante que l'homme élève, modèle, peint, sculpte ensuite à sa guise.","- It is true, continued des Esseintes, returning to the starting point of his reasoning, it is true that most of the time nature is, by itself, incapable of procreating such unhealthy and perverse species; it provides the raw material, the germ and the soil, the nourishing matrix and the elements of the plant that man raises, models, paints, then sculpts as he pleases.","‘It is true,’ continued Des Esseintes, going back to the starting point of his argument, ‘it is true that most of the time Nature is incapable of producing such depraved, unhealthy species alone and unaided; she supplies the raw materials, the seed and the soil, the nourishing womb and the elements of the plant, which man rears, shapes, paints and carves afterwards to suit his fancy.","“It is true,” pursued Des Esseintes, returning to the course of reasoning he had momentarily abandoned, “it is true that most often nature, left alone, is incapable of begetting such perverse and sickly specimens. She furnishes the original substance, the germ and the earth, the nourishing womb and the elements of the plant which man then sets up, models, paints, and sculpts as he wills."
"Aussi, forcément, après les maîtres, s'adressait-il à quelques écrivains que lui rendait encore plus propices et plus chers, le mépris dans lequel les tenait un public incapable de les comprendre.","Also, inevitably, after the masters, he addressed himself to a few writers whom he rendered even more favorable and dearer to him by the contempt in which they were held by a public incapable of understanding them.","It was therefore inevitable that, after the masters, he should turn to certain minor writers whom he found all the more attractive and endearing by reason of the contempt in which they were held by a public incapable of understanding them.","Thus, after the masters, he betook himself to a few writers who attracted him all the more because of the disdain in which they were held by the public incapable of understanding them."
"Et il avait agi de même pour ses papiers. Las, un beau jour, des chines argentés, des japons nacrés et dorés, des blancs whatmans, des hollandes bis, des turkeys et des seychal-mills teints en chamois, et dégoûté aussi par les papiers fabriqués à la mécanique, il avait commandé des vergés à la forme, spéciaux, dans les vieilles manufactures de Vire où l'on se sert encore des pilons naguère usités pour broyer le chanvre. Afin d'introduire un peu de variété dans ses collections il s'était, à diverses reprises, fait expédier de Londres, des étoffes apprêtées, des papiers à poils, des papiers reps et, pour aider à son dédain des bibliophiles, un négociant de Lubeck lui préparait un papier à chandelle perfectionné, bleuté, sonore, un peu cassant, dans la pâte duquel les fétus étaient remplacés par des paillettes d'or semblables à celles qui pointillent l'eau-de-vie de Dantzick.","And he had done the same for his papers. Weary, one fine day, of silver chines, pearly and golden japans, whatmans whites, bis hollandes, turkeys and seychal-mills dyed in chamois, and also disgusted by machine-made papers, he had ordered some shaped rods, special, in the old factories of Vire where they still use the pestles once used to grind the hemp. In order to introduce a little variety into his collections he had, on various occasions, had prepared fabrics, pile papers, rep papers sent from London and, to help his disdain for bibliophiles, a merchant of Lubeck prepared for him a perfect candle-paper, bluish, sonorous, a little brittle, in the paste of which the wisps were replaced by gold flakes similar to those which dot the brandy of Danzick.","He had done the same with the paper for his books. Deciding one fine day that he was tired of the ordinary expensive papers – silver from China, pearly gold from Japan, white from Whatman ’s , greyish brown from Holland, buff from Turkey and the Seychal mills – and disgusted with the machine-made varieties, he had ordered special hand-made papers from the old mills at Vire where they still use pestles once employed to crush hemp-seed. To introduce a little variety into his collection, he had at various times imported certain dressed fabrics from London – flock papers and rep papers – while to help mark his contempt for other bibliophiles, a Lübeck manufacturer supplied him with a glorified candle-paper, bluish in colour, noisy and brittle to the touch, in which the straw fibres were replaced by flakes of gold such as you find floating in Danzig brandy.","He had followed the same method in selecting his papers. Finally growing weary of the snowy Chinese and the nacreous and gilded Japanese papers, the white Whatmans, the brown Hollands, the buff-colored Turkeys and Seychal Mills, and equally disgusted with all mechanically manufactured sheets, he had ordered special laid paper in the mould, from the old plants of Vire which still employ the pestles once in use to grind hemp. To introduce a certain variety into his collection, he had repeatedly brought from London prepared stuffs, paper interwoven with hairs, and as a mark of his disdain for bibliophiles, he had a Lubeck merchant prepare for him an improved candle paper of bottle-blue tint, clear and somewhat brittle, in the pulp of which the straw was replaced by golden spangles resembling those which dot Danzig brandy."
"Ce sentimentalisme imbécile combiné avec une férocité pratique, représentait la pensée dominante du siècle; ces mêmes gens qui auraient éborgné leur prochain, pour gagner dix sous, perdaient toute lucidité, tout flair, devant ces louches cabaretières qui les harcelaient sans pitié et les rançonnaient sans trêve. Des industries travaillaient, des familles se grugeaient entre elles sous prétexte de commerce, afin de se laisser chiper de l'argent par leurs fils qui se laissaient, à leur tour, escroquer par ces femmes que dépouillaient, en dernier ressort, les amants de coeur.","This imbecilic sentimentalism combined with a practical ferocity, represented the dominant thought of the century; these same people who would have slain their neighbor to earn ten sous, lost all lucidity, all flair, before these shady innkeepers who harassed them without pity and held them to ransom without respite. Industries were working, families ate each other under the pretext of trade, in order to let their sons steal money from them, who in turn allowed themselves to be cheated by these women who, in the last resort, were robbed by lovers of the heart. .","This idiotic sentimentality combined with ruthless commercialism clearly represented the dominant spirit of the age; these same men who would have gouged anybody’s eyes out to make a few coppers, lost all their flair and shrewdness when it came to dealing with the shifty tavern girls who harried them without pity and fleeced them without mercy. The wheels of industry turned, and families cheated one another in the name of trade, only to let themselves be robbed of money by their sons, who in turn allowed themselves to be swindled by these women, who in the last resort were bled white by their own fancy men.","This imbecile sentimentality, combined with a ferociously practical sense, represented the dominant motive of the age. These very persons who would have gouged their neighbors' eyes to gain ten sous, lost all presence of mind and discrimination before suspicious looking girls in restaurants who pitilessly harassed and relentlessly fleeced them. Fathers devoted their lives to their businesses and labors, families devoured one another on the pretext of trade, only to be robbed by their sons who, in turn, allowed themselves to be fleeced by women who posed as sweethearts to obtain their money."
"Mais il y avait pis: une lauréate brevetée de l'Institut, madame Augustus Craven, l'auteur du Récit d'une soeur, d'une éliane, d'un Fleurange, soutenus à grand renfort de serpent et d'orgue, par la presse apostolique tout entière. Jamais, non, jamais des Esseintes n'avait imaginé qu'on pût écrire de pareilles insignifiances. Ces livres étaient, au point de vue de la conception, d'une telle nigauderie et ils étaient écrits dans une langue si nauséeuse, qu'ils en devenaient presque personnels, presque rares.","But there was worse: a laureate of the Institut, Madame Augustus Craven, the author of the Story of a Sister, of an Eliane, of a Fleurange, supported with great fanfare of serpent and organ, by the entire apostolic press. Never, no, never had Des Esseintes imagined that such trivialities could be written. These books were so silly in design, and they were written in such nauseating language, that they were almost personal, almost rare.","But there was worse to come: there was Mrs Augustus Craven, an accredited laureate of the Institut, author of the Récit d’une Soeur as well as of an Éliane and a Fleurange, books which were all greeted with blaring trumpets and rolling organ by the entire apostolic press. Never, no never, had Des Esseintes imagined that it was possible to write such trivial trash. These books were based on such stupid concepts and were written in such a nauseating style that they almost acquired a rare and distinctive personality of their own.","But there was even worse: a female laureate licensed by the Institute, Madame Augustus Craven, author of Recit d'une soeur, of Eliane and Fleaurange, puffed into reputation by the whole apostolic press. Never, no, never, had Des Esseintes imagined that any person could write such ridiculous nonsense. In the point of conception, these books were so absurd, and were written in such a disgusting style, that by these tokens they became almost remarkable and rare."
"En faisant naître un idéal extrahumain dans cette âme qu'elle avait baignée et qu'une hérédité datant du règne de Henri III prédisposait peut-être, la religion avait aussi remué l'illégitime idéal des voluptés; des obsessions libertines et mystiques hantaient, en se confondant, son cerveau altéré d'un opiniâtre désir d'échapper aux vulgarités du monde, de s'abîmer, loin des usages vénérés, dans d'originales extases, dans des crises célestes ou maudites, également écrasantes par les déperditions de phosphore qu'elles entraînent.","By giving birth to an extrahuman ideal in this soul which it had bathed and which a heredity dating from the reign of Henry III had perhaps predisposed, religion had also stirred up the illegitimate ideal of voluptuousness; libertine and mystical obsessions haunted, blending together, his brain altered by an obstinate desire to escape the vulgarities of the world, to sink, far from venerated customs, into original ecstasies, into celestial or accursed crises, also overwhelming in terms of the losses of phosphorus they cause.","While implanting an extra-human ideal in this soul of his, which it had thoroughly impregnated and which a hereditary tendency dating from the reign of Henri III had possibly preconditioned, the Christian religion had also instilled an unlawful ideal of voluptuous pleasure; licentious and mystical obsessions merged together to haunt his brain, which was affected with a stubborn longing to escape the vulgarities of life and, ignoring the dictates of consecrated custom, to plunge into new and original ecstasies, into paroxysms celestial or accursed, but equally exhausting in the waste of phosphorus they involved.","In awakening an almost divine ideal in this soul steeped in her precepts—a soul possibly predisposed to the teachings of the Church through hereditary influences dating back from the reign of Henry III, religion had also stirred the illegitimate, forbidden enjoyment of the senses. Licentious and mystical obsessions haunted his brain, they mingled confusedly, and he would often be troubled by an unappeasable desire to shun the vulgarities of the world and to plunge, far from the customs and modes held in such reverence, into convulsions and raptures which were holy or infernal and which, in either case, proved too exhausting and enervating."
"Mais il cherchait à se persuader le contraire, mécontent de ne plus être maître absolu chez lui; il se procura des motifs; il avait dû forcément se tourner du côté du sacerdoce, puisque l'église a, seule, recueilli l'art, la forme perdue des siècles; elle a immobilisé, jusque dans la vile reproduction moderne, le contour des orfèvreries, gardé le charme des calices élancés comme des pétunias, des ciboires aux flancs purs; préservé, même dans l'aluminium, dans les faux émaux, dans les verres colorés, la grâce des façons d'antan. En somme, la plupart des objets précieux, classés au musée de Cluny, et échappés par miracle à l'immonde sauvagerie des sans-culottes, proviennent des anciennes abbayes de France; de même que l'église a préservé de la barbarie, au moyen âge, la philosophie, l'histoire et les lettres, de même elle a sauvé l'art plastique, amené jusqu'à nos jours ces merveilleux modèles de tissus, de joailleries que les fabricants de choses saintes gâtent le plus qu'ils peuvent, sans en pouvoir toutefois altérer la forme initiale, exquise. Il n'y avait dès lors rien de surprenant à ce qu'il eût pourchassé ces antiques bibelots, qu'il eût, avec nombre de collectionneurs, retiré ces reliques de chez les antiquaires de Paris, de chez les brocanteurs de la campagne.","But he tried to persuade himself to the contrary, dissatisfied at no longer being absolute master in his own house; he procured motives; he must necessarily have turned to the side of the priesthood, since the church, alone, collected the art, the lost form of the centuries; it has immobilized, even in the vile modern reproduction, the outline of goldsmithery, preserved the charm of chalices slender like petunias, of ciboriums with pure flanks; preserved, even in the aluminum, in the false enamels, in the colored glasses, the grace of the ways of yesteryear. In short, most of the precious objects, classified in the Cluny museum, and miraculously escaped the filthy savagery of the sans-culottes, come from the old abbeys of France; just as the church preserved from barbarism, in the Middle Ages, philosophy, history and letters, so it saved plastic art, brought up to our days these marvelous models of fabrics, jewels that the manufacturers of holy things spoil as much as they can, without however being able to alter the initial, exquisite form. It was therefore not surprising that he should have hunted down these antique trinkets, that he, along with a number of collectors, should have taken these relics from the antique dealers in Paris, from the second-hand dealers in the countryside.","However, he tried his hardest to persuade himself of the contrary, annoyed at finding that he was no longer master in his own house. Hunting for more acceptable explanations of his ecclesiastical predilections, he told himself he had been obliged to turn to the Church, in that the Church was the only body to have preserved the art of past centuries, the lost beauty of the ages. She had kept unchanged, even in shoddy modern reproductions, the goldsmiths’ traditional forms; preserved the charm of chalices as slender as petunias, of pyxes simply and exquisitely styled; retained, even in aluminium, in fake enamel, in coloured glass, the grace of the patterns of olden days. Indeed, most of the precious objects which were kept in the Cluny Museum, and which by some miracle had escaped the bestial savagery of the sansculottes, came from the old abbeys of France. Just as in the Middle Ages the Church saved philosophy, history and literature from barbarism, so she had safeguarded the plastic arts and brought down to modern times those marvellous examples of costume and jewellery which present-day ecclesiastical furnishers did their best to spoil, though they could never quite succeed in destroying the original qualities of form and style. There was therefore no cause for surprise in the fact that he had hunted eagerly for these antique curios, and that like many another collector he had bought relics of this sort from Paris antiquaries and country dealers.","But he sought to persuade himself to the contrary, disturbed at no longer being his own master. He searched for motives; it had required a struggle for him to abandon things sacerdotal, since the Church alone had treasured objects of art—the lost forms of past ages. Even in its wretched modern reproductions, she had preserved the contours of the gold and silver ornaments, the charm of chalices curving like petunias, and the charm of pyxes with their chaste sides; even in aluminum and imitation enamels and colored glasses, she had preserved the grace of vanished modes. In short, most of the precious objects now to be found in the Cluny museum, which have miraculously escaped the crude barbarism of the philistines, come from the ancient French abbeys. And just as the Church had preserved philosophy and history and letters from barbarism in the Middle Ages, so had she saved the plastic arts, bringing to our own days those marvelous fabrics and jewelries which the makers of sacred objects spoil to the best of their ability, without being able to destroy the originally exquisite form. It followed, then, that there was nothing surprising in his having bought these old trinkets, in his having, together with a number of other collectors, purchased such relics from the antique shops of Paris and the second-hand dealers of the provinces."

"Presque jamais, en effet, les parfums ne sont issus des fleurs dont ils portent le nom; l'artiste qui oserait emprunter à la seule nature ses éléments, ne produirait qu'une oeuvre bâtarde, sans vérité, sans style, attendu que l'essence obtenue par la distillation des fleurs ne saurait offrir qu'une très lointaine et très vulgaire analogie avec l'arôme même de la fleur vivante, épandant ses effluves, en pleine terre.","Almost never, in fact, do perfumes come from the flowers whose name they bear; the artist who dares to borrow its elements from nature alone, would only produce a bastard work, without truth, without style, given that the essence obtained by the distillation of flowers can only offer a very distant and very vulgar analogy with the very aroma of the living flower, spreading its fragrance, in the ground.","Hardly ever, in fact, are perfumes produced from the flowers whose names they bear; and any artist foolish enough to take his raw materials from Nature alone would get only a hybrid result, lacking both conviction and distinction, for the very good reason that the essence obtained by distillation from the flower itself cannot possibly offer more than a very distant, very vulgar analogy with the real aroma of the living flower, rooted in the ground and spreading its effluvia through the open air.","Perfumes, in fact, rarely come from the flowers whose names they bear.

"Ces trois pierres dardaient en effet, des scintillements mystérieux et pervers, douloureusement arrachés du fond glacé de leur eau trouble.","These three stones indeed darted, mysterious and perverse scintillations, painfully torn from the icy bottom of their murky water.","For this purpose he used only Ceylon cat’s-eyes, cymophanes and sapphirines – three stones which all sparkled with mysterious, deceptive flashes, painfully drawn from the icy depths of their turbid water: the cat’s-eye of a greenish grey streaked with concentric veins which seem to shift and change position according to the way the light falls; the cymophane with blue waterings rippling across the floating, milky-coloured centre; the sapphirine which kindles bluish, phosphorescent fires against a dull, chocolate-brown background.","These three stones darted mysterious and perverse scintillations, painfully torn from the frozen depths of their troubled waters."
"En résumé, bien qu'il n'éprouvât aucune vocation pour l'état de grâce, il se sentait une réelle sympathie pour ces gens enfermés dans des monastères, persécutés par une haineuse société qui ne leur pardonne ni le juste mépris qu'ils ont pour elle ni la volonté qu'ils affirment de racheter, d'expier, par un long silence, le dévergondage toujours croissant de ses conversations saugrenues ou niaises.","In summary, although he felt no vocation for the state of grace, he felt a real sympathy for these people shut up in monasteries, persecuted by a hateful society which neither forgives them nor the just contempt they have for her, nor the desire they claim to redeem, to expiate, by a long silence, the ever-increasing wantonness of her preposterous or silly conversations.","In short, although he had no vocation for the state of grace, he was conscious of a genuine fellow-feeling for those who were shut up in religious houses, persecuted by a vindictive society that cannot forgive either the proper contempt they feel for it or their averred intention of redeeming and expiating by years of silence the ever-increasing licentiousness of its silly, senseless conversations.","Although he experienced no inclination for the state of grace, he felt a genuine sympathy for those souls immured in monasteries, persecuted by a vengeful society which can forgive neither the merited scorn with which it inspires them, nor the desire to expiate, to atone by long silences, for the ever growing shamelessness of its ridiculous or trifling gossipings."
"La Comédie de la Mort, de Bresdin, où dans un invraisemblable paysage, hérissé d'arbres, de taillis, de touffes, affectant des formes de démons et de fantômes, couvert d'oiseaux à têtes de rats, à queues de légumes, sur un terrain semé de vertèbres, de côtes, de crânes, des saules se dressent, noueux et crevassés, surmontés de squelettes agitant, les bras en l'air, un bouquet, entonnant un chant de victoire, tandis qu'un Christ s'enfuit dans un ciel pommelé, qu'un ermite réfléchit, la tête dans ses deux mains, au fond d'une grotte, qu'un misérable meurt épuisé de privations, exténué de faim, étendu sur le dos, les pieds devant une mare.","La Comédie de la Mort, of Bresdin, where in an incredible landscape, bristling with trees, thickets, tufts, taking on the forms of demons and ghosts, covered with birds with rat heads, vegetable tails, on a ground strewn with vertebrae, ribs, skulls, willows stand, gnarled and cracked, surmounted by waving skeletons, arms in the air, a bouquet, intoning a song of victory, while a Christ flees in a dappled sky, that a hermit reflects, his head in his two hands, at the bottom of a cave, that a wretch dies exhausted from privations, exhausted from hunger, stretched out on his back, his feet in front of a pond.","One of these was Bresdin’s Comedy of Death.4 This depicts an improbable landscape which bristles with trees, coppices and thickets in the shape of demons or phantoms and full of birds with rats’ heads and vegetable tails. From the ground, which is littered with vertebrae, ribs and skulls, there spring gnarled and shaky willow-trees, in which skeletons are perched, waving bouquets and chanting songs of victory, while a Christ flies away into a mackerel sky; a hermit meditates, with his head in his hands, at the back of a grotto; and a beggar dies of privation and hunger, stretched out on his back, his feet pointing to a stagnant pool.","There was Bresdin's Comedy of Death in which, in the fantastic landscape bristling with trees, brushwood and tufts of grass resembling phantom, demon forms, teeming with rat-headed, pod-tailed birds, on earth covered with ribs, skulls and bones, gnarled and cracked willows rear their trunks, surmounted by agitated skeletons whose arms beat the air while they intone a song of victory.

"L'opération réussit et des Esseintes ne put s'empêcher de s'adresser de tacites félicitations à propos de cet événement qui couronnait, en quelque sorte, l'existence qu'il s'était créée; son penchant vers l'artificiel avait maintenant, et sans même qu'il l'eût voulu, atteint l'exaucement suprême; on n'irait pas plus loin; la nourriture ainsi absorbée était, à coup sûr, la dernière déviation qu'on pût commettre.","The operation succeeded and Des Esseintes could not help addressing tacit congratulations on this event which crowned, in a way, the existence he had created for himself; his penchant for the artificial had now, and without his even wishing it, reached supreme fulfillment; we would go no further; the food thus absorbed was certainly the last deviation one could commit.","The operation was successfully carried out, and Des Esseintes could not help secretly congratulating himself on this experience which was, so to speak, the crowning achievement of the life he had planned for himself; his taste for the artificial had now, without even the slightest effort on his part, attained its supreme fulfilment.

"Chez de Goncourt, c'était la nostalgie du siècle précédent, un retour vers les élégances d'une société à jamais perdue. Le gigantesque décor des mers battant les môles, des déserts se déroulant à perte de vue sous de torrides firmaments, n'existait pas dans son oeuvre nostalgique qui se confinait, près d'un parc aulique, dans un boudoir attiédi par les voluptueux effluves d'une femme au sourire fatigué, à la moue perverse, aux prunelles irrésignées et pensives. L'âme dont il animait ses personnages, n'était plus cette âme insufflée par Flaubert à ses créatures, cette âme révoltée d'avance par l'inexorable certitude qu'aucun bonheur nouveau n'était possible; c'était une âme révoltée après coup, par l'expérience, de tous les inutiles efforts qu'elle avait tentés pour inventer des liaisons spirituelles plus inédites et pour remédier à cette immémoriale jouissance qui se répercute, de siècles en siècles, dans l'assouvissement plus ou moins ingénieux des couples.","With de Goncourt, it was the nostalgia of the previous century, a return to the elegance of a society forever lost. The gigantic decor of the seas beating the moles, of the deserts unfolding as far as the eye can see under torrid firmaments, did not exist in his nostalgic work which was confined, near an aulic park, in a boudoir warmed by the voluptuous scents of a woman with a tired smile, a perverse pout, irresigned and thoughtful eyes. The soul with which he animated his characters was no longer that soul breathed into his creatures by Flaubert, that soul revolted in advance by the inexorable certainty that no new happiness was possible; she was a soul revolted afterwards, by the experience of all the useless efforts she had made to invent more unprecedented spiritual connections and to remedy this immemorial enjoyment which reverberates, from century to century, in the soul. more or less ingenious satisfaction of couples.","With Goncourt3 it was a case of nostalgia for the eighteenth century, a longing to return to the elegant graces of a society that had vanished for ever. The gigantic backcloth of seas dashing against great backwaters, of deserts stretching away to infinity under blazing skies, found no place in his nostalgic masterpiece, which confined itself, within the precincts of an aristocratic park, to a boudoir warm with the voluptuous effluvia of a woman with a weary smile, a pouting expression and pensive, brooding eyes. Nor was the spirit with which he animated his characters the same spirit Flaubert breathed into his creations, a spirit revolted in advance by the inexorable certainty that no new happiness was possible; it was rather a spirit revolted after the event, by bitter experience, at the thought of all the fruitless efforts it had made to invent new spiritual relationships and to introduce a little variety into the immemorial pleasure that is repeated down the ages in the satisfaction, more or less ingeniously obtained, of lusting couples.","In de Goncourt, it was the nostalgia of the preceding century, a return to the elegances of a society forever lost. The stupendous setting of seas beating against jetties, of deserts stretching under torrid skies to distant horizons, did not exist in his nostalgic work which confined itself to a boudoir, near an aulic park, scented with the voluptuous fragrance of a woman with a tired smile, a perverse little pout and unresigned, pensive eyes. The soul with which he animated his characters was not that breathed by Flaubert into his creatures , no longer the soul early thrown in revolt by the inexorable certainty that no new happiness is possible; it was a soul that had too late revolted, after the experience, against all the useless attempts to invent new spiritual liaisons and to heighten the enjoyment of lovers, which from immemorial times has always ended in satiety."
"Ne pouvant plus s'enivrer à nouveau des magies du style, s'énerver sur le délicieux sortilège de l'épithète rare qui, tout en demeurant précise, ouvre cependant à l'imagination des initiés, des au-delà sans fin, il se résolut à parachever l'ameublement du logis, à se procurer des fleurs précieuses de serre, à se concéder ainsi une occupation matérielle qui le distrairait, lui détendrait les nerfs, lui reposerait le cerveau, et il espérait aussi que la vue de leurs étranges et splendides nuances le dédommagerait un peu des chimériques et réelles couleurs du style que sa diète littéraire allait lui faire momentanément oublier ou perdre.","No longer able to get drunk again on the magic of style, getting excited over the delicious spell of the rare epithet which, while remaining precise, nevertheless opens up to the imagination of the initiated, endless beyonds, he resolved to complete the furnishing of the dwelling, to procure precious flowers from the hothouse, to thus concede to himself a material occupation which would distract him, relax his nerves, rest his brain, and he also hoped that the sight of their strange and Splendid shades would compensate him somewhat for the chimerical and real colors of the style that his literary diet was about to cause him to momentarily forget or lose.","No longer able to intoxicate himself afresh with the magical charms of style, to thrill to the delicious sorcery of the unusual epithet which, while retaining all its precision, opens up infinite perspectives to the imagination of the initiate, he made up his mind to complete the interior decoration of his thebaid by filling it with costly hothouse flowers, and so provide himself with a material occupation that would distract his thoughts, soothe his nerves and rest his brain.

"En raison de son maquillage et de son air factice, ce paysage ne déplaisait pas à des Esseintes; mais, depuis cette après-midi occupée dans le hameau de Fontenay à la recherche d'une maison, jamais il ne s'était, pendant le jour, promené sur les routes; la verdure de ce pays ne lui inspirait, du reste, aucun intérêt, car elle n'offrait même pas ce charme délicat et dolent que dégagent les attendrissantes et maladives végétations poussées, à grand-peine, dans les gravats des banlieues, près des remparts. Puis, il avait aperçu, dans le village, ce jour-là, des bourgeois ventrus, à favoris, et des gens costumés, à moustaches, portant, ainsi que des saints-sacrements, des têtes de magistrats et de militaires; et, depuis cette rencontre, son horreur s'était encore accrue, de la face humaine.","Des Esseintes was not displeased by his make-up and his artificial air; but, since that busy afternoon in the hamlet of Fontenay in search of a house, he had never, during the day, walked on the roads; the greenery of this country did not inspire him, moreover, any interest, because it did not even offer this delicate and doleful charm which exude the tender and sickly vegetations pushed, with great difficulty, in the rubble of the suburbs, near the ramparts. . Then, he had seen, in the village, that day, pot-bellied bourgeois, with whiskers, and people in costume, with mustaches, carrying, as well as holy sacraments, the heads of magistrates and soldiers; and since that meeting his horror of the human face had increased still further.","On account of its artificial, made-up appearance, Des Esseintes found this landscape not unattractive; but since that first afternoon he had spent house-hunting in the village of Fontenay, he had never once set foot in its streets by day. The greenery of this part of the country had no appeal whatever for him, lacking as it did even that languid, melancholy charm possessed by the pitiful, sickly vegetation clinging pathetically to life on the suburban rubbish-heaps near the ramparts. And then, on that same day, in the village itself, he had caught sight of bewhiskered bourgeois with protuberant paunches and mustachioed individuals in fancy dress, whom he took to be magistrates and army officers, carrying their heads as proudly as a priest would carry a monstrance; and after that experience his detestation of the human face had grown even fiercer than before.","Because of its enameled look and its artificial air, the landscape did not displease Des Esseintes. But since that afternoon spent at Fontenay in search of a house, he had never ventured along its roads in daylight. The verdure of this region inspired him with no interest whatever, for it did not have the delicate and doleful charm of the sickly and pathetic vegetation which forces its way painfully through the rubbish heaps of the mounds which had once served as the ramparts of Paris. That day, in the village, he had perceived corpulent, bewhiskered bourgeois citizens and moustached uniformed men with heads of magistrates and soldiers, which they held as stiffly as monstrances in churches. And ever since that encounter, his detestation of the human face had been augmented."
"Mais cette langue n'était pas demeurée, depuis la période de 1830, stationnaire. Elle avait encore évolué, et, se modelant sur la marche du siècle, elle s'était avancée parallèlement avec les autres arts, s'était, elle aussi, pliée aux voeux des amateurs et des artistes, se lançant sur le Chinois et le Japonais, imaginant des albums odorants, imitant les bouquets de fleurs de Takéoka, obtenant par des alliances de lavande et de girofle, l'odeur du Rondéletia; par un mariage de patchouli et de camphre, l'arôme singulier de l'encre de Chine; par des composés de citron, de girofle et de néroli, l'émanation de l'Hovénia du Japon.","But this language had not remained stationary since the period of 1830.

"Celui-là s'était fabriqué, pour la lutte, une langue particulière, où il entrait du La Bruyère et du faubourien du Gros-Caillou. Ce style mi-solennel, mi-canaille, brandi par cette personnalité brutale, prenait un poids redoutable de casse-tête. Singulièrement entêté et brave, il avait assommé avec ce terrible outil, et les libres penseurs et les évêques, tapant à tour de bras, frappant comme un boeuf sur ses ennemis, à quelque parti qu'ils appartinssent. Tenu en défiance par l'église qui n'admettait ni ce style de contrebande ni ces poses de barrière, ce religieux arsouille s'était quand même imposé par son grand talent, ameutant après lui toute la presse qu'il étrillait jusqu'au sang dans ses Odeurs de Paris, tenant tête à tous les assauts, se débarrassant à coups de soulier de tous les bas plumitifs qui s'essayaient à lui sauter aux jambes.","This one had made up, for the fight, a particular language, into which he entered La Bruyère and the faubourien du Gros-Caillou. This half-solemn, half-rabble style, brandished by this brutal personality, took on a formidable weight of headache. Singularly stubborn and brave, he had stunned with this terrible tool, both free thinkers and bishops, striking with all his might, striking like an ox at his enemies, to whatever party they belonged. Held in distrust by the church, which did not accept either this style of smuggling or these poses of barriers, this religious arsouille had nevertheless imposed himself by his great talent, stirring up after him all the press whom he curryed until blood in his Odeurs de Paris, standing up to all attacks, throwing off all the penetrating stockings that tried to jump on his legs.","The latter writer had fashioned for the fight a special language which owed something to La Bruyère and something to the working-man living out in the Gros-Caillou. This style, half solemn, half vulgar, and wielded by such a brutal character, had the crushing weight of a life-preserver. An extraordinarily brave and stubborn fighter, Veuillot had used this dreadful weapon to fell free-thinkers and bishops alike, laying about him with all his might, lashing out savagely at his foes whether they belonged to one party or the other. Held in suspicion by the Church, which disapproved of both his contraband idiom and his cut-throat conduct, this religious blackguard had none the less compelled recognition by sheer force of talent, goading the Press on till he had the whole pack at his heels, pummelling them till he drew blood in his Odeurs de Paris, standing up to every attack, kicking himself free of the vile pen-pushers that came snapping and snarling after him.","For the conduct of this verbal warfare, Veuillot had made himself master of a special style, partly borrowed from La Bruyère and Du Gros-Caillou. This half-solemn, half-slang style, had the force of a tomahawk in the hands of this vehement personality. Strangely headstrong and brave, he had overwhelmed both free thinkers and bishops with this terrible weapon, charging at his enemies like a bull, regardless of the party to which they belonged. Distrusted by the Church, which would tolerate neither his contraband style nor his fortified theories, he had nevertheless overawed everybody by his powerful talent, incurring the attack of the entire press which he effectively thrashed in his Odeurs de Paris, coping with every assault, freeing himself with a kick of the foot of all the wretched hack-writers who had presumed to attack him."
"Mais ces simili-douches n'enrayaient nullement la marche de la névrose; tout au plus éprouvait-il un soulagement de quelques heures, chèrement payé du reste par le retour des accès qui revenaient à la charge, plus violents et plus vifs.","But these imitation showers in no way checked the progress of the neurosis; at most he experienced a relief of a few hours, paid dearly for the rest by the return of attacks which returned to the charge, more violent and more acute.","But these substitute douches were far from checking the progress of his neurosis; at the very most they gave him a few hours’ relief, and dear-bought relief at that, considering that his nervous troubles soon returned to the attack with renewed vigour and violence.","But these measures failed to stem the march of his nervous disorder. At best they afforded him a few hours' relief, dearly paid for by the return of the attacks in an even more virulent form."
"D'ailleurs les plans qu'il s'était proposés, avaient mûri. Il se résolut à accomplir des projets jusqu'alors irréalisables.","Besides, the plans he had proposed had matured. He resolved to accomplish projects that had been impossible until then.","Besides, the plans he had in view were ripe for execution, and he decided it was time to carry out a hitherto impracticable project.","Certain plans he had long pondered upon ripened, and he decided to bring them to fruition."
"Puis, la vision s'éteignit brusquement avec un cahot du fiacre qui le fit rebondir sur la banquette. Il regarda par les portières; la nuit était venue; les becs de gaz clignotaient, au milieu d'un halo jaunâtre, en pleine brume; des rubans de feux nageaient dans des mares et semblaient tourner autour des roues des voitures qui sautaient dans de la flamme liquide et sale; il tenta de se reconnaître, aperçut le Carrousel et, subitement, sans motif, peut-être par le simple contre-coup de la chute qu'il faisait du haut d'espaces feints, sa pensée rétrograda jusqu'au souvenir d'un incident trivial: il se rappela que le domestique avait négligé de mettre, tandis qu'il le regardait préparer ses malles, une brosse à dents parmi les ustensiles de son nécessaire de toilette; alors il passa en revue la liste des objets empaquetés; tous avaient été rangés dans sa valise, mais la contrariété d'avoir omis cette brosse persista jusqu'à ce que le cocher, en s'arrêtant, rompit la chaîne de ces réminiscences et de ces regrets.","Then, the vision was suddenly extinguished with a jolting of the cab which made it bounce on the seat. He looked through the doors; night had come; the gaslights flickered, in the middle of a yellowish halo, in the midst of the mist; ribbons of fire swam in pools and seemed to revolve around the wheels of cars which jumped in the liquid and dirty flame; he tried to recognize himself, saw the Carrousel and, suddenly, without reason, perhaps by the simple backlash of the fall he was making from the top of feigned spaces, his thoughts regressed to the memory of an incident trivial: he remembered that the servant had neglected to put, while he watched him packing his trunks, a toothbrush among the utensils of his toilet bag; then he reviewed the list of packed objects; they had all been put away in his suitcase, but the annoyance at having omitted this brush persisted until the coachman, stopping, broke the chain of these reminiscences and regrets.","But then the vision vanished as the cab suddenly jolted him up and down on the seat. He looked out of the windows and saw that night had fallen; the gas lamps were flickering in the fog, each surrounded by its dirty yellow halo, while strings of lights seemed to be swimming in the puddles and circling the wheels of the carriages that jogged along through a sea of filthy liquid fire. Des Esseintes tried to see where he was and caught sight of the Arc du Carrousel; and at that very moment, for no reason except perhaps as a reaction from his recent imaginative flights, his mind fixed on the memory of an utterly trivial incident. He suddenly remembered that, when the servant had packed his bags under his supervision, the man had forgotten to put a toothbrush with his other toilet necessaries. He mentally reviewed the list of belongings which had been packed and found that everything else had been duly fitted into his portmanteau; but his annoyance at having left his toothbrush behind persisted until the cabby drew up and so broke the chain of his reminiscences and regrets.","Then the vision faded suddenly with a jolt of the fiacre which made him rebound in his seat. He gazed through the carriage windows. Night had fallen; gas burners blinked through the fog, amid a yellowish halo; ribbons of fire swam in puddles of water and seemed to revolve around wheels of carriages moving through liquid and dirty flame. He endeavored to get his bearings, perceived the Carrousel and suddenly, unreasoningly, perhaps through the simple effect of the high fall from fanciful spaces, his thought reverted to a very trivial incident. He remembered that his domestic had neglected to put a tooth brush in his belongings. Then, he passed in review the list of objects packed up; everything had been placed in his valise, but the annoyance of having omitted this brush persisted until the driver, pulling up, broke the chain of his reminiscences and regrets."
"Il se décida enfin pour des minéraux dont les reflets devaient s'alterner: pour l'hyacinthe de Compostelle, rouge acajou; l'aigue marine, vert glauque; le rubis-balais, rose vinaigre; le rubis de Sudermanie, ardoise pâle. Leurs faibles chatoiements suffisaient à éclairer les ténèbres de l'écaille et laissaient sa valeur à la floraison des pierreries qu'ils entouraient d'une mince guirlande de feux vagues.","He finally decided on minerals whose reflections were to alternate: for the hyacinth of Compostela, mahogany red; aquamarine, glaucous green; the ruby-brushes, rose vinegar; the ruby of Sudermania, pale slate. Their faint shimmer was enough to illuminate the darkness of the shell and left its value to the flowering of the jewels which they surrounded with a thin garland of vague fires.","He finally decided on a series of stones with contrasting colours – the mahogany-red hyacinth of Compostella followed by the sea-green aquamarine, the vinegar-pink balas ruby by the pale slate-coloured Sudermania ruby. Their feeble lustre would be sufficient to set off the dark shell but not enough to detract from the bunch of jewelled flowers which they were to frame in a slender garland of subdued brilliance.","He finally decided on minerals whose reflections vary; for the Compostelle hyacinth, mahogany red; the beryl, glaucous green; the balas ruby, vinegar rose; the Sudermanian ruby, pale slate. Their feeble sparklings sufficed to light the darkness of the shell and preserved the values of the flowering stones which they encircled with a slender garland of vague fires."
"Cet état si curieux et si mal défini ne peut, en effet, prendre naissance dans l'âme d'un mécréant; il ne consiste point seulement à se vautrer parmi les excès de la chair, aiguisés par de sanglants sévices, car il ne serait plus alors qu'un écart des sens génésiques, qu'un cas de satyriasis arrivé à son point de maturité suprême; il consiste avant tout dans une pratique sacrilège, dans une rébellion morale, dans une débauche spirituelle, dans une aberration tout idéale, toute chrétienne; il réside aussi dans une joie tempérée par la crainte, dans une joie analogue à cette satisfaction mauvaise des enfants qui désobéissent et jouent avec des matières défendues, par ce seul motif que leurs parents leur en ont expressément interdit l'approche.","This state, so curious and so ill-defined, cannot, in fact, arise in the soul of an unbeliever; it does not consist only in wallowing among the excesses of the flesh, sharpened by bloody cruelty, for it would then be no more than a departure from the reproductive senses, a case of satyriasis having reached its point of supreme maturity; it consists above all in a sacrilegious practice, in a moral rebellion, in a spiritual debauchery, in an entirely ideal, entirely Christian aberration; it resides also in a joy tempered by fear, in a joy analogous to that evil satisfaction of children who disobey and play with forbidden matters, for the sole reason that their parents have expressly forbidden them the approach.","This strange and ill-defined condition cannot in fact arise in the mind of an unbeliever. It does not consist simply in riotous indulgence of the flesh, stimulated by bloody acts of cruelty, for in that case it would be nothing more than a deviation of the genetic instincts, a case of satyriasis developed to its fullest extent; it consists first and foremost in a sacrilegious manifestation, in a moral rebellion, in a spiritual debauch, in a wholly idealistic, wholly Christian aberration. There is also something in it of joy tempered by fear, a joy analogous to the wicked delight of disobedient children playing with forbidden things for no other reason than that their parents have expressly forbidden them to go near them.","This condition, at once fascinating and ambiguous, can not arise in the soul of an unbeliever. It does not merely consist in sinking oneself in the excesses of the flesh, excited by outrageous blasphemies, for in such a case it would be no more than a case of satyriasis that had reached its climax. Before all, it consists in sacrilegious practice, in moral rebellion, in spiritual debauchery, in a wholly ideal aberration, and in this it is exemplarily Christian. It also is founded upon a joy tempered by fear, a joy analogous to the satisfaction of children who disobey their parents and play with forbidden things, for no reason other than that they had been forbidden to do so."
"Basé sur cette observation plus ou moins juste que les yeux de certains animaux, des boeufs, par exemple, conservent jusqu'à la décomposition, de même que des plaques photographiques, l'image des êtres et des choses situés, au moment où ils expiraient, sous leur dernier regard, ce conte dérivait évidemment de ceux d'Edgar Poe, dont il s'appropriait la discussion pointilleuse et l'épouvante.","Based on this more or less correct observation that the eyes of certain animals, oxen, for example, preserve until decomposition, just as photographic plates, the image of beings and things located, at the moment when they expired , under their last look, this tale was obviously derived from those of Edgar Poe, whose punctilious discussion and horror he appropriated.","Based on the more or less valid observation that, until decomposition sets in, the eyes of certain animals, oxen for instance, preserve like photographic plates the image of the people and things lying at the moment of death within the range of their last look, the tale obviously owed a great deal to those of Edgar Allan Poe, from which it derived its wealth of punctilious detail and its horrific atmosphere.","Based on this more or less just observation that the eyes of certain animals, cows for instance, preserve even to decomposition, like photographic plates, the image of the beings and things their eyes behold at the moment they expire, this story evidently derived from Poe, from whom he appropriated the terrifying and elaborate technique."
"Ici, des Esseintes reprenait pied. Certes, il était satisfait de cet aveu de l'ordure sociale, mais alors, il se révoltait contre le vague remède d'une espérance en une autre vie. Schopenhauer était plus exact; sa doctrine et celle de l'église partaient d'un point de vue commun; lui aussi se basait sur l'iniquité et sur la turpitude du monde, lui aussi jetait avec l'Imitation de Notre-Seigneur, cette clameur douloureuse: ""C'est vraiment une misère que de vivre sur la terre!"" Lui aussi prêchait le néant de l'existence, les avantages de la solitude, avisait l'humanité que quoi qu'elle fît, de quelque côté qu'elle se tournât, elle demeurerait malheureuse: pauvre, à cause des souffrances qui naissent des privations, riche, en raison de l'invincible ennui qu'engendre l'abondance; mais il ne vous prônait aucune panacée, ne vous berçait, pour remédier à d'inévitables maux, par aucun leurre.","Here Des Esseintes regained his footing. Of course, he was satisfied with this admission of social filth, but then he revolted against the vague remedy of a hope in another life. Schopenhauer was more exact; his doctrine and that of the church started from a common point of view; he too based himself on the iniquity and the turpitude of the world, he too threw out with the Imitation of Our Lord, this painful cry: ""It is truly a misery to live on earth!"" He too preached the nothingness of existence, the advantages of solitude, advising humanity that whatever it did, whichever way it turned, it would remain unhappy: poor, because of the sufferings which arise from privations. , rich, because of the invincible boredom engendered by abundance; but he did not advocate any panacea for you, nor rocked you, to remedy inevitable evils, by any lure.","At this point, Des Esseintes found his footing again. It is true that this admission of social corruption had his entire approval, but on the other hand, his mind revolted against the vague remedy of hope in a future life. Schopenhauer, in his opinion, came nearer to the truth.4 His doctrine and the Church’s started from a common point of view; he too took his stand on the iniquity and rottenness of the world; he too cried out in anguish with the Imitation of Christ:5 ‘ Verily it is a pitiful thing to live on earth!’ He too preached the nullity of existence, the advantages of solitude, and warned humanity that whatever it did, whichever way it turned, it would always remain unhappy – the poor because of the sufferings born of privation, the rich because of the unconquerable boredom engendered by abundance. The difference between them was that he offered you no panacea, beguiled you with no promises of a cure for your inevitable ills.","Here, Des Esseintes was on firm ground. He was thoroughly satisfied with this admission of social ordure, but he revolted against the vague hope of remedy in the beyond. Schopenhauer was more true. His doctrine and that of the Church started from common premises. He, too, based his system on the vileness of the world; he, too, like the author of the Imitation of Christ, uttered that grievous outcry: “Truly life on earth is wretched.” He, also, preached the nothingness of life, the advantages of solitude, and warned humanity that no matter what it does, in whatever direction it may turn, it must remain wretched, the poor by reason of the sufferings entailed by want, the rich by reason of the unconquerable weariness engendered by abundance; but this philosophy promised no universal remedies, did not entice one with false hopes, so as to minimize the inevitable evils of life."
"Et pourtant elle était la première à s'arrêter devant lui, dans le passage ininterrompu de ces luxures; mais, au fond, si elle s'était plus énergiquement empreinte dans sa mémoire qu'une foule d'autres dont les appâts avaient été moins fallacieux et les plaisirs moins limités, cela tenait à sa senteur de bête bien portante et saine; la redondance de sa santé était l'antipode même de cette anémie, travaillée aux parfums, dont il retrouvait un fin relent dans le délicat bonbon de Siraudin.","And yet she was the first to stop in front of him, in the uninterrupted passage of these lusts; but, basically, if she had been more energetically imprinted on his memory than a crowd of others whose allurements had been less fallacious and whose pleasures were less limited, that was due to her scent of a healthy and healthy animal; the redundancy of his health was the very antipode of this anemia, worked on in perfumes, of which he found a fine hint in the delicate candy of Siraudin.","Nevertheless, of all the women in this unending procession of lascivious memories, she was the first to halt in front of him; but the fact was that if she had made a deeper impression on his memory than a host of others whose charms had been less fallacious and whose endearments had been less limited, that was because of the healthy, wholesome animal smell she exuded; her superabundant health was the very antipode of the anaemic, scented savour he could detect in the dainty Siraudin sweet.","But if she was more strongly imprinted on his memory than a host of others whose allurements had been less spurious and more seductive, the reason must be ascribed to her healthy animalism, to her exuberance which contrasted so strikingly with the perfumed anæmia of the others, a faint suggestion of which he found in the delicate Siraudin bonbon."
"Tout en se tenant la mâchoire, il se demandait comment faire. Les dentistes qui le soignaient étaient de riches négociants qu'on ne voyait point à sa guise; il fallait convenir avec eux de visites, d'heures de rendez-vous. C'est inacceptable, je ne puis différer plus longtemps, disait-il; il se décida à aller chez le premier venu, à courir chez un quenottier du peuple, un de ces gens à poigne de fer qui, s'ils ignorent l'art bien inutile d'ailleurs de panser les caries et d'obturer les trous, savent extirper, avec une rapidité sans pareille, les chicots les plus tenaces; chez ceux-là, c'est ouvert au petit jour et l'on n'attend pas. Sept heures sonnèrent enfin. Il se précipita hors de chez lui, et se rappelant le nom connu d'un mécanicien qui s'intitulait dentiste populaire et logeait au coin d'un quai, il s'élança dans les rues en mordant son mouchoir, en renfonçant ses larmes.","While holding his jaw, he wondered what to do. The dentists who cared for him were wealthy merchants who were not seen as they pleased; it was necessary to agree with them on visits, on meeting times. This is unacceptable, I cannot delay any longer, he said; he decided to go to the first comer, to run to a popular quenottier, one of those people with an iron fist who, if they are unaware of the quite useless art of dressing cavities and sealing holes , know how to root out, with unparalleled speed, the most stubborn snags; with those, it's open at daybreak and you don't wait. Seven o'clock finally struck. He rushed out of his house, and remembering the well-known name of a mechanic who called himself a popular dentist and lived on the corner of a quay, he dashed into the streets, biting his handkerchief, suppressing his tears.","Nursing his jawbone, he asked himself exactly what he should do when morning came. The dentists he usually consulted were well-to-do businessmen who could not be seen at short notice; appointments had to be made in advance and times agreed. ‘That’s out of the question,’ he told himself. ‘I can’t wait any longer.’ He made up his mind to go and see the first dentist he could find, to resort to a common, lower-class tooth-doctor, one of those iron-fisted fellows who, ignorant though they may be of the useless art of treating decay and filling cavities, know how to extirpate the most stubborn of stumps with unparalleled speed. Their doors are always open at daybreak, and their customers are never kept waiting. Seven o’clock struck at last. He rushed out of doors, and remembering the name of a mechanic who called himself a dentist and lived in a corner house by the river, he hurried in that direction, biting on a handkerchief and choking back his tears.","Holding a hand to his jaw, he asked himself what should be done. The dentists who treated him were rich merchants whom one could not see at any time; one had to make an appointment. He told himself that this would never do, that he could not endure it. He decided to patronize the first one he could find, to hasten to a popular tooth-extractor, one of those iron-fisted men who, if they are ignorant of the useless art of dressing decaying teeth and of filling holes, know how to pull the stubbornest stump with an unequalled rapidity. There, the office is opened early in the morning and one is not required to wait. Seven o'clock struck at last. He hurried out, and recollecting the name of a mechanic who called himself a dentist and dwelt in the corner of a quay, he rushed through the streets, holding his cheek with his hands repressing the tears."
"Il concentrait son attention sur eux quand un autre, plus petit, parut, sordide à voir; il avait des cheveux de varech remplis de sable, deux bulles vertes au-dessous du nez, des lèvres dégoûtantes, entourées de crasse blanche par du fromage à la pie écrasé sur du pain et semé de hachures de ciboule verte.","He was concentrating his attention on them when another, smaller one appeared, squalid to see; he had kelp hair filled with sand, two green bubbles below his nose, disgusting lips, surrounded in white grime by pie crust cheese smashed on bread and strewn with hatchings of green chives.","He was fixing his attention on them when another lad appeared on the scene. He was smaller than the rest, and a really squalid specimen; his hair looked like sandy seaweed, two green bubbles hung from his nose and his lips were coated with the disgusting white mess he was eating – skim-milk cheese spread on a hunk of bread and sprinkled with chopped garlic.","He was concentrating his attention upon them when another younger, sorry little specimen appeared. He had hair like seaweed covered with sand, two green bubbles beneath his nose, and disgusting lips surrounded by a dirty white frame formed by a slice of bread smeared with cheese and filled with pieces of scallions."
"à la fin pourtant, il reprit son équilibre, il distingua nettement des oignons et des choux; plus loin, un champ de laitue et, au fond, tout le long de la haie, une série de lys blancs immobiles dans l'air lourd.","at the end, however, he regained his balance, he clearly distinguished onions and cabbage; farther on, a field of lettuce and, in the background, all along the hedge, a series of motionless white lilies in the heavy air.","In the end, however, he recovered his balance and was able to distinguish clearly onions and cabbages in front, further off a huge patch of lettuce and at the back, all along the hedge, a row of white lilies standing motionless in the sultry air.","But when he recovered his balance, he clearly distinguished the onions and cabbages, a garden bed of lettuce further off, and, in the distance along the hedge, a row of white lillies recumbent in the heavy air."
"à Paris, jadis, il avait fait composer, pour lui seul, certains volumes que des ouvriers spécialement embauchés, tiraient aux presses à bras; tantôt il recourait à Perrin de Lyon dont les sveltes et purs caractères convenaient aux réimpressions archaïques des vieux bouquins; tantôt il faisait venir d'Angleterre ou d'Amérique, pour la confection des ouvrages du présent siècle, des lettres neuves; tantôt encore il s'adressait à une maison de Lille qui possédait, depuis des siècles, tout un jeu de corps gothiques; tantôt enfin il réquisitionnait l'ancienne imprimerie Enschedé, de Haarlem, dont la fonderie conserve les poinçons et les frappes des caractères dits de civilité.","In Paris, formerly, he had had certain volumes composed, for himself alone, which specially hired workers printed on the hand presses; sometimes he had recourse to Perrin de Lyon, whose slender and pure characters suited the archaic reprints of old books; sometimes he brought from England or America, for the preparation of the works of the present century, new letters; sometimes again he addressed himself to a house in Lille which had possessed, for centuries, a whole set of Gothic bodies; sometimes finally he requisitioned the old printing works Enschedé, of Haarlem, whose foundry preserves the punches and the strikes of the so-called civility characters.","In Paris in former days, he had had certain volumes set up just for himself and printed on hand-presses by specially hired workmen. Sometimes he would commission Perrin of Lyons, whose slim, clear types were well adapted for archaic reimpressions of old texts; sometimes he would send to England or America for new characters to print works of the present century; sometimes he would apply to a house at Lille which for hundreds of years had possessed a complete fount of Gothic letters; sometimes again he would commandeer the fine old Enschedé printing-works at Haarlem, whose foundry has preserved the stamps and matrices of the so-called lettres de civilité.","Formerly in Paris he had ordered made, for himself alone, certain volumes which specially engaged mechanics printed from hand presses. Sometimes, he applied to Perrin of Lyons, whose graceful, clear type was suitable for archaic reprints of old books. At other times he dispatched orders to England or to America for the execution of modern literature and the works of the present century. Still again, he applied to a house in Lille, which for centuries had possessed a complete set of Gothic characters; he also would send requisitions to the old Enschede printing house of Haarlem whose foundry still has the stamps and dies of certain antique letters."
"Il composa ainsi le bouquet de ses fleurs: les feuilles furent serties de pierreries d'un vert accentué et précis: de chrysobéryls vert asperge; de péridots vert poireau; d'olivines vert olive et elles se détachèrent de branches en almadine et en ouwarovite d'un rouge violacé, jetant des paillettes d'un éclat sec de même que ces micas de tartre qui luisent dans l'intérieur des futailles.","He thus composed the bouquet of his flowers: the leaves were set with precious stones of an accentuated and precise green: asparagus green chrysoberyls; leek-green peridots; of olive-green olivines and they detached themselves from branches of purplish-red almadine and ouwarovite, throwing off spangles of a dry luster like those micas of tartar which gleam in the interior of the casks.","He made up his bouquet in this way: the leaves were set with gems of a strong and definite green – asparagus-green chrysoberyls, leek-green peridots, olive-green olivines – and these sprang from twigs of almandine and uvarovite of a purplish red, which threw out flashes of harsh, brilliant light like the scales of tartar that glitter on the insides of wine-casks.","This is how he composed his bouquet of flowers: the leaves were set with jewels of a pronounced, distinct green; the chrysoberyls of asparagus green; the chrysolites of leek green; the olivines of olive green. They hung from branches of almandine and ouwarovite of a violet red, darting spangles of a hard brilliance like tartar micas gleaming through forest depths."
"Sa corruption charmante correspondait fatalement aux penchants de des Esseintes qui, par les jours de brume, par les jours de pluie, s'enfermait dans le retrait imaginé par ce poète et se grisait les yeux avec les chatoiements de ses étoffes, avec les incandescences de ses pierres, avec ses somptuosités, exclusivement matérielles, qui concouraient aux incitations cérébrales et montaient comme une poudre de cantharide dans un nuage de tiède encens vers une Idole Bruxelloise, au visage fardé, au ventre tanné par des parfums.","Its charming corruption inevitably corresponded to the inclinations of des Esseintes who, on foggy days, on rainy days, shut himself up in the withdrawal imagined by this poet and intoxicated his eyes with the shimmering of his fabrics, with the incandescences of its stones, with their sumptuousness, exclusively material, which contributed to cerebral incitements and rose like cantharide powder in a cloud of warm incense towards a Brussels Idol, with a painted face, a belly tanned by perfumes.","His delightful corruptness corresponded with Des Esseintes’s tastes, and when it was foggy or raining the latter would often shut himself up in the retreat imagined by this poet and intoxicate his eyes with the shimmer of his fabrics, with the sparkle of his jewels, with all his exclusively material luxuries, which helped to excite his brain and rose like cantharides in a cloud of warm incense towards a Brussels idol with a painted face and a belly tanned with perfumes.","His charming corruption fatally corresponded to the tendencies of Des Esseintes who, on misty or rainy days, enclosed himself in the retreat fancied by the poet and intoxicated his eyes with the rustlings of his fabrics, with the incandescence of his stones, with his exclusively material sumptuousness which ministered to cerebral reactions, and rose like a cantharides powder in a cloud of fragrant incense toward a Brussel idol with painted face and belly stained by the perfumes."
"Peu à peu enfin, ces arguties s'évanouirent. Il vit, en quelque sorte, du haut de son esprit, le panorama de l'église, son influence héréditaire sur l'humanité, depuis des siècles; il se la représenta, désolée et grandiose, énonçant à l'homme, l'horreur de la vie, l'inclémence de la destinée, prêchant la patience, la contrition, l'esprit de sacrifice; tâchant de panser les plaies, en montrant les blessures saignantes du Christ; assurant des privilèges divins, promettant la meilleure part du paradis aux affligés; exhortant la créature humaine à souffrir; à présenter à Dieu, comme un holocauste, ses tribulations et ses offenses, ses vicissitudes et ses peines. Elle devenait véritablement éloquente, maternelle aux misérables, pitoyable aux opprimés, menaçante pour les oppresseurs et les despotes.","Finally, little by little, these quibbles faded away. He saw, in a way, from the top of his mind, the panorama of the church, its hereditary influence on humanity, for centuries; he pictured it to himself, desolate and grandiose, telling man the horror of life, the inclemency of destiny, preaching patience, contrition, the spirit of sacrifice; trying to heal the wounds, showing the bleeding wounds of Christ; assuring divine privileges, promising the best part of paradise to the afflicted; urging the human creature to suffer; to present to God, as a holocaust, its tribulations and its offenses, its vicissitudes and its sorrows. She became truly eloquent, maternal to the wretched, pitiful to the oppressed, threatening to oppressors and despots.","Eventually, little by little, this casuistic spirit left him. He then looked out, as it were, from the summit of his mind, over the panorama of the Church and her hereditary influence on humanity down the ages; he pictured her to himself in all her melancholy grandeur, proclaiming to mankind the horror of life, the inclemency of fate; preaching patience, contrition, the spirit of self-sacrifice; endeavouring to salve the sores of men by pointing to the bleeding wounds of Christ; guaranteeing divine privileges and promising the better part of paradise to the afflicted; exhorting the human creature to suffer, to offer to God as a holocaust his tribulations and his offences, his vicissitudes and his sorrows. He saw her become truly eloquent, speaking words full of sympathy for the poor, full of pity for the oppressed, full of menace for tyrants and oppressors.","Little by little this tendency to ineffectual quibbling disappeared. In his mind's eye he saw the panorama of the Church with its hereditary influence on humanity through the centuries. He imagined it as imposing and suffering, emphasizing to man the horror of life, the infelicity of man's destiny; preaching patience, penitence and the spirit of sacrifice; seeking to heal wounds, while it displayed the bleeding wounds of Christ; bespeaking divine privileges; promising the richest part of paradise to the afflicted; exhorting humanity to suffer and to render to God, like a holocaust, its trials and offenses, its vicissitudes and pains. Thus the Church grew truly eloquent, the beneficent mother of the oppressed, the eternal menace of oppressors and despots."

"Enfin, sur la cheminée dont la robe fut, elle aussi, découpée dans la somptueuse étoffe d'une dalmatique florentine, entre deux ostensoirs, en cuivre doré, de style byzantin, provenant de l'ancienne Abbaye-au-Bois de Bièvre, un merveilleux canon d'église, aux trois compartiments séparés, ouvragés comme une dentelle, contint, sous le verre de son cadre, copiées sur un authentique vélin, avec d'admirables lettres de missel et de splendides enluminures: trois pièces de Baudelaire: à droite et à gauche, les sonnets portant ces titres ""la Mort des Amants"" - ""l'Ennemi""; - au milieu, le poème en prose intitulé: ""Any where out of the world. - N'importe où, hors du monde"".","Finally, on the fireplace, whose dress was also cut from the sumptuous fabric of a Florentine dalmatic, between two monstrances, in gilded copper, in the Byzantine style, from the former Abbaye-au-Bois de Bièvre, a wonderful church canon, with three separate compartments, worked like lace, contained, under the glass of its frame, copied on an authentic vellum, with admirable missal letters and splendid illuminations: three pieces by Baudelaire: on the right and on the left, the sonnets bearing these titles ""the Death of the Lovers"" - ""the Enemy""; - in the middle, the prose poem entitled: ""Any where out of the world. - Anywhere, out of the world"".","As a finishing touch, in the centre of the chimney-piece, which was likewise dressed in sumptuous silk from a Florentine dalmatic, and flanked by two Byzantine monstrances of gilded copper which had originally come from the Abbaye-au-Bois at Bièvre, there stood a magnificent triptych whose separate panels had been fashioned to resemble lace-work. This now contained, framed under glass, copied on real vellum in exquisite missal lettering and marvellously illuminated, three pieces by Baudelaire: on the right and left, the sonnets La Mort des amants and L’Ennemi, and in the middle, the prose poem bearing the English title Anywhere out of the World.6","The mantel shelf was sumptuously draped with the remnant of a Florentine dalmatica.

"En de magnifiques pages il avait exposé ces amours hybrides, exaspérées par l'impuissance où elles sont de se combler, ces dangereux mensonges des stupéfiants et des toxiques appelés à l'aide pour endormir la souffrance et mater l'ennui. à une époque où la littérature attribuait presque exclusivement la douleur de vivre aux malchances d'un amour méconnu ou aux jalousies de l'adultère, il avait négligé ces maladies infantiles et sondé ces plaies plus incurables, plus vivaces, plus profondes, qui sont creusées par la satiété, la désillusion, le mépris, dans les âmes en ruine que le présent torture, que le passé répugne, que l'avenir effraye et désespère.","In magnificent pages he had exposed these hybrid loves, exasperated by the impotence in which they are to fulfill themselves, these dangerous lies of narcotics and poisons called for help to lull suffering and quell boredom. at a time when literature attributed the pain of living almost exclusively to the misfortunes of an unrecognized love or to the jealousies of adultery, he had neglected these infantile diseases and probed these more incurable, more perennial, deeper wounds, which are dug by satiety, disillusion, contempt, in souls in ruins whom the present tortures, the past repels, the future frightens and despairs.","In a succession of magnificent pages he had exposed these hybrid passions, exacerbated by the impossibility of obtaining complete satisfaction, as well as the dangerous subterfuges of narcotic and toxic drugs, taken in the hope of deadening pain and conquering boredom. In a period when literature attributed man’s unhappiness almost exclusively to the misfortunes of unrequited love or the jealousies engendered by adulterous love, he had ignored these childish ailments and sounded instead those deeper, deadlier, longer-lasting wounds that are inflicted by satiety, disillusion and contempt upon souls tortured by the present, disgusted by the past, terrified and dismayed by the future.","In magnificent pages he exposed his hybrid loves who were exasperated by the impotence in which they were overwhelmed, the hazardous deceits of narcotics and poisons invoked to aid in calming suffering and conquering ennui. At an epoch when literature attributed unhappiness of life almost exclusively to the mischances of unrequited love or to the jealousies that attend adulterous love, he disregarded such puerile maladies and probed into those wounds which are more fatal, more keen and deep, which arise from satiety, disillusion and scorn in ruined souls whom the present tortures, the past fills with loathing and the future frightens and menaces with despair."
Il se retrempa dans ce bain de l'habitude auquel d'artificiels regrets insinuaient une qualité plus roborative et plus tonique.,He soaked himself again in this bath of habit to which artificial regrets insinuated a more invigorating and invigorating quality.,"He steeped himself once more in this refreshing bath of settled habits, to which artificial regrets added a more bracing and more tonic quality.","He steeped himself in this bath of habitude, to which artificial regrets insinuated a tonic quality."
"Cette nouvelle mettait aussi en jeu les opérations de la volonté, mais elle ne traitait plus de ses affaiblissements et de ses défaites, sous l'effet de la peur; elle étudiait, au contraire, ses exaltations, sous l'impulsion d'une conviction tournée à l'idée fixe; elle démontrait sa puissance qui parvenait même à saturer l'atmosphère, à imposer sa foi aux choses ambiantes.","This story also brought into play the operations of the will, but it no longer dealt with its weakenings and its defeats, under the effect of fear; she studied, on the contrary, her exaltations, under the impulse of a conviction turned into a fixed idea; she demonstrated her power which even managed to saturate the atmosphere, to impose her faith on surrounding things.","This story too brought into play the operations of the will, but it no longer showed it undermined and brought low by fear; on the contrary, it studied its intoxication under the influence of a conviction which had become an obsession, and it also demonstrated its power, which was so great that it could saturate the atmosphere and impose its beliefs on surrounding objects.","This story also put in play the operations of the will, but it no longer treated of its defeats and helplessness under the effects of fear; on the contrary, it studied the exaltations of the will under the impulse of a fixed idea; it demonstrated its power which often succeeded in saturating the atmosphere and in imposing its qualities on surrounding objects."
"Cela devenait une littérature condensée, un coulis essentiel, un sublimé d'art; cette tactique d'abord employée d'une façon restreinte, dans ses première oeuvres, Mallarmé l'avait hardiment arborée dans une pièce sur Théophile Gautier et dans L'Après-midi du faune, une églogue, où les subtilités des joies sensuelles se déroulaient en des vers mystérieux et câlins que trouait tout à coup ce cri fauve et délirant du faune: ""Alors m'éveillerai-je à la ferveur première, ""Droit et seul sous un flot antique de lumière, ""Lys! et l'un de vous tous pour l'ingénuité.","It became a condensed literature, an essential coulis, a sublimation of art; this tactic first employed in a restrained way, in his first works, Mallarmé had boldly displayed it in a play on Théophile Gautier and in L'Après-midi du faune, an eclogue, where the subtleties of sensual joys unfolded into mysterious and cuddly verses suddenly pierced by that tawny and delirious cry of the faun: ""So will I awaken to the first fervor, ""Upright and alone under an ancient flood of light, ""Lily! and one of all of you for ingenuity.","The result was a wonderfully condensed style, an essence of literature, a sublimate of art. It was a style that Mallarmé had first employed only sparingly in his earliest works, and then used openly and audaciously in a piece he wrote on Théophile Gautier and in L’Après-midi d’un faune, an eclogue in which the subtleties of sensual pleasure were unfolded in mysterious, tender verse, suddenly interrupted by this bestial, frenzied cry of the faun: Alors m’éveillerai-je à la ferveur première, Droit et seul sous un flot antique de lumière, Lys! et l’un de vous tous pour l’ingénuité.18","It became a concentrated literature, an essential unity, a sublimate of art. This style was at first employed with restraint in his earlier works, but Mallarmé had boldly proclaimed it in a verse on Théophile Gautier and in l'Après-midi du faune, an eclogue where the subtleties of sensual joys are described in mysterious and caressing verses suddenly pierced by this wild, rending faun cry: Alors m'éveillerai-je à la ferveur première, Droit et seul sous un flot antique de lumière, Lys! et l'un de vous tous pour l'ingénuité."
"Par suite de la manipulation rapide de la fécule et de la belle apparence que présentaient les pains azymes créés avec cette matière, cette indigne fourberie s'était tellement propagée que le mystère de la transsubstantiation n'existait presque jamais plus et que les prêtres et les fidèles communiaient, sans le savoir, avec des espèces neutres.","As a result of the rapid handling of the starch and the beautiful appearance presented by the unleavened breads created with this material, this unworthy trickery had spread to such an extent that the mystery of transubstantiation hardly ever existed anymore and that the priests and faithful communed, without knowing it, with neutral species.","Because of the easy manipulation of this flour and the attractive appearance of the wafers made with it, this outrageous swindle had become so common that the mystery of transubstantiation scarcely existed any longer and both priests and faithful communicated, all unwittingly, with neutral species.","By means of the rapid manipulation of the fecula and the beautiful appearance presented by the unleavened breads created with this element, the shameless imposture had been so propagated that now the mystery of the transubstantiation hardly existed any longer and the priests and faithful were holding communion, without being aware of it, with neutral elements."
"Les domestiques étaient ennuyés et vieux. L'enfant, abandonné à lui-même, fouillait dans les livres, les jours de pluie ; errait, par les après-midi de beau temps, dans la campagne.","The servants were bored and old. The child, left to himself, rummaged through the books on rainy days; wandered on sunny afternoons in the countryside.","The servants were old and tired, and the boy was left to his own devices. On rainy days he used to browse through the books in the library, and when it was fine he would spend the afternoon exploring the local countryside.","The servants were old and dull. Left to himself, the boy delved into books on rainy days and roamed about the countryside on pleasant afternoons."
"Il s'estimait, en somme, dégagé de tout lien, de toute contrainte; il avait simplement gardé, contrairement à tous les gens élevés dans les lycées ou les pensions laïques, un excellent souvenir de son collège et de ses maîtres, et voilà que maintenant, il se consultait, en arrivait à se demander si les semences tombées jusqu'à ce jour dans un sol stérile, ne commençaient pas à poindre.","He considered himself, in short, freed from all ties, from all constraint; he had simply kept, contrary to all the people raised in secular high schools or boarding houses, an excellent memory of his college and his masters, and now he was consulting himself, coming to wonder if the seeds had fallen until to this day in barren soil, did not begin to emerge.","He considered, in fact, that he had shaken off all his old ties and fetters, and that he differed from the products of lycées and lay boarding-schools in only one respect, namely that he retained pleasant memories of his school and his schoolmasters. And yet, now that he examined his conscience, he began to wonder whether the seed which had fallen on apparently barren ground was not showing signs of germinating.","He had deemed himself free of all bonds and constraints. Unlike most graduates of lycées or private schools, he had preserved a vivid memory of his college and of his masters. And now, as he considered these matters, he asked himself if the seeds sown until now on barren soil were not beginning to take root."

"Le lapidaire prenait note à mesure des endroits où devaient être incrustées les pierres. Et la bordure de la carapace, dit-il à des Esseintes?","The lapidary took note as and when of the places where the stones were to be inlaid. And the edge of the carapace, he said to Des Esseintes?",The lapidary took careful notes as it was explained to him exactly where each stone was to be let in. ‘What about the edging of the shell?’ he then asked Des Esseintes.,The lapidary made a note of the places where the stones were to be inlaid. “And the border of the shell?” he asked Des Esseintes.
"Ils arrivaient ainsi à prendre sur l'enfant un réel ascendant, à pétrir, dans une certaine mesure, les intelligences qu'ils cultivaient, à les diriger, dans un sens, à les greffer d'idées spéciales, à assurer la croissance de leurs pensées par une méthode insinuante et pateline qu'ils continuaient, en s'efforçant de les suivre dans la vie, de les soutenir dans leur carrière, en leur adressant ces lettres affectueuses comme le dominicain Lacordaire savait en écrire à ses anciens élèves de Sorrèze.","They thus managed to gain a real ascendancy over the child, to knead, to a certain extent, the intelligences they were cultivating, to direct them, in a sense, to graft them with special ideas, to ensure the growth of their thoughts by an insinuating and paternal method which they continued, endeavoring to follow them in life, to support them in their careers, by addressing them those affectionate letters as the Dominican Lacordaire knew how to write to his former pupils of Sorrèze.","In this way the Fathers managed to gain a real hold upon their pupils, to mould to some extent the minds they cultivated, to guide them in certain specific directions, to inculcate particular notions and to ensure the desired development of their ideas by means of an insinuating, ingratiating technique which they continued to apply in after-years, doing their best to keep track of their charges in adult life, backing them up in their careers and writing them affectionate letters such as the Dominican Lacordaire wrote to his former pupils at Sorrèze.1","It was a paternal discipline whose success lay in the fact that they did not seek to domineer over the pupils, that they gossiped with them, treating them as men while showering them with the attentions paid a spoiled child. In this manner, the monks succeeded in assuming a real influence over the youngsters; in molding, to some extent, the minds which they were cultivating; in directing them, in a sense; in instilling special ideas; in assuring the growth of their thoughts by insinuating, wheedling methods with which they continued to flatter them throughout their careers, taking pains not to lose sight of them in their later life, and by sending them affectionate letters like those which the Dominican Lacordaire so skillfully wrote to his former pupils of Sorrèze."
"Ces cauchemars se renouvelèrent; il craignit de s'endormir. Il resta, étendu sur son lit, des heures entières, tantôt dans de persistantes insomnies et de fiévreuses agitations, tantôt dans d'abominables rêves que rompaient des sursauts d'homme perdant pied, dégringolant du haut en bas d'un escalier, dévalant, sans pouvoir se retenir, au fond d'un gouffre.","These nightmares were renewed; he was afraid of falling asleep. He remained, stretched out on his bed, for whole hours, sometimes in persistent insomnia and feverish agitations, sometimes in abominable dreams which were broken by the bursts of a man losing his footing, tumbling from top to bottom of a staircase, tumbling down, without being able to hold back, at the bottom of an abyss.","These nightmares recurred again and again, until he was afraid to go to sleep. He spent hours lying on his bed, sometimes the victim of persistent insomnia and feverish restlessness, at other times a prey to abominable dreams that were interrupted only when the dreamer was shocked into wakefulness by losing his footing, falling all the way downstairs or plunging helplessly into the depths of an abyss.","These nightmares attacked him repeatedly. He was afraid to fall asleep. For hours he remained stretched on his bed, now a prey to feverish and agitated wakefulness, now in the grip of oppressive dreams in which he tumbled down flights of stairs and felt himself sinking, powerless, into abysmal depths."
"En se sondant bien, néanmoins, il comprenait d'abord que, pour l'attirer, une oeuvre devait revêtir ce caractère d'étrangeté que réclamait Edgar Poe, mais il s'aventurait volontiers plus loin, sur cette route et appelait des flores byzantines de cervelle et des déliquescences compliquées de langue; il souhaitait une indécision troublante sur laquelle il pût rêver, jusqu'à ce qu'il la fit, à sa volonté, plus vague ou plus ferme selon l'état momentané de son âme. Il voulait, en somme, une oeuvre d'art et pour ce qu'elle était par elle-même et pour ce qu'elle pouvait permettre de lui prêter, il voulait aller avec elle, grâce à elle, comme soutenu par un adjuvant, comme porté par un véhicule, dans une sphère où les sensations sublimées lui imprimeraient une commotion inattendue et dont il chercherait longtemps et même vainement à analyser les causes.","By probing himself well, however, he first understood that, to attract him, a work had to take on this character of strangeness that Edgar Poe demanded, but he willingly ventured further, on this road and called Byzantine floras of brain and complicated deliquescences of tongue; he wanted a disturbing indecision on which he could dream, until he made it, at his will, more vague or firmer according to the momentary state of his soul. He wanted, in short, a work of art and for what it was by itself and for what it could afford to lend to it, he wanted to go with it, thanks to it, as if supported by an adjuvant, as if carried by a vehicle, in a sphere where the sublimated sensations would give him an unexpected commotion and the causes of which he would long and even vainly seek to analyze.","By diligent self-examination, however, he realized first of all that to attract him a book had to have that quality of strangeness that Edgar Allan Poe called for; but he was inclined to venture further along this road, and to insist on Byzantine flowers of thought and deliquescent complexities of style; he demanded a disquieting vagueness that would give him scope for dreaming until he decided to make it still vaguer or more definite, according to the way he felt at the time. He wanted, in short, a work of art both for what it was in itself and for what it allowed him to bestow on it; he wanted to go along with it and on it, as if supported by a friend or carried by a vehicle, into a sphere where sublimated sensations would arouse within him an unexpected commotion, the causes of which he would strive patiently and even vainly to analyse.","Yet when he probed himself he understood that to attract, a work must have that character of strangeness demanded by Edgar Allen Poe; but he ventured even further on this path and called for Byzantine flora of brain and complicated deliquescences of language. He desired a troubled indecision on which he might brood until he could shape it at will to a more vague or determinate form, according to the momentary state of his soul. In short, he desired a work of art both for what it was in itself and for what it permitted him to endow it. He wished to pass by means of it into a sphere of sublimated sensation which would arouse in him new commotions whose cause he might long and vainly seek to analyze."

"Comme il le disait, la nature a fait son temps; elle a définitivement lassé, par la dégoûtante uniformité de ses paysages et de ses ciels, l'attentive patience des raffinés. Au fond, quelle platitude de spécialiste confinée dans sa partie, quelle petitesse de boutiquière tenant tel article à l'exclusion de tout autre, quel monotone magasin de prairies et d'arbres, quelle banale agence de montagnes et de mers!","As he said, nature has had its day; it has definitely weary, by the disgusting uniformity of its landscapes and its skies, the attentive patience of the refined. Basically, what platitude of a specialist confined to his part, what smallness of a shopkeeper holding such an article to the exclusion of all others, what a monotonous store of meadows and trees, what a banal arrangement of mountains and seas!","Nature, he used to say, has had her day; she has finally and utterly exhausted the patience of sensitive observers by the revolting uniformity of her landscapes and skyscapes. After all, what platitudinous limitations she imposes, like a tradesman specializing in a single line of business; what petty-minded restrictions, like a shopkeeper stocking one article to the exclusion of all others; what a monotonous store of meadows and trees, what a commonplace display of mountains and seas!","Nature had had her day, as he put it. By the disgusting sameness of her landscapes and skies, she had once for all wearied the considerate patience of æsthetes. Really, what dullness! the dullness of the specialist confined to his narrow work. What manners! the manners of the tradesman offering one particular ware to the exclusion of all others. What a monotonous storehouse of fields and trees! What a banal agency of mountains and seas!"
"Mais sa personnalité résidait surtout en ceci: qu'il avait pu exprimer de vagues et délicieuses confidences, à mi-voix, au crépuscule. Seul, il avait pu laisser deviner certains au-delà troublants d'âme, des chuchotements si bas de pensées, des aveux si murmurés, si interrompus, que l'oreille qui les percevait, demeurait hésitante, coulant à l'âme des langueurs avivées par le mystère de ce souffle plus deviné que senti. Tout l'accent de Verlaine était dans ces adorables vers des Fêtes galantes: Le soir tombait, un soir équivoque d'automne, Les belles se pendant rêveuses à nos bras, Dirent alors des mots si spécieux tout bas, Que notre âme depuis ce temps tremble et s'étonne.","But his personality resided above all in this: that he had been able to express vague and delicious confidences, in a low voice, at dusk. Alone, he had been able to hint at certain troubling beyonds of the soul, whisperings of thoughts so low, confessions so murmured, so interrupted, that the ear which perceived them remained hesitant, flowing to the soul of sharpened languor. by the mystery of this breath more divined than felt. All Verlaine's accent was in these adorable verses of the Fêtes galantes: Evening was falling, an equivocal autumn evening, The beauties hanging dreamily in our arms, Then said such specious words in a low voice, That our soul since that time trembles and wonders.","But his originality lay above all in his ability to communicate deliciously vague confidences in a whisper in the twilight. He alone had possessed the secret of hinting at certain strange spiritual aspirations, of whispering certain thoughts, of murmuring certain confessions, so softly, so quietly, so haltingly that the ear that caught them was left hesitating, and passed on to the soul a languor made more pronounced by the vagueness of these words that were guessed at rather than heard. The essence of Verlaine’s poetry could be found in those wonderful lines from his Fêtes galantes: Le soir tombait, un soir équivoque d’automne: Les belles se pendant rêveuses à nos bras, Dirent alors des mots","But his personality expressed itself most of all in vague and delicious confidences breathed in hushed accents, in the twilight. He alone had been able to reveal the troubled Ultima Thules of the soul; low whisperings of thoughts, avowals so haltingly and murmuringly confessed that the ear which hears them remains hesitant, passing on to the soul languors quickened by the mystery of this suggestion which is divined rather than felt. Everything characteristic of Verlaine was expressed in these adorable verses of the Fêtes Galantes: Le soir tombait, un soir équivoque d'automne, Les belles se pendant rêveuses à nos bras, Dirent alors des mots si spécieux tout bas, Que notre âme depuis ce temps tremble et s'étonne"
"La saphirine qui allume des feux bleuâtres de phosphore sur un fond de chocolat, brun sourd.","The sapphirine that lights bluish phosphorus fires on a chocolate, dull brown background.","For this purpose he used only Ceylon cat’s-eyes, cymophanes and sapphirines – three stones which all sparkled with mysterious, deceptive flashes, painfully drawn from the icy depths of their turbid water: the cat’s-eye of a greenish grey streaked with concentric veins which seem to shift and change position according to the way the light falls; the cymophane with blue waterings rippling across the floating, milky-coloured centre; the sapphirine which kindles bluish, phosphorescent fires against a dull, chocolate-brown background.","The blue chalcedony which kindles with bluish phosphorescent fires against a dead brown, chocolate background."
"Tout cela s'agitait sur des rives, dans des entrepôts gigantesques, baignés par l'eau teigneuse et sourde d'une imaginaire Tamise, dans une futaie de mâts, dans une forêt de poutres crevant les nuées blafardes du firmament, pendant que des trains filaient, à toute vapeur, dans le ciel, que d'autres roulaient dans les égouts, éructant des cris affreux, vomissant des flots de fumée par des bouches de puits, que par tous les boulevards, par toutes les rues, où éclataient, dans un éternel crépuscule, les monstrueuses et voyantes infamies de la réclame, des flots de voitures coulaient, entre des colonnes de gens, silencieux, affairés, les yeux en avant, les coudes au corps.","All this bustled about on the banks, in gigantic warehouses, bathed in the nasty, dull water of an imaginary Thames, in a thicket of masts, in a forest of beams bursting through the pale clouds of the firmament, while trains spun, at full steam, in the sky, that others rolled in the sewers, belching frightful cries, vomiting billows of smoke through the mouths of wells, than through all the boulevards, through all the streets, where burst, in an eternal twilight, the monstrous and conspicuous infamies of advertising, streams of cars flowed between columns of people, silent, busy, eyes forward, elbows to their bodies.","All this activity was going on in warehouses and on wharves washed by the dark, slimy waters of an imaginary Thames, in the midst of a forest of masts, a tangle of beams and girders piercing the pale, lowering clouds. Up above, trains raced by at full speed; and down in the underground sewers, others rumbled along, occasionally emitting ghastly screams or vomiting floods of smoke through the gaping mouths of air-shafts. And meanwhile, along every street, big or small, in an eternal twilight relieved only by the glaring infamies of modern advertising, there flowed an endless stream of traffic between two columns of earnest, silent Londoners, marching along with eyes fixed ahead and elbows glued to their sides.","All this was transpiring in vast warehouses along the river banks which were bathed by the muddy and dull water of an imaginary Thames, in a forest of masts and girders piercing the wan clouds of the firmament, while trains rushed past at full speed or rumpled underground uttering horrible cries and vomiting waves of smoke, and while, through every street, monstrous and gaudy and infamous advertisements flared through the eternal twilight, and strings of carriages passed between rows of preoccupied and taciturn people whose eyes stared ahead and whose elbows pressed closely against their bodies."
"Dans le monde où il avait vécu, avant son départ pour Fontenay? - Mais la plupart des hobereaux qu'il avait fréquentés, avaient dû, depuis cette époque, se déprimer davantage dans les salons, s'abêtir devant les tables de jeux, s'achever dans les lèvres des filles; la plupart même devaient s'être mariés; après avoir eu, leur vie durant, les restants des voyous, c'était leurs femmes qui possédaient maintenant les restes des voyoutes, car, maître des prémices, le peuple était le seul qui n'eût pas du rebut!","In the world where he had lived before his departure for Fontenay? - But most of the squires he had frequented had, since that time, been more depressed in the salons, stupefied in front of the gaming tables, ended in the lips of girls; the majority even must have been married; after having had, during their life, the remnants of the hoodlums, it was their wives who now possessed the remains of the hoodlums, for, master of the firstfruits, the people were the only ones who had no scrap!","In the society he had frequented before his departure for Fontenay? – But most of the squireens he had known in those days must since have reached new depths of boredom in the drawing-room, of stupidity at the gaming table and of depravity in the brothel. Most of them, too, must have got married; after treating themselves all their lives to the leavings of street-arabs, they now treated their wives to the leavings of street-walkers, for like a master of the first-fruits, the working class was the only one that did not feed on left-overs!","In the world where he had dwelt before his departure for Fontenay? But most of the county squires he had associated with must since have stultified themselves near card tables or ended upon the lips of women; most by this time must have married; after having enjoyed, during their life, the spoils of cads, their spouses now possessed the remains of strumpets, for, master of first-fruits, the people alone waste nothing."
"Sur ces entrefaites, le son argentin d'une cloche qui tintait un petit angélus, annonça à des Esseintes que le déjeuner était prêt. Il laissa là ses livres, s'essuya le front et se dirigea vers la salle à manger, se disant que, parmi tous ces volumes qu'il venait de ranger, les oeuvres de Barbey d'Aurevilly étaient encore les seules dont les idées et le style présentassent ces faisandages, ces taches morbides, ces épidermes talés et ce goût blet, qu'il aimait tant à savourer parmi les écrivains décadents, latins et monastiques des vieux âges.","Meanwhile, the silvery sound of a bell ringing a little Angelus announced to Des Esseintes that breakfast was ready. He left his books there, wiped his brow and headed for the dining room, saying to himself that, among all the volumes he had just put away, the works of Barbey d'Aurevilly were still the only ones whose ideas and his style presented those wilting, those morbid stains, those tarnished epidermis, and that bland taste, which he was so fond of savoring among the decadent, Latin, and monastic writers of old ages.","Des Esseintes’s musings had reached this point when the silvery sound of a bell tinkling a little angelus told him that breakfast was ready. He left his books where they were, wiped his forehead and made for the dining-room, telling himself that of all the volumes he had been rearranging, the works of Barbey d’Aurevilly were still the only ones whose thought and style offered those gamey flavours and unhealthy spots, that bruised skin and sleepy taste which he so loved to savour in the decadent writers, both Latin and monastic, of olden times.","Meanwhile the silvery sound of a clock that tolled the angelus announced breakfast time to Des Esseintes. He abandoned his books, pressed his brow and went to the dining room, saying to himself that, among all the volumes he had just arranged, the works of Barbey d'Aurevilly were the only ones whose ideas and style offered the gaminess he so loved to savor in the Latin and decadent, monastic writers of past ages."
"Un matin, tandis qu'il contemplait ses murs orange et bleu, songeant à d'idéales tentures fabriquées avec des étoles de l'église grecque, rêvant à des dalmatiques russes d'orfroi, à des chapes en brocart, ramagées de lettres slavones figurées par des pierres de l'Oural et des rangs de perles, le médecin entra et, observant les regards de son malade, l'interrogea.","One morning, as he gazed at its orange and blue walls, thinking of ideal hangings made with stoles from the Greek church, dreaming of Russian orfrey dalmatics, of brocaded copes, spangled with Slavonic letters figuring By stones from the Urals and rows of pearls, the doctor entered and, observing the eyes of his patient, questioned him.","One morning, as he was looking at his blue and orange walls, dreaming of ideal hangings made of stoles designed for the Greek Church, of gold-fringed Russian dalmatics, of brocaded copes inscribed with Slavonic lettering in pearls or in precious stones from the Urals, the doctor came in and, following the direction of his patient’s gaze, asked him what he was thinking.","One morning, while contemplating his orange and blue walls, considering some ideal tapestries worked with stoles of the Greek Church, dreaming of Russian orphrey dalmaticas and brocaded copes flowered with Slavonic letters done in Ural stones and rows of pearls, the physician entered and, noticing the patient's eyes, questioned him."
"Il y avait dans ses oeuvres désespérées et érudites un enchantement singulier, une incantation vous remuant jusqu'au fond des entrailles, comme celle de certains poèmes de Baudelaire, et l'on demeurait ébahi, songeur, déconcerté, par cet art qui franchissait les limites de la peinture, empruntait à l'art d'écrire ses plus subtiles évocations, à l'art du Limosin ses plus merveilleux éclats, à l'art du lapidaire et du graveur ses finesses les plus exquises. Ces deux images de la Salomé, pour lesquelles l'admiration de des Esseintes était sans borne, vivaient, sous ses yeux, pendues aux murailles de son cabinet de travail, sur des panneaux réservés entre les rayons des livres.","There was in his desperate and erudite works a singular enchantment, an incantation moving you to the bottom of the entrails, like that of certain poems of Baudelaire, and one remained amazed, pensive, disconcerted, by this art which crossed the limits of painting, borrowed from the art of writing its most subtle evocations, from the art of Limosin its most marvelous brilliance, from the art of the lapidary and the engraver its most exquisite finesse. These two images of Salome, for which Des Esseintes' admiration was boundless, lived before his eyes, hung on the walls of his study, on reserved panels between the shelves of books.","His sad and scholarly works breathed a strange magic, an incantatory charm which stirred you to the depths of your being like the sorcery of certain of Baudelaire’s poems, so that you were left amazed and pensive, disconcerted by this art which crossed the frontiers of painting to borrow from the writer’s art its most subtly evocative suggestions, from the enameller’s art its most wonderfully brilliant effects, from the lapidary’s and etcher’s art its most exquisitely delicate touches. These two pictures of Salome, for which Des Esseintes’ admiration knew no bounds, lived constantly before his eyes, hung as they were on the walls of his study, on panels reserved for them between the bookcases.","His depressing and erudite productions possessed a strange enchantment, an incantation that stirred one to the depths, just as do certain poems of Baudelaire, caused one to pause disconcerted, amazed, brooding on the spell of an art which leaped beyond the confines of painting, borrowing its most subtle effects from the art of writing, its most marvelous stokes from the art of Limosin, its most exquisite refinements from the art of the lapidary and the engraver.

"Cet échange de sexe entre miss Urania et lui, l'avait exalté; nous sommes voués l'un à l'autre, assurait-il; à cette subite admiration de la force brutale jusqu'alors exécrée, se joignit enfin l'exorbitant attrait de la boue, de la basse prostitution heureuse de payer cher les tendresses malotrues d'un souteneur.","This exchange of sex between Miss Urania and himself had excited him; we are dedicated to each other, he assured us; to this sudden admiration of brute force hitherto execrated, was finally joined the exorbitant attraction of the mud, of base prostitution happy to pay dearly for the clumsy tenderness of a pimp.","This exchange of sex between Miss Urania and himself had excited him tremendously. The two of them, so he said, were made for each other; and added to this sudden admiration for brute strength, a thing he had hitherto detested, there was also that extravagant delight in self-abasement which a common prostitute shows in paying dearly for the loutish caresses of a pimp.","Compared with her, Des Esseintes seemed to himself a frail, effeminate creature, and he began to desire her as ardently as an anæmic young girl might desire some loutish Hercules whose arms could crush her in a strong embrace."
"Il avait acheté cet instrument en cuivre gravé et doré, d'origine allemande et datant du XVIIe siècle, chez un brocanteur de Paris, après une visite au Musée de Cluny, où longuement il s'était pâmé devant un merveilleux astrolabe, en ivoire ciselé, dont l'allure cabalistique l'avait ravi.","He had bought this engraved and gilded copper instrument, of German origin and dating from the 17th century, from a second-hand dealer in Paris, after a visit to the Cluny Museum, where he had long swooned in front of a marvelous astrolabe, in chiseled ivory , whose cabalistic allure had delighted him.","He had bought this instrument, which was made of engraved and gilded copper, of German workmanship and dating from the seventeenth century, in a second-hand dealer’s in Paris, after a visit he had paid to the Cluny Museum, where he had stood for hours enraptured by a wonderful astrolabe of carved ivory, whose cabbalistic appearance had captivated him.","He had purchased this engraved and gilded copper instrument (it had come from Germany and dated from the seventeenth century) of a second-hand Paris dealer, after a visit to the Cluny Museum, where he had stood for a long while in ecstatic admiration before a marvelous astrolabe made of chiseled ivory, whose cabalistic appearance enchanted him."
"Des Esseintes ne pouvait s'empêcher de hausser les épaules devant ces malheureuses opinions que recouvrait une prose assistée, dont l'étoffe déjà portée, s'accrochait et se déchirait, à chaque coin de phrases.","Des Esseintes could not help shrugging his shoulders at these unfortunate opinions covered up by assisted prose, the stuff of which, already worn, clung and tore at each corner of the sentences.","Des Esseintes could not help shrugging his shoulders over these unfortunate opinions, wrapped up in a dowdy prose-style, the well-worn material of which caught and tore on the corner of every sentence.","Des Esseintes could not restrain a shrug of the shoulders before these stupid opinions, covered by a borrowed prose whose already worn texture clung or became torn at each phrase."
"Il n'eut pas le temps de répondre, car déjà la femme changeait; des couleurs flamboyantes passaient dans ses prunelles; ses lèvres se teignaient du rouge furieux des Anthurium, les boutons de ses seins éclataient, vernis tels que deux gousses de piment rouge.","He didn't have time to answer, for the woman was already changing; flamboyant colors flashed through his eyes; her lips were tinged with the furious red of Anthuriums, the pimples on her breasts burst, varnished like two pods of red pepper.","He had no time to answer, for already the woman was changing; glowing colours lit up her eyes; her lips took on the fierce red of the Anthuriums; the nipples of her bosom shone as brightly as two red peppers.","He had no time to answer, for already the woman was changing. Flamboyant colors passed and repassed in her eyes. Her lips were stained with a furious Anthurium red. The nipples of her breasts flashed, painted like two pods of red pepper."
"Il referma ses cartons et, une fois de plus, il tomba, désorienté, dans le spleen. Afin de changer le cours de ses idées, il essaya des lectures émollientes, tenta, en vue de se réfrigérer le cerveau, des solanées de l'art, lut ces livres si charmants pour les convalescents et les mal-à-l'aise que des oeuvres plus tétaniques ou plus riches en phosphates fatigueraient, les romans de Dickens.","He closed his boxes and, once again, he fell, disoriented, into the spleen. In order to change the course of his ideas, he tried emollient readings, tried, with a view to refrigerating his brain, solaneas of art, read those books so charming for convalescents and the ill-at-ease that works more tetanic or richer in phosphates would tire out the novels of Dickens.","He shut his portfolios and once more fell into a mood of splenetic indecision. To change the trend of his thoughts, he began a course of emollient reading; tried to cool his brain with some of the solanaceae of literature;1 read those books that are so charmingly adapted for convalescents and invalids, whom more tetanic or phosphatic works would only fatigue: the novels of Charles Dickens.","He closed his portfolios and, completely disconcerted, again plunged into melancholy. To divert the current of his thoughts and cool his brain, he sought books that would soothe him and turned to the romances of Dickens, those charming novels which are so satisfying to invalids and convalescents who might grow fatigued by works of a more profound and vigorous nature."
"Il la contempla curieusement; semblables à des crins crespelés par des fers trop chauds, ses cheveux frisaient en se cassant du bout; des urnes de Népenthès pendaient à ses oreilles; des tons de veau cuit brillaient dans ses narines entrouvertes. Les yeux pâmés, elle l'appela tout bas.","He looked at her curiously; like horsehair crimped by irons that were too hot, her hair curled as it broke off at the end; urns of Nepenthes hung from his ears; tones of cooked veal shone in his half-open nostrils. With swooning eyes, she called him softly.","He gazed at her inquisitively. Like horsehair crimped by over-hot irons, her hair was frizzy, with broken ends; two Nepenthes pitchers hung from her ears; tints of boiled veal showed in her half-opened nostrils. Her eyes gleaming ecstatically, she called to him in a low voice.","He contemplated her with curiosity. As though frizzed by overheated irons, her hair curled, becoming straight again at the end; her distended nostrils were the color of roast veal. Her eyes were desirous, and she called to him in low tones."
"- Dans deux jours je serai à Paris; allons, fit-il, tout est bien fini; comme un raz de marée, les vagues de la médiocrité humaine montent jusqu'au ciel et elles vont engloutir le refuge dont j'ouvre, malgré moi, les digues. Ah! le courage me fait défaut et le coeur me lève! - Seigneur, prenez pitié du chrétien qui doute, de l'incrédule qui voudrait croire, du forçat de la vie qui s'embarque seul, dans la nuit, sous un firmament que n'éclairent plus les consolants fanaux du vieil espoir!","- In two days I will be in Paris; come on, he said, it's all over; like a tidal wave, the waves of human mediocrity rise to the sky and they will engulf the refuge of which I open, in spite of myself, the dykes.

Like a tide-race, the waves of human mediocrity are rising to the heavens and will engulf this refuge, for I am opening the flood-gates myself, against my will. Ah! but my courage fails me, and my heart is sick within me! – Lord, take pity on the Christian who doubts, on the unbeliever who would fain believe, on the galley-slave of life who puts out to sea alone, in the night, beneath a firmament no longer lit by the consoling beacon-fires of the ancient hope!’","“I shall be in Paris in two days. Well, all is finished. The waves of human mediocrity rise to the sky and they will engulf the refuge whose dams I open. Ah! courage leaves me, my heart breaks! O Lord, pity the Christian who doubts, the sceptic who would believe, the convict of life embarking alone in the night, under a sky no longer illumined by the consoling beacons of ancient faith.”"
"Et cependant, malgré tout, il n'y avait encore que les ecclésiastiques parmi lesquels des Esseintes pouvait espérer des relations appariées jusqu'à un certain point avec ses goûts; dans la société de chanoines généralement doctes et bien élevés, il aurait pu passer quelques soirées affables et douillettes; mais encore eût-il fallu qu'il partageât leurs croyances, qu'il ne flottât point entre des idées sceptiques et des élans de conviction qui remontaient de temps à autre, sur l'eau, soutenus par les souvenirs de son enfance.","And yet, in spite of everything, there were still only the ecclesiastics among whom Des Esseintes could hope for relations matched up to a certain point with his tastes; in the company of generally learned and well-bred canons, he might have spent some affable and cozy evenings; but still it would have been necessary that he shared their beliefs, that he did not float between skeptical ideas and outbursts of conviction which rose from time to time, on the water, sustained by the memories of his childhood.","And yet, in spite of everything, it was still only among the ecclesiastics that Des Esseintes could hope to enjoy relations in some degree of accordance with his tastes. In the company of canons, who were generally men of learning and good breeding, he might have spent some affable and agreeable evenings; but then he would have had to share their beliefs and not oscillate between sceptical ideas and sudden fits of faith which recurred from time to time under the impulse of his childhood memories.","And yet, in spite of everything, it was only among the ecclesiastics that Des Esseintes could hope for pleasurable contract. In the society of well-bred and learned canons, he would have been compelled to share their faith, to refrain from floating between sceptical ideas and transports of conviction which rose from time to time on the water, sustained by recollections of childhood. He would have had to muster identical opinions and never admit (he freely did in his ardent moments)"
"Il avait inutilement aussi tenté de comprendre les délices de ces ouvrages où l'on découvre des récits tels que ceux-ci: ""J'ai suspendu, ce matin, à côté du lit de papa, une croix qu'une petite fille lui donna hier."" - ""Nous sommes invitées, Mimi et moi, à assister, demain, chez M. Roquiers, à la bénédiction d'une cloche; cette course ne me déplaît pas""; - où l'on relève des événements de cette importance: ""Je viens de suspendre à mon cou une médaille de la sainte Vierge que Louise m'a envoyée, pour préservatif du choléra""; - de la poésie de ce genre: ""O le beau rayon de lune qui vient de tomber sur l'évangile que je lisais!"" - enfin, des observations aussi pénétrantes et aussi fines que celle-ci ""Quand je vois passer devant une croix un homme qui se signe ou ôte son chapeau, je me dis: Voilà un chrétien qui passe.""","He had also tried in vain to understand the delights of these works where we discover stories such as these: ""I hung, this morning, next to dad's bed, a cross that a little girl gave him yesterday."" - ""We are invited, Mimi and I, to attend, tomorrow, at Mr. Roquiers, the blessing of a bell; this race does not displease me""; - where we find events of this importance: ""I have just hung around my neck a medallion of the Blessed Virgin that Louise sent me, as a preservative against cholera""; - poetry of this kind: ""O the beautiful ray of the moon which has just fallen on the gospel which I was reading!"" - finally, observations as penetrating and as fine as this one ""When I see a man pass in front of a cross who crosses himself or takes off his hat, I say to myself: Here is a Christian who passes.""","Try as he might, he could not see what attraction lay in books distinguished by remarks such as these: ‘This morning I hung up by papa’s bed a cross a little girl gave him yesterday’, and ‘We are invited tomorrow, Mimi and I, to attend the blessing of a bell at Monsieur Roquier’s – a welcome diversion’; or by mention of such momentous events as this: ‘I have just hung about my neck a chain bearing a medal of Our Lady which Louise sent me as a safeguard against cholera’; or by poetry of this calibre: ‘Oh, what a lovely moonbeam has just fallen on the Gospel I was reading!’ – or finally, by observations as subtle and perspicacious as this: ‘Whenever I see a man cross himself or take his hat off on passing a crucifix, I say to myself: There goes a Christian.’","He had also unavailingly attempted to comprehend the delights of those works in which one may find such things as these: This morning I hung on papa's bed a cross which a little girl had given him yesterday. Or: Mimi and I are invited by Monsieur Roquiers to attend the consecration of a bell tomorrow. This does not displease me at all. Or wherein we find such important events as these: On my neck I have hung a medal of the Holy Virgin which Louise had brought me, as an amulet against cholera. Or poetry of this sort: O the lovely moonbeam which fell on the Bible I was reading! And, finally, such fine and penetrating observations as these: When I see a man pass before a crucifix, lift his hat and make the sign of the Cross, I say to myself, ‘There goes a Christian.’"
"Des Esseintes se faisait ces réflexions, en relisant, çà et là, quelques passages de ce livre et, comparant ce style nerveux et varié au style lymphatique et fixé de ses confrères, il songeait aussi à cette évolution de la langue qu'a si justement révélée Darwin.","Des Esseintes made these reflections, re-reading, here and there, a few passages of this book and, comparing this nervous and varied style to the lymphatic and fixed style of his colleagues, he also thought of this evolution of the language that has so rightly revealed Darwin.","Such were Des Esseintes’s reflections as he dipped into the book, rereading a passage here and there; and then, comparing the author’s vigorous and varied style with the lymphatic, stereotyped style of his fellow writers, he was led to consider that evolution of language so accurately described by Darwin.","Des Esseintes reflected in this wise while re-reading, here and there, several passages of the book and, comparing its nervous and changing style with the fixed manner of other Church writers, he thought of the evolution of language which Darwin has so truly revealed."
"Il se rongea les ongles, cherchant les moyens de concilier ces mésalliances, d'empêcher le divorce résolu de ces tons, il découvrit enfin que sa première idée, consistant à vouloir attiser les feux de l'étoffe par le balancement d'un objet sombre mis dessus était fausse en somme, ce tapis était encore trop voyant, trop pétulant, trop neuf. Les couleurs ne s'étaient pas suffisamment émoussées et amoindries; il s'agissait de renverser la proposition, d'amortir les tons, de les éteindre par le contraste d'un objet éclatant, écrasant tout autour de lui, jetant de la lumière d'or sur de l'argent pâle. Ainsi posée, la question devenait plus facile à résoudre. Il se détermina, en conséquence, à faire glacer d'or la cuirasse de sa tortue.","He bit his nails, looking for ways to reconcile these misalliances, to prevent the resolute divorce of these tones, he finally discovered that his first idea, consisting in wanting to fan the fires of the fabric by the swinging of a dark object put on it was wrong in short, this carpet was still too showy, too lively, too new. The colors hadn't dulled and faded enough; it was a question of reversing the proposition, of deadening the tones, of extinguishing them by the contrast of a dazzling object, crushing everything around it, throwing golden light on pale silver. Thus posed, the question became easier to solve. He determined, therefore, to glaze the cuirass of his tortoise with gold.","He bit his nails, trying to discover a way of resolving the marital discord between these tints and preventing an absolute divorce. At last he came to the conclusion that his original idea of using a dark object moving to and fro to stir up the fires within the woollen pile was mistaken. The fact of the matter was that the carpet was still too bright, too garish, too new-looking; its colours had not yet been sufficiently toned down and subdued. The thing was to reverse his first plan and to deaden those colours, to dim them by the contrast of a brilliant object that would kill everything around it, drowning the gleams of silver in a golden radiance. Stated in these terms, the problem was easier to solve; and Des Esseintes accordingly decided to have his tortoise’s buckler glazed with gold.1","He bit his nails while he studied a method of removing these discords and reconciling the determined opposition of the tones. He finally discovered that his first inspiration, which was to animate the fire of the weave by setting it off against some dark object, was erroneous. In fact, this rug was too new, too petulant and gaudy. The colors were not sufficiently subdued. He must reverse the process, dull the tones, and extinguish them by the contrast of a striking object, which would eclipse all else and cast a golden light on the pale silver. Thus stated, the problem was easier to solve. He therefore decided to glaze the shell of the tortoise with gold."
"Il y avait de cela quelques années, il s'était croisé, rue de Rivoli, un soir, avec un galopin d'environ seize ans, un enfant pâlot et fûté, tentant de même qu'une fille. Il suçait péniblement une cigarette dont le papier crevait, percé par les bûches pointues du caporal. Tout en pestant, il frottait sur sa cuisse des allumettes de cuisine qui ne partaient point; il les usa toutes. Apercevant alors des Esseintes qui l'observait, il s'approcha, la main sur la visière de sa casquette et lui demanda poliment du feu. Des Esseintes lui offrit d'aromatiques cigarettes de dubèque, puis il entama la conversation et incita l'enfant à lui conter son histoire.","A few years ago, he had crossed paths, in the rue de Rivoli, one evening, with a urchin of about sixteen, a pale and shrewd child, tempting just like a girl. He was painfully sucking on a cigarette whose paper was bursting, pierced by the corporal's pointed logs. While cursing, he rubbed kitchen matches on his thigh which wouldn't go away; he used them all. Then seeing Des Esseintes watching him, he approached, his hand on the visor of his cap, and politely asked him for a light. Des Esseintes offered him some aromatic Dubeque cigarettes, then he struck up a conversation and encouraged the child to tell him his story.","Some years ago, he remembered he had been walking along the Rue de Rivoli one evening, when he had come across a young scamp of sixteen or so, a peaky-faced, sharp-eyed child, as attractive in his way as any girl. He was sucking hard at a cigarette, the paper of which had burst where bits of the coarse tobacco were poking through. Cursing away, the boy was striking kitchen matches on his thigh; not one of them would light and soon he had used them all up. Catching sight of Des Esseintes, who was standing watching him, he came up, touched his cap and politely asked for a light. Des Esseintes offered him some of his own scented Dubèques, got into conversation with the boy and persuaded him to tell the story of his life.","Although he experienced no inclination for the state of grace, he felt a genuine sympathy for those souls immured in monasteries, persecuted by a vengeful society which can forgive neither the merited scorn with which it inspires them, nor the desire to expiate, to atone by long silences, for the ever growing shamelessness of its ridiculous or trifling gossipings."
"La figure était troublante; pâle et tirée, assez régulière sous les longs cheveux noirs, elle était éclairée par de grands yeux humides, aux paupières cernées de bleu, rapprochés du nez que pointillaient d'or quelques rousseurs et sous lequel s'ouvrait une bouche petite, mais bordée de grosses lèvres, coupées, au milieu, d'une raie ainsi qu'une cerise.","The figure was disturbing; pale and drawn, fairly regular under her long black hair, she was lit by large moist eyes, with blue-rimmed eyelids, set close to a nose dotted with gold with a few red spots and under which opened a small mouth, but lined with big lips, parted in the middle, like a cherry.","The face was somewhat disconcerting; pale and drawn, with fairly regular features topped by long black hair, it was lit up by two great liquid eyes, ringed with blue and set close to the nose, which was dotted with a few golden freckles; the mouth was small, but spoilt by fleshy lips with a line dividing them in the middle like a cherry.","He had regretted her defection, and now, recalling her, the other women seemed insipid, their childish graces and monotonous coquetry disgusting him."
Ses inquiétudes s'accrurent; malheureusement les moyens de dompter l'inexorable maladie manquèrent. Il avait sans succès tenté d'installer des appareils hydrothérapiques dans son cabinet de toilette.,His worries increased; unfortunately the means of taming the inexorable disease were wanting. He had unsuccessfully attempted to install hydrotherapy devices in his bathroom.,"His anxiety and depression grew worse, and unfortunately the means of mastering this inexorable illness were lacking. He had tried to install a set of hydropathic appliances in his dressing-room, but without success: the impossibility of bringing water as high up the hill as his house, not to mention the difficulty of getting water in sufficient quantity in a village where the public fountains only produced a feeble trickle at fixed hours, thwarted this particular plan.",His alarm increased; but unfortunately the means of subduing the inexorable malady were not at hand. He had unsuccessfully sought to install a hydropathic apparatus in his dressing room.
"Mais ces volumes produisirent un effet contraire à celui qu'il attendait: ces chastes amoureux, ces héroïnes protestantes, vêtues jusqu'au cou, s'aimaient parmi les étoiles, se bornaient à baisser les yeux, à rougir, à pleurer de bonheur, en se serrant les mains. Aussitôt cette exagération de pureté le lança dans un excès opposé; en vertu de la loi des contrastes, il sauta d'un extrême à l'autre, se rappela des scènes vibrantes et corsées, songea aux pratiques humaines des couples, aux baisers mélangés, aux baisers colombins, ainsi que les désigne la pudeur ecclésiastique, quand ils pénètrent entre les lèvres.","But these volumes produced an effect contrary to that which he expected: these chaste lovers, these Protestant heroines, dressed up to their necks, loved each other among the stars, confined themselves to lowering their eyes, to blushing, to weeping with happiness, shaking hands. This exaggeration of purity immediately threw him into an opposite excess; by virtue of the law of contrasts, he jumped from one extreme to the other, remembered vibrant and full-bodied scenes, thought of the human practices of couples, of mixed kisses, of colombian kisses, as ecclesiastical modesty designates them, when they penetrate between the lips.","But the Englishman’s works produced the opposite effect from what he had expected: his chaste lovers and his puritanical heroines in their all-concealing draperies, sharing ethereal passions and just fluttering their eyelashes, blushing coyly, weeping for joy and holding hands, drove him to distraction. This exaggerated virtue made him react in the contrary direction; by virtue of the law of contrasts, he jumped from one extreme to the other, recalled scenes of full-blooded, earthy passion, and thought of common amorous practices such as the hybrid kiss, or the columbine kiss as ecclesiastical modesty calls it, where the tongue is brought into play.","But they produced an effect contrary to his expectations. These chaste lovers, these protesting heroines garbed to the neck, loved among the stars, confined themselves to lowered eyes and blushes, wept tears of joy and clasped hands—an exaggeration of purity which threw him into an opposite excess. By the law of contrast, he leaped from one extreme to the other, let his imagination dwell on vibrant scenes between human lovers, and mused on their sensual kisses and passionate embraces."
"Peu à peu, en même temps qu'il l'observait, de singulières conceptions naquirent; à mesure qu'il admirait sa souplesse et sa force, il voyait un artificiel changement de sexe se produire en elle; ses singeries gracieuses, ses mièvreries de femelle s'effaçaient de plus en plus, tandis que se développaient, à leur place, les charmes agiles et puissants d'un mâle; en un mot, après avoir tout d'abord été femme, puis, après avoir hésité, après avoir avoisiné l'androgyne, elle semblait se résoudre, se préciser, devenir complètement un homme.","Gradually, as he observed it, singular conceptions were born; as he admired her suppleness and her strength, he saw an artificial change of sex taking place in her; her graceful antics, her feminine insipidities faded away more and more, while the agile and powerful charms of a male developed in their place; in a word, after having first been a woman, then, after hesitating, after approaching the androgyne, she seemed to resolve herself, to define herself, to become completely a man.","Little by little, as he watched her, curious fancies took shape in his mind. The more he admired her suppleness and strength, the more he thought he saw an artificial change of sex operating in her; her mincing movements and feminine affectations became ever less obtrusive, and in their place there developed the agile, vigorous charms of a male. In short, after being a woman to begin with, then hesitating in a condition verging on the androgynous, she seemed to have made up her mind and become an integral, unmistakable man.","Gradually, as he watched her, a fantastic idea seized him. Her graceful antics and arch feminine ways receded to the background of his mind, replaced by her power and strength which had for him all the charm of masculinity."
"À Rome, le paganisme mourant avait modifié sa prosodie, transmué sa langue, avec Ausone, avec Claudien, avec Rutilius dont le style attentif et scrupuleux, capiteux et sonnant, présentait, surtout dans ses parties descriptives de reflets, d'ombres, de nuances, une nécessaire analogie avec le style des de Goncourt.","In Rome, dying paganism had modified its prosody, transmuted its language, with Ausonius, with Claudian, with Rutilius whose attentive and scrupulous style, heady and ringing, presented, especially in its descriptive parts, reflections, shadows, nuances , a necessary analogy with the style of the de Goncourts.","In Rome, expiring paganism had modified its prosody and transmuted its language through Ausonius, through Claudian, above all through Rutilius, whose style, careful and scrupulous, sensuous and sonorous, presented an obvious analogy with the Goncourt brothers’ style, especially when describing light and shade and colour.","At Rome, the dying paganism had modified its prosody and transmuted its language with Ausonius, with Claudian and Rutilius whose attentive, scrupulous, sonorous and powerful style presented, in its descriptive parts especially, reflections, hints and nuances bearing an affinity with the style of de Goncourt."
"Les hommes débarquèrent ensuite des touffes de feuilles, losangées, vert-bouteille; au milieu s'élevait une baguette au bout de laquelle tremblotait un grand as de coeur, aussi vernissé qu'un piment; comme pour narguer tous les aspects connus des plantes, du milieu de cet as d'un vermillon intense, jaillissait une queue charnue, cotonneuse, blanche et jaune, droite chez les unes, tire-bouchonnée, tout en haut du coeur, de même qu'une queue de cochon, chez les autres. C'était l'Anthurium, une aroïdée récemment importée de Colombie en France; elle faisait partie d'un lot de cette famille à laquelle appartenait aussi un Amorphophallus, une plante de Cochinchine, aux feuilles taillées en truelles à poissons, aux longues tiges noires couturées de balafres, pareilles à des membres endommagés de nègre.","The men then landed tufts of leaves, diamond-shaped, bottle-green; in the middle rose a wand, at the end of which quivered a large ace of hearts, as glazed as a pepper; as if to taunt all the known aspects of plants, from the middle of this ace of intense vermilion, sprang a fleshy tail, fluffy, white and yellow, straight in some, corkscrew, at the very top of the heart, just as a pigtail, among others. It was the Anthurium, an aroid recently imported from Colombia to France; she belonged to a batch of this family to which also belonged an Amorphophallus, a plant from Cochin China, with leaves shaped like fish trowels, with long black stems stitched with scars, like the damaged limbs of a negro.","Next the men unloaded several bunches of lozenge-shaped leaves, bottle-green in colour; from the midst of each bunch rose a stiff stem on top of which trembled a great ace of hearts, as glossy as a pepper; and then, as if in defiance of all the familiar aspects of plant life, there sprang from the middle of this bright vermilion heart a fleshy, downy tail, all white and yellow, straight in some cases, corkscrewing above the heart like a pig’s tail in others. This was the Anthurium, an aroid recently imported from Colombia; it belonged to a section of the same family as a certain Amorphophallus, a plant from Cochin-China with leaves the shape of fish-slices and long black stalks crisscrossed with scars like the limbs of a negro slave.","The men next brought clusters of leaves, lozenge-like in shape and bottle-green in color. In the center rose a rod at whose end a varnished ace of hearts swayed. As though meaning to defy all conceivable forms of plants, a fleshy stalk climbed through the heart of this intense vermilion ace— a stalk that in some specimens was straight, in others showed ringlets like a pig's tail. It was the Anthurium, an aroid recently imported into France from Columbia; a variety of that family to which also belonged an Amorphophallus, a Cochin China plant with leaves shaped like fish-knives, with long dark stems seamed with gashes, like lambs flecked with black."
"En effet, ces fleurs sont en taffetas, montées sur du fil d'archal, et la senteur printanière filtre par les joints de la fenêtre, exhalée des usines du voisinage, des parfumeries de Pinaud et de Saint-James.","Indeed, these flowers are in taffeta, mounted on archal thread, and the scent of spring filters through the seals of the window, exhaled from the neighboring factories, from the perfumeries of Pinaud and Saint-James.","‘The truth is that these flowers are made of taffeta and mounted on binding wire, while this vernal fragrance has come filtering in through cracks in the window-frame from the neighbouring factories where the Pinaud and St James perfumes are made.","“In fact, these flowers are made of taffeta and are mounted on wire. The springtime odor filters through the window joints, exhaled from the neighboring factories, from the perfumeries of Pinaud and Saint James."
"Sous prétexte de liberté et de progrès, la Société avait encore découvert le moyen d'aggraver la misérable condition de l'homme, en l'arrachant à son chez lui, en l'affublant d'un costume ridicule, en lui distribuant des armes particulières, en l'abrutissant sous un esclavage identique à celui dont on avait jadis affranchi, par compassion, les nègres, et tout cela pour le mettre à même d'assassiner son prochain, sans risquer l'échafaud, comme les ordinaires meurtriers qui opèrent, seuls, sans uniformes, avec des armes moins bruyantes et moins rapides.","Under the pretext of freedom and progress, society had discovered yet another means of aggravating the miserable condition of man, by dragging him from his home, by dressing him up in a ridiculous costume, by distributing arms to him. by brutalizing him under a slavery identical to that from which the negroes had once been freed, out of compassion, and all this to put him in a position to assassinate his neighbor, without risking the scaffold, like the ordinary murderers who operate , alone, without uniforms, with less noisy and slower weapons.","Similarly, under the pretext of encouraging liberty and progress, society had discovered yet another means of aggravating man’s wretched lot, by dragging him from his home, rigging him out in a ridiculous costume, putting specially designed weapons into his hands and reducing him to the same degrading slavery from which the negroes were released out of pity – and all this to put him in a position to kill his neighbour without risking the scaffold, as ordinary murderers do who operate single-handed, without uniforms and with quieter, poorer weapons.","Then, under pretext of liberty and progress, Society had discovered another means of increasing man's miseries by tearing him from his home, forcing him to don a ridiculous uniform and carry weapons, by brutalizing him in a slavery in every respect like that from which he had compassionately freed the negro, and all to enable him to slaughter his neighbor without risking the scaffold like ordinary murderers who operate single-handed, without uniforms and with weapons that are less swift and deafening."
"Il se demanda quelle était cette femme qu'il sentait entrée, implantée depuis longtemps déjà dans son intimité et dans sa vie; il cherchait en vain son origine, son nom, son métier, sa raison d'être; aucun souvenir ne lui revenait de cette liaison inexplicable et pourtant certaine.","He wondered who was this woman he felt had entered, established for a long time already in his intimacy and in his life; he searched in vain for his origin, his name, his trade, his reason for being; no memory came back to him of this inexplicable and yet certain affair.","He asked himself who this woman was whom he felt to have been deeply and intimately associated with his life for a long time, and he tried to remember her origins, her name, her occupation, her significance – but all in vain, for no recollection came to him of this inexplicable yet undeniable liaison.","He asked himself who the woman could be; he felt that she had long been an intimate part of his life; vainly he sought her origin, her name, her profession, her reason for being.

"La verve sauvage, le talent âpre, éperdu de Goya le captait; mais l'universelle admiration que ses oeuvres avaient conquise, le détournait néanmoins un peu, et il avait renoncé, depuis des années, à les encadrer, de peur qu'en les mettant en évidence, le premier imbécile venu ne jugeât nécessaire de lâcher des âneries et de s'extasier, sur un mode tout appris, devant elles.","The wild verve, the harsh, wild talent of Goya captivated him; but the universal admiration that his works had won, nonetheless turned him away a little, and he had given up, years ago, framing them, for fear that by highlighting them, the first imbecile who came along would deem it necessary to let go of nonsense and ecstasy, in a learned way, in front of them.","Goya’s savage verve, his harsh, brutal genius, captivated Des Esseintes. On the other hand, the universal admiration his works had won rather put him off, and for years he had refrained from framing them, for fear that if he hung them up, the first idiot who saw them might feel obliged to dishonour them with a few inanities and go into stereotyped ecstasies over them.","Goya's savage verve and keenly fanciful talent delighted him, but the universal admiration his works had won nevertheless estranged him slightly. And for years he had refused to frame them for fear that the first blundering fool who caught sight of them might deem it necessary to fly into banal and facile raptures before them."
"Il était, dans la rue de Rivoli, devant le Galignani's Messenger. Séparées par une porte aux verres dépolis couverts d'inscriptions et munis de passe-partout encadrant des découpures de journaux et des bandes azurées de télégrammes, deux grandes vitrines regorgeaient d'albums et de livres. Il s'approcha, attiré par la vue de ces cartonnages en papier bleu-perruquier et vert-chou gaufrés, sur toutes les coutures, de ramages d'argent et d'or, de ces couvertures en toiles couleur carmélite, poireau, caca d'oie, groseille, estampées au fer froid, sur les plats et le dos, de filets noirs. Tout cela avait une touche antiparisienne, une tournure mercantile, plus brutale et pourtant moins vile que celles des reliures de camelote, en France; çà et là, au milieu d'albums ouverts, reproduisant des scènes humoristiques de du Maurier et de John Leech, ou lançant au travers de plaines en chromo les délirantes cavalcades de Caldecott, quelques romans français apparaissaient, mêlant à ces verjus de teintes, des vulgarités bénignes et satisfaites.","He was in the rue de Rivoli, in front of Galignani's Messenger. Separated by a door with frosted glass covered with inscriptions and furnished with mats framing newspaper clippings and azure strips of telegrams, two large windows were overflowing with albums and books. He approached, attracted by the sight of these cartonnages in wig-blue and cabbage-green paper embossed on all the seams with silver and gold flourishes, these carmelite, leek-coloured linen covers, goose, currant, stamped with a cold iron, on the covers and the back, with black fillets. All this had an anti-Parisian touch, a mercantile twist, more brutal and yet less vile than that of junk bindings in France; here and there, in the middle of open albums, reproducing humorous scenes from du Maurier and John Leech, or launching across plains in chromo the delirious cavalcades of Caldecott, a few French novels appeared, mixing with these verjuices of tints, benign and satisfied vulgarities.","He was now in the Rue de Rivoli, outside Galignani’s Messenger. There, on either side of a frosted-glass door whose panels were covered with lettering and with newspaper-cuttings and blue telegram-forms framed in passe-partout, were two huge windows crammed with books and picture-albums. He went up to them, attracted by the sight of books bound in paper boards coloured butcher’s-blue or cabbage-green and decorated along the seams with gold and silver flowers, as well as others covered in cloth dyed nut-brown, leek-green, lemon-yellow or currant-red, and stamped with black lines on the back and sides. All this had an un-Parisian air about it, a mercantile flavour, coarser yet less contemptible than the impression produced by cheap French bindings. Here and there, among open albums showing comic scenes by Du Maurier or John Leech and chromos of wild cross-country gallops by Caldecott, a few French novels were in fact to be seen, tempering this riot of brilliant colours with the safe, stolid vulgarity of their covers.","He was in the rue de Rivoli, in front of Galignani's Messenger.

"Ah! c'était à lui-même que cette voix aussi mystérieuse qu'une incantation, parlait; c'était à lui qu'elle racontait sa fièvre d'inconnu, son idéal inassouvi, son besoin d'échapper à l'horrible réalité de l'existence, à franchir les confins de la pensée, à tâtonner sans jamais arriver à une certitude, dans les brumes des au-delà de l'art! - Toute la misère de ses propres efforts lui refoula le coeur. Doucement, il étreignait la femme silencieuse, à ses côtés, se réfugiant, ainsi qu'un enfant inconsolé, près d'elle, ne voyant même pas l'air maussade de la comédienne obligée à jouer une scène, à exercer son métier, chez elle, aux instants du repos, loin de la rampe.","Ah! it was to himself that this voice, as mysterious as an incantation, spoke; it was to him that she told her fever of the unknown, her unfulfilled ideal, her need to escape the horrible reality of existence, to cross the confines of thought, to grope around without ever arriving at a certainty. , in the mists of beyond art! - All the misery of his own efforts repressed his heart.

The paltriness of his own efforts was borne in upon him and cut him to the heart.

The poignant tragedy of his past failures rent his heart. Gently he clasped the silent woman at his side, he sought refuge in her nearness, like a child who is inconsolable; he was blind to the sulkiness of the comedienne obliged to perform off-scene, in her leisure moments, far from the spotlight. Their liaison continued, but his spells of exhaustion soon became acute."
"Depuis des années, les huiles saintes étaient adultérées par de la graisse de volaille; la cire, par des os calcinés; l'encens, par de la vulgaire résine et du vieux benjoin.

"Le Bon Samaritain, du même artiste, un immense dessin à la plume, tiré sur pierre: un extravagant fouillis de palmiers, de sorbiers, de chênes, poussés, tous ensemble, au mépris des saisons et des climats, une élancée de forêt vierge, criblée de singes, de hiboux, de chouettes, bossuée de vieilles souches aussi difformes que des racines de mandragore, une futaie magique, trouée, au milieu, par une éclaircie laissant entrevoir, au loin, derrière un chameau et le groupe du Samaritain et du blessé, un fleuve, puis une ville féerique escaladant l'horizon, montant dans un ciel étrange, pointillé d'oiseaux, moutonné de lames, comme gonflé de ballots de nuages.","The Good Samaritan, by the same artist, an immense pen drawing, printed on stone: an extravagant jumble of palm trees, rowan trees, oaks, growing together, in defiance of seasons and climates, a slender stretch of virgin forest, riddled with monkeys, owls, owls, bumpy with old stumps as deformed as mandrake roots, a magic forest, pierced in the middle by a clearing allowing a glimpse, in the distance, behind a camel and the group of the Samaritan and the wounded, a river, then a magical city scaling the horizon, rising in a strange sky, dotted with birds, mottled with waves, as if swollen with bundles of clouds.","Another was The Good Samaritan by the same artist, a lithograph of a huge pen-and-ink drawing. Here the scene is a fantastic tangle of palms, service-trees and oaks, growing all together in defiance of season and climate; a patch of virgin forest packed with monkeys, owls and screech-owls, and cumbered with old tree-stumps as unshapely as mandrake roots; a magic wood with a clearing in the centre affording a distant glimpse, first of the Samaritan and the wounded man, then of a river and finally of a fairytale city climbing up to the horizon to meet a strange sky dotted with birds, flecked with foaming billows, swelling, as it were, with cloudy waves.","The Good Samaritan, by the same artist, is a large engraving on stone: an incongruous medley of palms, sorbs and oaks grown together, heedless of seasons and climates, peopled with monkeys and owls, covered with old stumps as misshapen as the roots of the mandrake; then a magical forest, cut in the center near a glade through which a stream can be seen far away, behind a camel and the Samaritan group; then an elfin town appearing on the horizon of an exotic sky dotted with birds and covered with masses of fleecy clouds."
"Il convint avec eux aussi du sens de certaines sonneries, détermina la signification des coups de timbre, selon leur nombre, leur brièveté, leur longueur; désigna, sur son bureau, la place où ils devaient, tous les mois, déposer, pendant son sommeil, le livre des comptes; il s'arrangea, enfin, de façon à ne pas être souvent obligé de leur parler ou de les voir.","He also agreed with them on the meaning of certain bells, determined the meaning of the gongs, according to their number, their brevity, their length; designated, on his desk, the place where, every month, they were to deposit, while he slept, the account book; he managed, finally, so as not to be often obliged to speak to them or to see them.","He also arranged a code of signals with them so that they should know what he needed by the number of long or short peals he rang on his bell; and he appointed a particular spot on his desk where the household account-book was to be left once a month while he was asleep.

"Il mania l'ambre, le musc-tonkin, aux éclats terribles, le patchouli, le plus âcre des parfums végétaux et dont la fleur, à l'état brut, dégage un remugle de moisi et de rouille. Quoi qu'il fît, la hantise du XVIIIe siècle l'obséda; les robes à paniers, les falbalas tournèrent devant ses yeux; des souvenirs des ""Vénus"" de Boucher, tout en chair, sans os, bourrées de coton rose, s'installèrent sur ses murs des rappels du roman de Thémidore, de l'exquise Rosette retroussée dans un désespoir couleur feu, le poursuivirent. Furieux, il se leva et, afin de se libérer, il renifla, de toutes ses forces, cette pure essence de spikanard, si chère aux Orientaux et si désagréable aux Européens, à cause de son relent trop prononcé de valériane. Il demeura étourdi sous la violence de ce choc; comme pilées par un coup de marteau, les filigranes de la délicate odeur disparurent; il profita de ce temps de répit pour échapper aux siècles défunts, aux vapeurs surannées, pour entrer, ainsi qu'il le faisait jadis, dans des oeuvres moins restreintes ou plus neuves.","He handled amber, musk-tonkin, with its terrible bursts, patchouli, the most pungent of vegetable perfumes, the flower of which, in its raw state, gives off a hint of mold and rust. Whatever he did, the fear of the eighteenth century obsessed him; the dresses with baskets, the furbelows turned before his eyes; Memories of Boucher's ""Venus"", all flesh, boneless, stuffed with pink cotton, settled on its walls. Reminders of Themidore's novel, of the exquisite Rosette rolled up in fire-colored despair, pursued him. Furious, he got up and, in order to free himself, he sniffed, with all his might, that pure essence of spikanard, so dear to Orientals and so disagreeable to Europeans, because of its overly strong valerian scent. He remained stunned by the violence of this shock; as if crushed by a blow of a hammer, the filigrees of the delicate odor disappeared; he took advantage of this time of respite to escape the defunct centuries, the superannuated vapors, to enter, as he did formerly, into less restricted or newer works.","He handled, one after the other, amber, Tonquin musk, with its overpowering smell, and patchouli, the most pungent of all vegetable perfumes, whose flower, in its natural state, gives off an odour of mildew and mould. Do what he would, however, visions of the eighteenth century haunted him: gowns with panniers and flounces danced before his eyes; Boucher Venuses, all flesh and no bone, stuffed with pink cotton-wool, looked down at him from every wall; memories of the novel Thémidore,4 and especially of the exquisite Rosette with her skirts hoisted up in blushing despair, pursued him. He sprang to his feet in a fury, and to rid himself of these obsessions he filled his lungs with that unadulterated essence of spikenard which is so dear to Orientals and so abhorrent to Europeans on account of its excessive valerian content. He was stunned by the violence of the shock this gave him. The filigree of the delicate scent which had been troubling him vanished as if it had been pounded with a hammer; and he took advantage of this respite to escape from past epochs and antiquated odours in order to engage, as he had been used to do in other days, in less restricted and more up-to-date operations.","He worked with amber and with Tonkin musk, marvelously powerful; with patchouli, the most poignant of vegetable perfumes whose flower, in its habitat, wafts an odor of mildew. Try what he would, the eighteenth century obsessed him; the panier robes and furbelows appeared before his eyes; memories of Boucher's Venus haunted him; recollections of Themidor's romance, of the exquisite Rosette pursued him. Furious, he rose and to rid himself of the obsession, with all his strength he inhaled that pure essence of spikenard, so dear to Orientals and so repulsive to Europeans because of its pronounced odor of valerian. He was stunned by the violence of the shock. As though pounded by hammer strokes, the filigranes of the delicate odor disappeared; he profited by the period of respite to escape the dead centuries, the antiquated fumes, and to enter, as he formerly had done, less limited or more recent works."

"Un accès de rage balayait, ainsi qu'un ouragan, ses essais de résignation, ses tentatives d'indifférence.

To show once and for all that he existed, the terrible God of Genesis and the pale Unnailed of Golgotha were not going to revive the extinguished cataclysms, rekindle the rains of flame that consumed the once reprobate cities and the towns dead?

Could it be that the terrible God of Genesis and the pale martyr of Golgotha would not prove their existence once for all by renewing the cataclysms of old, by rekindling the rain of fire that once consumed those accursed towns, the cities of the plain?

La lecture de Dickens qu'il avait naguère consommée pour s'apaiser les nerfs et qui n'avait produit que des effets contraires aux effets hygiéniques qu'il espérait, commença lentement à agir dans un sens inattendu, déterminant des visions de l'existence anglaise qu'il ruminait pendant des heures; peu à peu, dans ces contemplations fictives, s'insinuèrent des idées de réalité précise, de voyage accompli, de rêves vérifiés sur lesquels se greffa l'envie d'éprouver des impressions neuves et d'échapper ainsi aux épuisantes débauches de l'esprit s'étourdissant à moudre à vide.","He could not, therefore, procure any resource, any relief near them; but a new phenomenon occurred.

Then, little by little, an idea insinuated itself into his mind – the idea of turning dream into reality, of travelling to England in the flesh as well as in the spirit, of checking the accuracy of his visions; and this idea was allied with a longing to experience new sensations and thus afford some relief to a mind dizzy with hunger and drunk with fantasy.","It was impossible, therefore, to find any solace in their society; but a new phenomenon now occurred.

So his tendencies towards artifice, his cravings for eccentricity, were not, in short, the results of specious studies, of extraterrestrial refinements, of quasi-theological speculations; they were, basically, transports, impulses towards an ideal, towards an unknown universe, towards a distant, desirable bliss like that which the scriptures promise us.","By dint of examining his thought-processes, of trying to join together the threads of his ideas and trace them back to their sources, he came to the conclusion that his activities in the course of his social life had all originated in the education he had received. Thus his penchant for artificiality and his love of eccentricity could surely be explained as the results of sophistical studies, super-terrestrial subtleties, semi-theological speculations; fundamentally, they were ardent aspirations towards an ideal, towards an unknown universe, towards a distant beatitude, as utterly desirable as that promised by the Scriptures.","By examining the process of his reasoning, by seeking to unite its threads and to discover its sources and causes, he concluded that his previous mode of living was derived from the education he had received. Thus, his tendencies towards artificiality and his craving for eccentricity, were no more than the results of specious studies, spiritual refinements and quasi-theological speculations. They were, in the last analysis, ecstacies, aspirations towards an ideal, towards an unknown universe as desirable as that promised us by the Holy Scriptures."
"Enfin, quand il eut assez savouré ce spectacle, il dispersa précipitamment des parfums exotiques, épuisa ses vaporisateurs, accéléra ses esprits concentrés, lâcha bride à tous ses baumes, et, dans la touffeur exaspérée de la pièce, éclata une nature démente et sublimée, forçant ses haleines, chargeant d'alcoolats en délire une artificielle brise, une nature pas vraie et charmante, toute paradoxale, réunissant les piments des tropiques, les souffles poivrés du santal de la Chine et de l'hediosmia de la Jamaïque, aux odeurs françaises du jasmin, de l'aubépine et de la verveine, poussant, en dépit des saisons et des climats, des arbres d'essences diverses, des fleurs aux couleurs et aux fragrances les plus opposées, créant par la fonte et le heurt de tous ces tons, un parfum général, innommé, imprévu, étrange, dans lequel reparaissait, comme un obstiné refrain, la phrase décorative du commencement, l'odeur du grand pré, éventé par les lilas et les tilleuls.","Finally, when he had savored this sight enough, he hurriedly dispersed exotic perfumes, exhausted his vaporizers, quickened his concentrated spirits, unleashed all his balms, and, in the exasperated swelteringness of the room, a demented and sublimated nature burst forth, straining his breath, loading an artificial breeze with delirious alcoholates, an untrue and charming nature, quite paradoxical, bringing together the peppers of the tropics, the peppery breaths of sandalwood from China and hediosmia from Jamaica, with French odors jasmine, hawthorn and verbena, growing, despite the seasons and climates, trees of various species, flowers of the most opposite colors and fragrances, creating by the melting and clashing of all these tones, a general perfume, nameless, unforeseen, strange, in which reappeared, like an obstinate refrain, the decorative phrase of the beginning, the smell of the large meadow, fanned by lilacs and lime trees.","Finally, when he had sufficiently savoured this spectacle, he frantically scattered exotic perfumes around him, emptied his vaporizers, quickened all his concentrated essences and gave free rein to all his balms, with the result that the suffocating room was suddenly filled with an insanely sublimated vegetation, emitting powerful exhalations, impregnating an artificial breeze with raging alcoholates – an unnatural yet charming vegetation, paradoxically uniting tropical spices such as the pungent odours of Chinese sandalwood and Jamaican hediosmia with French scents such as jasmine, hawthorn and vervain; defying climate and season to put forth trees of different smells and flowers of the most divergent colours and fragrances; creating out of the union or collision of all these tones one common perfume, unnamed, unexpected, unusual, in which there reappeared, like a persistent refrain, the decorative phrase he had started with, the smell of the great meadow and the swaying lilacs and linden-trees.","At last, when he had sufficiently enjoyed this sight, he suddenly scattered the exotic perfumes, emptied his vaporizers, threw in his concentrated spirits, poured his balms, and, in the exasperated and stifling heat of the room there rose a crazy sublimated nature, a paradoxical nature which was neither genuine nor charming, reuniting the tropical spices and the peppery breath of Chinese sandal wood and Jamaica hediosmia with the French odors of jasmine, hawthorn and verbena. Regardless of seasons and climates he forced trees of diverse essences into life, and flowers with conflicting fragrances and colors. By the clash of these tones he created a general, nondescript, unexpected, strange perfume in which reappeared, like an obstinate refrain, the decorative phrase of the beginning, the odor of the meadows fanned by the lilacs and lindens."
"Les lampes charbonnaient. Il les remonta et consulta sa montre. - Trois heures du matin. - Il alluma une cigarette et se replongea dans la lecture interrompue par ses rêveries, du vieux poème latin De laude castitatis, écrit sous le règne de Gondebald, par Avitus, évêque métropolitain de Vienne.","The lamps were burning. He wound them up and looked at his watch. - Three in the morning. - He lit a cigarette and went back to reading, interrupted by his daydreams, the old Latin poem De laude castitatis, written during the reign of Gondebald, by Avitus, Metropolitan Bishop of Vienna.","The lamps were smoking. He turned them up and looked at his watch. It was three o’clock in the morning.

"Un seul poète chrétien, Commodien de Gaza représentait dans sa bibliothèque l'art de l'an Ill.

Abandoned children were sheltered instead of being killed and yet their lives daily became increasingly rigorous and barren!"
"Ce livre excessif délectait des Esseintes; aussi avait-il fait tirer, en violet d'évêque, dans un encadrement de pourpre cardinalice, sur un authentique parchemin que les auditeurs de Rote avaient béni, un exemplaire des Diaboliques imprimé avec ces caractères de civilité dont les croches biscornues, dont les paraphes en queues retroussées et en griffes, affectent une forme satanique.","This excessive book delighted in Des Esseintes; also he had printed, in bishop's purple, in a frame of cardinal's purple, on an authentic parchment that the auditors of Rote had blessed, a copy of the Diaboliques printed with these characters of civility including the crooked quavers, whose initials in upturned tails and claws, assume a satanic form.","The extraordinary book that contained this tale was Des Esseintes’s delight; he had therefore had printed for him in bishop’s-purple ink, within a border of cardinal red, on a genuine parchment blessed by the Auditors of the Rota, a copy of Les Diaboliques set up in those lettres de civilité whose peculiar hooks and flourishes, curling up or down, assume a satanic appearance.","This extravagant book pleased Des Esseintes.

"- Ah! s'il en était de même de l'estomac, soupira des Esseintes, tordu par une crampe qui ramenait vivement son esprit égaré au loin, à Fontenay.","- Ah! if it were the same with his stomach, sighed Des Esseintes, writhing with a cramp which quickly brought his wandering mind back to Fontenay.","‘Ah, if only the same were true of my stomach!’ sighed Des Esseintes, as he was suddenly doubled up with a spasm of pain that jolted his thoughts back to Fontenay from the distant regions they had been roaming.","“Ah! if the same were but true of the stomach,” sighed Des Esseintes, racked by a cramp which instantly and sharply brought back his mind, that had roved far off, to Fontenay."
"Cette hypocrisie qui résultait de l'extraordinaire désaccord établi entre le contenant et le contenu, entre le contour liturgique du flacon et son âme, toute féminine, toute moderne, l'avait jadis fait rêver; enfin il avait longuement aussi songé devant cette bouteille aux moines mêmes qui la vendaient, aux bénédictins de l'abbaye de Fécamp qui, appartenant à cette congrégation de Saint-Maur, célèbre par ses travaux d'histoire, militaient sous la règle de saint Benoît, mais ne suivaient point les observances des moines blancs de Cîteaux et des moines noirs de Cluny. Invinciblement, ils lui apparaissaient, ainsi qu'au moyen âge, cultivant des simples, chauffant des cornues, résumant dans des alambics de souveraines panacées, d'incontestables magistères.","This hypocrisy which resulted from the extraordinary disagreement established between the container and the content, between the liturgical outline of the bottle and its very feminine, very modern soul, had once made him dream; finally he had also thought for a long time in front of this bottle of the very monks who sold it, of the Benedictines of the abbey of Fécamp who, belonging to this congregation of Saint-Maur, famous for its works of history, militated under the rule of Saint Benedict , but did not follow the observances of the white monks of Cîteaux and the black monks of Cluny. Invincibly, they appeared to him, as in the Middle Ages, cultivating herbs, heating retorts, summing up in stills sovereign panaceas, indisputable magisteriums.","This hypocrisy resulting from the extraordinary discrepancy between container and contents, between the liturgical form of the bottle and the utterly feminine, utterly modern soul inside it, had set him dreaming before now. Sitting with the bottle in front of him, he had spent hours thinking about the monks who sold it, the Benedictines of the Abbey of Fécamp who, belonging as they did to the congregation of Saint-Maur, famous for its historical researches, were subject to the Rule of St Benedict, yet did not follow the observances of either the white monks of Cîteaux or the black monks of Cluny. They forced themselves upon his imagination, looking just as if they had come straight out of the Middle Ages, growing medicinal herbs, heating retorts, distilling in alembics sovereign cordials, infallible panaceas.","This deceit which resulted from the extraordinary disharmony between contents and container, between the liturgic form of the flask and its so feminine and modern soul, had formerly stimulated Des Esseintes to revery and, facing the bottle, he was inclined to think at great length of the monks who sold it, the Benedictines of the Abbey of Fécamp who, belonging to the brotherhood of Saint-Maur which had been celebrated for its controversial works under the rule of Saint Benoît, followed neither the observances of the white monks of Cîteaux nor of the black monks of Cluny. He could not but think of them as being like their brethren of the Middle Ages, cultivating simples, heating retorts and distilling faultless panaceas and prescriptions."
"À la stupeur d'une foule que ces exercices mettaient mal à l'aise, elle faisait parler, à tour de rôle, des enfants en carton, rangés en flûte de pan, sur des chaises; elle conversait avec des mannequins presque vivants et, dans la salle même, des mouches bourdonnaient autour des lustres et l'on entendait bruire le silencieux public qui s'étonnait d'être assis et se reculait instinctivement dans ses stalles, alors que le roulement d'imaginaires voitures le frôlait, en passant, de l'entrée jusqu'à la scène.","To the stupefaction of a crowd that these exercises made uncomfortable, she made the cardboard children speak, in turn, arranged in panpipes, on chairs; she was conversing with almost living mannequins and, in the room itself, flies were buzzing around the chandeliers and one could hear the rustle of the silent public who were surprised to be seated and instinctively recoiled in their stalls, while the roll of imaginary cars brushed past him, passing, from the entrance to the stage.","To the amazement of a packed audience that was half-frightened by what it heard, she took a set of cardboard puppets perched on chairs like a row of Pandean pipes and gave a voice to each in turn; she conversed with dummies that seemed almost alive, while in the auditorium itself flies could be heard buzzing around and the silent spectators noisily whispering among themselves; finally, she had a line of non-existent carriages rolling up the room from the door to the stage, and passing so close to the audience that they instinctively started back and were momentarily surprised to find themselves sitting indoors.","Before the amazed patrons, she caused her tiny cardboard figures, placed near each other on chairs, to talk; she conversed with the animated mannikins while flies buzzed around the chandeliers.

"Avec ses vaporisateurs, il injecta dans la pièce une essence formée d'ambroisie, de lavande de Mitcham, de pois de senteur, de bouquet, une essence qui, lorsqu'elle est distillée par un artiste, mérite le nom qu'on lui décerne, ""d'extrait de pré fleuri""; puis dans ce pré, il introduisit une précise fusion de tubéreuse, de fleur d'oranger et d'amande, et aussitôt d'artificiels lilas naquirent, tandis que des tilleuls s'éventèrent, rabattant sur le sol leurs pâles émanations que simulait l'extrait du tilia de Londres.","With his vaporizers, he injected into the room an essence formed of ambrosia, Mitcham lavender, sweet pea, bouquet, an essence which, when distilled by an artist, deserves the name given to it. , ""flower meadow extract""; then in this meadow, he introduced a precise fusion of tuberose, orange blossom and almond, and immediately artificial lilacs were born, while lime trees fanned themselves, folding down on the ground their pale emanations which simulated the taken from the London tilia.","With his vaporizers he injected into the room an essence composed of ambrosia, Mitcham lavender, sweet pea and other flowers – an extract which, when it is distilled by a true artist, well merits the name it has been given of ‘extract of meadow blossoms’.

"- Te voilà? reprit-il, voyant Auguste qui rentrait dans le salon et se dérobait, rouge et penaud, derrière la belle Juive. - Allons, gamin, il se fait tard, salue ces dames. Et il lui expliqua dans l'escalier qu'il pourrait, chaque quinzaine, se rendre, sans bourse délier, chez madame Laure; puis, une fois dans la rue, sur le trottoir, regardant l'enfant abasourdi:","- There you are? he went on, seeing Auguste reentering the drawing-room and slipping away, red and sheepish, behind the beautiful Jewess. - Come on, kid, it's getting late, say hello to the ladies. And he explained to her on the stairs that he could, every fortnight, go, without breaking his purse, to Madame Laure; then, once in the street, on the sidewalk, looking at the stunned child:","‘Ah, there you are!’ he exclaimed, as he caught sight of Auguste sneaking back into the room, all red and sheepish, and hiding behind his Jewess. ‘ Come on, my boy, it’s getting late. Say good night to the ladies.’ Going downstairs, he explained to him that once a fortnight he could pay a visit to Madame Laure’s without spending a sou. And then as they stood outside on the pavement, he looked the bewildered child in the face and said:","Although he experienced no inclination for the state of grace, he felt a genuine sympathy for those souls immured in monasteries, persecuted by a vengeful society which can forgive neither the merited scorn with which it inspires them, nor the desire to expiate, to atone by long silences, for the ever growing shamelessness of its ridiculous or trifling gossipings."
"Il but une goutte de cette liqueur et il éprouva, durant quelques minutes, un soulagement; mais bientôt ce feu qu'une larme de vin avait allumé dans ses entrailles, se raviva. Il jeta sa serviette, revint dans son cabinet, se promena de long en large; il lui semblait être sous une cloche pneumatique où le vide se faisait à mesure, et une défaillance d'une douceur atroce lui coulait du cerveau par tous les membres. Il se roidit et, n'y tenant plus, pour la première fois peut-être depuis son arrivée à Fontenay, il se réfugia dans son jardin et s'abrita sous un arbre d'où tombait une rondelle d'ombre. Assis sur le gazon, il regarda, d'un air hébété, les carrés de légumes que les domestiques avaient plantés. Il les regardait et ce ne fut qu'au bout d'une heure qu'il les aperçut, car un brouillard verdâtre flottait devant ses yeux et ne lui laissait voir, comme au fond de l'eau, que des images indécises dont l'aspect et les tons changeaient.","He drank a drop of this liquor and for a few minutes he felt relieved; but soon that fire which a tear of wine had kindled in his entrails revived. He threw down his napkin, returned to his study, walked up and down; it seemed to him to be under a pneumatic bell where the vacuum was made gradually, and a weakness of an atrocious softness flowed from his brain by all the members. He stiffened up and, unable to bear it any longer, perhaps for the first time since his arrival in Fontenay, he took refuge in his garden and took shelter under a tree from which fell a slice of shadow. Sitting on the grass, he gazed dazedly at the squares of vegetables the servants had planted. He was looking at them and it was only after an hour that he saw them, for a greenish mist floated before his eyes and only allowed him to see, as at the bottom of the water, only indecisive images whose appearance and tones changed.","He took a sip of the liqueur and felt a little better for a minute or two; but soon the fire a drop of wine had kindled in his innards blazed up again. He threw down his napkin and went back into his study, where he began pacing up and down; he felt as if he were under the receiver of an air-pump in which a vacuum was being gradually created, and a dangerously pleasant lethargy spread from his brain into every limb. Unable to stand any more of this, he pulled himself together and, for perhaps the first time since his coming to Fontenay, sought refuge in the garden, where he took shelter in the patch of shadow cast by a tree. Sitting on the grass, he gazed vacantly at the rows of vegetables the servants had planted. But it was only after an hour’s gazing that he realized what they were, for a greenish mist floated before his eyes, preventing him from seeing anything more than blurred, watery images which kept changing colour and appearance.","He tasted a drop of this liquor and, for a few moments, had relief. But soon the fire, which the dash of wine had lit in his bowels, revived. He threw down his napkin, returned to his study, and paced the floor. He felt as if he were under a pneumatic clock, and a numbing weakness stole from his brain through his limbs. Unable to endure it longer, he betook himself to the garden. It was the first time he had done this since his arrival at Fontenay. There he found shelter beneath a tree which radiated a circle of shadow. Seated on the lawn, he looked around with a besotted air at the square beds of vegetables planted by the servants. He gazed, but it was only at the end of an hour that he really saw them, for a greenish film floated before his eyes, permitting him only to see, as in the depths of water, flickering images of shifting tones."
"Aussi devait-il se modérer, toucher à peine à ces redoutables élixirs, de même qu'il ne pouvait plus visiter impunément son rouge vestibule et s'enivrer la vue des ténèbres d'Odilon Redon et des supplices de Jan Luyken.","So he had to moderate himself, hardly touch those formidable elixirs, just as he could no longer visit his red vestibule with impunity and intoxicate himself at the sight of the shadows of Odilon Redon and the tortures of Jan Luyken.","He therefore had to hold himself in check and only rarely indulge in these formidable elixirs, just as he could no longer visit with impunity his red entrance-hall and feast his eyes on the horrors of Odilon Redon and the tortures of Jan Luyken.","Thus he was compelled to moderate his desires, and he rarely touched these fearful elixirs, in the same way that he could no longer with impunity visit his red corridor and grow ecstatic at the sight of the gloomy Odilon Redon prints and the Jan Luyken horrors."
"Eh! croule donc, société! meurs donc, vieux monde! s'écria des Esseintes, indigné par l'ignominie du spectacle qu'il évoquait; ce cri rompit le cauchemar qui l'opprimait","Hey! therefore crumbles, society! so die, old world! exclaimed Des Esseintes, indignant at the ignominy of the spectacle he evoked; this cry broke the nightmare that oppressed him","‘Well, crumble then, society! perish, old world!’ cried Des Esseintes, roused to indignation by the ignominious spectacle he had conjured up – and the sound of his voice broke the oppressive spell the nightmare had laid on him.","“Well, then, society, crash to ruin! Die, aged world!” cried Des Esseintes, angered by the ignominy of the spectacle he had evoked. This cry of hate broke the nightmare that oppressed him."
"Il était d'ailleurs temps de se résoudre ; le compte qu'il fit de sa fortune l'épouvanta ; en folies, en noces, il avait dévoré la majeure partie de son patrimoine, et l'autre partie, placée en terres, ne rapportait que des intérêts dérisoires.","Besides, it was time to make up its mind; the account he made of his fortune terrified him; in follies, in weddings, he had devoured the greater part of his patrimony, and the other part, invested in land, brought in only derisory interest.","Besides, there was another reason why he should lose no time in coming to a decision: taking stock of his fortune, he discovered to his horror that in extravagant follies and riotous living he had squandered the greater part of his patrimony, and that what remained was invested in land and brought in only a paltry revenue.","It was time to make up his mind. The condition of his finances terrified him. He had spent, in acts of folly and in drinking bouts, the greater part of his patrimony, and the remainder, invested in land, produced a ridiculously small income."
"Enfin au Ve siècle, Augustin, évêque d'Hippone. Celui-là, des Esseintes ne le connaissait que trop, car il était l'écrivain le plus réputé de l'église, le fondateur de l'orthodoxie chrétienne, celui que les catholiques considèrent comme un oracle, comme un souverain maître. Aussi ne l'ouvrait-il plus, bien qu'il eût chanté, dans ses Confessions, le dégoût de la terre et que sa piété gémissante eût, dans sa Cité de Dieu, essayé d'apaiser l'effroyable détresse du siècle par les sédatives promesses de destinées meilleures. Au temps où il pratiquait la théologie, il était déjà las, saoul de ses prédications et de ses jérémiades, de ses théories sur la prédestination et sur la grâce, de ses combats contre les schismes.","Finally in the 5th century, Augustine, bishop of Hippo. Des Esseintes knew him only too well, for he was the most famous writer in the Church, the founder of Christian orthodoxy, the one whom Catholics regard as an oracle, as a sovereign master. So he no longer opened it, although he had sung, in his Confessions, the disgust of the earth and his groaning piety had, in his City of God, tried to appease the terrible distress of the century by the sedatives promise better destinies. At the time when he practiced theology, he was already weary, drunk with his preaching and his jeremiads, with his theories on predestination and on grace, with his combats against schisms.","Finally, in the fifth century, there comes Augustine, Bishop of Hippo. Him Des Esseintes knew only too well, for he was the most revered of all ecclesiastical writers, the founder of Christian orthodoxy, the man whom pious Catholics regard as an oracle, a sovereign authority. The natural consequence was that he never opened his books any more, even though he had proclaimed his loathing for this world in his Confessions, and, in his De Civitate Dei, to the accompaniment of pious groans, had tried to assuage the appalling distress of his time with sedative promises of better things to come in the afterlife. Even in his younger days, when he was studying theology, Des Esseintes had become sick and tired of Augustine’s sermons and jeremiads, his theories on grace and predestination, his fights against the schismatic sects.","Finally, in the fifth century came Augustine, bishop of Hippo. Des Esseintes knew him only too well, for he was the Church's most reputed writer, founder of Christian orthodoxy, considered an oracle and sovereign master by Catholics. He no longer opened the pages of this holy man's works, although he had sung his disgust of the earth in the Confessions, and although his lamenting piety had essayed, in the City of God, to mitigate the frightful distress of the times by sedative promises of a rosier future. When Des Esseintes had studied theology, he was already sick and weary of the old monk's preachings and jeremiads, his theories on predestination and grace, his combats against the schisms."
"Il n'avait plus que le temps de courir à la gare, et une immense aversion pour le voyage, un impérieux besoin de rester tranquille s'imposaient avec une volonté de plus en plus accusée, de plus en plus tenace. Pensif, il laissa s'écouler les minutes, se coupant ainsi la retraite, se disant: Maintenant il faudrait se précipiter aux guichets, se bousculer aux bagages; quel ennui! quelle corvée ça serait! - Puis, se répétant, une fois de plus: En somme, j'ai éprouvé et j'ai vu ce que je voulais éprouver et voir. Je suis saturé de vie anglaise depuis mon départ; il faudrait être fou pour aller perdre, par un maladroit déplacement, d'impérissables sensations. Enfin quelle aberration ai-je donc eue pour avoir tenté de renier des idées anciennes, pour avoir condamné les dociles fantasmagories de ma cervelle, pour avoir, ainsi qu'un véritable béjaune, cru à la nécessité, à la curiosité, à l'intérêt d'une excursion? - Tiens, fit-il, regardant sa montre, mais l'heure est venue de rentrer au logis; cette fois, il se dressa sur ses jambes, sortit, commanda au cocher de le reconduire à la gare de Sceaux, et il revint avec ses malles, ses paquets, ses valises, ses couvertures, ses parapluies et ses cannes, à Fontenay, ressentant l'éreintement physique et la fatigue morale d'un homme qui rejoint son chez soi, après un long et périlleux voyage.","He only had time to run to the station, and an immense aversion to travel, an imperious need to remain calm imposed themselves with a more and more marked will, more and more tenacious. Thoughtful, he let the minutes go by, thus cutting his retreat, saying to himself: Now we must rush to the counters, rush to the luggage; That's so boring! what a chore that would be! - Then, repeating himself, once more: In short, I experienced and saw what I wanted to experience and see. I have been saturated with English life since my departure; one would have to be mad to go and lose, by a clumsy displacement, imperishable sensations. Finally, what aberration did I have for having tried to renounce old ideas, for having condemned the docile phantasmagoria of my brain, for having, like a real silly, believed in the necessity, in the of an excursion? - Well, he said, looking at his watch, but the time has come to go home; this time he got up on his feet, went out, ordered the coachman to take him back to the Sceaux station, and he returned with his trunks, parcels, suitcases, blankets, umbrellas and walking sticks, to Fontenay, feeling the physical exhaustion and moral fatigue of a man returning home after a long and perilous journey.","Now he had only just time enough to run across to the station, but an immense aversion for the journey, an urgent longing to remain where he was, came over him with growing force and intensity. Lost in thought, he sat there letting the minutes slip by, thus cutting off his retreat. ‘If I went now,’ he said to himself, ‘I should have to dash up to the barriers and hustle the porters along with my luggage. What a tiresome business it would be!’ And once again he told himself: ‘When you come to think of it, I’ve seen and felt all that I wanted to see and feel. I’ve been steeped in English life ever since I left home, and it would be madness to risk spoiling such unforgettable experiences by a clumsy change of locality.5 As it is, I must have been suffering from some mental aberration to have thought of repudiating my old convictions, to have rejected the visions of my obedient imagination and to have believed like any ninny that it was necessary, interesting and useful to travel abroad.’ He looked at his watch. ‘Time to go home,’ he said. And this time he managed to get to his feet, left the tavern and told the cabby to drive him back to the Gare de Sceaux. Thence he returned to Fontenay with his trunks, his packages, his portmanteaux, his rugs, his umbrellas and his sticks, feeling all the physical weariness and moral fatigue of a man who has come home after a long and perilous journey.","He had but sufficient time to race to the station. An overwhelming aversion for the trip, an imperious need of remaining tranquil, seized him with a more and more obvious and stubborn strength. Pensively, he let the minutes pass, thus cutting off all retreat, and he said to himself, “Now it would be necessary to rush to the gate and crowd into the baggage room! What ennui! What a bore that would be!” Then he repeated to himself once more, “In fine, I have experienced and seen all I wished to experience and see. I have been filled with English life since my departure. I would be mad indeed to go and, by an awkward trip, lose those imperishable sensations. How stupid of me to have sought to disown my old ideas, to have doubted the efficacy of the docile phantasmagories of my brain, like a very fool to have thought of the necessity, of the curiosity, of the interest of an excursion!” “Well!” he exclaimed, consulting his watch, “it is now time to return home.” This time, he arose and left, ordered the driver to bring him back to the Sceaux station, and returned with his trunks, packages, valises, rugs, umbrellas and canes, to Fontenay, feeling the physical stimulation and the moral fatigue of a man coming back to his home after a long and dangerous voyage."
"Quelle singulière époque, se disait des Esseintes, que celle qui, tout en invoquant les intérêts de l'humanité, cherche à perfectionner les anesthésiques pour supprimer la souffrance physique et prépare, en même temps, de tels stimulants pour aggraver la douleur morale!","What a singular epoch, des Esseintes said to himself, that which, while invoking the interests of humanity, sought to perfect anesthetics to suppress physical suffering and at the same time prepared such stimulants to aggravate moral pain!","What a peculiar age this was, Des Esseintes thought to himself, which, ostensibly in the interests of humanity, strove to perfect anaesthetics in order to do away with physical suffering, and at the same time concocted stimulants such as this to aggravate moral suffering!","Des Esseintes wondered if there had ever been such a time as ours. Our age invokes the causes of humanity, endeavors to perfect anæsthesia to suppress physical suffering. Yet at the same time it prepares these very stimulants to increase moral wretchedness."
"La mort dont tous les dramaturges avaient tant abusé, il l'avait, en quelque sorte, aiguisée, rendue autre, en y introduisant un élément algébrique et surhumain; mais c'était, à vrai dire, moins l'agonie réelle du moribond qu'il décrivait, que l'agonie morale du survivant hanté, devant le lamentable lit, par les monstrueuses hallucinations qu'engendrent la douleur et la fatigue. Avec une fascination atroce, il s'appesantissait sur les actes de l'épouvante, sur les craquements de la volonté, les raisonnait froidement, serrant peu à peu la gorge du lecteur, suffoqué, pantelant devant ces cauchemars mécaniquement agencés de fièvre chaude.","Death, which all the playwrights had abused so much, he had, in a way, sharpened it, rendered different, by introducing into it an algebraic and superhuman element; but it was, to tell the truth, less the real agony of the dying person he was describing than the moral agony of the survivor haunted, before the lamentable bed, by the monstrous hallucinations engendered by pain and fatigue. With an atrocious fascination, he dwelled on the acts of terror, on the cracks of the will, reasoned them coldly, squeezing the reader's throat little by little, suffocated, panting before these mechanically arranged nightmares of hot fever.","As for death, which the dramatists had so grossly abused, he had in a way given it a sharper edge, a new look, by introducing into it an algebraic and superhuman element; though to tell the truth, it was not so much the physical agony of the dying he described as the moral agony of the survivor, haunted beside the death-bed by the monstrous hallucinations engendered by grief and fatigue. With awful fascination he dwelt on the effects of terror, on the failures of will-power, and discussed them with clinical objectivity, making the reader’s flesh creep, his throat contract, his mouth go dry at the recital of these mechanically devised nightmares of a fevered brain.","Death, which the dramatists had so much abused, he had in some manner changed and made more poignant, by introducing an algebraic and superhuman element; but in truth, it was less the real agony of the dying person which he described and more the moral agony of the survivor, haunted at the death bed by monstrous hallucinations engendered by grief and fatigue. With a frightful fascination, he dwelt on acts of terror, on the snapping of the will, coldly reasoning about them, little by little making the reader gasp, suffocated and panting before these feverish mechanically contrived nightmares."
"En négligeant, en effet, le commun des hommes dont les grossières rétines ne perçoivent ni la cadence propre à chacune des couleurs, ni le charme mystérieux de leurs dégradations et de leurs nuances; en négligeant aussi ces yeux bourgeois, insensibles à la pompe et à la victoire des teintes vibrantes et fortes; en ne conservant plus alors que les gens aux pupilles raffinées, exercées par la littérature et par l'art, il lui semblait certain que l'oeil de celui d'entre eux qui rêve d'idéal, qui réclame des illusions, sollicite des voiles dans le coucher, est généralement caressé par le bleu et ses dérivés, tels que le mauve, le lilas, le gris de perle, pourvu toutefois qu'ils demeurent attendris et ne dépassent pas la lisière où il aliènent leur personnalité et se transforment en de purs violets, en de francs gris.","By neglecting, in fact, the common people whose coarse retinas perceive neither the cadence proper to each of the colors, nor the mysterious charm of their degradations and their nuances; neglecting also those bourgeois eyes, insensitive to the pomp and victory of vibrant and strong tints; by retaining only people with refined pupils, exercised by literature and art, it seemed to him certain that the eye of those among them who dream of ideals, who demand illusions, solicit veils in the sunset, is generally caressed by blue and its derivatives, such as mauve, lilac, pearl gray, provided however that they remain softened and do not exceed the edge where they alienate their personality and are transformed into de pure violets, in frank grays.","In fact, leaving out of account the majority of men, whose coarse retinas perceive neither the cadences peculiar to different colours nor the mysterious charm of their gradation; leaving out also those bourgeois optics that are insensible to the pomp and glory of the clear, bright colours; and considering only those people with delicate eyes that have undergone the education of libraries and art-galleries, it seemed to him an undeniable fact that anyone who dreams of the ideal, prefers illusion to reality and calls for veils to clothe the naked truth, is almost certain to appreciate the soothing caress of blue and its cognates, such as mauve, lilac and pearl grey, always provided they retain their delicacy and do not pass the point where they change their personalities and turn into pure violets and stark greys.","Disregarding entirely the generality of men whose gross retinas are capable of perceiving neither the cadence peculiar to each color nor the mysterious charm of their nuances of light and shade; ignoring the bourgeoisie, whose eyes are insensible to the pomp and splendor of strong, vibrant tones; and devoting himself only to people with sensitive pupils, refined by literature and art, he was convinced that the eyes of those among them who dream of the ideal and demand illusions are generally caressed by blue and its derivatives, mauve, lilac and pearl grey, provided always that these colors remain soft and do not overstep the bounds where they lose their personalities by being transformed into pure violets and frank greys."
"En littérature, il avait, le premier, sous ce titre emblématique: ""Le démon de la Perversité"", épié ces impulsions irrésistibles que la volonté subit sans les connaître et que la pathologie cérébrale explique maintenant d'une façon à peu près sûre; le premier aussi, il avait sinon signalé, du moins divulgué l'influence dépressive de la peur qui agit sur la volonté, de même que les anesthésiques qui paralysent la sensibilité et que le curare qui anéantit les éléments nerveux moteurs; c'était sur ce point, sur cette léthargie de la volonté, qu'il avait fait converger ses études, analysant les effets de ce poison moral, indiquant les symptômes de sa marche, les troubles commençant avec l'anxiété, se continuant par l'angoisse, éclatant enfin dans la terreur qui stupéfie les volitions, sans que l'intelligence, bien qu'ébranlée, fléchisse.","In literature, he was the first, under this emblematic title: ""The Demon of Perversity"", to spy on those irresistible impulses which the will undergoes without knowing them and which cerebral pathology now explains in a more or less sure way; the first too, he had if not pointed out, at least divulged the depressing influence of fear which acts on the will, just as the anesthetics which paralyze sensibility and curare which annihilates the motor nervous elements; it was on this point, on this lethargy of the will, that he had made his studies converge, analyzing the effects of this moral poison, indicating the symptoms of its progress, the troubles beginning with anxiety, continuing with anxiety. anguish, finally bursting into the terror which stupefies the volitions, without the intelligence, although shaken, weakening.","In literature he had been the first, under the emblematic title The Imp of the Perverse, to study those irresistible impulses which the will submits to without fully understanding them, and which cerebral pathology can now explain with a fair degree of certainty; he had been the first again, if not to point out, at least to make known the depressing influence fear has on the will, which it affects in the same way as anaesthetics which paralyse the senses and curare which cripples the motory nerves. It was on this last subject, this lethargy of the will, that he had concentrated his studies, analysing the effects of this moral poison and indicating the symptoms of its progress – mental disturbances beginning with anxiety, developing into anguish and finally culminating in a terror that stupefies the faculties of volition, yet without the intellect, however badly shaken it may be, giving way.","Under the emblematic title, The Demon of Perversity, he had been the first in literature to pry into the irresistible, unconscious impulses of the will which mental pathology now explains more scientifically. He had also been the first to divulge, if not to signal the impressive influence of fear which acts on the will like an anæsthetic, paralyzing sensibility and like the curare, stupefying the nerves. It was on the problem of the lethargy of the will, that Poe had centered his studies, analyzing the effects of this moral poison, indicating the symptoms of its progress, the troubles commencing with anxiety, continuing through anguish, ending finally in the terror which deadens the will without intelligence succumbing, though sorely disturbed."
Quelle folie que de procréer des gosses! pensait des Esseintes. Et dire que les ecclésiastiques qui ont fait voeu de stérilité ont poussé l'inconséquence jusqu'à canoniser saint Vincent de Paul parce qu'il réservait pour d'inutiles tortures des innocents!,What madness to procreate kids! thought Des Esseintes. And to think that the ecclesiastics who took a vow of sterility pushed the inconsistency so far as to canonize Saint Vincent de Paul because he reserved innocents for useless tortures!,"What madness it was to beget children, reflected Des Esseintes. And to think that the priestery, who had taken a vow of sterility, had carried inconsistency to the point of canonizing St Vincent de Paul because he saved innocent babes for useless torments!","How vain, silly and mad it is to beget brats! And Des Esseintes thought of those ecclesiastics who had taken vows of sterility, yet were so inconsistent as to canonize Saint Vincent de Paul, because he brought vain tortures to innocent creatures."
"Il était, depuis des années, habile dans la science du flair; il pensait que l'odorat pouvait éprouver des jouissances égales à celles de l'ouïe et de la vue, chaque sens étant susceptible, par suite d'une disposition naturelle et d'une érudite culture, de percevoir des impressions nouvelles, de les décupler, de les coordonner, d'en composer ce tout qui constitue une oeuvre; et il n'était pas, en somme, plus anormal qu'un art existât, en dégageant d'odorants fluides, que d'autres, en détachant des ondes sonores, ou en frappant de rayons diversement colorés la rétine d'un oeil; seulement, si personne ne peut discerner, sans une intuition particulière développée par l'étude, une peinture de grand maître d'une croûte, un air de Beethoven d'un air de Clapisson, personne, non plus, ne peut, sans une initiation préalable, ne point confondre, au premier abord, un bouquet créé par un sincère artiste, avec un pot-pourri fabriqué par un industriel, pour la vente des épiceries et des bazars.","He had been, for years, skilled in the science of flair; he thought that the sense of smell could experience pleasures equal to those of hearing and sight, each sense being capable, as a result of a natural disposition and a scholarly culture, of perceiving new impressions, of multiplying them tenfold. , to coordinate them, to compose this whole which constitutes a work; and it was not, on the whole, more abnormal that an art existed, by disengaging fluid odorants, than others, by detaching sonorous waves, or by striking rays of various colors on the retina of an eye; only, if no one can discern, without a particular intuition developed by study, a painting by a great master from a crust, an air by Beethoven from an air by Clapisson, no one, either, can, without an initiation prior, do not confuse, at first glance, a bouquet created by a sincere artist, with a potpourri made by an industrialist, for sale in grocery stores and bazaars.","For years now he had been an expert in the science of perfumes;1 he maintained that the sense of smell could procure pleasures equal to those obtained through sight or hearing, each of the senses being capable, by virtue of a natural aptitude supplemented by an erudite education, of perceiving new impressions, magnifying these tenfold and co-ordinating them to compose the whole that constitutes a work of art. After all, he argued, it was no more abnormal to have an art that consisted of picking out odorous fluids than it was to have other arts based on a selection of sound waves or the impact of variously coloured rays on the retina of the eye; only, just as no one, without a special intuitive faculty developed by study, could distinguish a painting by a great master from a paltry daub, or a Beethoven theme from a tune by Clapisson, so no one, without a preliminary initiation, could help confusing at first a bouquet created by a true artist with a potpourri concocted by a manufacturer for sale in grocers’ shops and cheap bazaars.","He had long been skilled in the science of smell. He believed that this sense could give one delights equal to those of hearing and sight; each sense being susceptible, if naturally keen and if properly cultivated, to new impressions, which it could intensify, coordinate and compose into that unity which constitutes a creative work. And it was not more abnormal and unnatural that an art should be called into existence by disengaging odors than that another art should be evoked by detaching sound waves or by striking the eye with diversely colored rays. But if no person could discern, without intuition developed by study, a painting by a master from a daub, a melody of Beethoven from one by Clapisson, no more could any one at first, without preliminary initiation, help confusing a bouquet invented by a sincere artist with a pot pourri made by some manufacturer to be sold in groceries and bazaars."
"Tout disparut dans la poussière des galops, dans la fumée des incendies. Les ténèbres se firent et les peuples consternés tremblèrent, écoutant passer, avec un fracas de tonnerre, l'épouvantable trombe. La horde des Huns rasa l'Europe, se rua sur la Gaule, s'écrasa dans les plaines de Châlons où Aétius la pila dans une effroyable charge. La plaine, gorgée de sang, moutonna comme une mer de pourpre, deux cent mille cadavres barrèrent la route, brisèrent l'élan de cette avalanche qui, déviée, tomba, éclatant en coups de foudre, sur l'Italie où les villes exterminées flambèrent comme des meules.","Everything disappeared in the dust of the gallops, in the smoke of the fires.

"Les autres, élevés dans les collèges de l'État ou dans les lycées, étaient moins hypocrites et plus libres, mais ils n'étaient ni plus intéressants, ni moins étroits.

"Ce travail de sélection s'était lentement opéré en lui; il avait naguère adoré le grand Balzac, mais en même temps que son organisme s'était déséquilibré, que ses nerfs avaient pris le dessus, ses inclinations s'étaient modifiées et ses admirations avaient changé. Bientôt même, et quoiqu'il se rendît compte de son injustice envers le prodigieux auteur de La Comédie humaine, il en était venu à ne plus ouvrir ses livres dont l'art valide le froissait; d'autres aspirations l'agitaient maintenant, qui devenaient, en quelque sorte, indéfinissables.","This work of selection had slowly taken place in him; he had once adored the great Balzac, but at the same time that his organism had become unbalanced, his nerves had taken over, his inclinations had changed and his admirations had changed.

"Cet état psychique, Barbey d'Aurevilly le côtoyait. S'il n'allait pas aussi loin que de Sade, en proférant d'atroces malédictions contre le Sauveur; si, plus prudent ou plus craintif, il prétendait toujours honorer l'église, il n'en adressait pas moins, comme au moyen âge, ses postulations au Diable et il glissait, lui aussi, afin d'affronter Dieu, à l'érotomanie démoniaque, forgeant des monstruosités sensuelles, empruntant même à La Philosophie dans le boudoir un certain épisode qu'il assaisonnait de nouveaux condiments, lorsqu'il écrivait ce conte: Le Dîner d'un athée.","This psychic state, Barbey d'Aurevilly rubbed shoulders with him.

If he did not presume as far as De Sade in uttering atrocious curses against the Saviour; if, more prudent or more timid, he claimed ever to honor the Church, he none the less addressed his suit to the Devil as was done in medieval times and he, too, in order to brave God, fell into demoniac nymphomania, inventing sensual monstrosities, even borrowing from bedroom philosophy a certain episode which he seasoned with new condiments when he wrote the story le Dîner d'un athée."
"L'héroïne de ce livre, une marquise Tullia Fabriana, qui était censée s'être assimilé la science chaldéenne des femmes d'Edgar Poe et les sagacités diplomatiques de la Sanseverina-Taxis de Stendhal, s'était, en sus, composé l'énigmatique contenance d'une Bradamante mâtinée d'une Circé antique.

"D'autres fois, il composait lui-même des mélodies, exécutait des pastorales avec le bénin cassis qui lui faisait roulader, dans la gorge, des chants emperlés de rossignol, avec le tendre cacao-chouva qui fredonnait de sirupeuses bergerades, telles que ""les romances d'Estelle"" et les ""Ah! vous dirai-je, maman"" du temps jadis.","At other times, he composed melodies himself, performed pastorals with the benign blackcurrant which made pearly nightingale songs roll in his throat, with the tender cacao-chouva which hummed syrupy bergerades, such as "" the romances of Estelle"" and the ""Ah! I will tell you, mother"" of the past.","At other times he would compose melodies of his own, executing pastorals with the sweet blackcurrant liqueur that filled his throat with the warbling song of a nightingale; or with the delicious cacaochouva that hummed sugary bergerets like the Romances of Estelle and the ‘Ah! vous dirai-je, maman’ of olden days.","At other times, he himself composed melodies, executed pastorals with mild black-currant which evoked, in his throat, the trillings of nightingales; with the tender chouva cocoa which sang saccharine songs like “The romance of Estelle” and the “Ah!

"Là, très ébahi, Auguste avait regardé, en pétrissant le drap de sa casquette, un bataillon de femmes dont les bouches peintes s'ouvrirent toutes ensemble - Ah le môme! Tiens, il est gentil!","There, very dumbfounded, Auguste had watched, kneading the sheet of his cap, a battalion of women whose painted mouths all opened together - Ah the kid! Hey, he's nice!","There a wonderstruck Auguste, twisting his cap in his hands, had stood gaping at a battalion of women whose painted mouths opened all together to exclaim: ‘What a duck! Isn’t he sweet!’","Although he experienced no inclination for the state of grace, he felt a genuine sympathy for those souls immured in monasteries, persecuted by a vengeful society which can forgive neither the merited scorn with which it inspires them, nor the desire to expiate, to atone by long silences, for the ever growing shamelessness of its ridiculous or trifling gossipings."
"Puis il entrait, avec elles, en complète communion d'idées avec les écrivains qui les avaient conçues, parce qu'ils s'étaient alors trouvés dans une situation d'esprit analogue à la sienne.","Then he entered, with them, into complete communion of ideas with the writers who had conceived them, because they had then found themselves in a situation of mind analogous to his own.","And then, reading these works, he could enter into complete intellectual fellowship with the writers who had conceived them, because at the moment of conception those writers had been in a state of mind analogous to his own.",In them he entered into a perfect communion of ideas with their authors who had written them when their state of soul was analogous to his own.
"Arrivé devant la maison, reconnaissable à un immense écriteau de bois noir où le nom de ""Gatonax"" s'étalait en d'énormes lettres couleur de potiron, et en deux petites armoires vitrées où des dents de pâte étaient soigneusement alignées dans des gencives de cire rose, reliées entre elles par des ressorts mécaniques de laiton, il haleta, la sueur aux tempes; une transe horrible lui vint, un frisson lui glissa sur la peau, un apaisement eut lieu, la souffrance s'arrêta, la dent se tut.","Arrived in front of the house, recognizable by a huge black wooden sign on which the name ""Gatonax"" was spread out in enormous pumpkin-colored letters, and by two small glass cabinets where dough teeth were carefully aligned in gums of pink wax, linked together by mechanical brass springs, he gasped, the sweat at his temples; a horrible trance came to him, a shiver slipped over his skin, an appeasement took place, the suffering stopped, the tooth was silent.","Soon he arrived at the house, which was distinguished by an enormous wooden placard bearing the name ‘Gatonax’ spread out in huge yellow letters on a black ground, and by two little glass-fronted cases displaying neat rows of false teeth set in pink wax gums joined together with brass springs.

"Un autre être existait encore, en lui: cet esprit se dédoublait, et, après l'endroit apparaissait l'envers de l'écrivain, un fanatique religieux et un prophète biblique.","Another being still existed, in him: this spirit split, and, after the place appeared the other side of the writer, a religious fanatic and a biblical prophet.","There was another person in him, another side to his dual nature – and this was the religious fanatic, the biblical prophet.","Still another existed. This mind divided itself in two parts and revealed, besides the writer, the religious fanatic and Biblical prophet."
"Ce n'était plus l'horizon immense ouvert par les inoubliables portes de Baudelaire, c'était, sous un clair de lune, une fente entrebâillée sur un champ plus restreint et plus intime, en somme particulier à l'auteur qui avait, du reste, en ces vers dont des Esseintes était friand, formulé son système poétique: Car nous voulons la nuance encore, Pas la couleur, rien que la nuance … … … … … … Et tout le reste est littérature.","It was no longer the immense horizon opened by the unforgettable doors of Baudelaire, it was, under a moonlight, a half-open crack on a more restricted and more intimate field, in short particular to the author who had, remains, in these verses of which Des Esseintes was fond, formulated his poetic system: For we still want nuance, Not color, nothing but nuance … … … … … … And all the rest is literature.","si spécieux , tout bas, Que notre âme depuis ce temps tremble et s’étonne.6 This was not the vast horizon revealed through the portals of Baudelaire’s unforgettable poetry, but rather a glimpse of a moonlit scene, a more limited, intimate view peculiar to the author who, incidentally, had formulated his poetic method in a few lines of which Des Esseintes was particularly fond: Car nous voulons la nuance encore, Pas la couleur, rien que la nuance … Et tout le reste est littérature.7","It was no longer the immense horizon opened by the unforgettable portals of Baudelaire; it was a crevice in the moonlight, opening on a field which was more intimate and more restrained, peculiar to Verlaine who had formulated his poetic system in those lines of which Des Esseintes was so fond: Car nous voulons la nuance encore, Pas la couleur, rien que la nuance. Et tout le reste est litterature."
"Il sonna son domestique: - Vous ne sentez rien, dit-il?

"Puis, il s'étendit sur un canapé, près de la femme dont l'immobile figure était atteinte par la lueur d'un tison, et il attendit.","Then he lay down on a sofa, near the woman whose motionless face was touched by the glow of a brand, and he waited.","This done, he lay down on the bed beside the ventriloquist, whose set face was lit up by the glow of a half-burned log, and waited.","Then he stretched out on a couch beside the woman whose motionless figure was touched by the ember gleams, and waited."
"Et pourtant, se disait-il, il y a des gens qui vivent solitaires, sans parler à personne, qui s'absorbent à l'écart du monde, tels que les réclusionnaires et les trappistes, et rien ne prouve que ces malheureux et que ces sages deviennent des déments ou des phtisiques. Ces exemples, il les avait cités au docteur sans résultat; celui-ci avait répété d'un ton sec et qui n'admettait plus aucune réplique, que son verdict, d'ailleurs confirmé par l'avis de tous les nosographes de la névrose, était que la distraction, que l'amusement, que la joie, pouvaient seuls influer sur cette maladie dont tout le côté spirituel échappait à la force chimique des remèdes; et, impatienté par les récriminations de son malade, il avait, une dernière fois, déclaré qu'il se refusait à lui continuer ses soins s'il ne consentait pas à changer d'air, à vivre dans de nouvelles conditions d'hygiène.","And yet, he said to himself, there are people who live alone, without speaking to anyone, who absorb themselves apart from the world, such as the recluses and the Trappists, and nothing proves that these unfortunates and that these sages become lunatics or consumptives.

Finally, infuriated by his patient’s recriminations, he had stated once for all that he refused to go on treating him unless he agreed to a change of air and a move to more hygienic conditions.","Yet he told himself there were people who live without conversing with anyone, absorbed far from the world in their own affairs, like recluses and trappists, and there is nothing to prove that these wretches and sages become madmen or consumptives.

"Au demeurant, la décomposition de la langue française s'était faite d'un coup. Dans la langue latine, une longue transition, un écart de quatre cents ans existait entre le verbe tacheté et superbe de Claudien et de Rutilius, et le verbe faisandé du VIIIe siècle.

"On descendait des voitures une nouvelle fournée de monstres: des Echinopsis, sortant de compresses en ouate des fleurs d'un rose de moignon ignoble; des Nidularium, ouvrant, dans des lames de sabres, des fondements écorchés et béants; des ""Tillandsia Lindeni"" tirant des grattoirs ébréchés, couleur de moût de vin; des Cypripedium, aux contours compliqués, incohérents, imaginés par un inventeur en démence. Ils ressemblaient à un sabot, à un vide-poche, au-dessus duquel se retrousserait une langue humaine, au filet tendu, telle qu'on en voit dessinées sur les planches des ouvrages traitant des affections de la gorge et de la bouche; deux petites ailettes, rouge de jujube, qui paraissaient empruntées à un moulin d'enfant, complétaient ce baroque assemblage d'un dessous de langue, couleur de lie et d'ardoise, et d'une pochette lustrée dont la doublure suintait une visqueuse colle.","A new batch of monsters were getting out of the cars: Echinopsis, emerging from wadding compresses from the flowers of an ignoble stump pink; Nidularium, opening, in the blades of sabers, flayed and gaping foundations; ""Tillandsia Lindeni"" pulling chipped scrapers, the color of wine must; Cypripediums, with complicated, incoherent contours, imagined by an inventor in dementia. They resembled a sabot, a trinket, above which curled up a human tongue, with a stretched net, such as one sees drawn on the plates of works treating of the affections of the throat and the mouth; two small wings, jujube red, which seemed borrowed from a child's mill, completed this baroque assembly of a tongue underside, the color of lees and slate, and a glossy pocket whose lining oozed a viscous glue .","Now they were getting a fresh batch of monstrosities down from the carts – the Echinopsis, thrusting its ghastly pink blossoms out of cotton-wool compresses, like the stumps of amputated limbs; the Nidularium, opening its sword-shaped petals to reveal gaping flesh-wounds; the Tillandsia Lindeni, trailing its jagged plough-shares the colour of wine-must; and the Cypripedium, with its complex, incoherent contours devised by some demented draughtsman.

"Partie de Pétrone, sa collection latine entrait dans le IIe siècle de l'ère chrétienne, sautait le déclamateur Fronton, aux termes surannés, mal réparés, mal revernis, enjambait les Nuits attiques d'Aulu-Gelle, son disciple et ami, un esprit sagace et fureteur, mais un écrivain empêtré dans une glutineuse vase et elle faisait halte devant Apulée dont il gardait l'édition princeps, in-folio, imprimée en 1469, à Rome.","Starting from Petronius, his Latin collection entered the second century of the Christian era, skipped the declaimer Fronton, with outdated, badly repaired, badly varnished terms, spanned the Attic Nights of Aulu-Gelle, his disciple and friend, a spirit sagacious and fervent, but a writer entangled in a sticky slime and she halted in front of Apuleius, of which he kept the princeps edition, in folio, printed in 1469, in Rome.","After Petronius, his collection of Latin authors came to the second century of the Christian era, skipped tub-thumping Fronto with his old-fashioned expressions, clumsily restored and unsuccessfully renovated, passed over the Noctes Atticae of his friend and disciple Aulus Gellius, a sagacious and inquisitive mind, but a writer bogged down in a glutinous style, and stopped only for Apuleius, whose works he had in the editio princeps, in folio, printed at Rome in 1469.","Leaving Petronius, his Latin collection entered into the second century of the Christian era, passed over Fronto, the declaimer, with his antiquated terms; skipped the Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius, his disciple and friend,—a clever, ferreting mind, but a writer entangled in a glutinous vase; and halted at Apuleius, of whose works he owned the first edition printed at Rome in 1469."
"Sa faim se comblait; il chipota un bout de fromage bleu de Stilton dont la douceur s'imprégnait d'amertume, picora une tarte à la rhubarbe, et, pour varier, étancha sa soif avec le porter, cette bière noire qui sent le jus de réglisse dépouillé de sucre.","His hunger was being satisfied; he nabbed a piece of blue Stilton cheese whose sweetness was imbued with bitterness, pecked at a rhubarb tart, and, for variety, quenched his thirst with porter, that dark beer that smells of liquorice juice stripped of sugar. .","His hunger was now almost satisfied.

"Il en était de même de ses Rembrandt qu'il examinait, de temps à autre, à la dérobée; et, en effet, si le plus bel air du monde devient vulgaire, insupportable, dès que le public le fredonne, dès que les orgues s'en emparent, l'oeuvre d'art qui ne demeure pas indifférente aux faux artistes, qui n'est point contestée par les sots, qui ne se contente pas de susciter l'enthousiasme de quelques-uns, devient, elle aussi, par cela même, pour les initiés, polluée, banale, presque repoussante.","It was the same with his Rembrandts, which he examined from time to time on the sly; and, in fact, if the most beautiful air in the world becomes vulgar, unbearable, as soon as the public hums it, as soon as the organs seize it, the work of art which does not remain indifferent to false artists, who It is not contested by fools, which is not content to arouse the enthusiasm of a few, it also becomes, by this very fact, for the initiates, polluted, banal, almost repulsive.","He felt the same about his Rembrandts, which he examined now and then on the quiet; and it is of course true that, just as the loveliest melody in the world becomes unbearably vulgar once the public start humming it and the barrel-organs playing it, so the work of art that appeals to charlatans, endears itself to fools, and is not content to arouse the enthusiasm of a few connoisseurs, is thereby polluted in the eyes of the initiate and becomes commonplace, almost repulsive.","The same applied to his Rembrandts which he examined from time to time, half secretly; and if it be true that the loveliest tune imaginable becomes vulgar and insupportable as soon as the public begins to hum it and the hurdy-gurdies make it their own, the work of art which does not remain indifferent to the spurious artists, which is not contested by fools, and which is not satisfied with awakening the enthusiasm of the few, by this very fact becomes profaned, trite, almost repulsive to the initiate."

Here in my solitude I laugh at the fears of families which, to shun the approaching cold weather, escape on every steamer to Cannes and to other winter resorts."
"Une fois rapportée de chez le praticien qui la prit en pension, la bête fulgura comme un soleil, rayonna sur le tapis dont les teintes repoussées fléchirent, avec des irradiations de pavois wisigoth aux squames imbriquées par un artiste d'un goût barbare.","Once brought back from the practitioner who took it to boarding school, the beast flashed like a sun, shone on the carpet whose repulsed tints sagged, with irradiations of Visigoth shields with overlapping scales by an artist of barbaric taste.","Back from the workshop where the gilder had given it board and lodging, the reptile blazed as brightly as any sun, throwing out its rays over the carpet, whose tints turned pale and weak, and looking like a Visigothic shield tegulated with shining scales by a barbaric artist.","The tortoise, just returned by the lapidary, shone brilliantly, softening the tones of the rug and casting on it a gorgeous reflection which resembled the irradiations from the scales of a barbaric Visigoth shield."

"Il s'égarait dans les songes qu'évoquaient pour lui ces stances aromatiques, ramené soudain à son point de départ, au motif de sa méditation, par le retour du thème initial, reparaissant, à des intervalles ménagés, dans l'odorante orchestration du poème.","He lost himself in the dreams evoked for him by these aromatic stanzas, suddenly brought back to his point of departure, to the motif of his meditation, by the return of the initial theme, reappearing, at carefully arranged intervals, in the fragrant orchestration of the poem.","He used to roam haphazardly through the dreams conjured up for him by these aromatic stanzas, until he was suddenly brought back to his starting point, to the motif of his meditation, by the recurrence of the initial theme, reappearing at fixed intervals in the fragrant orchestration of the poem.","He strayed into reveries evoked by those aromatic stanzas, suddenly brought to his point of departure, to the motive of his meditation, by the return of the initial theme, reappearing, at stated intervals, in the fragrant orchestration of the poem."
"Ce jour-là, des Esseintes ôta cet incomparable livre de ses rayons et il le palpait dévotement, relisant certaines pièces qui lui semblaient, dans ce simple mais inestimable cadre, plus pénétrantes que de coutume.","That day, Des Esseintes removed this incomparable book from its shelves and he felt it devoutly, re-reading certain pieces which seemed to him, in this simple but invaluable setting, more penetrating than usual.","On this particular day, Des Esseintes took this incomparable volume down from his shelves and fondled it reverently, rereading certain pieces which in this simple but priceless setting seemed to him deeper and subtler than ever.","That day, Des Esseintes took this incomparable book from his shelves and handled it devotedly, once more reading certain pieces which seemed to him, in this simple but inestimable frame, more than ordinarily penetrating."
"Cette nouvelle roulait sur un simple adultère et concluait à un indicible effroi, alors que Bonhomet, déployant les prunelles de Claire, à son lit de mort, et les pénétrant avec de monstrueuses sondes, apercevait distinctement réfléchi le tableau du mari qui brandissait, au bout du bras, la tête coupée de l'amant, en hurlant, tel qu'un Canaque, un chant de guerre.","This news revolved around a simple adultery and concluded with an unspeakable dread, while Bonhomet, unfolding Claire's pupils, on her deathbed, and penetrating them with monstrous probes, perceived distinctly reflected the picture of the husband who brandished, at the end of the arm, the severed head of the lover, while shouting, like a Canaque, a song of war.","This story concerned a commonplace case of adultery, but ended on a note of indescribable terror when Bonhomet, uncovering the pupils of Claire’s eyes as she lay on her death-bed, and probing them with monstrous instruments, saw clearly reflected on the retina a picture of the husband brandishing at arm’s length the severed head of the lover and, like a Kanaka, howling a triumphant war-chant.","This story centered about a simple adultery and ended with an inexpressible terror when Bonhomet, opening Claire's eyelids, as she lies in her death bed, and penetrating them with monstrous plummets, distinctively perceives the reflection of the husband brandishing the lover's decapitated head, while shouting a war song, like a Kanaka."
"Il resta songeur, agité d'une crainte sourde; certes, si la théorie de Lacordaire était exacte, il n'avait rien à redouter, puisque le coup magique de la conversion ne se produit point dans un sursaut; il fallait, pour amener l'explosion, que le terrain fût longuement, constamment miné; mais si les romanciers parlent du coup de foudre de l'amour, un certain nombre de théologiens parlent aussi du coup de foudre de la religion; en admettant que cette doctrine fût vraie, personne n'était alors sûr de ne pas succomber. Il n'y avait plus ni analyse à faire sur soi-même, ni pressentiments à considérer, ni mesures préventives à requérir; la psychologie du mysticisme était nulle. C'était ainsi parce que c'était ainsi, et voilà tout.","He remained pensive, agitated by a dull fear; Certainly, if Lacordaire's theory were correct, he had nothing to fear, since the magic stroke of conversion does not occur suddenly; it was necessary, to bring about the explosion, that the ground be long, constantly mined; but if novelists speak of the thunderbolt of love, a certain number of theologians also speak of the thunderbolt of religion; admitting that this doctrine was true, no one was then sure of not succumbing. There was no longer any self-analysis to do, nor presentiments to consider, nor preventive measures to require; the psychology of mysticism was nil. It was like that because it was like that, and that's all.","He remained pensive, troubled by a nagging fear. Obviously, if Lacordaire’s theory was correct, he had nothing to worry about, seeing that the magic of conversion was not worked at a single stroke; to produce the explosion the ground had to be patiently and thoroughly mined. But if the novelists talked about love at first sight, there were also a number of theologians who spoke of conversion as of something equally sudden and overwhelming. Supposing that they were right, it followed that nobody could be sure he would never succumb. There was no longer any point in practising self-analysis, paying attention to presentiments or taking preventive measures: the psychology of mysticism was non-existent. Things happened because they happened, and that was the end of it.","He was left pensive, agitated by a vague fear. Certainly, if Lacordaire's theory were sound, he had nothing to be afraid of, since the magic touch of conversion is not to be consummated in a moment. To bring about the explosion, the ground must be constantly and assiduously mined. But just as the romancers speak of the thunderclap of love, so do theologians also speak of the thunderclap of conversion. No one was safe, should one admit the truth of this doctrine. There was no longer any need of self-analysis, of paying heed to presentiments, of taking preventive measures. The psychology of mysticism was void. Things were so because they were so, and that was all."
"Il se leva d'un bond, courut à la cuisine, ordonna de chercher dans le village, une miche, du fromage blanc, de la ciboule, prescrivit qu'on lui apprêtât une tartine absolument pareille à celle que rongeait l'enfant, et il retourna s'asseoir sous son arbre.","He jumped up, ran to the kitchen, ordered a loaf, cottage cheese, spring onions to be found in the village, ordered that they prepare a slice of bread for him exactly like the one the child was gnawing, and he returned to sit under his tree.","He sprang to his feet, ran to the kitchen and ordered his servants to send to the village for a round loaf, some white cheese, and a little garlic, explaining that he wanted a snack exactly like the one the child was having. This done, he went back to where he had been sitting under the tree.","He leaped up, ran to the kitchen and ordered a loaf, white cheese and green onions to be brought from the village, emphasizing his desire for a slice exactly like the one being eaten by the child. Then he returned to sit beneath the tree."
"Son ennui devint sans borne; la joie de posséder de mirobolantes floraisons était tarie; il était déjà blasé sur leur contexture et sur leurs nuances; puis malgré les soins dont il les entoura, la plupart de ses plantes dépérirent; il les fit enlever de ses pièces et, arrivé à un état d'excitabilité extrême, il s'irrita de ne plus les voir, l'oeil blessé par le vide des places qu'elles occupaient.","His boredom became boundless; the joy of possessing marvelous blooms was exhausted; he was already jaded on their texture and their shades; then in spite of the care with which he surrounded them, most of his plants withered away; he had them removed from his rooms and, having reached a state of extreme excitability, he was irritated at not seeing them any longer, his eyes hurt by the emptiness of the places they occupied.","His boredom grew to infinite proportions. The pleasure he had felt in the possession of astonishing flowers was exhausted; their shapes and colours had already lost the power to excite him. Besides, in spite of all the care he lavished on them, most of his plants died; he had them removed from his rooms, but his irritability had reached such a pitch that he was exasperated by their absence and his eye continually offended by the empty spaces they had left.","His ennui passed all bounds. His pleasure in the possession of his wonderful flowers was exhausted. Their textures and nuances palled on him. Besides, despite the care he lavished on them, most of his plants drooped. He had them removed from his rooms, but in his state of extreme excitability, their very absence exasperated him, for his eyes were pained by the void."
"Mais, où le tempérament de l'écrivain s'accusait vraiment, c'était dans deux brochures parues, l'une en 1846 et l'autre en 1880, cette dernière intitulée: l'Unité nationale.","But, where the temperament of the writer was really accused, it was in two published brochures, one in 1846 and the other in 1880, the latter entitled: National Unity.","But where the man’s temperament really showed itself was in two pamphlets which appeared in 1846 and 1880, the later work bearing the title L’Unité nationale.","But the true temperament of the writer was betrayed in the two brochures which appeared in 1848 and 1880, the latter entitled l'Unité nationale."
"Les domestiques effrayés s'empressèrent d'aller chercher le médecin de Fontenay qui ne comprit absolument rien à l'état de des Esseintes. Il bafouilla quelques termes médicaux, tâta le pouls, examina la langue du malade, tenta mais en vain de le faire parler, ordonna des calmants et du repos, promit de revenir le lendemain, et, sur un signe négatif de des Esseintes qui retrouva assez de force pour improuver le zèle de ses domestiques et congédier cet intrus, il partit et s'en fut raconter, par tout le village, les excentricités de cette maison dont l'ameublement l'avait positivement frappé de stupeur et gelé sur place.","The frightened servants hastened to fetch Fontenay's doctor, who understood absolutely nothing of Des Esseintes' condition. He stammered a few medical terms, felt the pulse, examined the patient's tongue, tried but in vain to make him speak, ordered tranquilizers and rest, promised to return the next day, and, on a negative sign from des Esseintes, who recovered enough forced to prove the zeal of his servants and dismiss this intruder, he left and went to tell, through the whole village, the eccentricities of this house whose furnishings had positively struck him with stupor and froze on the spot.","The frightened servants immediately sent for the Fontenay doctor, who was completely baffled by Des Esseintes’s condition. He muttered a few medical terms, felt the patient’s pulse, examined his tongue, tried in vain to get him to talk, ordered sedatives and rest and promised to come back the next day. But at this Des Esseintes summoned up enough strength to reprove his servants for their excessive zeal and to dismiss the intruder, who went off to tell the whole village about the house, the eccentric furnishings of which had left him dumbfounded and flabbergasted.","The servants were seized with alarm and lost no time in calling the Fontenay physician who was completely at sea about Des Esseintes' condition. He mumbled a few medical terms, felt his pulse, examined the invalid's tongue, unsuccessfully sought to make him speak, prescribed sedatives and rest, promised to return on the morrow and, at the negative sign made by Des Esseintes who recovered enough strength to chide the zeal of his servants and to bid farewell to this intruder, he departed and was soon retailing through the village the eccentricities of this house whose decorations had positively amazed him and held him rooted to the spot."
"Pour les artisans usés par les durs labeurs des ateliers, pour les petits employés trop souvent pères, l'illusion d'un peu de bon air est, grâce à ces commerçants, possible.","For the craftsmen worn out by the hard work of the workshops, for the small employees too often fathers, the illusion of a little fresh air is, thanks to these tradesmen, possible.","‘For the artisan worn out by the hard labour of the workshops, for the little clerk blessed with too many offspring, the illusion of enjoying a little fresh air is a practical possibility – thanks to these manufacturers.","“For the workmen exhausted by the hard labors of the plants, for the young employes who too often are fathers, the illusion of a little healthy air is possible, thanks to these manufacturers."
"Il fit venir à Fontenay ce ménage habitué à un emploi de garde-malade, à une régularité d'infirmiers distribuant, d'heure en heure, des cuillerées de potion et de tisane, à un rigide silence de moines claustrés, sans communication avec le dehors, dans des pièces aux fenêtres et aux portes closes.","He brought to Fontenay this couple accustomed to the job of nurse, to the regularity of nurses distributing, from hour to hour, spoonfuls of potion and herbal tea, to the rigid silence of cloistered monks, without communication with the outside, in rooms with closed windows and doors.","He took with him to Fontenay this faithful pair who had been accustomed to a methodical sickroom routine, trained to administer spoonfuls of physic and medicinal brews at regular intervals and inured to the absolute silence of cloistered monks, barred from all communication with the outside world and confined to rooms where the doors and windows were always shut.","They were accustomed to the regular life of hospital attendants hourly serving the patients their stipulated food and drink, to the rigid silence of cloistral monks who live behind barred doors and windows, having no communication with the outside world."
"Peu à peu, les arcanes de cet art, le plus négligé de tous, s'étaient ouverts devant des Esseintes qui déchiffrait maintenant cette langue, variée, aussi insinuante que celle de la littérature, ce style d'une concision inouïe, sous son apparence flottante et vague.","Little by little, the mysteries of this art, the most neglected of all, had opened up before Des Esseintes who was now deciphering this language, varied, as insinuating as that of literature, this style of unheard-of conciseness, under its appearance floating and vague.","Little by little the arcana of this art, the most neglected of them all, had been revealed to Des Esseintes, who could now decipher its complex language that was as subtle as any human tongue, yet wonderfully concise under its apparent vagueness and ambiguity.","Little by little, the arcana of this art, most neglected of all, was revealed to Des Esseintes who could now read this language, as diversified and insinuating as that of literature, this style with its unexpected concision under its vague flowing appearance."
"- Brou! fit-il, attristé par l'assaut de ces souvenirs. Il se leva pour rompre l'horrible charme de cette vision et, revenu dans la vie présente, il s'inquiéta de la tortue.","- Bro! he said, saddened by the onslaught of these memories. He got up to break the horrible spell of this vision and, back in the present life, he worried about the turtle.","‘Ugh!’ he said to himself, shuddering over these gruesome recollections. He got to his feet to break the horrid fascination of his nightmare vision, and coming back to present-day preoccupations he felt suddenly uneasy about the tortoise.","“Phew!” he exclaimed, saddened by the assault of these memories. He rose to dissipate the horrible spell of this vision and, returning to reality, began to be concerned with the tortoise."
"Aussi les ouvrait-il à peine, maintenant que le domestique les lui tendait. Il se bornait à indiquer la place qu'elles devaient occuper, veillant à ce qu'elles fussent classées, en bon ordre, et à l'aise.","So he hardly opened them now that the servant held them out to him. He confined himself to indicating the place they should occupy, ensuring that they were classified, in good order, and at ease.","Accordingly, he scarcely looked at them when his man handed them to him. He confined himself to pointing out where they should go, taking care to see that they were arranged in an orderly fashion and given plenty of elbow-room.","Even now when the servant was arranging them for him, he did not care to open them, and contented himself merely with indicating the place they were to occupy and seeing that they were properly classified and put away."
"Certaines parties pour violoncelle de Schumann l'avaient positivement laissé haletant et étranglé par l'étouffante boule de l'hystérie; mais c'étaient surtout des lieders de Schubert qui l'avaient soulevé, jeté hors de lui, puis prostré de même qu'après une déperdition de fluide nerveux, après une ribote mystique d'âme.","Some of Schumann's cello parts had positively left him panting and choking with the choking ball of hysteria; but it was above all Schubert's Lieders that had lifted him up, thrown him out of his mind, then prostrated just as after a loss of nervous fluid, after a mystical binge of soul.","Certain settings for the violoncello by Schumann had left him positively panting with emotion, choking with hysteria; but it was chiefly Schubert’s Lieder that had excited him, carried him away, then prostrated him as if he had been squandering his nervous energy, indulging in a mystical debauch.","Some of Schubert's parts for violoncello had positively left him panting, in the grip of hysteria. But it was particularly Schubert's lieders that had immeasurably excited him, causing him to experience similar sensations as after a waste of nervous fluid, or a mystic dissipation of the soul."
"Il tenta de faire cesser cette confusion, mais après dix minutes de travail, des sueurs l'inondèrent; cet effort l'épuisait; il fut s'étendre, brisé, sur un divan, et il sonna son domestique.","He tried to stop this confusion, but after ten minutes of work, sweats flooded him; this effort exhausted him; he was stretched out, broken, on a divan, and he rang for his servant.","He tried to remedy this confusion, but after ten minutes’ work he was bathed in sweat. The effort was obviously too much for him; utterly exhausted, he lay down on a couch and rang for his servant.","He tried to clear up the confusion, but after ten minutes of work, perspiration covered him; the effort weakened him. He stretched himself on a couch and rang for his servant."
Toutes ces pièces prenaient jour du côté opposé à la vallée d'Aunay et regardaient la tour du Croy et Châtillon.,All these parts were day on the opposite side to the valley of Aunay and looked at the tower of Croy and Châtillon.,"All these latter rooms looked out on the opposite side to the valley of Aunay, towards the Tour du Croy and Châtillon.",These rooms received the light from the side opposite the Aunay Valley and faced the Towers of Croy and Chatillon.
"Seulement, cette déliquescence continuée après la mort de Tertullien, par son élève saint Cyprien, par Arnobe, par le pâteux Lactance, était sans attrait. C'était un faisandage incomplet et alenti; c'étaient de gauches retours aux emphases cicéroniennes, n'ayant pas encore ce fumet spécial qu'au Ve siècle, et surtout pendant les siècles qui vont suivre, l'odeur du christianisme donnera à la langue païenne, décomposée comme une venaison, s'émiettant en même temps que s'effritera la civilisation du vieux monde, en même temps que s'écrouleront, sous la poussée des Barbares, les Empires putréfiés par la sanie des siècles.","Only, this decay continued after the death of Tertullian, by his pupil Saint Cyprian, by Arnobe, by the pasty Lactantius, was unattractive. It was incomplete and slowed down pheasantry; they were awkward returns to Ciceronian bombasts, not yet having that special flavor that in the fifth century, and especially during the centuries that were to follow, the smell of Christianity would give the pagan language, decomposed like venison, its crumbling at the same time as the civilization of the old world will crumble, at the same time as will collapse, under the pressure of the Barbarians, the Empires putrefied by the sanies of the centuries.","However, this deliquescence, which was carried on after Tertullian’s death by his pupil St Cyprian, by Arnobius, by the obscure Lactantius, was an unattractive process. It was a slow and partial decay, retarded by awkward attempts to return to the emphasis of Cicero’s periods; as yet it had not acquired that special gamey flavour which in the fourth century – and even more in the following centuries – the odour of Christianity was to give to the pagan tongue as it decomposed like venison, dropping to pieces at the same time as the civilization of the Ancient World, falling apart while the Empires succumbed to the barbarian onslaught and the accumulated pus of ages.","But there was no attraction in this dissolution, continued after Tertullian's death by his pupil, Saint Cyprian, by Arnobius and by Lactantius. There was something lacking; it made clumsy returns to Ciceronian magniloquence, but had not yet acquired that special flavor which in the fourth century, and particularly during the centuries following, the odor of Christianity would give the pagan tongue, decomposed like old venison, crumbling at the same time that the old world civilization collapsed, and the Empires, putrefied by the sanies of the centuries, succumbed to the thrusts of the barbarians."
