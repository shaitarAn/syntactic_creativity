"— Or, si l’eau n’est pas absolument incompressible, elle est, du moins, très peu compressible. En effet, d’après les calculs les plus récents, cette réduction n’est que de quatre cent trente-six dix millionièmes par atmosphère, ou par chaque trente pieds de profondeur. S’agit-il d’aller à mille mètres, je tiens compte alors de la réduction du volume sous une pression équivalente à celle d’une colonne d’eau de mille mètres, c’est-à-dire sous une pression de cent atmosphères. Cette réduction sera alors de quatre cent trente-six cent millièmes. Je devrai donc accroître le poids de façon à peser quinze cent treize tonneaux soixante-dix-sept centièmes, au lieu de quinze cent sept tonneaux deux dixièmes. L’augmentation ne sera conséquemment que de six tonneaux cinquante-sept centièmes.","— Now, if water is not absolutely incompressible, it is at least very slightly compressible. Indeed, according to the most recent calculations, this reduction is only four hundred and thirty-six ten millionths per atmosphere, or per every thirty feet of depth. Is it a question of going to a thousand meters, then I take into account the reduction in volume under a pressure equivalent to that of a column of water of a thousand meters, that is to say under a pressure of one hundred atmospheres. This reduction will then be four hundred and thirty-six hundred thousandths. I will therefore have to increase the weight so as to weigh fifteen hundred and thirteen tons seventy-seven hundredths, instead of fifteen hundred and seven tons two tenths. The increase will therefore only be six barrels fifty-seven hundredths.","‘Now although water is not completely incompressible, it is very hard to compress. Indeed, according to the most recent calculations, the reduction is only 436/10,000,000ths per atmosphere of pressure, or for each 30 feet down. So if I wish to reach a depth of 1,000 metres, I need to take into account the reduction of volume due to a pressure equivalent to a column of water 1,000 metres high, that is at a pressure of 100 atmospheres. * This reduction will then be 436/100,000ths. I must therefore increase the weight so as to displace 1,513.77 tons instead of 1,507.2. The increase will consequently be only 6.57 tons.’","“Now, if water is not absolutely incompressible, it is at least capable of very slight compression. Indeed, after the most recent calculations this reduction is only 0.000436 of an atmosphere for each thirty feet of depth. If we want to sink 3,000 feet, I should keep account of the reduction of bulk under a pressure equal to that of a column of water of a thousand feet.","“Now then, if water isn't absolutely incompressible, at least it compresses very little. In fact, according to the latest calculations, this reduction is only.0000436 per atmosphere, or per every 32 feet of depth. To go 3,200 feet down, I have to take into account the reduction in volume that occurs under a pressure equivalent to a 3,200-foot column of water, in other words, under a pressure of a hundred atmospheres. In this instance the reduction would be.00436. Consequently I would need to increase my weight from 1,661.4 tons to 1668.64. So the additional weight would only be 7.24 tons.”"

These are special currents that can be identified by their temperature and color, and the most remarkable one is known as the Gulf Stream. Science has determined the global paths of five chief currents: one in the north Atlantic, a second in the south Atlantic, a third in the north Pacific, a fourth in the south Pacific, and a fifth in the southern Indian Ocean. It's even likely that a sixth current used to exist in the northern Indian Ocean, when the Caspian and Aral seas joined up with certain large Asian lakes to make one uniform expanse of water."
"L’orifice évidé dans la tôle du Nautilus fut préalablement fermé et boulonné au moyen d’une clef anglaise dont Ned Land s’était muni. L’ouverture du canot se ferma également, et le Canadien commença à dévisser les écrous qui nous retenaient encore au bateau sous-marin.","The hollow hole in the sheet metal of the Nautilus was previously closed and bolted using an adjustable spanner which Ned Land had provided. The opening of the canoe also closed, and the Canadian began to unscrew the nuts which still held us to the underwater boat.","The opening in the metal skin of the Nautilus was closed and bolted using an adjustable spanner Ned had brought with him.

"« En effet, le narwal est armé d’une sorte d’épée d’ivoire, d’une hallebarde, suivant l’expression de certains naturalistes. C’est une dent principale qui a la dureté de l’acier. On a trouvé quelques-unes de ces dents implantées dans le corps des baleines que le narwal attaque toujours avec succès. D’autres ont été arrachées, non sans peine, de carènes de vaisseaux qu’elles avaient percées d’outre en outre, comme un foret perce un tonneau.

There's my greatest source of irritation—a wall!”"
"— A peu près, monsieur le professeur. Pour un pied que les icebergs ont au-dessus de la mer, ils en ont trois au-dessous. Or, puisque ces montagnes de glaces ne dépassent pas une hauteur de cent mètres, elles ne s’enfoncent que de trois cents. Or, qu’est-ce que trois cents mètres pour le Nautilus ?","“Pretty much, Professor. For one foot that icebergs have above the sea, they have three below. Now, since these mountains of ice do not exceed a height of one hundred meters, they only sink three hundred. Now, what is three hundred meters for the Nautilus?","* ‘Approximately, monsieur. For each foot that icebergs stand up above sea level, they have three below. Now since these mountains of ice do not exceed a height of 100 metres, they go no more than 300 into the water.

"Vers quatre heures du soir, le terrain, généralement composé d’une vase épaisse et entremêlée de branches minéralisées, se modifia peu à peu, il devint plus rocailleux et parut semé de conglomérats, de tufs basaltiques, avec quelques semis de laves et d’obsidiennes sulfureuses. Je pensai que la région des montagnes allait bientôt succéder aux longues plaines, et, en effet, dans certaines évolutions du Nautilus, j’aperçus l’horizon méridional barré par une haute muraille qui semblait fermer toute issue. Son sommet dépassait évidemment le niveau de l’Océan. Ce devait être un continent, ou tout au moins une île, soit une des Canaries, soit une des îles du cap Vert. Le point n’ayant pas été fait — à dessein peut-être — j’ignorais notre position. En tout cas, une telle muraille me parut marquer la fin de cette Atlantide, dont nous n’avions parcouru, en somme, qu’une minime portion.","Around four o'clock in the evening, the ground, generally composed of a thick mud interspersed with mineralized branches, changed little by little, it became more rocky and seemed to be strewn with conglomerates, basaltic tuffs, with a few seedlings of lava and sulphurous obsidians. I thought that the region of the mountains would soon succeed the long plains, and, indeed, in certain evolutions of the Nautilus, I saw the southern horizon barred by a high wall which seemed to close all exit. Its summit obviously exceeded the level of the ocean. It must have been a continent, or at least an island, either one of the Canaries or one of the Cape Verde islands. The point having not been made - on purpose perhaps - I did not know our position. In any case, such a wall seemed to me to mark the end of this Atlantis, of which we had traveled, in short, only a tiny portion.","At about four in the afternoon the terrain, generally composed of thick mud mixed with mineralized branches, began to change: it became rockier and seemed strewn with conglomerates and basaltic tuffs, with a few sprinklings of lava and sulphurous obsidian. I thought that a mountain region would soon interrupt the broad plains and, indeed, during some of the Nautilus’s manoeuvres, I caught a glimpse of the southern horizon blocked by a high wall apparently closing the way out. Its top part was clearly above water level. This had to be a large landmass or at the very least an island, perhaps one of the islands of the Canaries or Cape Verde. Since the position had not been taken — on purpose perhaps —  I did not know where we were. * But in any case such a wall seemed to mark the end of Atlantis, of which we had actually only covered a tiny part.","About four o’clock the soil, generally composed of a thick mud mixed with petrified wood, changed by degrees, and it became more stony and seemed strewn with conglomerate and pieces of basalt, with a sprinkling of lava and sulphurous obsidian. I thought that a mountainous region was succeeding the long plains, and accordingly, after a few evolutions of the Nautilus, I saw the southerly horizon blocked by a high wall which seemed to close all exit. Its summit evidently passed the level of the ocean. It must be a continent, or at least an island—one of the Canaries, or of the Cape Verde Islands. The bearings not being yet taken, perhaps designedly, I was ignorant of our exact position. In any case, such a wall seemed to me to mark the limits of that Atlantis of which we had in reality passed over only the smallest part.","The terrain consisted mostly of heavy slime interspersed with petrified branches, but it gradually changed around four o'clock in the afternoon; it grew rockier and seemed to be sprinkled with pudding stones and a basaltic gravel known as tuff, along with a few pinches of lava and sulfurous obsidian. I figured these long plains would soon lead to a mountain region, and sure enough, as the Nautilus turned this way and that, I saw a high wall blocking the southerly horizon and apparently closing off all exits. Its top obviously poked above the level of the ocean. It must have been a continent or at the very least an island, either one of the Canaries or one of the Cape Verde Islands. Our bearings hadn't been marked on the chart—maybe deliberately—and I had no idea what our position was. In any event that wall seemed to signal the end of Atlantis, of which, all in all, we'd crossed only the tiniest part."
"— En effet, dis-je. Aussi un bon avis à ces actionnaires serait-il acte de charité. Qui sait pourtant s’il serait bien reçu.

"Puis, la conversation fut suspendue, et chacun de nous se mit à réfléchir à part soi. J’avouerai que, pour mon compte, et malgré l’assurance du harponneur, je ne conservais aucune illusion.

Pour être si sûrement manœuvré, le bateau sous-marin exigeait un nombreux équipage, et conséquemment, dans le cas d’une lutte, nous aurions affaire à trop forte partie. D’ailleurs, il fallait, avant tout, être libres, et nous ne l’étions pas. Je ne voyais même aucun moyen de fuir cette cellule de tôle si hermétiquement fermée. Et pour peu que l’étrange commandant de ce bateau eût un secret à garder — ce qui paraissait au moins probable il ne nous laisserait pas agir librement à son bord. Maintenant, se débarrasserait-il de nous par la violence, ou nous jetterait-il un jour sur quelque coin de terre ? C’était là l’inconnu.

I will confess that, on my own account, and despite the assurance of the harpooner, I harbored no illusions. I did not accept these favorable chances of which Ned Land had spoken. To be maneuvered so surely, the submarine required a large crew, and consequently, in the event of a struggle, we would have to deal with too many. Besides, it was necessary, above all, to be free, and we were not. I couldn't even see any way to escape this hermetically sealed tin cell. And if the strange captain of this boat had a secret to keep - which seemed at least probable - he would not let us act freely on board. Now, would he get rid of us by violence, or would he throw us one day on some corner of the earth? That was the unknown. All these hypotheses seemed extremely plausible to me, and you had to be a harpooner to hope to regain your freedom.","Our conversation ended here, and we each began to think our own thoughts. For my part, I must confess that I had few illusions, despite the harpooner’s pledge. I didn’t believe in a favourable opportunity like Ned. To run such a tight submarine ship needed a large crew, and if push came to shove we would be overwhelmed. Besides we would need to be at liberty, which was not the case. I couldn’t even see a way of escaping from this hermetically sealed cell of metal plates. And if the vessel’s strange commander had any sort of secret to maintain — which was highly probable —  he would not allow us to act freely on board. Might he not eliminate us by violent means, or one day cast us off on some remote piece of land? There was no way of telling. But all these conjectures appeared extremely plausible, and I thought that you had to be a harpooner to hope to escape again.","Time was getting on, and we were fearfully hungry; and this time the steward did not appear.","Then our conversation broke off and each of us sank into his own private thoughts. For my part, despite the harpooner's confident talk, I admit that I didn't entertain any illusions. I hadn't any faith in those promising opportunities Ned Land kept going on about. To operate as efficiently as it did, this underwater boat had to have a sizeable crew, so if it came to a physical contest, we would be facing an overwhelming opponent. Besides, before we could take action we had to be free, and that certainly wasn't the case. I couldn't see any way out of this sheet-iron, hermetically sealed cell. And if the strange commander of this boat did have a secret to keep—which seemed pretty likely—he would never give us freedom of movement aboard his vessel. Now, would he resort to violence in order to get rid of us, or would he drop us off one day on some patch of solid ground? There lay the unknown. All these theories seemed extremely plausible to me, and to hope for freedom through use of force, you had to be a harpooner."

"Mais l’hypothèse d’une machine de guerre tomba encore devant la déclaration des gouvernements.

"— En effet, dis-je, entraîné par le raisonnement du capitaine, si la surface de la mer est solidifiée par les glaces, ses couches inférieures sont libres, par cette raison providentielle qui a placé à un degré supérieur à celui de la congélation le maximum de densité de l’eau de mer.

And if I am not mistaken, isn’t the ratio of the underwater part of the icefield to the part above the water four to one?’","“Certainly,” said I, carried away by the captain’s reasoning; “if the surface of the sea is solidified by the ice, the lower depths are free by the providential law which has placed the maximum of density of the waters of the ocean one degree higher than freezing-point; and, if I am not mistaken, the portion of this iceberg which is above the water is as one to four to that which is below.”","“You're right,” I said, carried along by the captain's logic. “Even though the surface of the sea has solidified into ice, its lower strata will still be open, for the fortuitous reason that salt water reaches its maximum density at one degree above its freezing point. And if I'm not mistaken, the submerged part of this ice barrier is in a four-to-one ratio to the part above water.”"

"La portion du globe terrestre occupée par les eaux est évaluée à trois millions huit cent trente-deux milles cinq cent cinquante-huit myriamètres carrés, soit plus de trente-huit millions d’hectares. Cette masse liquide comprend deux milliards deux cent cinquante millions de milles cubes, et formerait une sphère d’un diamètre de soixante lieues dont le poids serait de trois quintillions de tonneaux. Et, pour comprendre ce nombre, il faut se dire que le quintillion est au milliard ce que le milliard est à l’unité, c’est-à-dire qu’il y a autant de milliards dans un quintillion que d’unités dans un milliard. Or, cette masse liquide, c’est à peu près la quantité d’eau que verseraient tous les fleuves de la terre pendant quarante mille ans.","The portion of the earth occupied by water is estimated at three million eight hundred and thirty-two thousand five hundred and fifty-eight square myriameters, or more than thirty-eight million hectares. This liquid mass comprises two billion two hundred and fifty million cubic miles, and would form a sphere with a diameter of sixty leagues whose weight would be three quintillion tons. And, to understand this number, it is necessary to say that the quintillion is to the billion what the billion is to the unit, that is to say that there are as many billions in a quintillion as there are units in one billion. Now, this liquid mass is approximately the quantity of water that all the rivers of the earth would pour for forty thousand years.","The area of the terrestrial globe covered by water is estimated to be 383,255,800 square kilometres, or more than 38 million hectares. * This liquid mass occupies 2,250 million cubic miles and would form a sphere of 60 leagues diameter, whose weight would be three quadrillion tons.

This fluid mass comprises two billions two hundred and fifty millions of cubic miles, forming a spherical body of a diameter of sixty leagues, the weight of which would be three quintillions of tons. To comprehend the meaning of these figures, it is necessary to observe that a quintillion is to a billion as a billion is to unity; in other words, there are as many billions in a quintillion as there are units in a billion. This mass of fluid is equal to about the quantity of water which would be discharged by all the rivers of the earth in forty thousand years.","THE PART OF THE planet earth that the seas cover is estimated to be 147,975,892 square miles, hence more than 94 billion acres. This mass of liquid totals 2,250,000,000 cubic miles and could form a globe with a diameter of 150 miles, whose weight would be over three quintillion tons. To grasp such a number, we need to remember that a quintillion is to a billion as a billion is to one, in other words, there are as many billions in a quintillion as ones in a billion!

"Par tribord, sur le fond, apparaissait une forte extumescence qui attira mon attention. On eût dit des ruines ensevelies sous un empâtement de coquilles blanchâtres comme sous un manteau de neige. En examinant attentivement cette masse, je crus reconnaître les formes épaissies d’un navire, rasé de ses mâts, qui devait avoir coulé par l’avant.

Its hull must have spent many years on the ocean floor to be so encrusted with limestone from the water.","But to starboard, on the bottom appeared a large protuberance, which at once attracted my attention. One would have thought it a ruin buried under a coating of white shells, much resembling a covering of snow.

This wreck, to be thus incrusted with the lime of the water, must already be able to count many years passed at the bottom of the ocean.","To starboard a prominent bulge on the sea bottom caught my attention. It seemed to be some old ruin buried beneath a crust of whitened seashells, as if under a blanket of snow.

Or, using a method that was much more natural, economical, and therefore probable, did he simply come up to the surface to breathe like a whale, and thus renew his supply of air for another twenty-four hours? Whatever the case, however he did it, it seemed sensible to act as soon as possible.","That gave rise to a question in my mind. How would the commander of this floating dwelling-place proceed? Would he obtain air by chemical means, in getting by heat the oxygen contained in chlorate of potash, and in absorbing carbonic acid by caustic potash?ad Or, a more convenient, economical, and consequently more probable alternative, would he be satisfied to rise and take breath at the surface of the water, like a cetacean, and so renew for twenty-four hours the atmospheric provision?","Here a question popped into my head. How did the commander of this seagoing residence go about it? Did he obtain air using chemical methods, releasing the oxygen contained in potassium chlorate by heating it, meanwhile absorbing the carbon dioxide with potassium hydroxide? If so, he would have to keep up some sort of relationship with the shore, to come by the materials required for this operation. Did he limit himself to storing his air in high-pressure tanks, dispensing it as his crew needed it? Maybe. Or, proceeding in a more convenient, more economical, and therefore more likely manner, was he content with simply returning to breathe at the surface of the water like a cetacean, replenishing his oxygen supply every twenty-four hours? In any event, whatever his method was, it seemed sensible to me that he use this method without delay."

Once or twice Conseil commented on this material. I told him it was made from the glossy silky threads which attach fan mussels to rocks, these being a variety of shell plentiful on the Mediterranean shores.

"— Oui, de francs ! Trois millions de francs, repris-je. Mais je crois que ces pêcheries ne rapportent plus ce qu’elles rapportaient autrefois.

But I believe that these fisheries no longer bring in what they once did. It is the same with the American fisheries, which, under the reign of Charles V, produced four million francs, now reduced to two-thirds. In sum, the general yield of pearl mining can be estimated at nine million francs.","‘Yes, francs. Three million francs, but apparently these pearl fisheries no longer bring in what they used to. The same holds true of the American ones, which produced four million francs in the reign of Charles V of France* but at present, only two-thirds of that. In sum, the total turnover from pearls can be evaluated at nine million francs.’","“But,” said Conseil, “is this pearl-fishing dangerous?”","“Right, dollars!” I continued. “$600,000! But I doubt that these fisheries bring in the returns they once did. Likewise the American fisheries used to make an annual profit of $800,000 during the reign of King Charles V, but now they bring in only two-thirds of that amount.

"La classe des spongiaires, première du groupe des polypes, a été précisément créée par ce curieux produit dont l’utilité est incontestable. L’éponge n’est point un végétal comme l’admettent encore quelques naturalistes, mais un animal du dernier ordre, un polypier inférieur à celui du corail. Son animalité n’est pas douteuse, et on ne peut même adopter l’opinion des anciens qui la regardaient comme un être intermédiaire entre la plante et l’animal. Je dois dire cependant, que les naturalistes ne sont pas d’accord sur le mode d’organisation de l’éponge. Pour les uns, c’est un polypier, et pour d’autres tels que M. Milne Edwards, c’est un individu isolé et unique.","The class of sponges, first of the group of polyps, was created precisely by this curious product whose usefulness is indisputable. The sponge is not a plant, as some naturalists still admit, but an animal of the last order, a polypary inferior to that of the coral. Its animality is not in doubt, and we cannot even adopt the opinion of the ancients who regarded it as an intermediate being between plant and animal. I must say, however, that naturalists do not agree on the mode of organization of the sponge. For some, it is a polypary, and for others such as Mr. Milne Edwards, it is an isolated and unique individual.","The class of Porifera, the first of the group of polyps, was created for precisely this strange product, of such obvious usefulness.

I must say, however, that naturalists are not in agreement on how the sponge is organized. For some it is a polypary, and for others, such as M. Milne-Edwards, it is an isolated and unique individual.","Other zoöphytes which multiply near the sponges consist principally of medusæ of a most elegant kind. The mollusks were represented by varieties of the calmar (which, according to Orbigny, are peculiar to the Red Sea); and reptiles by the virgata turtle, of the genus of cheloniæ, which furnished a wholesome and delicate food for our table.","First division in the polyp group, the class Spongiaria has been established by scientists just for this interesting item whose usefulness is beyond dispute. The sponge definitely isn't a plant, as some naturalists still believe, but an animal of the lowest order, a polypary inferior even to coral. Its animal nature isn't in doubt, and we can't accept even the views of the ancients, who regarded it as halfway between plant and animal. But I must admit that naturalists aren't in agreement on the structural makeup of sponges.

"La véritable source du Gulf-Stream, reconnue par le commandant Maury, son point de départ, si l’on veut. est situé dans le golfe de Gascogne. Là, ses eaux, encore faibles de température et de couleur. commencent à se former. Il descend au sud, longe l’Afrique équatoriale, échauffe ses flots aux rayons de la zone torride, traverse l’Atlantique. atteint le cap San-Roque sur la côte brésilienne, et se bifurque en deux branches dont l’une va se saturer encore des chaudes molécules de la mer des Antilles. Alors, le Gulf-Stream, chargé de rétablir l’équilibre entre les températures et de mêler les eaux des tropiques aux eaux boréales, commence son rôle de pondérateur. Chauffé à blanc dans le golfe du Mexique, il s’élève au nord sur les côtes américaines, s’avance jusqu’à Terre-Neuve, dévie sous la poussée du courant froid du détroit de Davis, reprend la route de l’Océan en suivant sur un des grands cercles du globe la ligne loxodromique, se divise en deux bras vers le quarante-troisième degré, dont l’un, aidé par l’alizé du nord-est, revient au Golfe de Gascogne et aux Açores, et dont l’autre, après avoir attiédi les rivages de l’Irlande et de la Norvège, va jusqu’au-delà du Spitzberg, où sa température tombe à quatre degrés, former la mer libre du pôle.","The true source of the Gulf Stream, recognized by Commander Maury, its starting point, if you will. is located in the Bay of Biscay. There, its waters, still low in temperature and color. begin to form. It descends to the south, skirts equatorial Africa, warms its waves with the rays of the torrid zone, crosses the Atlantic. reaches Cape San-Roque on the Brazilian coast, and branches off into two branches, one of which will still be saturated with the warm molecules of the Caribbean Sea. Then, the Gulf-Stream, responsible for restoring the balance between temperatures and mixing the waters of the tropics with boreal waters, begins its role of weighting. White-hot in the Gulf of Mexico, it rises to the north on the American coasts, advances as far as Newfoundland, deflects under the pressure of the cold current of the Davis Strait, resumes the ocean route in following the loxodromic line on one of the great circles of the globe, divides into two arms towards the forty-third degree, one of which, aided by the northeast trade wind, returns to the Bay of Biscay and the Azores, and of which the other, after having warmed the shores of Ireland and Norway, reaches beyond Spitsbergen, where its temperature falls to four degrees, to form the open sea of the pole.","The true source of the Gulf Stream, discovered by Commander Maury, its starting-point so to speak, is the Bay of Biscay. There its pale water, still cool, begins to collect. It heads southwards, heads along equatorial Africa, warms its water in the rays of the tropics, crosses the Atlantic, reaches Cape São Roque on the Brazilian coast, and then splits into two branches, with one heading off to renew itself in the warm molecules of the Antilles. Then the Gulf Stream begins its role as moderator, for it is charged with re-establishing the equilibrium between temperatures and with mixing the waters of the tropics with the northern waters. Greatly heated in the Gulf of Mexico, it heads north along the American coast, reaches as far as Nova Scotia, changes direction under the impact of the cold current from the Davis Strait, and heads back out to sea. Following a line of latitude, a loxodromic track, it splits in two at about the 43rd degree, with one branch, helped on by the north-east trade wind, returning to the Bay of Biscay and the Azores, and the other, having slightly warmed the shores of Ireland and Norway, heading past Spitsbergen, where it falls to 4° and forms the open sea of the Pole. *",The body of its waters is more considerable than that of all the rivers on the globe.,"As Commander Maury discovered, the true source of the Gulf Stream—its starting point, if you prefer—is located in the Bay of Biscay. There, still cool and colorless, its waters begin to form. It heads south, skirts equatorial Africa, warms its waves in the sunshine of the Torrid Zone, crosses the Atlantic, reaches Cape São Roque on the coast of Brazil, and splits into two branches, one heading for the Caribbean Sea whereit's further infused with marine heat particles. Then the Gulf Stream starts to play its stabilizing role, balancing hot and cold temperatures and blending tropical and northern waters. Reaching a white heat in the Gulf of Mexico, it heads north up the American coast, proceeds as far as Newfoundland, veers away under pressure from a cold current out of Davis Strait, and resumes its course in midocean by going along a great circle of the earth on a rhumb line;20 then it divides into two arms near latitude 43°; one, helped by the northeast trade winds, heads back to the Bay of Biscay and the Azores; the other pours lukewarm water over the shores of Ireland and Norway, then heads beyond Spitsbergen where it falls to 39° Fahrenheit and forms the open sea at the pole."

"Et en effet, la réaction ne tarda pas à se produire. Pendant trois mois, trois mois dont chaque jour durait un siècle ! l’Abraham-Lincoln sillonna toutes les mers septentrionales du Pacifique, courant aux baleines signalées, faisant de brusques écarts de route, virant subitement d’un bord sur l’autre, s’arrêtant soudain, forçant ou renversant sa vapeur, coup sur coup, au risque de déniveler sa machine, et il ne laissa pas un point inexploré des rivages du Japon à la côte américaine. Et rien ! rien que l’immensité des flots déserts !

For three months — three months when each day lasted a century —  the Abraham Lincoln had been sailing across every sea in the South Pacific, running up when a whale was signalled, making abrupt turns, sailing first on one tack then on the other, stopping suddenly, reversing then going ahead — all in swift succession and in a manner designed to put the engine entirely out of joint. The ship did not leave a single point unexplored between the shore of Japan and the west coast of America. But there was nothing there, nothing except the vastness of the watery wilderness. No sign of a giant narwhal, nor of a submerged islet, shipwrecked hulk, or shifting reef, and no sign whatsoever of anything remotely supernatural.","And truly, reaction soon showed itself. For three months, during which a day seemed an age, the Abraham Lincoln furrowed all the waters of the Northern Pacific, running at whales, making sharp deviations from her course, veering suddenly from one tack to another, stopping suddenly, putting on steam, and backing ever and anon at the risk of deranging her machinery; and not one point of the Japanese or American coast was left unexplored.","And in fact this reaction wasn't long in coming. For three months during which every day seemed like a century, the Abraham Lincoln plowed all the northerly seas of the Pacific, racing after whales we'd sighted, suddenly veering off course, swerving sharply from one tack to another, stopping abruptly, putting on steam and reversing engines in quick succession—at the risk of stripping its gears—and not leaving a single sector unexplored from the beaches of Japan to the coasts of America.

"— D’ailleurs, dis-je, pour tirer sous l’eau, dans un milieu huit cent cinquante-cinq fois plus dense que l’air il faudrait vaincre une résistance considérable.","“Besides,” I said, “to shoot under water, in an environment eight hundred and fifty-five times denser than air, you would have to overcome considerable resistance.","‘But in any case,’ I persisted, ‘in order to be able to fire it underwater, in a medium 855 times as dense as air, you need to overcome considerable resistance.’","“Besides,” I added, “to fire under water in a medium eight hundred and fifty-five times denser than the air, we must conquer very considerable resistance.”","“Even so,” I said, “to fire underwater in a medium that's 855 times denser than air, you would have to overcome considerable resistance.”"
Je saisis d’une main le bras de mon fidèle Conseil.,I grasp the arm of my faithful Council with one hand.,I seized the arm of my faithful Conseil.,I seized with one hand my faithful Conseil’s arm.,I reached out and clutched my loyal Conseil by the arm.

"A demi étendu sur un divan de la bibliothèque, je suffoquais. Ma face était violette, mes lèvres bleues, mes facultés suspendues. Je ne voyais plus, je n’entendais plus. La notion du temps avait disparu de mon esprit. Mes muscles ne pouvaient se contracter.","Half stretched out on a divan in the library, I was suffocating.

"Le capitaine Nemo retourna à bord. Conseil et moi, nous restâmes jusqu’à cinq heures à arpenter la plage, observant et étudiant. Je ne récoltai aucun objet curieux, si ce n’est un œuf de pingouin, remarquable par sa grosseur, et qu’un amateur eût payé plus de mille francs. Sa couleur isabelle, les raies et les caractères qui l’ornaient comme autant d’hiéroglyphes, en faisaient un bibelot rare. Je le remis entre les mains de Conseil, et le prudent garçon, au pied sûr, le tenant comme une précieuse porcelaine de Chine, le rapporta intact au Nautilus.","Captain Nemo returned on board. Conseil and I stayed up and down the beach until five o'clock, observing and studying. I did not collect any curious object, except a penguin's egg, remarkable for its size, and which an amateur would have paid more than a thousand francs.

I handed it over to Conseil, and the prudent boy, sure-footed, holding it like precious china, brought it back intact to the Nautilus.","Captain Nemo returned on board.

"En ce moment, le second attira de nouveau l’attention du capitaine. Celui-ci suspendit sa promenade et dirigea sa lunette vers le point indiqué. Il l’observa longtemps. De mon côté, très sérieusement intrigué, je descendis au salon, et j’en rapportai une excellente longue-vue dont je me servais ordinairement. Puis, l’appuyant sur la cage du fanal qui formait saillie à l’avant de la plate-forme, je me disposai à parcourir toute la ligne du ciel et de la mer.","At this moment the mate again attracted the captain's attention. The latter suspended his walk and directed his telescope towards the point indicated. He watched her for a long time. For my part, very seriously intrigued, I went down to the drawing-room and brought back an excellent telescope which I usually used. Then, leaning it on the cage of the lantern which formed a projection at the front of the platform, I prepared to cover the whole line of the sky and the sea.","Now the first officer again drew his chief’s attention to something. The captain stopped pacing, and directed his telescope at the point indicated. He examined it for a long time. For my part, fascinated, I went down to the salon to fetch the excellent telescope I normally used. Then, leaning on the framework of the searchlight projecting near the front of the platform,* I prepared to study the whole line of sea and sky.","Just then the lieutenant drew the captain’s attention again. The latter stopped walking and directed his glass toward the place indicated. He looked long. I felt very much puzzled, and descended to the drawing-room and took out an excellent telescope that I generally used. Then, leaning on the cage of the watch-light, that jutted out from the front of the platform, set myself to look over all the line of the sky and sea.","Just then the chief officer drew the captain's attention once again. The latter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass at the place indicated. He studied it a good while. As for me, I was deeply puzzled, went below to the lounge, and fetched an excellent long-range telescope that I often used. Leaning my elbows on the beacon housing, which jutted from the stern of the platform, I got set to scour that whole stretch of sky and sea."
"Cependant, cette recherche inutile ne pouvait se prolonger plus longtemps. L’Abraham-Lincoln n’avait rien à se reprocher, ayant tout fait pour réussir. Jamais équipage d’un bâtiment de la marine américaine ne montra plus de patience et plus de zèle ; son insuccès ne saurait lui être imputé ; il ne restait plus qu’à revenir.","However, this useless search could not continue any longer. The Abraham-Lincoln had nothing to be ashamed of, having done everything to succeed. Never did the crew of a ship in the American Navy show more patience and more zeal; his failure cannot be imputed to him; all that remained was to return.","In fact this fruitless search could not go on any longer. The Abraham Lincoln could have no reason to reproach itself, having done its utmost to ensure success. Never had an American Navy crew shown more patience or energy, and the failure could not be blamed on anyone. There now remained no choice but to go home.","This useless search could not last much longer. The Abraham Lincoln had nothing to reproach herself with, she had done her best to succeed. Never had an American ship’s crew shown more zeal or patience; its failure could not be placed to their charge—there remained nothing but to return.",But this pointless search couldn't drag on much longer. The Abraham Lincoln had done everything it could to succeed and hadn't any reason to blame itself. Never had the crew of an American naval vessel shown more patience and zeal; they weren't responsible for this failure; there was nothing left to do but go home.
"Mais le Nautilus n’eut rien à démêler avec ces vilains animaux. Timor ne fut visible qu’un instant, à midi, pendant que le second relevait sa position. Également, je ne fis qu’entrevoir cette petite île Rotti, qui fait partie du groupe, et dont les femmes ont une réputation de beauté très établie sur les marchés malais.","But the Nautilus had nothing to do with these ugly animals. Timor was only visible for a moment, at noon, while the mate took up his position. Also, I only caught a glimpse of this little island Rotti, which is part of the group, and whose women have a very established reputation for beauty in the Malaysian markets.","But the Nautilus did not have to deal with these ugly animals. Timor was visible for a mere moment at noon, while the first officer was determining our position. In the same way, I caught only a glimpse of the little island of Roti, part of the same group, whose women have a firmly established reputation for beauty on the Malaysian markets.","On the 13th of January, Captain Nemo arrived in the Sea of Timor, and recognized the island of that name in 122° longitude.","But the Nautilus didn't want anything to do with these nasty animals. Timor Island was visible for only a second at noon while the chief officer took our position. I likewise barely caught a glimpse of little Roti Island, part of this same group, whose women have a well-established reputation for beauty in the marketplaces of Malaysia."
"Longtemps encore, je serais resté à ma vitre, admirant les beautés de la mer et du ciel, quand les panneaux se refermèrent. A ce moment, le Nautilus était arrivé à l’aplomb de la haute muraille. Comment manœuvrerait-il, je ne pouvais le deviner. Je regagnai ma chambre. Le Nautilus ne bougeait plus. Je m’endormis avec la ferme intention de me réveiller après quelques heures de sommeil.","I would have remained at my window for a long time still, admiring the beauty of the sea and the sky, when the panels closed. At this moment, the Nautilus had arrived directly above the high wall. How he would maneuver, I couldn't guess. I returned to my room. The Nautilus was no longer moving. I fell asleep with the firm intention of waking up after a few hours of sleep.","I would have stayed at my glass for a long time yet, admiring the beauties of the sea and the sky, but the panels suddenly closed. At this moment the Nautilus had just arrived at the high vertical wall. How it would manoeuvre I could not guess. I went back to my room. The Nautilus was no longer moving. I fell asleep with the firm intention of waking up after a few hours.","Much longer should I have remained at the window, admiring the beauties of sea and sky, but the panels closed. At this moment the Nautilus arrived at the side of this high perpendicular wall. What it would do I could not guess. I returned to my room; it no longer moved. I laid myself down with the full intention of waking after a few hours’ sleep, but it was eight o’clock the next day when I entered the saloon.","I would have stayed much longer at my window, marveling at these beauties of sea and sky, but the panels closed. Just then the Nautilus had arrived at the vertical face of that high wall. I hadn't a clue what the ship would do next. I retired to my stateroom. The Nautilus didn't stir. I fell asleep with the firm intention of waking up in a couple of hours."
"Quelle lutte ! Ned Land lui-même, bientôt enthousiasmé, finit par battre des mains. Le Nautilus n’était plus qu’un harpon formidable, brandi par la main de son capitaine. Il se lançait contre ces masses charnues et les traversait de part en part, laissant après son passage deux grouillantes moitiés d’animal. Les formidables coups de queue qui frappaient ses flancs, il ne les sentait pas. Les chocs qu’il produisait, pas davantage. Un cachalot exterminé, il courait à un autre, virait sur place pour ne pas manquer sa proie, allant de l’avant, de l’arrière, docile à son gouvernail, plongeant quand le cétacé s’enfonçait dans les couches profondes, remontant avec lui lorsqu’il revenait à la surface, le frappant de plein ou d’écharpe, le coupant ou le déchirant, et dans toutes les directions et sous toutes les allures, le perçant de son terrible éperon.","What a struggle! Ned Land himself, soon enthusiastic, finally clapped his hands. The Nautilus was no more than a formidable harpoon, brandished by the hand of its captain. It hurled itself against these fleshy masses and crossed them from side to side, leaving after its passage two swarming animal halves. The formidable strokes of the tail which struck his flanks, he did not feel them. The shocks it produced, no more. One sperm whale exterminated, it ran to another, veered on the spot so as not to miss its prey, going forwards, backwards, docile to its rudder, diving when the cetacean sank into the deep layers, ascending with him when he came back to the surface, striking him full or with a slash, cutting him or tearing him, and in all directions and at all speeds, piercing him with his terrible spur.","What a battle! Ned Land himself quickly became enthusiastic, and ended up clapping. In the captain’s hands, the Nautilus had become a formidable harpoon. It threw itself at the fleshy masses, cutting right through the animals, leaving behind two flailing halves. The Nautilus was insensible to the frightening blows from the tails striking its sides. Nor did our vessel heed the impacts from its own efforts. Once one sperm whale had been killed, it chased after the next one, or turned on the spot so as to find its new prey: manoeuvring back and forth under the direction of the helm, diving when a cetacean plunged into the depths, coming back up when it surfaced, smashing into it head-on or obliquely, cutting or tearing, striking from every direction and at any speed, skewering with the terrifying ram.","What a battle! The Nautilus was nothing but a formidable harpoon, brandished by the hand of its captain. It hurled itself against the fleshy mass, passing through from one part to the other, leaving behind it two quivering halves of the animal. It could not feel the formidable blows from their tails upon its sides, nor the shock which it produced itself, much more. One cachalot killed, it ran at the next, tacked on the spot that it might not miss its prey, going forward and backward, answering to its helm, plunging when the cetacean dived into the deep waters, coming up with it when it returned to the surface, striking it front or sideways, cutting or tearing in all directions, and at any pace, piercing it with its terrible spur.","What a fight! Ned Land quickly grew enthusiastic and even ended up applauding. Brandished in its captain's hands, the Nautilus was simply a fearsome harpoon. He hurled it at those masses of flesh and ran them clean through, leaving two squirming animal halves. Their fearsome tails would slam against our hull, but the submersible barely felt them. No more than the collisions we caused. After exterminating one sperm whale, the shipraced after another, turned on a dime so as to not miss its prey, went ahead or astern, obeyed its rudder, made a dive when the cetacean sank to deeper strata, rose with it when it returned to the surface, struck it head-on or slantwise, hacked at it or ripped it, and from any direction or at any speed impaled it with that dreadful spur."
"— Donc, à moins que vous ne remplissiez le Nautilus en entier, je ne vois pas comment vous pouvez l’entraîner au sein des masses liquides.","""So unless you fill the Nautilus completely, I don't see how you can drag it into the liquid masses.","‘So unless you fill the Nautilus entirely, I do not see how you can make it go down into the depths.’","“Then unless you quite fill the Nautilus, I do not see how you can draw it down to those depths.”","“Then unless you fill up the whole Nautilus, I don't see how you can drive it down through those masses of liquid.”"
"Le Nautilus ne songeait pas a frapper le deux-ponts dans son impénétrable cuirasse, mais au-dessous de sa ligne de flottaison, là ou la carapace métallique ne protège plus le bordé.","The Nautilus did not dream of hitting the two-decker in its impenetrable armor, but below its waterline, where the metal shell no longer protects the planking.","The Nautilus was not planning to strike the impenetrable armour of the double-decker, but the section below its flotation line, where a metal sheath no longer protected the planking.","The Nautilus did not wish to strike at the impenetrable cuirass, but below the water-line, where the metallic covering no longer protected it.","The Nautilus had no intention of striking the doubledecker where it was clad in impregnable iron armor, but below its waterline, where that metal carapace no longer protected its planking."
— Sans inconvénient. Nous ne marchons plus. »,- Without inconvenience. We don't walk anymore. »,‘Certainly. We are not moving.’,Captain Nemo went out.,“Without any ill effect. We're no longer in motion.”
"— Il s’agissait alors de procurer de la viande fraîche à mon équipage. Ici, ce serait tuer pour tuer. Je sais bien que c’est un privilège réservé à l’homme, mais je n’admets pas ces passe-temps meurtriers. En détruisant la baleine australe comme la baleine franche, êtres inoffensifs et bons, vos pareils, maître Land, commettent une action blâmable. C’est ainsi qu’ils ont déjà dépeuplé toute la baie de Baffin, et qu’ils anéantiront une classe d’animaux utiles. Laissez donc tranquilles ces malheureux cétacés. Ils ont bien assez de leurs ennemis naturels, les cachalots, les espadons et les scies, sans que vous vous en mêliez. »","“It was a question then of procuring fresh meat for my crew. Here, it would be killing to kill. I know it's a male privilege, but I don't condone these murderous pastimes. By destroying the southern whale like the right whale, harmless and good beings, your fellows, Master Land, commit a blameworthy deed. This is how they have already depopulated all of Baffin Bay, and how they will wipe out a class of useful animals. Leave these unfortunate cetaceans alone. They have enough of their natural enemies, sperm whales, swordfish and sawfish, without you getting involved. »","‘We needed fresh meat for my crew. Here, it would be killing for killing’s sake. I realize that it is one of man’s privileges, but I cannot condone these murderous pastimes. By destroying the Antarctic whale like the right whale, inoffensive and good creatures as they are, your fellows commit a damnable action, Master Land. They have already emptied the whole of Baffin Bay, and will eventually destroy a class of useful animals. So leave the unfortunate whales in peace. They already have enough problems with their natural enemies,* the sperm whales, the swordfish, and the sawfish, without you interfering.’","“Then it was to procure fresh meat for my crew. Here it would be killing for killing’s sake. I know that is a privilege reserved for man, but I do not approve of such murderous pastime. In destroying the southern whale (like the Greenland whale, an inoffensive creature), your traders do a culpable action, Master Land. They have already depopulated the whole of Baffin’s Bay, and are annihilating a class of useful animals. Leave the unfortunate cetacea alone. They have plenty of natural enemies—cachalots, swordfish, and sawfish—without your troubling them.”","“There it was a matter of getting fresh meat for my crew. Here it would be killing just for the sake of killing. I'm well aware that's a privilege reserved for mankind, but I won't tolerate such bloodthirsty pastimes. When your colleagues, Mr. Land, destroy decent, harmless creatures like the southern right whale or the bowhead whale, they're guilty of criminal behavior. Consequently they've already eradicated the stock in Baffin Bay and they'll ultimately wipe out a whole class of beneficial animals. So leave those poor cetaceans alone. They have quite enough natural enemies, such as sperm whales, swordfish, and sawfish, without your meddling with them.”"

"Je compris son épouvante. Une ombre gigantesque apparaissait au-dessus du malheureux plongeur. C’était un requin de grande taille qui s’avançait diagonalement, l’œil en feu, les mâchoires ouvertes !","I understood his horror. A gigantic shadow appeared above the unfortunate diver. It was a large shark advancing diagonally, eyes on fire, jaws open!","I understood his terror. a gigantic shadow had appeared above the unfortunate diver. It was a large shark, swimming diagonally: eyes flaming and jaws wide open!","I understood his dread. A gigantic shadow appeared just above the unfortunate diver. It was a shark of enormous size advancing diagonally, his eyes on fire, and his jaws open.","I understood his fear. A gigantic shadow appeared above the poor diver. It was a shark of huge size, moving in diagonally, eyes fiery, jaws wide open!"
"Et me voilà rêvant de requins, songeant à ces vastes mâchoires armées de multiples rangées de dents, et capables de couper un homme en deux. Je me sentais déjà une certaine douleur autour des reins.

I already felt some pain around the kidneys. Then, I could not digest the lack of way with which the captain had made this deplorable invitation!

I already felt the pain around my middle section. Also, I could not digest the casual way in which the captain had made the deplorable invitation! Would one not have put it that way if we were going to track some inoffensive fox through the woods?","However, I am not a negro, and, if I were, I think a little hesitation in this case would not be ill-timed.”","And there I was, daydreaming about sharks, envisioning huge jaws armed with multiple rows of teeth and capable of biting a man in half.

"Entre autres, je remarquai ces gobies aphyses, citées par Aristote et vulgairement connues sous le nom de « loches de mer », que l’on rencontre particulièrement dans les eaux salées avoisinant le delta du Nil. Près d’elles se déroulaient des pagres à demi phosphorescents, sortes de spares que les Égyptiens rangeaient parmi les animaux sacrés, et dont l’arrivée dans les eaux du Reuve, dont elles annonçaient le fécond débordement, était fêtée par des cérémonies religieuses. Je notai également des cheilines longues de trois décimètres, poissons osseux à écailles transparentes, dont la couleur livide est mélangée de taches rouges ; ce sont de grands mangeurs de végétaux marins, ce qui leur donne un goût exquis ; aussi ces cheilines étaient-elles très recherchées des gourmets de l’ancienne Rome, et leurs entrailles, accommodées avec des laites de murènes, des cervelles de paons et des langues de phénicoptères, composaient ce plat divin qui ravissait Vitellius.","Among others, I noticed these aphysean gobies, mentioned by Aristotle and commonly known as ""sea loaches"", which are found particularly in the salt waters around the Nile delta. Near them unrolled half-phosphorescent pagres, sorts of spares which the Egyptians ranged among the sacred animals, and whose arrival in the waters of the Reuve, of which they announced the fruitful overflow, was celebrated by religious ceremonies. I also noted cheilines three decimetres long, bony fish with transparent scales, whose livid color is mixed with red spots; they are great eaters of marine plants, which gives them an exquisite taste; also these cheilines were much sought after by the gourmets of ancient Rome, and their entrails, accommodated with the milk of moray eels, the brains of peacocks and the tongues of phenicoptera, composed this divine dish which delighted Vitellius.","Amongst others, I noticed those aphid gobies cited by Aristotle, vulgarly known as ‘sea slugs’, which are especially encountered in the salt water around the Nile Delta. Near them meandered some half-phosphorescent sea bream, a type of sparid which the Egyptians considered sacred: their arrival in the waters of the river, whose fertile overflowing they heralded, was celebrated in religious ceremonies. I noticed also some Cheilini 30 centimetres long, bony fish with transparent scales whose pale skin is marked with red spots; they are great devourers of marine vegetation, which gives them an exquisite taste. Accordingly these Cheilini were very much sought after by the gourmets of ancient Rome, and their entrails, cooked with milt from moray eels, peacock brain, and flamingo tongues, made up that divine dish which delighted Vitellius. *","Among others, I remarked some gobies, mentioned by Aristotle, and commonly known by the name of sea-braches which are more particularly met with in the salt waters lying near the Delta of the Nile. Near them rolled some seabream, half-phosphorescent, a kind of sparus, which the Egyptians ranked among their sacred animals, whose arrival in the waters of their river announced a fertile overflow, and was celebrated by religious ceremonies. I also noticed some cheilines about nine inches long, a bony fish with transparent shell, whose livid color is mixed with red spots; they are great eaters of marine vegetation, which gives them an exquisite flavor. These cheilines were much sought after by the epicures of ancient Rome; the inside, dressed with the soft roe of the lamprey, peacocks’ brains, and tongues of the phenicoptera, composed that divine dish of which Vitellius was so enamored.","Among others I noted the three-bearded rockling that Aristotle mentions—it's popularly known by the name sea loach and is characteristically found in the salty waters next to the Nile Delta. Nearby some semi-phosphorescent porgy were going past, a type of sea bream that the Egyptians listed with their sacred animals, honoring them in religious ceremonies when their arrival in the Nile's waters announced the fertile flood season. I likewise noted some foot-long wrasse, bony fish with transparent scales whose bluish gray color is mingled with red spots; they're enthusiastic eaters of marine vegetables, which gives them an exquisite flavor; accordingly these wrasse were much in demand among the epicures of ancient Rome, and their entrails were dressed with brains of peacock, tongue of flamingo, and testes of moray to make the divine platter that enraptured the Roman emperor Vitellius."
"Je ne fis donc aucune allusion à cet événement, lorsque, le soir, je me trouvai seul avec lui dans le salon. D’ailleurs, il me sembla taciturne, préoccupé.

The Nautilus resumed its underwater navigating; but at the moment of our noon sights, the sea was deserted and the ship rose to its waterline again."
"Nous dûmes alors redescendre vers le rivage, car la crête devenait impraticable. Au-dessus de nous, le cratère béant apparaissait comme une large ouverture de puits. De cette place, le ciel se laissait distinguer assez nettement, et je voyais courir des nuages échevelés par le vent d’ouest, qui laissaient traîner jusqu’au sommet de la montagne leurs brumeux haillons. Preuve certaine que ces nuages se tenaient à une hauteur médiocre, car le volcan ne s’élevait pas à plus de huit cents pieds au-dessus du niveau de l’Océan.","We then had to go back down to the shore, because the ridge was becoming impassable. Above us, the gaping crater appeared like a wide shaft opening. From this place the sky could be seen quite clearly, and I could see clouds rushing by, disheveled by the west wind, which trailed their misty rags to the summit of the mountain. Certain proof that these clouds stood at a moderate height, for the volcano did not rise more than eight hundred feet above the level of the ocean.","We had to climb down towards the shore again, for the crest was becoming impassable. Above us, the gaping crater appeared like the wide opening of a well. From where we were the sky could be made out quite clearly; I could see dishevelled clouds running before the west wind, leaving their misty shreds behind on the summit of the mountain. They must have been at a low altitude, for the volcano did not rise more than 800 feet above sea level.","We were now obliged to descend toward the shore, the crest becoming impracticable. Above us the crater seemed to gape like the mouth of a well. From this place the sky could be clearly seen, and clouds, dissipated by the west wind, leaving behind them, even on the summit of the mountain, their misty remnants—certain proof that they were only moderately high, for the volcano did not rise more than eight hundred feet above the level of the ocean.","By then we were forced to go back down to the beach, because the ridge had become impossible to climb. Above us that yawning crater looked like the mouth of a huge well. The sky was pretty easy to make out from where we stood, and I watched some clouds race by, disheveled by the west wind, letting tatters of mist trail over the mountaintop. Proof positive that those clouds were only moderately high up, because this volcano didn't risemore than 1,800 feet above the level of the ocean."
"Et, pour être franc, j’avouerai que cette excursion aventureuse ne me déplaisait point. A quel degré m’émerveillaient les beautés de ces régions nouvelles, je ne saurais l’exprimer. Les glaces prenaient des attitudes superbes. Ici, leur ensemble formait une ville orientale, avec ses minarets et ses mosquées innombrables. Là, une cité écroulée et comme jetée à terre par une convulsion du sol. Aspects incessamment variés par les obliques rayons du soleil, ou perdus dans les brumes grises au milieu des ouragans de neige. Puis, de toutes parts des détonations, des éboulements, de grandes culbutes d’icebergs, qui changeaient le décor comme le paysage d’un diorama.","And, to be frank, I must admit that this adventurous excursion did not displease me. To what degree I marveled at the beauties of these new regions, I cannot express. The mirrors assumed superb attitudes. Here, their whole formed an oriental city, with its innumerable minarets and mosques. There, a city collapsed and as if thrown to the ground by a convulsion of the ground. Aspects incessantly varied by the oblique rays of the sun, or lost in the gray mists in the midst of hurricanes of snow. Then, on all sides, explosions, landslides, great tumbles of icebergs, which changed the scenery like the landscape of a diorama.","And to be frank, I have to admit that this adventurous expedition rather pleased me. I cannot express how much the beauty of these new regions entranced me. The ice took on fantastic perspectives. Here it seemed to form an oriental town with its countless minarets and mosques, there a city that had collapsed, thrown down by an earthquake. Views were constantly varied by the oblique sunlight, or became lost in the grey mists of snowy dawns. From every side, explosions, landslides, and great inversions of icebergs changed the background, like the countryside in a diorama.","I cannot express my astonishment at the beauties of these new regions. The ice took most surprising forms. Here the grouping formed an Oriental town, with innumerable mosques and minarets, there a fallen city thrown to the earth, as it were, by some convulsion of nature. The whole aspect was constantly changed by the oblique rays of the sun, or lost in the grayish fog amid hurricanes of snow. Detonations and falls were heard on all sides, great overthrows of icebergs, which altered the whole landscape like a diorama.37 Often seeing no exit, I thought we were definitively prisoners; but instinct guiding him at the slightest indication, Captain Nemo would discover a new pass.","And to tell the truth, this venturesome excursion didn't displease me one bit. I can't express how amazed I was at the beauties of these new regions. The ice struck wondrous poses. Here, it looked like a town in the Far East with countless minarets and mosques. There, a city in ruins, demolished by upheavals in the earth. These views kept changing as the sunlight hit them at different angles, or they were swallowed up completely by gray fogs during blizzards. Then explosions, caveins, and great iceberg somersaults would take place aroundus, varying the scenery like the shifting landscape in a diorama."

"De mer, de surface liquide, il n’y avait plus apparence devant nos yeux. Sous l’éperon du Nautilus s’étendait une vaste plaine tourmentée, enchevêtrée de blocs confus, avec tout ce pêle-mêle capricieux qui caractérise la surface d’un fleuve quelque temps avant la débâcle des glaces, mais sur des proportions gigantesques. Çà et là, des pics aigus, des aiguilles déliées s’élevant à une hauteur de deux cents pieds ; plus loin, une suite de falaises taillées à pic et revêtues de teintes grisâtres, vastes miroirs qui reflétaient quelques rayons de soleil à demi noyés dans les brumes. Puis, sur cette nature désolée, un silence farouche, à peine rompu par le battement d’ailes des pétrels ou des puffins. Tout était gelé alors, même le bruit.","Of sea, of liquid surface, there was no longer any appearance before our eyes. Beneath the spur of the Nautilus stretched a vast tormented plain, entangled with confused blocks, with all that capricious pell-mell which characterizes the surface of a river some time before the break-up of the ice, but on gigantic proportions. Here and there sharp peaks, slender needles rising to a height of two hundred feet; farther on, a series of sheer cliffs covered in greyish tints, vast mirrors which reflected a few rays of sunlight half drowned in the mist. Then, over this desolate nature, a fierce silence, barely broken by the flapping wings of petrels or shearwaters. Everything was frozen then, even the noise.","Before our eyes there was no longer any sign of sea or of any liquid. A vast tormented plain stretched beyond the ram of the Nautilus, tangled, confused blocks, with all the capricious chaos that characterizes the surface of a river well before the ice starts to break up, but hugely magnified. Sharp peaks like slender needles rose here and there to a height of 200 feet; and a succession of cliffs, cut sheer and shaded in greyish tints, formed vast mirrors reflecting the few rays of sunlight, half drowned in the mist. Over this desolate nature loomed a savage silence, hardly broken by the petrels’ and shearwaters’ beating wings. Everything was frozen, even sound.","Of the liquid surface of the sea there was no longer a glimpse. Under the spur of the Nautilus lay stretched a vast plain, entangled with confused blocks.

"« Oui, dit-il, l’Océan possède une circulation véritable, et, pour la provoquer, il a suffi au Créateur de toutes choses de multiplier en lui le calorique, le sel et les animalcules. Le calorique, en effet, crée des densités différentes, qui amènent les courants et les contre-courants. L’évaporation, nulle aux régions hyperboréennes, très active dans les zones équatoriales, constitue un échange permanent des eaux tropicales et des eaux polaires. En outre, j’ai surpris ces courants de haut en bas et de bas en haut, qui forment la vraie respiration de l’Océan. J’ai vu la molécule d’eau de mer, échauffée à la surface, redescendre vers les profondeurs, atteindre son maximum de densité à deux degrés au-dessous de zéro, puis se refroidissant encore, devenir plus légère et remonter. Vous verrez, aux pôles, les conséquences de ce phénomène, et vous comprendrez pourquoi, par cette loi de la prévoyante nature, la congélation ne peut jamais se produire qu’à la surface des eaux ! »","""Yes,"" he said, ""the ocean possesses a real circulation, and, to bring it about, it sufficed for the Creator of all things to multiply within it caloric, salt, and animalcules. Caloric, in fact, creates different densities, which bring currents and counter-currents. Evaporation, zero in the hyperborean regions, very active in the equatorial zones, constitutes a permanent exchange of tropical waters and polar waters. Moreover, I surprised these currents from top to bottom and from bottom to top, which form the true breath of the Ocean. I saw the molecule of sea water, heated on the surface, descend again towards the depths, reach its maximum density at two degrees below zero, then cool again, become lighter and rise again. You will see, at the poles, the consequences of this phenomenon, and you will understand why, by this law of provident nature, freezing can never occur except on the surface of the waters! »","‘Yes,’ he said, ‘the ocean has a real circulation, and to start it off, the Creator of all things merely had to increase the caloric,* salt, and animalculae in it. The caloric produces different densities, which then create currents and counter-currents. Evaporation is negligible in the polar regions but very swift in the tropical zones, and so produces a permanent interchange between the tropical and polar waters. I have also been able to detect currents going from top to bottom and back up again, which truly form the ocean’s respiration. I have observed molecules of salt water heating up on the surface, descending towards the depths, reaching their maximum density at -2°, then cooling further, becoming lighter and starting to move back up again. You will see the consequences of this phenomenon at the Poles,* and you will understand why, through this law of far-sighted nature, ice can form only on the surface of the waters!’","“Yes, the ocean has indeed circulation, and to promote it, the Creator has caused things to multiply in it—caloric, salt, and animalculæ.”","“Yes,” he said, “the ocean has an authentic circulation, and to trigger it, the Creator of All Things had only to increase its heat, salt, and microscopic animal life. In essence heat creates the different densities that cause currents and countercurrents. Evaporation, which is nonexistent in the High Arctic regions and very active in equatorial zones, produces a continual exchange of tropical waters with polar waters. What's more, I've detected those rising and falling currents that make the ocean actually seem to be breathing. I've seen a molecule of salt water heat up at the surface, sink back into the depths, reach maximum density at 28° Fahrenheit, then cool off, grow lighter, and rise again. At the poles you'll note the consequences of this phenomenon, and thanks to this law of far-seeing nature, you'll understand why water can freeze only at the surface!”"

"— Encore moins, Ned. Le poulpe n’est qu’un mollusque, et ce nom même indique le peu de consistance de ses chairs. Eût-il cinq cents pieds de longueur, le poulpe, qui n’appartient point à l’embranchement des vertébrés, est tout à fait inoffensif pour des navires tels que le Scotia ou l’Abraham-Lincoln. Il faut donc rejeter au rang des fables les prouesses des Krakens ou autres monstres de cette espèce.","“Even less, Ned. The octopus is only a mollusk, and this very name indicates the lack of consistency of its flesh. Even if it were five hundred feet in length, the octopus, which does not belong to the phylum Vertebrates, is quite harmless to ships such as the Scotia or the Abraham-Lincoln. We must therefore reject the rank of fables the prowess of the Krakens or other monsters of this species.","‘Even less likely. The squid is only a mollusc; and its flesh is soft, as that very term implies. Even if it were 500 feet long, the squid wouldn’t belong to the branch of vertebrates, and so remains perfectly harmless to ships like the Scotia or Abraham Lincoln. We must therefore relegate all feats of krakens and suchlike monsters to the realm of fable.’","“Wooden ships—that is possible,” replied the Canadian; “but I have never seen it done; and, until further proof, I deny that whales, cetaceans, or sea-unicorns could ever produce the effect you describe.”","“Even less likely, Ned. A devilfish is simply a mollusk, and this name in itself hints at its semiliquid flesh because it's Latin meaning soft one. Devilfish don't belong to the vertebrate branch, and even if one were 500 feet long, it still couldn't do the slightest harm to ships like the Scotia or the Abraham Lincoln. Consequently the feats of krakens or other monsters of that ilk must be relegated to the realm of fish stories.”"

"Il était alors dix heures du matin.

If only I'd been able to tell Conseil about the vivid sensations rising in my brain, matching him in exclamations of wonderment! If only I'd known how to communicate in that sign language used by Captain Nemo and his companion! Accordingly, having nothing better to do, I talked to myself, orating inside that brass container over my head, foolishly wasting my air on empty words."

"Alors j’en vins à me demander si cet étrange personnage était à bord. Depuis cette nuit pendant laquelle le canot avait quitté le Nautilus pour un service mystérieux, mes idées s’étaient, en ce qui le concerne, légèrement modifiées. Je pensais, bien qu’il eût pu dire, que le capitaine Nemo devait avoir conservé avec la terre quelques relations d’une certaine espèce. Ne quittait-il jamais le Nautilus ? Des semaines entières s’étaient souvent écoulées sans que je l’eusse rencontré. Que faisait-il pendant ce temps, et alors que je le croyais en proie à des accès de misanthropie, n’accomplissait-il pas au loin quelque acte secret dont la nature m’échappait jusqu’ici ?","So I came to wonder if this strange character was on board. Since that night when the lifeboat had left the Nautilus on some mysterious service, my ideas about him had changed slightly. I thought, though he might have said, that Captain Nemo must have retained some kind of connection with the land. Did he ever leave the Nautilus? Whole weeks had often passed without my having met him. What was he doing during this time, and while I believed him to be a prey to fits of misanthropy, was he not accomplishing some secret act in the distance, the nature of which escaped me so far?","I wondered if this strange character was even still on board. Since that night when the dinghy had left the Nautilus on a mysterious errand, my ideas about him had changed a little. I believed that whatever Captain Nemo said, he must maintain relations of some sort with dry land. Did he ever leave the Nautilus? Entire weeks had often gone by without my seeing him at all. What did he do during this time? Whilst I had believed him to be in the grip of spells of misanthropy, could he not have been far away carrying out some secret mission of which I had no inkling?",No sound reached my ear. I felt an unbearable uneasiness.,"Then I began to wonder if this strange individual was actually on board. Since that night when the skiff had left the Nautilus on some secret errand, my ideas about him had subtly changed. In spite of everything I thought Captain Nemo must have kept up some sort of relationship with the shore. Did he ever leave the Nautilus? Whole weeks had often gone by without my seeing him. What was he doing at those times? On the occasions when I'd thought he was in seclusion due to his basic distrust of humanity, was he instead far away from the ship, involved in some secret activity whose nature still eluded me?"

"En prolongeant à quelques encablures seulement les accores de l’île Clermont-Tonnerre, j’admirai l’ouvrage gigantesque, accompli par ces travailleurs microscopiques. Ces murailles étaient spécialement l’œuvre des madréporaires désignés par les noms de millepores, de porites, d’astrées et de méandrines. Ces polypes se développent particulièrement dans les couches agitées de la surface de la mer, et par conséquent, c’est par leur partie supérieure qu’ils commencent ces substructions, lesquelles s’enfoncent peu à peu avec les débris de sécrétions qui les supportent. Telle est, du moins, la théorie de M. Darwin, qui explique ainsi la formation des atolls – théorie supérieure, selon moi, à celle qui donne pour base aux travaux madréporiques des sommets de montagnes ou de volcans, immergés à quelques pieds au-dessous du niveau de la mer.","By extending just a few cable lengths from the edges of Clermont-Tonnerre Island, I admired the gigantic work accomplished by these microscopic workers. These walls were especially the work of the madreporaries designated by the names of millepores, porites, astrées and méandrines. These polyps develop particularly in the agitated layers of the surface of the sea, and consequently, it is by their upper part that they begin these substructures, which sink little by little with the debris of secretions which support them. Such, at least, is the theory of Mr. Darwin, who thus explains the formation of the atolls—a superior theory, in my opinion, to that which gives as a basis for madreporic works the summits of mountains or volcanoes, immersed a few feet above below sea level.","While we worked our way along the shores of Reao at a distance of only a few cables, I admired the gigantic task completed by these microscopic workers. The walls were mainly the work of the madrepores known as millepores, porites, astrea, and meandrines. These polyps develop particularly in the rough waters near the surface, and consequently they start their foundations at the top, which then gradually sink down together with the remains of the secretions holding them together. Such at least is the theory of Mr Darwin,* who explains in this way the formation of atolls — a better theory, in my view, than positing that the madrepores build on the summits of volcanoes or mountains submerged a few feet below sea level.","Some cable-lengths off the shores of the island of Clermont , I admired the gigantic work accomplished by these microscopical workers. These walls are especially the work of those madrepores known as milleporas, porites, and astræas, These polypi are found particularly in the rough beds of the sea, near the surface; and consequently it is from the upper part that they begin their operations in which they bury themselves by degrees with the debris of the secretions that support them. Such is, at least, Darwin’s theory, who thus explains the formation of the atolls,30 a superior theory (to my mind) to that given of the foundation of the madreporical works, summits of mountains or volcanoes, that are submerged some feet below the level of the sea.","While cruising about a quarter of a mile from the underpinnings of Reao Island, I marveled at the gigantic piece of work accomplished by these microscopic laborers. These walls were the express achievements of madrepores going by the names fire coral, finger coral, star coral, and cauliflower coral. These polyps grow exclusively in the agitated strata at the surface of the sea, and so it's in the upper reaches that they start these support structures, which gradually sink along with the secreted rubble binding them. At least that's the theory of Mr. Charles Darwin, who explains the formation of atolls in this manner—a theory superior, in my view, to the one that says these madreporic edifices sit on volcanoes or mountain peaks submerged a few feet below sea level."

"Le lendemain, 31 juin, le Nautilus conserva les mêmes allures. Il était évident qu’il cherchait à reconnaître un point précis de l’Océan.

The air was sundered by powerful flashes of lightning. I could not stand the light, but Captain Nemo contemplated them face on, as if drawing the soul of the storm into him. A terrifying noise filled the air, a complex sound composed of the roar of crushed waves, moans from the wind, and peals of thunder.

"Vers cinq heures, une pluie torrentielle tomba, qui n’abattit ni le vent ni la mer. L’ouragan se déchaîna avec une vitesse de quarante-cinq mètres à la seconde, soit près de quarante lieues à l’heure. C’est dans ces conditions qu’il renverse des maisons, qu’il enfonce des tuiles de toits dans des portes, qu’il rompt des grilles de fer, qu’il déplace des canons de vingt-quatre. Et pourtant le Nautilus, au milieu de la tourmente, justifiait cette parole d’un savant ingénieur : « Il n’y a pas de coque bien construite qui ne puisse défier à la mer ! » Ce n’était pas un roc résistant, que ces lames eussent démoli, c’était un fuseau d’acier, obéissant et mobile, sans gréement, sans mâture, qui bravait impunément leur fureur.","Around five o'clock, a torrential rain fell, which did not beat down either the wind or the sea. The hurricane broke out at a speed of forty-five meters per second, or nearly forty leagues per hour. It is under these conditions that he knocks down houses, that he rams roof tiles into doors, that he breaks iron gratings, that he moves twenty-four guns. And yet the Nautilus, in the midst of the storm, justified the words of a learned engineer: ""There is no well-built hull that cannot defy the sea!"" It was not a resistant rock that these blades would have demolished, it was a spindle of steel, obedient and mobile, without rigging, without masts, which defied their fury with impunity.","At about five o’clock, a torrential rain fell, but did not damp down the wind or sea. A hurricane unleashed itself at a speed of 45 metres a second, that is nearly 40 leagues an hour. In such conditions it tears tiles from roofs and smashes them into doors, breaks iron grilles, and bodily moves 24-calibre cannon. And yet even in the midst of the storm the Nautilus bore out the words of a wise engineer: ‘There is no well-constructed hull that cannot withstand the sea!’ This was not a fixed rock, that the waves would have demolished, but a mobile and obedient steel cylinder, without rigging or masts, and so able to resist the fury without suffering any damage.","About five o‘clock a torrent of rain fell, that lulled neither sea nor wind. The hurricane blew nearly forty leagues an hour. It is under these conditions that it overturns houses, breaks iron gates, displaces twenty-four-pounders. However, the Nautilus, in the midst of the tempest, confirmed the words of a clever engineer: “There is no well-constructed hull that cannot defy the sea.” This was not a resisting rock; it was a steel spindle, obedient and movable, without rigging or masts, that braved its fury with impunity.","Around five o'clock a torrential rain fell, but it lulled neither the wind nor the sea. The hurricane was unleashed at a speed of a hundred miles—hence about forty geographic leagues—per hour. Under conditions such as these, houses topple over, iron railings snap in two, flying roof tiles puncture wooden doors, and 24-pounder cannons relocate. And yet in the midst of this turmoil, the Nautilus lived up to that saying by an expert engineer: “A well-built hull can challenge any sea!” This submersible wasn't some stationary boulder that the waves could demolish; it was a steel spindle, agile and obedient, without masts or rigging, and able to brave their fury with impunity."

"La collision de la frégate et du cétacé s’était produite vers onze heures du soir environ. Je comptais donc sur huit heures de nage jusqu’au lever du soleil.

"Six mois durant, la guerre se poursuivit avec des chances diverses.

Ses spirituels écrivains parodiant un mot de Linné, cité par les adversaires du monstre, soutinrent en effet que « la nature ne faisait pas de sots », et ils adjurèrent leurs contemporains de ne point donner un démenti à la nature, en admettant l’existence des Krakens, des serpents de mer, des « Moby Dick », et autres élucubrations de marins en délire. Enfin, dans un article d’un journal satirique très redouté, le plus aimé de ses rédacteurs, brochant sur le tout, poussa au monstre, comme Hippolyte, lui porta un dernier coup et l’acheva au milieu d’un éclat de rire universel. L’esprit avait vaincu la science.","For six months the war continued with varying degrees of success.

Its witty writers parodying a word of Linnaeus, quoted by the adversaries of the monster, indeed maintained that ""nature did not make fools"", and they adjured their contemporaries not to give the lie to nature, admitting the existence Krakens, sea serpents, ""Moby Dicks"", and the other rantings of delirious sailors. Finally, in an article of a much dreaded satirical journal, the most beloved of its editors, broaching on the whole, pushed the monster, like Hippolyte, gave him a last blow and finished him off amidst a universal burst of laughter. . The mind had conquered science.","For six months the war raged back and forth.

These facetious journalists, punning on a saying of Linnaeus’s quoted by the monster’s opponents, argued that ‘nature does not proceed by the lips of bounders’, * and so adjured their contemporaries not to give the lie to nature by admitting the existence of krakens, sea serpents, Moby Dicks, or other lucubrations of crazed sailors. The last straw was an article written for a much-feared satirical newspaper by its most popular writer, who pushed his spurs in like Hippolytus* and delivered a fatal blow to the monster, putting it out of its misery amidst universal laughter. Wit had proved mightier than science.","Editors of scientific journals, quarreling with believers in the supernatural, spilled seas of ink during this memorable campaign, some even drawing blood; for, from the sea-serpent, they came to direct personalities.

The cheaper journals replied keenly and with inexhaustible zest. These satirical writers parodied a remark of Linnæus,5 quoted by the adversaries of the monster, maintaining that “nature did not make fools,” and adjured their contemporaries not to give the lie to nature, by admitting the existence of krakens, sea-serpents, “Moby Dicks,” and other lucubrations of delirious sailors. At length an article in a well-known satirical journal by a favorite contributor, the chief of the staff, settled the monster, like Hippolytus,6 giving it the death-blow amid a universal burst of laughter. Wit had conquered science.","For six months the war seesawed.

When the monster's opponents quoted a saying by the zoologist Linnaeus that “nature doesn't make leaps,” humorous writers in the popular periodicals parodied it, maintaining in essence that “nature doesn't make lunatics,” then ordering their contemporaries to never give the lie to nature by believing in krakens, sea serpents, “Moby Dicks,” and other all-out efforts from drunken seamen. Finally, in a much-feared satirical journal, an article by its most popular columnist squelched the monster for good, attacking it like the old dragon slayer Hippolytus and polishing it off it in the midst of worldwide laughter. Humor had defeated science."

"— Je le ferai, répondit froidement le capitaine Nemo. Ne vous avisez pas de me juger, monsieur. La fatalité vous montre ce que vous ne deviez pas voir. L’attaque est venue. La riposte sera terrible. Rentrez.","""I will,"" replied Captain Nemo coldly. Don't you dare judge me, sir. Fate shows you what you shouldn't see. The attack has come. The response will be terrible.

"Devant ce splendide spectacle, Conseil s’était arrête comme moi. Évidemment, le digne garçon. en présence de ces échantillons de zoophytes et de mollusques, classait, classait toujours. Polypes et échinodermes abondaient sur le sol. Les isis variées, les cornulaires qui vivent isolément, des touffes d’oculines vierges, désignées autrefois sous le nom de « corail blanc », les fongies hérissées en forme de champignons, les anémones adhérant par leur disque musculaire, figuraient un parterre de fleurs, émaillé de porpites parées de leur collerette de tentacules azurés. d’étoiles de mer qui constellaient le sable, et d’astérophytons verruqueux, fines dentelles brodées par la main des naïades, dont les festons se balançaient aux faibles ondulations provoquées par notre marche. C’était un véritable chagrin pour moi d’écraser sous mes pas les brillants spécimens de mollusques qui jonchaient le sol par milliers, les peignes concentriques, les marteaux, les donaces, véritables coquilles bondissantes, les troques, les casques rouges, les strombes aile-d’ange, les aphysies, et tant d’autres produits de cet inépuisable Océan. Mais il fallait marcher, et nous allions en avant, pendant que voguaient au-dessus de nos têtes des troupes de physalies, laissant leurs tentacules d’outre-mer flotter à la traîne, des méduses dont l’ombrelle opaline ou rose tendre, festonnée d’un liston d’azur, nous abritait des rayons solaires, et des pélagies panopyres, qui, dans l’obscurité, eussent semé notre chemin de lueurs phosphorescentes !","Before this splendid spectacle, Conseil stopped like me. Obviously, the worthy boy. in the presence of these samples of zoophytes and molluscs, classified, always classified. Polyps and echinoderms abounded on the floor. Variegated isis, cornulars which live in isolation, tufts of virgin oculins, once called ""white coral"", bristly mushroom-like fungi, anemones clinging by their muscular discs, figured a bed of flowers, enamelled with porpites adorned with their collar of azure tentacles. of starfish which dotted the sand, and of verrucous asterophytons, fine lace embroidered by the hands of naiads, whose festoons swayed in the faint undulations caused by our walk. It was a real sorrow for me to crush under my feet the brilliant specimens of molluscs which strewn the ground by the thousands, the concentric combs, the hammerheads, the donaces, real leaping shells, the troques, the red helmets, the wing conches -d'ange, the aphysias, and so many other products of this inexhaustible Ocean. But we had to walk, and we went ahead, while troops of physalies sailed above our heads, leaving their overseas tentacles floating behind, jellyfish whose opaline or soft pink umbrella, scalloped of a strake of azure, sheltered us from the solar rays, and panopyre pelagies, which, in the darkness, would have sown our path with phosphorescent gleams!","On seeing this splendid spectacle, Conseil had stopped, as had I. Clearly the good chap, in the presence of these representatives of zoophytes and molluscs, was classifying, constantly classifying. Polyps and Echinodermata lay in profusion on the ground. The varied Isidae, the Cornularia which lived in isolation, the clumps of virgin oculinidae formerly called ‘white coral’, the fungus coral bristling like mushrooms, and the anemones adhering by their muscular discs — all constituted a flowerbed, spangled with porpoids and their involucres of blue-tinged tentacles, with starfish studded in the sand, with verrucous astrophytons, a fine lace embroidered by naiads’ hands and whose garlands swung in the slight undulations as we passed. I was unhappy at crushing under my feet the brilliant specimens of molluscs strewn in their thousands, the concentric combshells, the hammer-shells, the donaxes, veritable jumping shells, the top-shells, the red helmets, the angel-wing strombs, the aplysias, and so many other products of the inexhaustible ocean. But we could not stop, and headed on, whilst above our heads sailed the schools of Portuguese men-of-war trailing their ultramarine tentacles, jellyfish whose opaline or delicate rose umbrellas festooned with sky-blue strakes shielded us from the sunlight, and pelagic panopea, which would have sprinkled our path with phosphorescent gleams, had it been dark!","So for want of better, I talked to myself; I declaimed in the copper box which covered my head, thereby expending more air in vain words than was, perhaps, expedient. Various kinds of isis, clusters of pure tuft-coral, prickly fungi, and anemones, formed a brilliant garden of flowers, enameled with porphitæ, decked with their collarettes of blue tentacles, sea-stars studding the sandy bottom, together with asterophytons like fine lace embroidered by the hands of naiads, whose festoons were waved by the gentle undulations caused by our walk. It was a real grief to me to crush under my feet the brilliant specimens of mollusks which strewed the ground by thousands, of hammerheads, donaciae (veritable bounding shells), of staircases, and red helmet-shells, angel-wings, and many others produced by this inexhaustible ocean. But we were bound to walk, so we went on, while above our heads waved shoals of physalides leaving their tentacles to float in their train, medusæ whose umbrellas of opal or rose-pink, escalloped with a band of blue, sheltered us from the rays of the sun, and fiery pelagiæ, which in the darkness would have strewn our path with phosphorescent light.","Conseil, like me, had stopped in front of this splendid sight. In the presence of these zoophyte and mollusk specimens, the fine lad obviously was classifying his heart out. Polyps and echinoderms packed the seafloor. There were various corals: assorted isis, cornularia living in isolation, tufts of virginal genus Oculina formerly known by the name “white coral,” prickly fungus coral shaped like mushrooms, plus sea anemones hanging on by their muscular disks, all making up an authentic flowerbed that was adorned with blue-button jellyfish wearing collars of azure tentacles, with starfish spangling the sand, including warty basket stars from the genus Astrophyton that were like fine lace embroidered by the hands of water nymphs, their festoons swaying in the gentle undulations caused by our walking. It filled me with real regret to crush underfoot the gleaming mollusk specimens that littered the seafloor by the thousands: scallops from the species Pecten concentricus, hammer shells, coquina (seashells that can actually hop around), top shells, red helmet shells, roostertail conchs, sea hares, and so many other items from this inexhaustible ocean. But we had to keep going and we forged ahead, while above us scudded schools of Portuguese men-of-war that let their ultramarine tentacles drift in their wakes, medusas whose milky white or dainty pink parasols were festooned with azure tassels and shaded us from the sun's rays, plus purple-striped jellyfish, which, in the dark, would have sprinkled our path with phosphorescent glimmers!"
"— Mon brave Ned, répondis-je en riant, c’étaient des perles artificielles, de simples globules de verre enduits à l’intérieur d’essence d’Orient.","""My dear Ned,"" I replied, laughing, ""they were artificial pearls, simple glass globules coated on the inside with Oriental essence.","‘My good Ned,’ I said with a laugh, ‘those were artificial pearls, mere globules of glass coated on the inside with essence of orient.’ ‘Oh, that essence of orient’, replied the Canadian, ‘must cost a great deal.’","“But,” said Conseil, “is this pearl-fishing dangerous?”","“My gallant Ned, those were imitation pearls,” I replied, laughing. “Ordinary glass beads whose insides are coated with a product called Essence of the East.” “Golly,” the Canadian replied, “that Essence of the East must go for quite a price.”"
"— La frégate ! répondit Conseil en se retournant sur le dos, je crois que monsieur fera bien de ne pas trop compter sur elle !","""The frigate!"" Conseil replied, turning on his back, ""I think Monsieur will do well not to rely too much on her!""","‘And the frigate?’ ‘The frigate,’ replied Conseil turning on his back; ‘I think monsieur would do better not to rely on it.’","“The frigate?” replied Conseil, turning on his back. “I think that master had better not count too much on her.”","“The frigate?” Conseil replied, rolling over on his back. “I think master had better not depend on it to any great extent!”"

"Le 13 janvier, le capitaine Nemo. arrivé dans la mer de Timor, avait connaissance de l’île de ce nom par 1220 de longitude.

Aussi, ces ancêtres écailleux foisonnent dans les rivières de l’île, et sont l’objet d’une vénération particulière. On les protège, on les gâte, on les adule, on les nourrit, on leur offre des jeunes filles en pâture, et malheur à l’étranger qui porte la main sur ces lézards sacrés.","On January 13, Captain Nemo. arrived in the Timor Sea, had knowledge of the island of that name by 1220 longitude.

"Mais une question, indiscrète peut-être, se posait naturellement, et je ne pus me retenir de la lui faire.","But a question, indiscreet perhaps, naturally arose, and I couldn't refrain from asking it.","But one question, perhaps indiscreet, impulsively occurred to me, and I could not resist asking it.","And if it is true that the engineer has more confidence in the vessel than the builder, and the builder than the captain himself, you understand the trust I repose in my Nautilus; for I am at once captain, builder, and engineer.”","But one question naturally popped up, and though it may have been out of line, I couldn't help asking it."

"« Que monsieur me permette de lui faire une observation, me dit alors Conseil. Ce pauvre Ned pense à tout ce qu’il ne peut pas avoir. Tout lui revient de sa vie passée. Tout lui semble regrettable de ce qui nous est interdit. Ses anciens souvenirs l’oppressent et il a le cœur gros. Il faut le comprendre. Qu’est-ce qu’il a à faire ici ? Rien. Il n’est pas un savant comme monsieur, et ne saurait prendre le même goût que nous aux choses admirables de la mer. Il risquerait tout pour pouvoir entrer dans une taverne de son pays ! »","""Let Monsieur allow me to make an observation to him,"" Conseil said to me then. Poor Ned thinks of everything he can't have. Everything comes back to him from his past life. Everything seems regrettable to him that is forbidden to us. His old memories oppress him and he has a heavy heart. You have to understand it. What's he got to do here? Nothing. He is not a scientist like Monsieur, and cannot take the same taste as us for the admirable things of the sea. He would risk everything to be able to enter a tavern in his country! »","‘If I may be allowed to make an observation,’ said Conseil, ‘poor Ned is thinking about all the things he cannot have. Everything casts him back to his former life. Everything appears jaded to him, because everything is restricted. His past memories oppress him, and he is sore at heart. We need to understand. What can he do here? Nothing. He is not a scientist like monsieur, and so is not able to take the same interest as us in the incredible things in the sea all around. He would risk everything to go to a tavern in his home country!’","“Will you allow me to make one observation, sir?” said Conseil. “Poor Ned is longing for everything that he cannot have. His past life is always present to him; everything that we are forbidden he regrets. His head is full of old recollections. And we must understand him. What has he to do here? Nothing; he is not learned like you, sir; and has not the same taste for the beauties of the sea that we have. He would risk everything to be able to go once more into a tavern in his own country.”","“With master's permission, I'll make a comment to him,” Conseil told me. “Our poor Ned broods about everything he can't have. His former life haunts him. He misses everything that's forbidden to us. He's burdened by all his old memories, and it's breaking his heart. We need to understand him. What does he have to keep him occupied? Nothing. He isn't a scientist like master, so he doesn't share our enthusiasm for the sea's wonders. He would run any risk just to go into a tavern in his own country!”"

"Or, ce second bras — c’est plutôt un collier qu’un bras — entoure de ses anneaux d’eau chaude cette portion de l’Océan froide, tranquille, immobile, que l’on appelle la mer de Sargasses.

"Sous cette mer libre, le Nautilus avait pris directement le chemin de pôle, sans s’écarter du cinquante-deuxième méridien. De 67°30’à 90° vingt-deux degrés et demi en latitude restaient à parcourir, c’est-à-dire un peu plus de cinq cents lieues.

"Cependant, sans dédaigner ces théories, l’équipage du Nautilus s’empara d’une demi-douzaine de manates. Il s’agissait, en effet, d’approvisionner les cambuses d’une chair excellente, supérieure à celle du bœuf et du veau. Cette chasse ne fut pas intéressante. Les manates se laissaient frapper sans se défendre.

Il est doué d’une prodigieuse facilité de déplacement. Or, vous le savez mieux que moi, monsieur le professeur, la nature ne fait rien à contre sens, et elle ne donnerait pas à un animal lent de sa nature la faculté de se mouvoir rapidement, s’il n’avait pas besoin de s’en servir.

"Quand je rentrai, après deux heures de travail, pour prendre quelque nourriture et quelque repos, je trouvai une notable différence entre le fluide pur que me fournissait l’appareil Rouquayrol et l’atmosphère du Nautilus, déjà chargé d’acide carbonique.

Cependant, en un laps de douze heures, nous n’avions enlevé qu’une tranche de glace épaisse d’un mètre sur la superficie dessinée, soit environ six cents mètres cubes.

However, in a span of twelve hours, we had only removed a meter-thick slice of ice from the drawn area, or about six hundred cubic meters. Admitting that the same work was accomplished by twelve hours, it would still take five nights and four days to bring this enterprise to a successful conclusion.","When I returned after two hours of work to take some food and rest, I found a notable difference between the pure air that the Rouquayrol apparatus had been giving me and the atmosphere of the Nautilus, already full of carbon dioxide. The air had not been renewed for forty-eight hours, and its life-giving qualities were considerably reduced. Also, in a period of twelve hours we had only removed a slab of ice a metre thick from the designated area , that is about 600 cubic metres. Assuming the same amount of work was executed every twelve hours, we still needed five nights and four days to finish.","When I reentered, after working two hours, to take some food and rest, I found a perceptible difference between the pure fluid with which the Rouquayrol engine supplied me, and the atmosphere of the Nautilus, already charged with carbonic acid. The air had not been renewed for forty-eight hours, and its vivifying qualities were considerably enfeebled. However, after a lapse of twelve hours, we had only raised a block of ice one yard thick, on the marked surface, which was about 600 cubic yards! Reckoning that it took twelve hours to accomplish this much, it would take five nights and four days to bring this enterprise to a satisfactory conclusion.","After two hours of work, coming back in to grab a little food and rest, I found a noticeable difference between the clean elastic fluid supplied me by the Rouquayrol device and the Nautilus's air, which was already full of carbon dioxide. Our oxygen hadn't been replenished in forty-eight hours, and its vital attributes were considerably reduced. Meanwhile, after twelve hours had gone by, we'd removed from the outlined surface area a slice of ice only a yard thick, hence about 21,000 cubic feet. Assuming we could achieve the same result every twelve hours, it would still take five nights and four days to see the undertaking through to completion."

"Les madrépores, qu’il faut se garder de confondre avec les coraux, ont un tissu revêtu d’un encroûtement calcaire, et les modifications de sa structure ont amené M. Milne-Edwards, mon illustre maître, à les classer en cinq sections. Les petits animalcules qui sécrètent ce polypier vivent par milliards au fond de leurs cellules. Ce sont leurs dépôts calcaires qui deviennent rochers, récifs, îlots, îles. Ici, ils forment un anneau circulaire, entourant un lagon ou un petit lac intérieur, que des brèches mettent en communication avec la mer. Là, ils figurent des barrières de récifs semblables à celles qui existent sur les côtes de la Nouvelle-Calédonie et de diverses îles des Pomotou. En d’autres endroits, comme à la Réunion et à Maurice, ils élèvent des récifs frangés, hautes murailles droites, près desquelles les profondeurs de l’Océan sont considérables.","Madrepores, which must not be confused with corals, have a tissue covered with a calcareous crust, and the modifications of its structure have led Mr. Milne-Edwards, my illustrious master, to classify them into five sections.

Here, they form a circular ring, surrounding a lagoon or a small interior lake, which breaches put in communication with the sea. There, they appear barriers of reefs similar to those which exist on the coasts of New Caledonia and various islands of the Pomotou. In other places, as in Reunion and Mauritius, they raise fringed reefs, high straight walls, near which the depths of the ocean are considerable.","Madrepores must not be confused with corals, for they are covered in a limestone crust; the changes in their structure led M. Milne-Edwards, my illustrious mentor, to classify them in five categories. The billions of tiny animalculae which secrete this polypary live inside their cells. The limestone they deposit creates rocks, reefs, islets, and islands. Sometimes they form a circular ring, or lagoon, round a small inland lake, with gaps communicating with the open sea. Sometimes they produce barrier reefs like those off the coasts of New Caledonia and many of the islands of the Tuamotus.

"Pendant cette navigation au milieu des glaces, le capitaine Nemo se tint souvent sur la plate-forme. Il observait avec attention ces parages abandonnés. Je voyais son calme regard s’animer parfois. Se disait-il que dans ces mers polaires interdites à l’homme, il était là chez lui, maître de ces infranchissables espaces ? Peut-être. Mais il ne parlait pas. Il restait immobile, ne revenant à lui que lorsque ses instincts de manœuvrier reprenaient le dessus. Dirigeant alors son Nautilus avec une adresse consommée, il évitait habilement le choc de ces masses dont quelques-unes mesuraient une longueur de plusieurs milles sur une hauteur qui variait de soixante-dix à quatre-vingts mètres. Souvent l’horizon paraissait entièrement fermé. A la hauteur du soixantième degré de latitude, toute passe avait disparu. Mais le capitaine Nemo, cherchant avec soin, trouvait bientôt quelque étroite ouverture par laquelle il se glissait audacieusement, sachant bien, cependant, qu’elle se refermerait derrière lui.","During this navigation in the middle of the ice, Captain Nemo often stood on the platform. He observed these abandoned parts attentively. I saw his calm gaze come alive sometimes. Did he tell himself that in these polar seas forbidden to man, he was there at home, master of these impassable spaces? Perhaps. But he didn't speak. He remained motionless, only coming to when his maneuvering instincts took over. Steering his Nautilus with consummate skill, he skilfully avoided the shock of these masses, some of which measured a length of several miles and a height which varied from seventy to eighty meters. Often the horizon seemed entirely closed. At the height of the sixtieth degree of latitude, all pass had disappeared. But Captain Nemo, searching carefully, soon found some narrow opening through which he slipped boldly, knowing well, however, that it would close behind him.","During this navigation through the ice, Captain Nemo often stayed on the platform. He carefully scanned those lonely seas. I could see his calm regard sometimes becoming more intense. Was he saying to himself that in these polar seas, forbidden to man, he was at home, master of the uncrossable spaces? Perhaps. But he did not speak. He remained motionless, only interrupting his dreaming when his instinct for action took over again. Then, steering his Nautilus with consummate skill, he would carefully avoid collision with the hulking masses, which occasionally measured several miles long by a height of between 70 and 80 metres. Often the horizon would appear entirely closed. At the 60th degree of latitude, indeed, all passes had vanished. But Captain Nemo studied the situation, and soon found some narrow opening through which he audaciously slipped, although knowing full well that it would close up again behind him.","The more we neared the south the more these floating islands increased both in number and importance. At the sixtieth degree of latitude, every pass had disappeared. But seeking carefully, Captain Nemo soon found a narrow opening, through which he boldly slipped, knowing, however, that it would close behind him.","During this navigating in the midst of the ice, Captain Nemo often stayed on the platform. He scanned those deserted waterways carefully. Sometimes I could see his calm eyes perk up. In these polar seas forbidden to man, did he feel right at home, the lord of these unreachable regions? Maybe. But he didn't say. He stood stock-still, coming to life only when his pilot's instincts took over. Then he steered his Nautilus with consummate skill, expertly dodging masses of ice that were sometimes several miles long and around 230 to 260feet high. Often they seemed to completely block off the horizon. Level with latitude 60° all passagewayshad vanished. Captain Nemo searched with care and soon found a narrow opening into which he brazenly slipped, knowing full well, however, that it would close up behind him."
"Nous marchions isolément, en véritables flâneurs, chacun s’arrêtant ou s’éloignant au gré de sa fantaisie. Pour mon compte, je n’avais plus aucun souci des dangers que mon imagination avait exagérés si ridiculement. Le haut-fond se rapprochait sensiblement de la surface de la mer, et bientôt par un mètre d’eau ma tête dépassa le niveau océanique. Conseil me rejoignit, et collant sa grosse capsule à la mienne, il me fit des yeux un salut amical. Mais ce plateau élevé ne mesurait que quelques toises, et bientôt nous fûmes rentrés dans notre élément. Je crois avoir maintenant le droit de le qualifier ainsi.","We walked in isolation, like real strollers, each stopping or moving away according to his fancy. For my part, I no longer cared about the dangers my imagination had exaggerated so ridiculously. The shoal approached noticeably the surface of the sea, and soon by a meter of water my head exceeded the ocean level. Conseil joined me, and sticking his big capsule to mine, he gave me a friendly bow with his eyes. But this high plateau only measured a few fathoms, and soon we were back in our element. I think I now have the right to call it that.","We walked separately, just like strollers, each of us stopping or wandering, following our fancy. For my part I no longer worried about the dangers that my imagination had so ridiculously exaggerated. The bottom was rising noticeably, and my head soon rose above the surface as I stood in 3 feet of water. Conseil drew near me and, sticking his large capsule close to mine, said a friendly hello with his eyes. But this high ground only lasted a few metres and soon we were back in our element. I believe I now have the right to call it that!","Each year the secretions of the mollusk would add new concentric circles. I estimated its value at £500,000 at least.","We walked by ourselves, honest-to-goodness loiterers stopping or straying as our fancies dictated. Speaking for myself, I no longer worried about those dangers my imagination had so ridiculously exaggerated. The shallows drew noticeably closer to the surface of the sea, and soon I was walking in little more than three feet of water, my head well above the level of the ocean. Conseil rejoined me, and gluing his huge brass helmet to mine, he gave me a friendly hello with his eyes. But this elevated plateau was only several yards long, and soon we reentered Our Element. I believe I'm now qualified to give it that label."

The coasts of Africa and Europe then narrowed, and in this narrow space, encounters were frequent. I saw there numerous hulls of iron, fantastic ruins of steamers, some lying down, others upright, resembling formidable animals. One of those open-sided boats, its curved funnel, its wheels of which only the mounting remained, its rudder separated from the sternpost and still held in place by an iron chain, its transom corroded by sea salts, presented itself under a terrible aspect! How many lives shattered in its shipwreck! How many victims dragged under the waves! Had any sailor on board survived to tell of this terrible disaster, or were the waves still keeping the secret of this disaster? I don't know why, it occurred to me that this boat buried under the sea could be the Atlas, disappeared body and belongings for twenty years, and which we have never heard of!

Did some sailor on board live to spin yarns about this dreadful disaster, or did the waves still keep this casualty a secret?

So the Red Sea is still not the route to take us back to Europe.’","“I need not tell you, sir,” said Ned Land, “that the Red Sea is as much closed as the gulf, as the Isthmus of Suez is not yet cut; and if it was, a boat as mysterious as ours would not risk itself in a canal cut with sluices. And again the Red Sea is not the road to take us back to Europe.”","“I don't need to tell you, sir,” Ned Land replied, “that the Red Sea is as landlocked as the gulf, since the Isthmus of Suez still isn't cut through all the way; and even if it was, a boat as secretive as ours wouldn't dare go into a canal intersected with locks. So the Red Sea won't be our route back to Europe either.”"

"Décidément le capitaine Nemo avait jugé inutile d’éveiller l’idée de requins dans l’esprit de mes compagnons. Moi, je les regardais d’un œil troublé, et comme s’il leur manquait déjà quelque membre. Devais-je les prévenir ? Oui, sans doute, mais je ne savais trop comment m’y prendre.","Decidedly Captain Nemo had deemed it useless to awaken the idea of sharks in the minds of my companions.

As for me, I was looking at them with unfocused eyes, as if they were already missing a limb or two. Should I warn them? Undoubtedly, but I didn’t know how to go about it.","“Sir,” said Conseil, “would you give us some details of the pearl-fishery?”","Clearly Captain Nemo hadn't seen fit to bring up that little matter of sharks with my companions.

"Nos recherches ne furent pas vaines, et, vers midi, nous avions fait une ample provision de bananes. Ces produits délicieux de la zone torride mûrissent pendant toute l’année, et les Malais, qui leur ont donné le nom de « pisang », les mangent sans les faire cuire. Avec ces bananes, nous recueillîmes des jaks énormes dont le goût est très accusé, des mangues savoureuses, et des ananas d’un grosseur invraisemblable. Mais cette récolte prit une grande partie de notre temps, que, d’ailleurs, il n’y avait pas lieu de regretter.","Our searches were not in vain, and towards noon we had made an ample supply of bananas. These delicious products from the torrid zone ripen throughout the year, and the Malays, who gave them the name of ""pisang"", eat them without cooking them.

These delicious products of the tropical zone ripen the whole year round, and the Malays, who call them pisang, eat them uncooked.

"Le lendemain, premier avril, lorsque le Nautilus remonta à la surface des flots, quelques minutes avant midi, nous eûmes connaissance d’une côte à l’ouest. C’était la Terre du Feu, à laquelle les premiers navigateurs donnèrent ce nom en voyant les fumées nombreuses qui s’élevaient des huttes indigènes. Cette Terre du Feu forme une vaste agglomération d’îles qui s’étend sur trente lieues de long et quatre-vingts lieues de large, entre 53° et 56° de latitude australe, et 67°50’et 77°15’de longitude ouest. La côte me parut basse, mais au loin se dressaient de hautes montagnes. Je crus même entrevoir le mont Sarmiento, élevé de deux mille soixante-dix mètres au-dessus du niveau de la mer, bloc pyramidal de schiste, à sommet très aigu, qui, suivant qu’il est voilé ou dégagé de vapeurs, « annonce le beau ou le mauvais temps », me dit Ned Land.","The next day, the first of April, when the Nautilus rose to the surface of the waves, a few minutes before noon, we became aware of a coast to the west. It was Tierra del Fuego, to which the first navigators gave this name when they saw the numerous smoke rising from the native huts. This Tierra del Fuego forms a vast agglomeration of islands which extends over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide, between 53° and 56° of southern latitude, and 67°50' and 77°15' of longitude. west. The coast seemed low to me, but in the distance rose high mountains. I even thought I caught a glimpse of Mount Sarmiento, raised two thousand and seventy meters above sea level, a pyramidal block of schist, with a very sharp summit, which, depending on whether it is veiled or cleared of vapours, ""announces rain or shine,” Ned Land tells me.","The following day, 1 April, when the Nautilus surfaced a few minutes before noon, we sighted a coast to the west. This was Tierra del Fuego, so called by the first navigators because they saw large amounts of smoke rising from the native huts. Tierra del Fuego forms a vast collection of islands more than 80 leagues in length by 30 leagues in width, between 53° and 56 ° S and 67 ° 50´ and 77 ° 14´ W. The coast seemed low, but high mountains rose in the distance. I even thought I glimpsed Mount Sarmiento, 2,070 metres above sea level. This is a block of schist in the shape of a pyramid with a very sharp summit, and whether it is covered in mists or is free of vapour ‘forecasts good or bad weather’, as Ned Land told me.","The next day, April 1, when the Nautilus ascended to the surface, some minutes before noon, we sighted land to the west. It was Terra del Fuego, which the first navigators named thus from seeing the quantity of smoke that rose from the natives’ huts. The coast seemed low to me, but in the distance rose high mountains. I even thought I had a glimpse of Mount Sarmiento, that rises 2,070 yards above the level of the sea, with a very pointed summit, which, according as it is misty or clear, is a sign of fine or of wet weather.","The next day, April 1, when the Nautilus rose to the surface of the waves a few minutes before noon, we raised land to the west. It was Tierra del Fuego, which means “Land of Fire,” a name given it by early navigators when they saw many curls of smoke rising from the natives’ huts. This Land of Fire forms a huge cluster of islands 75 miles long and 200 miles wide, stretching between latitude 53° and 56° south, and between longitude 67° 50' and 77° 15' west. Its coastline looked flat, but lofty mountains rose in the distance. I even thought I glimpsed Mt. Sarmiento, whose elevation is 6,791 feet above sea level—a pyramid-shaped hunk of shale with a very sharp peak, which, depending on whether it's clear or clouded over, “predicts fair weather or foul,” as Ned Land told me."

"Nous avions quitté le Nautilus depuis une heure et demie environ. Il était près de midi. Je m’en aperçus à la perpendicularité des rayons solaires qui ne se réfractaient plus.

Nous marchions d’un pas régulier qui résonnait sur le sol avec une intensité étonnante. Les moindres bruits se transmettaient avec une vitesse à laquelle l’oreille n’est pas habituée sur la terre. En effet, l’eau est pour le son un meilleur véhicule que l’air, et il s’y propage avec une rapidité quadruple.","We had left the Nautilus for about an hour and a half. It was nearly noon.

Le commandant Bouguer s’approcha de l’animal, et il l’attaqua à coups de harpon et à coups de fusil, sans grand succès, car balles et harpons traversaient ces chairs molles comme une gelée sans consistance.

Commander Bouguer closed in and attacked the creature, hurling harpoons and firing rifles at it, but without much success because both bullets and harpoons skidded across its soft flesh as if it were semiliquid jelly. After several fruitless attempts the crew managed to slip a noose around the mollusk's body. This noose slid as far as the caudal finsand came to a halt. Then they tried to haul the monster on board, but when they tugged on the rope, the creaturewas so heavy that it parted company with its tail, and deprived of that adornment, it vanished beneath the waves.”"

"Là existent deux courants : un courant supérieur, depuis longtemps reconnu, qui amène les eaux de l’Océan dans le bassin de la Méditerranée ; puis un contre-courant inférieur, dont le raisonnement a démontré aujourd’hui l’existence. En effet, la somme des eaux de la Méditerranée, incessamment accrue par les flots de l’Atlantique et par les fleuves qui s’y jettent, devrait élever chaque année le niveau de cette mer, car son évaporation est insuffisante pour rétablir l’équilibre. Or, il n’en est pas ainsi, et on a dû naturellement admettre l’existence d’un courant inférieur qui par le détroit de Gibraltar verse dans le bassin de l’Atlantique le trop-plein de la Méditerranée.","There exist two currents: an upper current, long recognized, which brings the waters of the ocean into the basin of the Mediterranean; then a lower counter-current, the existence of which has now been demonstrated by reasoning. Indeed, the sum of the waters of the Mediterranean, incessantly increased by the waves of the Atlantic and by the rivers which flow into it, should raise the level of this sea each year, because its evaporation is insufficient to restore the balance. . However, this is not so, and we naturally had to admit the existence of an inferior current which, through the Strait of Gibraltar, pours into the Atlantic basin the overflow of the Mediterranean.","There are two currents here: an upper current, known for a long time, which brings the waters from the ocean into the Mediterranean basin; and a lower counter-current, whose existence has been demonstrated by hypothesis. The sum of the waters of the Mediterranean, constantly increased by the current from the Atlantic and the rivers flowing into it, should raise its level each year, for the rate of evaporation is insufficient to re-establish equilibrium. But nothing of the sort occurs, and so the existence has had to be posited of a lower current pouring the surplus through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Atlantic basin.","There once existed two currents—an upper one, long since recognized, which conveys the waters of the ocean into the basin of the Mediterranean; and a lower counter-current, which reasoning has now shown to exist. Indeed, the volume of water in the Mediterranean, incessantly added to by the waves of the Atlantic, and by rivers falling into it, would each year raise the level of this sea, for its evaporation is not sufficient to restore the equilibrium. As it is not so, we must necessarily admit the existence of an under-current, which empties into the basin of the Atlantic, through the Straits of Gibraltar, the surplus waters of the Mediterranean.","There are two currents here: an upper current, long known to exist, that carries the Atlantic Ocean's waters into the Mediterranean basin; then a lower countercurrent, whose existence has been proven more recently by simple logic. In essence the Mediterranean receives a continual influx of water both from rivers emptying into it and from the Atlantic; since its rate of evaporation isn't enough to restore the balance, the total amount of additional water should raise the Mediterranean's level every year. Yet that isn't the case, so we're naturally led to assume the existence of some lower current that carries the Mediterranean's surplus back through the Strait of Gibraltar and into the Atlantic basin."

"En effet, j’étais déjà réduit à multiplier mes inspirations pour extraire de cette cellule le peu d’oxygène qu’elle renfermait, quand, soudain, je fus rafraîchi par un courant d’air pur et tout parfumé d’émanations salines.

"Pendant que j’observais cet être phénoménal, deux jets de vapeur et d’eau s’élancèrent de ses évents, et montèrent à une hauteur de quarante mètres, ce qui me fixa sur son mode de respiration. J’en conclus définitivement qu’il appartenait à l’embranchement des vertébrés, classe des mammifères, sous-classe des monodelphiens, groupe des pisciformes, ordre des cétacés, famille… Ici, je ne pouvais encore me prononcer. L’ordre des cétacés comprend trois familles : les baleines, les cachalots et les dauphins, et c’est dans cette dernière que sont rangés les narwals. Chacune de ces famille se divise en plusieurs genres, chaque genre en espèces, chaque espèce en variétés. Variété, espèce, genre et famille me manquaient encore, mais je ne doutais pas de compléter ma classification avec l’aide du ciel et du commandant Farragut.","As I watched this phenomenal being, two jets of steam and water sprang from its vents, and rose to a height of forty meters, which fixed me on its mode of breathing. I definitively concluded that it belonged to the phylum of vertebrates, class of mammals, subclass of monodelphians, group of pisciforms, order of cetaceans, family… Here, I could not yet decide. The order of cetaceans includes three families: whales, sperm whales and dolphins, and it is in the latter that the narwhals are placed. Each of these families is divided into several genera, each genus into species, each species into varieties. I still missed variety, species, genus and family, but I had no doubt that I would complete my classification with the help of heaven and Commander Farragut.","While I was examining the phenomenal creature, two jets of water and vapour spurted from its blowholes and rose to a height of 120 feet — thus settling its method of respiration. I concluded once and for all that the animal belonged to the vertebrates, class of mammals, sub-class of monodelphians, group of pisciforms, order of cetaceans, family — but here I was unable to make up my mind. The order of Cetaceae comprises three families, whales, cachalots, and dolphins, with narwhals classified in the last category. Each family is in turn divided into several genera, each genus into species, and each species into varieties. I did not yet know the creature’s variety, species, genus, or family, but I felt confident about being able to complete my classification with the help of Heaven and Captain Farragut.","While I watched this phenomenon, two jets of steam and water were ejected from its vents, and rose to the height of 120 feet; thus I ascertained its way of breathing.

So I concluded once and for all that it belonged to the branch Vertebrata, class Mammalia, subclass Monodelphia, group Pisciforma, order Cetacea, family … but here I couldn't make up my mind. The order Cetacea consists of three families, baleen whales, sperm whales, and dolphins, and it's in this last group that narwhals are placed.

"Mais bientôt les buissons se resserrèrent, les arborisations grandirent. De véritables taillis pétrifiés et de longues travées d’une architecture fantaisiste s’ouvrirent devant nos pas. Le capitaine Nemo s’engagea sous une obscure galerie dont la pente douce nous conduisit à une profondeur de cent mètres. La lumière de nos serpentins produisait parfois des effets magiques, en s’accrochant aux rugueuses aspérités de ces arceaux naturels et aux pendentifs disposés comme des lustres, qu’elle piquait de pointes de feu. Entre les arbrisseaux coralliens, j’observai d’autres polypes non moins curieux, des mélites, des iris aux ramifications articulées, puis quelques touffes de corallines, les unes vertes, les autres rouges, véritables algues encroûtées dans leurs sels calcaires, que les naturalistes, après longues discussions, ont définitivement rangées dans le règne végétal. Mais, suivant la remarque d’un penseur, « c’est peut-être là le point réel où la vie obscurément se soulève du sommeil de pierre, sans se détacher encore de ce rude point de départ ».","But soon the bushes tightened, the arborizations grew. Veritable petrified thickets and long spans of fanciful architecture opened up before our steps. Captain Nemo entered under a dark gallery, the gentle slope of which led us to a depth of a hundred meters. The light from our streamers sometimes produced magical effects, clinging to the rough asperities of these natural arches and to the pendants arranged like chandeliers, which it pricked with points of fire. Between the coral shrubs, I observed other polyps no less curious, melites, irises with articulated ramifications, then a few tufts of corallines, some green, others red, veritable algae encrusted in their calcareous salts, which the naturalists , after long discussions, have definitely been placed in the vegetable kingdom. But, according to the remark of a thinker, ""this is perhaps the real point where life obscurely rises from the stony sleep, without yet detaching itself from this rough starting point"".","But soon the bushes grew smaller and the arborescences larger. True petrified woods and the long aisles of a fantastic architecture opened before our feet. Captain Nemo headed into a dark gallery, whose gentle slope led us to a depth of 100 metres.

But as one thinker has remarked,* ‘Perhaps this is the real point where life dimly rises from a sleep of stone, without yet cutting itself off from that rude starting-point.’","But soon the bushes contract, and the arborizations increase. Real petrified thickets, long joists of fantastic architecture, were disclosed before us. Captain Nemo placed himself under a dark gallery, where by a slight declivity we reached a depth of 100 yards. The light from our lamps produced sometimes magical effects, following the rough outlines of the natural arches, and pendants disposed like lusters, that were tipped with points of fire. Between the coralline shrubs I noticed other polypi not less curious—melites, and irises with articulated ramifications; also some tufts of coral, some green, others red, like seaweed incrusted in their calcareous salts, that naturalists, after long discussion, have definitely classed in the vegetable kingdom. But following the remark of a thinking man, “there is perhaps the real point where life rises obscurely from the sleep of a stone, without detaching itself from the rough point of departure.”","But as the bushes shrank, the tree forms magnified. Actual petrified thickets and long alcoves from some freakish school of architecture kept opening up in front of us. Captain Nemo went down a dark hallway whose gentle slope took us to a depth of over 300 feet. The light from our glass spirals created magical effects at times, lingering on the wrinkled roughness of some natural arch or some overhang suspended like a chandelier, which our lamps would fleck with fiery sparks. Among these bushes of precious coral, I saw other polyps just as unusual—red coral, iris coral with jointed outgrowths, and then a few tufts of genus Corallina, some green and others red, actually a type of seaweed encrusted with limestone salts, which, after years of arguing, naturalists have finally assigned to the vegetable kingdom. Yet as one intellectual has commented, “This could be the actual point where life rises humbly out of sleeping stone, but without completely breaking away from its primitive starting point.”"

En effet, si je représente par un la densité de l’eau douce, je trouve un vingt-huit millième pour les eaux de l’Atlantique, un vingt-six millième pour les eaux du Pacifique, un trente-millième pour les eaux de la Méditerranée…","“You know, Professor, that sea water is denser than fresh water, but this density is not uniform.

"Pendant que nous effleurions les fonds du banc de Terre-Neuve, je vis parfaitement ces longues lignes, armées de deux cents hameçons, que chaque bateau tend par douzaines. Chaque ligne entraînée par un bout au moyen d’un petit grappin, était retenue a la surface par un orin fixé sur une bouée de liège. Le Nautilus dut manœuvrer adroitement au milieu de ce réseau sous-marin.","As we skimmed the bottom of the Newfoundland Bank, I saw clearly those long lines, armed with two hundred hooks, which each boat sets by the dozens. Each line dragged by a line by means of a small grapple, was retained on the surface by a rope fixed on a cork buoy. The Nautilus had to maneuver adroitly in the middle of this submarine network.","While we were skimming over the bottom of the Bank of Newfoundland, I could easily see the hundreds of long lines, each with two hundred hooks, deployed by each boat. The lines, dragged along using small clips, were stopped from sinking by cross-hatched cords fixed to cork buoys. The Nautilus had to manoeuvre carefully through this submarine network.","But I undeceived the worthy fellow, and by way of consolation related several particulars in the laying of this cable.","As we skimmed the depths of the Grand Banks, I could clearly see those long fishing lines—each equipped with 200 hooks—that every boat dangled by the dozens. The lower end of each line dragged the bottom with the help of a small grappling hook, and at the surface it was secured to the buoy-rope of a cork float. The Nautilus had to maneuver shrewdly in the midst of this underwater spiderweb."
"La végétation de ce continent désolé me parut extrêmement restreinte. Quelques lichens de l’espèce Unsnea melanoxantha s’étalaient sur les roches noires. Certaines plantules microscopiques, des diatomées rudimentaires, sortes de cellules disposées entre deux coquilles quartzeuses, de longs fucus pourpres et cramoisis, supportés sur de petites vessies natatoires et que le ressac jetait à la côte, composaient toute la maigre flore de cette région.","The vegetation of this desolate continent seemed to me extremely restricted.

"Malgré les bourdonnements qui emplissaient ma tête, j’entendis bientôt des frémissements sous la coque du Nautilus. Un dénivellement se produisit.

"Nous étions enfin sur le théâtre des derniers ébats du monstre ! Et, pour tout dire, on ne vivait plus à bord.

"Tout en avançant, j’entendais une sorte de grésillement au-dessus de ma tête. Ce bruit redoublait parfois et produisait comme un pétillement continu. J’en compris bientôt la cause. C’était la pluie qui tombait violemment en crépitant à la surface des flots. Instinctivement, la pensée me vint que j’allais être trempé ! Par l’eau, au milieu de l’eau ! Je ne pus m’empêcher de rire à cette idée baroque. Mais pour tout dire, sous l’épais habit du scaphandre, on ne sent plus le liquide élément, et l’on se croit au milieu d’une atmosphère un peu plus dense que l’atmosphère terrestre, voilà tout.","As I moved forward, I heard a kind of crackling above my head. This noise increased at times and produced a sort of continuous crackling. I soon understood the cause. It was the rain falling violently, pattering on the surface of the waves. Instinctively, the thought came to me that I was going to get soaked! Through the water, in the middle of the water! I couldn't help laughing at this bizarre idea. But to tell the truth, under the thick coat of the diving suit, one no longer feels the liquid element, and one believes oneself in the middle of an atmosphere a little denser than the terrestrial atmosphere, that is all.","While walking, I heard a sort of sizzling sound above my head. The noise sometimes got much louder and became a continuous crackling. I soon understood the reason. It was rain, pattering violently down on the surface. Instinctively the thought came to me that I was going to get wet! Being rained on underwater: I couldn’t help laughing at the strange idea! But to tell the truth, in the thick clothing of the diving suit I no longer had any sensation of being underwater, merely of being in an atmosphere slightly denser than on land.","As we advanced, I heard a kind of pattering above my head. The noise redoubling, sometimes producing a continual shower, I soon understood the cause. It was rain falling violently, and crisping the surface of the waves. Instinctively the thought flashed across my mind that I should be wet through! By the water! In the midst of the water! I could not help laughing at the odd idea. But indeed, in the thick diving-dress, the liquid element is no longer felt, and one only seems to be in an atmosphere somewhat denser than the terrestrial atmosphere. Nothing more.","As we moved forward I heard a sort of pitter-patter overhead. Sometimes this sound speeded up and turned into a continual crackling. I soon figured out the cause. It was a heavy rainfall rattling on the surface of the waves. Instinctively I worried that I would get soaked. By water in the midst of water! I couldn't help chuckling at this outlandish notion. But to tell the truth, in these heavy diving suits you no longer feel the liquid element—you simply think you're in the midst of air a little denser than air on land."
"— Détestable, ami Ned, répondit Conseil ; mais un petit verre de vinaigre qui coûte quinze cents mille francs, c’est d’un joli prix.","""Detestable, friend Ned,"" replied Conseil; but a small glass of vinegar which costs fifteen hundred thousand francs is a handsome price.","‘Awful, Ned, my friend,’ replied Conseil ; ‘but at one-and-a-half million francs, a small glass of vinegar is highly priced.’","“But,” said Conseil, “is this pearl-fishing dangerous?”","“Abominable, Ned my friend,” Conseil replied. “But when a little glass of vinegar is worth $300,000, its taste is a small price to pay.”"

"Pendant une heure environ. Le Nautilus flotta au milieu de cette troupe de mollusques. Puis, je ne sais quel effroi les prit soudain.

"Le 25 janvier, l’Océan étant absolument désert, le Nautilus passa la journée à sa surface, battant les flots de sa puissante hélice et les faisant rejaillir à une grande hauteur. Comment, dans ces conditions, ne l’eût-on pas pris pour un cétacé gigantesque ? Je passai les trois quarts de cette journée sur la plate-forme. Je regardais la mer. Rien à l’horizon, si ce n’est, vers quatre heures du soir, un long steamer qui courait dans l’ouest à contrebord. Sa mâture fut visible un instant, mais il ne pouvait apercevoir le Nautilus, trop ras sur l’eau.

Nothing on the horizon, except, about four o'clock in the evening, a long steamer running west on the opposite side.

Nothing in view except, westerly at about 4 p.m., a long steamer, heading on the opposite tack.

"Cette rencontre me fit penser que d’autres animaux, plus redoutables, devaient hanter ces fonds obscurs, et que mon scaphandre ne me protégerait pas contre leurs attaques. Je n’y avais pas songé jusqu’alors, et je résolus de me tenir sur mes gardes. Je supposais, d’ailleurs, que cette halte marquait le terme de notre promenade ; mais je me trompais, et, au lieu de retourner au Nautilus, le capitaine Nemo continua son audacieuse excursion.","This encounter made me think that other animals, more formidable, must haunt these dark depths, and that my diving suit would not protect me against their attacks.

Indeed, I thought that this halt would mark the termination of our walk; but I was mistaken, for, instead of returning to the Nautilus, Captain Nemo continued his bold excursion.","This confrontation reminded me that other, more alarming creatures had to be lurking in these dark reaches, and my diving suit might not be adequate protection against their attacks. Thoughts such as these hadn't previously crossed my mind, and I was now determined to keep on my guard. Meanwhile I'd figured this rest period would be the turning point in our stroll, but I was wrong; instead of heading back to the Nautilus, Captain Nemo continued his daring excursion."

— Remontons ! répondis-je.,- Let's go back! I answered.,"‘Let’s go up then,’ I replied.",“Go up again!” I exclaimed.,“Let's go back up!” I replied.
"J’étais décidé à tout. Le Canadien me quitta. Je gagnai la plate-forme, sur laquelle je pouvais à peine me maintenir contre le choc des lames.

"Plus nous descendions au sud, plus ces îles flottantes gagnaient en nombre et en importance. Les oiseaux polaires y nichaient par milliers. C’étaient des pétrels, des damiers, des puffins, qui nous assourdissaient de leurs cris.

"Je compris que pour Ned Land comme pour tous les navigateurs qui nous avaient précédé, c’était l’infranchissable obstacle. Le soleil ayant un instant paru vers midi, le capitaine Nemo obtint une observation assez exacte qui donnait notre situation par 51°30’de longitude et 67°39’de latitude méridionale. C’était déjà un point avancé des régions antarctiques.","I understood that for Ned Land as for all the navigators who had preceded us, it was the insurmountable obstacle.

It was already an advanced point of the Antarctic regions.","I understood that for Ned, like all the navigators who had preceded us, this was an insuperable obstacle.

"Nous étions haletants. La stupéfaction, bien plus que la crainte nous tenait muets et immobiles. L’animal nous gagnait en se jouant. Il fit le tour de la frégate qui filait alors quatorze nœuds. et l’enveloppa de ses nappes électriques comme d’une poussière lumineuse. Puis il s’éloigna de deux ou trois milles, laissant une traînée phosphorescente comparable aux tourbillons de vapeur que jette en arrière la locomotive d’un express. Tout d’un coup. des obscures limites de l’horizon, où il alla prendre son élan, le monstre fonça subitement vers l’Abraham-Lincoln avec une effrayante rapidité, s’arrêta brusquement à vingt pieds de ses précintes, s’éteignit non pas en s’abîmant sous les eaux, puisque son éclat ne subit aucune dégradation mais soudainement et comme si la source de ce brillant effluve se fût subitement tarie ! Puis, il reparut de l’autre côté du navire, soit qu’il l’eût tourné, soit qu’il eût glissé sous sa coque. A chaque instant une collision pouvait se produire, qui nous eût été fatale.","We were panting. Amazement, much more than fear, kept us dumb and motionless. The animal won us over by playing. He circled the frigate, which was then spinning fourteen knots. and enveloped it in its electric layers as in luminous dust. Then it moved away two or three miles, leaving a phosphorescent trail comparable to the whirlwinds of steam thrown behind the locomotive of an express. All of a sudden. dark limits of the horizon, where it went to take its momentum, the monster suddenly rushed towards the Abraham-Lincoln with frightening rapidity, stopped suddenly at twenty feet from its precincts, died out not by sinking under water, since its brilliance does not undergo any degradation but suddenly and as if the source of this brilliant effluvium had suddenly dried up! Then he reappeared on the other side of the ship, whether he had turned it or slipped under its hull. At any moment a collision could occur which would have been fatal to us.","We could hardly breathe. Astonishment rather than fear kept us silent as if transfixed. The animal caught up with us with the greatest of ease. It swam round the frigate, which was making 14 knots, and bathed us in its electric beams like luminous dust. It then moved two or three miles off, leaving a phosphorescent trail, like the spirals of steam behind the locomotive of an express train. All of a sudden, from the dark limits of the horizon, the monster accelerated and rushed at the Abraham Lincoln at frightening speed, then stopped abruptly only 20 feet from the frigate’s wales and extinguished its light — not by plunging beneath the surface, since the brilliance did not disappear gradually — but suddenly, as if the source of the brilliant discharge had instantly dried up! It then appeared on the other side, meaning it had either gone round or underneath. At every moment a collision seemed imminent: one which could easily be fatal to us.","We gasped for breath. Stupefaction more than fear made us dumb and motionless. The animal gained on us, sporting with the waves. It made the round of the frigate, which was then making fourteen knots, and enveloped it with its electric rings like luminous dust. Then it moved away two or three miles, leaving a phosphorescent track, like those volumes of steam that the express trains leave behind. All at once from the dark line of the horizon whither it retiredto gain its momentum, the monster rushed suddenly toward the Abraham Lincoln with alarming rapidity, stopped suddenly about twenty feet from the hull, and died out—not diving under the water, for its brilliancy did not abate—but suddenly, and as if the source of this brilliant emanation was exhausted. Then it reappeared on the other side of the vessel, as if it had turned and slid under the hull. Any moment a collision might have occurred which would have been fatal to us.","We gasped. More astonished than afraid, we stood hushed and motionless. The animal easily caught up with us. It circled the frigate—then doing sixteen miles per hour—and wrapped us in sheets of electricity that looked like luminous dust. Then it retreated two or three miles, leaving a phosphorescent trail like the swirls of steam that shoot behind the locomotive of an express train. Suddenly, all the way from the dark horizon where it had gone to gather momentum, the monster dashed abruptly toward the Abraham Lincoln at a frightening speed, stopped sharply twenty feet from our side plates, and quenched its light—not by diving under the waves, since its glow didn't recede gradually, but all at once, as if the source of that brilliant outpouring had suddenly been shut off. Then it reappeared on the other side of the ship, either by circling us or by gliding under our hull. Any second a collision could have occurred that would have been fatal to us."

"Ici commence la seconde partie de ce voyage sous les mers. La première s’est terminée sur cette émouvante scène du cimetière de corail qui a laissé dans mon esprit une impression profonde. Ainsi donc, au sein de cette mer immense, la vie du capitaine Nemo se déroulait tout entière, et il n’était pas jusqu’à sa tombe qu’il n’eût préparée dans le plus impénétrable de ses abîmes.

"— Ce n’est pas une raison, répondis-je. Les bras et la queue de ces animaux se reforment par rédintégration, et depuis sept ans, la queue du calmar de Bouguer a sans doute eu le temps de repousser.","""That's no reason,"" I replied.

"La lumière produisait mille effets charmants en se jouant au milieu de ces ramures si vivement colorées. Il me semblait voir ces tubes membraneux et cylindriques trembler sous l’ondulation des eaux.

Mais, si ma main s’approchait de ces fleurs vivantes, de ces sensitives animées, aussitôt l’alerte se mettait dans la colonie.

"— Je ne sais s’ils la trouveront, répondit froidement le capitaine Nemo. Quoi qu’il en soit, vous connaissez déjà la première application que j’ai faite de ce précieux agent. C’est lui qui nous éclaire avec une égalité, une continuité que n’a pas la lumière du soleil. Maintenant, regardez cette horloge ; elle est électrique, et marche avec une régularité qui défie celle des meilleurs chronomètres. Je l’ai divisée en vingt-quatre heures, comme les horloges italiennes, car pour moi, il n’existe ni nuit, ni jour, ni soleil, ni lune, mais seulement cette lumière factice que j’entraîne jusqu’au fond des mers ! Voyez, en ce moment, il est dix heures du matin.","""I don't know if they'll find her,"" answered Captain Nemo coldly. Be that as it may, you already know the first application I made of this precious agent. It is he who enlightens us with an equality, a continuity that the light of the sun does not have. Now look at this clock; it is electric, and runs with a regularity that defies that of the best chronometers. I divided it into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, because for me there is neither night nor day, neither sun nor moon, but only this artificial light that I drag down to the bottom of the seas! See, now it's ten o'clock in the morning.","‘I do not know whether they will,’ replied Captain Nemo rather coldly. ‘But in any case, you are already familiar with the first application I have made of such an invaluable tool. It is this agent which gives us light more constantly than the sun could. Look at this clock: it is electric, and keeps time more accurately than the best chronometers. I have divided it into twenty-four hours, like Italian clocks, since for me there is neither night nor day, sun nor moon, but only the artificial light I take with me to the bottom of the seas. Look, it is now ten in the morning.’","However, if electricity does not furnish me with air to breathe, it works at least the powerful pumps that are stored in spacious reservoirs, and which enable me to prolong at need, and as long as I will, my stay in the depths of the sea. It gives a uniform and unintermittent light, which the sun does not. Now look at this clock; it is electrical, and goes with a regularity that defies the best chronometers.

Look! just now, it is ten o’clock in the morning.”","“I'm not so sure they'll find it,” Captain Nemo replied icily. “Be that as it may, you're already familiar with the first use I've discovered for this valuable force. It lights us, and with a uniformity and continuity not offered even by sunlight. Now look at this clock: it's electric, it runs with an accuracy challenging the finest chronometers.

"Mais tout en observant ces divers échantillons de la faune marine, je ne laissais pas d’examiner les longues plaines de l’Atlantide. Parfois, de capricieux accidents du sol obligeaient le Nautilus à ralentir sa vitesse, et il se glissait alors avec l’adresse d’un cétacé dans d’étroits étranglements de collines. Si ce labyrinthe devenait inextricable, l’appareil s’élevait alors comme un aérostat, et l’obstacle franchi, il reprenait sa course rapide à quelques mètres au-dessus du fond. Admirable et charmante navigation, qui rappelait les manœuvres d’une promenade aérostatique, avec cette différence toutefois que le Nautilus obéissait passivement à la main de son timonier.","But while observing these various samples of marine fauna, I did not fail to examine the long plains of Atlantis. Sometimes capricious bumps in the ground compelled the Nautilus to slacken its speed, and then it glided with the dexterity of a cetacean through narrow constrictions of hills. If this labyrinth became inextricable, the apparatus then rose like an aerostat, and the obstacle cleared, it resumed its rapid course a few meters above the bottom. Admirable and charming navigation, reminiscent of the maneuvers of an aerostatic promenade, with this difference, however, that the Nautilus passively obeyed the hand of its helmsman.","But while observing the diverse specimens of the marine fauna, I continued to examine the wide plains of Atlantis. Sometimes capricious changes in the ground forced the Nautilus to slow down, and it slid with the skill of a cetacean through the narrow bottlenecks of the hills. If the labyrinth became inextricable, then the machine would rise like a balloon, go over the obstacle, and continue its swift progress a few metres above the seabed. A memorable and engrossing journey recalling the manoeuvres of an aerostatic flight, with the difference being that the Nautilus entirely obeyed its pilot’s hand.","Among bony fish Conseil noticed some blackish makairas about three yards long, armed at the upper jaw with a piercing sword; other bright-colored creatures, known in the time of Aristotlebs by the name of the sea-dragon, which are dangerous to capture on account of the spikes on their back; also some coryphænes with brown backs marked with little blue stripes and surrounded with a gold border; some beautiful dorades, and swordfish four-and-twenty feet long, swimming in troops, fierce animals, but rather herbivorous than carnivorous.","But while studying these different specimens of marine fauna, I still kept a close eye on the long plains of Atlantis. At times some unpredictable irregularity in the seafloor would oblige the Nautilus to go slower, and then it would glide into the narrow channels between the hills with a cetacean's agility. If the labyrinth became hopelessly tangled, the submersible rose above it like an airship; then, after going past the obstacle, it resumed its speedy course a few yards above the ocean floor. It was an enjoyable and impressive way of navigating that did indeed recall the maneuvers of an airship ride, with the major difference that the Nautilus faithfully obeyed the hands of its helmsman."
— A Saint-Malo ? repartit imperturbablement Conseil.,"""In Saint-Malo?"" retorted Conseil imperturbably.","‘At Saint-Malo,’ Conseil replied imperturbably.","“At St. Malo,” answered Conseil.","“In Saint-Malo,” Conseil answered unflappably."

"A neuf heures, nous accostions la terre. Le ciel s’éclaircissait. Les nuages fuyaient dans le sud. Les brumes abandonnaient la surface froide des eaux. Le capitaine Nemo se dirigea vers le pic dont il voulait sans doute faire son observatoire. Ce fut une ascension pénible sur des laves aiguës et des pierres ponces, au milieu d’une atmosphère souvent saturée par les émanations sulfureuses des fumerolles. Le capitaine, pour un homme déshabitué de fouler la terre, gravissait les pentes les plus raides avec une souplesse, une agilité que je ne pouvais égaler, et qu’eût enviée un chasseur d’isards.","At nine o'clock we landed. The sky was clearing up. Clouds were fleeing south. The mists left the cold surface of the waters. Captain Nemo headed for the peak which he no doubt wanted to make his observatory. It was a painful ascent on sharp lavas and pumice stones, in the middle of an atmosphere often saturated by the sulphurous emanations of the fumaroles. The captain, for a man unaccustomed to treading the earth, climbed the steepest slopes with a flexibility, an agility that I could not match, and that a chamois hunter would have envied.","We reached land at nine o’clock. The sky was brightening as the clouds fled southwards. * Mists rose from the cold surface of the water. Captain Nemo headed for the peak, which he undoubtedly intended to be his observatory.

For a man unaccustomed to walk on land, the captain climbed the steep slopes with an agility I never saw equaled, and which a hunter would have envied.","By nine o'clock we'd pulled up to shore. The sky was growing brighter. Clouds were escaping to the south. The fog was lifting off the cold surface of the water.

Les pompes du Nautilus ont une force prodigieuse, et vous avez dû le voir, quand leurs colonnes d’eau se sont précipitées comme un torrent sur l’Abraham-Lincoln. D’ailleurs, je ne me sers des réservoirs supplémentaires que pour atteindre des profondeurs moyennes de quinze cent à deux mille mètres, et cela dans le but de ménager mes appareils.

J’admirai son aspect étrange, au milieu des noirs rochers qui l’entourent et sur lesquels se détachent en blanc ses maisons et ses forts. J’aperçus le dôme arrondi de ses mosquées, la pointe élégante de ses minarets, ses fraîches et verdoyantes terrasses. Mais ce ne fut qu’une vision, et le Nautilus s’enfonça bientôt sous les flots sombres de ces parages.","Leaving this sea, we had a brief knowledge of Muscat, the most important city in the country of Oman.

But it was only a vision, and the Nautilus soon sank under the dark waves of these parts.","As we left this sea, we briefly sighted Muscat, the largest town in Oman.

"— Oui, monsieur le professeur, répondit avec une véritable émotion le capitaine Nemo, et je l’aime comme la chair de ma chair ! Si tout est danger sur un de vos navires soumis aux hasards de l’Océan, si sur cette mer, la première impression est le sentiment de l’abîme, comme l’a si bien dit le Hollandais Jansen, au-dessous et à bord du Nautilus, le cœur de l’homme n’a plus rien à redouter. Pas de déformation à craindre, car la double coque de ce bateau a la rigidité du fer ; pas de gréement que le roulis ou le tangage fatiguent ; pas de voiles que le vent emporte ; pas de chaudières que la vapeur déchire ; pas d’incendie à redouter, puisque cet appareil est fait de tôle et non de bois ; pas de charbon qui s’épuise, puisque l’électricité est son agent mécanique ; pas de rencontre à redouter, puisqu’il est seul à naviguer dans les eaux profondes ; pas de tempête à braver, puisqu’il trouve à quelques mètres au-dessous des eaux l’absolue tranquillité ! Voilà, monsieur. Voilà le navire par excellence ! Et s’il est vrai que l’ingénieur ait plus de confiance dans le bâtiment que le constructeur, et le constructeur plus que le capitaine lui-même, comprenez donc avec quel abandon je me fie à mon Nautilus, puisque j’en suis tout à la fois le capitaine, le constructeur et l’ingénieur ! »","""Yes, professor,"" replied Captain Nemo with real emotion, ""and I love him like the flesh of my flesh!"" If all is danger on one of your ships subjected to the hazards of the ocean, if on this sea, the first impression is the feeling of the abyss, as the Dutchman Jansen so aptly put it, below and on board of the Nautilus, the heart of man has nothing more to fear. No deformation to fear, because the double hull of this boat has the rigidity of iron; no rig that roll or pitch fatigues; no sails carried away by the wind; no boilers torn apart by steam; no fire to fear, since this device is made of sheet metal and not wood; no coal which runs out, since electricity is its mechanical agent; no encounter to fear, since he is alone in navigating the deep waters; no storm to brave, since he finds absolute tranquility a few meters below the water! Here Mr. This is the ship par excellence! And if it is true that the engineer has more confidence in the building than the builder, and the builder more than the captain himself, then understand with what abandon I trust my Nautilus, since I am completely at the same time the captain, the builder and the engineer! »","‘Yes, sir,’ responded Captain Nemo with genuine emotion, ‘ and I love it like the flesh of my flesh! * Now everything seems dangerous for one of your ships subject to the hazards of the ocean, for the first impression when on the sea is that of feeling the abyss below one, as the Dutchman Jansen* so well put it. But on board the submerged Nautilus, people can set their heart at ease.

Yes, it is the ultimate ship! And if the engineer has more confidence in his ship than its builder, and the builder more than the captain, you can understand with what entire confidence I entrusted myself to the Nautilus, since I am at one and the same time the captain, the builder, and the engineer!’","“Yes, professor; and I love it as if it were part of myself. If danger threatens one of your vessels on the ocean, the first impression is the feeling of an abyss above and below. On the Nautilus, men’s hearts never fail them. No defects to be afraid of, for the double shell is as firm as iron; no rigging to attend to; no sails for the wind to carry away; no boilers to burst; no fire to fear, for the vessel is made of iron, not of wood; no coal to run short, for electricity is the only mechanical agent; no collision to fear, for it alone swims in deep water; no tempest to brave, for when it dives below the water, it reaches absolute tranquillity. There, sir! that is the perfection of vessels! And if it is true that the engineer has more confidence in the vessel than the builder, and the builder than the captain himself, you understand the trust I repose in my Nautilus; for I am at once captain, builder, and engineer.”","“Yes, professor,” Captain Nemo replied with genuine feeling, “and I love it like my own flesh and blood!

There are no structural weaknesses to fear, because our double hull has the rigidity of iron; no rigging strained by rolling and pitching on the waves; no sails for winds to carry off; no boilers for steam to blow up; no fires to fear, because the submersible is made of sheet iron, not wood; no coal to run out of, since its propulsive power is electricity; no collisions to fear, because it navigates the watery deep all by itself; no storms to brave, because just a few yards under the waves, it finds absolute tranquillity! There, sir, there's a ship beyond compare! And if it's true that the engineer has more confidence in a craft than the builder, and the builder more than the captain himself, you can appreciate the utter abandon with which I put my trust in this Nautilus, since I'm its captain, builder, and engineer all in one!”"
"— En effet, répondit en souriant le capitaine, et sous ce rapport, les modernes ne sont pas plus avancés que les anciens. Il a fallu bien des siècles pour trouver la puissance mécanique de la vapeur ! Qui sait si dans cent ans, on verra un second Nautilus ! Les progrès sont lents, monsieur Aronnax.","""Indeed,"" replied the captain, smiling, ""and in this respect the moderns are no more advanced than the ancients."" It took many centuries to find the mechanical power of steam! Who knows if in a hundred years, we will see a second Nautilus! Progress is slow, Mr. Aronnax.","‘Indeed,’ the captain replied smiling, ‘but in this respect, the moderns are little further advanced than the ancients. Many centuries were needed to discover the mechanical power of steam! Who knows whether a second Nautilus will appear in the next hundred years! Progress is slow, Dr Aronnax.’","“Just so,” replied the captain, smiling; “and in that respect moderns are not more advanced than the ancients. It required many ages to find out the mechanical power of steam. Who knows if, in another hundred years, we may not see a second Nautilus? Progress is slow, M. Aronnax.”","“True,” the captain replied with a smile, “and in this respect the moderns aren't much farther along than the ancients. It took many centuries to discover the mechanical power of steam.

"Je pris le cigare qui m’était offert, et dont la forme rappelait celle du londrès ; mais il semblait fabriqué avec des feuilles d’or.

"J’estimai que ce coup de filet rapportait plus de mille livres de poissons. C’était une belle pêche, mais non surprenante. En effet, ces filets restent à la traîne pendant plusieurs heures et enserrent dans leur prison de fil tout un monde aquatique. Nous ne devions donc pas manquer de vivres d’une excellente qualité, que la rapidité du Nautilus et l’attraction de sa lumière électrique pouvaient renouveler sans cesse.","I estimated that this dragnet brought in over a thousand pounds of fish. It was a nice catch, but not surprising. Indeed, these nets remain behind for several hours and enclose in their prison of thread an entire aquatic world. We must therefore not lack provisions of an excellent quality, which the speed of the Nautilus and the attraction of its electric light could constantly renew.","I estimated that this operation was netting nearly half a ton of fish. It was a good catch, but not unexpected. The nets had been dragging for several hours and had captured a whole aquatic world in their stranded prison. We were guaranteed indefinite supplies of food of excellent quality, thanks to the Nautilus’s speed and the attraction of its electric light.","I reckoned that the haul had brought in more than nine hundredweight of fish. It was a fine haul, but not to be wondered at. Indeed, the nets are let down for several hours, and inclose in their meshes an infinite variety. We had no lack of excellent food, and the rapidity of the Nautilus and the attraction of the electric light could always renew our supply.","I estimate that this cast of the net brought in more than a thousand pounds of fish. It was a fine catch but hardly surprising. In essence those nets stayed in our wake for several hours, incarcerating a whole aquatic world in prisons made of thread. So we were never short of high-quality provisions, which the Nautilus's speed and the allure of its electric light could continually replenish."
"Après quelques minutes, un vif sifflement parvint à mon oreille. Je sentis une certaine impression de froid monter de mes pieds à ma poitrine. Évidemment, de l’intérieur du bateau on avait, par un robinet, donné entrée à l’eau extérieure qui nous envahissait, et dont cette chambre fut bientôt remplie. Une seconde porte, percée dans le flanc du Nautilus, s’ouvrit alors. Un demi-jour nous éclaira. Un instant après, nos pieds foulaient le fond de la mer.","After a few minutes, a loud hiss came to my ear. I felt a certain feeling of cold rise from my feet to my chest. Obviously, from inside the boat we had, by a tap, given entrance to the outside water which invaded us, and with which this room was soon filled. A second door, pierced in the side of the Nautilus, then opened. A half-light enlightened us. A moment later, our feet trod the bottom of the sea.","After a moment, a loud hissing sound reached my ears. Cold started rising from my feet to my chest.

"Le retour commença. Le capitaine Nemo avait repris la tête de sa petite troupe, se dirigeant toujours sans hésiter. Je crus voir que nous ne suivions pas le même chemin pour revenir au Nautilus. Cette nouvelle route, très raide, et par conséquent très pénible, nous rapprocha rapidement de la surface de la mer. Cependant, ce retour dans les couches supérieures ne fut pas tellement subit que la décompression se fit trop rapidement, ce qui aurait pu amener dans notre organisme des désordres graves, et déterminer ces lésions internes si fatales aux plongeurs. Très promptement, la lumière reparut et grandit, et, le soleil étant déjà bas sur l’horizon, la réfraction borda de nouveau les divers objets d’un anneau spectral.","The return began.

However, this return to the upper strata was not so sudden that decompression occurred too quickly, for this would have caused grave disorders to our bodies, producing those internal injuries so fatal to divers. Very soon daylight came back and grew stronger, and since the sun was already low on the horizon, the refraction again gave many objects a spectral ring.","The return began.

"« Ami Ned, dis-je, voici ma réponse. Vous avez raison contre moi, et mes arguments ne peuvent tenir devant les vôtres. Il ne faut pas compter sur la bonne volonté du capitaine Nemo.

"Les morses ressemblent aux phoques par la forme de leurs corps et par la disposition de leurs membres. Mais les canines et les incisives manquent à leur mâchoire inférieure, et quant aux canines supérieures, ce sont deux défenses longues de quatre-vingts centimètres qui en mesurent trente-trois à la circonférence de leur alvéole. Ces dents, faites d’un ivoire compact et sans stries, plus dur que celui des éléphants, et moins prompt à jaunir, sont très recherchées. Aussi les morses sont-ils en butte à une chasse inconsidérée qui les détruira bientôt jusqu’au dernier, puisque les chasseurs, massacrant indistinctement les femelles pleines et les jeunes, en détruisent chaque année plus de quatre mille.","Walruses resemble seals in the shape of their bodies and the arrangement of their limbs. But the canines and incisors are missing from their lower jaw, and as for the upper canines, they are two tusks eighty centimeters long which measure thirty-three in the circumference of their socket. These teeth, made of compact, streak-free ivory, harder than that of elephants and less likely to yellow, are highly sought after. Also, the walruses are the target of reckless hunting which will soon destroy every last one of them, since the hunters, indiscriminately massacring pregnant females and young ones, destroy more than four thousand of them every year.","Walruses resemble seals as regards the shape of their bodies and the way their limbs are attached, but have no canines or incisors in their lower jaws; and their upper canines form tusks 80 centimetres long and 33 centimetres in circumference where they join the body. These teeth are very much sought after, being made of compact ivory without ridges, harder than elephants’ and less prone to yellowing. As a result, walruses are excessively hunted, and will soon be destroyed down to the last, since the hunters indiscriminately massacre the pregnant females and their young, destroying in fact more than four thousand of them each year.","As I passed near these curious animals, I could examine them leisurely, for they did not move, Their skins were thick and rugged, of a yellowish tint, approaching to red; their hair was short and scant.","Walruses resemble seals in their body shape and the layout of their limbs. But their lower jaws lack canines and incisors; as for their upper canines, they consist of two tusks nearly a yard long and a foot around at the socket.

Accordingly walruses are the victims of a senseless hunting campaign that soon will destroy every last one of them, because their hunters indiscriminately slaughter pregnant females and youngsters, destroying over 4,000 individuals every year."

"« Monsieur le professeur, me dit alors le capitaine Nemo, on pêche des perles dans le golfe du Bengale, dans la mer des Indes, dans les mers de Chine et du Japon, dans les mers du sud de l’Amérique, au golfe de Panama, au golfe de Californie ; mais c’est à Ceylan que cette pêche obtient les plus beaux résultats. Nous arrivons un peu tôt, sans doute. Les pêcheurs ne se rassemblent que pendant le mois de mars au golfe de Manaar, et là, pendant trente jours, leurs trois cents bateaux se livrent à cette lucrative exploitation des trésors de la mer. Chaque bateau est monté par dix rameurs et par dix pêcheurs. Ceux-ci, divisés en deux groupes, plongent alternativement et descendent à une profondeur de douze mètres au moyen d’une lourde pierre qu’ils saisissent entre leurs pieds et qu’une corde rattache au bateau.","""Professor,"" Captain Nemo told me then, ""pearls are fished in the Bay of Bengal, in the Indian Sea, in the seas of China and Japan, in the seas of South America, in the Gulf of Panama, to the Gulf of California; but it is in Ceylon that this fishery obtains the finest results. We arrive a little early, no doubt. The fishermen gather only during the month of March at the Gulf of Manaar, and there, for thirty days, their three hundred boats are engaged in this lucrative exploitation of the treasures of the sea. Each boat is manned by ten rowers and by ten fishermen . These, divided into two groups, dive alternately and descend to a depth of twelve meters by means of a heavy stone which they seize between their feet and which a rope attaches to the boat.","‘Dr Aronnax,’ Captain Nemo continued, ‘pearls are fished in the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean and in the seas of China and Japan, of South America, of the Gulf of Panama, and of the Gulf of California; but it is Ceylon that has the best catches.

"J’ai dit que le Nautilus s’était écarté dans l’est. J’aurais dû dire, plus exactement, dans le nord-est. Pendant quelques jours, il erra tantôt à la surface des flots, tantôt au-dessous, au milieu de ces brumes si redoutables aux navigateurs. Elles sont principalement dues à la fonte des glaces, qui entretient une extrême humidité dans l’atmosphère. Que de navires perdus dans ces parages, lorsqu’ils allaient reconnaître les feux incertains de la côte ! Que de sinistres dus à ces brouillards opaques ! Que de chocs sur ces écueils dont le ressac est éteint par le bruit du vent ! Que de collisions entre les bâtiments, malgré leurs feux de position, malgré les avertissements de leurs sifflets et de leurs cloches d’alarme !","I said the Nautilus had moved away to the east. I should have said, more accurately, in the northeast. For a few days he wandered sometimes on the surface of the waves, sometimes below, in the midst of those mists so formidable to navigators. They are mainly due to the melting of the ice, which maintains extreme humidity in the atmosphere. How many ships lost in these parts, when they went to reconnoitre the uncertain fires of the coast! What disasters due to these opaque mists! What shocks on these reefs whose undertow is extinguished by the noise of the wind! How many collisions between buildings, despite their position lights, despite the warnings of their whistles and their alarm bells!","I have said that the Nautilus headed east. More precisely, I should have said north-east. For several days it wandered, now beneath the surface, now on top amongst those fogs that are so feared by navigators.

"Cependant j’examinais attentivement ces vagues déchaînées. Elles mesuraient jusqu’à quinze mètres de hauteur sur une longueur de cent cinquante a cent soixante-quinze mètres, et leur vitesse de propagation. moitié de celle du vent, était de quinze mètres à la seconde. Leur volume et leur puissance s’accroissaient avec la profondeur des eaux. Je compris alors le rôle de ces lames qui emprisonnent l’air dans leurs flancs et le refoulent au fond des mers où elles portent la vie avec l’oxygène. Leur extrême force de pression — on l’a calculée peut s’élever jusqu’à trois mille kilogrammes par pied carré de la surface qu’elles contrebattent. Ce sont de telles lames qui, aux Hébrides, ont déplacé un bloc pesant quatre-vingt-quatre mille livres. Ce sont elles qui, dans la tempête du 23 décembre 1864, après avoir renversé une partie de la ville de Yéddo, au Japon, faisant sept cents kilomètres à l’heure, allèrent se briser le même jour sur les rivages de l’Amérique.","However, I carefully examined these raging waves. They measured up to fifteen meters in height over a length of one hundred and fifty to one hundred and seventy-five meters, and their speed of propagation. half that of the wind, was fifteen meters per second. Their volume and power increased with the depth of the waters. I then understood the role of these waves that trap air in their sides and push it back to the bottom of the seas where they carry life with oxygen. Their extreme force of pressure - it has been calculated - can amount to three thousand kilograms per square foot of the surface which they counteract. It was such blades that in the Hebrides moved a block weighing eighty-four thousand pounds. They are the ones which, in the storm of December 23, 1864, after overthrowing part of the city of Yeddo, in Japan, doing seven hundred kilometers an hour, went to break the same day on the shores of America.","I carefully examined the unbridled waves. They measured up to 15 metres high by 150 to 175 metres long, and their speed was 15 metres a second, or half that of the wind. Their volume and power increased with the depth of the water. I understood then the function of the waves, capturing air and sending it down to the bottom of the sea, including life-giving oxygen. It has been calculated that their pressure reaches the enormous figure of 3,000 kilograms per square foot of the surface they batter. It was waves like this which moved a block in the Hebrides weighing 42 tons. It was they that, having flattened part of Tokyo in the Japanese storm of 23 December 1854,* went and broke on the shores of America the very same day, having crossed at 700 kilometres an hour.","However, I watched these raging waves attentively. They measured fifteen feet in height, and 150 to 175 yards long, and their speed of propagation was thirty feet per second. Their bulk and power increased with the depth of the water. Such waves as these at the Hebrides have displaced a mass weighing 8,400 lbs. They are they which, in the tempest of December 23, 1864, after destroying the town of Yeddo, in Japan, broke the same day on the shores of America. cd","Meanwhile I carefully examined those unleashed breakers. They measured up to 50 feet in height over an approximate length of 500 to 600 feet, and they moved at a speed of almost thirty-five miles per hour, a third that of the wind. Their size and strength increased with the water's depth. Then I understood the role played by those waves, which trap air in their flanks and release it deep underwater where its oxygen brings life. It's estimated that their maximum pressure is as much as 6,600 pounds per square foot on any surface they smash against. In the Hebrides it was waves such as these that repositioned a boulder weighing forty-two tons. It was their brethren in the tidal wave on December 23, 1854, that toppled part of the Japanese city of Tokyo, then raced that same day at over 400 miles per hour to crash into the coastline of America."

They had skilful half-naked paddlers in them, and it was not without trepidation that I saw them advancing.","Conseil was in earnest, but I was not of his opinion. However, the situation had changed some minutes before, and we had not perceived. A score of canoes surrounded the Nautilus.

They were managed by skillful, half-naked paddlers, and I watched their advance with some uneasiness.","Conseil was in dead earnest, but I didn't subscribe to his views.

"— Le Nautilus ne s’est pas échoué, monsieur, me répondit froidement le capitaine Nemo. Le Nautilus est fait pour reposer sur le lit des mers, et les pénibles travaux, les manœuvres qu’imposa à d’Urville le renflouage de ses corvettes, je ne les entreprendrai pas. L’Astrolabe et la Zélée ont failli périr, mais mon Nautilus ne court aucun danger. Demain, au jour dit, à l’heure dite, la marée le soulèvera paisiblement, et il reprendra sa navigation à travers les mers.","“The Nautilus didn’t run aground, sir,” Captain Nemo replied coldly. The Nautilus is made to rest on the bed of the sea, and the painful labors, the maneuvers imposed on d'Urville to bail out his corvettes, I will not undertake them. The Astrolabe and the Zélée almost perished, but my Nautilus is in no danger. Tomorrow, on the appointed day, at the appointed hour, the tide will lift him peacefully, and he will resume his navigation across the seas.","Captain Nemo coldly replied. ‘The Nautilus is designed to rest on the seabed; and I do not have to undertake the demanding work and manoeuvres that d’Urville had to perform to refloat his corvettes. The Astrolabe and Zélée nearly perished, but my Nautilus is in no danger. At the said hour tomorrow, the tide will lift it calmly up, to continue its navigation through the seas.’","“To-morrow,” added the captain, rising, “to-morrow, at twenty minutes to three P.M., the Nautilus shall float, and leave the Strait of Torres uninjured.”","“Sir, the Nautilus isn't aground,” Captain Nemo replied icily. “The Nautilus was built to rest on the ocean floor, and I don't need to perform the arduous labors and maneuvers d'Urville had to undertake in order to float off his sloops of war. The Zealous and the second Astrolabe nearly perished, but my Nautilus is in no danger. Tomorrow, at the appointed hour on the appointed day, the tide will quietly lift it off and it will resume its navigating through the seas.”"

"La mer de Sargasses, à proprement parler, couvre toute la partie immergée de l’Atlantide. Certains auteurs ont même admis que ces nombreuses herbes dont elle est semée sont arrachées aux prairies de cet ancien continent. Il est plus probable, cependant, que ces herbages, algues et fucus, enlevés au rivage de l’Europe et de l’Amérique, sont entraînés jusqu’à cette zone par le Gulf Stream. Ce fut là une des raisons qui amenèrent Colomb à supposer l’existence d’un nouveau monde. Lorsque les navires de ce hardi chercheur arrivèrent à la mer de Sargasses, ils naviguèrent non sans peine au milieu de ces herbes qui arrêtaient leur marche au grand effroi des équipages, et ils perdirent trois longues semaines à les traverser.","The Sargasso Sea, strictly speaking, covers the entire submerged part of Atlantis. Some authors have even admitted that the many herbs with which it is sown are torn from the prairies of this ancient continent. It is more likely, however, that these grasses, algae and fucus, removed from the shores of Europe and America, are carried to this area by the Gulf Stream. This was one of the reasons that led Columbus to suppose the existence of a new world. When the ships of this bold researcher arrived at the Sargasso Sea, they navigated not without difficulty in the middle of these grasses which stopped their progress to the great terror of the crews, and they lost three long weeks crossing them.","The Sargasso Sea, to be precise, covers the whole submerged area of Atlantis. Some authors have even claimed that the numerous grasses with which it is strewn are torn from the plains of the submerged continent. It is more probable, however, that the grasses, seaweeds, and wracks are taken from the shores of Europe and America and carried into this area by the Gulf Stream. This was one of the reasons that led Columbus to suppose a new world existed. When the ships of the bold searcher arrived in the Sargasso Sea, they had problems sailing through the grasses which stopped their progress, to the great alarm of his crews, and they wasted three long weeks crossing them.","This second arm—it is rather a collar than an arm—surrounds with its circles of warm water that portion of the cold, quiet, immovable ocean called the Sargasso Sea, a perfect lake in the open Atlantic: it takes no less than three years for the great current to pass round it.","The Sargasso Sea proper covers the whole submerged region of Atlantis. Some writers have even held that the many weeds scattered over this sea were uprooted from the prairies of that ancient continent. It's more likely, however, that those grasses, algae, and fucus plants were carried off from the shores of Europe and America, then taken as far as this zone by the Gulf Stream. Which is one of the reasons why Christopher Columbus believed in the existence of a New World. When the ships of that bold investigator arrived in the Sargasso Sea, they had difficulty navigating in the midst of these weeds, which, much to their crews’ dismay, brought them to a stop and made them waste three long weeks crossing this sector."

"Là, je puis dire qu’à perte de vue autour de nous, les terres et les glaçons étaient encombrés de mammifères marins, et je cherchais involontairement du regard le vieux Protée, le mythologique pasteur qui gardait ces immenses troupeaux de Neptune. C’étaient particulièrement des phoques. Ils formaient des groupes distincts, mâles et femelles, le père veillant sur sa famille, la mère allaitant ses petits, quelques jeunes, déjà forts, s’émancipant à quelques pas. Lorsque ces mammifères voulaient se déplacer, ils allaient par petits sauts dus à la contraction de leur corps, et ils s’aidaient assez gauchement de leur imparfaite nageoire, qui, chez le lamantin, leur congénère, forme un véritable avant-bras. Je dois dire que, dans l’eau, leur élément par excellence, ces animaux à l’épine dorsale mobile, au bassin étroit, au poil ras et serré, aux pieds palmés, nagent admirablement. Au repos et sur terre, ils prenaient des attitudes extrêmement gracieuses. Aussi, les anciens, observant leur physionomie douce, leur regard expressif que ne saurait surpasser le plus beau regard de femme, leurs yeux veloutés et limpides, leurs poses charmantes, et les poétisant à leur manière, métamorphosèrent-ils les mâles en tritons, et les femelles en sirènes.","There, I can say that as far as the eye could see around us, the land and the ice cubes were cluttered with marine mammals, and I was involuntarily looking for old Proteus, the mythological shepherd who guarded these immense herds of Neptune. They were especially seals. They formed distinct groups, male and female, the father watching over his family, the mother nursing her young, a few youngsters, already strong, emancipating themselves a few steps away. When these mammals wanted to move, they went by small jumps due to the contraction of their body, and they helped themselves rather awkwardly with their imperfect fin, which, in the manatee, their congener, forms a real forearm. I must say that in water, their element par excellence, these animals with mobile backbones, narrow pelvises, close-cropped hair, webbed feet, swim admirably. At rest and on land, they assumed extremely graceful attitudes. Also, the ancients, observing their gentle countenance, their expressive gaze that could not surpass the most beautiful gaze of a woman, their velvety and limpid eyes, their charming poses, and poeticizing them in their own way, metamorphosed the males into tritons, and females in mermaids.","As far as the eye could see, the ground and ice-floes were covered with marine mammals, and I involuntarily looked for old Proteus, the mythological shepherd who watches over Neptune’s enormous flocks. Seals were particularly numerous. The males and females formed distinct groups, the father watching over his family, the mother suckling her babes, while some stronger juveniles were testing their independence a few feet away. When these mammals wanted to move they produced little jumps, contracting their bodies and helping themselves clumsily along with their imperfect fins, which form real forearms in their congeners, the manatees. I must say that in their natural element these animals swim admirably, with their flexible spines, narrow pelvises, short, close-knit coats, and webbed feet. When resting on the shore, they adopt extremely graceful attitudes. Accordingly, when the ancients observed their soft faces, charming poses, and deep, expressive, velvet eyes that the most beautiful woman would not be able to surpass, they poeticized them in their own way, changing the males into tritons* and the females into sirens.","There, I can aver that earth and ice were lost to sight by the numbers of sea-mammals covering them, and I involuntarily sought for old Proteus, the mythological shepherd who watched these immense flocks of Neptune. There were more seals than anything else, forming distinct groups, male and female, the father watching over his family, the mother suckling her little ones, some already strong enough to go a few steps. When they wished to change their place, they took little jumps, made by the contraction of their bodies, and helped awkwardly enough by their imperfect fin, which, as with the lamantin, their congener, forms a perfect forearm. I should say that in the water, which is their element—the spine of these creatures is flexible—with smooth and close skin and webbed feet, they swim admirably. In resting on the earth they take the most graceful attitudes. Thus the ancients, observing their soft and expressive looks, which cannot be surpassed by the most beautiful look a woman can give, their clear voluptuous eyes, their charming positions, and the poetry of their manners, metamorphosed them, the male into a triton and the female into a mermaid.","There, all about us, I swear that the shores and ice floes were packed with marine mammals as far as the eye could see, and I automatically looked around for old Proteus, that mythological shepherd who watched over Neptune's immense flocks. These were predominantly seals. The males and females formed well-defined groups, the father guarding his family, the mother suckling her babies, the stronger youngsters emancipated a few steps away. When these mammals wanted to relocate, they contracted their bodies and took little jumps, awkwardly assisted all the while by their misshapen flippers, which form actual forearms on their manatee relatives. In the water, their element beyond compare, I must say that these seals swim wonderfully, thanks to their flexible spines, narrow pelvises, clean-shaven coats, and webbed feet. Resting on shore, they assumed the most graceful positions. Accordingly their gentle features, their glances as expressive as the loveliest woman's, their soft, limpid eyes, and their beguiling poses all led the ancients to glorify them by metamorphosing the males into sea gods and the females into mermaids."

"Mes regards se reportèrent sur le manomètre. L’instrument indiquait une profondeur de six mille mètres. Notre immersion durait depuis une heure. Le Nautilus, glissant sur ses plans inclinés, s’enfonçait toujours. Les eaux désertes étaient admirablement transparentes et d’une diaphanité que rien ne saurait peindre. Une heure plus tard, nous étions par treize mille mètres — trois lieues et quart environ — et le fond de l’Océan ne se laissait pas pressentir.","My eyes fell on the manometer. The instrument indicated a depth of six thousand meters. Our immersion lasted for an hour. The Nautilus, gliding on its inclined planes, was still sinking. The deserted waters were admirably transparent and of a diaphanity that nothing could paint. An hour later we were at thirteen thousand meters — about three and a quarter leagues — and the bottom of the ocean could not be perceived.","My eyes turned to the pressure-gauge. It indicated a depth of 6,000 metres. We had been diving for an hour. The Nautilus, thanks to its inclined planes, was still descending. The deserted waters were beautifully transparent, of an indescribable clarity. An hour later, we were at 13,000 metres — approximately 3½ leagues — and the bottom of the ocean was still nowhere in sight.","At 7,000 fathoms I saw some blackish tops rising from the midst of the waters; but these summits might belong to high mountains like the Himalayas or Mont Blanc, even higher; and the depth of the abyss remained incalculable.","My eyes flew back to the pressure gauge. The instrument showed a depth of nearly 20,000 feet. We'd been submerging for an hour. The Nautilus slid downward on its slanting fins, still sinking. Those empty waters were wonderfully clear, their transparency impossible to convey. An hour later we were at 43,000 feet—over eight miles down—yet the ocean floor was nowhere in sight."
"Combien de temps restai-je ainsi plongé dans cet assoupissement, je ne pus l’évaluer ; mais lorsque je me réveillai, il me sembla que le soleil s’abaissait vers l’horizon.

"— J’en conviens, répond le Canadien, mais il faut risquer cela. La liberté vaut qu’on la paye. D’ailleurs, l’embarcation est solide, et quelques milles avec un vent qui porte ne sont pas une affaire. Qui sait si demain nous ne serons pas à cent lieues au large ?

So, to the grace of God and see you tonight! »","‘Admittedly,’ replied the Canadian, ‘but we have to risk that. Freedom is worth paying for. In any case, it’s a tough boat so a few miles with a following wind will not be much of a problem. Who knows if by tomorrow the submarine won’t be 100 leagues out to sea? So let’s rely on luck, and by ten or eleven o’clock we’ll either be on dry land or dead. So in God we trust, and till tonight!’","“That I allow,” replied the Canadian, “but we must risk that. Liberty is worth paying for; besides, the boat is strong, and a few miles with a fair wind to carry us is no great thing. Who knows but by tomorrow we may be a hundred leagues away? Let circumstances only favor us, and by ten or eleven oVigo Bay clock we shall have landed on some spot of terra firma, alive or dead. But adieu now till to-night.”","“I know,” the Canadian replied, “but that's a risk we have to take. Freedom's worth paying for.

"Vers le soir, Clermont-Tonnerre se fondit dans l’éloignement, et la route du Nautilus se modifia d’une manière sensible. Après avoir touché le tropique du Capricorne par le cent trente-cinquième degré de longitude, il se dirigea vers l’ouest-nord-ouest, remontant toute la zone intertropicale.

"La lumière, qui éclairait le sol jusqu’à trente pieds au-dessous de la surface de l’Océan, m’étonna par sa puissance. Les rayons solaires traversaient aisément cette masse aqueuse et en dissipaient la coloration. Je distinguais nettement les objets à une distance de cent mètres. Au-delà, les fonds se nuançaient des fines dégradations de l’outremer, puis ils bleuissaient dans les lointains, et s’effaçaient au milieu d’une vague obscurité. Véritablement, cette eau qui m’entourait n’était qu’une sorte d’air, plus dense que l’atmosphère terrestre, mais presque aussi diaphane. Au-dessus de moi, j’apercevais la calme surface de la mer.","The light, which illumined the ground thirty feet below the surface of the ocean, astonished me by its power. The sun's rays passed easily through this aqueous mass and dissipated its coloring. I could clearly distinguish objects at a distance of a hundred meters.

"Je remerciai le capitaine Nemo, et je m’approchai des rayons de la bibliothèque. Livres de science, de morale et de littérature, écrits en toute langue, y abondaient ; mais je ne vis pas un seul ouvrage d’économie politique ; ils semblaient être sévèrement proscrits du bord. Détail curieux, tous ces livres étaient indistinctement classés, en quelque langue qu’ils fussent écrits, et ce mélange prouvait que le capitaine du Nautilus devait lire couramment les volumes que sa main prenait au hasard.","I thanked Captain Nemo, and approached the shelves of the library. Books on science, morals, and literature, written in every language, abounded there; but I did not see a single work on political economy; they seemed to be severely banished from boarding.

Books abounded on science, on ethics, and on literature, written in every language, but I could not see a single work of political economy, which seemed totally prohibited on board.

"Un autre habitant de ces mers attira mon attention et ramena dans mon esprit tous les souvenirs de l’antiquité. Ce fut le rémora qui voyage attaché au ventre des requins ; au dire des anciens, ce petit poisson, accroché à la carène d’un navire, pouvait l’arrêter dans sa marche, et l’un d’eux, retenant le vaisseau d’Antoine pendant la bataille d’Actium, facilita ainsi la victoire d’Auguste. A quoi tiennent les destinées des nations ! J’observai également d’admirables anthias qui appartiennent à l’ordre des lutjans, poissons sacrés pour les Grecs qui leur attribuaient le pouvoir de chasser les monstres marins des eaux qu’ils fréquentaient ; leur nom signifie, fleur, et ils le justifiaient par leurs couleurs chatoyantes, leurs nuances comprises dans la gamme du rouge depuis la pâleur du rose jusqu’à l’éclat du rubis, et les fugitifs reflets qui moiraient leur nageoire dorsale. Mes yeux ne pouvaient se détacher de ces merveilles de la mer, quand ils furent frappés soudain par une apparition inattendue.","Another inhabitant of these seas caught my attention and brought back to my mind all the memories of antiquity. It was the remora that travels attached to the bellies of sharks; according to the ancients, this little fish, clinging to the hull of a ship, could stop it in its progress, and one of them, holding Antony's ship during the battle of Actium, thus facilitated the Augustus' victory. On what do the destinies of nations depend! I also observed admirable anthias which belong to the order of snappers, sacred fish for the Greeks who attributed to them the power to hunt sea monsters from the waters they frequented; their name means, flower, and they justified it by their shimmering colors, their shades included in the range of red from the pallor of pink to the brilliance of ruby, and the fugitive reflections which shimmer their dorsal fin. My eyes could not tear themselves away from these marvels of the sea, when they were suddenly struck by an unexpected apparition.","Another inhabitant of these seas caught my attention and brought back all my memories of antiquity. This was the remora, which travels attached to the bellies of sharks. According to the ancients, this small fish, attached to the keel of a ship, could stop it moving, and one of them held back Mark Antony’s vessel at the Battle of Actium, in this way helping Augustus to victory. * On such things hang the destinies of nations! I also observed admirable Anthias from the family of Lutjanidae, fish sacred to the Greeks who attributed to them the power of expelling marine monsters from the waters they frequented; their name means ‘flowers’, which they justified with their shimmering colours, their reds going from scarlet to pale pink to the brilliance of rubies, and their fleeting, glistening hues seeming to moisten their dorsal fins. My eyes could not tear themselves away from the wonders of the sea — but were suddenly struck by an unexpected sight.","Another inhabitant of these seas drew my attention, and led my mind back to recollections of antiquity.

On how little hangs the destiny of nations! I observed some fine anthiæ, which belong to the order of lutjans, a fish held sacred by the Greeks, who attributed to them the power of hunting the marine monsters from waters they frequented. Their name signifies flower, and they justify their appellation by their shaded colors, their shades comprising the whole gamut of reds, from the paleness of the rose to the brightness of the ruby, and the fugitive tints that clouded their dorsal fin. My eyes could not leave these wonders of the sea, when they were suddenly struck by an unexpected apparition.","Another resident of these seas caught my attention and reawakened all my memories of antiquity. This was the remora, which travels attached to the bellies of sharks; as the ancients tell it, when these little fish stick to the underside of a ship, they can bring it to a halt, and by impeding Mark Antony's vessel during the Battle of Actium, one of them contributed to the victory of Augustus Caesar. From such slender threads hang the destinies of nations! I likewise noticed some wonderful snappers belonging to the family Lutjanidae, sacred fish for the Greeks, who believed these creatures could drive off sea monsters from the waters they frequent; their Greek name Anthias means “flower,” and they live up to it with their glistening scales and the shifting gleams that turn their dorsal fins into watered silk; their coloring is confined to a gamut of reds from pale pink to radiant ruby. I couldn't take my eyes off these ocean wonders—when an unexpected sight suddenly gave me a jolt."

"Une semblable démarche me répugnait. Suivant moi, elle ne pouvait aboutir. Il ne fallait rien espérer du commandant du Nautilus, mais tout de nous seuls.

"Quelques heures s’écoulèrent. J’observais souvent les instruments suspendus à la paroi du salon.

"Le plafond lumineux avait été éteint, et cependant, le salon resplendissait d’une lumière intense. C’est que la puissante réverbération des parois de glace y renvoyait violemment les nappes du fanal. Je ne saurais peindre l’effet des rayons voltaïques sur ces grands blocs capricieusement découpés, dont chaque angle, chaque arête, chaque facette, jetait une lueur différente, suivant la nature des veines qui couraient dans la glace. Mine éblouissante de gemmes, et particulièrement de saphirs qui croisaient leurs jets bleus avec le jet vert des émeraudes. Çà et là des nuances opalines d’une douceur infinie couraient au milieu de points ardents comme autant de diamants de feu dont l’œil ne pouvait soutenir l’éclat. La puissance du fanal était centuplée, comme celle d’une lampe à travers les lames lenticulaires d’un phare de premier ordre.","The luminous ceiling had been extinguished, and yet the living room shone with an intense light. It is because the powerful reverberation of the walls of ice violently sent back the sheets of the lantern. I could not paint the effect of the voltaic rays on these great capriciously cut blocks, of which each angle, each edge, each facet, cast a different light, according to the nature of the veins which ran in the ice. A dazzling mine of gems, and particularly of sapphires which crossed their blue jets with the green jet of emeralds. Here and there opaline shades of infinite softness ran amid fiery points like so many fiery diamonds whose brilliance the eye could not sustain. The power of the lantern was increased a hundredfold, like that of a lamp through the lenticular blades of a first-rate lighthouse.","The luminous ceiling had been switched off, and yet the salon was scintillating in intense light. The reason was the powerful illumination from the walls of ice, violently throwing back the searchlight’s beams. I cannot depict the impact of the voltaic rays on these great, capriciously carved blocks, with each angle, each corner, each facet radiating a different effect, according to the nature of the veins running through it. A glittering mine of gems, especially sapphires, crisscrossing their blue rays with shafts of emerald green. Here and there opaline shades of infinite subtlety ran through the shining points like fiery diamonds, unbearably dazzling the eye. The power of the searchlight was multiplied a hundred times, like that of a lamp through the lenses of a lighthouse of the first order.","The luminous ceiling had been extinguished, but the saloon was still resplendent with intense light. It was the powerful reflection from the glass partition sent violently back to the sheets of the lantern.

Here and there were opal shades of wonderful softness, running through bright spots like diamonds of fire, the brilliancy of which the eye could not bear. The power of the lantern seemed increased a hundredfold, like a lamp through the lenticular plates of a first-class lighthouse.","The ceiling lights were off, yet the lounge was still brightly lit. This was due to the reflecting power of those walls of ice, which threw the beams of our beacon right back at us. Words can't describe the effectscreated by our galvanic rays on those huge, eccentrically carved chunks of ice, all their corners, ridges, and facets giving off a different glimmer according to the nature of the veins running inside them. It was like adazzling mine of gemstones, especially sapphires and emeralds that threw off crisscrossing jets of blue and green. Here and there the soft, subtle hues of opals darted among sparkling diamonds whose fiery brilliance was more than any eye could stand. The power of our beacon was magnified a hundred times over, like a lamp through the biconvex lenses of a world-class lighthouse."

"Après avoir quitté ces îles charmantes protégées par le pavillon français, du 4 au 11 décembre, le Nautilus parcourut environ deux mille milles.

"Enfin, après deux heures de marche, nous avions atteint une profondeur de trois cents mètres environ, c’est-à-dire la limite extrême sur laquelle le corail commence à se former. Mais là, ce n’était plus le buisson isolé, ni le modeste taillis de basse futaie. C’était la forêt immense, les grandes végétations minérales, les énormes arbres pétrifiés, réunis par des guirlandes d’élégantes plumarias, ces lianes de la mer, toutes parées de nuances et de reflets.

We passed freely under their high foliage lost in the shadow of the waves, while at our feet the tubipores, the meanders, the stars, the fungi, the cariophylls, formed a carpet of flowers, strewn with dazzling gems.","After two hours’ march, we had finally reached a depth of about 300 metres, the furthest point where coral begins to form.

"Cependant, notre marche ascensionnelle fut bientôt arrêtée, à une hauteur de deux cent cinquante pieds environ, par d’infranchissables obstacles. La voussure intérieure revenait en surplomb, et la montée dut se changer en promenade circulaire. A ce dernier plan, le règne végétal commençait à lutter avec le règne minéral. Quelques arbustes et même certains arbres sortaient des anfractuosités de la paroi. Je reconnus des euphorhes qui laissaient couler leur suc caustique. Des héliotropes, très inhabiles à justifier leur nom, puisque les rayons solaires n’arrivaient jamais jusqu’à eux, penchaient tristement leurs grappes de fleurs aux couleurs et aux parfums à demi passés. Çà et là, quelques chrysanthèmes poussaient timidement au pied d’aloès à longues feuilles tristes et maladifs. Mais, entre les coulées de laves, j’aperçus de petites violettes, encore parfumées d’une légère odeur, et j’avoue que je les respirai avec délices. Le parfum, c’est l’âme de la fleur, et les fleurs de la mer, ces splendides hydrophytes, n’ont pas d’âme !","However, our upward march was soon checked, at a height of about two hundred and fifty feet, by impassable obstacles. The interior arch was overhanging, and the climb had to change into a circular promenade. At this last level, the vegetable kingdom began to struggle with the mineral kingdom. A few shrubs and even some trees protruded from the crevices in the wall. I recognized spurges letting their caustic juices flow. Heliotropes, very incapable of justifying their name, since the sun's rays never reached them, bent sadly their clusters of flowers with half-faded colors and perfumes. Here and there a few chrysanthemums grew timidly at the foot of the sad and sickly long-leaved aloes. But, between the lava flows, I saw small violets, still perfumed with a slight odor, and I confess that I inhaled them with delight. Perfume is the soul of the flower, and the flowers of the sea, those splendid hydrophytes, have no soul!","But our climb was interrupted by insurmountable obstacles at a height of approximately 250 feet.

"Le Nautilus se présenta donc à l’entrée du plus dangereux détroit du globe, de celui que les plus hardis navigateurs osent à peine franchir, détroit que Louis Paz de Torrès affronta en revenant des mers du Sud dans la Mélanésie, et dans lequel, en 1840, les corvettes échouées de Dumont d’Urville furent sur le point de se perdre corps et biens.

"En effet, le 20 juillet 1866, le steamer Governor-Higginson, de Calcutta and Burnach steam navigation Company, avait rencontré cette masse mouvante à cinq milles dans l’est des côtes de l’Australie.

Now, unless the sand-bank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapor.","To get down to cases, on July 20, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson from the Calcutta & Burnach Steam Navigation Co. met up with this moving mass 500 miles off the east coast of Australia.

"Ce nom de Sargasses vient du mot espagnol « sargazzo » qui signifie varech. Ce varech, le varech-nageur ou porte-baie, forme principalement ce banc immense. Et voici pourquoi, suivant le savant Maury, l’auteur de la Géographie physique du globe, ces hydrophytes se réunissent dans ce paisible bassin de l’Atlantique :","This name Sargassum comes from the Spanish word ""sargazzo"" which means kelp. This kelp, the swimming-kelp or bay-bearer, mainly forms this huge shoal. And here is why, according to the learned Maury, the author of the Physical Geography of the Globe, these hydrophytes meet in this peaceful basin of the Atlantic:","The name Sargasso comes from the Spanish sargazo * meaning ‘sea-wrack’. This sea-wrack, floating varec, or gulfweed, is the main constituent of the immense bed.

"Notre santé à tous se maintenait dans un état très satisfaisant. Le régime du bord nous convenait parfaitement, et pour mon compte, je me serais bien passé des variantes que Ned Land, par esprit de protestation, s’ingéniait à y apporter. De plus, dans cette température constante, il n’y avait pas même un rhume à craindre. D’ailleurs, ce madréporaire Dendrophyllée, connu en Provence sous le nom de « Fenouil de mer », et dont il existait une certaine réserve à bord, eût fourni avec la chair fondante de ses polypes une pâte excellente contre la toux.","The health of all of us remained in a very satisfactory state. The diet on board suited us perfectly, and for my part, I would have done without the variants that Ned Land, out of a spirit of protest, contrived to bring to it. Moreover, in this constant temperature, there was not even a cold to fear. Moreover, this madreporary Dendrophyllée, known in Provence under the name of “Sea Fennel”, and of which there was a certain reserve on board, would have provided with the melting flesh of its polyps an excellent paste against cough.","The health of all of us remained in a very satisfactory state. The diet on board suited us perfectly, and personally, I could easily have managed without the variety that Ned spent his efforts on producing, through a spirit of protest. Even colds were not frequent in this constant temperature. In any case, there was a supply of the stony coral dendrophyllia on board, known in the South of France as sea fennel, which provided an excellent cough pastille in the form of its polyps’ melting flesh.","To anyone but myself, who had a great love for the sea, the hours would have seemed long and monotonous; but the daily walks on the platform, when I steeped myself in the reviving air of the ocean, the sight of the rich waters through the windows of the saloon, the books in the library, the compiling of my memoirs, took up all my time, and left me not a moment of ennui or weariness.","All in all we enjoyed a highly satisfactory state of health. The diet on board agreed with us perfectly, and speaking for myself, I could easily have managed without those changes of pace that Ned Land, in a spirit of rebellion, kept taxing his ingenuity to supply us. What's more, in this regulated temperature we didn't even have to worry about catching colds. Besides, the ship had a good stock of the madrepore Dendrophyllia, known in Provence by the name sea fennel, and lozenges prepared from the dissolved flesh of its polyps make a first-class cough medicine."
"Ned Land avait donc eu raison de craindre. Dans ces larges mers, privées d’îles, il ne fallait plus tenter de quitter le bord. Nul moyen non plus de s’opposer aux volontés du capitaine Nemo. Le seul parti était de se soumettre ; mais ce qu’on ne devait plus attendre de la force ou de la ruse, j’aimais à penser qu’on pourrait l’obtenir par la persuasion. Ce voyage terminé, le capitaine Nemo ne consentirait-il pas à nous rendre la liberté sous serment de ne jamais révéler son existence ? Serment d’honneur que nous aurions tenu. Mais il fallait traiter cette délicate question avec le capitaine. Or, serais-je bien venu à réclamer cette liberté ? Lui-même n’avait-il pas déclaré, dès le début et d’une façon formelle, que le secret de sa vie exigeait notre emprisonnement perpétuel à bord du Nautilus ? Mon silence, depuis quatre mois, ne devait-il pas lui paraître une acceptation tacite de cette situation ? Revenir sur ce sujet n’aurait-il pas pour résultat de donner des soupçons qui pourraient nuire à nos projets, si quelque circonstance favorable se présentait plus tard de les reprendre ? Toutes ces raisons, je les pesais, je les retournais dans mon esprit, je les soumettais à Conseil qui n’était pas moins embarrassé que moi. En somme, bien que je ne fusse pas facile à décourager, je comprenais que les chances de jamais revoir mes semblables diminuaient de jour en jour, surtout en ce moment où le capitaine Nemo courait en téméraire vers le sud de l’Atlantique !","Ned Land had therefore been right to fear. In these wide seas, deprived of islands, it was no longer necessary to try to leave the edge. No way either to oppose the wishes of Captain Nemo. The only course was to submit; but what one should no longer expect from force or cunning, I liked to think that one could obtain by persuasion. This trip over, wouldn't Captain Nemo agree to set us free on oath never to reveal his existence? Oath of honor that we would have kept. But it was necessary to discuss this delicate question with the captain. Now, would I have come to claim this freedom? Hadn't he himself declared, from the start and in a formal way, that the secret of his life demanded our perpetual imprisonment on board the Nautilus? My silence for four months, shouldn't it seem to him a tacit acceptance of this situation? Wouldn't returning to this subject have the result of giving rise to suspicions which could harm our projects, if some favorable circumstance arose later to resume them? I weighed all these reasons, I turned them over in my mind, I submitted them to Conseil, who was no less embarrassed than I was. In short, although I was not easily discouraged, I understood that the chances of ever seeing my fellow human beings diminished day by day, especially at this moment when Captain Nemo was running recklessly towards the South Atlantic!","Ned had therefore been right to worry. In these wide seas, bereft of islands, we could not try to leave the vessel. Nor was there any way of opposing Captain Nemo’s wishes. The only choice was to submit; but what we were unable to obtain using brute strength or ruse, I liked to think we could obtain by means of persuasion. Once the voyage was over, might Captain Nemo not agree to give us back our freedom if we swore never to reveal his existence? An oath of honour which we would have kept. But we needed to discuss this delicate question with the captain as soon as possible. Would I receive a warm reception if I asked for this freedom? Had he not declared, at the beginning and in formal fashion, that the secret surrounding his life demanded that we be kept imprisoned on board the Nautilus for ever? Would my silence over the last four months not appear to be tacit acceptance of the situation? Wouldn’t raising the subject again cause suspicion which could hinder our plans if some favourable circumstance arose later? I weighed up all these questions, turned them over in my mind, and raised them with Conseil, but he remained just as undecided as I. The upshot was that, although not easily discouraged, I could see the chances of ever meeting my fellows again diminishing with each day, especially now that Captain Nemo was heading boldly towards the South Atlantic!","Ned Land had cause for fear. In these large seas, void of islands, we could not attempt to leave the boat. Nor had we any means of opposing Captain Nemo’s will. Our only course was to submit; but what we could neither gain by force nor cunning , I liked to think might be obtained by persuasion. This voyage ended, would he not consent to restore our liberty, under an oath never to reveal his existence—an oath of honor which we should have religiously kept? But we must consider that delicate question with the captain. But was I free to claim this liberty? Had he not himself said from the beginning, in the firmest manner, that the secret of his life exacted from him our lasting imprisonment on board the Nautilus? And would not my four months’ silence appear to him a tacit acceptance of our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our projects if at some future time a favorable opportunity offered to return to them?","So Ned Land had good reason to be anxious. There was no way we could jump ship in these wide seas that hadn't any islands. Nor could we oppose Captain Nemo's wishes. All we could do was play along; but if we couldn't achieve our ends through force or cunning, I hoped we could succeed through persuasion. When this voyage was over, wouldn't Captain Nemo agree to set us free in exchange for our promise to never reveal his existence? Our word of honor, which we would have kept without fail. However this delicate matter needed to be negotiated with the captain. But how would he receive our request for freedom? Right at the outset and in no uncertain terms, hadn't he stated that his secret existence required us to be permanently imprisoned aboard the Nautilus? Wasn't he sure to take my four-month silence as a tacit acceptance of the situation? Wouldn't bringing up this subject again only arouse suspicions that could hamper our escape plans, if we had promising circumstances for trying again later on? I weighed all these considerations, turned them over inmy mind, and ran them by Conseil, but he was as baffled as I was. In short, though I'm not easily discouraged, I could see that my chances of ever rejoining the human race were shrinking by the day, especially at a time when Captain Nemo was recklessly heading for the south Atlantic!"
"Là croissaient des éponges de toutes formes, des éponges pédiculées, foliacées, globuleuses, digitées. Elles justifiaient assez exactement ces noms de corbeilles, de calices, de quenouilles, de cornes d’élan, de pied de lion, de queue de paon, de gant de Neptune, que leur ont attribués les pêcheurs, plus poètes que les savants. De leur tissu fibreux, enduit d’une substance gélatineuse a demi fluide, s’échappaient incessamment de petits filets d’eau, qui après avoir porté la vie dans chaque cellule, en étaient expulsés par un mouvement contractile. Cette substance disparaît après la mort du polype, et se putréfie en dégageant de l’ammoniaque. Il ne reste plus alors que ces fibres cornées ou gélatineuses dont se compose l’éponge domestique, qui prend une teinte roussâtre, et qui s’emploie à des usages divers, selon son degré d’élasticité, de perméabilité ou de résistance à la macération.","There grew sponges of all shapes, sponges pedunculated, leafy, globose, digitate. They quite exactly justified the names of baskets, chalices, distaffs, elk horns, lion's foot, peacock's tail, Neptune's glove, attributed to them by fishermen, more poets than scholars. From their fibrous tissue, coated with a semi-fluid gelatinous substance, incessantly escaped small trickles of water, which after having carried life into each cell, were expelled by a contractile movement. This substance disappears after the death of the polyp, and putrefies by releasing ammonia. All that remains then are those horny or gelatinous fibers of which the household sponge is composed, which takes on a reddish tint, and which is used for various purposes, according to its degree of elasticity, permeability or resistance to maceration. .","There grew sponges of all forms: pediculate, foliaceous, globular, and digitate. They aptly deserved their names of baskets, chalices, bulrushes, elkhorns, lions’ feet, peacocks’ tails, and Neptune’s gloves, given them by fishermen, who are more poetic than scientific. Little dribbles of water, after carrying life into each cell, were constantly being squeezed out by their fibrous material, covered with a sticky, semi-fluid substance. This substance disappears after the death of the polypary and putrefies while giving off ammonia. Nothing then remains apart from the hard or gelatinous fibres making up the domestic sponge, which takes on a reddish tint and is used for various purposes, according to its degree of elasticity, permeability, and resistance to maceration.","The mollusks were represented by varieties of the calmar (which, according to Orbigny, are peculiar to the Red Sea); and reptiles by the virgata turtle, of the genus of cheloniæ, which furnished a wholesome and delicate food for our table.","There sponges grew in all sorts of shapes, stalklike, leafy, globular, fingerlike. With reasonable accuracy they lived up to their nicknames of basket sponges, chalice sponges, cattail sponges, elk horn sponges, lion's paws, peacock's tails, and Neptune's gloves—monikers bestowed on them by fishermen, who are more poetically inclined than scientists. Smeared with a semiliquid, jelly like substance, the fibrous tissue of these sponges leaked continual trickles of water that had carried nutrients to each cell, then had been expelled by a contracting motion. This jellylike substance vanishes when the polyp dies, giving off ammonia as it decomposes. Finally all that's left are the fibers, either jellylike or made of horn, that constitute your household sponge, which turns a russet color and is used for various tasks depending on how elastic, porous, and durable it is."

"Cette façon de dire, l’imprévu de cette scène, cet historique du navire patriote froidement raconté d’abord, puis l’émotion avec laquelle l’étrange personnage avait prononcé ses dernières paroles, ce nom de Vengeur, dont la signification ne pouvait m’échapper, tout se réunissait pour frapper profondément mon esprit. Mes regards ne quittaient plus le capitaine. Lui, les mains tendues vers la mer, considérait d’un œil ardent la glorieuse épave. Peut-être ne devais-je jamais savoir qui il était, d’où il venait, où il allait, mais je voyais de plus en plus l’homme se dégager du savant. Ce n’était pas une misanthropie commune qui avait enfermé dans les flancs du Nautilus le capitaine Nemo et ses compagnons, mais une haine monstrueuse ou sublime que le temps ne pouvait affaiblir.","This way of speaking, the unexpectedness of this scene, this history of the patriot ship coldly told first, then the emotion with which the strange character had pronounced his last words, this name of Avenger, the meaning of which could not m escape, it all came together to strike my mind deeply. My eyes never left the captain. He, his hands outstretched towards the sea, gazed ardently at the glorious wreck. Perhaps I was never to know who he was, where he came from, where he was going, but more and more I saw the man free himself from the scientist. It was not a common misanthropy that had confined Captain Nemo and his companions to the sides of the Nautilus, but a monstrous or sublime hatred that time could not weaken.","The way he spoke, the unexpectedness of the scene, the recounting of the tale of the patriotic ship, and the vehemence with which this strange individual had pronounced the final words about the Vengeur, leaving me in no doubt about his meaning: everything combined to make a deep impression on me. My eyes no longer left the captain. Arm stretched out to sea, he was studying the glorious wreck* with glowing eyes. Perhaps I would never know who he was, where he came from, where he was going, but I could see the man more and more distinctly from the scientist. It was not common misanthropy that had enclosed Captain Nemo and his companions in the flanks of the Nautilus, but a monstrous or sublime hatred that time could not diminish.","THE WAY OF DESCRIBING this unlooked-for scene, the history of the patriot ship, told at first so coldly, and the emotion with which this strange man pronounced the last words, the name of the Avenger, the significance of which could not escape me, all impressed itself deeply on my mind. My eyes did not leave the captain, who, with his hand stretched out to sea, was watching with a glowing eye the glorious wreck. Perhaps I was never to know who he was, from whence he came, or where he was going to, but I saw the man move, and apart from the savant. It was no common misanthropy which had shut Captain Nemo and his companions within the Nautilus, but a hatred, either monstrous or sublime, which time could never weaken.","HIS MANNER OF SPEAKING, the unexpectedness of this episode, first the war record of thatpatriotic ship, then the intensity with which this strange individual spoke those last words—the name Avenger, whose significance couldn't elude me—all these things, taken together, had a deep impact on my mind. My eyes never left the captain. Hands reaching toward the sea, he pondered that proud wreck with glowing eyes. Maybe I would never find out who he was, where he came from, or where his destiny would take him, but more and more I could see a distinction between the man and the scientist. It was no routine distrust of humanity that kept Captain Nemo and his companions sequestered inside the Nautilus's plating, but a hatred that was so monstrous or sublime, age couldn't wither it."
"Cette rapidité se soutint pendant plusieurs jours, et le 9 avril, au soir, nous avions connaissance de la pointe la plus orientale de l’Amérique du Sud qui forme le cap San Roque. Mais alors le Nautilus s’écarta de nouveau, et il alla chercher à de plus grandes profondeurs une vallée sous-marine qui se creuse entre ce cap et Sierra Leone sur la côte africaine. Cette vallée se bifurque à la hauteur des Antilles et se termine au nord par une énorme dépression de neuf mille mètres. En cet endroit. La coupe géologique de l’Océan figure jusqu’aux petites Antilles une falaise de six kilomètres, taillée à pic. et, à la hauteur des îles du cap Vert, une autre muraille non moins considérable, qui enferment ainsi tout le continent immergé de l’Atlantide. Le fond de cette immense vallée est accidenté de quelques montagnes qui ménagent de pittoresques aspects à ces fonds sous-marins. J’en parle surtout d’après les cartes manuscrites que contenait la bibliothèque du Nautilus, cartes évidemment dues à la main du capitaine Nemo et levées sur ses observations personnelles.","This rapidity continued for several days, and on the evening of April 9, we learned of the easternmost point of South America, which forms Cape San Roque. But then the Nautilus moved away again, and she went to seek at greater depths an undersea valley which is hollowed out between this cape and Sierra Leone on the African coast. This valley forks at the level of the Antilles and ends in the north by an enormous depression of nine thousand meters. In this place. The geological cross-section of the ocean represents a sheer six-kilometre cliff as far as the Lesser Antilles. and, at the level of the islands of Cape Verde, another no less considerable wall, which thus encloses the whole submerged continent of Atlantis. The bottom of this immense valley is broken by a few mountains which provide picturesque aspects to these underwater beds. I speak of it above all from the manuscript maps contained in the library of the Nautilus, maps evidently due to the hand of Captain Nemo and taken from his personal observations.","This speed was maintained for several days, and in the evening of 9 April we sighted the easternmost point of South America, Cape São Roque. * But then the Nautilus moved offshore again, and went to seek greater depths in a sunken valley between this cape and Sierra Leone on the African coast. The valley divides off the West Indies, and finishes in the north in an enormous depression 9,000 metres deep. At that point, the geological cross-section of the ocean forms a cliff 6,000 metres high, cut sheer as far as the Lesser Antilles, and, together with a similar wall off Cape Verde, encloses the whole of the sunken continent of Atlantis. The floor of this enormous valley is broken up by a few mountains which contribute to the picturesque views of the submarine depths. I speak about such matters on the basis of the hand-drawn maps in the Nautilus’s library. Maps evidently produced by Captain Nemo, based on his personal observations.","This speed was kept up for several days, and in the evening of the 9th of April we sighted the most easterly point of South America that forms Cape San Roque. But then the Nautilus swerved again, and sought the lowest depth of a submarine valley, which is between this cape and Sierra Leone on the African coast. This valley bifurcates to the parallel of the Antilles, and terminates at the north by the enormous depression of 9,000 yards. In this place, the geological basin of the ocean forms, as far as the Lesser Antilles, a cliff of three and a half miles perpendicular in height, and at the parallel of the Cape Verde Islands, another wall not less considerable, that incloses thus all the sunk continent of the Atlantic. The bottom of this immense valley is dotted with some mountains, that give to these submarine places a picturesque aspect. I speak, moreover, from the manuscript charts that were in the library of the Nautilus-charts evidently due to Captain Nemo’s hand, and made after his personal observations.","We maintained this speed for several days and by the evening of April 9 we'd raised South America's easternmost tip, Cape São Roque. But the Nautilus veered away once more and went looking for the lowest depths of an underwater valley scooped out between this cape and Sierra Leone on the coast of Africa. Level with the West Indies, this valley splits into two arms and ends to the north in an enormous depression nearly 30,000 feet deep. From this locality to the Lesser Antilles, the ocean's geological profile features a sheer cliff over 3½ miles high, and off the Cape Verde Islands there's another wall just as substantial; together these two barricades fence in the whole submerged continent of Atlantis. A few mountains break up the floor of this immense valley, furnishing these underwater depths with scenic views. This description is based mostly on some hand-drawn charts kept in the Nautilus's library, charts obviously rendered by Captain Nemo himself from his own personal investigations."

"Le soir même, par 21°30’de latitude nord, le Nautilus, flottant à la surface de la mer, se rapprocha de la côte arabe.

"Certainement, j’étais sûr de ce garçon si dévoué.

"— En affaires, Ned, mais non en mathématiques. Écoutez-moi. Admettons que la pression d’une atmosphère soit représentée par la pression d’une colonne d’eau haute de trente-deux pieds. En réalité, la colonne d’eau serait d’une moindre hauteur, puisqu’il s’agit de l’eau de mer dont la densité est supérieure à celle de l’eau douce. Eh bien, quand vous plongez, Ned, autant de fois trente-deux pieds d’eau au-dessus de vous, autant de fois votre corps supporte une pression égale à celle de l’atmosphère, c’est-à-dire de kilogrammes par chaque centimètre carré de sa surface. Il suit de là qu’à trois cent vingt pieds cette pression est de dix atmosphères, de cent atmosphères à trois mille deux cents pieds, et de mille atmosphères à trente-deux mille pieds, soit deux lieues et demie environ. Ce qui équivaut à dire que si vous pouviez atteindre cette profondeur dans l’Océan, chaque centimètre carré de la surface de votre corps subirait une pression de mille kilogrammes. Or, mon brave Ned, savez-vous ce que vous avez de centimètres carrés en surface ?","'In business, Ned, but not in mathematics. Listen to me. Let the pressure of one atmosphere be represented by the pressure of a column of water thirty-two feet high. In reality, the water column would be of a lower height, since it is sea water whose density is greater than that of fresh water. Well, when you dive, Ned, that many times thirty-two feet of water above you, that many times your body supports a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere, that is, kilograms by every square centimeter of its surface. It follows from this that at three hundred and twenty feet this pressure is ten atmospheres, one hundred atmospheres at three thousand two hundred feet, and one thousand atmospheres at thirty-two thousand feet, or about two and a half leagues. This is equivalent to saying that if you could reach this depth in the ocean, every square centimeter of the surface of your body would be under a thousand kilograms of pressure. Now, my dear Ned, do you know how many square centimeters you have on the surface?","‘In business, Ned, but not in mathematics. Please listen. Let us assume that atmospheric pressure is equivalent to the pressure of a column of water 32 feet high. In reality the column would be shorter, since it would be sea water, which is denser than fresh water. Well, Ned, when you dive, your body undergoes a pressure equal to 1 atmosphere for every 32 feet of water you go down, that is 1 kilogram for each square centimetre of its surface. It follows that this pressure would be 10 atmospheres at 320 feet, 100 atmospheres at 3,200 feet, and 1,000 atmospheres at 32,000 feet, or about 2½ leagues. In other words, if you could reach this depth, each square centimetre on your body would be undergoing a pressure of 1,000 kilograms. Now, my good Ned, do you know how many square centimetres you have on your body?’","Listen to me. Let us admit that the pressure of the atmosphere is represented by the weight of a column of water thirty-two feet high. In reality the column of water would be shorter, as we are speaking of sea-water, the density of which is greater than that of fresh water. Very well, when you dive, Ned, as many times thirty-two feet of water as there are above you, so many times does your body bear a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere, that is to say 15 lbs. for each square inch of its surface. It follows, then, that at 320 feet this pressure equals that of 10 atmospheres, of 100 atmospheres at 3,200 feet, and of 1,000 atmospheresat 32,000 feet, that is, about 6 miles; which is equivalent to saying that, if you could attain this depth in the ocean, each square ⅜ of an inch of the surface of your body would bear a pressure of 5,600 lbs. Ah! my brave Ned, do you know how many square inches you carry on the surface of your body?”","“In business, Ned, but not in mathematics. Hear me out. Let's accept that the pressure of one atmosphere is represented by the pressure of a column of water 32 feet high. In reality this column of water wouldn't be quite so high because here we're dealing with salt water, which is denser than fresh water. Well then, when you dive under the waves, Ned, for every 32 feet of water above you, your body is tolerating the pressure of one more atmosphere, in other words, 14.2 pounds per each square inch on your body's surface. So it follows that at 320 feet down, this pressure is equal to ten atmospheres, to a hundred atmospheres at 3,200 feet, and to a thousand atmospheres at 32,000 feet, hence at around six miles down. Which is tantamount to saying that if you could reach this depth in the ocean, each square inch on your body's surface would be experiencing 14,200 pounds of pressure. Now then, my gallant Ned, do you know how many square inches there are on the surface of your body?”"

"Là, par trois ou quatre brasses d’eau, entre les récifs Pacou et Vanou, gisaient des ancres, des canons, des saumons de fer et de plomb, empâtés dans les concrétions calcaires.

"Ce fut pendant la nuit du 9 au 10 décembre, que le Nautilus rencontra cette armée de mollusques qui sont particulièrement nocturnes. On pouvait les compter par millions. Ils émigraient des zones tempérées vers les zones plus chaudes, en suivant l’itinéraire des harengs et des sardines.

"Non. Un choc m’apprit que le Nautilus avait heurté la surface inférieure de la banquise, très épaisse encore, à en juger par la matité du bruit. En effet, nous avions « touché » pour employer l’expression marine, mais en sens inverse et par mille pieds de profondeur. Ce qui donnait deux mille pieds de glaces au-dessus de nous, dont mille émergeaient. La banquise présentait alors une hauteur supérieure à celle que nous avions relevée sur ses bords. Circonstance peu rassurante.","No. A shock told me that the Nautilus had struck the lower surface of the pack ice, which was still very thick, judging by the dullness of the noise. Indeed, we had ""touched"" to use the marine expression, but in the opposite direction and a thousand feet deep. Which gave two thousand feet of ice above us, of which one thousand emerged. The pack ice then presented a height greater than that which we had noted on its edges. Not a reassuring circumstance.","No. A jolt told me that the Nautilus had hit the lower surface of the ice-cap, still very thick to judge from the dullness of the impact. We had ‘touched’, to employ the marine expression, but in the other direction and at a depth of 1,000 feet: there were 2,000 feet of ice above us, of which 1,000 emerged. The ice-cap thus reached a greater height than we had noted at its perimeter. Not a very reassuring fact.","No! A shock told me that the Nautilus had struck the bottom of the iceberg, still very thick, judging from the deadened sound. We had indeed “struck,” to use a sea expression, but in an inverse sense, and at a thousand feet deep. This would give three thousand feet of ice above us; one thousand being above the water-mark. The iceberg was then higher than at its borders—not a very reassuring fact.","Not yet. A sudden jolt told me the Nautilus had bumped the underbelly of the ice barrier, still very thick to judge from the dull sound it made. In fact we'd “struck bottom,” to use nautical terminology, but in the opposite direction and at a depth of 1,500 feet. That gave us 2,000 feet of ice overhead, of which 500 feet were above water. So the ice barrier was higher here than we'd found it on its outskirts. A circumstance not exactly encouraging."
"En cet instant, quelques eaux-fortes suspendues à la paroi et que je n’avais pas remarquées pendant ma première visite, frappèrent mes regards.

"« Monsieur le professeur, me dit-il, c’est un simple raisonnement de naturaliste qui m’a conduit a découvrir ce passage que je suis seul à connaître. J’avais remarqué que dans la mer Rouge et dans la Méditerranée, il existait un certain nombre de poissons d’espèces absolument identiques, des ophidies, des fiatoles, des girelles, des persègues, des jœls, des exocets. Certain de ce fait je me demandai s’il n’existait pas de communication entre les deux mers. Si elle existait, le courant souterrain devait forcément aller de la mer Rouge à la Méditerranée par le seul effet de la différence des niveaux. Je pêchai donc un grand nombre de poissons aux environs de Suez. Je leur passai à la queue un anneau de cuivre, et je les rejetai à la mer. Quelques mois plus tard, sur les côtes de Syrie, je reprenais quelques échantillons de mes poissons ornés de leur anneau indicateur. La communication entre les deux m’était donc démontrée. Je la cherchai avec mon Nautilus, je la découvris, je m’y aventurai, et avant peu, monsieur le professeur, vous aussi vous aurez franchi mon tunnel arabique ! »","“Professor,” he said to me, “it was simple naturalist reasoning that led me to discover this passage that only I know. I had noticed that in the Red Sea and in the Mediterranean, there were a certain number of fish of absolutely identical species, ophidia, fiatoles, wrasses, persegues, joels, exocets. Certain of this fact, I wondered if there was no communication between the two seas. If it existed, the underground current had to go from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean by the sole effect of the difference in levels. I therefore caught a large number of fish around Suez. I slipped a copper ring around their tails and threw them back into the sea. A few months later, on the coast of Syria, I took some samples of my fish adorned with their indicator ring. The communication between the two was thus demonstrated to me. I looked for it with my Nautilus, I discovered it, I ventured there, and before long, Professor, you too will have passed through my Arabian tunnel! »","‘It was the simple reasoning of a naturalist that led me to discover the passage which I alone know about.

Given this fact, I wondered if there might not be some link between the two. If it did exist, the underground current had to go from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean because of the difference in the levels. So I caught a large number of fish near Suez, put copper rings on their tails, and threw them back in the water. A few months later, I caught a few of my specimens on the coast of Syria, still with their identification rings. That is how I demonstrated the link between the two seas.

If there was, the subterranean current must necessarily run from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, from the sole cause of difference of level. I caught a large number of fishes in the neighborhood of Suez. I passed a copper ring through their tails, and threw them back into the sea. Some months later, on the coast of Syria, I caught some of my fish ornamented with the ring. Thus the communication between the two was proved.

"J’ai dit que le cratère sous-marin rejetait des laves, mais non des flammes. Il faut aux flammes l’oxygène de l’air, et elles ne sauraient se développer sous les eaux ; mais des coulées de lave, qui ont en elles le principe de leur incandescence, peuvent se porter au rouge blanc, lutter victorieusement contre l’élément liquide et se vaporiser à son contact. De rapides courants entraînaient tous ces gaz en diffusion, et les torrents laviques glissaient jusqu’au bas de la montagne, comme les déjections du Vésuve sur un autre Torre del Greco.","I said that the submarine crater threw up lava, but not flames. Flames need the oxygen of the air, and they cannot develop under water; but flows of lava, which have in them the principle of their incandescence, can turn red-white, fight victoriously against the liquid element and vaporize on contact with it. Rapid currents carried all these gases in diffusion, and the lava torrents slid to the bottom of the mountain, like the dejecta of Vesuvius on another Torre del Greco.","I have said that the submarine crater was throwing out lava, not flames. Flames need oxygen from the air, and cannot be produced underwater; but flows of lava, which already contain their own incandescence, can be heated to white-hot, acting successfully against the liquid element and vaporizing it on contact. Quick-flowing currents carried away all the resulting half-dissolved gases as the lava torrents slid to the bottom of the mountain, like the ejecta of Vesuvius in another Torre del Greco. *","I said that the submarine crater threw up lava, but no flames. Flames require the oxygen of the air to feed upon, and cannot be developed underwater; but streams of lava, having in themselves the principles of their incandescence, can attain a white heat, fight vigorously against the liquid element, and turn it to vapor by contact. Rapid currents bearing all these gases in diffusion, and torrents of lava, slid to the bottom of the mountain like an eruption of Vesuvius on another Terra del Greco.","As I said, this underwater crater spewed lava, not flames. Flames need oxygen from the air and can't spread beneath the waves; but a lava flow has its own source of incandescence and can rise to a white heat, overpower the liquid element, and turn it into steam on contact.

To reach it, you had to go up the entire western shore of Ceylon.","With the map in front of my eyes, I looked for the Gulf of Mannar. I found it on the 9th parallel, on the north-west coast of Ceylon. It was formed by a strip of land stretching out from the little island of Mannar. To reach the bay, we needed to work our way up the western coast of Ceylon.","Soon the Nautilus returned to her native element, and the manometer showed that she was about thirty feet deep. “Well, sir,” said Captain Nemo, “you and your companions shall visit the Bank of Manaar, and if by chance some fisherman should be there, we shall see him at work.”","With the chart under my eyes, I looked for the Gulf of Mannar. I found it by the 9th parallel off the northwestern shores of Ceylon. It was formed by the long curve of little Mannar Island. To reach it we had to go all the way up Ceylon's west coast."
"« Ah ! c’est une belle mort pour un marin ! dit alors le capitaine Nemo. C’est une tranquille tombe que cette tombe de corail, et fasse le ciel que, mes compagnons et moi, nous n’en ayons jamais d’autre ! »","“Oh! It's a good death for a sailor! said Captain Nemo then. It is a tranquil grave, this coral grave, and bless heaven that my companions and I never have another! »","‘Ah, what a fine death for a sailor!’ said Captain Nemo. ‘A coral tomb provides a peaceful resting-place and may Heaven grant none other to my companions and me!’","“Ah! it is a fine death for a sailor!” said Captain Nemo, at last. “A coral tomb makes a quiet grave; and I trust that I and my comrades will find no other.”","“Ah, what a splendid way for a seaman to die!” Captain Nemo said. “A coral grave is a tranquil grave, and may Heaven grant that my companions and I lie in no other!”"

"Parmi ces ouvrages, je remarquai les chefs-d’œuvre des maîtres anciens et modernes, c’est-à-dire tout ce que l’humanité a produit de plus beau dans l’histoire, la poésie, le roman et la science, depuis Homère jusqu’à Victor Hugo, depuis Xénophon jusqu’à Michelet, depuis Rabelais jusqu’à madame Sand. Mais la science, plus particulièrement, faisait les frais de cette bibliothèque ; les livres de mécanique, de balistique. d’hydrographie, de météorologie, de géographie, de géologie, etc. , y tenaient une place non moins importante que les ouvrages d’histoire naturelle, et je compris qu’ils formaient la principale étude du capitaine. Je vis là tout le Humboldt, tout l’Arago, les travaux de Foucault, d’Henry Sainte-Claire Deville, de Chasles, de Milne-Edwards, de Quatrefages, de Tyndall, de Faraday, de Berthelot, de l’abbé Secchi, de Petermann, du commandant Maury, d’Agassis etc. Les mémoires de l’Académie des sciences, les bulletins des diverses sociétés de géographie, etc. , et, en bon rang, les deux volumes qui m’avaient peut-être valu cet accueil relativement charitable du capitaine Nemo. Parmi les œuvres de Joseph Bertrand, son livre intitulé les Fondateurs de l’Astronomie me donna même une date certaine ; et comme je savais qu’il avait paru dans le courant de 1865, je pus en conclure que l’installation du Nautilus ne remontait pas à une époque postérieure. Ainsi donc, depuis trois ans, au plus, le capitaine Nemo avait commencé son existence sous-marine. J’espérai, d’ailleurs, que des ouvrages plus récents encore me permettraient de fixer exactement cette époque ; mais j’avais le temps de faire cette recherche, et je ne voulus pas retarder davantage notre promenade à travers les merveilles du Nautilus.","Among these works, I noticed the masterpieces of the ancient and modern masters, that is to say, all that humanity has produced of the finest in history, poetry, the novel and science, from Homer to Victor Hugo, from Xenophon to Michelet, from Rabelais to Madame Sand. But science, more particularly, bore the brunt of this library; books on mechanics, ballistics. hydrography, meteorology, geography, geology, etc. , held a place there no less important than the works of natural history, and I understood that they formed the principal study of the captain. I saw there all of Humboldt, all of Arago, the works of Foucault, Henry Sainte-Claire Deville, Chasles, Milne-Edwards, Quatrefages, Tyndall, Faraday, Berthelot, Abbé Secchi , of Petermann, of Commander Maury, of Agassis, etc. The memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, the bulletins of the various geographical societies, etc. , and, in good standing, the two volumes which had perhaps won me this relatively charitable welcome from Captain Nemo. Among the works of Joseph Bertrand, his book entitled the Founders of Astronomy even gave me a certain date; and as I knew that it had appeared sometime in 1865, I was able to conclude that the installation of the Nautilus did not date back to a later period. Thus, for three years at most, Captain Nemo had begun his underwater existence. I hoped, moreover, that still more recent works would enable me to fix this period exactly; but I had time to do this research, and I did not want to delay our walk through the wonders of the Nautilus any longer.","Amongst the works, I noticed the masterpieces of the great modern and ancient artists, comprising everything that humanity has produced of greatest beauty in history, poetry, the novel, and science: from Homer to Victor Hugo, from Xenophon to Michelet, from Rabelais to Mme Sand. * But the focus of the library was more on science; books on mechanics, ballistics, hydrography, meteorology, geography, geology, etc. took up at least as much space as works on natural history, making me realize that they must form the captain’s principal study. I saw there all of Humboldt and Arago, the works of Foucault, Henri Sainte-Claire Deville, Chasles, Milne-Edwards, Quatrefages, Tyndall, Faraday, Berthelot, Father Secchi, Petermann, Commander Maury, Agassiz,* etc., the reports of the Academy of Sciences, the bulletins of the various geographical societies, etc., and, in a prominent position, the two volumes which were perhaps the reason why Captain Nemo had given me a relatively warm welcome. Amongst the books of Joseph Bertrand, Les Fondateurs de l’astronomie* even gave me a definite date: as I knew that it was published in 1865, I was able to conclude that the fitting out of the Nautilus did not date from after that. * Captain Nemo had accordingly begun his underwater existence not more than three years previously. I hoped, moreover, that still newer works would let me determine the date even more closely; but I had plenty of time to carry out such research, and did not wish to hold up the tour of the Nautilus’s wonders.","Strange to say, all these books were irregularly arranged, in whatever language they were written; and this medley proved that the captain of the Nautilus must have read indiscriminately the books which he took up by chance.ag","Among these books I noted masterpieces by the greats of ancient and modern times, in other words, all of mankind's finest achievements in history, poetry, fiction, and science, from Homer to Victor Hugo, from Xenophon to Michelet, from Rabelais to Madame George Sand. But science especially predominated in this library: books on mechanics, ballistics, hydrography, meteorology, geography, geology, etc., took up as much space as works on natural history, and I realized they were the captain's main interests. There I saw the complete works of Hum-boldt, all of Arago, and works by Foucault, Henri Sainte-Claire Deville, Chasles, Milne-Edwards, de Quatrefages, John Tyndall, Faraday, Berthelot, Father Secchi, Petermann, Commander Maury, Louis Agassiz, etc., as well as the transactions of France's Academy of Sciences, bulletins from the various geographical societies, etc., and in a prime location, those two volumes on the great ocean depths that maybe had earned me this comparatively warm welcome from Captain Nemo. Among the works of Joseph Bertrand, his book entitled The Founders of Modern Astronomy even gave me a definite date; and because I knew it had appeared in the course of 1865 , I concluded that the Nautilus hadn't been fitted out before then. Hence Captain Nemo had begun his underwater existence three years ago at the most. Moreover I hoped some even more recent books would let me pinpoint the date exactly; but I had plenty of time to look for them and I didn't want to put off any longer our stroll through the Nautilus's wonders."

"Pendant un quart d’heure, je foulai ce sable ardent, semé d’une impalpable poussière de coquillages. La coque du Nautilus, dessinée comme un long écueil, disparaissait peu à peu, mais son fanal, lorsque la nuit se serait faite au milieu des eaux, devait faciliter notre retour à bord, en projetant ses rayons avec une netteté parfaite. Effet difficile à comprendre pour qui n’a vu que sur terre ces nappes blanchâtres si vivement accusées.

"Partout dans les grands centres, le monstre devint à la mode ; on le chanta dans les cafés, on le bafoua dans les journaux, on le joua sur les théâtres. Les canards eurent là une belle occasion de pondre des œufs de toute couleur. On vit réapparaître dans les journaux — à court de copie — tous les êtres imaginaires et gigantesques, depuis la baleine blanche, le terrible « Moby Dick » des régions hyperboréennes, jusqu’au Kraken démesuré, dont les tentacules peuvent enlacer un bâtiment de cinq cents tonneaux et l’entraîner dans les abîmes de l’Océan. On reproduisit même les procès-verbaux des temps anciens les opinions d’Aristote et de Pline, qui admettaient l’existence de ces monstres, puis les récits norvégiens de l’évêque Pontoppidan, les relations de Paul Heggede, et enfin les rapports de M. Harrington, dont la bonne foi ne peut être soupçonnée, quand il affirme avoir vu, étant à bord du Castillan, en 1857, cet énorme serpent qui n’avait jamais fréquenté jusqu’alors que les mers de l’ancien Constitutionnel.","Everywhere in the great centers the monster became fashionable; it was sung in the cafes, it was scoffed at in the newspapers, it was played in the theatres. The ducks had a great opportunity to lay eggs of all colors. We see reappearing in the newspapers - short of copy - all the imaginary and gigantic beings, from the white whale, the terrible ""Moby Dick"" of the hyperborean regions, to the disproportionate Kraken, whose tentacles can embrace a building of five hundred barrels and drag it into the depths of the ocean. They even reproduced the records of ancient times, the opinions of Aristotle and Pliny, who admitted the existence of these monsters, then the Norwegian accounts of Bishop Pontoppidan, the relations of Paul Heggede, and finally the reports of Mme. Harrington, whose good faith cannot be suspected, when he affirms having seen, while on board the Castillan, in 1857, this enormous snake which had never frequented until then except the seas of the former Constitutionnel.","The monster came into fashion in all the big cities: it was sung about in the cafés, made fun of in the newspapers, acted out in the theatres.

Each gigantic imaginary creature resurfaced in the newspapers, admittedly short of good copy, from the white whale, that awe-inspiring ‘Moby Dick’ of the polar regions, to the enormous kraken,* whose tentacles can strangle a 500 ton ship and drag it down into the depths. The formally attested reports of olden times were even reproduced, the views of Aristotle and Pliny conceding the existence of such monsters, the Norwegian tales of Bishop Pontoppidan, and the account of Paul Egede. * So, lastly, were the reports of Captain Harrington, whose good faith could not be questioned when in 1857 he declared that, while on board the Castilian, he had seen that enormous serpent which until then had frequented the seas only in the pages of the old Constitutionnel. *","In every place of great resort the monster was the fashion. They sang of it in the cafés, ridiculed it in the papers, and represented it on the stage. All kinds of stories were circulated regarding it. There appeared in the papers caricatures of every gigantic and imaginary creature, from the white whale, the terrible “Moby Dick”3 of hyperborean regions, to the immense krakene whose tentacles could entangle a ship of five hundred tons, and hurry it into the abyss of the ocean. The legends of ancient times were even resuscitated, and the opinions of Aristotle and Pliny revived, who admitted the existence of these monsters,4 as well as the Norwegian tales of Bishop Pontoppidan, the accounts of Paul Heggede, and, last of all, the reports of Mr. Harrington (whose good faith no one could suspect), who affirmed that, being on board the Castillan, in 1857, he had seen this enormous serpent, which had never until that time frequented any other seas but those of the ancient “Constitutionnel.”f","In every big city the monster was the latest rage; they sang about it in the coffee houses, they ridiculed it in the newspapers, they dramatized it in the theaters. The tabloids found it a fine opportunity for chasing wild geese. Since news editors are always short of copy, you saw the reappearance of every gigantic imaginary creature within memory, from “Moby Dick,” the dreadful white whale of the High Arctic regions, to the stupendous kraken whose tentacles could entwine a 550-ton craft and drag it down into the ocean depths. They even reprinted statements from ancient times: the views of Aristotle and Pliny accepting the existence of such monsters, then the Norwegian narratives of Bishop Pontoppidan, the descriptions of Paul Egede, and finally the reports of Captain Harrington—whose good faith is above suspicion—in which he claims he saw, while aboard the Castilian in 1857, one of those enormous serpents that till then had frequented only the seas of France's old extremist newspaper, the Constitutionalist."

"Pendant les premiers mois de l’année 1867, la question parut être enterrée, et elle ne semblait pas devoir renaître, quand de nouveaux faits furent portés à la connaissance du public.

The monster again became an island, a rock, a reef, but a fleeing reef, indeterminable, elusive.","In the first few months of 1867 the question did indeed seem dead and buried, without hope of rising from the ashes, when fresh information reached the general public. There was now in fact a genuine and serious danger to circumvent, rather than simply a scientific question to resolve. The problem took on a different complexion. The monster became an islet, a rock, a reef once more; but a reef that was shifting, elusive, and slippery.","During the first months of the year 1867, the question seemed buried never to revive, when new facts were brought before the public. It was then no longer a scientific problem to be solved, but a real danger seriously to be avoided. The question took quite another shape. The monster became a small island, a rock, a reef, but a reef of indefinite and shifting proportions.","During the first months of the year 1867, the whole matter seemed to be dead and buried—and it didn't seem due for resurrection—when new facts came to the public's attention. It was no longer an issue of a scientific problem to be solved, but of a real and serious danger to be avoided. The matter took a completely new turn. Once again the monster became an islet, rock, or reef, but a runaway reef, shifty and hard to pin down."

"Pour mon compte, je n’étais pas en reste avec les autres, et je ne laissais à personne ma part d’observations quotidiennes. La frégate aurait eu cent fois raison de s’appeler l’Argus.

"Les indigènes étaient toujours là, plus nombreux que la veille – cinq ou six cents peut-être. Quelques-uns, profitant de la marée basse, s’étaient avancés sur les têtes de coraux, à moins de deux encablures du Nautilus. Je les distinguai facilement. C’étaient bien de véritables Papouas, à taille athlétique, hommes de belle race, au front large et élevé, au nez gros mais non épaté, aux dents blanches. Leur chevelure laineuse, teinte en rouge, tranchait sur un corps, noir et luisant comme celui des Nubiens. Au lobe de leur oreille, coupé et distendu, pendaient des chapelets en os. Ces sauvages étaient généralement nus. Parmi eux, je remarquai quelques femmes, habillées, des hanches au genou, d’une véritable crinoline d’herbes que soutenait une ceinture végétale. Certains chefs avaient orné leur cou d’un croissant et de colliers de verroteries rouges et blanches. Presque tous, armés d’arcs, de flèches et de boucliers, portaient à leur épaule une sorte de filet contenant ces pierres arrondies que leur fronde lance avec adresse.","The natives were still there, more numerous than the day before—five or six hundred perhaps. Some, taking advantage of the low tide, had advanced on the heads of coral, less than two cables from the Nautilus. I easily distinguished them. They were real Papuans, athletic build, handsome men, with broad and high foreheads, large but not flat noses, and white teeth. Their woolly hair, dyed red, stood out against a body, black and shiny like that of the Nubians. From the lobe of their ear, cut and distended, hung bone rosaries. These savages were generally naked. Among them, I noticed a few women, dressed from the hips to the knee in a real grass crinoline supported by a vegetable belt. Some chiefs had adorned their necks with a crescent and necklaces of red and white beads. Almost all of them, armed with bows, arrows and shields, carried on their shoulders a kind of net containing these rounded stones which their slings skillfully hurl.","The natives were still there, but more than the day before — perhaps five or six hundred. Some of them had taken advantage of the low tide to come forward on the coral heads to very near the Nautilus. I could easily make them out. They were true Papuans, men of athletic build and fine stock, with broad high foreheads, large noses, not flattened, and white teeth. Their woolly hair, dyed red, contrasted with their bodies, as black and shiny as Nubians’. Their earlobes were cut and stretched, with bone beads hanging from them. These savages were generally naked. Amongst them I noticed a few women, clothed from the haunches to the knees with real grass skirts, held up by belts made of plants. Some of the chiefs had adorned their necks with crescents and necklaces of red and white glass beads. Nearly all of them were armed with bows, arrows, and shields, and carried on their shoulders a sort of net containing those rounded stones that they throw accurately with their slings.","The natives were there, more numerous than on the day before—500 or 600 perhaps—some of them, profiting by the low water, had come on to the coral, at less than two cables’ lengths from the Nautilus. I distinguished them easily; they were true Papuans, with athletic figures; men of good race, large high foreheads—large, but not broad, and flat—and white teeth. Their woolly hair, with a reddish tinge, showed off on their black, shining bodies like those of the Nubians. From the lobes of their ears, cut and distended, hung chaplets of bones. Most of these savages were naked. Among them I remarked some women dressed from the hips to the knees in quite a crinoline of herbs, that sustained a vegetable waistband. Some chiefs had ornamented their necks with a crescent and collars of glass beads, red and white; nearly all were armed with bows, arrows, and shields, and carried on their shoulders a sort of net containing those round stones which they cast from their slings with great skill.","The islanders were still there, in greater numbers than on the day before, maybe 500 or 600 of them. Taking advantage of the low tide, some of them had moved forward over the heads of coral to less than a quarter of a mile from the Nautilus. I could easily make them out. They clearly were true Papuans, men of fine stock, their builds athletic, foreheads high and broad, noses large but not flat, teeth white. Their woolly, red-tinted hair contrasted sharply with their bodies, which were as black and glistening as a Nubian's. Strings of beads made from bone dangled under their sliced, lengthened earlobes. Generally these savages were naked. I noted some women among them, clothed from hip to knee in grass skirts held up by belts made from vegetation. Some of the chieftains adorned their necks with crescents and with necklaces made from beads of red and white glass. Armed with bows, arrows, and shields, nearly all of them carried from their shoulders a sort of net, which held those polished stones their slings hurl with such skill."
"Cependant, le Nautilus, par crainte d’échouer, s’était arrêté à trois encablures d’une grève que dominait un superbe amoncellement de roches. Le canot fut lancé à la mer.

Doubtless the Canadian did not wish to admit the presence of the South Pole.38 A few strokes of the oar brought us to the sand, where we ran ashore.","Meanwhile, to avoid running aground, the Nautilus halted about a third of a mile from the beach, over which towered magnificent piles of rocks. The skiff was put to sea. Two crewmen carrying instruments, the captain, Conseil, and I were on board. It was ten o'clock in the morning. I hadn't seen Ned Land.

"Je conduisis le Canadien à la chambre ou les hommes du Nautilus revêtaient leurs scaphandres. Je fis part au capitaine de la proposition de Ned, qui fut acceptée. Le Canadien endossa son costume de mer et fut aussitôt prêt que ses compagnons de travail. Chacun d’eux portait sur son dos l’appareil Rouquayrol auquel les réservoirs avaient fourni un large continent d’air pur. Emprunt considérable, mais nécessaire, fait à la réserve du Nautilus. Quant aux lampes Ruhmkorff, elles devenaient inutiles au milieu de ces eaux lumineuses et saturées de rayons électriques.","I led the Canadian to the room where the men of the Nautilus were putting on their diving suits. I told the captain of Ned's proposal, which was accepted. The Canadian put on his sea suit and was ready as soon as his fellow workers.

"Que d’autres échantillons merveilleux et nouveaux j’eusse encore observés, si le Nautilus ne se fût peu à peu abaissé vers les couches profondes ! Ses plans inclinés l’entraînèrent jusqu’à des fonds de deux mille et trois mille cinq cents mètres. Alors la vie animale n’était plus représentée que par des encrines, des étoiles de mer, de charmantes pentacrines tête de méduse, dont la tige droite supportait un petit calice, des troques, des quenottes sanglantes et des fissurelles, mollusques littoraux de grande espèce.","How many other marvelous and new specimens I would still have observed, if the Nautilus had not descended little by little towards the deep strata!

"Le lendemain, 12 avril, pendant la journée, le Nautilus s’approcha de la côte hollandaise, vers l’embouchure du Maroni. Là vivaient en famille plusieurs groupes de lamantins. C’étaient des manates qui, comme le dugong et le stellère, appartiennent à l’ordre des syréniens. Ces beaux animaux, paisibles et inoffensifs, longs de six à sept mètres, devaient peser au moins quatre mille kilogrammes. J’appris à Ned Land et à Conseil que la prévoyante nature avait assigné à ces mammifères un tôle important. Ce sont eux, en effet, qui, comme les phoques, doivent paître les prairies sous-marines et détruire ainsi les agglomérations d’herbes qui obstruent l’embouchure des fleuves tropicaux.","The next day, April 12, during the day, the Nautilus approached the Dutch coast, towards the mouth of the Maroni. There lived in families several groups of manatees. They were manates which, like the dugong and the steller, belong to the order of the syrenes. These beautiful animals, peaceful and harmless, six to seven meters long, must have weighed at least four thousand kilograms. I informed Ned Land and Conseil that provident nature had assigned to these mammals an important role. It is they, in fact, who, like the seals, must graze the underwater meadows and thus destroy the agglomerations of grass which obstruct the mouths of tropical rivers.","The following day, 12 April, the Nautilus approached the Dutch coast near the mouth of the Maroni. There several groups of manatees lived in families. These manatees, like the dugong and Steller’s sea cow, belong to the order of sirenians. Six or seven metres long, these fine animals, peaceful and inoffensive, must have weighed at least 4,000 kilograms. * I told Ned Land and Conseil that far-seeing nature had given such mammals an important role. Like the seals, they graze on the submarine prairies and thus destroy the accumulated grass which obstructs the mouths of tropical rivers.","The next day, April 12, the Nautilus approached the Dutch coast, near the mouth of the Maroni. There several groups of sea-cows herded together; they were manatees, that, like the dugong and the stellera, belong to the sirenian order. These beautiful animals, peaceable and inoffensive, from eighteen to twenty-one feet in length, weigh at least sixteen hundredweight. I told Ned Land and Conseil that provident nature had assigned an important rôle to these mammalia. Indeed, they, like the seals, are designed to graze on the submarine prairies, and thus destroy the accumulation of weed that obstructs the tropical rivers.","During the course of the following day, April 12, the Nautilus drew near the coast of Dutch Guiana by the mouth of the Maroni River. There several groups of sea cows were living in family units. They were manatees, which belong to the order Sirenia along with the dugong and Steller's sea cow. Harmless and unaggressive, these fine animals were around twenty to twenty-five feet long and had to have weighed nearly 4½ tons apiece. I told Ned Land and Conseil that farseeing nature had given these mammals a major role to play. In essence manatees, just like seals, are responsible for grazing on underwater prairies, destroying the clusters of weeds that clog the mouths of tropical rivers."
"En effet, le Nautilus donnait toujours la même bande sur tribord. Sans doute, il se redresserait, lorsque le bloc s’arrêterait lui-même. Mais à ce moment, qui sait si nous n’aurions pas heurté la partie supérieure de la banquise, si nous ne serions pas effroyablement pressés entre les deux surfaces glacées ?","Indeed, the Nautilus always gave the same band to starboard. No doubt he would straighten up when the block stopped itself. But at that moment, who knows if we would not have hit the upper part of the pack ice, if we would not be terribly squeezed between the two icy surfaces?","The Nautilus was indeed still listing the same amount to starboard. It would undoubtedly return to upright when the block came to a stop. But when it did, who knew if it wouldn’t be due to hitting the main body of the icefield, and being frighteningly crushed between two icy surfaces?","Indeed, the Nautilus still held the same position to starboard; doubtless it would right itself when the block stopped. But at this moment who knows if we may not strike the upper part of the iceberg, and if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces?","It was true, the Nautilus had kept the same heel to starboard. Surely it would straighten up once this frozen mass came to a halt. But before that happened, who knew if we wouldn't strike the underbelly of the ice barrier and be hideously squeezed between those two frozen surfaces?"
"Sur ce mot, le Canadien se retira, me laissant presque abasourdi. J’avais imaginé que, le cas échéant, j’aurais eu le temps de réfléchir, de discuter.

Could I now go back on my word and take responsibility for risking my companions’ futures for completely selfish reasons? Might Captain Nemo not carry us off tomorrow into the open seas far from any land?","With these words, the Canadian withdrew, leaving me almost dumb. I had imagined that, the chance gone, I should have time to reflect and discuss the matter. My obstinate companion had given me no time; and, after all, what could I have said to him? Ned Land was perfectly right. There was almost the opportunity to profit by. Could I retract my word, and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the future of my companions? To-morrow Captain Nemo might take us far from all land.","With that the Canadian turned and went, leaving me close to dumbfounded. I'd assumed that if it ever came to this, I would have time to think about it, to talk it over. My stubborn companion hadn't granted me this courtesy. But even if he had, what would I have said to him? Ned Land was right a hundred times over. These were promising circumstances, and he was making the most of them. Out of sheer selfishness could I go back on my word and be responsible for ruining the future lives of my companions? Tomorrow couldn't Captain Nemo take us far away from any land?"
"Je ne m’attendais pas à trouver le câble électrique dans son état primitif, tel qu’il était en sortant des ateliers de fabrication.

The long snake, covered with shell debris, bristling with foraminifera, was encrusted in a stony impasto which protected it against piercing molluscs. It rested quietly, sheltered from the movements of the sea, and under a pressure favorable to the transmission of the electric spark which passes from America to Europe in thirty-two hundredths of a second. The duration of this cable will undoubtedly be infinite, because it has been observed that the gutta-percha envelope improves by its stay in sea water.","I did not expect to find the electric cable in the same state as when it came out of the workshops.

It rested calmly, sheltered from the movements of the sea, at a pressure suitable for the transmission of the electric spark, which goes from America to Europe in 0.32 seconds. The life of this cable will undoubtedly be infinite, for it has been observed that its gutta-percha covering actually improves the longer it stays in salt water.","I did not expect to find the electric cable in its primitive state, such as it was on leaving the manufactory.

It lay quietly sheltered from the motions of the sea, and under a favorable pressure for the transmission of the electric spark which passes from Europe to America in 0.32 of a second. Doubtless this cable will last for a great length of time, for they find that the gutta-percha covering is improved by the sea-water.","I didn't expect to find that electric cable in pristine condition, as it looked on leaving its place of manufacture. The long snake was covered with seashell rubble and garnished with foraminifera; a crust of cakedgravel shielded it from any mollusks tempted to bore into it. It rested serenely, sheltered from the sea's movements, under a pressure conducive to the transmission of that electric spark that goes from America to Europe in 32/100 of a second. No doubt this cable will last indefinitely, because, as some have noted, a stay in salt water will actually improve its gutta-percha casing."

"Cette baie, draguée à plusieurs reprises, fournit abondamment des huîtres excellentes. Nous en mangeâmes immodérément, après les avoir ouvertes sur notre table même, suivant le précepte de Sénèque. Ces mollusques appartenaient à l’espèce connue sous le nom d’ostrea lamellosa, qui est très commune en Corse. Ce banc de Wailea devait être considérable, et certainement, sans des causes multiples de destruction, ces agglomérations finiraient par combler les baies, puisque l’on compte jusqu’à deux millions d’œufs dans un seul individu.","This bay, dredged on several occasions, provides abundantly excellent oysters. We ate them immoderately, after opening them on our own table, following Seneca's precept. These molluscs belonged to the species known as ostrea lamellosa, which is very common in Corsica. This shoal of Wailea must have been considerable, and certainly, without multiple causes of destruction, these aggregations would eventually fill up the bays, since there are as many as two million eggs in a single individual.","The bay was dredged several times, and provided us with excellent oysters in profusion. We ate immoderately, opening them at the table itself following Seneca’s precept. * These molluscs belonged to the species known as Ostrea lamellosa, very common in Corsica.

As the Roman playwright Seneca recommended, we opened them right at the table and ate way too many. These mollusks belonged to the species known by name as Ostrea lamellosa, whose members are quite common off Corsica. This Wailea oyster bed must have been substantial, and if these clusters of shellfish hadn't had so many natural enemies, they surely would have ended up jam-packing the bay, since close to 2,000,000 eggs have been counted in a single individual."
"A cela, pas de réponse possible. Je me rendis au salon après avoir déjeuné, et je me mis au travail. Jusqu’à cinq heures du soir, je rédigeai mes notes. En ce moment — devais-je l’attribuer à une disposition personnelle — je sentis une chaleur extrême, et je dus enlever mon vêtement de byssus. Effet incompréhensible, car nous n’étions pas sous de hautes latitudes, et d’ailleurs le Nautilus, immergé, ne devait éprouver aucune élévation de température. Je regardai le manomètre. Il marquait une profondeur de soixante pieds, à laquelle la chaleur atmosphérique n’aurait pu atteindre.","To that, there is no possible answer. I went to the living room after lunch and got to work. Until five o'clock in the evening, I wrote my notes. At this moment - should I attribute it to a personal disposition - I felt an extreme heat, and I had to take off my byssal garment. Incomprehensible effect, because we were not in high latitudes, and moreover the Nautilus, immersed, should not experience any rise in temperature. I looked at the manometer. It marked a depth of sixty feet, to which the atmospheric heat could not have reached.","To that, we had no answer. I went back to the salon after lunch, and set to work.

Till five o’clock in the evening, I employed myself in arranging my notes. At that moment (ought I to attribute it to some peculiar idiosyncrasy?) I felt so great a heat that I was obliged to take off my coat of byssus! It was strange, for we were not under low latitudes; and even then, the Nautilus, submerged as it was, ought to experience no change of temperature. I looked at the manometer; it showed a depth of sixty feet, to which atmospheric heat could never attain.","There was no way we could answer this. After breakfast I proceeded to the lounge and knuckled down to work. I wrote up my notes till five o'clock in the afternoon. Just then—was it because of some personal indisposition?—I felt tremendously hot and had to take off my coat made of fan mussel fabric. Which was a perplexing state of affairs, because we weren't in the low latitudes—and besides, once the Nautilus was submerged it shouldn't have been experiencing any rise in temperature. I looked at our pressure gauge. It indicated a depth of sixty feet, a depth beyond the reach of the atmosphere's heat."

"— Oui et non, monsieur Aronnax, me répondit le capitaine Nemo, qui me parut posséder à fond « sa mer Rouge ». Ce qui n’est plus dangereux pour un navire moderne, bien gréé, solidement construit, maître de sa direction grâce à l’obéissante vapeur, offrait des périls de toutes sortes aux bâtiments des anciens. Il faut se représenter ces premiers navigateurs s’aventurant sur des barques faites de planches cousues avec des cordes de palmier, calfatées de résine pilée et enduites de graisse de chiens de mer. Ils n’avaient pas même d’instruments pour relever leur direction, et ils marchaient à l’estime au milieu de courants qu’ils connaissaient à peine. Dans ces conditions, les naufrages étaient et devaient être nombreux. Mais de notre temps, les steamers qui font le service entre Suez et les mers du Sud n’ont plus rien à redouter des colères de ce golfe, en dépit des moussons contraires. Leurs capitaines et leurs passagers ne se préparent pas au départ par des sacrifices propitiatoires, et, au retour, ils ne vont plus, ornés de guirlandes et de bandelettes dorées, remercier les dieux dans le temple voisin.","""Yes and no, Monsieur Aronnax,"" answered Captain Nemo, who seemed to me to possess ""his Red Sea"" thoroughly. What is no longer dangerous for a modern ship, well rigged, solidly built, master of its direction thanks to the obedient steam, offered perils of all kinds to the vessels of the ancients. It is necessary to imagine these first navigators venturing on boats made of planks sewn with palm cords, caulked with crushed resin and coated with sea dog grease. They did not even have instruments to raise their direction, and they walked by dead reckoning in the midst of currents they hardly knew. Under these conditions, shipwrecks were and were to be numerous. But in our time, the steamers which make the service between Suez and the South Seas have nothing more to fear from the wrath of this gulf, in spite of the opposing monsoons. Their captains and their passengers do not prepare themselves for departure by propitiatory sacrifices, and, on their return, they no longer go, adorned with garlands and golden bands, to thank the gods in the neighboring temple.","‘Yes, but were their fears not exaggerated?’ ‘Yes and no,’ replied the captain, who seemed to be an expert on all aspects of ‘his’ Red Sea. ‘What no longer poses a problem for a modern ship, well rigged, solidly constructed, master of its direction thanks to obedient steam, offered all sorts of dangers to the vessels of the ancients. One must try to imagine those early navigators venturing out on boats that were made of planks held together by ropes made of palm leaves, caulked with powdered resin, and waterproofed with tallow from dogfish. They didn’t even have instruments to determine their direction, and so sailed by dead reckoning in the midst of currents they hardly knew. In those conditions, shipwrecks were necessarily common. But in our time, the steamers plying between Suez and the South Seas no longer have anything to fear from the angers of this gulf, in spite of the contrary monsoons. Their captains and passengers do not prepare for departure with propitiary sacrifices, and, once back, they no longer adorn themselves with garlands and golden strips before going to thank the gods in their neighbourhood temples.’","“It is true,” said I; “but were not their fears exaggerated?” “Yes and no, M. Aronnax,” replied Captain Nemo, who seemed to know the Red Sea by heart. “That which is no longer dangerous for a modern vessel, well rigged, strongly built, and master of its own course, thanks to obedient steam, offered all sorts of perils to the ships of the ancients. Picture to yourself those first navigators venturing in ships made of planks sewn with the cords of the palm trees, saturated with the grease of the seadog, and covered with powdered resin! They had not even instruments wherewith to take their bearings, and they went by guess among currents of which they scarcely knew anything. Under such conditions shipwrecks were, and must have been, numerous. But in our time, steamers running between Suez and the South Seas have nothing more to fear from the fury of this gulf, in spite of contrary trade winds. The captain and passengers do not prepare for their departure by offering propitiatory sacrifices; and, on their return, they no longer go ornamented with wreaths and gilt fillets to thank the gods in the neighboring temple.”","“But weren't their fears exaggerated?” “Yes and no, Professor Aronnax,” answered Captain Nemo, who seemed to know “his Red Sea” by heart. “For a modern ship, well rigged, solidly built, and in control of its course thanks to obedient steam, some conditions are no longer hazardous that offered all sorts of perils to the vessels of the ancients. Just picture those early navigators venturing out in sailboats made of planks tied together with ropes of palm leaves, caulked with powdered resin, and smeared with dogfish grease. They didn't even have any instruments for taking their bearings, so they went by guesswork in the midst of currents they barely knew. Under such conditions shipwrecks must have been commonplace. But these days steamers running between Suez and the South Seas have nothing to fear from this bad-tempered gorge, despite the contrary winds of its monsoons. Their captains and passengers no longer prepare for departure with sacrifices to appease the gods, and after coming home, they don't traipse in wreaths and gold ribbons to say thanks at the local temple.”"

"Pendant notre traversée, je vis de nombreuses baleines qui appartenaient aux trois espèces particulières aux mers australes, la baleine franche ou « right-whale » des Anglais, qui n’a pas de nageoire dorsale, le hump-back, baleinoptère à ventre plissé, aux vastes nageoires blanchâtres, qui malgré son nom, ne forment pourtant pas des ailes, et le fin-back, brun-jaunâtre, le plus vif des cétacés. Ce puissant animal se fait entendre de loin, lorsqu’il projette à une grande hauteur ses colonnes d’air et de vapeur, qui ressemblent à des tourbillons de fumée. Ces différents mammifères s’ébattaient par troupes dans les eaux tranquilles, et je vis bien que ce bassin du pôle antarctique servait maintenant de refuge aux cétacés trop vivement traqués par les chasseurs.","During our crossing, I saw many whales which belonged to the three species peculiar to the southern seas, the right whale or ""right-whale"" of the English, which has no dorsal fin, the hump-back, a whale with a pleated belly, with vast whitish fins, which despite its name, however, do not form wings, and the fin-back, yellowish-brown, the liveliest of cetaceans. This powerful animal is heard from afar, when it throws up its columns of air and vapor, which look like whirlwinds of smoke. These different mammals were frolicking in herds in the calm waters, and I clearly saw that this basin at the Antarctic pole was now serving as a refuge for cetaceans too keenly tracked by hunters.","As we headed for land, I saw a large number of whales from the three species particular to the southern seas: the right whale, as the British call it, without a dorsal fin; the humpback or rorqual, with a wrinkled stomach and huge white fins, which do not form wings despite its French name, baleinoptere; and the finback, yellowish-brown in colour and the quickest of the three. This powerful animal can make itself heard at great distances when it sends columns of air and vapour up to considerable heights, turning into misty whorls. These various mammals were playing in schools in the peaceful waters, and I realized that this basin of the South Pole now served as a refuge for the cetaceans, too fiercely hunted by mankind.","While crossing, I saw numerous whales belonging to the three kinds peculiar to the southern seas: the whale, or the English “right whale,” which has no dorsal fin; the “humpback,” or balænopteron, with reeved chest, and large whitish fins, which, in spite of its name, do not form wings; and the finback, of a yellowish-brown, the liveliest of all the cetacea. This powerful creature is heard a long way off when he throws to a great height columns of air and vapor, which look like whirlwinds of smoke. These different mammals were disporting themselves in troops in the quiet waters; and I could see that this basin of the Antarctic Pole served as a place of refuge to the cetacea too closely tracked by the hunters.","During our crossing I saw many baleen whales belonging to the three species characteristic of these southernmost seas: bowhead whales (“the right whale,” as the English say), which have no dorsal fins; humpback whales from the genus Balaenoptera (in other words, “winged whales”), beasts with pleated bellies and huge whitish pectoral fins, which, genus name nothwithstanding, haven't yet developed into wings; and finback whales, yellowish brown, the fastest of all cetaceans. These powerful animals can be heard from far away when they shoot up towering spouts of air and steam that look like swirls of smoke. Pods of these different mammals were playing in the tranquil waters, and I could easily see that this antarctic polar basin now served as a refuge for those cetaceans too relentlessly tracked by hunters."

"Je compris alors quel était le dessein du capitaine Nemo. En laissant cette perle enfouie sous le manteau de la tridacne, il lui permettait de s’accroître insensiblement. Avec chaque année la sécrétion du mollusque y ajoutait de nouvelles couches concentriques. Seul, le capitaine connaissait la grotte où « mûrissait » cet admirable fruit de la nature ; seul il l’élevait, pour ainsi dire, afin de la transporter un jour dans son précieux musée. Peut-être même, suivant l’exemple des Chinois et des Indiens, avait-il déterminé la production de cette perle en introduisant sous les plis du mollusque quelque morceau de verre et de métal, qui s’était peu à peu recouvert de la matière nacrée. En tout cas, comparant cette perle à celles que je connaissais déjà, à celles qui brillaient dans la collection du capitaine, j’estimai sa valeur à dix millions de francs au moins. Superbe curiosité naturelle et non bijou de luxe, car je ne sais quelles oreilles féminines auraient pu la supporter.","I understood then what Captain Nemo's intention was. By leaving this pearl buried under the coat of the tridacne, he allowed it to grow imperceptibly. With each year the secretion of the mollusk added new concentric layers to it. Only the captain knew the cave where this wonderful fruit of nature ""ripened""; he alone raised her, so to speak, in order to transport her one day to his precious museum. Perhaps, following the example of the Chinese and the Indians, he had determined the production of this pearl by introducing under the folds of the mollusk some piece of glass and metal, which was gradually covered with the material. pearly. In any case, comparing this pearl with those I already knew, with those which shone in the captain's collection, I estimated its value at ten million francs at least. Superb natural curiosity and not a luxury jewel, because I do not know what female ears could have supported it.","I then understood Captain Nemo’s purpose. By leaving the pearl entombed in the Tridacna’s protection, he allowed it to grow imperceptibly. With each year the mollusc’s secretion added new concentric rings. The captain alone knew of the grotto where this admirable fruit of nature was ‘ripening’; he alone was raising it, so to speak, in order to enrich his inestimable museum one day. Perhaps, after the fashion of the Chinese and Indians, he had even brought the pearl into being by placing a piece of glass or metal in the folds of the mollusc, which by degrees the nacreous substance covered. In any case, comparing this pearl to those I already knew, and to those which gleamed in the captain’s collection, I estimated its value to be at least ten million francs. It was more a magnificent natural curiosity than a luxurious jewel, for I am unaware of any ladies’ ears capable of bearing it.","I then understood Captain Nemo’s intention. In leaving this pearl hidden in the mantle of the tridacne, he was allowing it to grow slowly.","I realized what Captain Nemo's objective was. By leaving the pearl buried beneath the giant clam's mantle, he allowed it to grow gradually. With each year that went by, the mollusk's secretions added new concentric layers. The captain alone knew about the cave where this wonderful fruit of nature was “ripening”; he alone was rearing it, so to speak, in order to transfer it one day to his beloved museum. Maybe, following the examples of oyster farmers in China and India, he'd even predetermined the creation of this pearl by sticking some piece of glass or metal under the mollusk's folds, where it was gradually covered with mother-of-pearl. In any event, comparing this pearl to others I'd heard of and to those gleaming in the captain's collection, I estimated it was worth at least $2,000,000. It was a marvelous natural curiosity rather than a luxurious jewel, because I don't know of any woman with an ear that could handle it."

Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length—we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the ichthyologistsb of the day, if it existed at all.","As entered in various logbooks, the relevant data on this apparition agreed pretty closely as to the makeup of the object or creature in question, the record setting speed of its movements, its startling ability to get from one location to another, and the unique energy it seemed to enjoy.

"« Quant aux infusoires, reprit-il, quant à ces milliards d’animalcules, qui existent par millions dans une gouttelette, et dont il faut huit cent mille pour peser un milligramme, leur rôle n’est pas moins important. Ils absorbent les sels marins, ils s’assimilent les éléments solides de l’eau, et, véritables faiseurs de continents calcaires, ils fabriquent des coraux et des madrépores ! Et alors la goutte d’eau, privée de son aliment minéral, s’allège, remonte à la surface, y absorbe les sels abandonnés par l’évaporation, s’alourdit, redescend, et rapporte aux animalcules de nouveaux éléments à absorber. De là, un double courant ascendant et descendant, et toujours le mouvement, toujours la vie ! La vie, plus intense que sur les continents, plus exubérante, plus infinie, s’épanouissant dans toutes les parties de cet océan, élément de mort pour l’homme, a-t-on dit, élément de vie pour des myriades d’animaux et pour moi ! »","“As for the infusoria,” he went on, “as for those billions of animalcules, which exist by millions in a droplet, and of which it takes eight hundred thousand to weigh a milligram, their role is no less important. They absorb sea salts, they assimilate the solid elements of water, and, true makers of limestone continents, they make corals and madrepores! And then the drop of water, deprived of its mineral food, becomes lighter, rises to the surface, absorbs there the salts abandoned by evaporation, becomes heavier, comes down again, and brings back to the animalcules new elements to absorb. From there, a double ascending and descending current, and always the movement, always the life! Life, more intense than on the continents, more exuberant, more infinite, flourishing in all parts of this ocean, element of death for man, it has been said, element of life for myriads of animals and for me! »","‘As for the infusoria,’ he continued, ‘those billions of animalculae, their role is no less important. The tiniest drop contains millions of them, and eight hundred thousand are required to make one milligram.

And then the drop of water, deprived of its mineral sustenance, becomes lighter, rises to the surface, absorbs salts left there by evaporation, grows heavier, descends again, and brings back down new material for the animalculae to absorb. Hence a double current, rising and falling, and constant movement, continuous life! Life more intense than on land, more exuberant, more immeasurable, blossoming in every part of the ocean, a deadly habitat for man, it has been said, a life-giving element for the myriads of animals — and for me!’","“Yes, the ocean has indeed circulation, and to promote it, the Creator has caused things to multiply in it—caloric, salt, and animalculæ.” ao","“As for those billions of tiny animals,” he went on, “those infusoria that live by the millions in one droplet of water, twenty billion of which weigh barely an ounce, their role is equally important. They consume the salt in the sea, they assimilate the solid elements in the water, and since they produce coral and madrepores, they're the actual creators of limestone continents! And then, once they've deprived our water drop of its mineral nutrients, the droplet gets lighter, rises to the surface , there consumes more salt left behind through evaporation, gets heavier, sinks again, and brings those tiny animals new elements to consume. Ergo these two currents, rising and falling, continually moving, continually alive! More intense than on land, more plentiful, more infinite, this energy flourishes in every part of this ocean, a fatal element for man, it's said, but a vital element for myriads of creatures—and for me!”"

"— Rien n’est jamais terminé dans les parages volcaniques, répondit le capitaine Nemo, et le globe y est toujours travaillé par les feux souterrains. Déjà, en l’an dix-neuf de notre ère, suivant Cassiodore et Pline, une île nouvelle, Théia la divine, apparut à la place même où se sont récemment formés ces îlots. Puis, elle s’abîma sous les flots, pour se remontrer en l’an soixante-neuf et s’abîmer encore une fois. Depuis cette époque jusqu’à nos jours, le travail plutonien fut suspendu. Mais, le 3 février 1866, un nouvel îlot, qu’on nomma l’îlot de George, émergea au milieu des vapeurs sulfureuses, près de Néa-Kamenni, et s’y souda, le 6 du même mois. Sept jours après, le 13 février, l’îlot Aphrœssa parut, laissant entre Néa-Kamenni et lui un canal de dix mètres. J’étais dans ces mers quand le phénomène se produisit, et j’ai pu en observer toutes les phases. L’îlot Aphrœssa, de forme arrondie, mesurait trois cents pieds de diamètre sur trente pieds de hauteur. Il se composait de laves noires et vitreuses, mêlées de fragments feldspathiques. Enfin, le 10 mars, un îlot plus petit, appelé Réka, se montra près de Néa-Kamenni, et depuis lors, ces trois îlots, soudés ensemble, ne forment plus qu’une seule et même île.","""Nothing is ever finished in the volcanic regions,"" replied Captain Nemo, ""and the globe is always worked there by subterranean fires. Already, in the year nineteen of our era, following Cassiodorus and Pliny, a new island, Theia the divine, appeared on the very spot where these islets had recently formed. Then, it sank under the waves, to reappear in the year sixty-nine and sink once more. From that time to the present, the Plutonian work was suspended. But, on February 3, 1866, a new islet, which was called George's islet, emerged in the midst of sulphurous vapours, near Néa-Kamenni, and welded itself there on the 6th of the same month. Seven days later, on February 13, the islet Aphroessa appeared, leaving between Néa-Kamenni and it a channel of ten meters. I was in these seas when the phenomenon occurred, and I was able to observe all its phases. The islet Aphroessa, rounded in shape, measured three hundred feet in diameter by thirty feet in height. It was composed of black and glassy lava, mixed with feldspathic fragments. Finally, on March 10, a smaller islet, called Réka, appeared near Néa-Kamenni, and since then, these three islets, welded together, form only one and the same island.","‘Nothing is ever finished in the vicinity of volcanoes,’ he replied, ‘and the globe is still worked by underground fires. According to Cassiodorus* and Pliny, as early as the year 19 of our era a new island, Thira the divine, appeared on the same spot where these small islands were recently formed. Then it disappeared under the waves, to appear again in 69, only to plunge down once more. From then until the modern era, the plutonic work ceased. But on 3 February 1866 a new piece of land, which was named George Island, emerged in the midst of sulphurous vapours near Nea Kameni and united with it on 6 February. A week later, on the 13th, Aphroessa Island appeared, leaving a channel of 10 metres between it and Nea Kameni. I was in these seas when it happened, and could observe each of the phases. Aphroessa Island measured 300 feet across by 30 feet high. It was composed of black vitreous lavas mixed with feldspathic fragments. Finally, on 10 March a small island called Reka appeared* near Nea Kameni, and since then these three little pieces of land have joined together, and now form a single island.’","“Nothing is ever ended in the volcanic parts of the sea,” replied Captain Nemo; “and the globe is always being worked by subterranean fires. Already, in the nineteenth year of our era, according to Cassiodorus and Pliny, a new island, Theia (the divine), appeared in the very place where these islets have recently been formed. Then they sank under the waves, to rise again in the year 69, when they again subsided. Since that time to our days, the Plutonian work has been suspended. But, on the 3d of February, 1866, a new island, which they named George Island, emerged from the midst of the sulphurous vapor near Nea Kamenni, and settled again the 6th of the same month. Seven days after, the 13th of February, the island of Aphroessa appeared, leaving between Nea Kamenni and itself a canal ten yards broad. I was in these seas when the phenomenon occurred, and I was able therefore to observe all the different phases. The island of Aphroessa, of round form, measured 300 feet in diameter, and thirty feet in height. It was composed of black and vitreous lava, mixed with fragments of felspar. And lastly, on the 10th of March, a smaller island, called Reka, showed itself near Nea Kamenni, and since then these three have joined together, forming but one and the same island.”","“Nothing is ever finished in the waterways near a volcano,” Captain Nemo replied, “and thanks to its underground fires, our planet is continually under construction in these regions. According to the Latin historians Cassiodorus and Pliny, by the year 19 of the Christian era, a new island, the divine Thera, had already appeared in the same place these islets have formed more recently. Then Thera sank under the waves, only to rise and sink once more in the year 69 A.D. From that day to this, such volcanic construction work has been in abeyance. But on February 3, 1866, a new islet named George Island emerged in the midst of sulfurous smoke near Nea Kameni and was fused to it on the 6th of the same month. Seven days later, on February 13, the islet of Aphroessa appeared, leaving a thirty-foot channel between itself and Nea Kameni. I was in these seas when that phenomenon occurred and I was able to study all its phases. The islet of Aphroessa was circular in shape and measured 300 feet across by thirty feet high. It was composed of black, glassy lava mixed with bits of feldspar. Finally, on March 10, a smaller islet named Reka appeared next to Nea Kameni, and since then these three islets have fused to form one whole island.”"

I don't know if Conseil was busy with their classification, but as for me, I looked at their silver bellies and their fearsome, teeth-studded mouths from a viewpoint not exactly scientific—more as a food item than as a naturalist."

"Pendant quelques jours, nous vîmes une grande quantité d’oiseaux aquatiques, palmipèdes, mouettes ou goélands. Quelques-uns furent adroitement tués, et, préparés d’une certaine façon, ils fournirent un gibier d’eau très acceptable. Parmi les grands voiliers, emportés à de longues distances de toutes terres, et qui se reposent sur les flots des fatigues du vol, j’aperçus de magnifiques albatros au cri discordant comme un braiement d’âne, oiseaux qui appartiennent à la famille des longipennes. La famille des totipalmes était représentée par des frégates rapides qui pêchaient prestement les poissons de la surface, et par de nombreux phaétons ou paille-en-queue, entre autres, ce phaéton à brins rouges, gros comme un pigeon, et dont le plumage blanc est nuancé de tons roses qui font valoir la teinte noire des ailes.","For a few days, we saw a large number of aquatic birds, waterfowl, seagulls or gulls. Some were skilfully killed, and, prepared in a certain way, they provided very acceptable waterfowl. Among the tall ships, carried long distances from all lands, and resting on the waves from the fatigue of flight, I saw magnificent albatrosses with a discordant cry like the braying of a donkey, birds which belong to the family of longipennes. . The family of totipalms was represented by fast frigates which quickly fished up fish from the surface, and by numerous tropicbirds or straw-tailed tropicbirds, among others, this red-tailed tropicbird, as big as a pigeon, and whose white plumage is nuanced with pink tones that emphasize the black tint of the wings.","For a few days we saw many aquatic birds, palmipeds and seagulls of various sorts.

The representatives of the family of totipalmates included swift frigate birds which fished deftly on the surface, and large numbers of boatswain birds or tropic-birds, including ones that were as large as pigeons, with red ribbing and white plumage shaded in varieties of pink, bringing out the black of their wings.","For some days we saw a great number of aquatic birds, sea-mews or gulls.

Some were skillfully slain, and when cooked a certain way, they're a perfectly acceptable platter of water game.

Le corail se vend jusqu’à cinq cents francs le kilogramme, et en cet endroit, les couches liquides recouvraient la fortune de tout un monde de corailleurs.

"Cependant, une vingtaine de matelots du Nautilus, tous gens vigoureux et bien constitues, étaient montés sur la plate-forme. Ils venaient retirer les filets qui avaient été mis à la traîne pendant la nuit. Ces marins appartenaient évidemment à des nations différentes, bien que le type européen fût indiqué chez tous. Je reconnus, à ne pas me tromper, des Irlandais, des Français, quelques Slaves, un Grec ou un Candiote.

Even so, these men were frugal of speech and among themselves used only that peculiar dialect whose origin I couldn't even guess. Accordingly I had to give up any notions of questioning them."
"Donc, ce jour-là, le canot ne quitta pas le bord, au grand déplaisir de maître Land qui ne put compléter ses provisions. Cet adroit Canadien employa son temps à préparer les viandes et farines qu’il avait rapportées de l’île Gueboroar. Quant aux sauvages, ils regagnèrent la terre vers onze heures du matin, dès que les têtes de corail commencèrent à disparaître sous le flot de la marée montante.

I had not, however, noticed a single native dugout.","So that, on that day, the boat did not push off, to the great displeasure of Master Land, who could not complete his provisions.

"Le 27 janvier, à l’ouvert du vaste golfe du Bengale, nous rencontrâmes à plusieurs reprises, spectacle sinistre ! des cadavres qui flottaient à la surface des flots.

"Puis, au moment où il se disposait à frapper, le cétacé se dérobait avec une rapidité que je ne puis estimer à moins de trente milles à l’heure.

"A cet ordre, qui fut transmis à la machine au moyen d’appareils à air comprimé, les mécaniciens firent agir la roue de la mise en train.

"— Oui, car ces pauvres pêcheurs ne peuvent demeurer longtemps sous l’eau. L’Anglais Perceval, dans son voyage à Ceylan, parle bien d’un Cafre qui restait cinq minutes sans remonter à la surface, mais le fait me paraît peu croyable. Je sais que quelques plongeurs vont jusqu’à cinquante-sept secondes, et de très habiles jusqu’à quatre-vingt-sept ; toutefois ils sont rares, et, revenus à bord, ces malheureux rendent par le nez et les oreilles de l’eau teintée de sang. Je crois que la moyenne de temps que les pêcheurs peuvent supporter est de trente secondes, pendant lesquelles ils se hâtent d’entasser dans un petit filet toutes les huîtres perlières qu’ils arrachent ; mais, généralement, ces pêcheurs ne vivent pas vieux ; leur vue s’affaiblit ; des ulcérations se déclarent à leurs yeux ; des plaies se forment sur leur corps, et souvent même ils sont frappés d’apoplexie au fond de la mer.","“Yes, for these poor fishermen cannot stay long under water. The Englishman Perceval, in his trip to Ceylon, speaks well of a Cafre who remained five minutes without rising to the surface, but the fact seems to me unbelievable. I know that some divers go up to fifty-seven seconds, and very good ones up to eighty-seven; however, they are rare, and when they get back on board, these unfortunates give out water tinged with blood through their noses and ears. I believe that the average time that fishermen can endure is thirty seconds, during which they hasten to pile up in a small net all the pearl oysters they snatch; but, generally, these fishermen do not live old; their eyesight fails; ulcerations break out in their eyes; wounds form on their bodies, and often they are even struck with apoplexy at the bottom of the sea.","‘Indeed, since the poor divers cannot remain underwater for long. The Briton Percival,* in his journey to Ceylon, speaks of a “Kaffir” who spent five minutes without coming back up. But this appears hardly credible to me. I know that some divers can stay as much as 57 seconds and very good ones, 87; * however, these are rare, and when these unfortunates come back on board, their noses and ears are dripping water tinted with blood. I believe that on average the divers can manage thirty seconds, during which they rush to cram into a little net all the pearl oysters they can tear off; but generally these divers do not live to a ripe old age: their sight diminishes; ulcerations break out on their eyes; sores form on their bodies; and often they have strokes at the bottom of the sea.’","“Well, sir,” said Captain Nemo, “you and your companions shall visit the Bank of Manaar, and if by chance some fisherman should be there, we shall see him at work.”","“Yes, since those poor fishermen can't stay very long underwater. In writing about his trip to Ceylon, the Englishman Percival speaks highly of a Kaffir who stayed under five minutes before coming back to the surface, but I find this feat hard to believe. I know that some divers can last as long as fifty-seven seconds and very skillful ones as long as eighty-seven; but such men are rare, and when the poor fellows climb back on board, the water dripping out of their noses and ears is stained with blood. I believe the average time underwater that these fishermen can tolerate is thirty seconds, during which they hurriedly stuff their little nets with all the pearl oysters they can tear loose. But these fishermen generally don't live into ripe old age; their vision weakens, ulcers break out on their eyes, sores form on their bodies, and some of them even have strokes on the ocean floor.”"

Ils se chargèrent d’eau, et toute la chaleur électrique des piles fut lancée à travers les serpentins baignés par le liquide. En quelques minutes, cette eau avait atteint cent degrés. Elle fut dirigée vers les pompes pendant qu’une eau nouvelle la remplaçait au fur et à mesure. La chaleur développée par les piles était telle que l’eau froide, puisée à la mer, après avoir seulement traversé les appareils, arrivait bouillante aux corps de pompe.","The thermometer then marked minus seven degrees outside. Captain Nemo led me to the kitchens where vast distilling apparatus operated which supplied drinking water by evaporation. They charged with water, and all the electrical heat from the batteries was sent through the coils bathed in the liquid. In a few minutes, this water had reached one hundred degrees. She was directed to the pumps while new water gradually replaced her. The heat developed by the batteries was such that the cold water, drawn from the sea, after having only passed through the apparatus, reached the pump bodies boiling hot.","The temperature outside read −7°. Captain Nemo took me to the kitchens, where vast distillation machinery produced drinking water by means of evaporation. It was now filled with water, then all the energy from the electric batteries was sent through the liquid in the coils. In a few minutes the water reached 100°. While it was sent to the pumps, an equivalent amount of fresh water was introduced. The heat developed by the batteries was such that, merely by going through this equipment, cold water drawn from the sea arrived boiling at the pumping machinery.","The thermometer then stood at seven degrees outside. Captain Nemo took me to the galleys, where the vast distillatory machines stood that furnished the drinkable water by evaporation. They filled these with water, and all the electric heat from the piles was thrown through the worms bathed in the liquid. In a few minutes this water reached a hundred degrees. It was directed toward the pumps, while fresh water replaced it in proportion. The heat developed by the troughs was such that cold water, drawn up from the sea, after only having gone through the machines, came boiling into the body of the pump.","At this point our thermometer gave 19° Fahrenheit outside. Captain Nemo led me to the galley where a huge distilling mechanism was at work, supplying drinking water through an evaporation process. We loaded the mechanism with water and threw the full electric heat of our batteries into coils passing through the liquid. In a few minutes the water reached its boiling point of 212° Fahrenheit. It went off to the pumps while new water replaced it in the meantime. The heat generated by our batteries was so intense that after simply going through the mechanism, water drawn cold from the sea arrived boiling hot at the brigade of pumps."
"Je n’avais pas encore eu le temps de comprendre pourquoi le capitaine me faisait cette recommandation, quand je fus précipité sur le tapis.","I had not yet had time to understand why the captain was giving me this recommendation, when I was thrown onto the mat.","Before I had had time to understand why the captain had given me this advice, I was thrown on to the carpet.","I had not time to understand why the captain cautioned me thus, when I was thrown forward on to the carpet.","Before I had time to understand why the captain made this recommendation, I was hurled to the carpet."
"Quel indescriptible spectacle ! Ah ! que ne pouvions-nous communiquer nos sensations ! Pourquoi étions-nous emprisonnés sous ce masque de métal et de verre !

"Je travaillai dans ma chambre jusqu’à midi, sans avoir vu, même un instant, le capitaine Nemo. On ne paraissait faire à bord aucun préparatif de départ.","I worked in my room until noon, without having seen Captain Nemo even for a moment. No preparation for departure seemed to be made on board.",I worked in my room until midday but without seeing Captain Nemo for a single moment. Apparently no preparations for leaving were being made on board.,"I worked in my room till noon, without having seen Captain Nemo, even for an instant.

Nobody on board seemed to be making any preparations for departure.
"Il était alors cinq heures du matin. En ce moment, un choc se produisit à l’avant du Nautilus. Je compris que son éperon venait de heurter un bloc de glace. Ce devait être une fausse manœuvre, car ce tunnel sous-marin, obstrué de blocs, n’offrait pas une navigation facile. Je pensai donc que le capitaine Nemo, modifiant sa route, tournerait ces obstacles ou suivrait les sinuosités du tunnel. En tout cas, la marche en avant ne pouvait être absolument enrayée. Toutefois, contre mon attente, le Nautilus prit un mouvement rétrograde très prononcé.","It was then five o'clock in the morning. At this moment, a shock occurred in front of the Nautilus. I realized that his spur had just hit a block of ice. It must have been a mistake, because this underwater tunnel, clogged with blocks, did not offer easy navigation. I therefore thought that Captain Nemo, modifying his course, would turn these obstacles or follow the sinuosities of the tunnel. In any case, the forward march could not be absolutely checked. However, against my expectation, the Nautilus took a very pronounced retrograde motion.","It was five in the morning. Just then, a jolt reverberated from the front of the Nautilus. I understood that its ram had hit a wall of ice. This had to be an accident — the underwater tunnel, strewn with odd blocks, did not make for easy navigation. I thought that Captain Nemo would now adjust his route and work his way round the obstacle by following the outside of the tunnel. In any case, the forward motion would not be stopped. However, against my expectation, the Nautilus began moving backwards very fast.","It was then five in the morning; and at that moment a shock was felt at the bows of the Nautilus. I knew that its spur had struck a block of ice. It must have been a false maneuver, for this submarine tunnel, obstructed by blocks, was not very easy navigation. I thought that Captain Nemo, by changing his course, would either turn these obstacles, or else follow the windings of the tunnel. In any case, the road before us could not be entirely blocked. But, contrary to my expectations, the Nautilus took a decided retrograde motion.","By this point it was five o'clock in the morning. Just then there was a collision in the Nautilus's bow. I gathered that its spur had just bumped a chunk of ice. It must have been a faulty maneuver, because this underwater tunnel was cluttered with such chunks and didn't make for easy navigating. So I figured Captain Nemo would adjust his course and go around each obstacle by hugging the walls of the tunnel. In anycase our forward progress wouldn't receive an absolute check. Nevertheless, contrary to my expectations, the Nautilus definitely started to move backward."
"Je me dirigeai vers l’escalier central. Là, Ned Land et Conseil, très intrigués, regardaient quelques hommes de l’équipage qui ouvraient les panneaux, tandis que des cris de rage et d’épouvantables vociférations résonnaient au-dehors.","I headed for the central staircase. There, Ned Land and Conseil, very intrigued, watched some of the crew who opened the hatches, while cries of rage and terrible vociferations echoed outside.","I headed for the central stairwell. There, Ned and Conseil, puzzled and fascinated, were watching a few of the crewmen opening the hatches, whilst cries of anger and blood-curdling howls could be heard outside.","I directed my steps toward the central staircase. There Ned Land and Conseil were slyly watching some of the ship’s crew, who were opening the hatches, while cries of rage and fearful vociferations resounded outside.","I headed to the central companionway.

"— Eh ! mille diables ! oui, riposta Ned Land. C’est superbe ! Je rage d’être forcé d’en convenir. On n’a jamais rien vu de pareil. Mais ce spectacle-là pourra nous coûter cher. Et, s’il faut tout dire, je pense que nous voyons ici des choses que Dieu a voulu interdire aux regards de l’homme ! »","- Hey! a thousand devils! yes, replied Ned Land. It is superb ! I hate to be forced to agree. We have never seen anything like it. But this spectacle could cost us dearly. And, if it is necessary to say everything, I think that we see here things that God wanted to prohibit from the eyes of man! »","Isn’t it, Ned?’ ‘Hell yes,’ riposted Land. ‘It’s superb! I hate to have to agree. We’ve never seen anything like it. But this vision may cost us dear. To be frank, I think that we’re seeing things here that God wanted to hide from man’s eyes.’","“Yes, confound it! Yes,” answered Ned Land, “it is superb! I am mad at being obliged to admit it. No one has ever seen anything like it; but the sight may cost us dear. And if I must say all, I think we are seeing here things which God never intended man to see.”","“Oh damnation, yes!” Ned Land shot back. “I hate to admit it, but it's magnificent! Nobody has ever seen the like. But this sight could cost us dearly. And to tell the truth, I think we're looking at things God never intended for human eyes.”"
"— Cinq cents millions ! me répondit le capitaine Nemo. Ils y étaient, mais ils n’y sont plus.","""Five hundred million!"" replied Captain Nemo. They were there, but they are not there anymore.","‘Five hundred million!’ responded Captain Nemo. ‘There used to be, but not any more.’","“Five hundred millions they were,” answered Captain Nemo, “ but they are so no longer.”","“It was worth $100,000,000,” Captain Nemo answered me, “but not any longer!”"
"Voici quelle était cette situation. A deux milles, par tribord, apparaissait l’île Gueboroar dont la côte s’arrondissait du nord à l’ouest, comme un immense bras. Vers le sud et l’est se montraient déjà quelques têtes de coraux que le jusant laissait à découvert. Nous nous étions échoués au plein. et dans une de ces mers où les marées sont médiocres, circonstance fâcheuse pour le renflouage du Nautilus. Cependant. Le navire n’avait aucunement souffert, tant sa coque était solidement liée. Mais s’il ne pouvait ni couler, ni s’ouvrir, il risquait fort d’être à jamais attaché sur ces écueils, et alors c’en était fait de l’appareil sous-marin du capitaine Nemo.","Here is what that situation was. Two miles away, to starboard, appeared Gueboroar Island, whose coast rounded from north to west like an immense arm. To the south and east a few heads of coral were already showing, which the ebb had left uncovered. We had run aground full. and in one of those seas where the tides are mediocre, an unfortunate circumstance for the refloating of the Nautilus. However. The ship had not suffered at all, its hull was so solidly bound. But if it could neither sink nor open, it was in great danger of being permanently attached to these rocks, and then it was all over for Captain Nemo's underwater device.","The situation was as follows. Gueboroar Island was visible two miles to starboard, its coastline stretching round from the north to the west like an enormous arm. To the south and east a few heads of coral were visible, already uncovered by the ebbing tide. We had gone aground at high tide in a sea where the tides are not large, an unfortunate circumstance for the chances of refloating the Nautilus. So solidly constructed was the ship, however, that its hull was not damaged in any way. But if it could neither sink nor be holed, it ran a high risk of remaining stuck on the reefs indefinitely, in which case Captain Nemo’s submarine vessel was done for.","They were examining the situation of the vessel, and exchanging words in their incomprehensible dialect. She was situated thus: two miles, on the starboard side, appeared Gilboa, stretching from north to west like an immense arm; toward the south and east some coral showed itself, left by the ebb. We had run aground, and in one of those seas where the tides are middling—a sorry matter for the floating of the Nautilus. However, the vessel had not suffered, for her keel was solidly joined. But if she could neither glide off nor move, she ran the risk of being forever fastened to these rocks, and then Captain Nemo’s submarine vessel would be done for.","Here's what those circumstances entailed. Two miles to starboard lay Gueboroa Island, its coastline curving north to west like an immense arm. To the south and east, heads of coral were already on display, left uncovered by the ebbing waters. We'd run aground at full tide and in one of those seas whose tides are moderate, an inconvenient state of things when it came to floating the Nautilus off. However its hull was so solidly joined, the ship hadn't suffered in any way. But even though it couldn't sink or crack open, the vessel was in serious danger of being permanently attached to these reefs, in which case it would be all over for Captain Nemo's submersible."

"Le déjeuner terminé, je me rendis à terre. Le Nautilus s’était encore élevé de quelques milles pendant la nuit. Il était au large, à une grande lieue d’une côte, que dominait un pic aigu de quatre a cinq cents mètres. Le canot portait avec moi le capitaine Nemo, deux hommes de l’équipage, et les instruments, c’est-à-dire un chronomètre, une lunette et un baromètre.","Lunch over, I went ashore. The Nautilus had risen another few miles during the night. It was out to sea, a full league from a coast, dominated by a sharp peak of four or five hundred meters. The canoe carried with me Captain Nemo, two men of the crew, and the instruments, that is to say a chronometer, a telescope and a barometer.","After breakfast, I headed for land again. The Nautilus had moved a few miles further on overnight. It was now floating on the open sea a good league from the coast, which was dominated by a sharp peak 400 or 500 metres high. Captain Nemo and I were in the boat with two crewmen, along with the instruments: a chronometer, a telescope, and a barometer.","Breakfast over, we went on shore. The Nautilus had gone some miles further up in the night. It was a whole league from the coast, above which reared a sharp peak about five hundred yards high. The boat took with me Captain Nemo, two men of the crew, and the instruments, which consisted of a chronometer, a telescope, and a barometer.","Breakfast over, I made my way ashore. The Nautilus had gone a few more miles during the night. It lay agood league out from the coast, over which towered a sharp mountain peak some 1,300 to 1,600 feet high. Also in the skiff were Captain Nemo, two crew-men, and the instruments—in other words, a chronometer, a spyglass, and a barometer."
"En ce moment, rien n’est évident pour moi, je n’entrevois encore dans ces ténèbres que des lueurs, et je dois me borner à écrire, pour ainsi dire, sous la dictée des événements.","At this moment, nothing is obvious to me, I still see only glimmers in this darkness, and I must confine myself to writing, so to speak, under the dictation of events.","For the moment nothing is clear to me; I can only glimpse gleams in the dark, and must limit myself to writing, so to speak, at the dictation of events. *","At this moment nothing is clear to me; I catch but a glimpse of light amid all the darkness, and I must confine myself to writing as events shall dictate.","Right now nothing is clear to me, I still can catch only glimmers in the dark, and I need to restrict my pen to taking dictation from events, so to speak."
"— Je n’emploierai que mon chronomètre, me répondit le capitaine Nemo. Si demain, 21 mars, à midi, le disque du soleil, en tenant compte de la réfraction, est coupé exactement par l’horizon du nord, c’est que je suis au pôle sud.","""I will only use my chronometer,"" answered Captain Nemo. If tomorrow, March 21, at noon, the sun's disc, taking refraction into account, is cut exactly by the northern horizon, it means that I am at the south pole.","‘I will just use my chronometer,’ he said. ‘If tomorrow, 21 March at noon, taking account of refraction, the sun’s disc is exactly cut by the northern horizon, then I am at the South Pole.’","“I shall only use my chronometer,” replied Captain Nemo. “If tomorrow, the 21st of March, the disk of the sun, allowing for refraction, is exactly cut by the northern horizon, it will show that I am at the South Pole.”","“Tomorrow I'll use only my chronometer,” Captain Nemo answered me. “At noon on March 21, if, after accounting for refraction, the northern horizon cuts the sun's disk exactly in half, that will mean I'm at the South Pole.”"
"— Oui, répondit le Canadien, un bâtiment désemparé qui a coule a pic ! »","— Yes, answered the Canadian, a crippled vessel which sank at a steep drop! »","‘Yes,’ replied Ned Land, ‘a crippled ship that went straight down!’","“Yes,” replied the Canadian, “a disabled ship that has sunk perpendicularly.”","“Yes,” the Canadian replied, “a disabled craft that's sinking straight down!”"

"Le 23, plusieurs des officiers firent le tour de l’île, et rapportèrent quelques débris peu importants. Les naturels, adoptant un système de dénégations et de faux-fuyants, refusaient de les mener sur le lieu du sinistre. Cette conduite, très louche, laissa croire qu’ils avaient maltraité les naufragés, et, en effet, ils semblaient craindre que Dumont d’Urville ne fût venu venger La Pérouse et ses infortunés compagnons.","On the 23rd, several of the officers made the tour of the island, and brought back some unimportant debris.

The natives adopted a system of denial and evasion, refusing to guide the Frenchmen to the site of the casualty.

Couldn't it be launched diagonally against those tracts of ice, which would break open from the impact?”"
"— Bien, répondis-je, mais le Nautilus est un monde à part, et les secrets de ses savants n’arrivent pas jusqu’à la terre.","“Good,” I said, “but the Nautilus is a world apart, and the secrets of its scientists don't reach the earth.",‘But the Nautilus is a world apart and its scientists’ secrets do not reach dry land.’,"It was thus that, either by overloading her reservoirs, or by descending obliquely by means of her inclined planes the Nautilus successively attained the depth of three, four, five, seven, nine, and ten thousand yards, and the definite result of this experience was, that the sea preserved an average temperature of four degrees and a half, at a depth of five thousand fathoms, under all latitudes.","“Fine,” I replied, “but the Nautilus lives in a separate world, and the secrets of its scientists don't make their way ashore.”"
"— La seule difficulté, reprit le capitaine Nemo, sera de rester plusieurs jours immergés sans renouveler notre provision d’air.","“The only difficulty,” resumed Captain Nemo, “will be to remain submerged for several days without renewing our supply of air.","‘The only difficulty’, continued Captain Nemo, ‘will be to remain several days underwater without replenishing our reserves of air.’","“The only difficulty,” continued Captain Nemo, “is that of remaining several days without renewing our provision of air.”","“Our only difficulty,” Captain Nemo went on, “will be to stay submerged for several days without replenishing our air supply.”"
"Pendant quelques jours, le Nautilus s’écarta constamment de la côte américaine. Il ne voulait pas, évidemment, fréquenter les flots du golfe du Mexique ou de la mer des Antilles. Cependant, l’eau n’eût pas manqué sous sa quille, puisque la profondeur moyenne de ces mers est de dix-huit cents mètres ; mais, probablement ces parages, semés d’îles et sillonnés de steamers, ne convenaient pas au capitaine Nemo.","For a few days the Nautilus kept drifting away from the American coast. He obviously did not want to frequent the waves of the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean Sea. However, the water would not have failed under her keel, since the average depth of these seas is eighteen hundred meters; but probably these parts, strewn with islands and furrowed with steamers, did not suit Captain Nemo.","For several days the Nautilus kept well away from the American coast. It clearly did not wish to tarry in the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean. Nevertheless, its keel would have had plenty of water, for the average depth of these seas is 1,800 metres; but probably the waters dotted with islands and crisscrossed by steamers did not suit Captain Nemo.","FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE Nautilus kept off from the American coast. Evidently it did not wish to risk the tides of the Gulf of Mexico, or of the sea of the Antilles.","FOR A FEW DAYS the Nautilus kept veering away from the American coast. Obviously it wasn't interested in frequenting the waves of the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean Sea. Yet there was no shortage of water under its keel, because the average depth of these seas is 5,900 feet; but since these waterways are sprinkled with islands and plowed by steamers, most likely they didn't agree with Captain Nemo."

"— Seulement, monsieur Aronnax, et le calcul est facile à vérifier. Or, j’ai des réservoirs supplémentaires capables d’embarquer cent tonneaux. Je puis donc descendre à des profondeurs considérables.

"— Compte-les, Conseil. Mais tu auras plus vite fait de me croire. D’ailleurs, c’est par milliers que les Français, les Anglais, les Américains, les Danois, les Norvégiens. pêchent les morues. On les consomme en quantités prodigieuses, et sans l’étonnante fécondité de ces poissons, les mers en seraient bientôt dépeuplées.

"Passaient aussi de grands chiens de mer, poissons voraces s’il en fut. On a le droit de ne point croire aux récits des pêcheurs, mais voici ce qu’ils racontent. On a trouvé dans le corps de l’un de ces animaux une tête de buffle et un veau tout entier ; dans un autre, deux thons et un matelot en uniforme ; dans un autre, un soldat avec son sabre ; dans un autre enfin, un cheval avec son cavalier. Tout ceci, à vrai dire, n’est pas article de foi. Toujours est-il qu’aucun de ces animaux ne se laissa prendre aux filets du Nautilus, et que je ne pus vérifier leur voracité.","Also passing were large dogfish, voracious fish if ever there was one. We have the right not to believe the stories of the fishermen, but here is what they say. A buffalo head and a whole calf were found in the body of one of these animals; in another, two tunas and a sailor in uniform; in another, a soldier with his sword; finally in another, a horse with its rider. All this, to tell the truth, is not an article of faith. Still, none of these animals let themselves be caught in the nets of the Nautilus, and I could not verify their voracity.","Large dogfish also passed, voracious fish if ever there were any. One cannot lend credence to fishermen’s tales, but this is what they say. In one has been found a buffalo head and an entire calf; in another, two tuna fish and a uniformed sailor; in another, a soldier with his sword; and in a fourth, a horse and its rider. * All this, to be frank, is not necessarily gospel truth. But as not one of these animals allowed itself to be caught in the Nautilus’s nets, I was not able to check exactly how voracious they are.","One day we were followed by the boats of a whaler, who, no doubt, took us for some enormous whale of great price; but Captain Nemo did not wish the worthy fellows to lose their time and trouble, so ended the chase by plunging under the water.","Some big dogfish also went by, a voracious breed of shark if there ever was one. Fishing yarns are rightly regarded as untrustworthy, but here's what a few of them have to say. Inside the carcass of one of these creatures, fishermen found a buffalo head and a whole calf; in another, two tuna and a sailor in uniform; in yet another, a soldier with his saber; finally, in still another, a horse with its rider. Frankly none of this sounds like divine revelation. But the fact remains that not a single one of these creatures let itself get caught in the Nautilus's nets, so I couldn't verify their voracity."

No man could demand from him an account of his actions; God, if he believed in one—his conscience, if he had one—were the sole judges to whom he was answerable.","This was plain speaking. A flash of anger and scorn lit up the stranger's eyes, and I glimpsed a fearsome past in this man's life. Not only had he put himself outside human laws, he'd rendered himself independent, unreachable, free in the strictest sense of the word! Because who would dare chase him into the depths of the sea, when he could thwart all attacks on the surface? What ship could survive a collision with his underwater Monitor? What armor plate, no matter how heavy, could withstand a thrust from his spur? No man among men could require him to account for his actions. God, if he believed in Him, his conscience if he had one—these were the only judges to whom he was answerable."

"— Ah ! on sait cela ? répondit le capitaine Nemo, d’un ton légèrement surpris. Eh bien, monsieur le professeur. on a raison de le savoir, car c’est la vérité. J’ajouterai, en effet, que la vessie natatoire des poissons renferme plus d’azote que d’oxygène, quand ces animaux sont pêchés à la surface des eaux, et plus d’oxygène que d’azote, au contraire, quand ils sont tirés des grandes profondeurs. Ce qui donne raison à votre système. Mais continuons nos observations. »","- Oh! do we know that? replied Captain Nemo, in a slightly surprised tone. Well, Professor. we are right to know it, because it is the truth. I will add, in fact, that the swim bladder of fish contains more nitrogen than oxygen, when these animals are caught at the surface of the waters, and more oxygen than nitrogen, on the contrary, when they are drawn from the great depths. Which proves your system right. But let us continue our observations. »","‘Ah, that is known?’ replied Captain Nemo, in a slightly surprised tone. ‘ Well, monsieur, people are quite right to assume that, because it is the truth. I would add that the swimming bladders of fish contain more nitrogen than oxygen when they are caught on the surface, but more oxygen than nitrogen when they are drawn from the great depths; which confirms your system. But let us continue our observations.’","At 7,000 fathoms I saw some blackish tops rising from the midst of the waters; but these summits might belong to high mountains like the Himalayas or Mont Blanc, even higher; and the depth of the abyss remained incalculable.","“Oho! We know that, do we?” Captain Nemo replied in a tone of mild surprise. “Well, professor, we have good reason to know it because it's the simple truth. I might add, in fact, that the air bladders of fish hold more nitrogen than oxygen when these creatures are caught at the surface of the water, and by contrast, more oxygen than nitrogen when they're hauled up from the lower depths. Which bears out your formulation. But let's continue our investigations.”"
"En effet, la situation était périlleuse, mais le Nautilus semblait se glisser comme par enchantement au milieu de ces furieux écueils. Il ne suivait pas exactement la route de l’Astrolabe et de la Zélée qui fut fatale à Dumont d’Urville. Il prit plus au nord, rangea l’île Murray, et revint au sud-ouest, vers le passage de Cumberland. Je croyais qu’il allait y donner franchement, quand, remontant dans le nord-ouest, il se porta, à travers une grande quantité d’îles et d’îlots peu connus, vers l’île Tound et le canal Mauvais.","Indeed, the situation was perilous, but the Nautilus seemed to slip as if by magic into the midst of these furious pitfalls. It did not exactly follow the route of the Astrolabe and the Zélée, which proved fatal to Dumont d'Urville.

Une pierre taillée en pain de sucre et qu’il serrait du pied, tandis qu’une corde la rattachait à son bateau, lui servait à descendre plus rapidement au fond de la mer. C’était là tout son outillage. Arrivé au sol, par cinq mètres de profondeur environ, il se précipitait à genoux et remplissait son sac de pintadines ramassées au hasard. Puis, il remontait, vidait son sac, ramenait sa pierre, et recommençait son opération qui ne durait que trente secondes.","He was a man, a living man, an Indian, a black, a fisherman, a poor devil, no doubt, who had come to glean before the harvest. I could see the bottom of his moored canoe a few feet above his head. It plunged, and rose successively. A stone carved into a sugar loaf and which he squeezed with his foot, while a rope attached it to his boat, helped him to descend more rapidly to the bottom of the sea. These were all his tools. When he reached the ground, about five meters deep, he rushed down on his knees and filled his bag with pintadines picked up at random. Then he went back upstairs, emptied his bag, brought back his stone, and began his operation again, which lasted only thirty seconds.","It was a man — a living man, an Indian, a black — a poor devil of a diver no doubt, who had come to glean some pickings before the main harvest. I saw the keel of his boat moored some feet above his head. He dived and surfaced repeatedly. A stone cut in the shape of a sugar loaf held between his feet helped him sink more quickly, while a rope secured him to the boat. That was his only equipment. As he reached the bottom at about 15 feet, he fell to his knees and filled his net with pearl oysters, collected at random.

Donc, la question est toujours celle-ci : si une occasion favorable se présente, il faut la saisir.","""All that is fair,"" replied the Canadian. But your observation applies to any escape attempt, whether it takes place in two years or in two days. So the question is always this: if a favorable opportunity presents itself, it must be seized.","‘All that is good,’ replied the Canadian. ‘But your remark applies to any attempt to escape, whether in two years’ or two days’ time. So the conclusion remains the same: if a favourable occasion arises, we must seize it.’","“All that is true,” replied the Canadian. “But your observation applies equally to all attempts at flight, whether in two years’ time, or in two days. But the question is still this: if a favorable opportunity presents itself, it must be seized.”","“That's also right on the money,” the Canadian replied. “But your comment applies to any escape attempt, whether it's in two years or two days. So this question still has the same answer: if a promising opportunity comes up, we need to jump on it.”"

"Je demeurai ainsi jusqu’à six heures du matin, sans que le capitaine Nemo eût paru m’apercevoir.

"Il ne faudrait pas l’en défier, répondit Conseil.","He shouldn't be challenged, Conseil replied.","‘We must not try to dissuade him even if he does wish to do that,’ replied Conseil.","The next day, April 1, when the Nautilus ascended to the surface, some minutes before noon, we sighted land to the west.","“I wouldn't double dare him,” Conseil replied."

"En passant auprès de ces curieux animaux, je pus les examiner à loisir, car ils ne se dérangeaient pas. Leur peau était épaisse et rugueuse, d’un ton fauve tirant sur le roux, leur pelage court et peu fourni. Quelques-uns avaient une longueur de quatre mètres.

"Le lendemain matin, 18 novembre, j’étais parfaitement remis de mes fatigues de la veille, et je montai sur la plate-forme, au moment ou le second du Nautilus prononçait sa phrase quotidienne.
