"J’appris bien vite à mieux connaître cette fleur. Il y avait toujours eu, sur la planète du petit prince, des fleurs très simples, ornées d’un seul rang de pétales, et qui ne tenaient point de place, et qui ne dérangeaient personne. Elles apparaissaient un matin dans l’herbe, et puis elles s’éteignaient le soir. Mais celle-là avait germé un jour, d’une graine apportée d’on ne sait où, et le petit prince avait surveillé de très près cette brindille qui ne ressemblait pas aux autres brindilles. Ça pouvait être un nouveau genre de baobab. Mais l’arbuste cessa vite de croître, et commença de préparer une fleur. Le petit prince, qui assistait à l’installation d’un bouton énorme, sentait bien qu’il en sortirait une apparition miraculeuse, mais la fleur n’en finissait pas de se préparer à être belle, à l’abri de sa chambre verte. Elle choisissait avec soin ses couleurs. Elle s’habillait lentement, elle ajustait un à un ses pétales. Elle ne voulait pas sortir toute fripée comme les coquelicots. Elle ne voulait apparaître que dans le plein rayonnement de sa beauté. Eh ! oui. Elle était très coquette ! Sa toilette mystérieuse avait donc duré des jours et des jours. Et puis voici qu’un matin, justement à l’heure du lever du soleil, elle s’était montrée.","I quickly learned to know this flower better. There had always been, on the planet of the little prince, very simple flowers, adorned with a single row of petals, which did not take up any space, and which disturbed no one. They appeared one morning in the grass, and then they died out at night. But this one had germinated one day, from a seed brought from who knows where, and the little prince had watched very closely this twig which did not resemble the other twigs. It could be a new kind of baobab. But the shrub soon ceased to grow, and began to prepare a flower. The little prince, who witnessed the installation of a huge button, felt that a miraculous appearance would come out of it, but the flower never stopped preparing to be beautiful, sheltered from its green room. . She chose her colors carefully. She dressed slowly, adjusting her petals one by one. She didn't want to come out crumpled like poppies. She only wanted to appear in the full radiance of her beauty. Hey! Yes. She was very cute! Her mysterious toilet had therefore lasted for days and days. And then one morning, just at sunrise, she showed up.","I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab. The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colors with the greatest care. She dressed herself slowly. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days. Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.","I soon learned more about the flower. Flowers were simple things on the little prince’s planet and took up very little room. They only had a single ring of petals and were not at all demanding.

But the shrub soon stopped growing, and began to produce a flower. At the first appearance of a huge bud, the little prince felt he was in the presence of a miracle. But the flower took her time in its green sacntuary, getting ready to emerge. She chose her colours thoughtfully. She adjusted her petals one by one. After all, she did not wish to appear crumpled like a poppy. She wished to materialize in all her beauty. Oh was she proud! And these secret preparations lasted for many days.

"Car je n’aime pas qu’on lise mon livre à la légère. J’éprouve tant de chagrin à raconter ces souvenirs. Il y a six ans déjà que mon ami s’en est allé avec son mouton. Si j’essaie ici de le décrire, c’est afin de ne pas l’oublier. C’est triste d’oublier un ami. Tout le monde n’a pas eu un ami. Et je puis devenir comme les grandes personnes qui ne s’intéressent plus qu’aux chiffres. C’est donc pour ça encore que j’ai acheté une boîte de couleurs et des crayons. C’est dur de se remettre au dessin, à mon âge, quand on n’a jamais fait d’autres tentatives que celle d’un boa fermé et celle d’un boa ouvert, à l’âge de six ans ! J’essaierai, bien sûr, de faire des portraits le plus ressemblants possible. Mais je ne suis pas tout à fait certain de réussir. Un dessin va, et l’autre ne ressemble plus. Je me trompe un peu aussi sur la taille. Ici le petit prince est trop grand. Là il est trop petit. J’hésite aussi sur la couleur de son costume. Alors je tâtonne comme ci et comme ça, tant bien que mal. Je me tromperai enfin sur certains détails plus importants. Mais ça, il faudra me le pardonner. Mon ami ne donnait jamais d’explications. Il me croyait peut-être semblable à lui. Mais moi, malheureusement, je ne sais pas voir les moutons à travers les caisses. Je suis peut-être un peu comme les grandes personnes. J’ai dû vieillir.","Because I don't like people to read my book lightly. I feel so sad to recount these memories. Six years ago my friend left with his sheep. If I try to describe it here, it is so as not to forget it. It's sad to forget a friend. Not everyone has had a friend. And I can become like grown-ups who are only interested in numbers. So that's still why I bought a box of colors and pencils. It's hard to get back to drawing, at my age, when you've never made any other attempts than that of a closed boa and that of an open boa, at the age of six! I will try, of course, to make portraits as similar as possible. But I'm not quite sure I'll succeed. One design goes, and the other no longer looks like. I make some errors, also on the size. Here the little prince is too big. There it is too small. I'm also hesitant about the color of his costume. So I grope like this and like that, somehow. Finally, I will be wrong on some more important details. But that, you will have to forgive me. My friend never gave explanations. Maybe he thought I was like him. But me, unfortunately, I don't know how to see the sheep through the crates. Maybe I'm a bit like grown-ups. I must have got older.","For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep.

And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures . . . It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the little prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling. In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.","I do not want anyone to read my book carelessly.

I will certainly try to make my portraits as realistic as possible. But I don’t know if I will succeed. One drawing looks fine, but the other looks nothing like him. I don’t seem to get the little prince’s height right either. He is too tall in one and too small in another. Neither am I sure about the colour of his clothes.

"Et, sur les indications du petit prince, j’ai dessiné cette planète-là. Je n’aime guère prendre le ton d’un moraliste. Mais le danger des baobabs est si peu connu, et les risques courus par celui qui s’égarerait dans un astéroïde sont si considérables, que, pour une fois, je fais exception à ma réserve. Je dis : ""Enfants ! Faites attention aux baobabs !"" C’est pour avertir mes amis d’un danger qu’ils frôlaient depuis longtemps, comme moi-même, sans le connaître, que j’ai tant travaillé ce dessin-là. La leçon que je donnais en valait la peine. Vous vous demanderez peut-être : Pourquoi n’y a-t-il pas, dans ce livre, d’autres dessins aussi grandioses que le dessin des baobabs ? La réponse est bien simple : J’ai essayé mais je n’ai pas pu réussir. Quand j’ai dessiné les baobabs j’ai été animé par le sentiment de l’urgence.","And, on the instructions of the little prince, I drew this planet. I do not like to sound like a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little known, and the risks run by anyone who gets lost in an asteroid are so considerable, that for once I make an exception to my reserve. I say: ""Children! Watch out for the baobabs!"" It was to warn my friends of a danger that they had been brushing against for a long time, like myself, without knowing it, that I worked so hard on this drawing. The lesson I was giving was worth it. You may wonder: Why aren't there other drawings in this book as grandiose as the drawing of the baobabs? The answer is very simple: I tried but I could not succeed. When I drew the baobabs I was driven by a sense of urgency.","So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. "" Children,"" I say plainly, ""watch out for the baobabs!"" My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me. Perhaps you will ask me, ""Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?"" The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.","So, from the description that the little prince provided, I made a drawing of that planet. I am not trying to preach, but the baobabs are a hazard that is not at all understood; especially those who might get lost on an asteroid must be told about them. Therefore, I quietly did what I was asked. I worked energetically on this drawing so that my friends could be informed of this serious danger. So I say: Children, watch out for the baobabs! You might find it curious that there is no other drawing in the book as spectacular as that of the baobabs. I did try; I tried very hard, but without any success. With the baobabs, I think, I was compelled by the grave importance of the matter."
