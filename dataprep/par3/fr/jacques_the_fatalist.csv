"Quand on n’écoute pas celui qui parle, c’est qu’on ne pense à rien, ou qu’on pense à autre chose que ce qu’il dit : lequel des deux faisiez-vous ?","When we don't listen to the speaker, it's because we don't think of anything, or we think of something other than what he says: which of the two were you doing?","If a man doesn't listen when another person is talking, then either he's not thinking anything at all or else he's thinking about something which isn't the same as the thing the other person is saying. Which were you doing?",When a person doesn’t listen to someone who is speaking it’s either because they are thinking about nothing or thinking about something else other than what the speaker is saying. Which were you doing?

"Ils sont entrés dans la ville, car c’est dans une ville que Jacques et son maître avaient séjourné la veille ; je me le rappelle à l’instant. Les habitants quittent leurs maisons, se joignent aux paysans et au porte-balle, tous vont criant à l’unisson : « Au voleur ! au voleur ! à l’assassin !… » Tous atteignent Jacques en même temps. Le porte-balle s’élançant sur lui, Jacques lui détache un coup de botte, dont il est renversé par terre, mais n’en criant pas moins : « Coquin, fripon, scélérat, rends-moi ma montre ; tu me la rendras, et tu n’en seras pas moins pendu… » Jacques, gardant son sang-froid, s’adressait à la foule qui grossissait à chaque instant, et disait : « Il y a un magistrat de police ici, qu’on me mène chez lui : là, je ferai voir que je ne suis point un coquin, et que cet homme en pourrait bien être un. Je lui ai pris une montre, il est vrai ; mais cette montre est celle de mon maître. Je ne suis point inconnu dans cette ville : avant-hier au soir nous y arrivâmes mon maître et moi, et nous avons séjourné chez M. le lieutenant général, son ancien ami. » Si je ne vous ai pas dit plus tôt que Jacques et son maître avaient passé par Conches, et qu’ils avaient logé chez M. le lieutenant général de ce lieu, c’est que cela ne m’est pas revenu plus tôt. « Qu’on me conduise chez M. le lieutenant général », disait Jacques, et en même temps il mit pied à terre. On le voyait au centre du cortège, lui, son cheval et le porte-balle. Ils marchent, ils arrivent à la porte du lieutenant général. Jacques, son cheval et le porte-balle entrent, Jacques et le porte-balle se tenant l’un l’autre à la boutonnière. La foule reste en dehors.","They entered the city, for it was in a city that Jacques and his master had stayed the day before; I remember it right now. The inhabitants leave their houses, join the peasants and the ball carrier, all go shouting in unison: “Thief! thief ! To the assassin!…” All reach Jacques at the same time. The ball-carrier rushing at him, Jacques unleashes his boot, knocking him down on the ground, but shouting none the less: “Rogue, scoundrel, scoundrel, give me back my watch; you'll give it back to me, and you'll be no less hanged for it..."" Jacques, keeping his composure, addressed the crowd, which grew bigger every moment, and said: ""There is a police magistrate here, who I am taken to his house: there, I will show that I am not a rascal, and that this man could very well be one. I took a watch from him, it is true; but this watch is my master's. I am not unknown in this town: the evening before yesterday my master and I arrived there, and we stayed with the Lieutenant-General, his old friend. ""If I did not tell you earlier that Jacques and his master had passed through Conches, and that they had lodged with the lieutenant-general of that place, it is because it did not come back to me sooner. ""Let me be taken to the Lieutenant-General's,"" said Jacques, and at the same time he dismounted. We saw him in the center of the procession, him, his horse and the ball carrier. They walk, they arrive at the door of the lieutenant general. Jacques, his horse and the ball carrier enter, Jacques and the ball carrier holding each other at the buttonhole. The crowd stays outside.","They reach the town—for it was indeed in a town that Jacques and his Master had spent the previous night: I've just remembered. The townspeople come out of their houses and join forces with the peasants and the packman, shouting in unison: 'Stop thief! Stop thief! Murder!' They all catch up with Jacques at the same time. As the packman makes a leap at him, Jacques unleashes a jab with his boot that lays him out flat on the ground, though he still goes on bawling: 'Rogue, villain, swine, give me my watch back! And even if you give it back, that won't stop you getting hung!' Jacques, keeping a cool head, harangued the crowd which kept growing bigger all the time: 'There's a justice of the peace here, so take me to him. There, I'll prove that I'm no thief and that this man could very well be. Yes, it's true I took a watch off him. But the watch belongs to my Master. I'm not entirely unknown in town. When we got here the evening before last we stayed with the Lieutenant-Governor, who's an old friend of his.' If I didn't mention earlier that Jacques and his Master had travelled by way of Conches* and spent the night under the roof of the Lieutenant-Governor there, it's because it's only just come back to me now. 'Take me to the Lieutenant-Governor,' said Jacques, and so saying he dismounted. He stood out in the middle of the procession, him, his horse, and the packman. They march on and arrive outside the gates of the Lieutenant-Governor's house. Jacques, his horse, and the packman go inside, with Jacques and the packman keeping firm hold of each other by the lapels. The mob stayed outside.","They entered the town, because it was in a town that Jacques and his master had spent the previous night, I remember it now. The townspeople left their dwellings and joined the peasants and the pedlar, all going along shouting in unison ‘Thief! Thief! Murderer!’ and they all caught up with Jacques at the same moment. The pedlar threw himself on to Jacques, who lashed out at him with a kick which knocked him to the ground but did not stop him shouting: ‘Rogue, rascal, scoundrel, give me back my watch! You’ll give it back to me and you’ll still be hanged for it…’ Jacques retained his composure, addressed the crowd, which was growing larger every moment, and said: ‘There is a magistrate here. Take me to him. When we get there I’ll show you that I’m not a thief, but this man might be one. I am not unknown in this town. The day before yesterday evening my master and I arrived here and we stayed with the Lieutenant-Governor,8 my master’s old friend…’ If I did not say sooner that Jacques and his master had passed through Conches and that they had stayed with the Lieutenant-Governor of this place, then that is because it didn’t come back to me any earlier. ‘Take me to the Lieutenant-Governor,’ said Jacques, and dismounted. Jacques, his horse and the pedlar were in the middle of the procession. They set off and arrived at the gate of the Lieutenant-Governor’s house. Jacques, his horse and the pedlar went in, Jacques and the pedlar holding each other by the lapels. The crowd stayed outside."
"Cette menace de Jacques fit tomber subitement la fureur de son maître, qui lui dit d’un ton radouci : « Et ma montre ?","This threat from Jacques suddenly brought down the fury of his master, who said to him in a softened tone: “And my watch?","This threat immediately took the wind out of the fury of the Master, who said in a calmer voice: 'What about my watch?'","This threat of Jacques’ had the sudden effect of calming the wrath of his master, who asked him in a gentler manner: ‘ And my watch?’"

"Allons donc, Jacques, vous vous moquez ; vous ne connaissez pas M. Le Brun. Je lui proposai de reconnaître ses bons offices : il se fâcha, il me répondit que je le prenais apparemment pour un Mathieu de Fourgeot ; qu’il n’avait jamais tendu la main. « Voilà mon cher Le Brun, s’écria le chevalier, c’est toujours lui-même ; mais nous rougirions qu’il fût plus honnête que nous… » Et à l’instant il prit parmi nos marchandises deux douzaines de mouchoirs, une pièce de mousseline, qu’il lui fit accepter pour sa femme et pour sa fille. Le Brun se mit à considérer les mouchoirs, qui lui parurent si beaux, la mousseline qu’il trouva si fine, cela lui était offert de si bonne grâce, il avait une si prochaine occasion de prendre sa revanche avec nous par la vente des effets qui restaient entre ses mains, qu’il se laissa vaincre ; et nous voilà partis, et nous acheminant à toutes jambes de fiacre vers la demeure de celle que j’aimais, et à qui la garniture, les manchettes et la bague étaient destinées. Le présent réussit à merveille. On fut charmante. On essaya sur-le-champ la garniture et les manchettes ; la bague semblait avoir été faite pour le doigt. On soupa, et gaiement comme tu penses bien.","Come on, Jacques, you're kidding; you don't know M. Le Brun. I proposed to him to recognize his good offices: he got angry, he replied that I apparently took him for a Mathieu de Fourgeot; that he had never held out his hand. ""Here is my dear Le Brun,"" cried the chevalier, ""it is still himself; but we would blush that he was more honest than us…” And at once he took among our goods two dozen handkerchiefs, a piece of muslin, which he made him accept for his wife and his daughter. Le Brun began to consider the handkerchiefs, which seemed to him so beautiful, the muslin which he found so fine, it had been offered to him with such good grace, he had such an imminent opportunity to take his revenge with us by selling the effects. which remained in his hands, that he allowed himself to be conquered; and off we went, making our way at top speed to the abode of her whom I loved, and for whom the garnish, the cuffs, and the ring were intended. The present succeeds wonderfully. We were charming. They immediately tried on the upholstery and the cuffs; the ring seemed to have been made for the finger. We supped, and gaily as you can imagine.","Come, come, Jacques, don't be naive. You don't know what Monsieur Le Brun was like. I suggested I might offer him something for his good offices. He got angry, said I must think he was another Mathieu de Fourgeot, and told me he'd never asked for anything. 'That's my friend Le Brun for you,' exclaimed the Chevalier. ' He never changes. But it would be embarrassing if he turned out to be more honest than us.' Whereupon he rummaged through our stock and picked out two dozen handkerchiefs and a length of muslin which he made Le Brun take for his wife and daughter. Le Brun began examining the handkerchiefs, which he judged to be very pretty, and the muslin, which he said was very fine, adding that because the gifts had been offered with such good grace and since he would soon have the opportunity of paying us back by selling the stock we had left with him, he would allow himself to be prevailed upon. And then we were gone and were soon bowling along as fast as our carriage would take us towards the house of the woman I loved and for whom the diamond necklace, the lace cuffs, and the ring were intended. The present was a great success. She was bewitching. She tried on the diamond necklace and the cuffs immediately and the ring seemed as if it had been made for her finger. We went in to supper and were very merry, as you might imagine.","Come along, Jacques, you are joking. You do not know M. Le Brun. I suggested to him that I should reward his good offices. He got angry with me and replied that I apparently took him for a Mathieu de Fourgeot, and that he had never asked for anything. ‘Good old Monsieur Le Brun,’ exclaimed the Chevalier, ‘he’s always the same. We would be embarrassed if you were more honest than us…’ And straight away he took out from amongst our merchandise two dozen handkerchiefs and a piece of muslin, which he asked him to accept for his wife and daughter. Le Brun started to contemplate the handkerchiefs which appeared so beautiful to him, the muslin which he found so fine. It was offered to him with such good grace and he had so close at hand the opportunity to repay our kindness through the sale of the goods which remained in his hands that he allowed himself to be won over. And then we were gone, going as fast as our carriage would take us towards the home of her whom I loved and for whom the set of jewels, the lace cuffs and the ring were destined. The present worked like magic. She was charming and tried on the set of jewels and the lace cuffs straight away. The ring seemed to have been made for her finger. We dined merrily as you can well imagine."

"À mon réveil, j’entrouvris doucement mes rideaux, et je vis mon hôte, sa femme et le chirurgien en conférence secrète vers la fenêtre.

"Oui, mais en récit ; car en couleur et sur la toile, quoique j’en juge aussi décidément qu’un amateur, je t’avouerai que je n’y entends rien du tout ; que je serais bien embarrassé de distinguer une école d’une autre ; qu’on me donnerait un Boucher pour un Rubens ou pour un Raphaël ; que je prendrais une mauvaise copie pour un sublime original ; que j’apprécierais mille écus une croûte de six francs ; et six francs un morceau de mille écus ; et que je ne me suis jamais pourvu qu’au pont Notre-Dame, chez un certain Tremblin, qui était de mon temps la ressource de la misère ou du libertinage, et la ruine du talent des jeunes élèves de Vanloo.","Yes, but in narrative; for in color and on the canvas, although I judge them as decidedly as an amateur, I will confess to you that I understand nothing at all; that I would be very embarrassed to distinguish one school from another; that I would be given a Butcher for a Rubens or for a Raphael; that I would take a bad copy for a sublime original; that I would appreciate a thousand crowns for a crust of six francs; and six francs a piece of a thousand crowns; and that I never provided myself except at the Pont Notre-Dame, with a certain Tremblin, who in my time was the resource of poverty or libertinism, and the ruin of the talent of the young pupils of Vanloo.","Yes, but only word pictures. Pictures which are just colour on canvas, though I can pronounce on them as authoritatively as any connoisseur , I confess I don't understand at all. I'd be hard put to tell one school from another. You could show me a Boucher and say it was a Rubens or a Raphael. * I couldn't see the difference between a bad copy and a brilliant original. I'd put a price of a three thousand livres on a daub worth six francs, and offer six francs for a masterpiece worth three thousand livres. I freely admit that all the paintings I ever bought I got on the Pont-Neuf, from a man named Tremblin, who in my day was a lifeline for struggling artists, a supplier of dirty pictures, and the ruination of the talent of Vanloo's young pupils.","Yes, but only verbal pictures, because when they are in colour on canvas, although I am as trenchant in my verdicts as any connoisseur, I will admit to you that I don’t know anything about them at all and I would be very hard put to tell the difference between one School and another. I would take a Boucher for a Rubens or a Raphael and I would mistake a bad copy for the sublime original. I would pay a thousand écus for some daub worth six francs and six francs for something worth a thousand écus. And I have always bought paintings at the Pont Notre-Dame at the Gallery of a certain Tremblin, who in my youth was the dealer for those who hadn’t much money or who wanted salacious stuff and who ruined the talent of Vanloo’s young pupils.51"

"Je serais de moitié ; mais en vérité je ne sais pourquoi, car je n’ai point été satisfait de cette fille pendant tout le cours des menées de la dame de La Pommeraye et de sa mère. Pas un instant de crainte, pas le moindre signe d’incertitude, pas un remords ; je l’ai vue se prêter, sans aucune répugnance, à cette longue horreur. Tout ce qu’on a voulu d’elle, elle n’a jamais hésité à le faire ; elle va à confesse ; elle communie ; elle joue la religion et ses ministres. Elle m’a semblé aussi fausse, aussi méprisable, aussi méchante que les deux autres… Notre hôtesse, vous narrez assez bien ; mais vous n’êtes pas encore profonde dans l’art dramatique. Si vous vouliez que cette jeune fille intéressât, il fallait lui donner de la franchise, et nous la montrer victime innocente et forcée de sa mère et de La Pommeraye, il fallait que les traitements les plus cruels l’entraînassent, malgré qu’elle en eût, à concourir à une suite de forfaits continus pendant une année ; il fallait préparer ainsi le raccommodement de cette femme avec son mari. Quand on introduit un personnage sur la scène, il faut que son rôle soit un : or je vous demanderai, notre charmante hôtesse, si la fille qui complote avec deux scélérates est bien la femme suppliante que nous avons vue aux pieds de son mari ? Vous avez péché contre les règles d’Aristote, d’Horace, de Vida et de Le Bossu.","I would be half; but in truth I do not know why, for I was not satisfied with this girl during the whole course of the intrigues of the lady of La Pommeraye and her mother. Not a moment of fear, not the slightest sign of uncertainty, not a remorse; I saw her lend herself, without any repugnance, to this long horror. Everything that was wanted of her, she never hesitated to do; she goes to confession; she takes communion; it plays religion and its ministers. She seemed to me as false, as despicable, as wicked as the other two... Our hostess, you narrate well enough; but you are not yet deep in drama. If you wanted this young girl to be interesting, you had to give her frankness, and show her to us as an innocent and forced victim of her mother and La Pommeraye, the most cruel treatment had to drag her down, despite her had to contribute to a series of continuous forfeits for a year; it was thus necessary to prepare the reconciliation of this woman with her husband. When we introduce a character on the stage, her role must be one: now I will ask you, our charming hostess, if the girl who plots with two scoundrels is really the supplicating woman whom we saw at her husband's feet? You have sinned against the rules of Aristotle, Horace, Vida and The Hunchback.","And I'd go halves with you, though I really can't think why, because I wasn't at all happy with the girl all through the time when Madame de La Pommeraye and her mother were deviously plotting. Never felt afraid for one moment, gave no sign that she was unsure of herself or that she felt any remorse. I did not see her protesting against her role throughout the whole ghastly business. She did not hesitate to do whatever was required of her. She goes to confession, takes communion, makes a mockery of religion and its ministers. To me, she seemed as deceitful, as contemptible, as wicked as both the others... Madame, you tell a very good story, but you are not yet sufficiently skilled in the art of drama. If you really wanted us to feel for the girl, you should have made her more outspoken and shown her as the innocent victim forced into what she did by her mother and Madame de La Pommeraye. You needed to demonstrate that it was because she was cruelly used that she went along, against her will, with a succession of crimes spread over a whole year. That way you would have prepared the ground for her reconciliation with her husband. When you bring a character on stage, that character must be consistent. Now, I ask you, dear lady, is the young woman who plotted with those two wicked females the same as the wife we saw pleading at her husband's feet? You have infringed the rules of Aristotle, Horace, Vida, and Le Bossu. *","I do not know why because I was not at all happy with this girl during the course of the schemings between Mme de La Pommeraye and the girl’s mother.

I will remember one to hate me, the other to admire you, to redouble my attachment to you.","It seemed to me that the best thing to do was to treat the whole thing as a joke.

I doubt if I'd have had the generosity or the strength to forgive you a similar wrong, but you, you make light of it! No man ever behaved so well. What can I do to make amends? No, it's not something anyone can ever put right. I shall never, never forget my offence or your forbearance, for both are deeply etched in my heart.

My friend, what could I do that could ever make amends?… Ah! No, no, that is not the kind of thing one can make amends for. Never, never will I forget either my crime or your leniency.

But she held me back and whispered in my ear: 'I'd never have thought you could be so nasty. I see I can't expect any pity from you, but at least, promise me, swear that...'","But I do know that I didn’t do her any harm and she didn’t do me any harm either!

"Suzon avait eu le temps de se relever ; je me rajuste, me sauve, et c’est Suzon qui m’a raconté ce qui suit. Le mari qui voit le vicaire perché sur le fenil, se met à rire. Le vicaire lui disait : « Ris… ris… ris bien… so… so… sot que tu es… » Le mari de lui obéir, de rire de plus belle, et de lui demander qui est-ce qui l’a niché là : Le vicaire : « Met… met… mets-moi à te… te…. terre. » Le mari de rire encore, et de lui demander comment il faut qu’il s’y prenne : Le vicaire : « Co… co… comme j’y… j’y… j’y suis mon… mon… monté, a… a… avec la fou… fou… fourche… – Par sanguienne, vous avez raison ; voyez ce que c’est que d’avoir étudié ?… » Le mari prend la fourche, la présente au vicaire ; celui-ci s’enfourche comme je l’avais enfourché ; le mari lui fait faire un ou deux tours de grange au bout de l’instrument de basse cour, accompagnant cette promenade d’une espèce de chant en faux bourdon ; et le vicaire criait : « Dé… dé… descends-moi, ma… ma… maraud, me… me dé… dé… descendras… dras-tu ?… » Et le mari lui disait : « À quoi tient-il, monsieur le vicaire, que je ne vous montre ainsi dans toutes les rues du village ? On n’y aurait jamais vu une aussi belle procession… » Cependant le vicaire en fut quitte pour la peur, et le mari le mit à terre. Je ne sais ce qu’il dit alors au mari, car Suzon s’était évadée ; mais j’entendis : « Ma… ma… malheureux ! tu… tu… fra… fra… frappes un… un… prê… prê… prêtre ; je… je… t’e… t’ex… co… co… communie ; tu… tu… se… seras da… da… damné… » C’était le petit homme qui parlait : et c’était le mari qui le pourchassait à coups de fourche. J’arrive avec beaucoup d’autres ; d’aussi loin que le mari m’aperçut, mettant sa fourche en arrêt. « Approche, approche », me dit-il.","Suzon had had time to get up; I readjust myself, run away, and it was Suzon who told me what follows. The husband, who sees the curate perched on the hayloft, begins to laugh. The vicar said to him: ""Laugh... laugh... laugh well... so... so... stupid that you are..."" The husband obeyed her, laughed even more, and asked her who put him there: The vicar: “Put… put… put me to you… you…. earth. The husband laughs again, and asks him how he should go about it: …a… with the crazy… crazy… fork… – By sanguienne, you are right; see what it is to have studied?…” The husband takes the pitchfork, presents it to the vicar; this one straddles as I had straddled him; the husband takes her one or two rounds of the barn at the end of the barnyard instrument, accompanying this walk with a sort of drone-like song; and the vicar shouted: “D… d… take me down, my… my… tramp, me… me d… d… go down… dras you?…” And the husband said to him: “What is he up to, Mr. vicar, that I don't show you like this in all the streets of the village? We would never have seen such a beautiful procession there…” However, the vicar got off with fear, and the husband put him on the ground. I do not know what he then said to the husband, for Suzon had escaped; but I heard: “My…my…unhappy!” you... you... fra... fra... strike a... a... ready... ready... priest; I… I… you are… you ex… co… co… communie; you... you... se... will be da... da... damned...” It was the little man who was speaking: and it was the husband who was chasing him with his pitchfork. I come with many others; as far as the husband saw me, putting his pitchfork on hold. “Approach, approach,” he told me.","Suzanne has just enough time to get to her feet. I adjust my clothes, make myself scarce, and afterwards Suzanne told me what happened next. Her husband spots the curate perched up in the hayloft and bursts out laughing. The curate said: 'G-g-go on and l-l-laugh, you s-s-stupid cuc-cuc-clod.' Her husband did what he was told, laughed even louder, and asked him who it was had pitchforked him up there. 'G-g-get me d-d-down from huh-huh-here!' Her husband laughed some more and asks him how exactly he is to set about doing it. 'The w-w-way I g-g-got up, w-w-with a p-p-pitchf-f-fork.' 'By the Virgin and all the saints, you're right! That's what book-learning does for you.' Her husband grabs the fork, holds it out to the curate, who puts it between his legs the way I had. Then the farmer marches round the barn a couple of times with him on the end of it, intoning a sort of dirge as he goes, with the curate screeching: ' L-l-let m-me d-d-down, you gray-gray-great oh-oh-oaf! P-p-put m-me d-d-down at wuh-wuh-once!' And Suzanne's husband said: 'Reverend, what's to stop me parading you like this through every street in the village? Folks won't have seen another procession like it ever.' But the curate was let off with a fright, for her husband set him down on terra firma. I don't know what he said to the farmer, because Suzanne had made off by then, but I did catch the following myself: 'Y-you r-r-wretch! S-s-strike a pup-pup-priest would y-you! I e-e-excommunicate you! Y-you'll bub-bub-burn in huh-huh-hell!' It was the small oaf who was saying this while the great oaf of a farmer chased him, swatting him with the pitchfork. I was still a good way off when he spotted me. He stopped his good work with the pitchfork and called out to me: 'Come here you!'","Suzon just had time to get up. I adjusted my clothing and ran off and Suzon told me what happened later. As soon as the husband saw the priest perched on top of the hayloft he burst out laughing. The priest said: ‘That’s right, laugh, you fool.’ And so the husband laughed even more and asked who had perched him up there. PRIEST: Lll… ll… let me ddd… dd… down! The husband carried on laughing and asked how he should go about that. PRIEST: Lll… ll… like I ggg… gg… got up here, www… ww… with a ppp… pp… pitchfork. ‘Hell’s teeth, you’re right. That’s what comes of having studied.’ So the husband took the pitchfork and presented it to the priest who straddled himself on it as I’d done with him. The husband then carried him round the barn on the end of it a few times singing a sort of plainchant while the priest was yelling: ‘Lll… ll… let me ddd… dd… down you rrr … rr… ruffian!’ The husband said: ‘Monsieur le vicaire, why should I not show you like this along all the roads in the village? They can’t ever have seen such a pretty procession as this.’ However, the priest was let off with just the threat and the husband got him down. I don’t know what he said to the husband next because Suzon ran away. But a little while later I heard: ‘Www… ww… wretch, you ddd… dd… dare to sss… ss … strike a ppp… pp… priest. I exccc… cc… communiccc… cc… cate you. You will be ddd… dd… damned!’ It was the little man who was speaking and he was being chased by the husband, who was hitting him with the pitchfork. I arrived with a crowd of others. From a long way off the husband saw me, stopped his business with the pitchfork and said: ‘Come here.’"

"Nos femmes ne doutaient pas qu’incessamment l’homme de Dieu ne hasardât de remettre une lettre à sa pénitente : ce qui fut fait ; mais avec quel ménagement ! Il ne savait de qui elle était ; il ne doutait point que ce ne fût de quelque âme bienfaisante et charitable qui avait découvert leur misère, et qui leur proposait des secours ; il en remettait assez souvent de pareilles. « Au demeurant vous êtes sage, madame votre mère est prudente, et j’exige que vous ne l’ouvriez qu’en sa présence. » Mlle Duquênoi accepta la lettre et la remit à sa mère, qui la fit passer sur le champ à Mme de La Pommeraye. Celle-ci, munie de ce papier, fit venir le prêtre, l’accabla des reproches qu’il méritait, et le menaça de le déférer à ses supérieurs, si elle entendait encore parler de lui.","Our women had no doubt that the man of God would immediately venture to deliver a letter to his penitent: which was done; but with what care! He did not know whose she was; he had no doubt that it was some benevolent and charitable soul who had discovered their misery, and who offered them help; he often gave similar ones. “As for the rest, you are wise, your mother is prudent, and I demand that you do not open it except in her presence. Mademoiselle Duquenoi accepted the letter and handed it to her mother, who passed it on to Madame de La Pommeraye. The latter, furnished with this paper, summoned the priest, overwhelmed him with the reproaches he deserved, and threatened to refer him to his superiors, if she heard any more of him.","All three women were in no doubt that at any moment this man of God would venture to convey a letter to his penitent. And so it came to pass. But how circumspectly did he set about it! He did not know who it was from, though he was quite convinced it must have come from some kindly, philanthropic soul who had learned of their plight and was offering to help. This was not the first such letter he had passed on to women in such circumstances. 'In any case,' said he, 'you are a good girl and your mother is very sensible. I insist that you open it only in her presence.' So Mademoiselle Duquenoi took the letter and gave it to her mother, who forwarded it immediately to Madame de La Pommeraye. Armed with the epistle, she sent for the priest, heaped reproaches on his head as he deserved, and threatened to inform his superiors if similar reports of his conduct ever came to her attention again.","The three women were certain that very soon the man of God would risk giving a letter to his penitent, and this he did. But what a performance he made of it! He didn’t know who it came from. He was certain, however, that it had come from some well-meaning charitable soul who had discovered how badly off the two ladies were and was offering help. He often passed on similar letters. He advised that since the girl was wise and her mother prudent she should open the letter only in her mother’s presence. Mademoiselle Duquênoi accepted the letter and gave it to her mother, who straight away sent it to Mme de La Pommeraye. She, armed with the letter, summoned the priest, overwhelmed him with the reproaches he deserved and threatened to report him to his superiors if he caused any more trouble."

"Comme ils en étaient là, ils entendirent à quelque distance derrière eux du bruit et des cris ; ils retournèrent la tête, et virent une troupe d’hommes armés de gaules et de fourches qui s’avançaient vers eux à toutes jambes. Vous allez croire que c’étaient les gens de l’auberge, leurs valets et les brigands dont nous avons parlé. Vous allez croire que le matin on avait enfoncé leur porte faute de clefs, et que ces brigands s’étaient imaginé que nos deux voyageurs avaient décampé avec leurs dépouilles. Jacques le crut, et il disait entre ses dents : « Maudites soient les clefs et la fantaisie ou la raison qui me les fit emporter ! Maudite soit la prudence ! etc. etc. » Vous allez croire que cette petite armée tombera sur Jacques et son maître, qu’il y aura une action sanglante, des coups de bâton donnés, des coups de pistolet tirés ; et il ne tiendrait qu’à moi que tout cela n’arrivât ; mais adieu la vérité de l’histoire, adieu le récit des amours de Jacques. Nos deux voyageurs n’étaient point suivis : j’ignore ce qui se passa dans l’auberge après leur départ. Ils continuèrent leur route, allant toujours sans savoir où ils allaient, quoiqu’ils sussent à peu près où ils voulaient aller ; trompant l’ennui et la fatigue par le silence et le bavardage, comme c’est l’usage de ceux qui marchent, et quelquefois de ceux qui sont assis.","As they were there, they heard some distance behind them noise and shouting; they turned their heads, and saw a troop of men armed with poles and pitchforks advancing towards them at full speed. You will believe that it was the people of the inn, their servants and the brigands of whom we have spoken. You will believe that in the morning their door had been broken down for lack of keys, and that these brigands had imagined that our two travelers had decamped with their remains. Jacques believed him, and he said between his teeth: ""Cursed be the keys and the fancy or the reason which made me take them away!"" Cursed be caution! etc etc You will believe that this little army will fall on Jacques and his master, that there will be a bloody action, blows given with sticks, pistol shots fired; and it would be up to me that all this did not happen; but farewell to the truth of the story, farewell to the story of the loves of Jacques. Our two travelers were not followed: I do not know what happened in the inn after their departure. They continued on their way, still going without knowing where they were going, although they knew approximately where they wanted to go; deceiving boredom and fatigue by silence and chatter, as is the custom of those who walk, and sometimes of those who sit.","They'd got this far when they heard, some distance to their rear, a noise and shouting. They turned to look and saw a gang of men armed with poles and pitchforks heading straight for them as fast as their legs could carry them. Now, you're thinking that these were the men from the inn, the cut-throats and servants we mentioned. You're thinking that when it was morning, the doors with no keys had been broken down and the robbers had concluded that our two travellers had decamped with their effects. Jacques certainly thought so and muttered: ' Damn the keys and damn the whim or reason which made me bring them with me. Damn prudence, etc., etc.!' You're thinking that this small army is about to set about Jacques and his Master, that there'll be a bloody battle, with much laying on of sticks and many pistols fired. And there would be too, if I so chose. But then you could say farewell to the truth of this narrative and goodbye to the story of Jacques's loves. Our two travellers were not pursued. I've no idea what happened at the inn after they left. They simply carried on their way, still plodding along without knowing where they were going, though they had a fairly clear idea of where they wanted to go, warding off boredom and fatigue by silence and idle talk as is the wont of those who travel by foot, and sometimes too of those who stay sitting where they are.","At this point they heard a lot of noise and shouting coming from some distance behind them. They looked round and saw a band of men armed with sticks and forks coming towards them as fast as they could run. You are going to believe that it was the people from the inn and their servants and the brigands we have spoken of. You are going to believe that in the morning they broke down their doors since they didn’t have the keys and that these brigands thought that our travellers had decamped with their possessions. That is what Jacques thought and he said between his teeth: ‘Damn the keys and damn the fantasy or reason which made me take them. Damn prudence, etc. etc.!’ You are going to believe that this little army will fall upon Jacques and his master, that there will be a bloody fight, blows with sticks and pistol shots, and if I wanted to I could make all of these things happen, but then it would be goodbye to the truth of the story and goodbye to the story of Jacques’ loves. Our two travellers were not followed. I do not know what happened in the inn after they left. They carried on their way still going without knowing where they were going although they knew more or less where they wanted to go, relieving their boredom and fatigue by silence and conversation, as is the custom of those who walk, and sometimes of those who are sitting down."

"Cette aventure-là sera pour la route ; l’autre est courte. Il avait fait sa fortune au jeu. Il s’attacha à une femme que tu auras pu voir dans son château, femme d’esprit, mais sérieuse, taciturne, originale et dure. Cette femme lui dit un jour : « Ou vous m’aimez mieux que le jeu, et en ce cas donnez-moi votre parole d’honneur que vous ne jouerez jamais ; ou vous aimez mieux le jeu que moi, et en ce cas ne me parlez plus de votre passion, et jouez tant qu’il vous plaira… » Desglands donna sa parole d’honneur qu’il ne jouerait plus. – Ni gros ni petit jeu ? – Ni gros ni petit jeu. Il y avait environ dix ans qu’ils vivaient ensemble dans le château que tu connais, lorsque Desglands, appelé à la ville par une affaire d’intérêt eut le malheur de rencontrer chez son notaire une de ses anciennes connaissances de brelan, qui l’entraîna à dîner dans un tripot, où il perdit en une seule séance tout ce qu’il possédait. Sa maîtresse fut inflexible ; elle était riche ; elle fit à Desglands une pension modique et se sépara de lui pour toujours.","This adventure will be for the road; the other is short. He had made his fortune gambling. He became attached to a woman whom you may have seen in his castle, a woman of wit, but serious, taciturn, original and tough. This woman said to him one day: “Either you love me better than gambling, and in that case give me your word of honor that you will never gamble; or you like gambling better than me, and in that case don't talk to me any more about your passion, and play as long as you please..."" Desglands gave his word of honor that he would not play any more. – Neither big nor small game? “Neither big nor small game. They had been living together in the chateau you know for about ten years, when Desglands, called to town on a matter of interest, had the misfortune to meet at his notary’s house one of his former Brelan's acquaintances, who took him to dinner in a gambling den, where he lost everything he owned in a single sitting. His mistress was inflexible; she was rich; she gave Desglands a modest pension and separated from him forever.","We'll keep the story of his patch for when we're on the road. But there's another one that's shorter. He'd made his fortune from gambling. He was attracted to a woman you might have caught sight of at the chateau, very clever, but strict, taciturn, rather difficult and very unforgiving. One day, she said to him: 'Either you love me more than you love gambling, in which case give me your word of honour that you'll never gamble again, or you love gambling more than me, in which case you can stop telling me how much you love me and gamble as much as you like.' Desglands swore on his honour that he'd never gamble again. 'No matter how large or small the stakes are?' 'No matter how large or small the stakes are.' They'd been living together for twenty years at the chateau which you know when Desglands was summoned to town on important business. Unfortunately for him, he ran into an old gambling crony at his notary's who dragged him off for a bite to eat in a low gaming-house where in one session he lost everything he owned. His mistress was inflexible. She was wealthy, she made Desglands a modest allowance, and said goodbye to him for ever.","That story will be for the road. The other one is short. He made his fortune gambling. Then he attached himself to a woman whom you might have seen in his château, an intelligent woman, but serious, taciturn, unconventional and hard. This woman told him one day: ‘Either you love me better than you love gambling, in which case you will give me your word of honour that you will never gamble again, or you love gambling better than me, in which case you will never speak to me again of love and gamble as much as you want.’ Desglands gave his word of honour that he would never gamble again. ‘No matter how big or small the stakes?’ ‘No matter how big or small.’ They had been living together in the château which you know for around ten years when Desglands, having been called to town on business, had the misfortune to meet at his lawyer’s one of his old gambling cronies who dragged him off to dinner in a gambling den, where he lost everything he owned in a single sitting. His mistress was unyielding. She was rich and gave Desglands a small pension and left him for ever."

"Jacques ajouta : « Le chirurgien alla retrouver mes hôtes, les prévint de notre arrangement, et un moment après, l’homme, la femme et les enfants se rassemblèrent autour de mon lit avec un air serein ; ce furent des questions sans fin sur ma santé et sur mon genou, des éloges sur le chirurgien, leur compère et sa femme, des souhaits à perte de vue, la plus belle affabilité, un intérêt ! un empressement à me servir ! Cependant le chirurgien ne leur avait pas dit que j’avais quelque argent, mais ils connaissaient l’homme ; il me prenait chez lui, et ils le savaient. Je payai ce que je devais à ces gens ; je fis aux enfants de petites largesses que leur père et mère ne laissèrent pas longtemps entre leurs mains. C’était le matin. L’hôte partit pour s’en aller aux champs, l’hôtesse prit sa hotte sur ses épaules et s’éloigna ; les enfants, attristés et mécontents d’avoir été spoliés, disparurent, et quand il fut question de me tirer de mon grabat, de me vêtir et de m’arranger sur mon brancard, il ne se trouva personne que le docteur, qui se mit à crier à tue-tête et que personne n’entendit.","Jacques added: “The surgeon went to find my hosts, informed them of our arrangement, and a moment later, the man, the woman and the children gathered around my bed with a serene air; there were endless questions about my health and my knee, praise for the surgeon, their friend and his wife, wishes as far as the eye could see, the most beautiful affability, an interest! an eagerness to serve me! However, the surgeon had not told them that I had any money, but they knew the man; he took me to his house, and they knew it. I paid what I owed these people; I gave the children small gifts that their father and mother did not leave for long in their hands. It was morning. The host left to go to the fields, the hostess took her basket on her shoulders and went away; the children, saddened and displeased at having been robbed, disappeared, and when it was a question of getting me out of my pallet, of dressing me and of getting myself on my stretcher, no one was found but the doctor, who screaming loudly and no one heard.","Jacques added: The surgeon rejoined my host and his wife, told them about our arrangement, and the next moment the husband, his wife, and their children had all gathered round my bed looking very cheerful. They asked endless questions about how I felt and how my knee was. They were generous in their praise of their friend the surgeon and his wife. They expressed their good wishes till good wishes were coming out of my ears. They were all smiles, they took such an interest! They couldn't say how happy they'd be to do whatever they could for me! In the meantime, the surgeon hadn't mentioned the fact that I had a little money, but they knew him of old: he was taking me to stay with him and they knew what that meant. I paid the man and wife what I owed and gave the children a little something which their father and mother immediately took off them. It was morning. The husband left to go to the fields, the wife put her wicker basket on her back and went her way, and the children, surly and resentful at having been deprived of what was theirs, disappeared. So when it came to getting me out of bed, dressing me, and settling me on a stretcher, there was no one left except the doctor, who began yelling his head off. Not that there was anyone to hear.","Jacques added: The surgeon went off to find my hosts and tell them of our arrangement and the next moment the peasant, his wife and the children gathered around my bed all looking happy and relieved. There were endless questions on my state of health and about my knee, praise for the surgeon their friend and his wife, endless good wishes, the most friendly affability, and what solicitude and zeal to serve me. The surgeon had not, however, told them that I had a little money, but they knew the man. He was taking me into his house and they knew what that meant. I paid these people what I owed them and I gave the children small presents which their mother and father did not leave in their hands for long. It was morning.

"En ce cas, nous revoilà chez le chirurgien ; et il était écrit là-haut que nous y reviendrions. Le docteur, sa femme et ses enfants se concertèrent si bien pour épuiser ma bourse par toutes sortes de petites rapines, qu’ils y eurent bientôt réussi. La guérison de mon genou paraissait bien avancée sans l’être, la plaie était refermée à peu de chose près, je pouvais sortir à l’aide d’une béquille, et il me restait encore dix-huit francs. Pas de gens qui aiment plus à parler que les bègues, pas de gens qui aiment plus à marcher que les boiteux. Un jour d’automne, une après-dîner qu’il faisait beau, je projetai une longue course ; du village que j’habitais au village voisin, il y avait environ deux lieues.","In that case, we are back at the surgeon; and it was written up there that we would come back. The doctor, his wife and his children concerted so well to exhaust my purse with all sorts of little plunders that they soon succeeded. The healing of my knee seemed well advanced without being it, the wound was almost closed, I could go out with the help of a crutch, and I still had eighteen francs left. No people who love to talk more than stutterers, no people who love to walk more than lame people. One autumn day, one fine afternoon after dinner, I planned a long run; from the village where I lived to the neighboring village, there were about two leagues.","In that case we're back at the surgeon's, and so it was, after all, written on high that we would be. The doctor, his wife, and his children joined forces so effectively to empty my purse by dipping their sticky fingers into it, that they all but succeeded in no time at all. My knee seemed to be coming along nicely, though it wasn't really. The wound had almost healed up, I could go out with the help of crutches, and I still had eighteen francs left. Now no one likes talking more than people who stammer, and no one likes walking more than a man with a limp. One autumn day, it was a fine afternoon, I decided to go for a longish stroll. It was about eight or nine miles from the village where I was staying to the next.","In that case here we are again at the surgeon’s – and it was written up above that we’d return there. The surgeon, along with his wife and children, made such concerted efforts to empty my purse by all sorts of little tricks that they soon succeeded.

"M. le marquis en trouva pourtant une assez bizarre pour lui tenir rigueur. Elle s’appelait Mme de La Pommeraye. C’était une veuve qui avait des mœurs, de la naissance, de la fortune et de la hauteur. M. des Arcis rompit avec toutes ses connaissances, s’attacha uniquement à Mme de La Pommeraye, lui fit sa cour avec la plus grande assiduité, tâcha par tous les sacrifices imaginables de lui prouver qu’il l’aimait, lui proposa même de l’épouser ; mais cette femme avait été si malheureuse avec un premier mari qu’elle… (Madame ? – Qu’est-ce ? – La clef du coffre à l’avoine ? – Voyez au clou, et si elle n’y est pas, voyez au coffre.) qu’elle aurait mieux aimé s’exposer à toutes sortes de malheurs qu’au danger d’un second mariage.","Monsieur le Marquis, however, found one sufficiently bizarre to hold it against him. Her name was Madame de La Pommeraye. She was a widow of character, birth, fortune, and loftiness. M. des Arcis broke with all his acquaintances, became attached only to Madame de La Pommeraye, paid court to her with the greatest assiduity, tried by all imaginable sacrifices to prove to her that he loved her, even proposed to marry him; but this woman had been so unhappy with a first husband that she... (Madame? - What is it? - The key to the oatmeal chest? - Look at the nail, and if it isn't there, see in the safe.) that she would rather have exposed herself to all sorts of misfortunes than to the danger of a second marriage.","Even so, the Marquis found one woman sufficiently out of the ordinary to resist his advances. Madame de La Pommeraye was her name. She was a widow who lived by strict principles, was well born and possessed of wealth and a forthright manner. Monsieur des Arcis broke with all his acquaintance, ignored everyone except her, paid court with the greatest assiduity, made all the sacrifices conceivable to prove that he loved her. He even proposed marriage. But the widow had been so unhappy with her first husband that... 'Madame?' ' What?' 'Where's the key to the bin where you keep the oats?' ' Look on the nail. If it's not there, try the lid of the bin.' ... with her first husband that she would have sooner have exposed herself to the most horrible dangers than to the perils of a second marriage.","The Marquis managed, however, to find one woman peculiar enough to resist his advances. Her name was Mme de La Pommeraye. She was a widow of high moral character, high birth, good breeding, wealth and haughtiness. Monsieur des Arcis broke off with all his other acquaintances and devoted himself exclusively to Mme de La Pommeraye. He courted her with the greatest possible assiduity, attempted by every sacrifice imaginable to show her that he loved her and even proposed to her. But this woman had been so unhappy with a first husband that she… ‘Madame!’ ‘What is it?’ ‘The key to the oat bin?’ ‘See if it’s on the nail. If it’s not there look in the lock.’ … that she would rather expose herself to any kind of misery than the danger of a second marriage."

"– Allez, vous êtes folle ; vous avez encore une vingtaine d’années de jolis péchés à faire : n’y manquez pas ; ensuite vous vous en repentirez, et vous irez vous en vanter aux pieds du prêtre, si cela vous convient… Mais voilà une conversation d’un tour bien sérieux ; votre imagination se noircit furieusement, et c’est l’effet de cette abominable solitude où vous vous êtes renfoncée. Croyez-moi, rappelez au plus tôt le petit comte, vous ne verrez plus ni diable, ni enfer, et vous serez charmante comme auparavant. Vous craignez que je vous le reproche si nous nous raccommodons jamais ; mais d’abord nous ne nous raccommoderons peut-être pas ; et par une appréhension bien ou mal fondée, vous vous privez du plaisir le plus doux ; et, en vérité, l’honneur de valoir mieux que moi ne vaut pas ce sacrifice.","“Come on, you're mad; you have another twenty years of pretty sins to commit: do not miss them; then you will repent of it, and you will go and brag about it at the feet of the priest, if that suits you. your imagination blackens furiously, and it is the effect of this abominable solitude in which you have retreated. Believe me, call the little Count back as soon as possible, you will no longer see devil or hell, and you will be charming as before. You are afraid that I will reproach you for it if we ever reconcile; but at first we may not be reconciled; and by a well-founded or ill-founded apprehension, you deprive yourself of the sweetest pleasure; and, in truth, the honor of being better than I is not worth the sacrifice.","'Come, you've taken leave of your senses. You still have twenty years of delicious sinning ahead of you. Don't waste the opportunity. You can repent afterwards and flaunt it all at the feet of some priest, if you've a mind to... But this conversation is taking a serious turn. Your head is filling with dark, brooding nonsense, it's the effect of the damned solitary life you insist on leading. If you want my advice, you'll summon the Count to return at once, you'll stop seeing hell and damnation everywhere, and you will revert to your former, charming self. Perhaps you are afraid I will hold your past against you if we ever reconcile our differences. But we may never be reconciled and then you will have deprived yourself of the sweetest pleasures in life, and all for fears which may or may not be real. To be perfectly frank, the honour of being my moral superior is not worth the sacrifice.'","‘Come on, you are mad. You’ve got another twenty or so years of happy sinning ahead of you. Don’t miss out on it. After that you will be able to repent, and you can go and parade your repentance at the feet of a priest if that is what you want… But this is a very serious conversation. Your imagination is becoming terribly morbid and it is because of this dreadful solitude you have driven yourself into. Believe me, call back the little count as soon as possible and you will see no more devil or hell and you will be as charming as you were before. You are afraid that I will reproach you for it if ever we take up again. But in the first place, we may never be reconciled, and because of your apprehension which may or may not be well founded you are depriving yourself of the most delightful of pleasures. In all honesty, the merit of being morally superior to me is not worth the sacrifice.’"

I noticed a rather singular thing; it is that there are hardly any moral maxims which could not be made into a medical aphorism, and reciprocally few medical aphorisms which could not be made into a moral maxim.","That is as true of moral states as it is of physical states. I have observed a very odd phenomenon, which is that there's scarcely a single moral dictum that can't be turned into a medical saw and, conversely, few medical saws that can't be converted into a moral dictum.","Which is true in matters moral as well as physical.

Jacques et son maître avaient atteint le gite où ils avaient la nuit à passer. Il était tard ; la porte de la ville était fermée, et ils avaient été obligés de s’arrêter dans le faubourg. Là, j’entends un vacarme… – Vous entendez ! Vous n’y étiez pas ; il ne s’agit pas de vous. – Il est vrai. Eh bien ! Jacques… son maître… On entend un vacarme effroyable. Je vois deux hommes… – Vous ne voyez rien ; il ne s’agit pas de vous, vous n’y étiez pas. – Il est vrai. Il y avait deux hommes à table, causant assez tranquillement à la porte de la chambre qu’ils occupaient ; une femme, les deux poings sur les côtés, leur vomissait un torrent d’injures, et Jacques essayait d’apaiser cette femme, qui n’écoutait non plus ses remontrances pacifiques que les deux personnages à qui elle s’adressait ne faisaient attention à ses invectives. « Allons, ma bonne, lui disait Jacques, patience, remettez-vous ; voyons, de quoi s’agit-il ?

I see two men… – You see nothing; it's not about you, you wasn't there. - It is true. There were two men at the table, talking quietly enough at the door of the room they occupied; a woman, her two fists at her sides, vomited a torrent of insults at them, and Jacques tried to appease this woman, who no more listened to her peaceful remonstrances than the two personages to whom she was addressing paid no attention to them. his insults. “Come on, my dear,” said Jacques to her, “be patient, recover; see, what is it?

Not a clue, on my honour. What business did they have wherever it was they were going to? Anything you like. Do you think Jacques's Master told everybody his business? But whatever it was, it didn't take longer than a fortnight. Did it go well? Did it go badly? I don't know that either, but Jacques's sore throat cleared up as a result of two medicines which he detested: diet and rest.","Jacques and his master spent yet another night on the road. They were too close to the end of their journey for Jacques to take up the story of his loves again, and anyway his sore throat was far from better. The following day they arrived. – Where? On my word of honour, I don’t know. – And what did they have to do at wherever they were going to? Whatever you like. Do you think that Jacques’ master told everyone his business? Whatever it was, they did not need to stay for more than two weeks. – Did it end well or did it end badly? That is what I still don’t know. Jacques’ sore throat cleared up because of two cures which he had an aversion to: diet and rest."

We must not be too surprised they should be so careful: it would only take a rumour to alienate a good number of charitable souls and deprive them of the help on which they depend. It seems, Marquis, that a high price is demanded by those who do good works.","I thought Monsieur le Marquis knew me a little better than that. Your love used to see good points in me.

"Le marquis avoua qu’il le pensait comme elle, et lui demanda la permission de faire une dernière tentative ; c’était d’assurer des rentes considérables sur les deux têtes, de partager sa fortune avec les deux femmes, et de les rendre propriétaires à vie d’une de ses maisons à la ville, et d’une autre à la campagne. « Faites, lui dit la marquise ; je n’interdis que la violence ; mais croyez, mon ami, que l’honneur et la vertu, quand elle est vraie, n’ont point de prix aux yeux de ceux qui ont le bonheur de les posséder.

By this he meant settling a large sum on both women, sharing his fortune with them, and giving them title, for as long as they should live, to two houses which he owned, one in town and the other in the country. 'Certainly you may try,' said the Marquise. ' I draw the line only at violence.

Your new offer will succeed no better than the others. I would stake my life on it.

"Tu pourrais bien avoir raison… Il est impossible de connaître un homme plus doux, plus civil, plus honnête, plus poli, plus humain, plus compatissant, plus désintéressé que M. de Merval. Mon âge de majorité et ma solvabilité bien constatée, M. de Merval prit un air tout à fait affectueux et triste et nous dit avec le ton de la componction qu’il était au désespoir ; qu’il avait été dans cette même matinée obligé de secourir un de ses amis pressé des besoins les plus urgents et qu’il était tout à fait à sec. Puis s’adressant à moi, il ajouta : « Monsieur, n’ayez point de regret de ne pas être venu plus tôt ; j’aurais été affligé de vous refuser, mais je l’aurais fait : l’amitié passe avant tout… »","You could well be right… It is impossible to know a gentler, more civil, more honest, more polite, more humane, more compassionate, more disinterested man than M. de Merval. My age of majority and my well-established solvency, M. de Merval put on a very affectionate and sad air and told us with a tone of compunction that he was in despair; that he had been obliged that very morning to help one of his friends who was in dire need and that he was completely exhausted. Then addressing me, he added: “Monsieur, do not regret not having come sooner; I would have been distressed to refuse you, but I would have done it: friendship comes first…”","You could be right... But you couldn't wish to meet a kinder, more courteous, honest, civil, human, sympathetic, and disinterested man than Monsieur de Merval. When he was satisfied I had reached my majority and was solvent, Monsieur de Merval looked very concerned and pained. He told us gravely that he was very sorry but that very morning he had been forced to oblige a friend of his who was in the direst straits. As a consequence, he was completely cleaned out. He then turned to me and added: 'Sir, you needn't regret you did not come to see me sooner. I would have been sorry to turn you down, but I would have done it. Loyalty to one's friends must come first...' We were all quite speechless.","You may well be right… You couldn’t meet a man more kind, more civil, more honest, more polite, more human, more tender-hearted or more disinterested than M. de Merval. Having established to his satisfaction that I was not a minor and that I was solvent, M. de Merval looked positively affectionate and sad and said to us in a tone of deep compassion that he was profoundly sorry but he had been obliged that very morning to help one of his friends, pressed by the most urgent needs, and that he was absolutely without funds. Then, turning to me, he added: ‘Monsieur, do not regret not having come here earlier. I would have been distressed to refuse you, but I would have done so. Friendship goes before everything else.’"

"– Il est vrai, et voilà ce qui me pèse ; c’est un reproche qui met le comble à un beaucoup plus important que je me fais. Est-ce que vous ne vous apercevez pas que je n’ai plus la même gaieté ? J’ai perdu l’appétit ; je ne bois et je ne mange que par raison ; je ne saurais dormir. Nos sociétés les plus intimes me déplaisent. La nuit, je m’interroge et je me dis : Est-ce qu’il est moins aimable ? Non. Est-ce que vous auriez à vous en plaindre ? Non. Auriez-vous à lui reprocher quelques liaisons suspectes ? Non. Est-ce que sa tendresse pour vous est diminuée ? Non. Pourquoi, votre ami étant le même, votre cœur est-il donc changé ? car il l’est : vous ne pouvez vous le cacher ; vous ne l’attendez plus avec la même impatience ; vous n’avez plus le même plaisir à le voir ; cette inquiétude quand il tardait à revenir ; cette douce émotion au bruit de sa voiture, quand on l’annonçait, quand il paraissait, vous ne l’éprouvez plus.","“It is true, and that is what weighs me down; it is a reproach which puts the finishing touch to a much more important thing than I make to myself. Don't you see that I no longer have the same gaiety? I lost my appetite; I only drink and eat for reason; I cannot sleep. Our most intimate societies displease me. At night, I wonder and I say to myself: Is he less lovable? No. Would you have to complain about it? No. Would you blame him for a few suspicious liaisons? No. Is his tenderness for you diminished? No. Why, your friend being the same, is your heart changed then? for it is: you cannot conceal it from yourselves; you no longer await it with the same impatience; you no longer have the same pleasure in seeing him; this worry when he was late coming back; that sweet emotion at the noise of his carriage, when it was announced, when it appeared, you no longer feel it.","'It was, and that is what hangs heavy on me. The weight of it makes the burden of my guilt complete. Have you not noticed that I am not as cheerful in spirit as I was formerly? I have lost my appetite, I eat and drink only because I tell myself I should, and I cannot sleep. I find the company of our closest friends irksome. At night, I lie awake and wonder: Has he grown less adorable? No. Have you any complaint to make against him? No. Have you cause to reproach him for placing his affections elsewhere? No. Does he love you less? No. Then why is it that if the man who loves you is the same, your feelings have altered? For they have, and you cannot hide the fact. You no longer wait for him to come with the same impatience, you no longer take the same pleasure in seeing him, or experience the old anxiety when he is late returning, that thrill of pleasure when you hear the sound of his carriage or his name when he is announced and appears at last—you no longer feel any of these things.'","‘That is true, and that is what is worrying me. That is a reproach which is greater than the one I have to make myself. Can you not see that I am no longer so happy? I have lost my appetite. I only eat and drink because I make myself. I cannot sleep. Our most intimate gatherings displease me. At night I question myself and ask: Is he any the less kind? No. Have you anything to complain about? No. Do you have to reproach him for suspect liaisons? No. Has his love for you diminished? No. How is it that if your friend is the same your heart has changed? For it has and you can’t hide the fact. You no longer await him with the same impatience. You no longer feel the same pleasure in seeing him, or experience the same anxiety when he is late. That tender pleasure, to hear the noise of his carriage, to hear his name announced, to see him finally appear – you no longer feel any of it.’"

I lost my captain, I'm sorry; and you detach from me, like a parrot, a shred of the consolation of a man or a woman to another woman who has lost her lover.","Sir, that's very fine, but what's it got to do with anything? I've lost my Captain, I'm grief-stricken and you come out, like a parrot, with a slice of funeral oration written by some man or other, or maybe by a woman to another woman who has just lost the man she loved.","Master, that’s all very nice, but what the devil do you mean by it?

"Mme de La Pommeraye ajouta : « Je ne vous verrai point chez vous ; je ne suis pas digne du commerce d’aussi saintes femmes ; mais n’en ayez aucune inquiétude : vous viendrez ici clandestinement quelquefois, et nous nous dédommagerons, en petit comité, de votre régime pénitent. Mais, tout en jouant la dévotion, n’allez pas vous en empêtrer. Quant aux dépenses de votre petit ménage, c’est mon affaire. Si mon projet réussit, vous n’aurez plus besoin de moi ; s’il manque sans qu’il y ait de votre faute, je suis assez riche pour vous assurer un sort honnête et meilleur que l’état que vous m’aurez sacrifié. Mais surtout soumission, soumission absolue, illimitée à mes volontés, sans quoi je ne réponds de rien pour le présent, et ne m’engage à rien pour l’avenir. »","Madame de La Pommeraye added: “I shall not see you at home; I am not worthy of the commerce of such holy women; but do not worry about it: you will come here clandestinely sometimes, and we will compensate ourselves, in small committee, for your penitent regime. But, while playing devotion, don't get entangled in it. As for the expenses of your little household, that is my business. If my project succeeds, you will no longer need me; if it fails through no fault of yours, I am rich enough to ensure you an honest fate and better than the state you will have sacrificed for me. But above all submission, absolute submission, unlimited to my will, without which I answer for nothing for the present, and commit myself to nothing for the future. »","Madame de La Pommeraye added: 'I will not come to call on you, for I am not fit company for two such saintly ladies. But don't worry. You may come here from time to time, secretly, and the three of us shall more than make up for your life of penance. But take good care that in the process of faking the symptoms of religion you do not catch the disease. As for your modest household expenses, I shall take care of them. If my plan succeeds, you will soon cease to have need of me. If it fails through no fault of yours, I am rich enough to provide you with a good future, one that is far better than the life you gave up for me. But the key word is obedience, absolute, unlimited obedience to my will. Without it, I refuse to answer for the present and make no promises for the future.'","Madame de La Pommeraye added: ‘I will not come to see you at your house. I am not worthy to be the guest of such devout women. But do not worry. You will come here secretly sometimes and we will privately find ways of making up for the austerity of your penitential regime. But, however much you play at devotion, you must not let yourselves become seriously caught up in it. As for the expense of your little household, I will see to all that. If my plan succeeds, you will no longer have need of me. If it goes wrong through no fault of yours, I am rich enough to ensure that you have an honest future, better than the life you have sacrificed for me. But above all I require submission, absolute, unlimited submission, to my will, without which I will guarantee nothing for the moment and make no promises for the future.’"

"Que cette aventure ne deviendrait-elle pas entre mes mains, s’il me prenait en fantaisie de vous désespérer ! Je donnerais de l’importance à cette femme ; j’en ferais la nièce d’un curé du village voisin ; j’ameuterais les paysans de ce village ; je me préparerais des combats et des amours ; car enfin cette paysanne était belle sous le linge. Jacques et son maître s’en étaient aperçus ; l’amour n’a pas toujours attendu une occasion aussi séduisante. Pourquoi Jacques ne deviendrait-il pas amoureux une seconde fois ? Pourquoi ne serait-il pas une seconde fois le rival et même le rival préféré de son maître ? – Est-ce que le cas lui était déjà arrivé ? – Toujours des questions !

I would give importance to this woman; I would make her the niece of a priest in the neighboring village; I would stir up the peasants of this village; I would prepare myself for fights and loves; for after all this peasant woman was beautiful under her linen. Jacques and his master had noticed this; love has not always waited for such an alluring occasion. Why wouldn't Jacques fall in love a second time? Why shouldn't he be his master's rival and even his master's favorite rival for a second time? ""Has this happened to him before?"" - Always questions! So you don't want Jacques to continue the story of his loves? Once and for all, explain yourself; will it please you, will it not please you? If it will please you, let's put the peasant woman back behind her driver, let them go and come back to our two travelers. This time it was Jacques who spoke and said to his master:","What couldn't I make of this episode if the fancy took me to reduce you to tears! I'd make the woman someone important: I'd make her the niece of the cure of the nearest village, I'd rouse all the men in the parish , I'd get ready to show lots of fighting and sex, for, truth to tell, the girl was very shapely under those nether garments, as Jacques and his Master had noticed. Love never wanted a better opportunity! Why shouldn't Jacques fall in love a second time? Why shouldn't he turn out a second time to be the rival—even the preferred rival—of his Master? * You mean it had happened once already? You're always asking questions! Don't you want Jacques to go on with the tale of his loves? You'd better let me know, once and for all: is that or is that not what you would like? If it's what you want, let's get the girl back up on the horse behind the surgeon, send them on their way, and return to our two travellers. This time it was Jacques who spoke. He said to his Master: Jacques. That's how it goes.","What might this little incident not become in my hands if I took it into my head to reduce you to despair. I could make this woman somebody important. I could make all the peasants come running. I could bring in stories of love and strife, because, after all, underneath her petticoats this peasant girl had a nice little body, as Jacques and his master had noticed. Love hasn’t always waited for so seductive an opportunity. Why shouldn’t Jacques fall in love a second time? Why shouldn’t he be, for a second time, his master’s rival – even his preferred rival? – Had that happened to him before? Always questions! Do you not want Jacques to continue with the story of his loves then? Once and for all, tell me: Would that give you pleasure, or would it not give you pleasure? If that would give you pleasure, then let us put the peasant girl back up behind the surgeon, allow them to carry on their way, and return to our two travellers.

"« Il vient un moment où presque toutes les jeunes filles et les jeunes garçons tombent dans la mélancolie ; ils sont tourmentés d’une inquiétude vague qui se promène sur tout, et qui ne trouve rien qui la calme. Ils cherchent la solitude ; ils pleurent ; le silence des cloîtres les touche ; l’image de la paix qui semble régner dans les maisons religieuses les séduit. Ils prennent pour la voix de Dieu qui les appelle à lui les premiers efforts d’un tempérament qui se développe : et c’est précisément lorsque la nature les sollicite, qu’ils embrassent un genre de vie contraire au vœu de la nature. L’erreur ne dure pas ; l’expression de la nature devient plus claire ; on la reconnaît, et l’être séquestré tombe dans les regrets, la langueur, les vapeurs, la folie ou le désespoir… » Tel fut le préambule du marquis des Arcis. « Dégoûté du monde à l’âge de dix-sept ans, Richard (c’est le nom de mon secrétaire) se sauva de la maison paternelle et prit l’habit de prémontré.","“There comes a time when almost all young girls and boys fall into melancholy; they are tormented by a vague uneasiness that roams over everything and finds nothing to calm it. They seek solitude; they are crying ; the silence of the cloisters touches them; the image of peace that seems to reign in religious houses seduces them. They take for the voice of God who calls them to himself the first efforts of a temperament which develops: and it is precisely when nature solicits them that they embrace a mode of life contrary to the will of nature. Error does not last; the expression of nature becomes clearer; one recognizes it, and the sequestered being falls into regrets, languor, vapors, madness or despair…” Such was the preamble of the Marquis des Arcis. ""Disgusted with the world at the age of seventeen, Richard (that's the name of my secretary) fled from his father's house and took the habit of a Premonstratensian.","'There comes a time when every girl and every boy turns melancholy. They are troubled by a vague unease which colours everything and is not to be assuaged. They want to be on their own, they weep, the silence of cloisters affects them deeply, they are drawn to the image of peace which seems to rule convents and monasteries. They make the error of hearing the voice of God in the first stirrings of developing adulthood, and it is at the very moment when nature presses them hardest that they embrace a life which denies the voice of nature. The error does not last. Nature speaks more clearly, it is recognized, and the cloistered captive is overcome by regrets, languor, vapours, madness, or despair.' * Thus spake the Marquis des Arcis by way of preamble. 'Alienated from the world at the age of seventeen, Richard—such was the name of my secretary—fled his father's house and donned the robe of a Premonstrant.'","There comes a moment when nearly all young girls and young boys become melancholic. They are disturbed by a vague uneasiness which extends to everything and can find no consolation. They look for solitude. They weep. The silence of the cloister moves them and the image of peace which seems to reign in religious houses seduces them. They mistake the first movements of their developing emotions for the voice of God calling them and it is at the precise moment when nature is calling to them that they embrace a life which is contrary to the laws of nature. Their mistake does not last. The voice of nature becomes clearer and is heard and the prisoner falls into regrets, listlessness, swooning, madness or despair.’ That was how the Marquis des Arcis started. ‘At the age of seventeen, disgusted with the world, Richard left his father’s house to take the habit of a Premonstratensian.’"

"Un jour Desglands invita à dîner la belle veuve avec quelques gentilshommes d’alentour. Le règne de Desglands était sur son déclin ; et parmi ses convives il y en avait un vers lequel son inconstance commençait à la pencher. Ils étaient à table, Desglands et son rival placés à côté l’un de l’autre et en face de la belle veuve. Desglands employait tout ce qu’il avait d’esprit pour animer la conversation ; il adressait à la veuve les propos les plus galants ; mais elle, distraite, n’entendait rien, et tenait les yeux attachés sur son rival. Desglands avait un œuf frais à la main ; un mouvement convulsif, occasionné par la jalousie, le saisit, il serre les poings, et voilà l’œuf chassé de sa coque et répandu sur le visage de son voisin. Celui-ci fit un geste de la main. Desglands lui prend le poignet, l’arrête, et lui dit à l’oreille : « Monsieur, je le tiens pour reçu… » Il se fait un profond silence ; la belle veuve se trouve mal. Le repas fut triste et court. Au sortir de table, elle fit appeler Desglands et son rival dans un appartement séparé ; tout ce qu’une femme peut faire décemment pour les réconcilier, elle le fit ; elle supplia, elle pleura, elle s’évanouit, mais tout de bon ; elle serrait les mains à Desglands, elle tournait ses yeux inondés de larmes sur l’autre. Elle disait à celui-ci : « Et vous m’aimez !… » à celui-là : « Et vous m’avez aimée… » à tous les deux : « Et vous voulez me perdre, et vous voulez me rendre la fable, l’objet de la haine et du mépris de toute la province ! Quel que soit celui des deux qui ôte la vie à son ennemi, je ne le reverrai jamais ; il ne peut être ni mon ami ni mon amant ; je lui voue une haine qui ne finira qu’avec ma vie… » Puis elle retombait en défaillance, et en défaillant elle disait : « Cruels, tirez vos épées et enfoncez-les dans mon sein ; si en expirant je vous vois embrassés, j’expirerai sans regret !… » Desglands et son rival restaient immobiles ou la secoueraient, et quelques pleurs s’échappaient de leurs yeux. Cependant il fallut se séparer. On remit la belle veuve chez elle plus morte que vive.","One day Desglands invited the beautiful widow to dinner with some gentlemen of the neighborhood. Desglands' reign was on the wane; and among her guests there was one towards whom her inconstancy was beginning to lean her. They were at table, Desglands and his rival seated side by side and facing the beautiful widow. Desglands did all he could to liven up the conversation; he addressed the most gallant remarks to the widow; but she, distracted, heard nothing, and kept her eyes fixed on her rival. Desglands had a fresh egg in his hand; a convulsive movement, caused by jealousy, seizes him, he clenches his fists, and behold the egg driven from its shell and spread on the face of its neighbor. He waved his hand. Desglands takes his wrist, stops him, and whispers in his ear: “Monsieur, I take it for granted…” There is a profound silence; the beautiful widow is ill. The meal was sad and short. On leaving the table, she had Desglands and his rival summoned to a separate apartment; all that a woman can decently do to reconcile them, she did; she begged, she wept, she fainted, but all good; she shook hands with Desglands, she turned her tear-stained eyes on the other. She said to this one: ""And you love me!..."" to that one: ""And you loved me..."" to both: ""And you want to lose me, and you want to give me back the fable, the object of the hatred and contempt of the whole province! Whichever of the two takes the life of his enemy, I shall never see him again; he can be neither my friend nor my lover; I have a hatred for him that will only end with my life…” Then she fell back into weakness, and in weakness she said: “Cruel ones, draw your swords and plunge them into my bosom; if while expiring I see you kissed, I shall expire without regret!...” Desglands and his rival remained motionless or shook her, and a few tears escaped from their eyes. However, we had to separate. The beautiful widow was returned to her home, more dead than alive.","One day, Desglands invited the divine widow to dinner together with a few gentlemen who lived nearby. Desglands's star was beginning to wane and among the guests was a man who was beginning to catch her roving eye. They were at table, with Desglands and his rival sitting next to each other directly opposite the widow. Desglands was racking his brains to make the conversation sparkle. He said the most gallant things to her, but her mind seemed elsewhere. She didn't hear anything he said but kept her eyes fixed on his rival. Desglands was holding a fresh egg. A spasm of anger prompted by jealousy shook him, he clenched his fist, and the contents of the egg burst from its shell and spurted all over his neighbour's face. The man was about to raise his hand but Desglands grabbed his wrist, stopped him, and whispered: 'Sir, I consider your challenge to have been issued.' This was followed by a profound silence, and the widow felt unwell. The meal was gloomy and short. As they got up from table, she called Desglands and his rival into a separate chamber. Everything a woman could have decently done to reconcile them, she did. She begged, she wept, she swooned quite genuinely. She pressed Desglands's hands and looked at the other man with tear-filled eyes. To the latter, she said: 'But you love me!...' And to the former: 'But you loved me once!...' Then to the pair of them:'... and you are intent on ruining me, you mean to make me the talk, the scandal of the whole county, hated and despised by all! Whichever one of you kills his opponent, I shall never speak to him again. He is not a man I can have either as friend or lover, and I shall feel nothing but the deepest loathing for him until the day I die.' Whereupon she fainted away again, and as she fainted she cried: 'Unfeeling brutes! Draw your swords and plunge them into my breast! If as I die I see you embrace each other, then I shall die without regret!' Desglands and his rival stood stock-still, or perhaps they tried to revive her, and both had tears in their eyes. But the time came for them to go their separate ways. The beautiful widow was taken home more dead than alive.","One day Desglands invited the beautiful widow to dinner, together with a few neighbouring gentlemen. The reign of Desglands was in its decline and among his guests there was one towards whom the inconstant widow was beginning to be attracted. At table, Desglands and his rival were sitting next to each other opposite the beautiful widow. Desglands used all his wit to enliven the conversation. He addressed the most gallant remarks to the widow but she was distracted, paid no attention to him and continued to stare at his rival. Desglands was holding a fresh egg in his hand when he was overcome by a convulsive movement occasioned by jealousy. He clenched his fist and the next moment there was the egg squeezed from its shell and plastered all over the face of his neighbour, who made a movement with his hand. Desglands grabbed his wrist, stopped him and said in his ear: ‘Monsieur, I consider the blow to have been struck.’ Then there was a profound silence. The beautiful widow felt ill. The meal was sad and brief. On leaving table the widow called Desglands and his rival into a separate room. She did everything which a woman could decently do to reconcile them. She begged, she cried, she fainted, quite genuinely. She clasped Desglands’ hands, she turned to his rival with tears in her eyes. To him she said: ‘You love me.’ To the other she said: ‘And you have loved me.’ To both of them: ‘And you want to ruin me, to make me the scandal of the whole province, hated and despised by all! Whichever of the two of you takes the life of his enemy, I will never see him again. He can be neither my friend nor my lover and I vow that I will hate him until my dying day.’ Then she swooned again and as she swooned she said: ‘ Cruel men. Draw your swords and plunge them into my breast. If I see your arms around each other when I die, I will die without regret.’ Desglands and his rival stood motionless or helped her and a few tears fell from their eyes. The time finally came to part and the beautiful widow was taken back to her house more dead than alive."

"Je prends la serpe, et nous allons. Chemin faisant, Suzanne se laissait tomber la tête sur mon épaule, me prenait le menton, me tirait les oreilles, me pinçait les côtés. Nous arrivons. L’endroit était en pente. Suzanne se couche à terre tout de son long à la place la plus élevée, les pieds éloignés l’un de l’autre et les bras passés par dessus la tête. J’étais au dessous d’elle, jouant de la serpe sur le taillis, et Suzanne repliait ses jambes, approchant ses talons de ses fesses ; ses genoux élevés rendaient ses jupons fort courts, et je jouais toujours de la serpe sur le taillis, ne regardant guère où je frappais et frappant souvent à côté. Enfin, Suzanne me dit : « Jacques, est-ce que tu ne finiras pas bientôt ?","I take the sickle, and we go. Along the way, Suzanne dropped her head on my shoulder, took my chin, pulled my ears, pinched my sides. We arrive. The place was on a slope. Suzanne lies down on the ground full length in the highest place, feet far apart and arms crossed over her head. I was below her, playing with the sickle on the copse, and Suzanne was bending her legs, bringing her heels close to her buttocks; her high knees made her petticoats very short, and I always played with the sickle on the copse, hardly looking where I was striking and often striking besides. Finally, Suzanne said to me: ""Jacques, won't you be finishing soon?""","I fetch their billhook and off we go. As we went along, Suzanne allowed her head to rest on my shoulder, stroked my chin, pinched my ears, and tickled me in the ribs. We reach the common, which was on a slope. Suzanne lies down flat at the top of it with her legs spread wide and her arms under her head. I was lower down swinging at the bushes with the billhook. Suzanne bent her legs, drew her heels in close to her body, and her raised knees also raised her skirts. I was still swinging the billhook, though I was not looking at what I was swinging it at, and missing more often than not. Eventually, Suzanne says: 'Jacques, will you be finished soon?' To which I replied:","I took the bill-hook and off we went. On the way Suzanne let her head fall on to my shoulder, tickled my chin, pulled my ears and pinched my sides. We arrived. It was a sloping field. Suzanne stretched herself out at the top of the slope, her arms behind her head, her legs wide apart. I was beneath her cutting on the slope. Suzanne bent her legs drawing her heels up to her thighs. Since her knees were in the air her skirts didn’t come down very far. I was still cutting away on the slope hardly looking where I was cutting and missing most of the time. At last Suzanne spoke: ‘Jacques, you will finish soon, won’t you.’"

And Jacques' master said to the surgeon: ""This is what it is to demonstrate. »","Whereupon, turning round for the purpose of his demonstration, he jostles his passenger, makes her lose her balance, and tips her on to the ground where she lands with one foot caught in the tails of his coat, and her petticoats clean over her head. Jacques dismounts, frees the poor creature's foot, and pulls her petticoats down. Actually, I couldn't say if he started by pulling her petticoats down or by freeing her foot, but if we can judge the state of the woman by the shrieks she uttered, she had hurt herself quite badly. Jacques's master said to the surgeon:","And as he was turning round to demonstrate he pushed his companion, made her lose her balance and threw her to the ground, with one foot caught in his coat tails and her petticoats over her head. Jacques got down, freed the poor creature’s foot and pulled her skirts back down. I don’t know whether he started by pulling her skirts back down or freeing her foot, but, to judge the state of this woman from her screams, she had hurt herself badly. And Jacques’ master said to the surgeon: ‘That’s what comes of demonstrating!…’"

"Je vous entends, lecteur ; voilà, dites-vous, le vrai dénouement du Bourru bienfaisant. Je le pense. J’aurais introduit dans cette pièce, si j’en avais été l’auteur, un personnage qu’on aurait pris pour épisodique, et qui ne l’aurait point été. Ce personnage se serait montré quelquefois, et sa présence aurait été motivée. La première fois il serait venu demander grâce ; mais la crainte d’un mauvais accueil l’aurait fait sortir avant l’arrivée de Géronte. Pressé par l’irruption des huissiers dans sa maison, il aurait eu la seconde fois le courage d’attendre Géronte ; mais celui-ci aurait refusé de le voir. Enfin, je l’aurais amené au dénouement, où il aurait fait exactement le rôle du paysan avec l’aubergiste ; il aurait eu, comme le paysan, une fille qu’il allait placer chez une marchande de modes, un fils qu’il allait retirer des écoles pour entrer en condition ; lui, il se serait déterminé à mendier jusqu’à ce qu’il se fût ennuyé de vivre. On aurait vu le Bourru bienfaisant aux pieds de cet homme ; on aurait entendu le Bourru bienfaisant gourmandé comme il le méritait ; il aurait été forcé de s’adresser à toute la famille qui l’aurait environné, pour fléchir son débiteur et le contraindre à accepter de nouveaux secours. Le Bourru bienfaisant aurait été puni ; il aurait promis de se corriger ; mais dans le moment même il serait revenu à son caractère, en s’impatientant contre les personnages en scène, qui se seraient fait des politesses pour rentrer dans la maison ; il aurait dit brusquement : Que le diable emporte les cérém… Mais il se serait arrêté court au milieu du mot, et, d’un ton radouci, il aurait dit à ses nièces : « Allons, mes nièces ; donnez-moi la main et passons. » – Et pour que ce personnage eût été lié au fond, vous en auriez fait un protégé du neveu de Géronte ? – Fort bien ! – Et ç’aurait été à la prière du neveu que l’oncle aurait prêté son argent ? – À merveille ! – Et ce prêt aurait été un grief de l’oncle contre son neveu ? – C’est cela même : Et le dénouement de cette pièce agréable n’aurait pas été une répétition générale, avec toute la famille en corps, de ce qu’il a fait auparavant avec chacun d’eux en particulier ? – Vous avez raison : Et si je rencontre jamais M. Goldoni, je lui réciterai la scène de l’auberge. – Et vous ferez bien ; il est plus habile homme qu’il ne faut pour en tirer bon parti.","I hear you, reader; here, you say, is the true denouement of Le Bourru bienfaisant. I think so. I would have introduced into this play, if I had been its author, a character who would have been taken for episodic, and who would not have been. This character would have shown himself sometimes, and his presence would have been justified. The first time he would have come to ask for mercy; but the fear of a bad reception would have driven him out before Geronte arrived. Pressed by the irruption of the ushers into his house, he would have had the courage the second time to wait for Géronte; but the latter would have refused to see him. Finally, I would have brought him to the denouement, where he would have played exactly the role of the peasant with the innkeeper; he would have had, like the peasant, a daughter whom he was going to place with a fashion merchant, a son whom he was going to withdraw from school in order to enter a profession; he himself would have determined to beg until he grew bored of living. One would have seen the benevolent Bourru at the feet of this man; we would have heard the benevolent Bourru scolded as he deserved; he would have been forced to address all the family around him, to bend his debtor and compel him to accept new help. The benevolent Bourru would have been punished; he would have promised to correct himself; but at the very moment he would have returned to his character, becoming impatient with the characters on the stage, who would have made courtesies to return to the house; he would have said abruptly: The devil take the cerem… But he would have stopped short in the middle of the word, and, in a softened tone, he would have said to his nieces: “Come on, my nieces; give me your hand and let's go. ""And for this character to have been linked to the background, you would have made him a protege of Geronte's nephew?"" - Very good ! ""And it would have been at the request of the nephew that the uncle would have lent his money?"" - Perfectly ! ""And this loan would have been a grievance of the uncle against his nephew?"" – That’s it: And the denouement of this pleasant play would not have been a general rehearsal, with the whole family in body, of what he did before with each of them in particular? – You are right: And if I ever meet M. Goldoni, I will recite the inn scene to him. “And you will do well; he is a cleverer man than is necessary to make good use of it.","I can hear you, Reader. This, you're saying, is the real denouement of Le Bourru bienfaisantl * I think you're right. Now if I'd been the author of that play, I'd have added a character who would have been called episodic but wouldn't have been. This character would have come on from time to time and there would always be a motive for it. On the first occasion, he comes to ask for more time to pay but, fearing he'll get a dusty answer, goes away again before Geronte arrives. Hard-pressed by the sudden appearance of the bailiffs in his house, he plucks up courage a second time to face Geronte, but Geronte refuses to see him. Finally, I'd have brought him into the denouement where he'd have played exactly the same role as the peasant with the landlord. Like the peasant, he would have a daughter and would be trying to find work for her as an assistant in a dressmaker's shop, and a son he was about to remove from college and put into service. He himself would have made up his mind to live as a beggar until such time as he was sick of life. You'd have seen the kindly curmudgeon fall at this man's feet , you'd have heard him being told home truths as he deserved, he would have been forced to explain himself to his whole family, who now gather round trying to persuade the debtor to yield and accept further help. The man who is both kindness and flint would get his comeuppance, he would promise to change his ways, but at the very moment he promises I'd show him reverting to type by losing his temper with all the characters on the stage who by then would be saying polite goodbyes before taking their leave. Suddenly, he says: 'Devil take all this damned cerem...' But he stops short in the middle of the word and in a kinder tone of voice says to his nieces: 'Come, girls, give me your hand and let's go inside.' And to tie this character into the general situation, you'd make him some sort of dependant or protege of Geronte's nephew? Why, yes! And it would be at the nephew's insistence that the uncle lent the money? Brilliant! And this loan would have been the reason why the uncle had fallen out with his nephew? That's it exactly. And I suppose the climax of this charming little drama would be a general re-enactment with the whole family gathered together of what he had said previously to each of them separately? You're absolutely right. If I ever meet Monsieur Goldoni, I shall recite to him the scene at the inn. Do. He's more than clever enough to make something interesting of it.","I know what you are thinking, Reader, you are thinking that this is the real denouement of the Rough Diamond.30 I believe it is. If I had been the author I would have introduced into this little work a character whom one would have taken as being episodic, but who would, in fact, not have been. This character would have appeared a few times, and some motive would have been given for his appearances. The first time he would have come to ask for grace, but the fear of a hostile welcome would have made him leave before the arrival of Géronte. Pressed by the bailiffs breaking into his house, the second time he would have had the courage to wait for Géronte, but Géronte would have refused to see him. Eventually I would have brought him on at the denouement, where he would have played the same role the peasant did with the innkeeper. Like the peasant he would have had a daughter whom he was going to place with a dressmaker, a son whom he was going to withdraw from school and send into service, and as for him, he would have decided to beg until he became tired of living. We would have seen the Rough Diamond at the feet of this man. We would have heard the Rough Diamond rebuked because he merited it. He would have been obliged to appeal to his whole family around him in order to move his debtor to pity to persuade him to accept fresh help. The Rough Diamond would have been punished. He would have promised to correct himself but at this very moment he would revert to his true character and, losing patience with the characters on stage, who would, by now, be exchanging civilities in order to go back into the house, he would have said brusquely: ‘May the devil take these damned…’ but he would have stopped dead in the middle of the word, and in a softer tone he would have said to his nieces: ‘Come along, girls, take my hand and we’ll go…’ – And in order that this character should be better integrated into the play, you would have made this character a protégé of Géronte’s nephew? Very good. – And it would have been at the nephew’s request that the uncle lent him money? Perfect. – And this loan would have been a bone of contention between uncle and nephew? Exactly that. – And the denouement of this agreeable play, would it not have been a repeat with the whole family in chorus of what he had previously said with each of them individually? You’re right. – Well then, if ever I meet Monsieur Goldoni I will repeat the scene in the inn to him. You would do well there. He’s got more than enough talent to make something of it."

Et je conçus qu’il ne s’agissait pas seulement d’être vrai, mais qu’il fallait encore être plaisant ; et que c’était la raison pour laquelle on dirait à jamais : Qu’allait-il faire dans cette galère ? et que le mot de mon paysan Que faisait-elle à sa porte ? ne passerait pas en proverbe.","I spare you all these things, which you will find in novels, in old comedy and in society.

And I realized that it was not only a question of being true, but that it was also necessary to be pleasant; and that was the reason why we would always say: What was he going to do in this mess? and that the word of my peasant What was she doing at her door? would not pass as a proverb.","I'll spare you such things—you can find stuff like that in novels, in comedies written by the ancients, and in your daily dealings with other people. I mean, when I heard the husband say of his wife: 'But what the devil was she doing standing on the doorstep?' , I was reminded of Moliere's Harpagon when he's talking about his son and says ' But what the devil was he doing on the ship?' * and realized that it's not enough to be true, you have to be amusing too, which is the reason why people will go on saying ' But what the devil was he doing on the ship' forever, while what my character says here, 'But what the devil was she doing standing on the doorstep?', will never become anybody's catch-phrase.

Ce qu’il y a de vrai, c’est que, de quelque endroit qu’il vous plaise de les mettre en route, ils n’eurent pas fait vingt pas que le maître dit à Jacques, après avoir toutefois, selon son usage, pris sa prise de tabac : « Eh bien !

What is true is that, from whatever place you choose to put them on the road, they had not gone twenty paces, which the master said to Jacques, after having however, according to his custom, , took his snuff: “Well!

For although any and all of this might seem possible to you, Jacques did not think so: the only possibility was what was written up there, on high. But what is true is that from whatever location you choose for them to put their best foot forward, they'd not got twenty yards before the Master (who nevertheless, according to his custom, had taken his pinch of snuff) said to Jacques: ' Well now, Jacques, and what about the tale of your loves?'","You are going to say that I am amusing myself and that because I do not know what to do with my two travellers any more, I am throwing myself into allegory, which is the usual recourse of sterile minds. For you I will sacrifice my allegory and all the riches I could draw from it and I will agree with whatever you want, but on condition that you don’t bother me any more about where Jacques and his master spent last night. They may have reached a big town and spent the night with whores, or they may have stayed the night with an old friend who gave them the best he could, or they may have taken refuge in a Franciscan monastery where they were badly lodged and badly fed all for the love of God. They may have been welcomed into the house of a great man where they lacked everything that was necessary to them and were surrounded by everything that was superfluous, or the next morning they may have left a large inn where they paid dearly for a bad supper served on silver platters and a bad night spent in beds with damask curtains and damp creased sheets, or they may have received hospitality from some village priest on a meagre stipend who ran round his parishioners’ poultry yards requisitioning the wherewithal to make an omelette and a chicken fricassee, or they may have got drunk on excellent wine, eaten far too much and got the appropriate bout of indigestion in a rich Benedictine abbey. Although all of these might appear equally feasible to you, Jacques was not of this opinion. The only possibility was the one that was written up above. What is, however, true, is that when they had started out from whatever location you would have them start out from they had gone no further than twenty paces when the master said to Jacques, after, of course, having first, as was his habit, taken his pinch of snuff: ‘Well then, Jacques, the story of your loves?’ Instead of replying Jacques cried out: ‘The devil with the story of my loves!"

"Moi, je ressemblais, au milieu de ces gens-là, à un patient qui a entendu sa sentence. Je disais au chevalier : « Chevalier, allons-nous-en, puisque ces messieurs ne peuvent rien… » Et le chevalier me tirant à l’écart : « Tu n’y penses pas, c’est la veille de sa fête. Je l’ai prévenue, je t’en avertis ; et elle s’attend à une galanterie de ta part. Tu la connais : ce n’est pas qu’elle soit intéressée ; mais elle est comme les autres, qui n’aiment pas à être trompées dans leur attente. Elle s’en sera déjà vantée à son père, à sa mère, à ses tantes, à ses amies ; et, après cela, n’avoir rien à leur montrer cela est mortifiant… » Et puis le voilà revenu à Merval, et le pressant plus vivement encore. Merval, après s’être bien fait tirailler, dit : « J’ai la plus sotte âme du monde ; je ne saurais voir les gens en peine. Je rêve ; et il me vient une idée.","Me, I looked like, among these people, like a patient who has heard his sentence. I said to the knight: ""Knight, let's go, since these gentlemen can't do anything..."" And the knight pulling me aside: ""Don't you think about it, it's the day before his birthday. I warned her, I warn you; and she expects gallantry from you. You know her: it's not that she's interested; but she is like the others, who do not like to be deceived in their expectation. She will have already boasted about it to her father, her mother, her aunts, her friends; and, after that, having nothing to show them is mortifying…” And then he returned to Merval, urging him even more strongly. Merval, after being tugged at, said, “I have the dumbest soul in the world; I cannot see people in pain. I dream ; and an idea occurs to me.","As I stood there in their midst, I felt like a sick man on whom a death sentence has just been pronounced.

It's her birthday tomorrow. I warn you, I've set it all up and she's expecting you to come up with a suitable offering. You know how she is. It's not that she's self-interested, but she's like all other women—they don't like having their hopes dashed. She may already have boasted about it to her father, mother, aunts, and girlfriends and then, when it turns out she's got nothing to show them, she'll be mortified.' And so he turned back to Merval and pressed him even harder. After allowing himself to be plagued for some time, Merval said: 'I've got the softest heart in all the world. I hate to see people in difficulty. I'm thinking... I've got an idea.'","And I, standing in the midst of these people, resembled a patient who has heard his death sentence.

I have warned her, I tell you, and she is expecting a gallant gesture on your part. You know her. It is not that she is self-interested, but she is like all the others and does not like to be betrayed in her expectations. She may already have boasted to her father, her mother, her aunts, to her friends, and, after all that, to have nothing to show them, that is mortifying…’ And then he went back to Merval and pressed him even harder.

I've not missed mass once these last two weeks. Ah, Marquise! Such a face! She is so beautiful!",I have to see her again and it must be through you. All my agents are in the field. The only thing the two women do is to go from their house to the church and from the church to their house. I have intercepted them on foot at least ten times and they have not even noticed me. I have waited at their door without success. At first their snubs made me debauched as a monk and then as devout as an angel. I haven’t missed Mass for a fortnight. Ah! My friend! What a face!

"Le marquis venait donc tous les jours causer avec Mme de La Pommeraye, qui achevait de l’irriter, de l’endurcir et de le perdre par les discours les plus artificieux. Il s’informait de la patrie, de la naissance, de l’éducation, de la fortune et du désastre de ces femmes ; il y revenait sans cesse, et ne se croyait jamais assez instruit et touché. La marquise lui faisait remarquer le progrès de ses sentiments, et lui en familiarisait le terme, sous prétexte de lui en inspirer de l’effroi. « Marquis, lui disait-elle, prenez-y garde, cela vous mènera loin ; il pourrait arriver un jour que mon amitié, dont vous faites un étrange abus, ne m’excusât ni à mes yeux ni aux vôtres. Ce n’est pas que tous les jours on ne fasse de plus grandes folies. Marquis, je crains fort que vous n’obteniez cette fille qu’à des conditions qui, jusqu’à présent, n’ont pas été de votre goût. »","The Marquis therefore came every day to talk with Madame de La Pommeraye, who ended up irritating him, hardening him, and ruining him by the most artful speeches. He inquired about the country, the birth, the education, the fortune and the disaster of these women; he came back to it constantly, and never thought himself sufficiently instructed and touched. The marquise pointed out to him the progress of his feelings, and familiarized him with their term, under the pretext of inspiring him with dread. 'Marquis,' she would say to him, 'take care, it will take you far; it might happen one day that my friendship, of which you make a strange abuse, would excuse me neither in my eyes nor in yours. It is not that every day we do not commit greater follies. Marquis, I'm afraid you're only getting this girl on terms that so far haven't been to your liking. »","So the Marquis came each day and talked to Madame de La Pommeraye who, with artful words, stoked him to fever pitch, strengthened his resolve, and completed his downfall. He instituted enquiries and learned of the origins, family, fortune, and ruin of both mother and daughter. He returned to the subject again and again and did not believe he was as fully informed and certainly not as moved by their fate as he might be. The Marquise helped make him aware of the progress of his own feelings and painted alluring pictures of how it all might end by issuing seemingly friendly warnings ostensibly intended to frighten him off. 'Marquis,' she would say, 'tread very carefully. A day might come when my friendship, on which you trespass so outrageously, will no longer be sufficient to justify my actions either in my eyes or yours. Of course, there are men who commit worse follies every day. But, Marquis, I fear that you will not get the girl except on conditions which, until now, have not been to your liking.'","And so every day the Marquis would come and speak to Mme de La Pommeraye, who with her artful speeches succeeded in driving him to a peak of irritation, resolution and perdition. He found out about the birthplace, the education, the fortune and the misfortune of these two women. He came back to this all the time and never thought himself well enough informed or touched enough by the story. The Marquise pointed out how his feelings were becoming deeper and stronger and under the pretext of frightening him gradually got him used to considering what would be the final outcome of this process. ‘Marquis,’ she said to him, ‘take great care for yourself. This passion will take you to great lengths. There may well come a day when my friendship which you now abuse so strangely, will not excuse me in your eyes, or in those of others. It is not as though even greater follies are not a daily occurrence. Marquis, I have grave suspicions that you will only obtain this girl on conditions which up to now have not been to your liking.’"

"L’après-dînée, le soleil s’éclaircit. Quelques voyageurs assurèrent que le ruisseau était guéable. Jacques descendit ; son maître paya l’hôtesse très largement. Voilà à la porte de l’auberge un assez grand nombre de passagers que le mauvais temps y avait retenus, se préparant à continuer leur route ; parmi ces passagers, Jacques et son maître, l’homme au mariage saugrenu et son compagnon. Les piétons ont pris leurs bâtons et leurs bissacs ; d’autres s’arrangent dans leurs fourgons ou leurs voitures ; les cavaliers sont sur leurs chevaux, et boivent le vin de l’étrier. L’hôtesse affable tient une bouteille à la main, présente des verres, et les remplit, sans oublier le sien ; on lui dit des choses obligeantes ; elle y répond avec politesse et gaieté. On pique des deux, on se salue et l’on s’éloigne.","In the afternoon, the sun brightened. Some travelers assured that the stream was fordable. Jacques got out; his master paid the hostess very generously. There are at the door of the inn a large number of passengers whom the bad weather had detained there, preparing to continue their journey; among these passengers, Jacques and his master, the man with the absurd marriage and his companion. The pedestrians have taken up their sticks and wallets; others arrange themselves in their vans or their cars; the riders are on their horses, and drink wine from the stirrup. The affable hostess holds a bottle in her hand, offers glasses, and fills them, not forgetting her own; they say obliging things to him; she responds with politeness and gaiety. We shove, we greet each other and we walk away.","In the afternoon the sun came out. Several travellers reported that the little river was fordable. Jacques went downstairs. His Master paid their landlady very handsomely. At the door of the inn was gathered a sizeable knot of travellers who had been detained by the bad weather and were now preparing to continue their several journeys. Among these travellers are Jacques and his Master, and the man who had got married in peculiar circumstances and his companion. The foot-travellers take their sticks and shoulder their packs. Others settle themselves into covered carts or carriages. The riders are mounted and taking a stirrup cup for the road. The landlady, ever hospitable, holds a bottle, hands out glasses and fills them, not forgetting one for herself. She is thanked most graciously and she replies with courteous good cheer. Then they spur their mounts, say their goodbyes, and they're off.","After lunch the sun came out. A few travellers assured them that the stream could now be crossed. Jacques went downstairs. His master paid their hostess very generously. At the door of the inn quite a large number of travellers who had been held back by the bad weather were getting ready to continue on their way. Among these travellers were Jacques and his master, the man who had made the ridiculous marriage and his friend. Those travellers who were on foot had taken their sticks and their bundles, others had got into their wagons or coaches and those with horses were mounted up drinking stirrup cups. Their gracious hostess had a bottle in one hand and was giving out glasses and filling them, not forgetting her own. They all made obliging remarks to her which she replied to with politeness and gaiety. Then they spurred their horses, waved goodbye and went off into the distance."
"« Descendez, maroufle ! obéissez-moi. »","“Come down, scumbag! obey me. »","'Shift your bones, you insolent dog! Do what I tell you!'","His master shook him hard and said: ‘Go down, you scoundrel, obey me.’"
"Tout cela est fort beau, ajoutez-vous ; mais les amours de Jacques ? – Les amours de Jacques, il y a que Jacques qui les sache ; et le voilà tourmenté d’un mal de gorge qui réduit son maître à sa montre et à sa tabatière ; indigence qui l’afflige autant que vous : Qu’allons-nous donc devenir ? – Ma foi, je n’en sais rien. Ce serait bien ici le cas d’interroger la dive Bacbuc ou la gourde sacrée ; mais son culte tombe, ses temples sont déserts. Ainsi qu’à la naissance de notre divin Sauveur, les oracles du paganisme cessèrent ; à la mort de Gallet, les oracles de Bacbuc furent muets ; aussi plus de grands poèmes, plus de ces morceaux une éloquence sublime ; plus de ces productions marquées au coin de l’ivresse et du génie ; tout est raisonné, compassé, académique et plat. Ô dive Bacbuc ! ô gourde sacrée ! ô divinité de Jacques ! Revenez au milieu de nous !… Il me prend envie, lecteur, de vous entretenir de la naissance de la dive Bacbuc, des prodiges qui l’accompagnèrent et qui la suivirent, des merveilles de son règne et des désastres de sa retraite ; et si le mal de gorge de notre ami Jacques dure, et que son maître s’opiniâtre à garder le silence, il faudra bien que vous vous contentiez de cet épisode, que je tâcherai de pousser jusqu’à ce que Jacques guérisse et reprenne l’histoire de ses amours…","All this is very fine, you add; but the loves of Jacques? – The loves of Jacques, only Jacques knows about them; and there he is tormented by a sore throat which reduces his master to his watch and his snuffbox; indigence which afflicts him as much as you: What are we going to become? - Well, I don't know. This would be the case here to question the dive Bacbuc or the sacred gourd; but its worship falls, its temples are deserted. As at the birth of our divine Saviour, the oracles of paganism ceased; at the death of Gallet, the oracles of Bacbuc were dumb; also no more great poems, no more of these pieces a sublime eloquence; no more of these productions marked at the corner of intoxication and genius; everything is reasoned, formal, academic and flat. O dive Bacbuc! O sacred gourd! O divinity of Jacques! Come back among us!... It takes me, reader, to speak to you of the birth of the divine Bacbuc, of the prodigies which accompanied her and which followed her, of the marvels of her reign and the disasters of her retirement; and if our friend Jacques' sore throat lasts, and his master stubbornly keeps silent, you will have to content yourself with this episode, which I will try to push until Jacques recovers and resumes the story of his love...","That's all very well, you add, but what about Jacques's love-life? Only Jacques knows the tale of his love-life, and he's come down with a sore throat which has left his Master with only his watch and snuffbox, a privation which he finds no less distressing than you do. So where does that leave us, then? To be frank, I haven't a clue. This might be a good moment to consult sacred Bacbuc or the holy gourd, but the faith is declining and its temples are deserted. Just as the oracles of the pagans ceased when our divine Saviour was born, so the oracles of Bacbuc fell silent when Gallet died. * Which means no more great poems, no more outpourings of sublime eloquence, no more masterpieces stamped by the intoxication of genius: everything has become reasoned, encompassed, academic, and very, very flat. O holy Bacbuc! O sacred gourd! O Divinity worshipped by Jacques! Return to our midst! Reader, the urge has come upon me to tell you of the birth of the divine Bacbuc, of the prodigies which attended it and proceeded from it, of the miracles of her reign and the disasters which followed her retirement. And if the sore throat which has struck Jacques lasts and his Master stubbornly persists in not speaking, then you'll just have to make do with my account of it. I shall endeavour to spin it out until Jacques is fully recovered and can resume the story of his loves.","– That’s all very nice, you are saying, but what about Jacques’ loves? Jacques’ loves? Only Jacques knows about those, and there he is tormented by a sore throat which has reduced his master to his watch and his snuff-box – a privation which distresses him as much as you. – What is to become of us? My God, how should I know? This would now be an opportune moment to consult the divine Bacbuc or the sacred gourd, but her cult has declined, her temples are deserted. In the same way as the pagan oracles ended on the birth of our Saviour, so did the oracles of Bacbuc become silent on the death of Gallet. And so that was the end of those great poems, no more of those sublimely eloquent pieces, no more of those works stamped with the seal of drunkenness and genius. Everything is reasoned, measured, academic and flat. Oh divine Bacbuc! Oh sacred gourd! Oh divinity of Jacques! Come back amongst us… There comes upon me, Reader, the need to talk to you about the birth of the divine Bacbuc, of the prodigies which accompanied her and followed her, of the marvels of her reign and the disasters of her retreat from society. And if our friend Jacques’ sore throat continues and if his master stubbornly persists in silence you will have to make do with this story, which I will try and drag out until Jacques recovers and continues the story of his loves."
"– Je ne pense plus à ces vanités ; je lis l’Écriture, je médite les Pères.","“I no longer think of these vanities; I read Scripture, I meditate on the Fathers.",'I have ceased to think of the vanities.

"Alors la marquise de La Pommeraye se couvrit les yeux de ses mains, pencha la tête et se tut un moment après lequel elle ajouta : « Marquis, je me suis attendue à tout votre étonnement, à toutes les choses amères que vous m’allez dire. Marquis ! épargnez-moi… Non, ne m’épargnez pas, dites-les-moi ; je les écouterai avec résignation, parce que je les mérite. Oui, mon cher marquis, il est vrai… Oui, je suis… Mais, n’est pas un assez grand malheur que la chose soit arrivée, sans y ajouter encore la honte, le mépris d’être fausse, en vous le dissimulant ? Vous êtes le même, mais votre amie est changée ; votre amie vous révère, vous estime autant et plus que jamais ; mais… mais une femme accoutumée comme elle à examiner de près ce qui se passe dans les replis les plus secrets de son âme et à ne s’en imposer sur rien, ne peut se cacher que l’amour en est sorti. La découverte est affreuse mais elle n’en est pas moins réelle. La marquise de La Pommeraye, moi, moi, inconstante ! légère !… Marquis, entrez en fureur, cherchez les noms les plus odieux, je me les suis donnés d’avance : donnez-les-moi, je suis prête à les accepter tous…, tous, excepté celui de femme fausse, que vous m’épargnerez, je l’espère, car en vérité je ne le suis pas… » (Ma femme ? – Qu’est-ce ? – Rien. – On n’a pas un moment de repos dans cette maison, même les jours qu’on n’a presque point de monde et que l’on croit n’avoir rien à faire. Qu’une femme de mon état est à plaindre, surtout avec une bête de mari.) Cela dit, Mme de La Pommeraye se renversa sur son fauteuil et se mit à pleurer. Le marquis se précipita à ses genoux, et lui dit : « Vous êtes une femme charmante, une femme adorable, une femme comme il n’y en a point. Votre franchise, votre honnêteté me confond et devrait me faire mourir de honte. Ah ! quelle supériorité ce moment vous donne sur moi ! Que je vous vois grande et que je me trouve petit ! C’est vous qui avez parlé la première, et c’est moi qui fus coupable le premier. Mon amie, votre sincérité m’entraîne ; je serais un monstre si elle ne m’entraînait pas, et je vous avouerai que l’histoire de votre cœur est mot à mot l’histoire du mien. Tout ce que vous vous êtes dit, je me le suis dit ; mais je me taisais, je souffrais, et je ne sais quand j’aurais eu le courage de parler.","Then the Marquise de La Pommeraye covered her eyes with her hands, bent her head and was silent for a moment after which she added: ""Marquis, I expected all your astonishment, all the bitter things you are going to say to me. . Marquis! spare me... No, don't spare me, tell me; I will listen to them with resignation, because I deserve them. Yes, my dear marquis, it's true... Yes, I am... But isn't it a bad enough thing that the thing happened, without adding to it the shame, the contempt of being false, by concealing it from you? You are the same, but your friend is changed; your friend reveres you, esteems you as much and more than ever; but... but a woman accustomed like her to closely examining what goes on in the most secret recesses of her soul and not imposing herself on anything, cannot hide from herself that love has come out of it. The discovery is dreadful but it is no less real. The Marquise de La Pommeraye, me, me, inconstant! light!... Marquis, get into a rage, look for the most odious names, I have given them to myself in advance: give them to me, I am ready to accept them all..., all, except that of false woman, which you spare me, I hope, for in truth I am not…” (My wife? – What is it? – Nothing. – There is not a moment of rest in this house, even on days that we have hardly any people and that we believe we have nothing to do. fell back in his chair and began to cry. The marquis threw himself on his knees and said to him: ""You are a charming woman, an adorable woman, a woman like no other."" Your frankness, your honesty confuses me and should make me die of shame. Ah! what a superiority this moment gives you over me! How tall I see you and how small I feel! You were the first to speak, and I was the first to blame. My friend, your sincerity carries me away; I would be a monster if she did not drag me away, and I will confess to you that the story of your heart is, word for word, the story of mine. Everything you said to yourself, I said to myself; but I was silent, I suffered, and I don't know when I should have had the courage to speak.","Madame de La Pommeraye covered her eyes with her hands, bowed her head, and paused for a moment. Then she resumed: 'Marquis, I knew that you would be very shocked and know all the bitter things you will now say to me. Spare me this, Marquis... or rather do not spare me. Speak your words of reproach and I shall be an acquiescent listener, for I deserve every one of them. Yes, dear Marquis, it is true... Yes, I am... Yet is it not bad enough that it has happened, without my further adding to it the shame and contumely of deceit by pretending that things are other than what they seem? You are the same, but the woman who loves you has changed. She adores you and respects you as much, nay more, than ever. But... but a woman as accustomed as I am to ponder the secret motions of my innermost feelings, and am never anything but honest with myself, cannot fail to acknowledge that the love I felt has fled. It is the most dreadful discovery to make, but it is no less real for that. I, Marquise de La Pommeraye, fickle? inconstant?... Marquis, do not stay your anger, think of the most odious names —I have already applied them to my case—and call me by them, for I am ready to accept them all... all of them, I say, but do not call me unfaithful in my affections. This you will, I hope, spare me , for in truth I am not such a woman.' 'Wife?' 'What is it?' 'Nothing.' 'There's never a minute's peace in this place, even on days when we've hardly any customers and you'd think there was nothing to do. A woman in my position doesn't have it easy, especially with a husband as stupid as mine.' Landlady. So saying, Madame de La Pommeraye sinks back into her armchair and begins to weep. At once, the Marquis falls to his knees before her and says: 'You are a wonderful, an adorable woman, and I know no other to compare with you. I am confounded by your candour and honesty which fill me with shame. Ah! how infinitely superior you are to me at this moment! How tall you stand in my eyes and how small I feel! You were the first to speak and yet it was I who was guilty first. My dear, your sincerity is contagious. I would be a monster if it were not, and I will confess that the history of your heart is also the history of mine, to the letter. Everything you have ruminated upon I have ruminated upon myself, but I said nothing, suffered in silence, and cannot say when I would have found the courage to speak...'","Then the Marquise de La Pommeraye covered her eyes, lowered her head and was quiet for a moment, after which she added: ‘Marquis, I expected the full scale of your astonishment and the bitter words that you are going to say to me. Marquis! Spare me… No, do not spare me. Say them to me. I will resign myself to listening because I deserve them. Yes, my dear Marquis, it is true… yes, I am… But is it not bad enough that the thing should have happened at all without my adding to it the shame and the scorn of being false and hiding it from you? You are the same but your friend has changed. She reveres you and respects you as much as and more than ever but… but a woman as accustomed as she is to examine carefully everything that happens even in the most secret parts of her heart, and to avoid all self-deception, such a woman cannot hide the fact that there is no love in her heart. The discovery is horrifying but is not any the less real. Me, the Marquise de La Pommeraye, inconstant, fickle… Marquis, fly into a rage, look for the most odious of names. I’ve called myself them all already. Call me them. I will accept them, all of them, except that of false woman, which you will spare me, I hope, because, in all truth, I am not that.’ ‘Wife?’ ‘What is it?’ ‘Nothing.’ ‘There’s never a moment’s rest in this house… even on days when there’s hardly anyone here and you would think there was nothing to do. Oh, a woman in my position is not to be envied, especially with a fool of a husband like that…’ When she had finished Mme de La Pommeraye threw herself into her armchair and started crying. The Marquis rushed to her knees. ‘You are a charming woman, an adorable woman, a woman unlike any other. Your candour and your honesty confound me and ought to make me die of shame. Ah, how vastly superior you are to me at this moment. How noble I find you and how mean I perceive myself. You have spoken first and yet it is I who was guilty first. My friend, your sincerity inspires me, and I would be a monster if it did not, and I admit that what you have said of your feelings applies word for word to mine. Everything that you have said to yourself I have said to myself, but I have kept quiet and suffered in silence. I don’t know when I would have had the courage to speak.’"

"Lecteur, il me vient un scrupule, c’est d’avoir fait honneur à Jacques ou à son maître de quelques réflexions qui vous appartiennent de droit ; si cela est, vous pouvez les reprendre sans qu’ils s’en formalisent. J’ai cru m’apercevoir que le mot Bigre vous déplaisait. Je voudrais bien savoir pourquoi. C’est le vrai nom de famille de mon charron ; les extraits baptistaires, extraits mortuaires, contrats de mariage en sont signés Bigre. Les descendants de Bigre, qui occupent aujourd’hui la boutique, s’appellent Bigre. Quand leurs enfants, qui sont jolis, passent dans la rue, on dit : « Voilà les petits Bigres. » Quand vous prononcez le nom de Boule, vous vous rappelez le plus grand ébéniste que vous ayez eu. On ne prononce point encore dans la contrée de Bigre le nom de Bigre sans se rappeler le plus grand charron dont on ait mémoire. Le Bigre, dont on lit le nom à la fin de tous les livres d’offices pieux du commencement de ce siècle, fut un de ses parents. Si jamais un arrière-neveu de Bigre se signale par quelque grande action, le nom personnel de Bigre ne sera pas moins imposant pour vous que celui de César ou de Condé. C’est qu’il y a Bigre et Bigre, comme Guillaume et Guillaume. Si je dis Guillaume tout court, ce ne sera ni le conquérant de la Grande Bretagne, ni le marchand de drap de l’Avocat Patelin ; le nom de Guillaume tout court ne sera ni héroïque ni bourgeois : ainsi de Bigre. Bigre tout court n’est ni le fameux charron ni quelqu’un de ses plats ancêtres ou de ses plats descendants. En bonne foi, un nom personnel peut-il être de bon ou de mauvais goût ? Les rues sont pleines de mâtins qui s’appellent Pompée. Défaites-vous donc de votre fausse délicatesse, ou j’en userai avec vous comme milord Chatham avec les membres du parlement ; il leur dit : « Sucre, Sucre, Sucre ; qu’est ce qu’il y a de ridicule là-dedans ?… » Et moi, je vous dirai : « Bigre Bigre, Bigre ; pourquoi ne s’appellerait-on pas Bigre ? » C’est, comme le disait un officier à son général le grand Condé, qu’il y a un fier Bigre comme Bigre le charron ; un bon Bigre, comme vous et moi ; de plats Bigres, comme une infinité d’autres.","Reader, I have a scruple, it is to have done honor to Jacques or to his master with some reflections which belong to you by right; if so, you can take them back without them being offended. I thought I noticed that the word Bigre displeased you. I would like to know why. This is my wheelwright's real family name; the baptismal extracts, mortuary extracts, marriage contracts are signed Bigre. The descendants of Bigre, who occupy the shop today, are called Bigre. When their children, who are pretty, pass in the street, we say: ""Here are the little Bigres."" When you say Boule's name, you remember the greatest cabinetmaker you ever had. One does not yet pronounce in the region of Bigre the name of Bigre without remembering the greatest wheelwright of which one has memory. Le Bigre, whose name we read at the end of all the pious office books of the beginning of this century, was one of his relatives. If ever a great-nephew of Bigre distinguishes himself by some great deed, the personal name of Bigre will be no less imposing for you than that of Caesar or Condé. There is Bigre and Bigre, like Guillaume and Guillaume. If I say Guillaume very short, it will be neither the conqueror of Great Britain, nor the cloth merchant of the Patelin Lawyer; the name of Guillaume tout court will be neither heroic nor bourgeois: like Bigre. Bigre tout court is neither the famous wheelwright nor one of his ancestor dishes or his descendant dishes. In good faith, can a personal name be in good or bad taste? The streets are full of mastiffs called Pompey. Get rid of your false delicacy, or I will use it with you as Lord Chatham does with the members of parliament; he said to them: “Sugar, Sugar, Sugar; what is ridiculous in that?…” And I will say to you: “Bigre Bigre, Bigre; why wouldn't we be called Bigre? It is, as an officer said to his general, the great Condé, that there is a proud Bigre like Bigre the wheelwright; a good Bigre, like you and me; Bigres dishes, like an infinity of others.","Reader, a sudden unease tugs at my conscience. The fact is I have given Jacques and his Master the honour of making a series of observations which, properly speaking, should be your province. If that is indeed the case, then feel free to say your piece now. Jacques and his Master won't raise any objections. I also think I sense that you're not too happy with this name, Buger. I can't think why. It was the real name of my wheelwright's family. Their records of baptism, death certificates, and marriage lines are all made out in the name of Buger. Buger's descendants, who still occupy his premises today, are called Buger. When their children, who are pretty little things, walk down the street, people say: 'There go the little Bugers.' When you say the name Boulle,* you commemorate the greatest cabinetmaker who ever lived. Even today, where the Bugers come from, no one mentions the name Buger without recalling the greatest wheelwright in living memory. The man whose name figures at the end of all the devotional prayer-books published around the start of the century was a relative of his. If ever some grand-nephew of Buger were to distinguish himself by some great action, the name Buger will impress you just as much as 'Caesar' or 'Conde'. * For there's Buger and Buger just as there's William and William. If I just say William, I don't mean the Conqueror of England nor the draper in the play of Maitre-Pathelin. * By itself, the name William is neither heroic nor common. It's exactly the same with Buger. By itself, Buger is neither the famous wheelwright nor any one of his dull ancestors or his boring descendants. In all conscience, can a person's name be tasteful or tasteless? The streets are full of dogs called Pompey. So put away your false prudery, or I shall say to you what Lord Chatham said to members of Parliament: ' Sh... ugar, sugar, sugar: what do you find so funny about that?' * And I in turn ask you: 'Buger, Buger, Buger: why shouldn't people be called Buger?' The fact of the matter is that, as one of the Great Conde's officers once remarked to him, there are proud Bugers, like Buger the wheelwright, decent Bugers, like you and me, and Bugers who are just as dull as any number of other people.","Reader, there is something that is worrying me, and that is that I have honoured Jacques or his master with making reflections which belong to you by right. If that is the case you can take them back without Jacques and his master taking offence. I believe that I have also noticed that the word ‘Bugger’ displeases you. I would like to know why. It is the real name of my cartwright’s family. Their birth certificates, death certificates and marriage certificates are all signed ‘Bugger’. The descendants of Bugger occupy the same workshop today and they are all called Bugger. When their children, who are all pretty, pass by in the street, people cry out: ‘Look at the little Buggers!’ When you pronounce the word Boulle you remember one of the greatest cabinet-makers that ever lived. In Bugger’s country no one pronounces the name Bugger without remembering the greatest cartwright in living memory. The Bugger whose name is on all the pious religious publications of the beginning of this century was related to him. If ever the great-grand-nephew of Bugger distinguishes himself the name will be no less imposing to you than that of Caesar or Condé.57 You see there’s Bugger and Bugger like there’s William and William. If I say simply William, that is neither William the Conqueror nor William the draper in the farce of Maître Pathelin.58 The name William is neither heroic nor common. And it’s the same with Bugger. Bugger without qualification is neither the famous cartwright nor one of his boring ancestors nor one of his boring descendants. In all honesty, how can a person’s name be in good or bad taste? The streets are full of hounds called Pompey. So cast off your irrational false sense of propriety or I shall have to deal with you like Lord Chatham dealt with Parliament: ‘Shh… ugar, Sugar, Sugar,’ he said to them. ‘What do you find so funny about that?’59 And as for me I say unto you: Bugger, Bugger, Bugger. Why shouldn’t someone be called Bugger? As one of his officers told General Condé, the thing is there’s proud Buggers like Bugger the cartwright, good Buggers like you and me, and plain Buggers like a hell of a lot of others."

"Ici, Jacques fit halte à son récit, et donna une nouvelle atteinte à sa gourde. Les atteintes étaient d’autant plus fréquentes que les distances étaient courtes, ou comme disent les géomètres, en raison inverse des distances. Il était si précis dans ses mesures ; que, pleine en partant, elle était toujours exactement vide en arrivant. Messieurs des ponts et chaussées en auraient fait un excellent odomètre, et chaque atteinte avait communément sa raison suffisante. Celle-ci était pour faire revenir Denise de son évanouissement, et se remettre de la douleur de l’incision que le chirurgien lui avait faite au genou. Denise revenue, et lui réconforté, il continua.","Here Jacques halted in his story, and gave a new blow to his gourd. Attacks were all the more frequent when the distances were short, or as the surveyors say, in inverse proportion to the distances. He was so precise in his measurements; that, full when leaving, it was always exactly empty when arriving. Gentlemen of the Roads and Bridges would have made an excellent odometer out of it, and each violation had its sufficient reason. This was to bring Denise back from her fainting spell, and recover from the pain of the incision the surgeon had made in her knee. Denise returned, and comforted him, he continued.","At this point, Jacques paused in his narration and took another swig from his gourd. These pauses were more frequent as the distances grew shorter, or, as geometers says, they were in inverse proportion to the said distances. He judged the quantities so exactly that, while the gourd was full when he set out, it was empty to the last drop when he arrived. The men who run the roads could have used him as a first-rate odometer,* and generally speaking each pause had its sufficient reason. * On this occasion, the reason was to allow Denise to recover from her swoon and himself to get over the pain caused by the incision the surgeon had made in his knee. When Denise had recovered and he felt comforted, he continued:","At this point Jacques stopped his story and took another pull at his gourd. His halts became more frequent as the distances became shorter, or, as the geometricians say, they were in inverse proportion to the distances. He was so precise in his measurements that although the gourd was full on leaving it was always exactly empty on arrival.

This time it was to bring Denise back from her faint and to recover from the pain of the incision the surgeon had made in his knee. When Denise had recovered and he was comforted he continued."

"La passion de l’hôtesse pour les bêtes n’était pourtant pas sa passion dominante, comme on pourrait l’imaginer ; c’était celle de parler. Plus on avait de plaisir et de patience à l’écouter, plus on avait de mérite ; aussi ne se fit-elle pas prier pour reprendre l’histoire interrompue du mariage singulier ; elle y mit seulement pour condition que Jacques se tairait. Le maître promit du silence pour Jacques. Jacques s’étala nonchalamment dans un coin, les yeux fermés, son bonnet renfoncé sur ses oreilles et le dos à demi tourné à l’hôtesse. Le maître toussa, cracha, se moucha, tira sa montre, vit l’heure qu’il était, tira sa tabatière, frappa sur le couvercle, prit sa prise de tabac ; et l’hôtesse se mit en devoir de goûter le plaisir délicieux de pérorer.","The hostess' passion for animals was not, however, her dominant passion, as one might imagine; it was to speak. The more pleasure and patience one had in listening to it, the more merit one had; so she did not need to be asked to resume the interrupted story of the singular marriage; she only put it on condition that Jacques would be silent. The master promised silence for Jacques. Jacques sprawled nonchalantly into a corner, his eyes closed, his cap tucked over his ears and his back half turned to the hostess. The master coughed, spat, blew his nose, took out his watch, saw what time it was, took out his snuffbox, knocked on the lid, took his pinch of snuff; and the hostess began to taste the delicious pleasure of orating.","The landlady's fondness for dumb animals was not, however, her dominant passion, as you might think: it was talking. The more pleasure and patience you showed in listening to her, the better a person you were in her eyes. So she did not have to be asked twice to resume the interrupted story of the peculiar marriage, though she did lay down one condition: that Jacques would shut up. The Master promised that Jacques would hold his tongue. Jacques sprawled in a chair in one corner, eyes closed, with his cotton cap pulled well down over his ears and his back half-turned to the landlady. The Master coughed, spat, blew his nose, took out his watch, looked at the time, felt for his snuffbox, tapped the lid, and took a pinch. The landlady settled down to taste the delights of holding forth.","The innkeeper’s wife’s passion for animals was not, however, her dominant passion. As you might imagine, her dominant passion was talking. The more that people found pleasure and were patient in listening to her, the more worthy they were in her eyes. Consequently she didn’t have to be asked to carry on with the interrupted story of the strange marriage. The only condition she imposed was that Jacques shut up. His master promised silence on behalf of Jacques. Jacques stretched himself out nonchalantly in the corner, his eyes shut, hat pulled down over his ears and his back half-turned to their hostess. His master coughed, spat, blew his nose, took out his watch, looked at the time, took out his snuff-box, tapped its lid and took a pinch of snuff while their hostess prepared to indulge in the delicious pleasure of holding forth."

"Telle fut à la lettre la conversation du chirurgien, de l’hôte et de l’hôtesse : mais quelle autre couleur n’aurais-je pas été le maître de lui donner, en introduisant un scélérat parmi ces bonnes gens ? Jacques se serait vu, ou vous auriez vu Jacques au moment d’être arraché de son lit, jeté sur un grand chemin ou dans une fondrière. – Pourquoi pas tué ? – Tué, non. J’aurais bien su appeler quelqu’un à son secours ; ce quelqu’un-là aurait été un soldat de sa compagnie : mais cela aurait pué le Cleveland à infecter. La vérité, la vérité ! – La vérité, me direz-vous, est souvent froide, commune et plate ; par exemple, votre dernier récit du pansement de Jacques est vrai, mais qu’y a-t-il d’intéressant ? Rien. – D’accord. – S’il faut être vrai, c’est comme Molière, Regnard, Richardson, Sedaine ; la vérité a ses côtés piquants, qu’on saisit quand on a du génie. – Oui, quand on a du génie ; mais quand on en manque ? – Quand on en manque, il ne faut pas écrire. – Et si par malheur on ressemblait à un certain poète que j’envoyai à Pondichéry ? – Qu’est-ce que ce poète ? – Ce poète… Mais si vous m’interrompez, lecteur, et si je m’interromps moi-même à tout coup, que deviendront les amours de Jacques ? Croyez-moi, laissons là le poète… L’hôte et l’hôtesse s’éloignèrent… – Non, non, l’histoire du poète de Pondichéry. – Le chirurgien s’approcha du lit de Jacques… – L’histoire du poète de Pondichéry, l’histoire du poète de Pondichéry. – Un jour, il me vint un jeune poète, comme il m’en vient tous les jours… Mais, lecteur, quel rapport cela a-t-il avec le voyage de Jacques le Fataliste et de son maître ?… – L’histoire du poète de Pondichéry. – Après les compliments ordinaires sur mon esprit, mon génie, mon goût, ma bienfaisance, et autres propos dont je ne crois pas un mot, bien qu’il y ait plus de vingt ans qu’on me les répète et peut-être de bonne foi, le jeune poète tire un papier de sa poche : ce sont des vers, me dit-il. – Des vers ! – Oui, monsieur, et sur lesquels j’espère que vous aurez la bonté de me dire votre avis. – Aimez-vous la vérité ? – Oui, monsieur ; et je vous la demande. – Vous allez la savoir. – Quoi ! vous êtes assez bête pour croire qu’un poète vient chercher la vérité chez vous ? – Oui. – Et pour la lui dire ? – Assurément ! – Sans ménagement ? – Sans doute : le ménagement le mieux apprêté ne serait qu’une offense grossière ; fidèlement interprété, il signifierait : vous êtes un mauvais poète ; et comme je ne vous crois pas assez robuste pour entendre la vérité, vous n’êtes encore qu’un plat homme. Et la franchise vous a toujours réussi ? – Presque toujours… Je lis les vers de mon jeune poète, et je lui dis : Non seulement vos vers sont mauvais, mais il m’est démontré que vous n’en ferez jamais de bons. – Il faudra donc que j’en fasse de mauvais ; car je ne saurais m’empêcher d’en faire. – Voilà une terrible malédiction ! Concevez-vous, monsieur, dans quel avilissement vous allez tomber ? Ni les dieux, ni les hommes, ni les colonnes, n’ont pardonné la médiocrité aux poètes : c’est Horace qui l’a dit. – Je le sais. – Êtes-vous riche ? – Non. – Êtes-vous pauvre ? – Très pauvre. – Et vous allez joindre à la pauvreté le ridicule de mauvais poète ; vous aurez perdu toute votre vie ; vous serez vieux. Vieux, pauvre et mauvais poète, ah ! monsieur, quel rôle ! – Je le conçois, mais je suis entraîné malgré moi… (Ici Jacques aurait dit : Mais cela est écrit là-haut.) – Avez-vous des parents ? – J’en ai. – Quel est leur état ? – Ils sont joailliers. – Feraient-ils quelque chose pour vous ? – Peut-être. – Eh bien ! voyez vos parents, proposez-leur de vous avancer une pacotille de bijoux. Embarquez-vous pour Pondichéry ; vous ferez de mauvais vers sur la route ; arrivé, vous ferez fortune. Votre fortune faite, vous reviendrez faire ici tant de mauvais vers qu’il vous plaira, pourvu que vous ne les fassiez pas imprimer, car il ne faut ruiner personne… Il y avait environ douze ans que j’avais donné ce conseil au jeune homme, lorsqu’il m’apparut ; je ne le reconnaissais pas. C’est moi, monsieur, me dit-il, que vous avez envoyé à Pondichéry. J’y ai été, j’ai amassé là une centaine de mille francs. Je suis revenu ; je me suis remis à faire des vers, et en voilà que je vous apporte… Ils sont toujours mauvais ? – Toujours ; mais votre sort est arrangé, et je consens que vous continuiez à faire de mauvais vers. – C’est bien mon projet… »","Such was literally the conversation of the surgeon, the host, and the hostess: but what other color could I not have given him, by introducing a scoundrel among these good people? Jacques would have seen himself, or you would have seen Jacques at the moment of being torn from his bed, thrown on a highway or in a bog. - Why not killed? – Killed, no. I should have known how to call someone to help him; that someone would have been a soldier of his company: but that would have stank of the Cleveland to infect. The truth, the truth! – The truth, you will tell me, is often cold, common and flat; for example, your last account of Jacques' bandage is true, but what is interesting? Nothing. - OK. – If it must be true, it is like Molière, Regnard, Richardson, Sedaine; the truth has its piquant sides, which one grasps when one has genius. – Yes, when one has genius; but when we lack? – When you don't have enough, you shouldn't write. ""And if by misfortune we resemble a certain poet whom I sent to Pondicherry?"" ""Who is this poet?"" – This poet… But if you interrupt me, reader, and if I interrupt myself all the time, what will become of Jacques’ loves? Believe me, let's leave the poet there... The host and the hostess walked away... - No, no, the story of the poet of Pondicherry. – The surgeon approached Jacques’ bed… – The story of the poet of Pondicherry, the story of the poet of Pondicherry. – One day, a young poet came to me, as it happens to me every day… But, reader, what does this have to do with the journey of Jacques le Fataliste and his master?… – The story of the poet from Pondicherry. – After the usual compliments on my wit, my genius, my taste, my benevolence, and other remarks of which I do not believe a word, although they have been repeated to me for more than twenty years and perhaps good faith, the young poet takes a piece of paper from his pocket: they are verses, he tells me. - Worms ! “Yes, sir, and on which I hope you will be good enough to tell me your opinion. – Do you like the truth? - Yes sir ; and I ask you. - You will find out. - What ! you are stupid enough to believe that a poet comes to seek the truth at home? - Yes. ""And to tell him?"" - Certainly ! - Unceremoniously ? – Doubtless: the best prepared consideration would only be a gross offence; faithfully interpreted, it would mean: you are a bad poet; and as I don't believe you are strong enough to hear the truth, you are still only a flat man. And the franchise has always been successful for you? – Almost always… I read the verses of my young poet, and I say to him: Not only are your verses bad, but it has been shown to me that you will never write good ones. “So I will have to make bad ones; because I can't stop myself from doing it. “Here is a terrible curse! Do you conceive, sir, into what degradation you are going to fall? Neither the gods, nor men, nor columns have forgiven poets mediocrity: it was Horace who said so. - I know it. – Are you rich? - Nope. – Are you poor? - Very poor. – And you will add to poverty the ridiculousness of a bad poet; you will have lost your whole life; you will be old. Old, poor and bad poet, ah! sir, what a role! – I understand it, but I am dragged in spite of myself… (Here Jacques would have said: But that is written up there.) – Do you have parents? - I do not have. – What is their condition? – They are jewelers. ""Would they do something for you?"" - Perhaps. - Well ! see your parents, offer them a piece of jewelry. Embark for Pondicherry; you will make bad verses on the road; arrived, you will make a fortune. Your fortune made, you will come back here to write as many bad verses as you please, provided you do not have them printed, for you must not ruin anyone… It was about twelve years since I had given this advice to the young man , when he appeared to me; I didn't recognize him. It was I, sir, he said, you sent to Pondicherry. I was there, I amassed there a hundred thousand francs. I returned ; I went back to writing verses, and here I am bringing you some… Are they still bad? - Still ; but your fate is arranged, and I consent to your continuing to write bad verses. ""It's my project...""","Such, verbatim, was the conversation that took place between the surgeon, the husband, and the wife. But since I'm in total charge here, just think how different the mood would have been if I'd substituted a nasty character for one of these good people. If I'd done that, Jacques would have seen himself (or been seen by you) on the point of being manhandled out of bed, dumped on a road, or left in a ditch. Why not killed? No, not killed, I'd have sent for somebody to come to the rescue. That somebody would have been a soldier from his company— but that would have reeked with the stench of Cleveland. * Truth! truth! But truth, you'll say, is usually cold, ordinary, and flat. For example, the account you've just given of the way Jacques's knee was bandaged may be true but is it interesting? It's not. Agreed. If a writer is to be true, then he's got to be cast in the mould of Moliere, Regnard, Richardson, or Sedaine*—truth has its interesting side, which a writer will latch on to if he has genius. If he has genius, I grant you. But what if he doesn't? If a man doesn't have genius, then he shouldn't try to write. But what if a man is unfortunate enough to be like a certain poet I once packed off to Pondicherry? * What poet's that? This poet... but look here, Reader, if you keep on interrupting me and I interrupt myself like this, what will become of the story of Jacques's loves? Take my advice and let's drop the poet. So, the husband and his wife stepped to one side... No, no. Let's have the story of the poet from Pondicherry. The surgeon crossed over to Jacques's bed... Tell us the story of the poet from Pondicherry! Let's have the story of the poet from Pondicherry! One day, a young man came to see me. Young men come to see me every day of the week... Look, Reader, what's he got to do with the travels of the fatalist Jacques and his Master? Give us the story of the poet from Pondicherry! After the usual polite, courteous comments about my intelligence, my genius, my taste, my benevolence, and other remarks which I never believe a word of, although people have been making them to me for twenty years, and quite sincerely for all I know, the young poet produces a sheet of paper from his pocket. 'These are some of my poems,' said he. 'Poems?' 'Yes, sir, and I was hoping you might be good enough to give me your opinion of them.' 'Do you like the truth?' 'Yes, sir, it's what I ask of you.' 'You shall have it.' Just hold it there. You're not stupid enough to believe that a poet will come to you expecting the truth? Yes. And you'd give it him? Certainly. Straight from the shoulder? Oh, yes. However kind your motives, dressing the truth up is always the crudest form of insult. When you think it through, it means: 'you are a rotten poet and, since I clearly don't believe you're man enough to stand the truth, you're also a pretty feeble specimen.' And being frank has always worked? Almost invariably. .. So I read the young man's poems right through. Then I said: 'Not only are these poems bad, they make it obvious to me that you'll never ever write any good ones.' 'Then I shall have to write bad ones, because I can't stop writing poems.' 'That's a terrible curse! Have you any idea, sir, what misery it will bring you? Neither the gods nor men nor critics have ever forgiven mediocrity in poets: Horace said that.' * 'I know.' 'Are you rich?' 'No.' 'Are you poor?' 'Very.' 'And you are determined to add the affliction of being poor to the ridiculous folly of being a bad poet? You'll waste the whole of your life and one day you'll be old. Old, poor, and a bad poet. Come, sir, that's nothing to be.' 'I can quite see all that, but I can't help myself (At this point Jacques would have said: 'It was written up there, on high.') 'Have you any family?' 'I do.' 'How are they situated?' 'They're jewellers.' 'Would they be prepared to help?' 'Perhaps.' 'Well, then, go and see your parents and put it to them that they might set you up with a bagful of gems, then get on a ship and take yourself off to Pondicherry. You can write bad poems during the voyage. When you get there, you'll make a great deal of money. When you've made your fortune, you can come back and write all the bad poems you want, only don't give them to a publisher : you should never bring ruin on anyone.' It was about twelve years after I gave the young man that advice that he turned up one day. I didn't recognize him. 'It's me, sir,' he said, 'the man you told to go to Pondicherry. I went and there I made a hundred thousand francs. Now I'm back and I've taken up writing poems again. I've brought some for you to see... Are they still bad?' 'As bad as ever. But you've made a decent provision for your future so I can't see why you shouldn't go on writing bad poems.' 'That's exactly what I intend to do.'","And that was word for word the conversation between the surgeon and Jacques’ host and hostess. But what a different complexion could I not have put on the matter by introducing a villain among all these good people. Jacques would have been seen, or rather you would have seen Jacques, on the point of being pulled out of his bed, thrown into the highroad or even a ditch. – Why not killed? Killed, no. I would easily have been able to call someone to his assistance. That someone could have been a soldier from his company but that would have stunk to high heaven of Cleveland.9 Truth, truth. – Truth, you tell me, is often cold, ordinary and dull. For example, your last description of Jacques’ bandaging is true, but what’s interesting about it? Nothing. Agreed. – If it is necessary to be truthful, then let it be like Molière, Regnard, Richardson or Sedaine.10 Truth has its interesting sides which one brings out if one’s a genius. Yes, when one is a genius, but what if one isn’t? – When one isn’t one shouldn’t write. But what if one has the misfortune to resemble a certain poet I sent to Pondicherry? – Who is this poet? This poet… But if you keep on interrupting me, Reader, and if I interrupt myself all the time , what will become of Jacques’ loves? Take my word for it, let us leave our poet there… Jacques’ host and hostess moved away… – No, no, the story of the poet of Pondicherry…11 The surgeon went over to Jacques’ bed… – The story of the poet of Pondicherry, the story of the poet of Pondicherry. One day a young poet came to me, as they do every day… But, Reader, what has that got to do with the journey of Jacques the Fatalist and his master? – The story of the poet of Pondicherry. After the usual social niceties about my wit, my genius, my good taste, my benevolence and other things I didn’t believe a word of even though people have been repeatedly telling me them, and perhaps in all sincerity, for the last twenty years, the young poet took a sheet of paper out of his pocket. ‘Here are some verses.’ ‘Verses?’ ‘Yes, Monsieur, some verses on which I hope you will have the kindness to give me your opinion.’ ‘Do you like truth?’ ‘Yes, Monsieur, and I’m asking you to tell me it.’ ‘Well, you’ll have it.’ ‘What! Are you really stupid enough to think that a poet seeks the truth from you?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And stupid enough to tell him it?’ ‘Certainly.’ ‘Without attenuation?’ ‘Of course. Any attenuation, however artful, would be the most offensive of all insults. Faithfully interpreted it would mean: “You’re a bad poet and, since I don’t believe you are man enough to hear the truth, you’re a worthless man as well.” ’ ‘And has honesty always worked for you?’ ‘Almost always…’ I read my young poet’s odes and told him: ‘Not only is your poetry bad but it is evident that you’ll never write any good poetry.’ ‘Then I must write bad poetry because I can’t stop myself from writing.’ ‘That’s a terrible affliction. Can you not see, Monsieur, what abjection you will fall into? Neither the gods, your fellow men, nor the reviews have ever forgiven mediocrity in a poet. It’s Horace who said that.’12 ‘I know.’ ‘Are you rich?’ ‘No.’ ‘Are you poor?’ ‘Very poor.’ ‘And you are going to add to your poverty the ridicule of being a bad poet. You will have wasted your entire life and before you know it you’ll be old. Old, poor, and a bad poet. Ah! Monsieur, what a combination!’ ‘I can see that but there’s nothing I can do to stop myself.’ (Here Jacques would have said: ‘It was written up above.’) ‘Have you got parents?’ ‘I have.’ ‘What is their position in life?’ ‘They are jewellers.’ ‘Would they help you financially?’ ‘Perhaps.’ ‘Well, go and see your parents and ask them to lend you a small bag of jewels. Embark for Pondicherry and on the way you’ll write terrible poetry but when you get there you’ll make your fortune. When you’ve made your fortune you can come back here and write as much bad poetry as you want to, provided you don’t have any of it printed because you mustn’t ruin anyone else…’ It was around twelve years after I gave this advice to the young man that he reappeared. I didn’t recognize him. ‘It’s me, Monsieur,’ he said to me, ‘the man you sent to Pondicherry. I went there and I made a hundred thousand francs. I have come back and started to write poetry again and here is some which I’ve brought you. Is it still bad?’ ‘It’s still bad, but at least your future is taken care of and I don’t mind if you carry on writing bad poetry.’ ‘That is just what I intend to do…’"
"L’hôtesse, après avoir apaisé cette querelle, qu’elle prit pour la première, et qui n’était pas la centième de la même espèce, et réinstallé Jacques à sa place, s’en alla à ses affaires, et le maître dit à Jacques : « À présent que nous voilà de sang-froid et en état de juger sainement, ne conviendras-tu pas ?","The hostess, after having appeased this quarrel, which she took for the first, and which was not the hundredth of the same species, and reinstalled Jacques in his place, went about his business, and the master said to Jacques: ""Now that we are cool and able to judge soundly, won't you agree?""","The landlady, having put an end to their quarrel, which she assumed was the first, though in fact there had been more than a hundred like it, and having secured Jacques's reinstatement, then went about her business while the Master said to Jacques: 'I'd say we've calmed down and can consider these matters objectively. What do you say?'","After the hostess had calmed their quarrel, which she took for the first of its kind when there had been more than a hundred like it, and reinstated Jacques in his former position, she carried on about her business and the master said to Jacques: ‘Now that we have calmed down and are in a state where we can make clear judgements, will you not acknowledge it?’"

Lorsqu’il entendait la mère se plaindre de sa fille, il aggravait les torts de celle-ci, et irritait le ressentiment de l’autre. Si c’était la fille qui se plaignît de sa mère, il lui insinuait que la puissance des pères et mères sur leurs enfants était limitée, et que, si la persécution de sa mère était poussée jusqu’à un certain point, il ne serait peut-être pas impossible de la soustraire à une autorité tyrannique. Puis il lui donnait pour pénitence de revenir à confesse.","Then he worked in confession court to throw out the division between mother and daughter.

Then he gave her as a penance to return to confession.","Next, using the weapon of the confessional, he proceeded to set mother against daughter. When he heard the mother complain of her daughter, he exaggerated the wrongs of the one and fomented the resentment of the other. If it was the daughter who complained of her mother, he insinuated that there was a limit to the power mothers and fathers have over their children and that, should her mother's persecution reach a certain point, it might not be impossible for the daughter to cast off the yoke of a tyrannical parent. Then, for her penance, he would tell her to come back to confession.","Next he sought, through the confessional, to sow discord between the mother and the daughter. When he heard the mother criticize the daughter he exaggerated the faults of the daughter and increased the resentment of the mother.

"Je vous ai dit : premièrement ; or, dire un premièrement, c’est annoncer au moins un secondement. Secondement donc… Écoutez-moi, ne m’écoutez pas, je parlerai tout seul… Le capitaine de Jacques et son camarade pouvaient être tourmentés d’une jalousie violente et secrète : c’est un sentiment que l’amitié n’éteint pas toujours. Rien de si difficile à pardonner que le mérite. N’appréhendaient-ils pas un passe-droit, qui les aurait également offensés tous deux ? Sans s’en douter, ils cherchaient d’avance à se délivrer d’un concurrent dangereux, ils se tâtaient pour l’occasion à venir. Mais comment avoir cette idée de celui qui cède si généreusement son commandement de place à son ami indigent ? Il le cède, il est vrai ; mais s’il en eût été privé, peut-être l’eût-il revendiqué à la pointe de l’épée. Un passe-droit entre les militaires, s’il n’honore pas celui qui en profite, déshonore son rival. Mais laissons tout cela, et disons que c’était leur coin de folie. Est-ce que chacun n’a pas le sien ? Celui de nos deux officiers fut pendant plusieurs siècles celui de toute l’Europe ; on l’appelait l’esprit de chevalerie. Toute cette multitude brillante, armée de pied en cap, décorée de diverses livrées d’amour, caracolant sur des palefrois, la lance au poing, la visière haute ou baissée, se regardant fièrement, se mesurant de l’œil, se menaçant, se renversant sur la poussière, jonchant l’espace d’un vaste tournoi des éclats d’armes brisées, n’étaient que des amis jaloux du mérite en vogue. Ces amis, au moment où ils tenaient leurs lances en arrêt, chacun à l’extrémité de la carrière, et qu’ils avaient pressé de l’aiguillon les flancs de leurs coursiers, devenaient les plus terribles ennemis ; ils fondaient les uns sur les autres avec la même fureur qu’ils auraient portée sur un champ de bataille. Eh bien ! nos deux officiers n’étaient que deux paladins, nés de nos jours, avec les mœurs des anciens. Chaque vertu et chaque vice se montrent et passent de mode. La force du corps eut son temps, l’adresse aux exercices eut le sien. La bravoure est tantôt plus, tantôt moins considérée ; plus elle est commune, moins on en est vain, moins on en fait l’éloge. Suivez les inclinations des hommes, et vous en remarquerez qui semblent être venus au monde trop tard : ils sont d’un autre siècle. Et qu’est-ce qui empêcherait de croire que nos deux militaires avaient été engagés dans ces combats journaliers et périlleux par le seul désir de trouver le côté faible de son rival et d’obtenir la supériorité sur lui ? Les duels se répètent dans la société sous toutes sortes de formes, entre des prêtres, entre des magistrats, entre des littérateurs, entre des philosophes ; chaque état a sa lance et ses chevaliers, et nos assemblées les plus respectables, les plus amusantes, ne sont que de petits tournois où quelquefois on porte des livrées de l’amour dans le fond de son cœur, sinon sur l’épaule. Plus il y a d’assistants, plus la joute est vive ; la présence de femmes y pousse la chaleur et l’opiniâtreté à toute outrance, et la honte d’avoir succombé devant elles ne s’oublie guère.","I told you: first; now, to say a first is to announce at least a second. Secondly, then… Listen to me, don't listen to me, I'll speak on my own… Jacques' captain and his comrade could be tormented by a violent and secret jealousy: it's a feeling that friendship doesn't always extinguish. . Nothing is so difficult to forgive as merit. Weren't they apprehensive of a pass, which would have offended both of them equally? Without suspecting it, they were seeking in advance to get rid of a dangerous competitor, they were groping for the opportunity to come. But how to have this idea of the one who so generously yields his place of command to his needy friend? He yields it, it is true; but if he had been deprived of it, perhaps he would have claimed it at the point of the sword. A free pass between the military, if it does not honor the one who benefits from it, dishonors his rival. But let's leave all that, and say that was their corner of madness. Doesn't everyone have their own? That of our two officers was for several centuries that of all Europe; it was called the spirit of chivalry. All this brilliant multitude, armed from head to foot, decorated with various liveries of love, prancing on palfreys, lance in hand, visor raised or lowered, looking at each other proudly, measuring each other with their eyes, threatening each other, spilling over the dust, strewing the space of a vast tournament with the shards of broken weapons, were only jealous friends of fashionable merit. These friends, at the moment when they held their spears in rest, each at the extremity of the quarry, and had pressed the goad against the flanks of their steeds, became the most terrible enemies; they swooped down on each other with the same fury they would have carried on a battlefield. Well ! our two officers were only two paladins, born in our day, with the morals of the ancients. Every virtue and every vice shows itself and goes out of fashion. The strength of the body had its time, the skill in the exercises had its time. Bravery is sometimes more, sometimes less considered; the more common it is, the less we are vain about it, the less we praise it. Follow the inclinations of men, and you will notice some who seem to have come into the world too late: they are from another century. And what would prevent us from believing that our two soldiers had been engaged in these daily and perilous fights by the sole desire to find the weak side of his rival and obtain superiority over him? Duels are repeated in society in all sorts of forms, between priests, between magistrates, between writers, between philosophers; each state has its lance and its knights, and our most respectable, most amusing assemblies are only little tournaments where sometimes one wears the livery of love in the depths of one's heart, if not on one's shoulder. The more assistants there are, the livelier the contest; the presence of women pushes the heat and the stubbornness to all excess, and the shame of having succumbed to them is hardly forgotten.","A while back I said 'in the first place'. Now an 'in the first place' is a prelude to at least an 'in the second place'. So, in the second place... Listen or don't listen, I shall go on talking to myself... Jacques's Captain and his friend could have been riven by violent, unconscious feelings of jealousy, friendship does not always rule out jealousy. Nothing is harder to forgive in others than merit. Was not each of them afraid the other might be promoted over his head, which would have offended both of them? Unknowingly they were trying to remove a dangerous competitor from the running: they were limbering up for the confrontation to come. But how can anyone think such a thing of the one who so generously surrendered his post of adjutant to his impoverished friend? He stood down, it's true, but if he'd been denied the posting, he might have supported his own claim to it with the point of his sword. In the army, an unfair promotion does no honour to the soldier to whose advantage it falls and it dishonours his rival. But let's not go into that any further. Let's just say that it was their own brand of folly. Do we not all have our quirks? The folly of those two officers was for several centuries the folly of the whole of Europe: it was called the spirit of chivalry. The brilliant, multitudinous cohort of men armed from head to foot, sporting assorted tokens of love, prancing on palfreys, lances under their arms, visors raised or lowered, proudly glaring around them, sizing each other up at a glance, issuing challenges, biting the dust, littering the field of one vast jousting match with splinters of broken weapons— were nothing more than friends jealously wedded to the particular style of merit that was then the fashion. At the instant they couched their lances, each at his end of the lists, at the moment they dug their spurs into the ribs of their chargers, these friends turned into the most terrible enemies. They bore down on each other with as much fury as if they were on the field of battle. Well, our two officers were simply two knights of yore, born into our own times but with the outlook of the olde worlde. Every virtue and every vice comes into fashion and goes out of fashion. Physical strength had its day, and skill at arms likewise. The spirit of derring-do is valued in one era and undervalued the next: the more common it is, the less arrogant men are and the less fuss they make of it. If you examine the impulses which drive them, you'll find some who were clearly born too late. They belong in another century. And what's to stop us believing that these two soldiers had engaged in dangerous duels every day for no other reason than because each wished to find his rival's weak spot and establish his superiority? Duels occur endlessly in society in all sorts of forms—between priests, between politicians, between writers, between philosophers. Every group and condition of men has its lances and its champions, and our most serious or amusing gatherings are in reality small-scale jousts in which love-tokens are worn in the heart if not on the sleeve. The larger the audience, the livelier the combat. The presence of women stokes the heat of battle and the combative spirit to absurd heights, and the shame of coming to grief while the ladies are watching is something that's rarely forgotten.","I told you in the first place… Now, when a person says: ‘In the first place…’ it is a way of announcing at least a second place… So, in the second place… listen to me… All right, then, don’t listen to me… I’ll speak to myself… Jacques’ Captain and his friend could have been tormented by a violent and secret jealousy. It is a feeling which friendship does not always extinguish. Nothing is so difficult to forgive as someone else’s worth. Were they not perhaps afraid that one of them would be unfairly promoted, which would offend both of them equally? Without being conscious of doing so, each was trying pre-emptively to rid himself of a dangerous rival. They were sounding each other out for the opportunity. But how can one think such a thing of a man who so generously gave up his Commandant’s post to an impecunious friend? He gave it up, that is true, but if he had not been awarded it in the first place, he might perhaps have claimed it at swordpoint. In the army an unjustified promotion, even if it does not bring honour to the person who profits from it, dishonours his rival. But let us leave all that. Let us just say that it was their particular kind of madness. And which of us does not have his own? The folly of our two officers was for several centuries that of the whole of Europe and used to be called the spirit of chivalry. That brilliant multitude, armed from head to toe, decked out in the favours of their various ladies, on their prancing chargers, lances in hand, visors raised, visors lowered, looking at each other proudly, sizing each other up, threatening each other, casting each other down in the dust, strewing vast tournament-fields with splinters of their broken arms, were all just friends, striving jealously for the particular type of merit which happened then to be in vogue. At the moment when, at opposite ends of the arena, they raised their lances to the ready, at the moment when they pressed their spurs into the flanks of their chargers, these friends became the most terrible enemies. They would descend on each other with the same fury they would have displayed on a battlefield. And so our two officers were nothing more than two knights errant who were born in our time with the mores of former times. Every human virtue and every vice has been fashionable for a while and then unfashionable. Physical strength had its moment. So did martial skills. Bravery is sometimes more and sometimes less well thought of. The more a thing is common the less it is valued and the less it is praised. Examine the proclivities of men and you will note some who appear to have come into the world too late. They belong to another century. But what is to prevent us from believing that our two soldiers engaged in their perilous daily conflicts purely out of a desire to find their rival’s weak spot and gain superiority over him? Duels recur in many forms in our society – between priests, between magistrates, between men of letters, between philosophers. Every occupation has its knights and its lances. Even our most serious or amusing assemblies are no more than miniature tournaments into which people sometimes carry the colours of their ladies, if not on their shoulders, at least in their hearts. The more people there are present, the more lively the contest. The presence of women makes the contest extremely intense and hard fought. The shame of having been beaten in front of women is hardly ever forgotten."

J’avais fait mes adieux à la doctoresse et j’allais monter en carrosse, lorsque cette femme, s’approchant de moi, me tire par la manche, et me prie de passer dans un coin de la chambre, qu’elle avait un mot à me dire. « Là, notre ami, ajouta-t-elle, vous n’avez point, je crois, à vous plaindre de nous ; le docteur vous a sauvé une jambe, moi, je vous ai bien soigné, et j’espère qu’au château vous ne nous oublierez pas.","I allow myself to be persuaded; I get up, I get dressed, they take me under the arm. I had bade farewell to the doctor and was about to get into the carriage, when this woman, approaching me, pulled me by the sleeve, and begged me to pass into a corner of the room, that she had a word to tell me. “There, our friend,” she added, “you have nothing, I believe, to complain about us; the doctor saved your leg, I took good care of you, and I hope you won't forget us at the chateau.","I allow myself to be prevailed upon, I get out of bed, dress, and am led away by the arm. I'd said my goodbyes to the doctor's wife and was making my way to the carriage, when she comes up to me, tugs at my sleeve, and asks will I step aside into a corner of the room because she has something to say to me. 'There now, lad,' says she, 'I don't think you've got any reason to complain about what we've done for you, have you? The doctor saved your leg and I've seen to your every need. I hope you won't forget that when you get to the chateau.'","I let him persuade me. I got up and dressed and he took me by the arm. I had said goodbye to the surgeon’s wife and I was about to get into the carriage when she came up to me, pulled me by the sleeve, and asked me to go over into the corner of the room, because she had something she wanted to say to me. ‘Now, my friend,’ she said, ‘you haven’t got any complaints about us, have you?

"Ce fut alors qu’il arriva dans la même maison un jeune Père qui passait pour la merveille de l’ordre au tribunal et dans la chaire ; il s’appelait le Père Ange. Il avait de beaux yeux, un beau visage, un bras et des mains à modeler. Le voilà qui prêche, qui prêche, qui confesse, qui confesse ; voilà les vieux directeurs quittés par leurs dévotes ; voilà ces dévotes attachées au jeune Père Ange ; voilà que les veilles de dimanches et de grandes fêtes la boutique du Père Ange est environnée de pénitents et de pénitentes, et que les vieux Pères attendaient inutilement pratique dans leurs boutiques désertes ; ce qui les chagrinait beaucoup… Mais, monsieur, si je laissais là l’histoire de frère Jean et que je reprisse celle de mes amours, cela serait peut-être plus gai.","It was then that there arrived in the same house a young Father who passed for the marvel of order in the tribunal and in the pulpit; his name was Father Angel. He had beautiful eyes, a beautiful face, an arm and hands to model. There he is preaching, preaching, confessing, confessing; here are the old directors left by their devotees; here are these devotees attached to the young Father Angel; Behold, on the eves of Sundays and major feasts, Father Ange's shop is surrounded by penitents and penitents, and the old Fathers waited in vain in their deserted shops; which saddened them very much... But, sir, if I left the story of Brother Jean there and resumed that of my loves, it would perhaps be more cheerful.","It was then that a young monk arrived in the monastery. He was considered to be the order's brightest star in both the confessional and the pulpit. His name was Pere Ange. * He had lustrous eyes, a handsome face, and arms and hands to delight a sculptor. He began preaching, he gave confessions galore. The old priests were deserted in droves by the women in the congregation who flocked to Pere Ange instead. Every evening before Sundays and feast days, Pere Ange's confessional was besieged by penitents of both sexes while the older fathers were left to kick their heels in their empty booths, which made them very cross... But it would be less depressing, sir, if I abandon the story of Frere Jean and took up the story of my love-life again.","Now at about this time there arrived at the monastery a young monk who was accepted as the wonder of the order in the confessional and the pulpit. He was called Friar Angel. He had beautiful eyes, a handsome face, and the arms and hands of a sculptor’s model. There he was preaching sermons and more sermons, hearing confessions and more confessions and the old spiritual directors were abandoned by their female congregation who flocked to the young Friar Angel. The eve of every Sunday and feast day, Friar Angel’s confessional was surrounded by more and more penitents while the old fathers waited fruitlessly for business in their deserted confessionals which upset them a great deal… But, Monsieur, if perhaps I left the story of Friar Jean and carried on with the story of my loves, it might be more cheerful."
"Comment un homme de sens, qui a des mœurs, qui se pique de philosophie, peut-il s’amuser à débiter des contes de cette obscénité ? – Premièrement, lecteur, ce ne sont pas des contes, c’est une histoire, et je ne me sens pas plus coupable, et peut-être moins, quand j’écris les sottises de Jacques, que Suétone quand il nous transmet les débauches de Tibère. Cependant vous lisez Suétone, et vous ne lui faites aucun reproche. Pourquoi ne froncez-vous pas le sourcil à Catulle, à Martial, à Horace, à Juvénal, à Pétrone, à La Fontaine et à tant d’autres ? Pourquoi ne dites-vous pas au stoïcien Sénèque : Quel besoin avons-nous de la crapule de votre esclave aux miroirs concaves ? » Pourquoi n’avez-vous de l’indulgence que pour les morts ? Si vous fléchissiez un peu à cette partialité, vous verriez qu’elle naît de quelque principe vicieux. Si vous êtes innocent, vous ne me lirez pas ; si vous êtes corrompu, vous me lirez sans conséquence. Et puis, si ce que je vous dis là ne vous satisfait pas, ouvrez la préface de Jean Baptiste Rousseau, et vous y trouverez mon apologie. Quel est celui d’entre vous qui osât blâmer Voltaire d’avoir composé la Pucelle ? Aucun. Vous avez donc deux balances pour les actions des hommes ? « Mais, dites-vous, la Pucelle de Voltaire est un chef-d’œuvre ! – Tant pis, puisqu’on ne l’en lira que davantage : Et votre Jacques n’est qu’une insipide rhapsodie de faits les uns réels, les autres imaginés, écrits sans grâce et distribués sans ordre : Tant mieux, mon Jacques en sera moins lu. De quelque côté que vous vous tourniez, vous avez tort. Si mon ouvrage est bon, il vous fera plaisir ; s’il est mauvais, il ne fera point de mal. Point de livre plus innocent qu’un mauvais livre. Je m’amuse à écrire sous des noms empruntés les sottises que vous faites ; vos sottises me font rire ; mon écrit vous donne de l’humeur. Lecteur, à vous parler franchement, je trouve que le plus méchant de nous deux, ce n’est pas moi. Que je serais satisfait s’il m’était aussi facile de me garantir de vos noirceurs, qu’à vous de l’ennui ou du danger de mon ouvrage ! Vilains hypocrites, laissez-moi en repos. F…tez comme des ânes débâtés ; mais permettez-moi que je dise f…tre ; je vous passe l’action, passez-moi le mot. Vous prononcez hardiment tuer, voler, trahir, et l’autre vous ne l’oseriez qu’entre les dents ! Est-ce que moins vous exhalez de ces prétendues impuretés en paroles, plus il vous en reste dans la pensée ? Et que vous a fait l’action génitale, si naturelle, si nécessaire et si juste, pour en exclure le signe de vos entretiens, et pour imaginer que votre bouche, vos yeux et vos oreilles en seraient souillés ? Il est bon que les expressions les moins usitées, les moins écrites, les mieux tues soient les mieux sues et les plus généralement connues ; aussi cela est ; aussi le mot futuo n’est-il pas moins familier que le mot pain ; nul âge ne l’ignore, nul idiome n’en est privé ! Il a mille synonymes dans toutes les langues, il s’imprime en chacune sans être exprimé, sans voix, sans figure, et le sexe qui le fait le plus a usage de le taire le plus. Je vous entends encore, vous vous écriez : « Fi, le cynique ! Fi, l’impudent ! Fi, le sophiste !… » Courage, insultez bien un auteur estimable que vous avez sans cesse entre les mains, et dont je ne suis ici que le traducteur. La licence de son style m’est presque un garant de la pureté de ses mœurs ; c’est Montaigne. Lasciva est nobis pagina, vita proba.","How can a man of sense, who has morals, who prides himself on philosophy, have fun spouting tales of this obscenity? – First, reader, these are not tales, they are a story, and I feel no more guilty, and perhaps less, when I write the foolishness of James, than Suetonius when he transmits the debauchery to us. of Tiberius. However, you read Suetonius, and you do not reproach him. Why don't you frown at Catullus, Martial, Horace, Juvenal, Petronius, La Fontaine and so many others? Why don't you say to the Stoic Seneca: What need do we have of the scoundrel of your slave with concave mirrors? “Why do you have indulgence only for the dead? If you yielded a little to this partiality, you would see that it arises from some vicious principle. If you are innocent, you will not read me; if you are corrupt, you will read me without consequence. And then, if what I am telling you here does not satisfy you, open the preface of Jean Baptiste Rousseau, and you will find my apology there. Who among you would dare to blame Voltaire for having composed La Pucelle? No. So you have two scales for the actions of men? “But, you say, the Maid of Voltaire is a masterpiece! – Too bad, since we will only read more of it: And your Jacques is only an insipid rhapsody of facts, some real, others imagined, written without grace and distributed without order: So much the better, my Jacques in will be read less. Whichever way you turn, you're wrong. If my work is good, it will please you; if it is bad, it will do no harm. No book more innocent than a bad book. I enjoy writing under borrowed names the stupid things you do; your foolishness makes me laugh; my writing gives you humor. Reader, frankly speaking to you, I find that the nastiest of us is not me. How satisfied I would be if it were as easy for me to protect myself from your blackness as you from the boredom or danger of my work! Naughty hypocrites, leave me alone. Party like limp donkeys; but allow me to say f…tre; I pass the action to you, pass the word to me. You boldly pronounce kill, steal, betray, and the other you would only dare to between the teeth! Does the less you exhale of these so-called impurities in words, the more you have left in your thoughts? And what did the genital action, so natural, so necessary and so just, do to you to exclude the sign of it from your conversations, and to imagine that your mouth, your eyes and your ears would be soiled by it? It is good that the least used, the least written, the best silenced expressions are the best known and the most generally known; also this is; also the word futuo is no less familiar than the word bread; no age is unaware of it, no idiom is deprived of it! It has a thousand synonyms in all languages, it imprints itself in each one without being expressed, without voice, without figure, and the sex that does it the most has the habit of keeping it silent the most. I can still hear you, you exclaim: “Fi, the cynic! Fi, the impudent! Fi, the sophist!…” Courage, insult well an estimable author whom you constantly have in your hands, and of whom I am only the translator here. The license of his style is almost a guarantee to me of the purity of his morals; it is Montaigne. Lasciva est nobis pagina, vita proba.","What does a grown man, an intelligent man, an honest and decent man who fancies himself as a philosopher, think he's playing at, telling disgusting stories like this? First of all, Reader, they aren't stories. This is a chronicle, and I don't feel any more guilty—perhaps less— when I write down Jacques's follies than Suetonius when he chronicled the debauched life of Tiberius for us. * Yet you read Suetonius and you don't complain about him. Why don't you glower at Catullus, Martial, Horace, Juvenal, Petronius, La Fontaine, and many, many more? * Why don't you tell Seneca the Stoic: 'We're not interested in your loathsome slaves and their magnifying mirrors'? * Why is it that you only make allowances for dead authors? If you stop a moment and think about this one-sided view of yours, you'll see that it's based on a false premiss. If you are pure in heart, you will not read my book; if you are depraved, you will not be affected by reading me. But if you are not convinced by this argument, have a look at what Jean-Baptiste Rousseau says in the preface to his works and there you will find the case for my defence. * Which of you would dare take Voltaire to task for writing La Pucelle? * Not one of you. Doesn't it follow, therefore, that you use two different sets of scales for judging men's actions? But, you say, La Pucelle is a masterpiece. Good. That means more people will read it. Whereas your Jacques is a tasteless mishmash of things that happen, some of them true, others made up, written without style and served up like a dog's breakfast. Good. That means not many people will read Jacques. Look, Reader, whichever view you take, you get it wrong. If my book is any good, you'll like it; if it's bad, it won't do you any harm. There is no book more innocent than a bad book. I rather enjoy—pausing only to change the names—writing down the stupid things you do. Your follies make me laugh, but what I write offends you. To be perfectly frank, Reader, I'd say that of the two of us the more unkind is not me. I'd be only too happy if it were as easy for me to defend myself against your aspersions as it is for you to defend yourself against being bored or imperilled by my book. Just leave me alone, you miserable hypocrites. Carry on fucking like rabbits, but you've got to let me say fuck : I grant you the action and you let me have the word. Words like 'kill' and 'rob' and 'betray' come boldly to your lips, but you don't dare speak that word out loud , you just say it under your breath. Could it be that the fewer so-called obscenities you come out with, the more numerous they remain in your thoughts? What harm were you ever done by something as natural, necessary, and right as genital activity, that you should wish to exclude all mention of it from your conversation and imagine that your mouth and eyes and ears would be polluted if it weren't? It is good that the words which are spoken the most often, written the least frequently, and the most effectively curbed should be the best known and the most widely used—as such indeed is the case. For futuo* is no less common than the word 'bread'. It is known to every age and idiom, there are countless synonyms for it in every tongue known to man, it looms large in every language but is never directly expressed, being without voice or outward shape, and the sex which indulges the thing most is the one accustomed to say the word least. I can still hear you objecting: ' Oh, what a cynic! The impudence! This is sophistry!' That's right, go ahead—insult a revered author who you are forever reading and of whom I am here merely the mouthpiece: I mean Montaigne. * You might say that the freedom of his language is the guarantee of the purity of my morals. Lasciva est nobis pagina, vita proba*","How can a man of wisdom and morality, who fancies himself as something of a philosopher, amuse himself telling tales as obscene as this? Well, firstly you must remember that these are not tales. It is a true story, and I certainly do not feel more guilty – and perhaps even less – when I write about Jacques’ follies than Suetonius when he recorded for us the orgies of Tiberius. Moreover you read Suetonius without reproaching him. Why do you not frown at Catullus, Martial, Horace, Juvenal, Petronius, La Fontaine and so many others? Why don’t you tell the stoic Seneca: ‘We don’t need to hear about the debauchery of your slave with his concave mirrors?’ Why is it that you are only indulgent with dead writers? If you were to reflect a little on this partiality you will see that it is born of a false assumption. If you are innocent you will not read my work. If, on the other hand, you are depraved, you may read me without consequence. And then if you are not satisfied by what I say, open the preface to the works of Jean-Baptiste Rousseau and you will find my apologia. Who is there amongst you who dares to criticize Voltaire for writing La Pucelle?60 Nobody. So you have, therefore, two standards for assessing the actions of men. – But, I hear you protest, Voltaire’s Pucelle is a masterpiece. So much the worse since people will read it more. – And your Jacques is nothing more than a tasteless farrago of facts, some real, some imaginary, written without elegance and arranged without order. So much the better: Jacques will be less read. Whichever way you turn you are wrong. If my work is good it will please you. If it is bad it won’t do you any harm. There is no book that is more innocent than a bad book. I enjoy writing up under assumed names the follies I have seen you commit. Your follies make me laugh and my writings annoy you. To speak to you frankly, Reader, I find that you are the more wicked of the two of us. How satisfied would I be if it were as easy for me to protect myself from your calumny as it is for you to protect yourself from the boredom or the danger of my work! Filthy hypocrites. Leave me in peace. Fuck away like unsaddled asses but allow me to say ‘fuck’. I allow you the action. Allow me the word. You boldly use words like ‘kill’, ‘steal’, ‘betray’ all the time but only dare to pronounce that word under your breath. Might it be that the less you allow such supposed impurities to pass your lips the more they remain in your thoughts? And what has a thing so natural, so right and so necessary as sexual intercourse done to you that you should exclude the word for it from your conversation and imagine that your mouth, your eyes and your ears will be sullied by it? It is a good thing that the expressions we use least, write least, and repress most are the best known and the most widely understood. Thus the proper term is as common as the word ‘bread’. It is present in every age in every idiom. There are a thousand synonyms in all languages and it impresses itself in each of us without being expressed, without voice and without shape, and the sex which does the thing the most is the one which says the word the least. I can still hear you exclaiming: ‘Oh! What a vulgar man! Oh! What a cynic! Oh! What a sophist!’ Go on. Heap your insults on an estimable author who is always in your hands and whom I only translate here. To me the freedom of his style is almost the guarantee of the purity of his morals. It is Montaigne. Lasciva est nobis pagina vita proba.61"

Do you know that for ten years I was the resource of the military, in all good and honor? I have obliged many who would have had great difficulty in campaigning without me. They are good people, I have nothing to complain about, nor them about me. Never tickets; they sometimes kept me waiting; after two, three, four years my money came back to me…”","Good idea. Some of the heads I've turned were worth it, including or excluding yours. Did you know I was banker to the military for ten years, true as I'm sitting here? I advanced cash to quite a few soldiers who wouldn't have got through their campaigns if it hadn't been for me. They were good lads and I've got nothing against them, nor they against me neither. I never asked for security. They kept me waiting sometimes two, three, four years, but I always got my money back.","Willingly. Some of them were worth it, even if I don’t take you into account. Do you know that for ten whole years I was the officers’ financial standby, everything above board. I must have helped scores of them who would have had an awful job getting themselves kitted out for the year’s campaigning without me. But they were good men and I’ve no cause to complain about any of them, nor them of me. I never asked for pledges, though sometimes they used to make me wait. But at the end of two, three or four years my money was returned…"

"En prison ; et puis voilà un procès abominable. Il ne s’agissait rien moins que d’épouser Mlle Agathe ; les parents ne voulaient entendre à aucun accommodement. Dès le matin, le chevalier m’apparut dans ma retraite. Il savait tout. Agathe était désolée ; ses parents étaient engagés ; il avait essuyé les plus cruels reproches sur la perfide connaissance qu’il leur avait donnée ; c’était lui qui était la première cause de leur malheur et du déshonneur de leur fille ; ces pauvres gens faisaient pitié. Il avait demandé à parler à Agathe en particulier ; il ne l’avait pas obtenu sans peine. Agathe avait pensé lui arracher les yeux, elle l’avait appelé des noms les plus odieux. Il s’y attendait ; il avait laissé tomber ses fureurs ; après quoi il avait tâché de l’amener à quelque chose de raisonnable ; mais cette fille disait une chose à laquelle, ajoutait le chevalier, je ne sais point de réplique : « Mon père et ma mère m’ont surprise avec votre ami ; faut-il leur apprendre que, en couchant avec lui, je croyais coucher avec vous ?… » Il lui répondait : « Mais en bonne foi, croyez-vous que mon ami puisse vous épouser ?… Non, disait-elle, c’est vous, indigne, c’est vous, infâme, qui devriez être condamné. »","In prison ; and then there is an abominable trial. It was nothing less than marrying Mademoiselle Agathe; the parents did not want to entertain any accommodation. In the morning the knight appeared to me in my retreat. He knew everything. Agathe was sorry; his parents were engaged; he had suffered the most cruel reproaches on the perfidious knowledge which he had given them; it was he who was the first cause of their misfortune and of the dishonor of their daughter; these poor people were pitiful. He had asked to speak to Agathe in particular; he had not obtained it easily. Agathe had thought of gouging out his eyes, she had called him the most odious names. He expected it; he had given up his rages; after which he had tried to bring her to something reasonable; but this girl said something to which, added the chevalier, I know no reply: “My father and my mother surprised me with your friend; should we teach them that, by sleeping with him, I thought I was sleeping with you?…” He answered her: “But in good faith, do you believe that my friend can marry you?… No, she said, it is you, unworthy, it is you, infamous, who should be condemned. »","To prison. And then the terms of a gruesome suit were put to me. What it involved was nothing less than marriage to Mademoiselle Agathe. Her parents refused to settle for anything less. Next morning, the Chevalier appeared in my cell. He knew everything. Agathe was distraught and her parents furious. He'd been subjected to the most bitter recriminations for having introduced them to such a devious acquaintance. He it was who'd been the original cause of their misfortune and their daughter's disgrace. They were in a terrible state. He'd asked if he could speak to Agathe in private, and this had been granted, though only after considerable resistance. At first Agathe tried to scratch his eyes out and had called him the most odious names. He'd been expecting this and had waited until her fury blew itself out, after which he had tried to make her see reason. 'But then she said something to which', said the Chevalier, 'I'm not sure how I should respond.' ' ""My father and my mother discovered me with your friend,"" she said. ""Shall I tell them that though I was found in bed with him I thought I was in bed with you?"" ' ""But in all honesty,"" said I, ""do you really think my friend should marry you?"" ' ""No,"" said she, ""you're the one, you brute, who should be made to do it."" '","To prison. And then what an abominable court case. It was nothing less than a question of marrying Mlle Agathe. Her parents didn’t want to listen to any arrangement. At daybreak the Chevalier appeared in my retreat. He knew everything. Agathe was devastated. Her parents were enraged. He had been subjected to the most cruel reproaches because of the perfidious acquaintance he had introduced to them. It was he who was the primary cause of their unhappiness and their daughter’s dishonour. The poor parents were a pitiful sight. He had asked to speak to Agathe alone, which he eventually – though not without difficulty – succeeded in doing. Agathe had almost torn his eyes out. She had called him the most odious names. He had been prepared for it and he waited for her fury to subside, after which he tried to bring her to a more reasonable frame of mind. ‘But this girl said one thing,’ added the Chevalier, ‘to which I do not know the answer: “My father and my mother surprised me with your friend. Should I tell them that when I was sleeping with him I thought I was sleeping with you?” ’ He replied: ‘In all honesty, do you think that my friend could marry you?’ ‘No,’ she said, ‘it is you, you unworthy wretch, who ought to be condemned to do so.’"

"Si je vous le nommais, vous sauriez tout. Arrivé là, j’entrai dans un cabaret, je me reposai, je me rafraîchis. Le jour commençait à baisser, et je me disposais à regagner le gîte lorsque, de la maison où j’étais, j’entendis une femme qui poussait les cris les plus aigus. Je sortis ; on s’était attroupé autour d’elle. Elle était à terre, elle s’arrachait les cheveux ; elle disait, en montrant les débris d’une grande cruche : « Je suis ruinée, je suis ruinée pour un mois ; pendant ce temps qui est-ce qui nourrira mes pauvres enfants ? Cet intendant, qui a l’âme plus dure qu’une pierre, ne me fera pas grâce d’un sou. Que je suis malheureuse ! Je suis ruinée, je suis ruinée !… » Tout le monde la plaignait ; je n’entendais autour d’elle que : « La pauvre femme ! » mais personne ne mettait la main dans la poche. Je m’approchai brusquement et lui dis : « Ma bonne, qu’est-ce qui vous est arrivé ? – Ce qui m’est arrivé ! est-ce que vous ne le voyez pas ? On m’avait envoyé acheter une cruche d’huile : j’ai fait un faux pas, je suis tombée, ma cruche s’est cassée, et voilà l’huile dont elle était pleine… » Dans ce moment survinrent les petits enfants de cette femme, ils étaient presque nus, et les mauvais vêtements de leur mère montraient toute la misère de la famille ; et la mère et les enfants se mirent à crier. Tel que vous me voyez, il en fallait dix fois moins pour me toucher ; mes entrailles s’émurent de compassion, les larmes me vinrent aux yeux. Je demandai à cette femme, d’une voix entrecoupée, pour combien il y avait d’huile dans sa cruche. « Pour combien ? me répondit-elle en levant les mains en haut. Pour neuf francs, pour plus que je ne saurais gagner en un mois… » À l’instant, déliant ma bourse et lui jetant deux gros écus : « Tenez, ma bonne, lui dis-je, en voilà douze… » et, sans attendre ses remerciements, je repris le chemin du village.","If I named him to you, you would know everything. Arrived there, I entered a cabaret, I rested, I refreshed myself. The day was beginning to fade, and I was preparing to return to the lodging when, from the house where I was, I heard a woman who uttered the most acute cries. I went out ; people had crowded around her. She was on the ground, she was tearing her hair out; she said, pointing to the remains of a large pitcher: “I am ruined, I am ruined for a month; meanwhile who will feed my poor children? This steward, who has a soul harder than a stone, will not spare me a penny. How unhappy I am! I am ruined, I am ruined!…” Everyone felt sorry for her; I only heard around her: “Poor woman! but no one put their hand in their pocket. I approached abruptly and said to her: “My good, what happened to you? - What happened to me ! don't you see it? I had been sent to buy a jug of oil: I took a false step, I fell, my jug broke, and here was the oil with which it was full…” At this moment the little children of this woman, they were almost naked, and their mother's bad clothes showed all the misery of the family; and the mother and the children began to cry. As you see me, it took ten times less to touch me; my entrails are stirred with compassion, tears came to my eyes. I asked this woman, in a broken voice, how much oil there was in her jug. "" For how much ? she replied, raising her hands up. For nine francs, for more than I can earn in a month..."" Instantly, untying my purse and throwing her two large crowns: ""Here, my good, I said to her, here are twelve..."" and, without waiting for his thanks, I took the road back to the village.","if I told you that, you'd know everything. When I got there, I went into a tavern, sat down, and had something to drink. The light began to fade and I was getting ready to return to my lodging when, from the room in the inn where I was sitting, I heard a woman screaming, very loud. I went out into the street. A crowd had gathered round her. She was lying on the ground, tearing her hair, and, pointing to the shattered remains of a large earthenware pitcher, saying: 'Now I've got nothing, no money for a month! And who will feed my poor children all that time? That steward has a heart that's solid flint and he'll want his money down to the last penny. Oh, I'm so wretched. I'm ruined! Ruined!!' Everyone felt sorry for her and on all sides I heard them muttering 'Poor woman!' but nobody put his hand in his pocket. Without more ado, I went up to her and said: 'My good woman, what's happened here?' 'What's happened? Can't you see? I was sent to fetch a pitcher of oil. I tripped and fell, the pitcher broke, and here's all the oil that was in it...' Just then, the woman's young children appeared. They were practically naked and their mother's ragged clothes showed just how poor the whole family was. Then both mother and infants started bawling their eyes out. True as I'm standing here now, it wouldn't have taken a tenth as much to move me to tears. My innards churned with compassion and tears came to my eyes. Brokenly, I asked the woman how much the oil in her pitcher had been worth. 'How much was it worth?' she said, raising her arms to heaven. ' It was worth nine francs—more than I can earn in a month.' I immediately opened my purse and tossed two crowns to her: 'Here,' said I, 'there's twelve,' and not stopping to hear her thanks I headed back towards my village.","If I told you that you’d know everything. Once I got there I went into an inn, rested awhile and took some refreshment. Night was beginning to fall and I was just about to start out on the journey back home when, from where I was sitting in the inn, I heard the piercing screams of a woman. I went out and a crowd had gathered around her. She was on the ground tearing out her hair, and pointing to the remains of a broken pitcher, saying: ‘I’m ruined. I shan’t have a sou for the next month, and who will feed my poor children then? That steward whose heart is harder than stone won’t let me off even a sou. How unlucky I am! I’m ruined! Ruined!’ Everyone felt sorry for her, and all I could hear around her were cries of ‘Poor woman,’ but nobody put their hands in their pockets. I went up to her suddenly and asked: ‘My good woman, what has happened to you?’ ‘What’s happened to me! Can’t you see? I was sent to buy a pitcher of oil. I stumbled and fell. The pitcher broke and there is the oil that was in it.’ At this moment the woman’s little children arrived. They were practically naked and the bad clothing of their mother showed the full extent of the poverty of this family. The children and their mother all started to cry. As I am standing here now, Master, it needs ten times less than that to move me. I was deeply moved with compassion and tears came to my eyes. I asked her in a broken voice how much the oil in the pitcher was worth. ‘How much?’ she answered, lifting her hands up to heaven. ‘Nine francs’ worth! More than I could earn in a month!’ I untied my purse straight away and tossed her two six-franc pieces, saying: ‘Here you are, my good woman. There are twelve…’ and without waiting for thanks I started on my way back to the village."

"Jacques avait raison. Comme la chose qu’ils voyaient venait à eux et qu’ils allaient à elle, ces deux marches en sens contraire abrégèrent la distance ; et bientôt ils aperçurent un char drapé de noir, traîné par quatre chevaux noirs, couverts de housses noires qui leur enveloppaient la tête et qui descendaient jusqu’à leurs pieds ; derrière, deux domestiques en noir ; à la suite deux autres vêtus de noir, chacun sur un cheval noir, caparaçonné de noir ; sur le siège du char un cocher noir, le chapeau rabattu et entouré d’un long crêpe qui pendait le long de son épaule gauche ; ce cocher avait la tête penchée, laissait flotter ses guides et conduisait moins ses chevaux qu’ils ne le conduisaient. Voilà nos deux voyageurs arrivés au côté de cette voiture funèbre. À l’instant, Jacques pousse un cri, tombe de son cheval plutôt qu’il n’en descend, s’arrache les cheveux, se roule à terre en criant : « Mon capitaine ! mon pauvre capitaine ! c’est lui, je n’en saurais douter, voilà ses armes… » Il y avait, en effet, dans le char, un long cercueil sous un drap mortuaire, sur le drap mortuaire une épée avec un cordon, et à côté du cercueil un prêtre, son bréviaire à la main et psalmodiant. Le char allait toujours, Jacques le suivait en se lamentant, le maître suivait Jacques en jurant et les domestiques certifiaient à Jacques que ce convoi était celui de son capitaine, décédé dans la ville voisine, d’où on le transportait à la sépulture de ses ancêtres. Depuis que ce militaire avait été privé par la mort d’un autre militaire, son ami, capitaine au même régiment, de la satisfaction de se battre au moins une fois par semaine, il en était tombé dans une mélancolie qui l’avait éteint au bout de quelques mois. Jacques, après avoir payé à son capitaine le tribut d’éloges, de regrets et de larmes qu’il lui devait, fit excuse à son maître, remonta sur son cheval, et ils allaient en silence. – Mais, pour Dieu, lecteur, me dites-vous, où allaient-ils ?… Mais, pour Dieu, lecteur, vous répondrai-je, est-ce qu’on sait où l’on va ? Et vous, où allez-vous ? Faut-il que je vous rappelle l’aventure d’Ésope ? Son maître Xantippe lui dit un soir d’été ou d’hiver, car les Grecs se baignaient dans toutes les saisons : « Ésope, va au bain ; s’il y a peu de monde nous nous baignerons… » Ésope part. Chemin faisant il rencontre la patrouille d’Athènes. « Où vas-tu ? – Où je vais ? répond Ésope, je n’en sais rien. – Tu n’en sais rien ? marche en prison. – Eh bien ! reprit Ésope, ne l’avais-je pas bien dit que je ne savais où j’allais ? je voulais aller au bain, et voilà que je vais en prison… » Jacques suivait son maître comme vous le vôtre ; son maître suivait le sien comme Jacques le suivait. – Mais, qui était le maître du maître de Jacques ? – Bon, est-ce qu’on manque de maître dans ce monde ? Le maître de Jacques en avait cent pour un, comme vous. Mais parmi tant de maîtres du maître de Jacques, il fallait qu’il n’y eût pas un bon ; car d’un jour à l’autre il en changeait. – Il était homme. – Homme passionné comme vous, lecteur ; homme curieux comme vous, lecteur ; homme questionneur comme vous, lecteur ; homme importun comme vous, lecteur. – Et pourquoi questionnait-il ? – Belle question ! Il questionnait pour apprendre et pour redire comme vous, lecteur…","Jack was right. As the thing they saw came to them and they went to it, these two steps in opposite directions shortened the distance; and soon they perceived a chariot draped in black, drawn by four black horses, covered with black covers which enveloped their heads and descended to their feet; behind, two servants in black; following two others dressed in black, each on a black horse, caparisoned in black; on the seat of the chariot a black coachman, his hat pulled down and surrounded by a long crape which hung along his left shoulder; this coachman had his head bowed, let his reins float, and drove his horses less than they drove him. Here are our two travelers arrived at the side of this funeral car. Instantly, Jacques uttered a cry, fell from his horse rather than dismounting, tore his hair, rolled on the ground, crying: “My captain! my poor captain! it's him, I can't doubt it, here are his weapons…” There was, in fact, in the chariot, a long coffin under a pall, on the pall a sword with a cord, and next to the coffin a priest, his breviary in his hand and chanting. The chariot was still going, Jacques followed it lamenting, the master followed Jacques swearing and the servants assured Jacques that this convoy was that of his captain, who had died in the neighboring town, from where he was being transported to the burial of his ancestors. Since this soldier had been deprived by the death of another soldier, his friend, captain in the same regiment, of the satisfaction of fighting at least once a week, he had fallen into a melancholy which had extinguished him in the after a few months. Jacques, after having paid his captain the tribute of praises, regrets and tears which he owed him, excused his master, remounted his horse, and they rode in silence. – But, for God, reader, you tell me, where were they going?… But, for God, reader, I will answer you, do we know where we are going? And you, where are you going? Need I remind you of Aesop's adventure? His master Xantippe said to him one summer or winter evening, for the Greeks bathed in all seasons: “Aesop, go to the bath; if there are few people we will bathe…” Aesop leaves. Along the way he meets the Athens patrol. "" Where are you going ? - Or I'll ? Aesop replies, I don't know. - Don't you know? walk to jail. - Well ! resumed Aesop, did I not say that I did not know where I was going? I wanted to go to the bath, and now I'm going to prison…” Jacques followed his master as you follow yours; his master followed his as Jacques followed him. ""But who was Jacques' master's master?"" – Well, do we lack a master in this world? Jacques' master had a hundred to one, like you. But among so many masters of Jacques' master, there must not have been a good one; because from one day to another it changed. - He was a man. – Passionate man like you, reader; curious man like you, reader; questioning man like you, reader; importunate man like you, reader. ""And why was he asking?"" - Nice question! He questioned to learn and to repeat like you, reader...","Jacques was right. Since whatever it was they could see was coming towards them and they were going towards it, the fact that both were advancing towards each other from opposite directions abridged the distance between them. Soon they saw a coach draped in black drawn by four black horses swathed in black cloths which covered their heads and reached down to their hooves. Behind them walked two servants in black and the rear was brought up by two others, also dressed in black, each riding a black horse caparisoned in black. In the driving seat was a black-clad driver, with a hat pulled well down and, wrapped round it, a long crepe that hung over his left shoulder. The driver's head was hunched forward, he held the reins slackly so that he seemed less to be leading his horses than being led by them. Our two travellers have now drawn level with the hearse. Immediately Jacques gives a shriek, falls rather than dismounts from his horse, tears his hair, and rolls on the ground, shouting: 'It's my Captain! my poor Captain! it's him! there's no mistake! that's his coat of arms on the door!' For inside the hearse there was a long coffin, and over it was draped funeral cloth, and on the funeral cloth lay a sword and a sash, and at the side of the coffin walked a priest, intoning from a prayer-book which he held in his hand. The hearse continued on its way. Jacques followed it weeping and wailing, the Master followed Jacques cursing, and the servants confirmed to Jacques that this was indeed the funeral cortege of his Captain who had died in the neighbouring town, whence his remains were being conveyed to the resting-place of his ancestors. The Captain, since being deprived by the death of another soldier, a friend of his who was also a captain in the same regiment, of the satisfaction of fighting a duel with him at least once a week, had gone into a melancholy decline which had killed him in a matter of months. Jacques paid his Captain his due tribute of praise, regrets, and tears. Then he apologized to his Master, got back on his horse, and they went on their way in silence. But for God's sake, Mr Storyteller, you ask, where were they going? And I answer: for God's sake, Reader, does any of us know where we're going? Where are you going? Do I have to remind you what happened to Aesop? His master, Xanthippus,* said to him one evening in summer, or maybe winter, for Greeks bathed all year round: 'Aesop, go down to the baths and if there aren't too many people there, we shall bathe.' Off Aesop trots. On the way, he is stopped by the Athenian street patrol. 'Where do you think you're going?' 'Where am I going?' replies Aesop, 'I really have no idea.' 'You don't know? Then it's jail for you.' 'There!' said Aesop. ' I was right when I said I didn't know where I was going. I wanted to go to the baths and here I am on my way to jail.' Jacques followed his master as you follow yours. His Master followed his master just as Jacques was following him. But who was Jacques's Master's master? Come, come. Is any of us short of a master in this world? Jacques's Master had a hundred masters if he had one, just as you do. But among the many masters of Jacques's Master, there couldn't have been a single master who was any good, since he kept changing them every day. That's because he was human. Human and passionate, like you, Reader. Human and curious, like you, Reader. Human and always asking questions, like you, Reader. Human and a damned nuisance, just like you, Reader. And why did he ask questions? Good question! He asked questions to learn and to quibble, like you, Reader.","Jacques was right. Since the thing they could see was coming towards them and they were going towards it, this convergence quickly shortened the distance between them and before long they could see a carriage draped in black, drawn by four black horses, in black drapes which covered their heads and hung down to their hooves. Behind them were two servants dressed in black and after them were two more servants dressed in black riding two black horses which were caparisoned in black. On the driving-seat of the carriage sat a coachman in black wearing a floppy brimmed hat with a long black ribbon which hung down his left shoulder. This coachman had his head bent forward and was letting the reins hang loose so that the horses appeared to be driving him rather than him driving them. Before long our two travellers found themselves alongside the funeral carriage. At that moment Jacques cried out and fell rather than got off his horse, tore out his hair and started rolling around on the ground, shouting: ‘My Captain! My poor Captain! It is him, there’s no mistaking it. Those are his arms…’ In the carriage there was, indeed, a long coffin under a funeral shroud. On top of this shroud was a sword with a cordon. Next to the coffin sat a priest intoning the office from an open breviary in his hand. Jacques followed behind, still lamenting. His master followed Jacques, swearing, and the servants assured Jacques that the cortège was that of his Captain, who had died in a neighbouring town whence he was being transported to the tomb of his ancestors. Ever since he had, by the death of his friend, a captain in the same regiment, been deprived of the satisfaction of fighting at least once a week, he had fallen into a profound melancholy which, after a few months, had eventually killed him. Jacques, having paid his Captain the tribute of praise, regret and tears which he owed him, begged his master’s forgiveness, got back on his horse and then they carried on their way in silence. But you are asking me, Reader, where in God’s name were they going? And I reply, Reader, in God’s name, does anybody ever really know where they are going? What about you? Where are you going? Do I have to remind you of the story of Aesop? His master, Xanthippus,15 said to him one summer’s evening, or it may have been a winter’s evening for that matter because the Greeks used to have baths whatever the season: ‘Aesop, go to the baths. If there are not too many people there we’ll take a bath.’ Aesop set off. On the way he met the town guard of Athens. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Where am I going?’ replied Aesop. ‘I don’t know.’ ‘You don’t know? Then you’re coming with us to prison.’ ‘There you are,’ said Aesop, ‘Didn’t I tell you I didn’t know where I was going? I wanted to go to the baths, and here I am going to prison.’ Jacques followed his master like you follow yours. His master followed his as Jacques followed him. – But who was the master of Jacques’ master? All right. Is anyone ever short of a master in this world? Jacques’ master, like you, had a hundred masters if he had one. But among all the many masters of Jacques’ master, it seems that there wasn’t one satisfactory one since from one day to the next he used to change master. – He was a man. A passionate man like you, Reader. A curious man like you, Reader. A questioning man like you, Reader. A nuisance like you, Reader. – And why did he ask questions? What a question! He asked questions so that he could learn and quibble like you, Reader."

"J’eus donc un parrain et une marraine. Maître Bigre, le plus fameux charron du village, avait un fils. Bigre le père fut mon parrain, et Bigre le fils était mon ami. À l’âge de dix-huit à dix-neuf ans nous nous amourachâmes tous les deux à la fois d’une petite couturière appelée Justine. Elle ne passait pas pour autrement cruelle ; mais elle jugea à propos de se signaler par un premier dédain, et son choix tomba sur moi.","So I had a godfather and a godmother. Master Bigre, the most famous wheelwright in the village, had a son. Bigre the father was my godfather, and Bigre the son was my friend.

She was not considered otherwise cruel; but she thought fit to signalize herself by a first disdain, and her choice fell on me.","And I had a godfather and a godmother.

Master Bugger – the most famous cartwright in our village – had a son. Bugger the Father was my godfather and Bugger the Son was my friend.

"Une autre fois, c’était le matin, Denise était venue panser Jacques. Tout dormait encore dans le château, Denise s’approcha en tremblant. Arrivée à la porte de Jacques, elle s’arrêta, incertaine si elle entrerait ou non. Elle entra en tremblant ; elle demeura assez longtemps à côté du lit de Jacques sans oser ouvrir les rideaux. Elle les entrouvrit doucement ; elle dit bonjour à Jacques en tremblant ; elle s’informa de sa nuit et de sa santé en tremblant ; Jacques lui dit qu’il n’avait pas fermé l’œil, qu’il avait souffert, et qu’il souffrait encore d’une démangeaison cruelle à son genou. Denise s’offrit à le soulager ; elle prit une petite pièce de flanelle ; Jacques mit sa jambe hors du lit, et Denise se mit à frotter avec sa flanelle au dessous de la blessure, d’abord avec un doigt, puis avec deux, avec trois, avec quatre, avec toute la main. Jacques la regardait faire, et s’enivrait d’amour. Puis Denise se mit à frotter avec sa flanelle sur la blessure même, dont la cicatrice était encore rouge, d’abord avec un doigt, ensuite avec deux, avec trois, avec quatre, avec toute la main. Mais ce n’était pas assez d’avoir éteint la démangeaison au-dessous du genou, sur le genou, il fallait encore l’éteindre au-dessus, où elle ne se faisait sentir que plus vivement. Denise posa sa flanelle au dessus du genou, et se mit à frotter là assez fermement d’abord avec un doigt, avec deux, avec trois, avec quatre, avec toute la main. La passion de Jacques, qui n’avait cessé de la regarder, s’accrut à un tel point, que, n’y pouvant plus résister, il se précipita sur la main de Denise… et la baisa.","Another time, it was in the morning, Denise had come to bandage Jacques. Everything was still asleep in the chateau. Denise approached, trembling. Arrived at Jacques's door, she stopped, uncertain whether she would enter or not. She entered trembling; she stayed long enough beside Jacques' bed without daring to open the curtains. She opened them gently; she says hello to Jacques, trembling; she inquired about her night and her health, trembling; Jacques told him that he had not closed his eye, that he had suffered, and that he still suffered from a cruel itch in his knee. Denise offered to relieve him; she took a small piece of flannel; Jacques put his leg out of bed, and Denise began to rub with her flannel under the wound, first with one finger, then with two, with three, with four, with the whole hand. Jacques watched her do it, and was intoxicated with love. Then Denise began to rub with her flannel on the very wound, the scar of which was still red, first with one finger, then with two, with three, with four, with the whole hand. But it was not enough to have extinguished the itch below the knee, on the knee, it was still necessary to extinguish it above, where it only made itself felt more acutely. Denise put her flannel above the knee, and began to rub there rather firmly, first with one finger, then with two, with three, with four, with the whole hand. The passion of Jacques, who had never ceased to look at her, increased to such a point that, unable to resist it any longer, he rushed to Denise's hand... and kissed it.","On another occasion—it was early one morning—Denise had come to dress Jacques's wound. Everyone else in the chateau was asleep. Denise trembled as she went to his room. When she reached the door, she stopped, unsure whether to go in or not. She entered, still trembling, and stood for some time at the side of Jacques's bed without drawing the bed-curtains. Then she opened them quietly, said good-morning to Jacques, still trembling, then trembled some more as she asked what sort of night he'd spent and how he felt. Jacques replied that he'd not slept a wink and that he was still suffering torments from his knee which was itching like blazes. Denise offered to make the itch go away. She took a small square of flannel, Jacques put his leg out of the bed, and Denise began rubbing away with her flannel just below the wound, first with one finger, then with two, then three, then four, and finally with her whole hand. Jacques watched her at work and love coursed hotly in his veins. Next, Denise, still with her flannel, began rubbing the wound itself where the scar still showed red, first with one finger, then with two, then three, then four, and finally with her whole hand. But curing the itch below the knee and on the knee was not enough. It had also to be stopped above the knee where it made its presence felt most strongly. Denise then applied her flannel above the wound, rubbing away very firmly, first with one finger, then with two, then three, then four, and finally with her whole hand. The emotion felt by Jacques, who had not taken his eyes off her for one moment, now expanded to such a pitch that, being incapable of holding out for a moment longer, he grabbed Denise's hand... and put it...","Another time it was morning and Denise had come to bandage Jacques. Everyone was still asleep in the château. Denise came near to Jacques, trembling. When she reached Jacques’ door she stopped, uncertain whether to go in or not. She entered, trembling, and stayed for quite a long time beside Jacques’ bed without daring to open the curtains. Still trembling, she opened them quietly, and said good morning to Jacques. She asked about the night he had spent and his health and she was still trembling. Jacques told her that he hadn’t slept a wink and that he had suffered and he was still suffering from a terrible itching on his knee. Denise offered to comfort him and took a little piece of flannel. Jacques put his leg out of the bed and Denise started to rub below the wound with her flannel, first with one finger, then two, then three, then four, then her whole hand. Jacques watched her do this, drunk with love. Then Denise started to rub her flannel on the wound itself, the scar of which was still red, first with one finger, then two, then three, then four, then her whole hand. But it wasn’t enough to have cured the itching under the knee and on the knee. It still needed to be cured above the knee where he could feel it all the more sharply. Denise put her flannel above his knee and started rubbing there quite firmly, first with one finger, then two, then three, then four, then her whole hand. Jacques had not stopped looking at her and his passion reached such a point that, no longer being able to resist, he threw himself on Denise’s hand… and then kissed her… hand."

"Cependant sa femme faisait des efforts inutiles ; le paysan, qui avait de l’âme, ne voulait rien accepter et se faisait tenir à quatre. L’hôte, les larmes aux yeux, s’adressait à Jacques et à son maître, et leur disait : « Messieurs, tâchez de le fléchir… » Jacques et son maître se mêlèrent de la partie ; tous à la fois conjuraient le paysan. Si j’ai jamais vu… – Si vous avez jamais vu ! Mais vous n’y étiez pas. Dites si l’on a jamais vu ! – Eh bien ! soit. Si l’on a jamais vu un homme confondu d’un refus transporté qu’on voulût bien accepter son argent, c’était cet hôte, il embrassait sa femme, il embrassait son compère, il embrassait Jacques et son maître, il criait : « Qu’on aille bien vite chasser de chez lui ces exécrables huissiers.","However, his wife was making useless efforts; the peasant, who had soul, did not want to accept anything and was held by four. The host, with tears in his eyes, addressed himself to Jacques and his master, and said to them: ""Gentlemen, try to bend him..."" Jacques and his master joined in the game; all at the same time conjured the peasant. If I've ever seen... - If you've ever seen! But you weren't there. Say if we have ever seen! - Well ! is. If you have ever seen a man confounded by a transported refusal to accept his money, it was this host, he kissed his wife, he kissed his friend, he kissed Jacques and his master, he cried: “Let us quickly drive these execrable ushers out of his house.","Meanwhile, his wife was getting nowhere. The peasant, who had spirit, wouldn't accept anything, and it took all four of them to keep him there. The landlord, with tears in his eyes, turned to Jacques and his Master and said: 'Gentlemen, try and talk him out of it!' Jacques and his Master joined in. They all spoke at the same time, appealing to the peasant. If I ever saw... If you ever saw? But you weren't there. Say 'If ever a man was seen'. Oh very well. If ever a man was seen so flattened by a refusal, and then so overjoyed that someone would take his money, it was that landlord. He hugged his wife, he hugged Jacques and his Master, and cried: 'Send somebody round to boot those blasted bailiffs out of his house!'","However, his wife’s efforts were useless. The peasant had integrity and didn’t want to take anything, and it took four people to stop him from leaving. The innkeeper, tears in his eyes, turned towards Jacques and his master and said: ‘Messieurs, try to make him change his mind.’ Jacques and his master intervened and everybody was beseeching the peasant at the same time. If ever I saw… – If ever you saw? But you weren’t there. You mean if ever anyone saw… Oh well, all right. If ever anybody saw a man become put out by a refusal and then become enraptured that somebody would take his money, it was this innkeeper. He kissed his wife, kissed Jacques and his master, and shouted: ‘Come on, quickly, let’s get those damned bailiffs out of his house.’"

This is something which would be a far commoner trait in people if, first, education and, secondly, extended contact with polite society did not knock off their rough edges, as happens with coins which, passing from hand to hand, are rubbed smooth and lose their definition.

Pascal, avocat général de Toulouse, qui me donna au comte de Tourville, qui aima mieux laisser croître sa barbe sous un habit de capucin que d’exposer sa vie ; c’est le comte de Tourville qui me donna à la marquise du Belloy, qui s’est sauvée à Londres avec un étranger ; c’est la marquise du Belloy qui me donna à un de ses cousins, qui s’est ruiné avec les femmes et qui a passé aux îles ; c’est ce cousin-là qui me recommanda à un M. Hérissant, usurier de profession, qui faisait valoir l’argent de M. de Rusai, docteur de Sorbonne, qui me fit entrer chez Mlle Isselin, que vous entreteniez, et qui me plaça chez vous, à qui je devrai un morceau de pain sur mes vieux jours, car vous me l’avez promis si je vous restais attaché : et il n’y a pas d’apparence que nous nous séparions. Jacques a été fait pour vous, et vous fûtes fait pour Jacques.","No sir ; but if the wishes I have made for its prosperity have not been fulfilled, it is not for lack of having been sincere. It was he who gave me to the Commander of La Boulaye, who perished while passing through Malta; it was the commander of La Boulaye who gave me to his elder brother the captain, who may now be dead of fistula; it was this captain who gave me to his youngest brother, the Advocate General of Toulouse, who went mad, and whom the family had locked up. It was M. Pascal, Advocate General of Toulouse, who gave me to the Comte de Tourville, who preferred to let his beard grow under a Capuchin coat than to risk his life; it was the Comte de Tourville who gave me to the Marquise du Belloy, who fled to London with a stranger; it was the Marquise du Belloy who gave me to one of her cousins, who ruined himself with women and went to the islands; it was that cousin who recommended me to a M. Hérissant, a usurer by profession, who used the money of M. de Rusai, doctor of the Sorbonne, who introduced me to Mlle Isselin, whom you kept, and who placed me with you, to whom I will owe a piece of bread on my old age, for you promised it to me if I remained attached to you: and it is not likely that we will separate. Jacques was made for you, and you were made for Jacques.","No I don't sir, but if all the good wishes I offered up for his prosperity went unanswered, it wasn't because they weren't sincere. He it was who got me taken on by Monsieur de la Boulaye, the Knight Commander, who died on his way to Malta. It was Monsieur de la Boulaye who passed me on to his oldest brother, the Captain of the same name, who may as we speak be dead of the fistula. It was the Captain who passed me on to his youngest brother, the Advocate-General of Toulouse, who went mad and was locked up by his family. It was the Advocate-General of Toulouse, Monsieur Pascal, who passed me on to the Count de Tourville, who preferred letting his beard grow under the cowl of a Capuchin monk to risking his neck under a soldier's helmet. It was the Count de Tourville who passed me on to the Marquise de Belloy, who ran away to London with some foreigner or other. It was the Marquise de Belloy who passed me on to a cousin of hers who ruined himself with women and then shipped himself off to the Indies. It was this same cousin who passed me on to a usurer named Herissant who made loans with money belonging to Monsieur de Rusai, a Sorbonne theologian, who passed me on to Mademoiselle Isselin, a lady of the town then in your keeping, and she passed me on to you, and it's you I'll have to thank for having a crust to eat when I'm old, for you promised to see me all right if I stayed with you, and it doesn't look as if we'll ever go our separate ways. Jacques was made for you and you were made for Jacques. *","No, Monsieur, but if the wishes which I made for his prosperity have not been fulfilled it is not for want of their being sincere. It was he who gave me to Commander La Boulaye who died on his way to Malta. And it was Commander La Boulaye who gave me to his elder brother, the Captain, who is now probably dead from the fistula, and it is this Captain who gave me to his youngest brother, the Advocate-General of Toulouse who went mad and was shut up by the family.

"Voilà ces deux hommes partis du noviciat, installés dans la maison d’Hudson et procédant sourdement aux informations. Ils eurent bientôt recueilli une liste de plus de forfaits qu’il n’en fallait pour mettre cinquante moines dans l’in pace. Leur séjour avait été long, mais leur menée si adroite qu’il n’en était rien transpiré. Hudson, tout fin qu’il était, touchait au moment de sa perte, qu’il n’en avait pas le moindre soupçon. Cependant le peu d’attention de ces nouveaux venus à lui faire la cour, le secret de leur voyage, leurs fréquentes conférences avec les autres religieux, leurs sorties tantôt ensemble, tantôt séparés ; l’espèce de gens qu’ils visitaient et dont ils étaient visités, lui causèrent quelque inquiétude. Il les épia, il les fit épier ; et bientôt l’objet de leur mission fut évident pour lui. Il ne se déconcerta point ; il s’occupa profondément de la manière, non d’échapper à l’orage qui le menaçait, mais de l’attirer sur la tête des deux commissaires : et voici le parti très extraordinaire auquel il s’arrêta :","Here are these two men leaving the novitiate, installed in the house of Hudson and secretly proceeding to the information. They soon had collected a list of more forfeits than enough to put fifty monks in space. Their stay had been long, but their conduct so skilful that nothing had transpired. Hudson, shrewd as he was, touched at the moment of his loss that he had not the slightest suspicion of it. However, the lack of attention of these newcomers to pay court to him, the secrecy of their journey, their frequent conferences with other religious, their going out sometimes together, sometimes separately; the kind of people they visited and by whom they were visited caused him some uneasiness. He spied on them, he made them spy; and soon the object of their mission was evident to him. He was not disconcerted; he was deeply concerned with the manner, not of escaping the storm which threatened him, but of drawing it over the heads of the two commissioners: and here is the very extraordinary game at which he stopped:","The two men left the quarters where they were lodged as novices, moved to Hudson's abbey, and began to make discreet enquiries. Soon they had a list of more misdeeds than would have been needed to put fifty monks behind bars. They had stayed for a long time, but their manner of proceeding had been so discreet that no hint of what they were doing leaked out. Clever though he was, Hudson was teetering on the brink of ruin and was blissfully unaware of the danger. Even so, the fact that the newcomers had been in no hurry to pay him their court, that they had not disclosed the reason for their journey, that they had frequent discussions with the other monks, that they frequently went out, together or separately, this, when added to the sort of people they visited and by whom they were visited, all made him uneasy. He watched them, had them watched by others, and soon the purpose of their coming became all too clear. He was not alarmed but made his first priority to find a way, not of escaping the gathering storm which threatened to engulf him, but of redirecting it on to the heads of the two commissioners. This is the very extraordinary plan he decided to implement.","The two men left the novice house and were installed in Hudson’s Abbey, where they secretly set about obtaining information. Before long they had gathered a list of more crimes than it needed to send fifty monks to the in pace.49 Their stay had been a long one but their conduct had been so skilful that nothing had leaked out. Hudson, sly as he was, was nearing the moment of his undoing without the least suspicion. However, the newcomers’ failure to pay court to him, the secrecy of their journey, their frequent discussions with the other monks and their journeys out, sometimes together, sometimes alone, the kind of people they visited and who visited them all caused him some anxiety. He watched them and had them spied on and before long the object of their mission became clear to him. He did not lose his self-assurance but busied himself in finding a way not of escaping the storm which was threatening him but of bringing it down on the heads of the two commissioners, and this is the extraordinary way he went about it."

"Vous allez prendre l’histoire du capitaine de Jacques pour un conte, et vous aurez tort. Je vous proteste que telle qu’il l’a racontée à son maître, tel fut le récit que j’en avais entendu faire aux Invalides, je ne sais en quelle année, le jour de Saint-Louis, à table chez un M. de Saint-Étienne, major de l’hôtel ; et l’historien qui parlait en présence de plusieurs autres officiers de la maison, qui avaient connaissance du fait, était un personnage grave qui n’avait point du tout l’air d’un badin. Je vous le répète donc pour ce moment et pour la suite : soyez circonspect si vous ne voulez pas prendre dans cet entretien de Jacques et de son maître le vrai pour le faux, le faux pour le vrai. Vous voilà bien averti, et je m’en lave les mains. – Voilà, me direz-vous, deux hommes bien extraordinaires ! – Et c’est là ce qui vous met en défiance. Premièrement, la nature est si variée, surtout dans les instincts et les caractères, qu’il n’y a rien de si bizarre dans l’imagination d’un poète dont l’expérience et l’observation ne vous offrissent le modèle dans la nature. Moi, qui vous parle, j’ai rencontré le pendant du Médecin malgré lui, que j’avais regardé jusque-là comme la plus folle et la plus gaie des fictions. – Quoi ! le pendant du mari à qui sa femme dit : J’ai trois enfants sur les bras ; et qui lui répond : Mets-les à terre… Ils me demandent du pain : donne-leur le fouet ! – Précisément. Voici son entretien avec ma femme.","You are going to take the story of Captain Jacques for a tale, and you will be wrong. I protest to you that as he told it to his master, such was the account I had heard of it at the Invalides, I do not know in what year, on Saint-Louis day, at table with a M. de Saint-Étienne, major of the hotel; and the historian who spoke in the presence of several other officers of the household, who had knowledge of the matter, was a grave personage who did not at all look like a joker. I therefore repeat it to you for this moment and for the future: be circumspect if you do not want to take in this interview between Jacques and his master the true for the false, the false for the true. You are well warned, and I wash my hands of it. “Here, you will tell me, are two very extraordinary men! “And that is what makes you suspicious. First, nature is so varied, especially in instincts and characters, that there is nothing so bizarre in the imagination of a poet whose experience and observation do not offer you the model in the nature. I, who speak to you, have met the counterpart of The Doctor in Spite of Himself, which until then I had regarded as the craziest and most cheerful of fictions. - What ! the counterpart of the husband to whom his wife says: I have three children on my hands; and who answers him: Put them on the ground… They ask me for bread: give them the whip! - Precisely. Here is his interview with my wife.","If you're thinking that the story of Jacques's Captain is made up, you're wrong. * I here declare that the tale Jacques has just spun for his Master was the story I heard at the Invalides in I forget which year, though it was on the feast of Saint Louis * and I was dining with a Monsieur de Saint-Etienne, who was then in charge. * The story was told, in the presence of several other resident officers who knew the facts, by a sober-sided man who did not give the least impression of being a wag. So I repeat, both on this occasion and for the future: be circumspect if you wish to avoid, in the conversations that take place between Jacques and his Master, accepting as true what is false and rejecting as false what is true. You can't say you haven't been warned, and I wash my hands of the matter. But, you'll say, they are such an unusual pair! Is that what's making you suspicious? Let me say in the first place that nature is so varied, especially in the area of human instinct and character, that there's no oddity dreamed up by the imagination of writers for which experience and observation cannot provide a real-life model. I myself have met the real-life counterpart of Le Medecin malgre lui, which I had previously regarded as the most extravagant and farcical of fabrications. You mean the counterpart of the man whose wife says to him: 'I've got three children on my hands' and he says ' So? Put them on the floor, then.' ' But they keep asking for bread.' ' So give them a taste of the whip'? * The very same. Here's how he spoke to my wife:","You are going to take the story of Jacques’ Captain as a mere fiction, but you will be wrong. I assure you that, such as he told the story to his master, so did I hear it at the Invalides, in I’m not sure what year, but on the feast of Saint-Louis. I was dining with Monsieur de Saint-Etienne the adjutant of the Invalides.19 The story-teller spoke in the presence of several other officers of the establishment who had knowledge of the facts and was a serious man who didn’t seem at all like a joker. This is a timely moment for me to give you a reminder for both the present and the future that you must be circumspect if you want to avoid taking the truth for lies and lies for the truth in Jacques’ conversation with his master. Now that I have warned you, I wash my hands of the matter. They really are quite an extraordinary pair of men, you are saying to me. Is that what makes you suspicious? Firstly, nature is so varied, especially when it comes to instinct and character, that there is nothing in a poet’s imagination, however bizarre, for which experience and observation might not find a model in nature. I, who speak to you now, I have met the real-life counterpart of the Médecin malgré lui whom I had thought until then to be the most mad and whimsical of inventions.20 – What! The real-life counterpart of the husband whose wife says to him: ‘I’ve three children on my hands’, and he tells her: ‘Put them on the ground.’ ‘They are asking me for bread.’ ‘Give them a beating.’ Exactly. This is an account of his conversation with my wife."

"Cependant les ennemis dont il était environné avaient, chacun de leur côté, envoyé au général de l’ordre des mémoires, où ce qu’ils savaient de la mauvaise conduite d’Hudson était exposé. La confrontation de ces mémoires en augmentait la force. Le général était janséniste, et par conséquent disposé à tirer vengeance de l’espèce de persécution qu’Hudson avait exercée contre les adhérents à ses opinions. Il aurait été enchanté d’étendre le reproche des mœurs corrompues d’un seul défenseur de la bulle et de la morale relâchée sur la secte entière. En conséquence il remit les différents mémoires des faits et gestes d’Hudson entre les mains de deux commissaires qu’il dépêcha secrètement avec ordre de procéder à leur vérification et de la constater juridiquement ; leur enjoignant surtout de mettre à la conduite de cette affaire la plus grande circonspection, le seul moyen d’accabler subitement le coupable et de le soustraire à la protection de la cour et du Mirepoix, aux yeux duquel le jansénisme était le plus grand de tous les crimes, et la soumission à la bulle Unigenitus, la première des vertus. Richard, mon secrétaire, fut un des deux commissaires.","However, the enemies with whom he was surrounded had, each on their side, sent memoirs to the general of the order, in which what they knew of Hudson's bad conduct was set forth. The confrontation of these memories increased their strength. The general was a Jansenist, and therefore disposed to avenge the species of persecution which Hudson had exercised against the adherents to his opinions. He would have been delighted to extend the reproach of the corrupt mores of a single defender of the bubble and the loose morals to the entire sect. Consequently, he handed over the various memoirs of Hudson's deeds and deeds into the hands of two commissioners whom he secretly dispatched with orders to proceed to their verification and to establish them legally; enjoining them above all to bring the greatest circumspection to the conduct of this affair, the only means of suddenly overwhelming the culprit and removing him from the protection of the court and of Mirepoix, in whose eyes Jansenism was the greatest of all crimes, and submission to the bull Unigenitus, the first of the virtues. Richard, my secretary, was one of the two commissioners.","But the enemies who surrounded him had all written separate accounts setting out what they knew of Hudson's wicked ways and had sent them to the Vicar-General of the Order. When these reports were compared, they seemed all the more compelling. The Vicar-General was a Jansenist and therefore inclined to look for revenge for the persecution Hudson had meted out to those who shared his beliefs. He would have been only too delighted to extend a charge of depravity brought against one defender of the Papal Bull Unigenitus* and laxism to cover the entire sect. He therefore handed all the accounts of Hudson's exploits to two commissioners whom he sent secretly with orders to investigate and obtain the evidence needed for formal charges to be made, instructing them to proceed in this matter with the greatest possible circumspection, for this was the only way of bringing the culprit to justice quickly and of removing him from the protection of the Court and Mirepoix,* for whom Jansenism was the most heinous crime of all and acceptance of Unigenitus the greatest of all the virtues. Richard, my secretary, was one of the two commissioners.","However, the enemies he was surrounded by had each individually sent to the General of the Order memoranda in which what they knew of Hudson’s misconduct was exposed. Comparison of these records only increased their strength. The General was a Jansenist and consequently inclined to seek vengeance for the kind of persecution which Hudson had led against adherents of his belief. He would have been only too pleased to extend the reproach against one defender of laxism and the papal bull Unigenitus to the whole sect. Consequently he entrusted the different records of the actions and deeds of Hudson to two commissioners whom he secretly sent away to the Abbey with orders to verify these and obtain legally admissible evidence. He instructed them above all to show the greatest circumspection in the way they went about the business since it was the sole means of bringing about the downfall of the guilty party and removing him from the protection of the court and Mirepoix, in whose eyes Jansenism was the greatest of all crimes, and submission to the bull Unigenitus was the greatest of all virtues.48 Richard, my secretary, was one of these two investigators."

Partant je pense que vous pouvez reprendre l’histoire de vos amours.","Well done, Jacques! So I did what I proposed. Tell me if it was possible to do better to console you. You were crying: if I had told you about the object of your pain, what would have happened? That you would have cried much more, and that I would have completed your sorrow. I deceived you, both by the ridiculousness of my funeral oration, and by the little quarrel which followed. Now agree that the thought of your captain is as far from you as the funeral chariot that carries him to his last home. Therefore, I think you can resume the story of your loves.","Excellent, Jacques. I have achieved what I set out to do. Tell me, was there a more effective way of consoling you? You were crying. Now, if I'd got you to talk about the person for whom you were grieving, what would have happened? You'd have blubbed a great deal more and I'd only have added to your misery. I sidetracked you twice: first, with my ludicrous funeral oration, and secondly, with the little argument that followed. Come now, admit that the thought of your Captain is now as far away as the hearse taking him to his final resting-place. Consequently, I think you could resume the story of your loves.","Well done, Jacques. Then I have done what I set out to do. Tell me if it was possible to find a better way of consoling you? You were crying, and if I had talked about the object of your sorrow, what would have happened? You would have cried even more and I would have only added to your grief. But I fooled you by the absurdity of my funeral speech and by the little quarrel which followed it. Admit that at this moment your thoughts about your Captain are as remote as the funeral cortège which is taking him to his last resting-place.

"En conséquence de cette calomnie ou médisance du portier, on se crut autorisé à faire mille diableries, mille méchancetés à ce pauvre Père Ange dont la tête parut se déranger. Alors on appela un médecin qu’on corrompit et qui attesta que ce religieux était fou et qu’il avait besoin de respirer l’air natal. S’il n’eût été question que d’éloigner ou d’enfermer le Père Ange, c’eût été une affaire bientôt faite ; mais parmi les dévotes dont il était la coqueluche, il y avait de grandes dames à ménager. On leur parlait de leur directeur avec une commisération hypocrite : « Hélas ! ce pauvre Père, c’est bien dommage ! c’était l’aigle de notre communauté. – Qu’est-ce qui lui est donc arrivé ? » À cette question on ne répondait qu’en poussant un profond soupir et en levant les yeux au ciel ; si l’on insistait, on baissait la tête et l’on se taisait. À cette singerie l’on ajoutait quelquefois : « Ô Dieu ! qu’est-ce de nous !… Il a encore des moments surprenants… des éclairs de génie… Cela reviendra peut-être, mais il y a peu d’espoir… Quelle perte pour la religion !… » Cependant les mauvais procédés redoublaient ; il n’y avait rien qu’on ne tentât pour amener le Père Ange au point où on le disait ; et on y aurait réussi si frère Jean ne l’eût pris en pitié. Que vous dirai-je de plus ? Un soir que nous étions tous endormis, nous entendîmes frapper à notre porte : nous nous levons ; nous ouvrons au Père Ange et à mon frère déguisés. Ils passèrent le jour suivant dans la maison ; le lendemain, dès l’aube du jour, ils décampèrent. Ils s’en allaient les mains bien garnies ; car Jean, en m’embrassant, me dit : « J’ai marié tes sœurs, si j’étais resté dans le couvent, deux ans de plus, ce que j’y étais, tu serais un des gros fermiers du canton ; mais tout a changé, et voilà ce que je puis faire pour toi. Adieu, Jacques, si nous avons du bonheur, le Père et moi, tu t’en ressentiras… » puis il me lâcha dans la main les cinq louis dont je vous ai parlé, avec cinq autres pour la dernière des filles du village, qu’il avait mariée et qui venait d’accoucher d’un gros garçon qui ressemblait à frère Jean comme deux gouttes d’eau.","As a result of this slander or slander from the porter, they thought they were authorized to do a thousand devils, a thousand mean things to this poor Father Angel whose head seemed to be out of order. So they called a corrupted doctor who attested that this monk was mad and that he needed to breathe native air. If it had only been a question of removing or imprisoning Father Ange, it would have been a matter soon done; but among the devotees of whom he was the darling, there were great ladies to spare. They were spoken to of their director with hypocritical commiseration: “Alas! what a shame, poor Father! it was the eagle of our community. ""So what happened to him?"" This question was only answered by heaving a deep sigh and raising our eyes to heaven; if they insisted, they lowered their heads and were silent. To this antics was sometimes added: “O God! what of us!... There are still surprising moments... flashes of genius... It may come back, but there is little hope... What a loss for religion!...” However, the bad behavior redoubled; there was nothing that was not attempted to bring Father Ange to the point where it was said; and we would have succeeded if Brother Jean had not taken pity on him. What more can I tell you? One evening when we were all asleep, we heard a knock at our door: we got up; we open to Father Ange and my brother in disguise. They spent the next day in the house; the next day, at dawn, they decamped. They went away with their hands full; for Jean, embracing me, said to me: “I married your sisters, if I had remained in the convent two more years, which I was there, you would have been one of the big farmers of the canton; but everything has changed, and this is what I can do for you. Farewell, Jacques, if we are happy, the Father and I, you will feel it…” then he dropped the five louis I told you about in my hand, with five more for the last of the village girls, whom I he had married and who had just given birth to a fat boy who looked like Brother Jean like two drops of water.","As a result of the libel or slander put about by the porter, all and sundry felt they were entitled to do all sorts of wicked, nasty things to poor Pere Ange, who started to break under the strain. At this point, they called in a doctor who they bribed. He certified that he was mad and said it would do him good to go away and fill his lungs with the air of his native heath. If it had been mooted that he be simply sent away or locked up, it could have been managed quite easily. But among the pious females who thought the sun shone out of him, there were several great ladies who needed to be handled carefully. They were told all about their confessor in tones of hypocritical concern. 'Alas! poor Pere Ange! He was the leading light of our community!' 'Why, what's happened to him?' This question met with a deep sigh and eyes raised to Heaven. If further questions were asked, they were answered by lowered eyes and silence. To this playacting was sometimes added: 'O God! Woe are we!... He still has lucid moments... flashes of genius... He may get over it, but there's not much hope... What a loss to the faith!' Meanwhile, the harsh treatment got worse. They tried everything to bring Pere Ange to the state it was claimed he was in, and it would have worked too if Frere Jean hadn't felt sorry for him. What else can I say? One night, we were all fast asleep. We hear a knock at the door. We get up and in walk Pere Ange and my brother, both in disguise. They spent the following day in our house and the next, at first light, they decamped. They went with their pockets well lined, for as he embraced me Jean said: 'I've married off all your sisters. If I'd stayed in the monastery for another couple of years, the way I was going, you'd have ended up one of the biggest farmers round about. But that's all finished now , I've done all I could for you. Goodbye, Jacques. If things turn out well for Pere Ange and me, you'll know it.' Then he slipped into my hand the five louis I told you about, plus another five for the latest village girl he had found a husband for. She'd just had a chubby boy who resembled Frere Jean to a T","As a result of this calumny or slander on the part of the porter, they thought themselves justified in doing a thousand wrongs and injuries to poor Friar Angel, who seemed to lose his wits. Then they called in a doctor whom they bribed and who certified that the priest was mad and needed to return to his home for a rest. If it had been simply a question of sending Friar Angel away or shutting him up the matter would have been quickly dealt with, but he was the darling of the female church-goers amongst whom there were a number of important ladies who had to be handled carefully. The ladies heard their spiritual director spoken of with hypocritical commiseration: ‘Alas! The poor father… It’s a terrible shame… He was the leading light of our community.’ ‘What’s happened to him, then?’ The answer to this question was a deep sigh, accompanied by an upward movement of the eyes towards heaven. Further questions were met by a downward movement of the head and total silence. Occasionally they would add to this mummery: ‘ Oh God! This mortal coil… He still has his surprising moments… flashes of genius… It will come back to him perhaps… But there’s little hope… What a loss for the Faith.’ Meanwhile they stepped up their nastiness. They tried everything to bring Friar Angel to the state they said he’d reached. And they would have succeeded had Friar Jean not taken pity on him. What more can I tell you? One evening when we were all asleep we heard a knocking at the door. We got up and opened to Friar Angel and my brother who were in disguise. They stayed in our house all the next day and at dawn the day after that they went off. They went away with their hands full of provisions and as he embraced me Jean’s parting words were: ‘I married off your sisters and if I had stayed in the monastery for two years longer, with the position I used to have, you would have been one of the richest farmers of the district, but everything’s changed and that’s all I can do for you. Farewell, Jacques, if ever we meet good fortune, Friar Angel and I, you will know about it…’ Then he left in my hand the five louis I’ve told you about, with five more for the last of the girls of the village, whom he had married off and who had just given birth to a bouncing baby boy who looked as much like my brother Jean as two peas in a pod."

Mme de La Pommeraye leur répondit sèchement : « Est-ce que vous imaginez que ce que je fais, je le fais pour vous ? Qui êtes-vous ? Que vous dois-je ? À quoi tient-il que je ne vous renvoie l’une et l’autre à votre tripot ? Si ce que l’on vous offre est trop pour vous, c’est trop peu pour moi.

"Jacques, son maître et les autres voyageurs qui s’étaient arrêtés au même gîte, crurent que le ciel s’éclaircirait sur le midi ; il n’en fut rien ; et la pluie de l’orage ayant gonflé le ruisseau qui séparait le faubourg de la ville, au point qu’il eût été dangereux de le passer, tous ceux dont la route conduisait de ce côté prirent le parti de perdre une journée, et d’attendre. Les uns se mirent à causer ; d’autres à aller et venir, à mettre le nez à la porte, à regarder le ciel et à rentrer en jurant et frappant du pied ; plusieurs à politiquer et à boire ; beaucoup à jouer, le reste à fumer, à dormir et à ne rien faire.

Some began to talk; others to come and go, to put their noses in the door, to look at the sky and to return swearing and stamping their feet; many to politics and drinking; a lot to play, the rest to smoke, sleep and do nothing.

But it didn't, and the rain from the downpour had so swollen the stream separating the old town from the new town that had grown up outside the walls that it would have been dangerous to try to cross it. So those whose road lay in that direction decided to write off that day and wait. Some began to chat, others moved about, poking their noses out of doors, watching the sky, then coming back in again swearing and stamping their feet. Others argued about politics and drank, many played cards, and the rest smoked, dozed, or did nothing. The Master said to Jacques: 'I hope Jacques will go on with the tale of his love-life and that Heaven, having decided to grant me the satisfaction of hearing how it ends, has sent this foul weather to keep us here for that very purpose.'","Jacques, his master and the other travellers who had stopped at the same resting-place thought that the sky would clear at noon. It did nothing of the sort, and since the rain from the storm had swelled the stream which separated the suburb from the town to such an extent that it would have been dangerous to cross it, everyone travelling in that direction decided to lose a day and wait. Some struck up conversations, others went back and forth, putting their noses outside to look at the sky and then coming back in swearing and stamping. Several set to drinking and talking about politics. Many gambled. The rest occupied themselves in smoking, sleeping and doing nothing. The master said to Jacques: ‘I hope that Jacques will carry on the story of his loves and that Heaven which wants me to have the satisfaction of hearing the end will detain us here with this bad weather.’"

"Ils sortaient de la ville lorsqu’ils rencontrèrent un homme grand et vigoureux, le chapeau bordé sur la tête, l’habit galonné sur toutes les tailles allant seul si vous en exceptez deux grands chiens qui le précédaient. Jacques ne l’eut pas plus tôt aperçu, que descendre de cheval, s’écrier : « C’est lui ! » et se jeter à son cou, fut l’affaire d’un instant. L’homme aux deux chiens paraissait très embarrassé des caresses de Jacques, le repoussait doucement, et lui disait : « Monsieur, vous me faites trop d’honneur.","They were going out of town when they met a tall, sturdy man with a brimmed hat on his head, laced coat on all sizes going alone if you except two large dogs who preceded him. Jacques had no sooner seen him than dismount his horse and exclaim: ""It's him!"" and throwing herself on his neck was the affair of a moment. The man with the two dogs seemed very embarrassed by Jacques' caresses, pushed him away gently, and said to him: ""Monsieur, you do me too much honor.""","They had just left the town limits when they overtook a tall, vigorous man, wearing a hat with a fringe and a coat braided at every seam, walking alone*—alone, that is, if you discount two large dogs which ran on ahead of him. No sooner did Jacques see him than the actions of jumping off his horse, shouting 'It's him!', and flinging both arms round the man's neck, were the work of a moment. The man with the two dogs seemed highly embarrassed by Jacques's effusions, disengaged himself gingerly, and said: 'Sir, you overwhelm me.'","They were just leaving the town when they met a tall well-built man wearing a braided hat and a suit with gold braiding on the seams. He was alone – unless you counted the two large hounds which preceded him. Jacques had no sooner set eyes on him than he was off his horse shouting, ‘It’s him!’ , and was all over the man before anyone knew what was happening. The man with the dogs appeared to be very embarrassed by Jacques’ caresses and pushed him away gently, and said: ‘Monsieur, you do me too much honour.’"

"« … Elle produisit l’une et l’autre. Il y avait des jours où ils étaient les meilleurs amis du monde, et d’autres où ils étaient ennemis mortels. Les jours d’amitié ils se cherchaient, ils se fêtaient, ils s’embrassaient, ils se communiquaient leurs peines, leurs plaisirs, leurs besoins ; ils se consultaient sur leurs affaires les plus secrètes, sur leurs intérêts domestiques, sur leurs espérances, sur leurs craintes, sur leurs projets d’avancement. Le lendemain, se rencontraient-ils ? ils passaient l’un à côté de l’autre sans se regarder, ou ils se regardaient fièrement, ils s’appelaient Monsieur, ils s’adressaient des mots durs, ils mettaient l’épée à la main et se battaient. S’il arrivait que l’un des deux fût blessé, l’autre se précipitait sur son camarade, pleurait, se désespérait, l’accompagnait chez lui et s’établissait à côté de son lit jusqu’à ce qu’il fût guéri. Huit jours, quinze jours, un mois après, c’était à recommencer, et l’on voyait, d’un instant à un autre, deux braves gens… deux braves gens, deux amis sincères, exposés à périr par la main l’un de l’autre, et le mort n’aurait certainement pas été le plus à plaindre des deux. On leur avait parlé plusieurs fois de la bizarrerie de leur conduite ; moi-même, à qui mon capitaine avait permis de parler, je lui disais : « Mais, monsieur, s’il vous arrivait de le tuer ? » À ces mots, il se mettait à pleurer et se couvrait les yeux de ses mains ; il courait dans son appartement comme un fou. Deux heures après, ou son camarade le ramenait chez lui blessé, ou il rendait le même service à son camarade. Ni mes remontrances… ni mes remontrances, ni celles des autres n’y faisaient rien ; on n’y trouva de remèdes qu’à les séparer. Le ministre de la Guerre fut instruit d’une persévérance si singulière dans des extrémités si opposées, et mon capitaine nommé à un commandement de place, avec injonction expresse de se rendre sur-le-champ à son poste, et défense de s’en éloigner ; une autre défense fixa son camarade au régiment… Je crois que ce maudit cheval me fera devenir fou… À peine les ordres du ministre furent-ils arrivés, que mon capitaine, sous prétexte d’aller remercier de la faveur qu’il venait d’obtenir, partit pour la cour, représenta qu’il était riche et que son camarade indigent avait le même droit aux grâces du roi ; que le poste qu’on venait de lui accorder récompenserait les services de son ami, suppléerait à son peu de fortune, et qu’il en serait, lui, comblé de joie. Comme le ministre n’avait eu d’autre intention que de séparer ces deux hommes bizarres, et que les procédés généreux touchent toujours, il fut arrêté… Maudite bête, tiendras-tu ta tête droite ?… Il fut arrêté que mon capitaine resterait au régiment et que son camarade irait occuper le commandement de place.","“…She produced both. There were days when they were best friends, and days when they were mortal enemies. On days of friendship they looked for each other, they celebrated, they kissed each other, they communicated their sorrows, their pleasures, their needs; they consulted each other on their most secret affairs, on their domestic interests, on their hopes, on their fears, on their plans for advancement. The next day, did they meet? they passed each other without looking at each other, or they looked at each other proudly, they called each other Monsieur, they addressed harsh words to each other, they put their swords in their hands and fought. If it happened that one of the two was injured, the other rushed to his comrade, wept, in despair, accompanied him home and settled beside his bed until he was cured. . Eight days, fifteen days, a month later, we had to start all over again, and one saw, from one moment to another, two brave people... two brave people, two sincere friends, exposed to perish by the hand of the one from the other, and the dead would certainly not have been the more to be pitied of the two. They had been told several times of the oddity of their conduct; I myself, to whom my captain had allowed to speak, I said to him: ""But, sir, if you happen to kill him? At these words he began to cry and covered his eyes with his hands; he was running around his apartment like a madman. Two hours later, either his comrade brought him home wounded, or he rendered the same service to his comrade. Neither my remonstrances... nor my remonstrances, nor those of others did anything; the only remedy found was to separate them. The Minister of War was informed of such singular perseverance in such opposite extremities, and my captain appointed to a place command, with an express injunction to go immediately to his post, and prohibition to do so. remove ; another tusk stared at his comrade at the regiment...I think that accursed horse will drive me mad...Scarcely had the Minister's orders arrived, than my captain, under the pretext of going to thank him for the favor he had just to obtain, left for the court, represented that he was rich and that his indigent comrade had the same right to the favors of the king; that the post which had just been granted to him would reward the services of his friend, would make up for his little fortune, and that he himself would be filled with joy. As the Minister had had no other intention than to separate these two bizarre men, and as generous procedures always touch, he was arrested… Cursed beast, will you hold your head erect?… It was decided that my captain would remain at the regiment and that his comrade would take the place command.","In the event, it gave rise to both. There were some days when they were the best of friends, and others when they were deadly enemies. On days when they were friends, they sought each other out, greeted each other with open arms, embraced, shared their troubles, their pleasures, their needs. They took each other's advice on their most private affairs, family matters, their hopes, fears, and plans for promotion. But when they met the next day, they would look each other haughtily in the eye, call each other Sir, make flinty remarks, reach for their swords, and fight. If one of them was wounded, the other would rush to his friend's side, shed hot tears, beat his breast despairingly, go with him to his quarters, and remain at his bedside until he was fully recovered. A week, two weeks, a month later, it would start all over again, and then you'd have the sight of two good men... yes two excellent men, two loyal friends, each liable to be killed by the other— and the one who died would not be the more to be pitied of the pair. They had been warned several times that their behaviour was bizarre. I myself, having my Captain's permission to speak freely, said more than once: 'But sir, what if you killed him?' At this, he would begin to sob, cover his eyes with both hands, and run around his room like a mad thing. Yet two hours later, either his friend would bring him back bleeding or he would do the same for his friend. But neither my remonstrations... neither my remonstrations nor the remonstrations of other people had the least effect. There was only one thing for it: they had to be kept apart. The War Minister was informed of their singular determination to persist in oscillating wildly between these two extreme and opposite poles. My Captain was made adjutant in a garrison elsewhere, told to take up his duties with immediate effect, and was expressly ordered never to leave his post. A separate order restricted his friend to company barracks... Damn, this blasted horse will drive me mad!... The orders had no sooner arrived from the Minister when my Captain, saying he merely wished to show his gratitude for the favour he'd been shown, galloped off to court, said that he was rich and that his friend, who was poor, was equally deserving of His Majesty's indulgence. He said the posting he had just been given would be a fitting reward for his friend's loyal service, that it would make good his want of fortune, and that he himself would be only too happy if this were done. Since the Minister had no intention other than to keep these two bizarre men apart, and because generous actions invariably strike a responsive chord, it was decided... Damn the beast! Keep your head straight, will you?... it was decided that my Captain would stay with the regiment and his friend would take up his command elsewhere.","In fact it produced both. There were days when they were the best of friends and others when they were mortal enemies. On their days of friendship they would seek each other out, make a great show of pleasure when they met, embrace each other and then tell each other all their problems, their pleasures and their needs. They would consult each other on the most intimate subjects, on their domestic affairs, their hopes, their fears, their ambitions. And then the next day they would pass each other by without looking, or they would glare fiercely at each other, call each other ‘Monsieur’, say harsh words to each other, draw their swords and fight. If it happened that one of the two was wounded, the other would rush up to his friend crying and lamenting, see him to his quarters and install himself at his friend’s bedside until he was better. Then, a week, or a fortnight, or a month later, it would begin again, and people would see from one moment to the next two gallant men… two gallant men, two sincere friends each facing death at the other’s hands and the one who died would certainly not have been the one deserving the most pity. People had often spoken to them about the strangeness of their conduct. I, myself– for my Captain allowed me to discuss things with him – used to ask him: ‘Monsieur, what if you killed him?’ At these words he would start to cry and bury his face in his hands. Then he would run round his apartment like a madman. Two hours later, either his friend would bring him back wounded or he would do the same for his friend. Neither my protests… neither my protests nor those of anyone else did any good. The only solution was to separate them. The Minister of War was informed of their extraordinary persistence in these extremes of behaviour and my Captain was given command of a fortress with strict orders to present himself there immediately and an absolute prohibition on leaving it. For his part, my Captain’s friend was forbidden from leaving the regiment… I think this damned horse will drive me insane… Hardly had the orders of the Minister arrived than my Captain, under the pretext of going to present his thanks for the favour bestowed on him, left for Court, where he pointed out that he himself was rich, but his comrade had the same right to the King’s graces, that the command which he had been given would reward his friend’s services and add to his small fortune – and this would for his part make him very happy. Since the Minister only had it in mind to separate these two strange men and since generous behaviour always has an effect on people, it was decided… Damned beast, can’t you keep your head straight… it was decided that my Captain would stay in the regiment and his friend would be transferred to take command of the fortress."

I won’t tell you any more, that’s for sure. I can see what you want, but there’s absolutely nothing doing. Since you were stupid enough to stay away without rhyme or reason I do not want you to compound it all by going back and throwing yourself on them. You must turn this incident to your advantage if you want to make progress with Agathe. She must be made to see that she does not hold you so securely that she might not lose you unless she makes more effort to keep you. After all that you have done, and still to be only on hand-kissing terms!

"Tandis que Jacques vide à terre sa gourde, son maître regarde à sa montre, ouvre sa tabatière, et se dispose à continuer l’histoire de ses amours. Et moi, lecteur, je suis tenté de lui fermer la bouche en lui montrant de loin ou un vieux militaire sur son cheval, le dos voûté, et s’acheminant à grands pas ; ou une jeune paysanne en petit chapeau de paille, en cotillons rouges, faisant son chemin à pied ou sur un âne. Et pourquoi le vieux militaire ne serait-il pas ou le capitaine de Jacques ou le camarade de son capitaine ? – Mais il est mort. – Vous le croyez… ? Pourquoi la jeune paysanne ne serait-elle pas ou la dame Suzon, ou la dame Marguerite, ou l’hôtesse du Grand-Cerf, ou la mère Jeanne, ou même Denise, sa fille ? Un faiseur de romans n’y manquerait pas ; mais je n’aime pas les romans, à moins que ce ne soit ceux de Richardson. Je fais l’histoire, cette histoire intéressera ou n’intéressera pas : c’est le moindre de mes soucis. Mon projet est d’être vrai, je l’ai rempli. Ainsi, je ne ferai point revenir frère Jean de Lisbonne ; ce gros prieur qui vient à nous dans un cabriolet, à côté d’une jeune et jolie femme, ce ne sera point l’abbé Hudson. – Mais l’abbé Hudson est mort ? – Vous le croyez ? Avez-vous assisté à ses obsèques ? – Non. – Vous ne l’avez point vu mettre en terre ? – Non. – Il est donc mort ou vivant, comme il me plaira. Il ne tiendrait qu’à moi d’arrêter ce cabriolet, et d’en faire sortir avec le prieur et sa compagne de voyage une suite d’événements en conséquence desquels vous ne sauriez ni les amours de Jacques, ni celles de son maître ; mais je dédaigne toutes ces ressources-là, je vois seulement qu’avec un peu d’imagination et de style, rien n’est plus aisé que de filer un roman. Demeurons dans le vrai, et en attendant que le mal de gorge de Jacques se passe, laissons parler son maître.","While Jacques empties his water bottle on the ground, his master looks at his watch, opens his snuffbox, and prepares to continue the story of his love. And I, the reader, am tempted to shut his mouth by showing him from afar either an old soldier on his horse, his back bent, and advancing with great strides; or a young peasant woman in a little straw hat, in red petticoats, making her way on foot or on a donkey. And why shouldn't the old soldier be either Jacques' captain or his captain's comrade? - But he is dead. ""Do you believe it...?"" Why wouldn't the young peasant girl be either Dame Suzon, or Dame Marguerite, or the hostess of the Grand-Cerf, or Mother Jeanne, or even Denise, her daughter? A writer of novels would not miss it; but I don't like novels, unless it's Richardson's. I make history, this history will interest or it will not interest: that is the least of my worries. My project is to be true, I have fulfilled it. Thus, I will not bring Brother John back from Lisbon; this fat prior who comes to us in a cabriolet, beside a young and pretty woman, it will not be Abbé Hudson. ""But Father Hudson is dead?"" – Do you believe it? Did you attend his funeral? - Nope. ""Did you not see him buried?"" - Nope. “So he is dead or alive, as I please. It would be up to me to stop this cabriolet, and to bring out with the prior and his traveling companion a series of events in consequence of which you would know neither the loves of Jacques, nor those of his master; but I disdain all these resources, I only see that with a little imagination and style, nothing is easier than spinning a novel. Let's stay true, and while waiting for Jacques' sore throat to pass, let his master speak.","While Jacques empties his gourd on to the ground, his Master looks at his watch, opens his snuffbox, and gets ready to resume the story of his loves. Speaking for myself, Reader, I'm tempted to shut him up by pointing out to him, in the distance, either an old soldier bent over the neck of his horse who was coming up fast, or a young peasant girl wearing a little straw hat and red petticoats who was proceeding on foot or on a mule. Now why shouldn't the old soldier turn out to be either Jacques's Captain or the friend of his Captain? But he's dead. You think so? Why shouldn't the young peasant girl be Madame Suzanne or Madame Marguerite or the landlady of the Stag Inn, or Jeanne, or even her daughter Denise? A novelist would never pass up such an opportunity, but I don't care for novels, unless they're by Richardson. * I'm writing a chronicle here. This story will either be interesting or it won't, though that's neither here nor there. My intention was to be true and in this I have succeeded. That is why I shan't be bringing back Frere Jean of Lisbon. The portly abbot now approaching in a fly with a pretty young woman next to him won't be Hudson. But Hudson is dead. You think so? Did you go to his funeral? No. Did you see him committed to the earth? No. Then he's alive or dead, as I decide. If I wanted to, I could bring the above-mentioned fly to a halt and from it decant the abbot, his companion, and a whole series of adventures which would ensure you'd never get to know about Jacques's love-life or his Master's. But I wouldn't stoop so low. It just seems obvious to me that with a little imagination and style, there's nothing easier than churning out a novel. We'll stick with the truth and, while we're waiting for Jacques to get over his sore throat, let's hear what his Master has got to say.","While Jacques was emptying out his gourd his master looked at his watch, opened his snuff-box, and prepared to continue the story of his loves. But, as for me, Reader, I am tempted to shut his mouth by showing him, in the distance, either an old soldier on a horse, his back stooped, coming towards them rapidly, or a young peasant girl, wearing a little straw hat and red petticoats, going her way on foot, or on a donkey. And why shouldn’t this old soldier be Jacques’ Captain or his Captain’s friend? – But he’s dead! You think so? And why shouldn’t the young peasant girl be Suzon or Marguerite, or the hostess of the Grand-Cerf, or mother Jeanne, or even Denise, her daughter?

I am writing history: either this story will be interesting or it won’t be interesting, but that is the least of my worries. My project is to be truthful and I have fulfilled it. So I will not have brother Jean return from Lisbon. That fat prior coming towards us in a gig with a pretty young lady sitting beside him will not be Father Hudson. – But Father Hudson is dead. You believe so? Were you at his funeral? – No. You didn’t see him buried? – No. Then he is either dead or alive, as you please. It is entirely up to me whether or not I stop this gig and bring out of it along with the Prior and his travelling companion a series of events, the result of which would be that you would know neither Jacques’ loves nor those of his master. But I disdain all these expedients. I can see that with only a little bit of imagination and style, nothing is easier to rattle off than a novel. But let us stick to the truth, and while we are waiting for Jacques’ sore throat to go away, let us allow his master to speak."

Vous y étiez avant que d’y entrer, et vous y serez encore quand vous en sortirez. » – Entrèrent-ils dans ce château ? – Non, car l’inscription était fausse, ou ils y étaient avant que d’y entrer. – Mais du moins ils en sortirent ? – Non, car l’inscription était fausse, ou ils y étaient encore quand ils en furent sortis. – Et que firent-ils là ? – Jacques disait ce qui était écrit là-haut ; son maître, ce qu’il voulut : et ils avaient tous deux raison. – Quelle compagnie y trouvèrent ils ? – Mêlée. – Qu’y disait-on ? – Quelques vérités, et beaucoup de mensonges. – Y avait-il des gens d’esprit ? – Où n’y en avait-il pas ? et de maudits questionneurs qu’on fuyait comme la peste. Ce qui choqua le plus Jacques et son maître pendant tout le temps qu’ils s’y promenèrent. – On s’y promenait donc ? – On ne faisait que cela, quand on n’était pas assis ou couché… Ce qui choqua le plus Jacques et son maître, ce fut d’y trouver une vingtaine d’audacieux, qui s’étaient emparés des plus superbes appartements, où ils se trouvaient presque toujours à l’endroit ; qui prétendaient, contre le droit commun et le vrai sens de l’inscription, que le château leur avait été légué en toute propriété ; et qui, à l’aide d’un certain nombre de vauriens à leurs gages, l’avaient persuadé à un grand nombre d’autres vauriens à leurs gages, tout prêts pour une petite pièce de monnaie à prendre ou assassiner le premier qui aurait osé les contredire : cependant au temps de Jacques et de son maître, on l’osait quelquefois. – Impunément ? – C’est selon.","While following this dispute over which they could have circled the globe without speaking for a moment and without agreeing, they were greeted by a storm which forced them to go… – Where? - Or ? reader, you are very inconveniently curious! And what the hell does that do to you? When I have told you that it is in Pontoise or Saint-Germain, Notre-Dame de Lorette or Saint-Jacques de Compostelle, will you be any further ahead? If you insist, I will tell you that they went towards… yes; why not?… towards an immense castle, on the frontispiece of which one read: “I belong to no one and I belong to everyone. You were there before you entered it, and you will still be there when you leave it. ""Did they enter this castle?"" – No, because the inscription was false, or they were there before entering. ""But at least they got out of it?"" “No, because the inscription was false, or they were still there when they came out. ""And what did they do there?"" – Jacques was saying what was written up there; his master, what he willed: and they were both right. ""What company did they find there?"" – Melee. - What did they say? – Some truths, and many lies. ""Were there any wits there?"" ""Where wasn't there?"" and cursed questioners who were avoided like the plague. This shocked Jacques and his master the most during all the time they walked there. ""So we were walking there?"" “We only did that, when we weren't sitting or lying down… What shocked Jacques and his master the most was to find about twenty daring people there, who had taken over the most superb apartments, where they were almost always upright; who claimed, against common law and the true meaning of the inscription, that the castle had been bequeathed to them in full ownership; and who, by the aid of a number of hired rascals, had persuaded him to a large number of other hired rascals, all ready for a small coin to take or assassinate the first who should dared to contradict them: however, in the time of Jacques and his master, people sometimes dared to do so. - With impunity? - It depends.","After this argument, with which they could have circled the globe without running out of things to say or agreeing, they were overtaken by a storm which obliged them to hurry on their way... Where to? Where? Reader, you and your curiosity are terrible nuisances. What's it matter to you? If I said Pontoise or Saint-Germain, or Notre Dame de Lorette or Saint Jacques of Compostella, would you be any the wiser? If you insist, I'll tell you they were making their way towards... yes, why not?... towards a huge castle over the gate of which was written this inscription: 'I belong to no one. I belong to everyone. You were here before you arrived and you will still be here when you've • gone.' And did they go inside the castle? No. Because unless what was written was wrong, they were already there before they arrived. But at least they left? No. Because unless what was written was wrong, they were still inside after they'd gone. What did they do there? Jacques said what it was written on high he would say, and his Master said whatever he liked, and they were both right. What sort of company did they find inside? Mixed. What did people say? Some truth and a lot of lies. Were there any clever people? Where are there not clever people? There were also a lot of people asking impertinent, tomfool questions whom everybody avoided like the plague. What shocked Jacques and his Master most the whole time they walked around... So they walked around? That's all anybody did, except when they were sitting or in bed. What shocked Jacques and his Master most was to discover that a score of rogues had taken over the best rooms where they stayed all the time, on top of each other. They claimed, against both common law and the true sense of the inscription, that the castle had been bequeathed exclusively to them as their property. With the backing of a handful of fat-arses in their pay, they had imposed this view on a large number of other fat-arses who were also in their pay, that is, who were ready for a small sum to hang or murder anyone who dared contradict them. Even so, at the time Jacques and his Master were there, some were still bold enough to do just that. Were they punished for it? Depends on what you mean.","While engaged in this discussion – and they could have travelled around the entire world without either pausing or agreeing – they were caught up in a storm which forced them to seek shelter. – Where? – Where? Reader, your curiosity is extremely annoying. What the devil does it have to do with you? If I told you it was Pontoise or Saint-Germain or Loreto or Compostella, would you be any the wiser?7 If you insist I will tell you that they made their way towards… yes, why not?… towards a huge château, on whose façade were inscribed the words: ‘I belong to nobody and I belong to everybody. You were here before you entered and you will still be here after you have left.’ – Did they go into this château? No, because either the inscription was a lie, or they were there before they went in. – Well, did they manage to leave, at least? No, because either the inscription was a lie, or they were still there after they left. – And what did they do there? Jacques said whatever it was written up above that he would say and his master whatever he liked. And they were both right. – What kind of people did they find there? A mixture. – What did they say? A few truths and a lot of lies. – Were there intelligent men there? Where are there not some? And damned questioners whom they avoided like the plague. The thing that most shocked Jacques and his master while they were walking about… – So they were walking, were they? They did nothing but that except when they were sitting down or sleeping. The thing which shocked Jacques and his master most was to find about twenty scoundrels there who had taken over all the most luxurious rooms, where, it appears, they stayed almost all the time crowded together and pretended, in defiance of customary right and the true meaning of the château’s inscription, that the château had been bequeathed to them lock, stock and barrel, and with the help of a certain number of pricks in their pay they had brought round to this view a great number of other pricks, also in their pay, who were quite prepared for the smallest sum of money to hang or kill the first man who dared contradict them. Nevertheless, in the days of Jacques and his master people sometimes dared. – With impunity? That depended."

"Mais, Jacques, vous pleurez, je crois !… « Pleurez sans contrainte, parce que vous pouvez pleurer sans honte ; sa mort vous affranchit des bienséances scrupuleuses qui vous gênaient pendant sa vie. Vous n’avez pas les mêmes raisons de dissimuler votre peine que celles que vous aviez de dissimuler votre bonheur ; on ne pensera pas à tirer de vos larmes les conséquences qu’on eût tirées de votre joie. On pardonne au malheur. Et puis il faut dans ce moment se montrer sensible ou ingrat, et tout bien considéré, il vaut mieux déceler une faiblesse que se laisser soupçonner d’un vice. Je veux que votre plainte soit libre pour être moins douloureuse, je la veux violente pour être moins longue. Rappelez-vous, exagérez-vous même ce qu’il était ; sa pénétration à sonder les matières les plus profondes ; sa subtilité à discuter les plus délicates ; son goût solide qui l’attachait aux plus importantes ; la fécondité qu’il jetait dans les plus stériles ; avec quel art il défendait les accusés : son indulgence lui donnait mille fois plus d’esprit que l’intérêt ou l’amour propre n’en donnait au coupable ; il n’était sévère que pour lui seul. Loin de chercher des excuses aux fautes légères qui lui échappaient, il s’occupait avec toute la méchanceté d’un ennemi à se les exagérer et avec tout l’esprit d’un jaloux à rabaisser le prix de ses vertus par un examen rigoureux des motifs qui l’avaient peut-être déterminé à son insu. Ne prescrivez à vos regrets d’autre terme que celui que le temps y mettra. Soumettons-nous à l’ordre universel lorsque nous perdons nos amis, comme nous nous y soumettrons lorsqu’il lui plaira de disposer de nous ; acceptons l’arrêt du sort qui les condamne, sans désespoir, comme nous l’accepterons sans résistance lorsqu’il se prononcera contre nous. Les devoirs de la sépulture ne sont pas les derniers devoirs des amis. La terre qui se remue dans ce moment se raffermira sur la tombe de votre amant ; mais votre âme conservera toute sa sensibilité. »","But, Jacques, you are crying, I believe!… “Cry without constraint, because you can cry without shame; his death frees you from the scrupulous proprieties which bothered you during his life. You do not have the same reasons for concealing your sorrow as you had for concealing your happiness; no one will think of drawing from your tears the consequences that would have been drawn from your joy. We forgive misfortune. And then it is necessary in this moment to be sensitive or ungrateful, and all things considered, it is better to detect a weakness than to be suspected of a vice. I want your complaint to be free to be less painful, I want it violent to be less long. Remember, even exaggerate what he was; his penetration to probe the deepest matters; his subtlety in discussing the most delicate; his solid taste which attached him to the most important; the fecundity he threw into the most sterile; with what art he defended the accused: his indulgence gave him a thousand times more wit than self-interest or self-love gave to the culprit; he was severe only for himself. Far from seeking excuses for the slight faults which escaped him, he busied himself with all the wickedness of an enemy in exaggerating them and with all the spirit of a jealous person in lowering the price of his virtues by a rigorous examination of the motives which had perhaps determined him without his knowledge. Do not prescribe for your regrets any term other than that which time will give. Let us submit to the universal order when we lose our friends, as we will submit to it when it pleases to dispose of us; let us accept the decree of fate which condemns them, without despair, as we will accept it without resistance when it decides against us. Burial duties are not the last duties of friends. The earth which is stirring at this moment will firm up on the tomb of your lover; but your soul will retain all its sensitivity. »","Why, Jacques, I do believe you're crying. Let your tears flow freely, because now you may shed them without shame. His death releases you from the strict proprieties which constrained you while he was alive. You no longer have the same reasons for withholding your grief as you then had for concealing your felicity. No one will seek to put upon your tears the same interpretation which might have been put on your happiness. Everything is forgiven those who grieve. Moreover, at this time, we are perforce revealed as either caring or unforgiving and, all things considered, it is better to stand accused of human frailty than to be suspected of indifference. I would rather your sorrow were freely expressed, for then it would be less anguished. I would have it extreme, for then it would have a shorter term. Remember, and with increase, what he was: the acuteness with which he plumbed the deepest questions, the subtlety he brought to the discussion of the most delicate issues, his solid sense of the true priorities which ensured he kept his mind fixed firmly on the most important problems, the generous light he threw on the most arid subjects, the supreme art he deployed as the champion of those who stood accused: his humanity gave him quicker wits than self-interest or egoism ever gave the guilty, and he was hard only on himself. Far from trying to excuse the trifling faults he committed, he was more intent than his worst enemy on magnifying them, and was keener than an envious rival to cast doubt on his own virtues by subjecting them to a rigorous analysis of the motives which might have unwittingly prompted them. Set no limit on your grief other than that which healing time alone prescribes. Let us submit to the universal law of things when we lose a friend, as we in turn shall submit when it is pleased to deal with us. Let us accept, unsorrowing, the sentence which fate pronounces on them, as we shall accept unresistingly the decree which it will issue against us. The duties of friends do not cease with the rites of burial. The earth which is still fresh at this moment will settle over the ashes of the man you loved so tenderly, but your heart will keep his memory alive.","But Jacques! I do believe you’re crying! Cry without restraint because you may cry without shame. His death has set you free from the scrupulous propriety which oppressed you during his life. You no longer have the same reasons to hide your grief as you had to hide your happiness. The same conclusion will not be drawn from your tears as from your joy. People forgive misfortune. And then in this moment one must show either feeling or ingratitude, and all things considered it is better to reveal a weakness than to allow oneself to be suspected of a vice. I would wish your grief to be unrestrained so that it might be less painful. I would wish it to be violent so that it might be less long. Remember him as he was and exaggerate even. Remember his acuity in getting to the bottom of the most profound matters, his subtlety in speaking of the most delicate, his sound good taste which made him value the most important, the fertility which he would bring to the most sterile matters. Remember the skill with which he would defend the accused. His indulgence gave him one thousand times more intelligence than interest or egoism gave to the guilty. He was severe only when it came to himself. Far from looking for excuses for the inconsequential faults which he might inadvertently commit he used to exaggerate them with all the hostility of an enemy, and he would debase the value of his virtues with all the venom of one who was envious of them by rigorous examination of the motives which had perhaps inspired them unbeknownst to him. Do not limit your grief to any period except the time it will take to heal. When we lose our friends let us submit ourselves to the order of the universe as we ourselves will submit to it when it sees fit to dispose of us. Let us accept without despair the decree of Fate which condemns them in the same way that we ourselves will accept it without resistance when it is pronounced against us. The duties of burial are not the final duties of friends. The earth that has been disturbed will settle over your lover’s ashes but your soul will retain all his sensibility."

Behind the one in the middle there was a tall mirror with a moulding that was too high for the ceiling, so that a good six inches of it was hidden by the chest. On these three chests were all manner of disparate objects, including two backgammon boards. All round the room were a good number of rather handsome chairs, though no two were alike. At the end of a bed which had no curtains there was a superb day-couch. Against one window stood a bird-cage which was new but without a tenant, and in front of another a chandelier hung from a broom-handle which rested at either end on the backs of two broken-down chairs with straw seats. And right, left, and centre were pictures, some on the walls and the rest stacked on top of each other.","He got dressed.

"La lettre qu’on donnait à lire au marquis avait été concertée entre elles. C’était la d’Aisnon fille qui paraissait l’avoir écrite par ordre de sa mère : et l’on y avait mis, d’honnête, de doux, de touchant, d’élégance et d’esprit, tout ce qui pouvait renverser la tête du marquis. Aussi en accompagnait-il chaque mot d’une exclamation ; pas une phrase qu’il ne relût ; il pleurait de joie ; il disait à Mme de La Pommeraye : « Convenez donc, madame, qu’on n’écrit pas mieux que cela.","The letter which was given to the Marquis to read had been concerted between them. It was the d'Aisnon girl who seemed to have written it by order of her mother: and they had put into it, honest, gentle, touching, elegance and wit, everything that could reverse the head of the marquis. He therefore accompanied each word with an exclamation; not a sentence he did not reread; he wept for joy; he would say to Madame de La Pommeraye: “Agree then, Madame, that one does not write better than that.","The letter she gave the Marquis to read had been concocted by all three of them. It appeared to have been written by the d'Aisnon girl at her mother's behest, and no effort had been spared to make it as honest, as sweet, as touching, as elegantly phrased, and as sensible as was required to turn the Marquis's head. Not surprisingly, he positively drooled over every word. He read each sentence several times, he wept tears of joy, and said to Madame de La Pommeraye: 'Come, Madame, surely you agree that no one could write a more perfect letter than that?'","The letter which she gave the Marquis to read had been composed between the three women. It came as if from the daughter following her mother’s instructions and they had contrived to make it honest, sweet, touching, elegant and witty – in short everything that would touch the Marquis’ heart. So, on reading it he exclaimed at every word. There was not a sentence he didn’t read twice."
"M. le marquis des Arcis et Mme de La Pommeraye s’embrassèrent, enchantés l’un de l’autre, et se séparèrent. Plus la dame s’était contrainte en sa présence, plus sa douleur fut violente quand il fut parti. « Il n’est donc que trop vrai, s’écria-t-elle, il ne m’aime plus !… » Je ne vous ferai point le détail de toutes nos extravagances quand on nous délaisse, vous en seriez trop vains. Je vous ai dit que cette femme avait de la fierté ; mais elle était bien autrement vindicative. Lorsque les premières fureurs furent calmées, et qu’elle jouit de toute la tranquillité de son indignation, elle songea à se venger, mais à se venger d’une manière cruelle, d’une manière à effrayer tous ceux qui seraient tentés à l’avenir de séduire et de tromper une honnête femme. Elle s’est vengée, elle s’est cruellement vengée ; sa vengeance a éclaté et n’a corrigé personne ; nous n’en avons pas été depuis moins vilainement séduites et trompées.","Monsieur le Marquis des Arcis and Madame de La Pommeraye embraced each other, enchanted with each other, and parted. The more the lady had restrained herself in his presence, the more violent her pain was when he was gone. “So it is only too true,” she cried, “he no longer loves me!…” I told you that woman had pride; but she was much more vindictive. When the first rages had calmed down, and she was enjoying all the tranquility of her indignation, she thought of revenge, but of revenge in a cruel way, in a way to frighten all those who might be tempted to do so. future to seduce and deceive an honest woman. She avenged herself, she avenged herself cruelly; his revenge broke out and corrected no one; we have not since been less wickedly seduced and deceived.","The Marquis des Arcis and Madame de La Pommeraye embraced, saying how very relieved they were, then went their separate ways. The tighter the rein the lady had kept on her feelings when he was there , the more violent was her reaction when he had gone. ' So, it's true,' she cried, 'he doesn't love me any more!' I won't go into details of the wild and foolish thoughts that run through women's heads when they've been deserted, it would make you men more vain than you are already. I have said the lady was proud, but she could also be very vindictive. When the first rush of fury had subsided and was replaced by a mood of cold indignation, her thoughts turned to revenge, a cruel revenge, a revenge such as would serve to put the fear of God into any man who might thereafter feel tempted to seduce and betray an honest woman. And she did avenge herself, she avenged herself in the cruellest way, and her vengeance was highly publicized and it mended nobody's ways. Since then, women have not been any less vilely seduced and betrayed.","Monsieur le Marquis des Arcis and Mme de La Pommeraye embraced, absolutely delighted with each other, and went their ways. But because she had suppressed her feelings so much when he was there, her grief was all the more violent when he had left. ‘It’s only too true…’ she cried out, ‘he doesn’t love me any more.’ I will not describe to you in detail all the wild and foolish things we women do when we are abandoned because that would only flatter your vanity. I have already told you that this woman was proud, but her pride was nothing to her vindictiveness. When her first furies had calmed and her mood turned to cold indignation her thoughts turned to avenging herself, and to avenging herself in a cruel way, in a way which would frighten all those who in future would be tempted to seduce and deceive honest women. She had her revenge, a cruel revenge, a public revenge, but it turned against her and served as a lesson to no one. Since that time we have not been any the less cruelly seduced or deceived."

"Cette énorme incision mit à découvert le fond de la blessure, d’où le chirurgien tira, avec ses pinces, une très petite pièce de drap de ma culotte qui y était restée, et dont le séjour causait mes douleurs et empêchait l’entière cicatrisation de mon mal. Depuis cette opération, mon état alla de mieux en mieux, grâce aux soins de Denise ; plus de douleurs, plus de fièvre ; de l’appétit, du sommeil, des forces. Denise me pansait avec exactitude et avec une délicatesse infinie. Il fallait voir la circonspection et la légèreté de main avec lesquelles elle levait mon appareil ; la crainte qu’elle avait de me faire la moindre douleur ; la manière dont elle baignait ma plaie ; j’étais assis sur le bord de mon lit ; elle avait un genou en terre, ma jambe était posée sur sa cuisse, que je pressais quelquefois un peu : j’avais une main sur son épaule ; et je la regardais faire avec un attendrissement que je crois qu’elle partageait. Lorsque son pansement était achevé, je lui prenais les deux mains, je la remerciais, je ne savais que lui dire, je ne savais comment je lui témoignerais ma reconnaissance ; elle était debout, les yeux baissés, et m’écoutait sans mot dire. Il ne passait pas au château un seul porte-balle, que je ne lui achetasse quelque chose ; une fois c’était un fichu, une autre fois c’était quelques aunes d’indienne ou de mousseline, une croix d’or, des bas de coton, une bague, un collier de grenat. Quand ma petite emplette était faite, mon embarras était de l’offrir, le sien de l’accepter. D’abord je lui montrais la chose ; si elle la trouvait bien, je lui disais : « Denise, c’est pour vous que je l’ai achetée… » Si elle l’acceptait, ma main tremblait en la lui présentant, et la sienne en la recevant. Un jour, ne sachant plus que lui donner, j’achetai des jarretières ; elles étaient de soie, chamarrées de blanc, de rouge et de bleu, avec une devise. Le matin, avant qu’elle arrivât, je les mis sur le dossier de la chaise qui était à côté de mon lit. Aussitôt que Denise les aperçut, elle dit : « Oh ! les jolies jarretières !","This huge incision uncovered the bottom of the wound, from which the surgeon pulled, with his forceps, a very small piece of sheet of my panties which had remained there, and whose stay caused my pain and prevented complete healing. of my pain. Since this operation, my condition has gotten better and better, thanks to Denise's care; more pain, more fever; appetite, sleep, strength. Denise dressed me with precision and infinite delicacy. You should have seen the circumspection and the lightness of the hand with which she lifted my camera; the fear she had of causing me the slightest pain; the way she bathed my wound; I was sitting on the edge of my bed; she had one knee on the ground, my leg was resting on her thigh, which I sometimes pressed a little: I had a hand on her shoulder; and I watched her do it with a tenderness which I believe she shared. When her dressing was finished, I took both her hands, I thanked her, I didn't know what to say to her, I didn't know how I would show her my gratitude; she was standing, her eyes lowered, and listening to me without saying a word. Not a single ball-carrier passed through the chateau without me buying something from him; once it was a kerchief, another time it was a few ells of calico or muslin, a gold cross, cotton stockings, a ring, a garnet necklace. When my little purchase was made, my embarrassment was to offer it, his to accept it. First I showed him the thing; if she found it good, I would say to her: ""Denise, I bought it for you..."" If she accepted it, my hand trembled as I held it out to her, and hers as I received it. One day, not knowing what to give her, I bought some garters; they were of silk, decorated with white, red and blue, with a motto. In the morning, before she arrived, I put them on the back of the chair which was beside my bed. As soon as Denise saw them, she said, “Oh! pretty garters!","The very deep incision reopened the wound all the way down, and from deep inside it the surgeon, using a pair of tweezers, extracted a tiny remnant of the twill of my breeches which was still embedded in it. Its presence had been causing the shooting pains and had prevented the wound from healing over. Once this operation had been performed, I got better and better, thanks to the good care Denise took of me. No more shooting pains, no more temperature. I had a healthy appetite, I slept well, and my strength returned. Denise changed my dressing regularly and was very gentle with me. If only you could have seen how gingerly, how deftly she removed my bandage , how afraid she was of causing me the smallest twinge of pain, how carefully she bathed my wound. I would sit on the edge of my bed, she would face me with one knee on the floor. My leg would rest on her thigh, to which I would sometimes apply faint pressure. I had one arm on her shoulder and would watch her work with a tenderness which I believe she shared. When I was bandaged up again, I took both her hands in mine, thanked her, though I didn't know what to say, I had no idea of what I could do to show her how grateful I was. She would stand there, staring at the ground, listening in silence to what I said. No pedlar ever called at the chateau without my buying something for her. Once it was a scarf, another time it was a few yards of calico or muslin, or a gold cross, a pair of cotton stockings, a ring, a garnet necklace. When I'd bought her something, I never knew how to give it to her and she never knew how to accept it. I'd start by showing it to her. If she said it was nice, then I'd say: 'Denise, I bought it for you.' If she accepted it, my hand would shake as I gave it to her, and her hand would shake as she took it. One day, not knowing what to get her, I bought garters. They were silk, with white, red, and blue embroidery and a pretty pattern. That morning, before she came, I put them on the back of the chair next to my bed. As soon as Denise saw them she cried: 'What beautiful garters!'","This enormous incision revealed the bottom of the wound out of which the surgeon pulled with his tweezers a very small piece of cloth from my breeches which had stayed there and whose presence was causing my pain and preventing the complete healing of the wound. After this operation my health got better and better, thanks to the attentions of Denise. There were no more attacks and no more fever. My appetite returned and I slept and grew stronger. Denise bandaged me with precision and infinite gentleness. You should have seen the cautiousness and dexterity of hand with which she used to undo my bandage, the fear she had of causing me pain, the way she used to bathe my wound. I used to be sitting on the edge of my bed and she would have one knee on the floor. My leg would rest on her thigh which I sometimes used to press a little. I used to have one hand on her shoulder and watch her do all this with a tenderness which I believe she shared. When my bandaging was finished I would take her two hands and thank her.

Once a neckerchief, another time a few lengths of calico or muslin, a golden cross, cotton stockings, a ring, a garnet necklace.

However Bigre, my godfather, said: “Children! cursed children! isn't there another one who distresses his father? Justine not being in bed, I suspected that she was underneath. The dive was completely blind. I bend down, I move my hands, I meet one of her arms, I seize her, I pull her to me; she comes out from under the bunk, trembling. I kiss her, I reassure her, I wave to her to go to bed. She joins her two hands, she throws herself at my feet, she hugs my knees. I would perhaps not have resisted this mute scene, if the day had enlightened it; but when darkness does not make one timid, it makes one enterprising. Besides, I had his old scorn on my heart. In response, I pushed her towards the stairs that led to the shop. She uttered a cry of fright. Bigre, who heard him, said: ""He's dreaming..."" Justine fainted; her knees give way beneath her; in her delirium she was saying in a stifled voice: ""He's coming... he's coming... I hear him rising... I'm lost!... - No, no, I replied in a stifled voice, get over yourself, shut up and go to bed…” She persists in her refusal; I hold firm: she resigns herself: and here we are, side by side.","I climb up, get undressed, pull back the blanket and the sheets, I feel all around: no Justine. Meanwhile, my godfather Buger was muttering: 'Children, damned children! There's another one who'll grieve his father's heart!' Since Justine wasn't in the bed, I deduced she must be under it. It was very dark up there. I bend down, reach out with my hands, feel one of her arms, grab it, and pull her towards me. She crawls out all of a tremble. I kiss her, say everything's all right, and motioned her to get into bed. She puts both hands together, kneels at my feet, and clasps me round the knees. If the loft had been light enough for me to see her, perhaps I mightn't have been unable to resist her unspoken pleading. But if the dark doesn't make you afraid, it makes you feel bold. Besides, I hadn't forgotten the way she'd given me the elbow. My answer was to push her towards the top of the ladder that led down to the shop. She gave a frightened squawk. Old Buger heard and said: 'He must be dreaming.' Justine faints, her legs buckle under her, and through her panic she says in a hoarse whisper: 'He's going to come... he's coming... I can hear him on the ladder... I'm lost!' 'No,' said I, also in a whisper, 'just get a grip on yourself, don't say anything, and get into bed.' This she stubbornly refused to do. I hold firm, she resigns herself, and there we are stretched out side by side.","I went up. I got undressed. I lifted up the blanket and the sheets and felt all around. No Justine. Meanwhile my godfather Bugger was muttering away downstairs: ‘Children! Damned children! There’s another one breaking his father’s heart.’ Since Justine was not in the bed I suspected she might be underneath it. The loft was quite dark. I got down and ran my hands around, met one of her hands, grabbed it and pulled her towards me. Out she came from under the bed trembling. I kissed her, reassured her, and indicated that she was to go to bed. She clasped her hands, threw herself at my feet and threw her arms around my knees. I might not perhaps have been able to resist this mute scene if the loft had been lit, but when darkness does not scare people it makes them enterprising. And anyway I was still bitter about her earlier rejection of me. By way of reply I pushed her towards the ladder which led down to the workshop. She let out a long cry of fear. Bugger heard this and said: ‘He must be dreaming.’ Justine fainted. Her knees gave way under her. In her delirium she said in a stifled voice: ‘He’s going to come… he’s coming… I can hear him coming up… I’m lost!’ ‘No, no,’ I replied in a muffled voice. ‘Calm down, shut up, and get into bed.’ She persisted in her refusal. I held firm. She resigned herself. And then there we were the one beside the other."

"« À peine furent-ils séparés, qu’ils sentirent le besoin qu’ils avaient l’un de l’autre ; ils tombèrent dans une mélancolie profonde. Mon capitaine demanda un congé de semestre pour aller prendre l’air natal ; mais à deux lieues de la garnison, il vend son cheval, se déguise en paysan et s’achemine vers la place que son ami commandait. Il paraît que c’était une démarche concertée entre eux. Il arrive… Va donc où tu voudras ! Y a-t-il encore là quelque gibet qu’il te plaise de visiter ?… Riez bien, monsieur ; cela est en effet très plaisant… Il arrive ; mais il était écrit là-haut que, quelques précautions qu’ils prissent pour cacher la satisfaction qu’ils avaient de se revoir et ne s’aborder qu’avec les marques extérieures de la subordination d’un paysan à un commandant de place, des soldats, quelques officiers qui se rencontreraient par hasard à leur entrevue et qui seraient instruits de leur aventure, prendraient des soupçons et iraient prévenir le major de la place.","“No sooner were they separated than they felt their need for each other; they fell into a deep melancholy. My captain asked for a semester's leave to get some fresh air; but two leagues from the garrison, he sells his horse, disguises himself as a peasant, and goes towards the place his friend commanded. It seems that it was a concerted approach between them. He's coming... So go where you want! Is there still some gallows there that you would like to visit?... Laugh well, sir; it is indeed very pleasant… He arrives; but it was written up there that, whatever precautions they took to hide the satisfaction they had of seeing each other again and only approaching each other with the outward signs of the subordination of a peasant to a local commander, soldiers, a few officers who would meet by chance at their interview and who would be informed of their adventure, would take suspicions and go to warn the local major.","The moment they were separated, each realized how much he was going to miss the other. Both fell into a state of profound melancholia. My Captain applied for six months' leave so that he might return to fill his lungs with the good air of home. But when he's ten miles or so from his barracks, he sells his horse, disguises himself as a peasant, and heads for the garrison where his friend had been posted. It seems to have been a move they'd planned together. He arrives... Oh, go on, have your head, then! Is there another gibbet round here you've taken a fancy to? Go on, sir, laugh away. Oh yes, very funny I'm sure!... he arrives. But it was written on high that for all the precautions they took to conceal the delight they felt when they saw each other again, and despite the care they took to ensure that the one approached the other with a visible display of the deference a peasant shows an adjutant, it was written that a group of soldiers and a handful of officers would happen to be there when they met who knew all about their goings-on, would become suspicious, and report what they'd seen to their commanding officer.","Hardly had they been separated when they realized how much they needed each other and they both fell into the most profound melancholy. My Captain asked for six months’ leave to go back home for a rest. When he was two leagues away from the garrison, he sold his horse, disguised himself as a peasant and made his way towards the fortress his friend commanded. It appears that this had been arranged between them. He arrived… Oh, go where you like! Is there another gibbet you’d like to visit? … It’s all right for you to laugh, Monsieur! I don’t find it at all funny!… He arrived. But it was written up above that, despite the precautions they took to hide the satisfaction they felt at seeing each other again and the care they took to approach each other with the external appearance of deference that might be expected of a peasant in the presence of the commanding officer of a fortress, some soldiers and some officers, who were by chance present at their meeting, and who happened to know of their past adventures, became suspicious and went to warn the adjutant of the fortress."

"À quelque temps de là, dame Marguerite, c’était la femme de notre autre goguenard, avait du grain à faire moudre et n’avait pas le temps d’aller au moulin ; elle vint demander à mon père un de ses garçons qui y allât pour elle. Comme j’étais le plus grand, elle ne doutait pas que le choix de mon père ne tombât sur moi, ce qui ne manqua pas d’arriver. Dame Marguerite sort ; je la suis ; je charge le sac sur son âne et je le conduis seul au moulin. Voilà son grain moulu, et nous nous en revenions, l’âne et moi, assez tristes, car je pensais que j’en serais pour ma corvée. Je me trompais. Il y avait entre le village et le moulin un petit bois à passer ; ce fut là que je trouvai dame Marguerite assise au bord de la voie. Le jour commençait à tomber. « Jacques, me dit-elle, enfin te voilà ! Sais-tu qu’il y a plus d’une mortelle heure que je t’attends ?… »","Some time later, Dame Marguerite, the wife of our other scoffer, had grain to grind and had no time to go to the mill; she came to ask my father for one of his boys to go there for her. As I was the tallest, she had no doubt that my father's choice would fall on me, which did not fail to happen. Dame Marguerite exits; I follow her; I load the sack onto his donkey and drive him alone to the mill. Here is his ground grain, and we came back from there, the donkey and I, rather sad, because I thought that I would be for my drudgery. I was wrong. Between the village and the mill there was a small wood to pass; it was there that I found Dame Marguerite seated by the side of the road. Day was beginning to fall. ""Jacques,"" she said to me, ""there you are at last!"" Do you know that I have been waiting for you for more than a mortal hour?...""","A little while after this, Madame Marguerite, who was the wife of the other wag, had a sack of grain she wanted ground but didn't have time to go to the mill herself. She came and asked my father for the loan of one of his sons who would go for her. As I was the biggest, she assumed that my father would choose me, and so it turned out. Madame Marguerite leaves and I follow. I load the sack on to the mule and drive it to the mill. The grain is ground and the mule and I set off back again, both feeling hard done by, for I was thinking I'd get nothing for my pains. I was wrong. Between the village and the mill, the way led through a small copse. There I found Madame Marguerite sitting by the side of the road. The light was beginning to fade. 'Jacques, there you are at last! Do you realize I've been waiting for you for an hour that has seemed an eternity?'","Some time after that Marguerite, the wife of the other joker, had some grain which needed milling and didn’t have the time to go to the mill. She came to ask my father if one of his boys could go for her. Since I was the biggest she was sure that his choice would fall on me – which it did. Marguerite left. I followed, loaded the sack on to the mule and drove it to the mill – alone. Her grain milled, we started on our way back – the mule and I – sadly, because I thought I would be left unrewarded for my pains. I was wrong. The road from the mill to the village passed through a little wood. It was there that I found Marguerite sitting by the roadside. Dusk was falling. ‘Jacques,’ she said to me, ‘there you are at last!

My master, my dear master, the story of the plaster of Desglands; you will be as short as you like, and yet the drowsiness that holds me, and of which I am not master, will dissipate and you will be able to count on my full attention.","Even if I am, sir, after you've chopped up the story of my love-life with all your questions and fanciful asides without a murmur of complaint from me, it seems only fair if I ask you to interrupt yours by telling me the story of Monsieur Desglands's patch. I owe him a great deal, for he it was who plucked me from the surgeon's house just when my money was running out and I had no idea what would happen to me. It was under his roof that I met Denise, and but for Denise I wouldn't have opened my mouth all the time we've been travelling. Sir, oh sir, let's have the story of Desglands's patch! Make it as short as you like, but while it's going on the drowsy numbness that's overcome me and about which I can do nothing will lift and then you can count on having my full attention.","What if I am, Master? After you have interrupted the story of my loves with a thousand questions and as many whims, without the least murmur on my part, can I not beg you to interrupt your own to tell me the story of Desglands’ spot, that good man to whom I owe so much, who took me out of the surgeon’s house at the very moment when, because of shortage of money, I knew not what was to become of me, and at whose house I met Denise, Denise without whom I would not have spoken one word to you this whole journey? My Master, my dear Master, the story of Desglands’ spot. You may be as brief as you like and in the meantime the drowsiness which grips me and of which I am not the master will disappear and you may count on all my attention."

"Après ce mot, il se mit à se promener en long et en large sans mot dire ; il allait aux fenêtres, il regardait le ciel, il s’arrêtait devant Mme de La Pommeraye ; il allait à la porte, il appelait ses gens à qui il n’avait rien à dire ; il les renvoyait ; il rentrait ; il revenait à Mme de La Pommeraye, qui travaillait sans l’apercevoir ; il voulait parler, il n’osait ; enfin Mme de La Pommeraye en eut pitié, et lui dit : « Qu’avez-vous ? On est un mois sans vous voir ; vous reparaissez avec un visage de déterré et vous rôdez comme une âme en peine.","After saying this, he began to walk up and down without saying a word; he went to the windows, he looked at the sky, he stopped in front of Madame de La Pommeraye; he went to the door, he called his people to whom he had nothing to say; he sent them away; he was returning; he returned to Madame de La Pommeraye, who worked without noticing him; he wanted to speak, he dared not; at last Madame de La Pommeraye took pity on him and said to him: ""What's the matter with you?"" We are a month without seeing you; you reappear with a dug-up face and you prowl around like a lost soul.","Whereupon he began pacing up and down without speaking. He stood at the window, he stared at the sky, he paused in front of Madame de La Pommeraye. He went to the door, summoned the servants, though he had no orders to give them, sent them away, came back, stood over Madame de La Pommeraye, who went on with her work and seemed not to notice, tried to say something, but did not dare. In the end, Madame de La Pommeraye took pity on him and said: 'What is it? You're not seen for a month, you reappear looking as if you'd returned from the grave, and you wander around the place like a soul in torment.'","At this point he started pacing up and down without saying a word. He went to the windows, looked out at the sky, stopped in front of Mme de La Pommeraye, went to the door, called his servants to whom he had nothing to say, sent them away again, came back in and came back to Mme de La Pommeraye, who was working and appeared not to notice.
