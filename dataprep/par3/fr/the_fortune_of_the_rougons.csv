"Je veux expliquer comment une famille, un petit groupe d’êtres, se comporte dans une société, en s’épanouissant pour donner naissance à dix, à vingt individus qui paraissent, au premier coup d’œil, profondément dissemblables, mais que l’analyse montre intimement liés les uns aux autres. L’hérédité a ses lois, comme la pesanteur.","I want to explain how a family, a small group of beings, behaves in a society, blooming to give birth to ten, twenty individuals who seem, at first glance, profoundly dissimilar, but who analysis shows intimately related to each other. Heredity has its laws, like gravity.","I wish to explain how a family, a small group of human beings, conducts itself in a given social system after blossoming forth and giving birth to ten or twenty members, who, though they may appear, at the first glance, profoundly dissimilar one from the other, are, as analysis demonstrates, most closely linked together from the point of view of affinity.

"« Voyons, dit-il enfin, vous êtes malheureux et j’ai pitié de vous. Bien que vous m’ayez cruellement insulté, je n’oublie pas que nous avons la même mère. Mais si je vous donne quelque chose, sachez que je le fais par bonté et non par crainte… Voulez-vous cent francs pour vous tirer d’affaire ? »","“Come now,” he said at last, “you are unhappy and I pity you. Although you cruelly insulted me, I do not forget that we have the same mother. But if I give you something, know that I do it out of kindness and not out of fear. Do you want a hundred francs to get you out of trouble? »","“Look here,” he said at last, “you’re unfortunate, and I pity you. Although you have cruelly insulted me, I can’t forget that we are children of the same mother. If I give you anything, however, you must understand I give it you out of kindness, and not from fear.

"Tous retombèrent sur leurs sièges, en poussant de gros soupirs. On put alors avoir quelques détails. Le messager avait rencontré la colonne aux Tulettes, et s’était empressé de revenir.","They all fell back into their seats, heaving heavy sighs. We could then have some details. The messenger had met the column at Tulettes, and hastened to return.","Everyone sank back in his chair again, heaving long-drawn sighs. They then obtained a few particulars.

He had encountered the column at Les Tulettes, and had hurried straight back to Plassans."
"Et, comme Miette semblait ne pouvoir détacher les yeux de cette arme qu’il avait si sottement laissée sur l’herbe, il se leva et la glissa de nouveau dans le tas de planches.","And, as Miette seemed unable to take her eyes off the weapon which he had so foolishly left on the grass, he got up and slipped it back into the pile of planks.","Then, as Miette could not remove her eyes from the weapon which he had so foolishly left on the grass, he jumped up and again hid it among the woodstacks.","Then, as Miette could not take her eyes off the weapon he had so foolishly left on the grass, he jumped up and hid it once more among the planks."
"– Mais il n’y a pas de manigances, reprit Félicité, souriant des scrupules du vieux coquin. Rien de plus simple : vous allez sortir tout à l’heure de ce cabinet, vous irez vous cacher chez votre mère, et ce soir, vous réunirez vos amis, vous viendrez reprendre la mairie. »","""But there's no scheming,"" continued Félicité, smiling at the scruples of the old rascal. Nothing could be simpler: you are going to leave this office presently, you will go and hide with your mother, and this evening, you will gather your friends, you will come to take over the town hall. »","“But there are no underhand dealings about it,” Félicité resumed, smiling at the old rascal’s scruples. “Nothing can be more simple: you will presently leave this room, and go and conceal yourself in your mother’s house, and this evening you can assemble your friends and come and seize the town-hall again.”","‘But there’s nothing underhand about it,’ Félicité resumed, smiling at the old rogue’s scruples. ‘Nothing could be simpler: you will leave this room and go and hide in your mother’s house, and this evening you will get your friends together and come and recapture the town hall.’"
« Ta main te fait toujours souffrir ? » lui demanda railleusement Félicité.,"""Your hand still hurts you?"" Felicity asked him mockingly.","“Does your hand still pain you?” his mother asked him, ironically.",‘Does your arm still hurt?’ his mother asked ironically.
"Félicité semblait ne pas avoir vieilli ; c’était toujours la même petite femme noire, ne pouvant rester en place, bourdonnante comme une cigale. Un passant qui l’eût vue de dos, sur un trottoir, l’eût prise pour une fillette de quinze ans, à sa marche leste, aux sécheresses de ses épaules et de sa taille. Son visage lui-même n’avait guère changé, il s’était seulement creusé davantage, se rapprochant de plus en plus du museau de la fouine ; on aurait dit la tête d’une petite fille qui se serait parcheminée sans changer de traits.","Felicite seemed not to have aged; it was still the same little black woman, unable to sit still, buzzing like a cicada. A passer-by who had seen her from behind, on a sidewalk, would have taken her for a little girl of fifteen, from her brisk walk, the dryness of her shoulders and her waist. His face itself had hardly changed, it had only hollowed out more, coming closer and closer to the weasel's muzzle; it looked like the head of a little girl parchmented without changing its features.","Félicité did not appear to have aged; she was still the same dark little woman, ever on the move, buzzing about like a grasshopper. Any person walking behind her on the pavement would have thought her a girl of fifteen, from the lightness of her step and the angularity of her shoulders and waist. Even her face had scarcely undergone any change; it was simply rather more sunken, rather more suggestive of the snout of a pole-cat.","Félicité did not seem to have aged; she was still the same dark little woman, ever on the move, buzzing about like a cicada. Anyone walking behind her on the footpath would have thought, from the lightness of her step, the angle of her shoulders, and the slimness of her waist, that she was a girl of fifteen. Even her face was virtually unchanged; it was simply a little more sunken, having become more and more like the snout of a polecat; it was like the face of a young girl who had shrivelled up without any of her features having changed."
– Eh bien ! courons… Nous avons deux bonnes lieues à faire. Tu te réchaufferas. »,- Well ! let's run… We have two good leagues to go. You will warm up. »,“We have still two good leagues to go. You will get warm.”,‘We’ve still quite a few miles to go. It will warm you up.’
"« Quels gueux ! murmurait le commandant, appuyé à la rampe d’une fenêtre, comme sur le velours d’une loge de théâtre ; et dire qu’il ne viendra pas une ou deux batteries pour me nettoyer toute cette canaille ! »","“What rascals! murmured the Commandant, leaning against a window railing, as on the velvet of a theater box; and to think that not one or two batteries will come to clean up all this scoundrel for me! »","“The villains!” muttered the Commander, leaning upon a window-bar, as though bending over the velvet-covered hand-rest of a box at a theatre: “To think that there isn’t a battery or two to make a clean sweep of all that rabble!”","‘The absolute villains!’ murmured the Commander, leaning on a window-bar as if it were the velvet hand-rest of a theatre box. ‘To think that there isn’t a battalion or two to come and make a clean sweep of that rabble!’"
"Puis, vers midi, il courut la ville ; il visita les postes, parlant d’une attaque possible, donnant à entendre que les insurgés n’étaient pas loin ; mais il comptait, disait-il, sur le courage des braves gardes nationaux ; s’il le fallait, ils devaient se faire tuer jusqu’au dernier pour la défense de la bonne cause. Quand il revint de cette tournée, lentement, gravement, avec l’allure d’un héros qui a mis ordre aux affaires de sa patrie, et qui n’attend plus que la mort, il put constater une véritable stupeur sur son chemin ; les promeneurs du Cours, les petits rentiers incorrigibles qu’aucune catastrophe n’aurait pu empêcher de venir bayer au soleil, à certaines heures, le regardèrent passer d’un air ahuri, comme s’ils ne le reconnaissaient pas et qu’ils ne pussent croire qu’un des leurs, qu’un ancien marchand d’huile eût le front de tenir tête à toute une armée.","Then, around noon, he ran through the town; he visited the posts, speaking of a possible attack, giving to understand that the insurgents were not far away; but he counted, he said, on the courage of the brave National Guards; if necessary, they had to kill every last one for the defense of the good cause. When he returned from this tour, slowly, gravely, with the allure of a hero who has put his country's affairs in order, and who now only awaits death, he was able to observe a real astonishment on his way; the walkers of the Cours, the incorrigible little rentiers whom no catastrophe could have prevented from coming to bay in the sun at certain hours, watched him pass with a bewildered air, as if they did not recognize him and that they did not could believe that one of their own, a former oil merchant, had the nerve to stand up to a whole army.","Then, towards noon, he passed through the town and visited the guard-houses, speaking of a possible attack, and letting it be understood, that the insurgents were not far off; but he relied, he said, on the courage of the brave national guards. If necessary they must be ready to die to the last man for the defence of the good cause. When he returned from this round, slowly and solemnly, after the manner of a hero who has set the affairs of his country in order, and now only awaits death, he observed signs of perfect stupor along his path; the people promenading in the Cours, the incorrigible little householders, whom no catastrophe would have prevented from coming at certain hours to bask in the sun, looked at him in amazement, as if they did not recognize him, and could not believe that one of their own set, a former oil-dealer, should have the boldness to face a whole army.","Then, at about noon, he proceeded through the town and visited the guardhouses, speaking of a possible attack and letting it be understood that the insurgents were not far off; but he was counting, he said, on the courage of the brave Guardsmen. If necessary, they must all be ready to lay down their lives for the cause. When he returned from his round, slowly and solemnly, with all the airs of a hero who had put the affairs of his country in order and now awaited only death, he observed reactions of total stupefaction; the people strolling along the Cours, the imperturbable little rentiers whom no catastrophe would have prevented from coming at certain allotted times to sunbathe, stared at him in amazement as if they did not recognize him, and could not believe that one of their own, a former oil-dealer, should be bold enough to confront a whole army."
"« Mon cher marquis, dit Rougon en lui présentant les membres de la commission municipale, nous avons un service à vous demander. Pourriez-vous nous faire conduire dans le jardin de l’hôtel ?","""My dear marquis,"" said Rougon, presenting to him the members of the municipal commission, ""we have a favor to ask of you.""

"Le conciliabule terminé, ces messieurs revinrent se mêler aux groupes qui emplissaient le salon. Ils durent enfin satisfaire la curiosité générale. Il leur fallut détailler par le menu les événements de la matinée. Rougon fut magnifique. Il amplifia encore, orna et dramatisa le récit qu’il avait conté à sa femme.

À chaque nouveau détail, une interruption partait.","The meeting over, these gentlemen returned to mingle with the groups that filled the drawing-room. They finally had to satisfy the general curiosity. They had to detail the events of the morning in detail. Rougon was magnificent.

They were at last obliged to satisfy the general curiosity by giving detailed accounts of recent events. Rougon proved magnificent. He exaggerated, embellished, and dramatised the story which he had related to his wife. The distribution of the guns and cartridges made everybody hold their breath.

"Et une discussion s’engageait sur la façon de grimper le long des peupliers. Miette donnait son avis nettement, comme un garçon.","And a discussion began on how to climb along the poplars.

"– Aucune, tu le sais bien, répondit-elle ; tu exposais toi-même la situation tout à l’heure ; nous n’avons de secours à attendre de personne ; nos enfants eux-mêmes nous ont trahis.","“None, as you well know,” she answered; you yourself explained the situation just now; we have no help to expect from anyone; our children themselves have betrayed us.","“None, you know very well,” she replied; “you explained the situation yourself just now; we have no help to expect from anyone; even our children have betrayed us.”","‘Yes, you know very well,’ she replied. ‘You explained the situation yourself just now; we can’t expect any help from anyone; even our children have betrayed us.’"
"« Ah ! tenez ! reprit-il au bout d’un silence. Au-delà de la Viorne, près de cette masse noire.","“Oh! hold ! he resumed after a silence.

"– Mais comment la crise est-elle venue ? » demanda Rougon impatienté, ne sachant plus de quelle façon quitter la chambre.","– But how did the crisis come about? asked Rougon impatiently, not knowing how to leave the room.","“But how did the attack begin?” Rougon impatiently inquired, at a loss for an excuse to leave the room.","‘But what could have brought it on?’ Rougon asked impatiently, anxious to find some excuse to leave."
"– Mais, vous comprenez, on a peur, on dit que ce retard des soldats n’est pas naturel, et que les insurgés pourraient bien les avoir massacrés. »","– But, you understand, we are afraid, we say that this delay of the soldiers is not natural, and that the insurgents could well have massacred them. »","“Well, you know, folks are beginning to feel rather frightened; they say that this delay on the part of the soldiers isn’t natural, and that the insurgents may well have slaughtered them.”","‘Well, you know, people are frightened; they say this delay in the soldiers arriving isn’t normal, and that the insurgents might well have slaughtered them.’"
"Une fois encore, Plassans vit passer, dans le clair de lune muet de ses rues, des hommes armés qui filaient le long des maisons. Lorsque la bande se trouva réunie devant l’hôtel de ville, Macquart, tout en ayant l’œil au guet, s’avança hardiment. Il frappa, et quand le concierge, dont la leçon était faite, demanda ce qu’on voulait, il lui fit des menaces si épouvantables, que cet homme, feignant l’effroi, se hâta d’ouvrir. La porte tourna lentement, à deux battants. Le porche se creusa, vide et béant.","Once more, Plassans saw passing, in the mute moonlight of its streets, armed men who slipped past the houses. When the band found themselves assembled in front of the Hôtel de Ville, Macquart, while keeping an eye on the watch, advanced boldly.

The door turned slowly, twice. The porch hollowed out, empty and gaping.","Once more Plassans beheld a band of armed men filing along close to the houses, in the quiet moonlight.

He knocked, and when the door-keeper, who had learnt his lesson, asked what was wanted, he uttered such terrible threats, that the man, feigning fright, made haste to open the door. Both leaves of it swung back slowly, and the porch then lay open and empty before them, while Macquart shouted in a loud voice: “Come on, my friends!”","Once more Plassans beheld a band of armed men filing through the streets by the light of the moon.

"Alors, l’oncle et le neveu se lançaient dans la haute politique. Fine et Gervaise, en les voyant aux prises, allaient se coucher doucement, sans qu’ils s’en aperçussent. Jusqu’à minuit, les deux hommes restaient ainsi à commenter les nouvelles de Paris, à parler de la lutte prochaine et inévitable. Macquart déblatérait amèrement contre les hommes de son parti ; Silvère rêvait tout haut, et pour lui seul, son rêve de liberté idéale. Étranges entretiens, pendant lesquels l’oncle se versait un nombre incalculable de petits verres, et dont le neveu sortait gris d’enthousiasme. Antoine ne put cependant jamais obtenir du jeune républicain un calcul perfide, un plan de guerre contre les Rougon ; il eut beau le pousser, il n’entendit sortir de sa bouche que des appels à la justice éternelle, qui tôt ou tard punirait les méchants.","Then, the uncle and the nephew launched themselves into high politics. Fine and Gervaise, seeing them struggling, went to bed quietly, without their perceiving it. Until midnight the two men remained thus to comment on the news from Paris, to speak of the approaching and inevitable struggle. Macquart ranted bitterly against the men of his party; Silvere was dreaming aloud, and for himself alone, his dream of ideal freedom. Strange conversations, during which the uncle poured himself an incalculable number of small glasses, and from which the nephew emerged drunk with enthusiasm. Antoine, however, was never able to obtain from the young republican a perfidious calculation, a plan of war against the Rougons; in vain did he push him, he only heard from his mouth cries for eternal justice, which sooner or later would punish the wicked.","Thereupon uncle and nephew launched out into high politics.

« Les soldats ! les soldats ! »,""" The troops ! the troops ! »",“The soldiers! The soldiers!”,‘The soldiers! The soldiers!’
"Antoine sentait à quel point son attitude devait consterner les Rougon, et c’était uniquement pour les mettre à bout de patience, qu’il affectait, de jour en jour, des convictions plus farouches. Au café, il appelait Pierre « mon frère », d’une voix qui faisait retourner tous les consommateurs ; dans la rue, s’il venait à rencontrer quelque réactionnaire du salon jaune, il murmurait de sourdes injures que le digne bourgeois, confondu de tant d’audace, répétait le soir aux Rougon en paraissant les rendre responsables de la mauvaise rencontre qu’il avait faite.","Antoine felt how much his attitude must have dismayed the Rougons, and it was only to put them to the end of their patience that he affected, day by day, more savage convictions. At the cafe, he called Pierre ""my brother"", in a voice that made all the consumers turn around; in the street, if he happened to meet some reactionary from the yellow salon, he murmured deaf insults which the worthy bourgeois, confounded by so much audacity, repeated in the evening to the Rougons, seeming to make them responsible for the bad meeting he had done.","Antoine knew what consternation his demeanour must cause the Rougons, and it was solely for the purpose of exhausting their patience that he from day to day affected fiercer opinions. At the cafe he frequented he used to speak of “my brother Pierre” in a voice which made everybody turn round; and if he happened to meet some reactionary from the yellow drawing-room in the street, he would mutter some low abuse which the worthy citizen, amazed at such audacity, would repeat to the Rougons in the evening, as though to make them responsible for his disagreeable encounter.","Antoine knew how much his behaviour must dismay the Rougons, and it was precisely in order to exhaust their patience that he affected ever-more extreme opinions.

"Et, comme Silvère gardait le silence, elle vit qu’elle l’avait mécontenté. Toute sa fièvre tomba. Elle balbutia d’une voix suppliante :","And, as Silvere remained silent, she saw that she had displeased him. All his fever fell.

"Lui, voulait se vendre, le plus cher possible. Sa grande inquiétude fut dès lors de prendre le vent, de se mettre toujours du côté de ceux qui pourraient, à l’heure du triomphe, le récompenser magnifiquement. Par malheur, il marchait en aveugle ; il se sentait perdu, au fond de sa province, sans boussole, sans indications précises. En attendant que le cours des événements lui traçât une voie sûre, il garda l’attitude de républicain enthousiaste prise par lui dès le premier jour. Grâce à cette attitude, il resta à la sous-préfecture ; on augmenta même ses appointements. Mordu bientôt par le désir de jouer un rôle, il détermina un libraire, un rival de Vuillet, à fonder un journal démocratique, dont il devint un des rédacteurs les plus âpres. L’Indépendant fit, sous son impulsion, une guerre sans merci aux réactionnaires. Mais le courant l’entraîna peu à peu, malgré lui, plus loin qu’il ne voulait aller ; il en arriva à écrire des articles incendiaires qui lui donnaient des frissons lorsqu’il les relisait. On remarqua beaucoup, à Plassans, une série d’attaques dirigées par le fils contre les personnes que le père recevait chaque soir dans le fameux salon jaune. La richesse des Roudier et des Granoux exaspérait Aristide au point de lui faire perdre toute prudence. Poussé par ses aigreurs jalouses d’affamé, il s’était fait de la bourgeoisie une ennemie irréconciliable, lorsque l’arrivée d’Eugène et la façon dont il se comporta à Plassans vinrent le consterner. Il accordait à son frère une grande habileté. Selon lui, ce gros garçon endormi ne sommeillait jamais que d’un œil, comme les chats à l’affût devant un trou de souris. Et voilà qu’Eugène passait les soirées entières dans le salon jaune, écoutant religieusement ces grotesques que lui, Aristide, avait si impitoyablement raillés. Quand il sut, par les bavardages de la ville, que son frère donnait des poignées de main à Granoux et en recevait du marquis, il se demanda avec anxiété ce qu’il devait croire. Se serait-il trompé à ce point ? Les légitimistes ou les orléanistes auraient-ils quelque chance de succès ? Cette pensée le terrifia. Il perdit son équilibre, et, comme il arrive souvent, il tomba sur les conservateurs avec plus de rage, pour se venger de son aveuglement.","He wanted to sell himself as expensive as possible. His great concern was therefore to take the wind, to always side with those who could, at the hour of triumph, reward him magnificently. Unfortunately, he was walking blind; he felt lost, in the depths of his province, without a compass, without precise directions. While waiting for the course of events to show him a safe path, he maintained the attitude of an enthusiastic republican which he had assumed from the first day. Thanks to this attitude, he remained at the sub-prefecture; his salary was even increased. Bitten soon by the desire to play a role, he persuaded a bookseller, a rival of Vuillet, to found a democratic newspaper, of which he became one of the harshest editors. The Independent made, under his impulse, a merciless war against the reactionaries. But the current carried him little by little, in spite of himself, further than he wanted to go; he came to write incendiary articles that gave him shivers when he read them again. There was much notice at Plassans of a series of attacks directed by the son against the people whom the father received each evening in the famous yellow salon. The wealth of the Roudiers and Granoux exasperated Aristide to the point of making him lose all prudence. Driven by his jealous bitterness of starvation, he had made an irreconcilable enemy of the bourgeoisie, when the arrival of Eugene and the way he behaved at Plassans came to dismay him. He granted his brother great skill. According to him, this sleeping fat boy never slept with more than one eye open, like cats on the prowl in front of a mouse hole. And now Eugene spent whole evenings in the yellow drawing room, listening religiously to those grotesques whom he, Aristide, had so pitilessly mocked. When he learned from the gossip of the town that his brother was shaking hands at Granoux and receiving handshakes from the marquis, he wondered anxiously what he should believe. Could he have been so wrong? Would the Legitimists or the Orleanists have any chance of success? This thought terrified him. He lost his balance, and, as often happens, he fell on the conservatives with more rage, to avenge himself for his blindness.","For his part he wanted to sell himself as dearly as possible. His great anxiety as to the direction in which the wind was blowing, so that he might invariably range himself on the side of that party, which, in the hour of triumph, would be able to reward him munificently. Unfortunately, he was groping in the dark. Shut up in his far away province, without a guide, without any precise information, he felt quite lost. While waiting for events to trace out a sure and certain path, he preserved the enthusiastic republican attitude which he had assumed from the very first day. Thanks to this demeanour, he remained at the Sub-Prefecture; and his salary was even raised. Burning, however, with the desire to play a prominent part, he persuaded a bookseller, one of Vuillet’s rivals, to establish a democratic journal, to which he became one of the most energetic contributors. Under his impulse the “Indépendant” waged merciless warfare against the reactionaries. But the current gradually carried him further than he wished to go; he ended by writing inflammatory articles, which made him shudder when he re-perused them. It was remarked at Plassans that he directed a series of attacks against all whom his father was in the habit of receiving of an evening in his famous yellow drawing-room. The fact is that the wealth of Roudier and Granoux exasperated Aristide to such a degree as to make him forget all prudence. Urged on by his jealous, insatiate bitterness, he had already made the middle classes his irreconcilable enemy, when Eugène’s arrival and demeanour at Plassans caused him great consternation. He confessed to himself that his brother was a skilful man. According to him, that big, drowsy fellow always slept with one eye open, like a cat lying in wait before a mouse-hole. And now here was Eugène spending entire evenings in the yellow drawing-room, and devoting himself to those same grotesque personages whom he, Aristide, had so mercilessly ridiculed. When he discovered from the gossip of the town that his brother shook hands with Granoux and the marquis, he asked himself, with considerable anxiety, what was the meaning of it? Could he himself have been deceived? Had the Legitimists or the Orleanists really any chance of success? The thought terrified him. He lost his equilibrium, and, as frequently happens, he fell upon the Conservatives with increased rancour, as if to avenge his own blindness.","For his part he wanted to sell himself to the highest bidder. His great concern now was to know exactly which way the wind was blowing, so that he could put himself in the best position, when the time came, to be handsomely rewarded by the victors. Unfortunately, he was groping in the dark; shut away in the provinces, without a guide, without any precise information, he felt quite lost. While waiting for events to give him a clear indication of what he should do, he maintained the enthusiasm for the Republic he had shown from the beginning. Thanks to this stance, he kept his job at the sub-prefecture building, and his salary was even raised. However, desperate to influence events, he persuaded a bookseller, a rival of Vuillet, to establish a democratic newspaper, to which he became one of the most outspoken contributors. At his urging, L’Indépendant waged a merciless campaign against the reactionaries. But the current gradually carried him further than he wanted to go; he began to write inflammatory articles, which made him shudder when he reread them. It became noticed in Plassans that he directed his attacks against all those whom his father received every evening in his famous yellow drawing-room. The fact was that the wealth of Roudier and Granoux galled Aristide so much that he threw all caution to the winds. Impelled by the jealousy and bitterness of one greedy for wealth, he had already made the bourgeoisie his irreconcilable enemy when Eugène’s arrival and behaviour in Plassans filled him with consternation. He could see that his brother was very clever. He always said that that big, slow-moving fellow always slept with one eye open, like a cat lying in wait near a mousehole. And here was Eugène spending entire evenings in the yellow drawing-room, listening reverently to the same grotesque individuals that he, Aristide, had so mercilessly ridiculed. When he discovered, from town gossip, that his brother was on familiar terms with Granoux and the Marquis, he began to wonder, not without a feeling of anxiety, what it all meant. Could he have misjudged the situation? Had the Legitimists or the Orleanists some chance of success? The thought terrified him. He got carried away and, as often happens, he attacked the conservatives with even greater ferocity, as if to avenge his own blindness."

"Ce mois de tendresse joueuse sauva Miette de ses désespoirs muets. Elle sentit se réveiller ses affections, ses insouciances heureuses d’enfant, que la solitude haineuse où elle vivait avait comprimées en elle. La certitude qu’elle était aimée par quelqu’un, qu’elle ne se trouvait plus seule au monde, lui rendit tolérables les persécutions de Justin et des gamins du faubourg. Il y avait maintenant une chanson dans son cœur qui l’empêchait d’entendre les huées. Elle pensait à son père avec une pitié attendrie, elle ne s’abandonnait plus aussi souvent à des rêveries d’implacable vengeance. Ses amours naissantes étaient comme une aube fraîche dans laquelle se calmaient ses mauvaises fièvres. Et en même temps une rouerie de fille amoureuse lui venait. Elle s’était dit qu’elle devait garder son attitude muette et révoltée, si elle voulait que Justin n’eût aucun soupçon. Mais, malgré ses efforts, lorsque ce garçon la blessait, il lui restait de la douceur plein les yeux ; elle ne savait plus où prendre le regard noir et dur d’autrefois. Il l’entendait aussi chantonner entre ses dents, le matin, au déjeuner.","This month of playful tenderness saved Miette from her mute despair. She felt her affections reawakening, her happy childish insouciances, which the hateful solitude in which she lived had compressed within her. The certainty that she was loved by someone, that she was no longer alone in the world, made the persecutions of Justin and the urchins of the faubourg tolerable to her. There was now a song in his heart that kept him from hearing the boos. She thought of her father with tender pity, she no longer abandoned herself so often to daydreams of implacable revenge. Her budding loves were like a fresh dawn in which her bad fevers subsided. And at the same time the trickery of a girl in love came to him. She had told herself that she had to keep her silent and rebellious attitude, if she wanted Justin to have no suspicions. But, despite her efforts, when this boy hurt her, there remained sweetness in her eyes; she no longer knew where to take the black and hard look of yesteryear. He also heard her humming between her teeth, in the morning, at lunch.","That month of playful love rescued Miette from her mute despair.

A song of joy, whose glad notes drowned their hootings, now sounded in her heart. She thought of her father with tender compassion, and did not now so frequently yield to dreams of bitter vengeance. Her dawning love cooled her feverish broodings like the fresh breezes of the dawn. At the same time she acquired the instinctive cunning of a young girl in love. She felt that she must maintain her usual silent and rebellious demeanour if she were to escape Justin’s suspicions. But, in spite of her efforts, her eyes retained a sweet unruffled expression when the lad bullied her; she was no longer able to put on her old black look of indignant anger. One morning he heard her humming to herself at breakfast-time.","That month with Silvère rescued Miette from her silent despair. She felt a renewal of her capacity for affection, and of her childish light-heartedness, which had been stifled by the loneliness of her life and the poisonous atmosphere in which she lived.

"L’idée de réussir, de voir toute sa famille arriver à la fortune, était devenue une monomanie chez Félicité. Pascal, pour ne pas la chagriner, vint donc passer quelques soirées dans le salon jaune. Il s’y ennuya moins qu’il ne le craignait. La première fois, il fut stupéfait du degré d’imbécillité auquel un homme bien portant peut descendre. Les anciens marchands d’huile et d’amandes, le marquis et le commandant eux-mêmes, lui parurent des animaux curieux qu’il n’avait pas eu jusque-là l’occasion d’étudier. Il regarda avec l’intérêt d’un naturaliste leurs masques figés dans une grimace, où il retrouvait leurs occupations et leurs appétits ; il écouta leurs bavardages vides, comme il aurait cherché à surprendre le sens du miaulement d’un chat ou de l’aboiement d’un chien. À cette époque, il s’occupait beaucoup d’histoire naturelle comparée, ramenant à la race humaine les observations qu’il lui était permis de faire sur la façon dont l’hérédité se comporte chez les animaux. Aussi, en se trouvant dans le salon jaune, s’amusa-t-il à se croire tombé dans une ménagerie. Il établit des ressemblances entre chacun de ces grotesques et quelque animal de sa connaissance. Le marquis lui rappela exactement une grande sauterelle verte, avec sa maigreur, sa tête mince et futée. Vuillet lui fit l’impression blême et visqueuse d’un crapaud. Il fut plus doux pour Roudier, un mouton gras, et pour le commandant, un vieux dogue édenté. Mais son continuel étonnement était le prodigieux Granoux. Il passa toute une soirée à mesurer son angle facial. Quand il l’écoutait bégayer quelque vague injure contre les républicains, ces buveurs de sang, il s’attendait toujours à l’entendre geindre comme un veau ; et il ne pouvait le voir se lever, sans s’imaginer qu’il allait se mettre à quatre pattes pour sortir du salon.","The idea of succeeding, of seeing her whole family achieve fortune, had become a monomania with Félicité. Pascal, so as not to upset her, came to spend a few evenings in the yellow drawing-room. He was less bored there than he feared. The first time he was amazed at the degree of imbecility to which a healthy man can descend. The former merchants of oil and almonds, the marquis and the commandant themselves, seemed to him curious animals which he had not hitherto had the opportunity to study. He gazed with the interest of a naturalist at their masks frozen in a grimace, in which he found their occupations and their appetites; he listened to their empty chatter, as he would have sought to catch the meaning of a cat's meow or a dog's bark. At this time he was much concerned with comparative natural history, bringing back to the human race the observations he was permitted to make of how heredity behaves in animals. So, finding himself in the yellow drawing-room, he amused himself by thinking he had fallen into a menagerie. He establishes resemblances between each of these grotesques and some animal he knows. The Marquis reminded her exactly of a tall green grasshopper, with its lean, slender head. Vuillet gave him the pale, slimy impression of a toad. He was kinder to Roudier, a fat sheep, and to the commandant, a toothless old mastiff. But his continual astonishment was the prodigious Granoux. He spent a whole evening measuring his facial angle. When he listened to her stammer out some vague insult against the republicans, those bloodthirsty drinkers, he always expected to hear her whine like a calf; and he could not see him get up without imagining that he was going to get on all fours to leave the drawing-room.","The idea of succeeding in life, of seeing all her family attain to fortune, had become a form of monomania with Félicité. Pascal, in order to be agreeable to her, came and spent a few evenings in the yellow drawing-room. He was much less bored there than he had apprehended. At first he was rather stupefied at the degree of imbecility to which sane men can sink. The old oil and almond dealers, the marquis and the commander even, appeared to him so many curious animals, which he had not hitherto had an opportunity of studying. He looked with a naturalist’s interest at their grimacing faces, in which he discerned traces of their occupations and appetites; he listened also to their inane chatter, just as he might have tried to catch the meaning of a cat’s mew or a dog’s bark.

"Dans un pareil esprit, ardent et contenu, les idées républicaines s’exaltèrent naturellement. Silvère, la nuit, au fond de son taudis, lisait et relisait un volume de Rousseau, qu’il avait découvert chez le fripier voisin, au milieu de vieilles serrures. Cette lecture le tenait éveillé jusqu’au matin. Dans le rêve cher aux malheureux du bonheur universel, les mots de liberté, d’égalité, de fraternité, sonnaient à ses oreilles avec ce bruit sonore et sacré des cloches qui fait tomber les fidèles à genoux. Aussi, quand il apprit que la République venait d’être proclamée en France, crut-il que tout le monde allait vivre dans une béatitude céleste. Sa demi-instruction lui faisait voir plus loin que les autres ouvriers, ses aspirations ne s’arrêtaient pas au pain de chaque jour ; mais ses naïvetés profondes, son ignorance complète des hommes, le maintenaient en plein rêve théorique, au milieu d’un Éden où régnait l’éternelle justice. Son paradis fut longtemps un lieu de délices dans lequel il s’oublia. Quand il crut s’apercevoir que tout n’allait pas pour le mieux dans la meilleure des républiques, il éprouva une douleur immense ; il fit un autre rêve, celui de contraindre les hommes à être heureux, même par la force. Chaque acte qui lui parut blesser les intérêts du peuple excita en lui une indignation vengeresse. D’une douceur d’enfant, il eut des haines politiques farouches. Lui qui n’aurait pas écrasé une mouche, il parlait à toute heure de prendre les armes. La liberté fut sa passion, une passion irraisonnée, absolue, dans laquelle il mit toutes les fièvres de son sang. Aveuglé d’enthousiasme, à la fois trop ignorant et trop instruit pour être tolérant, il ne voulut pas compter avec les hommes ; il lui fallait un gouvernement idéal d’entière justice et d’entière liberté. Ce fut à cette époque que son oncle Macquart songea à le jeter sur les Rougon. Il se disait que ce jeune fou ferait une terrible besogne, s’il parvenait à l’exaspérer convenablement. Ce calcul ne manquait pas d’une certaine finesse.","In such a spirit, ardent and restrained, republican ideas are naturally exalted. Silvère, at night, in the depths of his hovel, read and reread a volume of Rousseau, which he had discovered at the neighboring second-hand clothes dealer, among some old locks. This reading kept him awake until morning. In the dream dear to the unfortunate of universal happiness, the words of liberty, of equality, of fraternity, rang in his ears with that sonorous and sacred sound of bells which makes the faithful fall to their knees. Also, when he learned that the Republic had just been proclaimed in France, he believed that everyone was going to live in a heavenly bliss. His semi-education made him see farther than the other workmen, his aspirations did not stop at daily bread; but his profound naïveté, his complete ignorance of men, kept him in the midst of a theoretical dream, in the midst of an Eden where eternal justice reigned. His paradise was for a long time a place of delights in which he forgot himself. When he thought he noticed that all was not going well in the best of republics, he felt immense pain; he had another dream, that of forcing men to be happy, even by force. Every act which seemed to him to injure the interests of the people excited in him an avenging indignation. With the gentleness of a child, he had fierce political hatreds. He who would not have squashed a fly, he talked at all hours of taking up arms. Freedom was his passion, an unreasoning, absolute passion, into which he poured all the fever of his blood. Blinded by enthusiasm, at once too ignorant and too educated to be tolerant, he did not want to reckon with men; it needed an ideal government of complete justice and complete freedom. It was at this time that his uncle Macquart thought of throwing him at the Rougons. He told himself that this young madman would do a terrible job, if he succeeded in exasperating him suitably. This calculation was not lacking in a certain finesse.","A nature such as Silvère’s, ardent yet self-restrained, naturally cherished the most exalted republican ideas.

"Mais Félicité feignit de ne pas avoir entendu. Le cri de son mari l’avait profondément frappée. En effet, pourquoi Eugène n’écrivait-il pas à son père ?

"Alors, sans rien avouer, il confessa carrément qu’il voulait avoir la clientèle du collège. Autrefois, c’était lui qui fournissait l’établissement de livres classiques. Mais on avait appris qu’il vendait, sous le manteau, des pornographies aux élèves, en si grande quantité, que les pupitres débordaient de gravures et d’œuvres obscènes. À cette occasion, il avait même failli passer en police correctionnelle.

"Il lâcha prise, il retomba. Morte ! morte ! encore ce mot, qui sonnait comme un glas dans sa tête vide ! Quand il fut seul, il se traîna auprès du cadavre. Miette le regardait toujours. Alors il se jeta sur elle, roula sa tête sur sa gorge nue, baigna sa peau de ses larmes. Ce fut un emportement. Il posait furieusement les lèvres sur la rondeur naissante de ses seins, il lui soufflait dans un baiser toute sa flamme, toute sa vie, comme pour la ressusciter. Mais l’enfant devenait froide sous ses caresses. Il sentait ce corps inerte s’abandonner dans ses bras. Il fut pris d’épouvante ; il s’accroupit, la face bouleversée, les bras pendants, et il resta là, stupide, répétant :","He let go, he fell back. Dead! dead! that word again, which sounded like a death knell in his empty head! When he was alone, he dragged himself near the corpse. Miette was still watching him. So he threw himself on her, rolled his head on her bare throat, bathed her skin with his tears. It was an outburst. He placed his lips furiously on the budding roundness of her breasts, he breathed into her in a kiss all his flame, all his life, as if to resurrect her. But the child became cold under his caresses. He felt this inert body abandon itself in his arms. He was terrified; he squatted, his face upset, his arms hanging down, and he remained there, stupid, repeating:","At last Silvère released his hold and again fell back. Dead! Dead! Still that word, which rang like a knell in his dazed brain! When he was alone he crept up close to the corpse. Miette still seemed to be looking at him. He threw himself upon her, laid his head upon her bosom, and watered it with his tears. He was beside himself with grief. He pressed his lips wildly to her, and breathed out all his passion, all his soul, in one long kiss, as though in the hope that it might bring her to life again. But the girl was turning cold in spite of his caresses. He felt her lifeless and nerveless beneath his touch. Then he was seized with terror, and with haggard face and listless hanging arms he remained crouching in a state of stupor, and repeating: “She is dead, yet she is looking at me; she does not close her eyes, she sees me still.”","Silvère released his hold and again fell back. Dead! Dead! Again that word, sounding like a knell in his numbed brain! When he was alone he crept up close to the corpse. Miette was still looking at him. He threw himself upon her, laid his head on her bare breasts, and bathed her skin with his tears. He was carried away with grief. He pressed his lips furiously to her small round breasts, and breathed into her, with his kiss, all his passion and all his strength, as if trying to bring her to life again. But she was growing cold in spite of his caresses. He felt her inert body weighing heavily in his arms. He suddenly felt horror-struck; he remained crouching there, his grief written on his face, his arms hanging empty, as he went on repeating:"
"Brusquement, ils débouchèrent juste en face d’Orchères. De grands cris de joie, des brouhahas de foule leur arrivaient, clairs dans l’air limpide. La bande insurrectionnelle entrait à peine dans la ville. Miette et Silvère y pénétrèrent avec les traînards. Jamais ils n’avaient vu un enthousiasme pareil. Dans les rues, on eût dit un jour de procession, lorsque le passage du dais met les plus belles draperies aux fenêtres. On fêtait les insurgés comme on fête des libérateurs. Les hommes les embrassaient, les femmes leur apportaient des vivres. Et il y avait, sur les portes, des vieillards qui pleuraient. Allégresse toute méridionale qui s’épanchait d’une façon bruyante, chantant, dansant, gesticulant. Comme Miette passait, elle fut prise dans une immense farandole qui tournait sur la Grand-Place. Silvère la suivit. Ses idées de mort, de découragement, étaient loin à cette heure. Il voulait se battre, vendre du moins chèrement sa vie. L’idée de la lutte le grisait de nouveau. Il rêvait la victoire, la vie heureuse avec Miette, dans la grande paix de la République universelle.","Suddenly they emerged just opposite Orchères. Loud cries of joy, the hubbub of the crowd came to them, clear in the limpid air. The insurrectionary band had barely entered the city. Miette and Silvere entered it with the stragglers. They had never seen such enthusiasm. In the streets, it looked like a day of procession, when the passage of the canopy puts the most beautiful draperies on the windows. We celebrated the insurgents as we celebrate the liberators. The men kissed them, the women brought them food. And there were old men crying on the doors. Very southern joy that poured out in a noisy way, singing, dancing, gesticulating. As Miette passed, she was caught up in an immense farandole which circled the Grand-Place. Silvere followed her. His ideas of death, of discouragement, were far away at this hour. He wanted to fight, at least to sell his life dearly. The idea of the struggle intoxicated him again. He dreamed of victory, of a happy life with Miette, in the great peace of the universal Republic.","All at once, however, they came out just in front of Orcheres. Loud cries of joy, the shouting of a crowd, sounded clearly in the limpid air. The insurrectionary forces were only now entering the town. Miette and Silvère went in with the stragglers. Never had they seen such enthusiasm. To judge from the streets, one would have thought it was a procession day, when the windows are decked with the finest drapery to honour the passage of the Canopy. The townsfolk welcomed the insurgents as though they were deliverers. The men embraced them, while the women brought them food. Old men were to be seen weeping at the doors. And the joyousness was of an essentially Southern character, pouring forth in clamorous fashion, in singing, dancing, and gesticulation. As Miette passed along she was carried away by a farandole[*] which spread whirling all round the Grand’ Place. Silvère followed her. His thoughts of death and his discouragement were now far away. He wanted to fight, to sell his life dearly at least. The idea of a struggle intoxicated him afresh. He dreamed of victory to be followed by a happy life with Miette, amidst the peacefulness of the universal Republic. [*] The farandole is the popular dance of Provence.","Suddenly they came out just in front of Orchères. Cries of joy, the shouting of a crowd, could be heard in the clear air. The insurrectionary forces were only now entering the town. Miette and Silvère went in with the stragglers. Never had they seen such enthusiasm. In every street you would have thought it was a procession day, when the windows are adorned with the finest curtains to honour the passage of the Canopy. * The townspeople welcomed the insurgents as if they had come to liberate them. The men embraced them, while the women brought them food. Old men could be seen weeping on their doorsteps. The rejoicing was expressed in a distinctively Midi-like way, with much noise, singing, dancing, and gesticulation. As Miette passed along she was carried away by a farandole* that whirled all round the town-square. Silvère followed her. His thoughts of death and his despondency were now far away. He wanted to fight, to sell his life dearly at least. The idea of the imminent battle sent him into ecstasy. He dreamed of victory to be followed by a happy life with Miette, amidst the peace and harmony of the universal Republic."
« À demain ! »,""" Until tomorrow ! »",And as he kissed his mother he exclaimed: “Till to-morrow then!”,‘Until tomorrow then!’
"Elle avait quinze ans, elle se faisait chatte, elle tourbillonnait, avec ses vols brusques de cigale ivre de lumière et de chaleur. Et Pierre, dans l’effusion de sa victoire, vida son cœur. Il n’omit pas un détail. Il expliqua même ses projets futurs, oubliant que, selon lui, les femmes n’étaient bonnes à rien, et que la sienne devait tout ignorer, s’il voulait rester le maître. Félicité, penchée, buvait ses paroles. Elle lui fit recommencer certaines parties du récit, disant qu’elle n’avait pas entendu ; en effet, la joie faisait un tel vacarme dans sa tête que, par moments, elle devenait comme sourde, l’esprit perdu en pleine jouissance. Quand Pierre raconta l’affaire de la mairie, elle fut prise de rires, elle changea trois fois de fauteuil, roulant les meubles, ne pouvant tenir en place. Après quarante années d’efforts continus, la fortune se laissait enfin prendre à la gorge. Elle en devenait folle, à ce point qu’elle oublia elle-même toute prudence.","She was fifteen years old, she made herself a cat, she swirled around, with the sudden flights of a cicada drunk on light and heat. And Peter, in the outpouring of his victory, emptied his heart. He didn't omit a detail. He even explained his future plans, forgetting that, according to him, women were good for nothing, and that his woman had to ignore everything, if he wanted to remain the master. Felicite, bent over, drank in her words. She made him repeat certain parts of the story, saying that she had not heard; indeed, joy made such a din in her head that, at times, she became as if deaf, her mind lost in full enjoyment. When Pierre told the story of the town hall, she was seized with laughter, she changed her chair three times, rolling the furniture, unable to sit still. After forty years of continuous effort, fortune finally let itself be taken by the throat. She was going so mad about it that she herself forgot all caution.","She felt fifteen years old again, and began to coax him and whirl round him like a grasshopper fascinated by the light and heat. And Pierre, in the effusion of his triumph, poured out his heart to her. He did not omit a single detail. He even explained his future projects, forgetting that, according to his theories, wives were good for nothing, and that his must be kept in complete ignorance of what went on if he wished to remain master. Félicité leant over him and drank in his words. She made him repeat certain parts of his story, declaring she had not heard; in fact, her delight bewildered her so much that at times she seemed quite deaf. When Pierre related the events at the Town Hall, she burst into a fit of laughter, changed her chair three times, and moved the furniture about, quite unable to sit still. After forty years of continuous struggle, fortune had at last yielded to them. Eventually she became so mad over it that she forgot all prudence.","She felt fifteen again, became quite coquettish, and began to whirl round him like a cicada attracted irresistibly to the light and heat. Pierre, carried away by his triumph, poured his heart out. He did not forget a single detail. He even explained his plans for the future, forgetting that, according to his way of thinking, wives were good for nothing and that his must be kept in complete ignorance of what went on if he wanted to remain in control. Félicité, leaning over him, drank in his words. She made him repeat certain parts of the story she said she had not heard ; she was so transported with excitement that she could hardly pay attention to what he was saying. When he described what had happened at the town hall she burst out laughing, sat on three different chairs, and moved the furniture about, quite unable to stay still. After forty years of unremitting struggle their luck had finally turned. She became so carried away that she threw all caution to the winds..."
"Rougon, resté seul, s’étonna de cette révolte d’un homme si humble, si plat d’ordinaire. La conduite de Vuillet lui parut louche. Mais il n’eut pas le temps de chercher une explication. Il s’était à peine allongé de nouveau dans son fauteuil, que Roudier entra, en faisant sonner terriblement, sur sa cuisse, un grand sabre qu’il avait attaché à sa ceinture. Les dormeurs se réveillèrent effarés. Granoux crut à un appel aux armes.","Rougon, left alone, was astonished at this revolt of so humble a man, usually so flat. Vuillet's behavior seemed suspicious to him. But he had no time to look for an explanation. He had scarcely stretched out again in his armchair when Roudier entered, clanking terribly on his thigh a large saber which he had fastened to his belt. The sleepers woke up terrified. Granoux believed in a call to arms.","Rougon, when he was alone again, felt amazed at this mutiny on the part of a man who was usually so meek and mild. Vuillet’s conduct seemed to him suspicious.

"Puis, il ajouta d’un air fin, en regardant sa femme dans les yeux :","Then he added shrewdly, looking his wife in the eye:",And with an air of shrewdness he looked into his wife’s eyes and added: “Would you be glad to be the wife of a receiver of taxes?”,"Then, assuming a sly look, he gazed into her eyes and said:"
"Il prononça ce mot de frères avec une emphase juvénile. Puis, s’animant, d’une voix plus vibrante :","He pronounced the word brothers with youthful emphasis. Then, becoming animated, in a more vibrant voice:","He spoke the word brothers with youthful emphasis. “A contest is becoming inevitable,” he added; “but, at any rate, we have right on our side, and we shall triumph.”","He said the word ‘brothers’ with youthful emphasis. ‘An uprising is becoming inevitable,’ he added; ‘but right is on our side, and we shall win.’"
"Dans les rues, il éprouva un malaise. La ville lui parut changée. Elle prenait un air singulier ; des ombres filaient rapidement le long des trottoirs, le vide et le silence se faisaient, et, sur les maisons mornes, semblait tomber, avec le crépuscule, une peur grise, lente et opiniâtre comme une pluie fine. La confiance bavarde de la journée aboutissait fatalement à cette panique sans cause, à cet effroi de la nuit naissante ; les habitants étaient las, rassasiés de leur triomphe, à ce point qu’il ne leur restait des forces que pour rêver des représailles terribles de la part des insurgés. Rougon frissonna dans ce courant d’effroi. Il hâta le pas, la gorge serrée. En passant devant un café de la place des Récollets, qui venait d’allumer ses lampes, et où se réunissaient les petits rentiers de la ville neuve, il entendit un bout de conversation très effrayant.","In the streets, he felt uneasy. The city seemed to him changed. She assumed a singular air; shadows slipped rapidly along the sidewalks, emptiness and silence were created, and on the gloomy houses seemed to fall, with the twilight, a gray fear, slow and obstinate like a fine rain. The talkative confidence of the day led inevitably to this causeless panic, to this dread of dawning night; the inhabitants were weary, satiated with their triumph, to such an extent that they only had strength left to dream of terrible reprisals from the insurgents. Rougon shivered in this current of dread. He quickened his pace, his throat tight. As he passed a cafe in the Place des Récollets, which had just lighted its lamps, and where the little rentiers of the new town were meeting, he overheard a very frightening bit of conversation.","When he reached the street, his disquietude increased. The town seemed to him quite altered. It was assuming a strange aspect; shadows were gliding along the footpaths, which were growing deserted and silent, while gloomy fear seemed, like fine rain, to be slowly, persistently falling with the dusk over the mournful-looking houses. The babbling confidence of the daytime was fatally terminating in groundless panic, in growing alarm as the night drew nearer; the inhabitants were so weary and so satiated with their triumph that they had no strength left but to dream of some terrible retaliation on the part of the insurgents. Rougon shuddered as he passed through this current of terror. He hastened his steps, feeling as if he would choke. As he passed a cafe on the Place des Récollets, where the lamps had just been lit, and where the petty cits of the new town were assembled, he heard a few words of terrifying conversation.","As he walked through the streets Rougon became increasingly anxious. The town seemed different. It was assuming a strange appearance; shadows were flitting along the footpaths, which were becoming deserted and silent, while an atmosphere of gloom and apprehension seemed to be falling, slowly and persistently, like fine rain over the mournful-looking houses. The confidence of the day was inexorably changing into groundless panic, into growing alarm as night-time approached; the townsfolk were so weary and so full of their triumph that they had no strength left except to dream of some terrible retaliation on the part of the insurgents. Rougon shuddered as he felt this current of terror. He quickened his pace, feeling his throat tighten. As he passed a café on the Place des Récollets, where the lamps had just been lit and where the rentiers from the new town had gathered, he overheard a few words that made his blood run cold."
"– Eh ! oui, je n’y comprends rien. Comme j’insistais, il est allé jusqu’à me reprocher de ne pas avoir tué tous les insurgés… C’était hier qu’il aurait dû écrire son article ; aujourd’hui, il va nous faire massacrer. »","– Hey! yes, I don't understand it. As I insisted, he went so far as to reproach me for not having killed all the insurgents… He should have written his article yesterday; today he is going to have us massacred. »","“Yes! yes! I can’t understand it at all. When I insisted, he went so far as to reproach me for not having killed all the insurgents. It was yesterday that he ought to have written that article; to-day he’ll get us all butchered!”","‘Yes, yes! I can’t understand it at all. When I insisted he went so far as to reproach me for not having killed all the insurgents. He should have written this article yesterday; today he’ll get us all butchered!’"
"Puis, se calmant, elle posa la tête sur l’épaule du jeune homme, elle garda le silence. Silvère se baissait et l’embrassait longuement. Elle goûtait ces baisers avec lenteur, en cherchait le sens, la saveur secrète. Elle les interrogeait, les écoutait courir dans ses veines, leur demandait s’ils étaient tout l’amour, toute la passion. Une langueur la prit, elle s’endormit doucement, sans cesser de goûter dans son sommeil les caresses de Silvère. Celui-ci l’avait enveloppée dans la grande pelisse rouge, dont il avait également ramené un pan sur lui. Ils ne sentaient plus le froid. Quand Silvère, à la respiration régulière de Miette, eut compris qu’elle sommeillait, il fut heureux de ce repos qui allait leur permettre de continuer gaillardement leur chemin. Il se promit de la laisser dormir une heure. Le ciel était toujours noir ; à peine, au levant, une ligne blanchâtre indiquait-elle l’approche du jour. Il devait y avoir, derrière les amants, un bois de pins, dont le jeune homme entendait le réveil musical, aux souffles de l’aube. Et les lamentations des cloches devenaient plus vibrantes dans l’air frissonnant, berçant le sommeil de Miette, comme elles avaient accompagné ses fièvres d’amoureuse.","Then, calming down, she laid her head on the young man's shoulder, she remained silent. Silvere bent down and kissed her for a long time. She tasted these kisses slowly, seeking their meaning, their secret flavor. She questioned them, listened to them running through her veins, asked them if they were all love, all passion. A languor seized her, she fell asleep gently, without ceasing to taste Silvere's caresses in her sleep. He had wrapped her in the big red cloak, part of which he had also brought over him. They no longer felt the cold. When Silvere, from Miette's regular breathing, understood that she was dozing, he was happy with this rest which was going to allow them to continue merrily on their way. He promised himself to let her sleep for an hour. The sky was still dark; scarcely, at the east, did a whitish line indicate the approach of day. There must have been, behind the lovers, a pine wood, whose musical awakening the young man could hear, in the breaths of dawn. And the lamentations of the bells became more vibrant in the quivering air, rocking Miette's sleep, as they had accompanied her amorous fevers.","At last, growing calmer, she gently rested her head on the young man’s shoulder, without uttering a word. Silvère kissed her again. She tasted those kisses slowly, seeking their meaning, their hidden sweetness. As she felt them course through her veins, she interrogated them, asking if they were all love, all passion. But languor at last overcame her, and she fell into gentle slumber. Silvère had enveloped her in her pelisse, drawing the skirt around himself at the same time. They no longer felt cold. The young man rejoiced to find, from the regularity of her breathing, that the girl was now asleep; this repose would enable them to proceed on their way with spirit. He resolved to let her slumber for an hour. The sky was still black, and the approach of day was but faintly indicated by a whitish line in the east. Behind the lovers there must have been a pine wood whose musical awakening it was that the young man heard amidst the morning breezes. And meantime the wailing of the bells grew more sonorous in the quivering atmosphere, lulling Miette’s slumber even as it had accompanied her passionate fever.","At last, growing calmer, she gently rested her head on the young man’s shoulder and fell silent. Silvère, leaning forward, gave her long, lingering kisses. She tasted the kisses slowly, seeking their meaning, their hidden savour. As she felt them coursing through her veins she questioned them, wondering if they were all love, all passion. But exhaustion finally overcame her, and she fell gently asleep, still feeling Silvère’s kisses as she slept. He had wrapped her in her great red pelisse, drawing one of its folds round himself as well. They no longer felt the cold. The young man was pleased to realize, from the regularity of Miette’s breathing, that she was now asleep; this rest would enable them to continue on their way with renewed energy. He decided to let her sleep for an hour. The sky was still black, and the approach of day was barely indicated by a whitish line on the horizon. Behind them there must have been a pinewood, whose musical awakening the young man could hear amidst the dawn breezes. In the meantime the melancholy sound of the bells grew louder, lulling Miette in her sleep just as it had accompanied her passionate excitement."
"Cette insulte alla frapper Félicité au cœur. L’ingratitude de ce peuple la navrait, car elle finissait elle-même par croire à la mission des Rougon. Elle appela son mari ; elle voulut qu’il prît une leçon sur l’instabilité des foules.","This insult struck Felicite to the heart. The ingratitude of this people distressed her, for she herself ended up believing in the mission of the Rougons. She called her husband; she wanted him to take a lesson in the instability of crowds.","This insult pierced Félicité to the heart. The ingratitude of the people was heartrending to her, for she herself was at last beginning to believe in the mission of the Rougons. She called for her husband. She wanted him to learn how fickle was the multitude.","This insult cut Félicité to the quick. The ingratitude of these people upset her, for she herself was at last beginning to believe in the mission of the Rougons. She called her husband over.

"Rougon, qui n’avait pas de plan arrêté à son égard, le poussa dans un cabinet de toilette où M. Garçonnet venait se reposer parfois. Ce cabinet, éclairé par en haut, n’avait d’autre issue que la porte d’entrée. Il était meublé de quelques fauteuils, d’un divan et d’un lavabo de marbre. Pierre ferma la porte à double tour, après avoir délié à moitié les mains de son frère. On entendit ce dernier se jeter sur le divan, et il entonna le Ça ira ! d’une voix formidable, comme pour se bercer.","Rougon, who had no fixed plan for him, pushed him into a dressing room where Monsieur Garçonnet sometimes came to rest. This study, lit from above, had no other exit than the front door. It was furnished with a few armchairs, a divan, and a marble sink. Pierre double-locked the door, after half untying his brother's hands. We heard the latter throw himself on the couch, and he intoned the Ça ira! in a formidable voice, as if to rock.","Thereupon Rougon, who had formed no definite plan with regard to him, thrust him into a dressing-room whither Monsieur Garconnet retired to rest sometimes. This room lighted from above, had no other means of exit than the doorway by which one entered. It was furnished with a few arm-chairs, a sofa, and a marble wash-stand. Pierre double-locked the door, after partially unbinding his brother’s hands. Macquart was then heard to throw himself on the sofa, and start singing the “Ça Ira” in a loud voice, as though he were trying to sing himself to sleep.","Rougon, who was unsure what to do with his brother, pushed him into a dressing-room where Monsieur Garçonnet retired to rest sometimes. This room, lit from above, had no way out other than the door. It contained a few armchairs, a sofa, and a marble washstand. Pierre double-locked the door, after loosening the bands round his brother’s wrists. Macquart was then heard throwing himself on the sofa, and starting to intone the Ça ira * in a very loud voice, as if trying to sing himself to sleep."
"Plus tard, dès les premières pièces de vingt sous que Jean et Gervaise lui rapportèrent, il trouva que les enfants avaient du bon. Lisa n’était déjà plus là. Il se fit nourrir par les deux qui restaient sans le moindre scrupule, comme il se faisait déjà nourrir par leur mère. Ce fut, de sa part, une spéculation très arrêtée. Dès l’âge de huit ans, la petite Gervaise alla casser des amandes chez un négociant voisin ; elle gagnait dix sous par jour, que le père mettait royalement dans sa poche, sans que Fine elle-même osât demander où cet argent passait. Puis, la jeune fille entra en apprentissage chez une blanchisseuse, et, quand elle fut ouvrière et qu’elle toucha deux francs par jour, les deux francs s’égarèrent de la même façon entre les mains de Macquart. Jean, qui avait appris l’état de menuisier, était également dépouillé les jours de paye, lorsque Macquart parvenait à l’arrêter au passage, avant qu’il eût remis son argent à sa mère. Si cet argent lui échappait, ce qui arrivait quelquefois, il était d’une terrible maussaderie. Pendant une semaine, il regardait ses enfants et sa femme d’un air furieux, leur cherchant querelle pour un rien, mais ayant encore la pudeur de ne pas avouer la cause de son irritation. À la paye suivante, il faisait le guet et disparaissait des journées entières, dès qu’il avait réussi à escamoter le gain des petits.","Later, from the first twenty-sou pieces that Jean and Gervaise brought him, he found that the children had some good. Lisa was already gone. He was fed by the two who remained without the slightest scruple, as he was already being fed by their mother. It was, on his part, a very fixed speculation. From the age of eight, little Gervaise went to break almonds at a neighboring merchant; she earned ten sous a day, which her father put royally into his pocket, without Fine herself daring to ask where the money went. Then the young girl entered an apprenticeship with a laundress, and when she was a worker and received two francs a day, the two francs lost their way in the same way into Macquart's hands. Jean, who had learned to be a carpenter, was also robbed on paydays, when Macquart managed to stop him on the way, before he had given his money to his mother. If the money got away from him, which sometimes happened, he was terribly surly. For a week he looked furiously at his children and his wife, seeking to quarrel with them over nothing, but still having the modesty not to confess the cause of his irritation. At the next payday, he would keep watch and disappear for days on end, as soon as he had managed to evade the little ones' winnings.","Later on, however, as soon as Jean and Gervaise earned their first francs, he found some good in children after all. Lisa was no longer there. He lived upon the earnings of the two others without compunction, as he had already lived upon their mother. It was a well-planned speculation on his part. As soon as little Gervaise was eight years old, she went to a neighbouring dealer’s to crack almonds; she there earned ten sous a day, which her father pocketed right royally, without even a question from Fine as to what became of the money. The young girl was next apprenticed to a laundress, and as soon as she received two francs a day for her work, the two francs strayed in a similar manner into Macquart’s hands. Jean, who had learnt the trade of a carpenter, was likewise despoiled on pay-days, whenever Macquart succeeded in catching him before he had handed the money to his mother. If the money escaped Macquart, which sometimes happened, he became frightfully surly. He would glare at his wife and children for a whole week, picking a quarrel for nothing, although he was, as yet, ashamed to confess the real cause of his irritations. On the next pay-day, however, he would station himself on the watch, and as soon as he had succeeded in pilfering the youngster’s earnings, he disappeared for days together.","Later on, however, as soon as Jean and Gervaise began to bring home the first coins they earned, he found some good in the children after all. Lisa had already left. He had no scruples in living on the earnings of the other two, as he had lived on their mother. It was a carefully planned form of speculation. As soon as little Gervaise was eight, she went to a neighbouring dealer’s to crack almonds; she earned ten sous a day, which her father pocketed magisterially, without Fine daring ever to ask him what he did with the money. The young girl was then apprenticed to a laundress, and as soon as she received two francs a day for her work, the two francs found their way in the same manner into Macquart’s pocket. Jean, who had learned a trade as a carpenter, was similarly stripped of his money on paydays, whenever Macquart managed to catch him before he had handed his wages to his mother. If the money eluded him, which sometimes happened, he became terribly surly. He would glare at his wife and children for a whole week, picking a quarrel for no reason, but not having the gall to declare the real cause of his annoyance. On the next payday he would keep watch and, as soon as he had managed to pilfer the youngsters’ earnings, would disappear for days at a time."
"Ils passèrent deux jours encore à Orchères, le mardi et le mercredi, perdant le temps, aggravant leur situation. Le général, l’homme au sabre, que Silvère avait montré à Miette sur la route de Plassans, hésitait, pliait sous la terrible responsabilité qui pesait sur lui. Le jeudi, il jugea que décidément la position d’Orchères était dangereuse. Vers une heure, il donna l’ordre du départ, il conduisit sa petite armée sur les hauteurs de Sainte-Roure. C’était là, d’ailleurs, une position inexpugnable, pour qui aurait su la défendre. Sainte-Roure étage ses maisons sur le flanc d’une colline ; derrière la ville, d’énormes blocs de rochers ferment l’horizon ; on ne peut monter à cette sorte de citadelle que par la plaine des Nores, qui s’élargit au bas du plateau. Une esplanade, dont on a fait un cours, planté d’ormes superbes, domine la plaine. Ce fut sur cette esplanade que les insurgés campèrent. Les otages eurent pour prison une auberge, l’hôtel de la Mule-Blanche, située au milieu du cours. La nuit se passa lourde et noire. On parla de trahison. Dès le matin, l’homme au sabre, qui avait négligé de prendre les plus simples précautions, passa une revue. Les contingents étaient alignés, tournant le dos à la plaine, avec le tohu-bohu étrange des costumes, vestes brunes, paletots foncés, blouses bleues, serrées par des ceintures rouges ; les armes, bizarrement mêlées, luisaient au soleil clair, les faux aiguisées de frais, les larges pelles de terrassier, les canons brunis des fusils de chasse : lorsque, au moment où le général improvisé passait à cheval devant la petite armée, une sentinelle, qu’on avait oubliée dans un champ d’oliviers, accourut en gesticulant, en criant :","They spent two more days at Orcheres, Tuesday and Wednesday, wasting time, aggravating their situation. The general, the man with the sabre, whom Silvere had shown to Miette on the road to Plassans, hesitated, gave way under the terrible responsibility which weighed on him. On Thursday, he decided that the position of Orchères was definitely dangerous. About one o'clock he gave the order to depart, he led his little army to the heights of Sainte-Roure. This was, moreover, an impregnable position for anyone who knew how to defend it. Sainte-Roure stages its houses on the side of a hill; behind the city, huge blocks of rock close the horizon; one can only climb to this kind of citadel by way of the plain of the Nores, which widens out at the bottom of the plateau. An esplanade, of which we have made a course, planted with superb elms, dominates the plain. It was on this esplanade that the insurgents encamped. The hostages were kept in an inn, the Hôtel de la Mule-Blanche, located in the middle of the course. The night passed heavy and dark. We talked about betrayal. Early in the morning, the man with the sword, who had neglected to take the simplest precautions, passed a review. The contingents were lined up, with their backs to the plain, with the strange hustle and bustle of suits, brown jackets, dark overcoats, blue blouses, tightened by red belts; the weapons, strangely mixed, gleamed in the bright sun, the freshly sharpened scythes, the large navvies' shovels, the burnished barrels of the shotguns: when, at the moment when the improvised general passed on horseback in front of the small army, a sentry, who had been forgotten in a field of olive trees, ran up, gesticulating, shouting:","They spent two more days at Orcheres, Tuesday and Wednesday, thus losing time and aggravating the situation. The general, the man with the sabre, whom Silvère had pointed out to Miette on the Plassans road, vacillated and hesitated under the terrible responsibility that weighed upon him. On Thursday he came to the conclusion that the position of Orcheres was a decidedly dangerous one; so towards one o’clock he gave orders to march, and led his little army to the heights of Sainte-Roure. That was, indeed, an impregnable position for any one who knew how to defend it. The houses of Sainte-Roure rise in tiers along a hill-side; behind the town all approach is shut off by enormous rocks, so that this kind of citadel can only be reached by the Nores plain, which spreads out at the foot of the plateau. An esplanade, converted into a public walk planted with magnificent elms, overlooks the plain. It was on this esplanade that the insurgents encamped. The hostages were imprisoned in the Hôtel de la Mule-Blanche, standing half-way along the promenade. The night passed away heavy and black. The insurgents spoke of treachery. As soon as it was morning, however, the man with the sabre, who had neglected to take the simplest precautions, reviewed the troops. The contingents were drawn up in line with their backs turned to the plain. They presented a wonderful medley of costume, some wearing brown jackets, others dark greatcoats, and others again blue blouses girded with red sashes. Moreover, their arms were an equally odd collection: there were newly sharpened scythes, large navvies’ spades, and fowling-pieces with burnished barrels glittering in the sunshine. And at the very moment when the improvised general was riding past the little army, a sentry, who had been forgotten in an olive-plantation, ran up gesticulating and shouting:","They spent two more days at Orchères, Tuesday and Wednesday, thus losing time and aggravating the situation.

"Elle n’était point de nature rêveuse, elle jouissait par tout son corps, par tous ses sens, du ciel, de la rivière, des ombres, des clartés. La rivière surtout, cette eau, ce terrain mouvant, la portait avec des caresses infinies. Elle éprouvait, quand elle remontait le courant, une grande jouissance à sentir le flot filer plus rapide contre sa poitrine et contre ses jambes ; c’était un long chatouillement, très doux, qu’elle pouvait supporter sans rire nerveux. Elle s’enfonçait davantage, se mettait de l’eau jusqu’aux lèvres, pour que le courant passât sur ses épaules, l’enveloppât d’un trait, du menton aux pieds, de son baiser fuyant. Elle avait des langueurs qui la laissaient immobile à la surface, tandis que de petits flots glissaient mollement entre son costume et sa peau, gonflant l’étoffe ; puis elle se roulait dans les nappes mortes, ainsi qu’une chatte sur un tapis ; et elle allait de l’eau lumineuse, où se baignait la lune, dans l’eau noire, assombrie par les feuillages, avec des frissons, comme si elle eût quitté une plaine ensoleillée et senti le froid des branches lui tomber sur la nuque.","She was not of a dreamy nature, she enjoyed with her whole body, with all her senses, the sky, the river, the shadows, the lights. The river above all, this water, this moving terrain, carried her with infinite caresses. She experienced, when she ascended the current, a great pleasure in feeling the wave slipping faster against her chest and against her legs; it was a long, very gentle tickle that she could bear without giggling. She sank deeper, pouring water up to her lips, so that the current would pass over her shoulders, wrap her in a stroke, from chin to feet, in her fleeting kiss. She had languor which left her motionless on the surface, while little waves slipped softly between her costume and her skin, swelling the stuff; then she rolled around in the dead tablecloths, like a cat on a rug; and she went from the luminous water, where the moon bathed, into the black water, darkened by the foliage, with shivers, as if she had left a sunny plain and felt the cold of the branches fall on her neck.","She was not of a dreamy nature; it was physically, through the medium of each of her senses, that she derived enjoyment from the sky, the river, and the play of light and shadow. The river, in particular, bore her along with endless caresses. When she swam against the current she was delighted to feel the stream flow rapidly against her bosom and limbs. She dipped herself in it yet more deeply, with the water reaching to her lips, so that it might pass over her shoulders, and envelop her, from chin to feet, with flying kisses. Then she would float, languid and quiescent, on the surface, whilst the ripples glided softly between her costume and her skin. And she would also roll over in the still pools like a cat on a carpet; and swim from the luminous patches where the moonbeams were bathing, to the dark water shaded by the foliage, shivering the while, as though she had quitted a sunny plain and then felt the cold from the boughs falling on her neck.","She was not dreamy by nature; it was physically, through all her senses, that she enjoyed the sky, the river, and the play of light and shadow.

"Félicité se perdait en plein étonnement. Quelle mouche avait donc piqué Vuillet ? L’image de ce bedeau manqué, un fusil à la main, faisant le coup de feu sur les remparts de Plassans, lui semblait une des choses les plus bouffonnes qu’on pût imaginer.

"Le salon, ce noyau de conservateurs appartenant à tous les partis, et qui grossissait journellement, eut bientôt une grande influence. Par la diversité de ses membres, et surtout grâce à l’impulsion secrète que chacun d’eux recevait du clergé, il devint le centre réactionnaire qui rayonna sur Plassans entier. La tactique du marquis, qui s’effaçait, fit regarder Rougon comme le chef de la bande. Les réunions avaient lieu chez lui, cela suffisait aux yeux peu clairvoyants du plus grand nombre pour le mettre à la tête du groupe et le désigner à l’attention publique. On lui attribua toute la besogne ; on le crut le principal ouvrier de ce mouvement qui, peu à peu, ramenait au parti conservateur les républicains enthousiastes de la veille. Il est certaines situations dont bénéficient seuls les gens tarés. Ils fondent leur fortune là où des hommes mieux posés et plus influents n’auraient point osé risquer la leur. Certes, Roudier, Granoux et les autres, par leur position d’hommes riches et respectés, semblaient devoir être mille fois préférés à Pierre comme chefs actifs du parti conservateur. Mais aucun d’eux n’aurait consenti à faire de son salon un centre politique ; leurs convictions n’allaient pas jusqu’à se compromettre ouvertement ; en somme, ce n’étaient que des braillards, des commères de province, qui voulaient bien cancaner chez un voisin contre la République, du moment où le voisin endossait la responsabilité de leurs cancans. La partie était trop chanceuse. Il n’y avait pour la jouer, dans la bourgeoisie de Plassans, que les Rougon, ces grands appétits inassouvis et poussés aux résolutions extrêmes.","The salon, that nucleus of conservatives belonging to all parties, and which increased daily, soon had a great influence. By the diversity of its members, and above all thanks to the secret impulse that each of them received from the clergy, it became the reactionary center which shone over the whole of Plassans. The tactics of the marquis, which was in the background, caused Rougon to be regarded as the leader of the band. The meetings took place at his house, that was enough for the unsightly eyes of the greatest number to put him at the head of the group and point him out to public attention. All the work was assigned to him; he was believed to be the chief laborer of this movement which, little by little, was bringing the enthusiastic Republicans of the previous day back to the Conservative party. There are certain situations that only crazy people benefit from. They found their fortune where better-placed and more influential men would not have dared to risk theirs. Certainly, Roudier, Granoux and the others, by their position as rich and respected men, seemed likely to be a thousand times preferred to Pierre as active leaders of the Conservative party. But none of them would have consented to make his living room a political center; their convictions did not go so far as to compromise themselves openly; in short, they were only brawlers, provincial gossips, who wanted to gossip at a neighbor's house against the Republic, as long as the neighbor took responsibility for their gossip. The game was too lucky. There were only the Rougons to play it, among the bourgeoisie of Plassans, those great unsatisfied appetites driven to extreme resolutions.","The drawing-room, that little band of Conservatives belonging to all parties, and daily increasing in numbers, soon wielded powerful influence. Owing to the diversified characters of its members, and especially to the secret impulse which each one received from the clergy, it became the centre of the reactionary movement and spread its influence throughout Plassans. The policy of the marquis, who sank his own personality, transformed Rougon into the leader of the party. The meetings were held at his house, and this circumstance sufficed in the eyes of most people to make him the head of the group, and draw public attention to him. The whole work was attributed to him; he was believed to be the chief artisan of the movement which was gradually bringing over to the Conservative party those who had lately been enthusiastic Republicans. There are some situations which benefit only persons of bad repute. These lay the foundations of their fortune where men of better position and more influence would never dare to risk theirs. Roudier, Granoux, and the others, all men of means and respectability, certainly seemed a thousand times preferable to Pierre as the acting leaders of the Conservative party. But none of them would have consented to turn his drawing-room into a political centre. Their convictions did not go so far as to induce them to compromise themselves openly; in fact, they were only so many provincial babblers, who liked to inveigh against the Republic at a neighbour’s house as long as the neighbour was willing to bear the responsibility of their chatter. The game was too risky. There was no one among the middle classes of Plassans who cared to play it except the Rougons, whose ungratified longings urged them on to extreme measures.","The drawing-room, that little band of conservatives of all stripes, growing daily in numbers, soon wielded a great deal of influence. Because of the diverse nature of its members, and especially because of the secret power exerted over them by the clergy, it became the centre of the reactionary movement, whose presence began to be felt throughout Plassans. The policy of the Marquis, who deliberately faded into the background, turned Rougon into the movement’s leader. Their meetings were held at his house, and this was enough for most people to see him as the head of the group and to draw public attention to him. He was given all the credit; he was thought to be the one responsible for the movement that was gradually winning over to the conservative side those who had lately been enthusiasts of the Republic. There are some situations that benefit only corrupt individuals. These people lay the foundations of their fortune where more sober and more influential men would never dare to risk theirs. Roudier, Granoux, and the others, all men of means and respectability, certainly seemed infinitely preferable to Pierre as leaders of the conservative party. But none of them would have agreed to turn their drawing-room into a political meeting-place. Their convictions were not so great that they would compromise themselves openly; in fact, they were little more than provincial loudmouths, who liked to denigrate the Republic at a neighbour’s house as long as the neighbour was willing to take responsibility for what they said. The game was too risky. There was no one among the bourgeoisie of Plassans who would play it except the Rougons, whose unsatisfied appetites drove them to extreme measures."
"Sa haine s’accrut encore, lorsque les Rougon eurent groupé les conservateurs autour d’eux, et qu’ils prirent, à Plassans, une certaine influence. Le fameux salon jaune devint, dans ses bavardages ineptes de café, une caverne de bandits, une réunion de scélérats qui juraient chaque soir sur des poignards d’égorger le peuple. Pour exciter contre Pierre les affamés, il alla jusqu’à faire courir le bruit que l’ancien marchand d’huile n’était pas aussi pauvre qu’il le disait, et qu’il cachait ses trésors par avarice et par crainte des voleurs. Sa tactique tendit ainsi à ameuter les pauvres gens, en leur contant des histoires à dormir debout, auxquelles il finissait souvent par croire lui-même. Il cachait assez mal ses rancunes personnelles et ses désirs de vengeance sous le voile du patriotisme le plus pur ; mais il se multipliait tellement, il avait une voix si tonnante, que personne n’aurait alors osé douter de ses convictions.","His hatred increased still more when the Rougons had grouped the conservatives around them, and when they gained a certain influence at Plassans. The famous yellow drawing-room became, in its inane cafe gossip, a den of bandits, a gathering of scoundrels who swore each evening on daggers to cut the throats of the people. To stir up the hungry against Peter, he went so far as to spread the rumor that the former oil merchant was not as poor as he said he was, and that he hid his treasures out of avarice and fear of thieves. . His tactics thus tended to arouse the poor people, by telling them bedtime stories, which he often ended up believing himself. He hid his personal grudges and his desires for revenge rather badly under the veil of the purest patriotism; but he multiplied so much, he had such a thundering voice, that no one would then have dared to doubt his convictions.","His hatred further increased when the Rougons had gathered the Conservatives round them, and thus acquired a certain influence in Plassans. The famous yellow drawing-room became, in his hare-brained chatter at the cafe, a cave of bandits, an assembly of villains who every evening swore on their daggers that they would murder the people. In order to incite the starvelings against Pierre, Macquart went so far as to circulate a report that the retired oil-dealer was not so poor as he pretended, but that he concealed his treasures through avarice and fear of robbery. His tactics thus tended to rouse the poor people by a repetition of absurdly ridiculous tales, which he often came to believe in himself. His personal animosity and his desire for revenge were ill concealed beneath his professions of patriotism; but he was heard so frequently, and he had such a loud voice, that no one would have dared to doubt the genuineness of his convictions.","His hatred increased even further when the Rougons had gathered all the conservatives around them, and thus acquired a certain influence in Plassans. The famous yellow drawing-room became, in his wild talk at the café, a bandits’ hideaway, a gathering of crooks who every evening swore on their daggers that they would cut the people’s throats. To incite his starving audience against Pierre, he went so far as to spread the rumour that the retired oil-dealer was not as poor as he pretended, but hid his fortune like a miser afraid of being robbed. His tactic was thus to rouse the workers by telling them tall stories, which he often began to believe himself. His professions of pure patriotism could not hide his jealousy and his desire for revenge; but he was so vociferous that no one would have dared to doubt his sincerity."
« Et toi ? demanda-t-elle à son tour.,""" And you ? she asked in turn.","Again she raised herself slightly, and in a clear voice inquired in her turn: “And yours?”","‘What’s yours?’ ‘Silvère,’ he replied."
"Le jeune ménage se mit bravement à la conquête de la fortune. La maison Puech et Lacamp se trouvait moins compromise que Pierre ne le pensait. Le chiffre des dettes était faible, l’argent seul manquait. En province, le commerce a des allures prudentes qui le sauvent des grands désastres. Les Puech et Lacamp étaient sages parmi les plus sages ; ils risquaient un millier d’écus en tremblant ; aussi leur maison, un véritable trou, n’avait-elle que très peu d’importance. Les cinquante mille francs que Pierre apporta suffirent pour payer les dettes et pour donner au commerce une plus large extension. Les commencements furent heureux. Pendant trois années consécutives, la récolte des oliviers donna abondamment. Félicité, par un coup d’audace qui effraya singulièrement Pierre et le vieux Puech, leur fit acheter une quantité considérable d’huile qu’ils amassèrent et gardèrent en magasin. Les deux années suivantes, selon les pressentiments de la jeune femme, la récolte manqua, il y eut une hausse considérable, ce qui leur permit de réaliser de gros bénéfices en écoulant leur provision.","The young couple set out bravely to conquer fortune. The Puech and Lacamp house was less compromised than Pierre thought. The number of debts was low, only money was missing. In the provinces, commerce has a cautious gait which saves it from great disasters. The Puechs and Lacamps were wise among the wisest; they risked a thousand crowns by trembling; so their house, a veritable hole, was of very little importance. The fifty thousand francs which Pierre brought sufficed to pay the debts and to give the trade a wider extension. The beginnings were happy. For three consecutive years, the harvest of the olive trees yielded abundantly. Félicité, by a stroke of audacity which singularly frightened Pierre and old Puech, made them buy a considerable quantity of oil which they amassed and kept in store. The following two years, according to the presentiments of the young woman, the harvest failed, there was a considerable increase, which allowed them to make large profits by selling off their supply.","The young couple bravely sought to conquer fortune. The firm of Puech & Lacamp was not, after all, so embarrassed as Pierre had thought. Its liabilities were small, it was merely in want of ready-money. In the provinces, traders adopt prudent courses to save them from serious disasters. Puech & Lacamp were prudent to an excessive degree; they never risked a thousand crowns without the greatest fear, and thus their house, a veritable hole, was an unimportant one. The fifty thousand francs that Pierre brought into it sufficed to pay the debts and extend the business. The beginnings were good. During three successive years the olive harvest was an abundant one. Félicité, by a bold stroke which absolutely frightened both Pierre and old Puech, made them purchase a considerable quantity of oil, which they stored in their warehouse. During the following years, as the young woman had foreseen, the crops failed, and a considerable rise in prices having set in, they realised large profits by selling out their stock.","The young couple resolved to make their fortune. The firm of Puesch & Lacamp was not, after all, as badly off as Pierre had thought. Its liabilities were limited, it was simply in need of ready cash. In the provinces, traders adopt prudent practices in order to protect themselves from real disasters. Puesch & Lacamp took prudence to extremes; they never risked a thousand crowns without the greatest apprehension, and so their firm never grew. The fifty thousand francs that Pierre brought with him were enough to pay the debts and extend the business. The early days were very good. For three years in a row, the olive harvest was excellent. Félicité, by a bold stroke which gave both Pierre and old Puesch a terrible fright, made them purchase a large quantity of oil, which they stored in their warehouse. The next two harvests, as the young woman had foreseen, were poor, prices rose sharply, and they made big profits by selling off their stock."
"Cependant, il finit lui-même par confesser que l’attitude d’Antoine devenait intolérable. Un jour, Félicité, voulant en finir, appela cet homme, comme elle le nommait en faisant une moue dédaigneuse. « Cet homme » était en train de la traiter de coquine au milieu de la rue, en compagnie d’un sien camarade encore plus déguenillé que lui. Tous deux étaient gris.","However, he himself ended up confessing that Antoine's attitude was becoming intolerable. One day, Felicite, wanting to get it over with, called this man, as she called him, making a disdainful pout. “This man” was calling her a rascal in the middle of the street, in the company of his friend who was even more ragged than him. Both were gray.","He confessed, however, at last that Antoine’s demeanour was becoming intolerable. One day, Félicité, desiring to put an end to it, called to “that man,” as she styled him with a disdainful curl on her lip. “That man” was in the act of calling her a foul name in the middle of the street, where he stood with one of his friends, even more ragged than himself.

They were both drunk."
"Et, chemin faisant, il se fit conter le cas. Le jardin se terminait par une terrasse qui dominait la plaine ; en cet endroit, un large pan des remparts s’était écroulé, l’horizon s’étendait sans bornes. Rougon avait compris que ce serait là un excellent poste d’observation. Les gardes nationaux étaient restés à la porte. Tout en causant, les membres de la commission vinrent s’accouder sur le parapet de la terrasse. L’étrange spectacle qui se déroula alors devant eux les rendit muets. Au loin, dans la vallée de la Viorne, dans ce creux immense qui s’enfonçait, au couchant, entre la chaîne des Garrigues et les montagnes de la Seille, les lueurs de la lune coulaient comme un fleuve de lumière pâle. Les bouquets d’arbres, les rochers sombres faisaient, de place en place, des îlots, des langues de terre, émergeant de la mer lumineuse. Et l’on distinguait, selon les coudes de la Viorne, des bouts, des tronçons de rivière, qui se montraient, avec des reflets d’armures, dans la fine poussière d’argent qui tombait du ciel. C’était un océan, un monde, que la nuit, le froid, la peur secrète, élargissaient à l’infini. Ces messieurs n’entendirent, ne virent d’abord rien. Il y avait dans le ciel un frisson de lumière et de voix lointaines qui les assourdissait et les aveuglait. Granoux, peu poète de sa nature, murmura cependant, gagné par la paix sereine de cette nuit d’hiver :","And, on the way, he had the case told to him. The garden ended in a terrace which overlooked the plain; in this place, a large section of the ramparts had collapsed, the horizon stretched without limits. Rougon understood that this would be an excellent observation post. The National Guardsmen remained at the gate. While chatting, the members of the commission leaned on the parapet of the terrace. The strange spectacle which then unfolded before them rendered them dumb. In the distance, in the valley of the Viorne, in this immense hollow which sank, at sunset, between the chain of the Garrigues and the mountains of the Seille, the gleams of the moon flowed like a river of pale light. The clumps of trees, the dark rocks made, from place to place, islets, tongues of land, emerging from the luminous sea. And one could distinguish, along the bends of the Viorne, ends, sections of the river, which showed themselves, with reflections of armor, in the fine silver dust which fell from the sky. It was an ocean, a world, which the night, the cold, the secret fear, enlarged to infinity. These gentlemen heard and saw nothing at first. There was a quiver of light and distant voices in the sky that deafened and blinded them. Granoux, not very poetic by nature, however, murmured, won over by the serene peace of this winter night:","On the way thither he ascertained what their object was. At the end of the garden rose a terrace which overlooked the plain. A large portion of the ramparts had there tumbled in, leaving a boundless prospect to the view. It had occurred to Rougon that this would serve as an excellent post of observation. While conversing together the members of the Commission leaned over the parapet. The strange spectacle that spread out before them soon made them silent. In the distance, in the valley of the Viorne, across the vast hollow which stretched westward between the chain of the Garrigues and the mountains of the Seille, the rays of the moon were streaming like a river of pale light. The clumps of trees, the gloomy rocks, looked, here and there, like islets and tongues of land, emerging from a luminous sea; and, according to the bends of the Viorne one could now and again distinguish detached portions of the river, glittering like armour amidst the fine silvery dust falling from the firmament. It all looked like an ocean, a world, magnified by the darkness, the cold, and their own secret fears. At first the gentlemen could neither hear nor see anything. The quiver of light and of distant sound blinded their eyes and confused their ears. Granoux, though he was not naturally poetic, was struck by the calm serenity of that winter night, and murmured: “What a beautiful night, gentlemen!”","On the way he ascertained the purpose of the visit. At the end of the garden there was a terrace that overlooked the plain; a large section of the ramparts had collapsed at that point, giving an unimpeded view. It had occurred to Rougon that this would serve as an excellent observation post. As they chatted the members of the council leaned over the parapet. The strange spectacle they saw spread out before them reduced them to silence. In the distance, in the valley of the Viorne, across the vast hollow that stretched westwards between the chain of the Garrigues and the mountains of the Seille, the moonlight was streaming down like a river of pale light. The clumps of trees and the dark rocks looked, here and there, like islets and tongues of land emerging from a luminous sea. And, corresponding to the bends of the Viorne, it was possible to see patches and slithers of the river, glittering like armour amidst the fine silvery dust that fell from the sky. It all looked like an ocean, a whole world, magnified by the darkness, the cold, and their own secret fears. At first these gentlemen could neither hear nor see anything.

"L’histoire politique de Plassans, ainsi que celle de toutes les petites villes de la Provence, offre une curieuse particularité. Jusqu’en 1830, les habitants restèrent catholiques pratiquants et fervents royalistes ; le peuple lui-même ne jurait que par Dieu et que par ses rois légitimes. Puis un étrange revirement eut lieu ; la foi s’en alla, la population ouvrière et bourgeoise, désertant la cause de la légitimité, se donna peu à peu au grand mouvement démocratique de notre époque. Lorsque la révolution de 1848 éclata, la noblesse et le clergé se trouvèrent seuls à travailler au triomphe d’Henri V. Longtemps, ils avaient regardé l’avènement des Orléans comme un essai ridicule qui ramènerait tôt ou tard les Bourbons ; bien que leurs espérances fussent singulièrement ébranlées, ils n’en engagèrent pas moins la lutte, scandalisés par la défection de leurs anciens fidèles et s’efforçant de les ramener à eux. Le quartier Saint-Marc, aidé de toutes les paroisses, se mit à l’œuvre. Dans la bourgeoisie, dans le peuple surtout, l’enthousiasme fut grand au lendemain des journées de février ; ces apprentis républicains avaient hâte de dépenser leur fièvre révolutionnaire. Mais pour les rentiers de la ville neuve, ce beau feu eut l’éclat et la durée d’un feu de paille. Les petits propriétaires, les commerçants retirés, ceux qui avaient dormi leurs grasses matinées ou arrondi leur fortune sous la monarchie, furent bientôt pris de panique ; la République, avec sa vie de secousses, les fit trembler pour leur caisse et pour leur chère existence d’égoïstes. Aussi, lorsque la réaction cléricale de 1849 se déclara, presque toute la bourgeoisie de Plassans passa-t-elle au parti conservateur. Elle y fut reçue à bras ouverts. Jamais la ville neuve n’avait eu des rapports si étroits avec le quartier Saint-Marc ; certains nobles allèrent jusqu’à toucher la main à des avoués et à d’anciens marchands d’huile. Cette familiarité inespérée enthousiasma le nouveau quartier, qui fit, dès lors, une guerre acharnée au gouvernement républicain. Pour amener un pareil rapprochement, le clergé dut dépenser des trésors d’habileté et de patience. Au fond, la noblesse de Plassans se trouvait plongée, comme une moribonde, dans une prostration invincible ; elle gardait sa foi, mais elle était prise du sommeil de la terre, elle préférait ne pas agir, laisser faire le ciel ; volontiers, elle aurait protesté par son silence seul, sentant vaguement peut-être que ses dieux étaient morts et qu’elle n’avait plus qu’à aller les rejoindre. Même à cette époque de bouleversement, lorsque la catastrophe de 1848 put lui faire espérer un instant le retour des Bourbons, elle se montra engourdie, indifférente, parlant de se jeter dans la mêlée et ne quittant qu’à regret le coin de son feu. Le clergé combattit sans relâche ce sentiment d’impuissance et de résignation. Il y mit une sorte de passion. Un prêtre, lorsqu’il désespère, n’en lutte que plus âprement ; toute la politique de l’Église est d’aller droit devant elle, quand même, remettant la réussite de ses projets à plusieurs siècles, s’il est nécessaire, mais ne perdant pas une heure, se poussant toujours en avant, d’un effort continu. Ce fut donc le clergé qui, à Plassans, mena la réaction. La noblesse devint son prête-nom, rien de plus ; il se cacha derrière elle, il la gourmanda, la dirigea, parvint même à lui rendre une vie factice. Quand il l’eut amenée à vaincre ses répugnances au point de faire cause commune avec la bourgeoisie, il se crut certain de la victoire. Le terrain était merveilleusement préparé ; cette ancienne ville royaliste, cette population de bourgeois paisibles et de commerçants poltrons devait fatalement se ranger tôt ou tard dans le parti de l’ordre. Le clergé, avec sa tactique savante, hâta la conversion. Après avoir gagné les propriétaires de la ville neuve, il sut même convaincre les petits détaillants du vieux quartier. Dès lors, la réaction fut maîtresse de la ville. Toutes les opinions étaient représentées dans cette réaction ; jamais on ne vit un pareil mélange de libéraux tournés à l’aigre, de légitimistes, d’orléanistes, de bonapartistes, de cléricaux. Mais peu importait, à cette heure. Il s’agissait uniquement de tuer la République. Et la République agonisait. Une fraction du peuple, un millier d’ouvriers au plus, sur les dix mille âmes de la ville, saluaient encore l’arbre de la liberté, planté au milieu de la place de la Sous-Préfecture.","The political history of Plassans, as well as that of all the small towns of Provence, offers a curious particularity. Until 1830, the inhabitants remained practicing Catholics and fervent royalists; the people themselves swore only by God and by their legitimate kings. Then a strange reversal took place; faith went away, the working class and bourgeois population, deserting the cause of legitimacy, gave themselves little by little to the great democratic movement of our time. When the revolution of 1848 broke out, the nobility and the clergy found themselves alone working for the triumph of Henri V. For a long time, they had regarded the accession of the Orleans as a ridiculous attempt which would sooner or later bring back the Bourbons; although their hopes were singularly shaken, they nevertheless engaged in the struggle, scandalized by the defection of their former faithful and striving to bring them back to themselves. The Saint-Marc district, helped by all the parishes, set to work. Among the bourgeoisie, especially among the people, enthusiasm was great on the morrow of the February days; these republican apprentices were in a hurry to spend their revolutionary fever. But for the tenants of the new town, this beautiful fire had the brilliance and the duration of a straw fire. The small proprietors, the retired merchants, those who had slept their fat mornings or augmented their fortunes under the monarchy, were soon seized with panic; the Republic, with its shocking life, made them tremble for their cash and for their cherished selfish existence. Also, when the clerical reaction of 1849 declared itself, almost all the bourgeoisie of Plassans passed to the conservative party. She was received there with open arms. Never had the new town had such close ties with the Saint-Marc district; some nobles went so far as to touch hands with solicitors and former oil merchants. This unexpected familiarity excited the new district, which from then on made a bitter war against the Republican government. To bring about such a rapprochement, the clergy had to expend treasures of skill and patience. Basically, the nobility of Plassans found itself plunged, like a dying person, into an invincible prostration; she kept her faith, but she was taken by the slumber of the earth, she preferred not to act, leaving heaven to do its thing; willingly, she would have protested by her silence alone, perhaps feeling vaguely that her gods were dead and that she had only to go and join them. Even in this period of upheaval, when the catastrophe of 1848 could give her hope for a moment of the return of the Bourbons, she showed herself numb, indifferent, talking of throwing herself into the fray and only reluctantly leaving the corner of her fire. The clergy fought relentlessly against this feeling of powerlessness and resignation. He put a kind of passion into it. A priest, when he despairs, struggles all the more bitterly; the whole policy of the Church is to go straight ahead, all the same, postponing the success of its projects for several centuries, if necessary, but not wasting an hour, always pushing forward, continuous effort. It was therefore the clergy who, at Plassans, led the reaction. The nobility became his nominee, nothing more; he hid behind her, he berated her, directed her, even managed to give her a fake life. When he had brought her to overcome her repugnance to the point of making common cause with the bourgeoisie, he believed himself certain of victory. The ground was marvelously prepared; this former royalist city, this population of peaceful bourgeois and cowardly merchants was inevitably bound sooner or later to side with order. The clergy, with their skilful tactics, hastened the conversion. After winning over the owners of the new town, he even managed to convince small retailers in the old quarter. From then on, the reaction was master of the city. All opinions were represented in this reaction; never did one see such a mixture of liberals turned sour, legitimists, orleanists, bonapartists, clericals. But it didn't matter at this hour. It was all about killing the Republic. And the Republic was dying. A fraction of the people, a thousand workmen at the most, out of the ten thousand souls of the city, still saluted the tree of liberty, planted in the middle of the square of the Sub-Prefecture.","The political history of Plassans, like that of all little towns in Provence, is singularly characteristic. Until 1830, the inhabitants remained observant Catholics and fervent royalists; even the lower classes only swore by God and their legitimate sovereigns. Then there came a sudden change; faith departed, the working and middle classes deserted the cause of legitimacy, and gradually espoused the great democratic movement of our time. When the Revolution of 1848 broke out, the nobility and the clergy were left alone to labour for the triumph of Henri V. For a long time they had regarded the accession of the Orleanists as a ridiculous experiment, which sooner or later would bring back the Bourbons; although their hopes were singularly shaken, they nevertheless continued the struggle, scandalised by the defection of their former allies, whom they strove to win back to their cause. The Saint-Marc quarter, assisted by all the parish priests, set to work. Among the middle classes, and especially among the people, the enthusiasm was very great on the morrow of the events of February; these apprentice republicans were in haste to display their revolutionary fervour. As regards the gentry of the new town, however, the conflagration, bright though it was, lasted no longer than a fire of straw. The small houseowners and retired tradespeople who had had their good days, or had made snug little fortunes under the monarchy, were soon seized with panic; the Republic, with its constant shocks and convulsions, made them tremble for their money and their life of selfishness. Consequently, when the Clerical reaction of 1849 declared itself, nearly all the middle classes passed over to the Conservative party. They were received with open arms. The new town had never before had such close relations with the Saint-Marc quarter: some of the nobility even went so far as to shake hands with lawyers and retired oil-dealers. This unexpected familiarity kindled the enthusiasm of the new quarter, which henceforward waged bitter warfare against the republican government. To bring about such a coalition, the clergy had to display marvellous skill and endurance. The nobility of Plassans for the most part lay prostrate, as if half dead. They retained their faith, but lethargy had fallen on them, and they preferred to remain inactive, allowing the heavens to work their will. They would gladly have contented themselves with silent protest, feeling, perhaps, a vague presentiment that their divinities were dead, and that there was nothing left for them to do but rejoin them. Even at this period of confusion, when the catastrophe of 1848 was calculated to give them a momentary hope of the return of the Bourbons, they showed themselves spiritless and indifferent, speaking of rushing into the melee, yet never quitting their hearths without a pang of regret. The clergy battled indefatigably against this feeling of impotence and resignation. They infused a kind of passion into their work: a priest, when he despairs, struggles all the more fiercely. The fundamental policy of the Church is to march straight forward; even though she may have to postpone the accomplishment of her projects for several centuries, she never wastes a single hour, but is always pushing forward with increasing energy. So it was the clergy who led the reaction of Plassans; the nobility only lent them their name, nothing more. The priests hid themselves behind the nobles, restrained them, directed them, and even succeeded in endowing them with a semblance of life. When they had induced them to overcome their repugnance so far as to make common cause with the middle classes, they believed themselves certain of victory. The ground was marvellously well prepared. This ancient royalist town, with its population of peaceful householders and timorous tradespeople, was destined to range itself, sooner or later, on the side of law and order. The clergy, by their tactics, hastened the conversion. After gaining the landlords of the new town to their side, they even succeeded in convincing the little retail-dealers of the old quarter. From that time the reactionary movement obtained complete possession of the town. All opinions were represented in this reaction; such a mixture of embittered Liberals, Legitimists, Orleanists, Bonapartists, and Clericals had never before been seen. It mattered little, however, at that time. The sole object was to kill the Republic; and the Republic was at the point of death. Only a fraction of the people—a thousand workmen at most, out of the ten thousand souls in the town—still saluted the tree of liberty planted in the middle of the square in front of the Sub-Prefecture.","The political history of Plassans, like that of all the little towns in Provence, has an interesting characteristic.

"Mais ces courtes phrases ne faisaient que fouetter la verve de Rougon. Il répondait à tout le monde. Il mimait l’action. Ce gros homme, dans l’admiration de ses propres exploits, retrouvait des souplesses d’écolier, il revenait, se répétait, au milieu des paroles croisées, des cris de surprise, des conversations particulières qui s’établissaient brusquement pour la discussion d’un détail ; et il allait ainsi en s’agrandissant, emporté par un souffle épique. D’ailleurs, Granoux et Roudier étaient là qui lui soufflaient des faits, de petits faits imperceptibles qu’il omettait. Ils brûlaient, eux aussi, de placer un mot, de conter un épisode, et parfois ils lui volaient la parole. Ou bien ils parlaient tous les trois ensemble. Mais lorsque, pour garder comme dénouement, comme bouquet, l’épisode homérique de la glace cassée, Rougon voulut dire ce qui s’était passé en bas dans la cour, lors de l’arrestation du poste, Roudier l’accusa de nuire au récit en changeant l’ordre des événements. Et ils se disputèrent un instant avec quelque aigreur. Puis Roudier, voyant l’occasion bonne pour lui, s’écria d’une voix prompte :","But these short sentences only whipped up Rougon's verve. He responded to everyone. He mimicked the action. This fat man, in admiration of his own exploits, rediscovered the suppleness of a schoolboy, he came back, repeated to himself, in the midst of the crossed words, the cries of surprise, the particular conversations which were suddenly established for the discussion of a detail ; and so it went on growing, carried away by an epic blast. Moreover, Granoux and Roudier were there, whispering facts to him, little imperceptible facts that he omitted. They, too, burned to put in a word, to recount an episode, and sometimes they stole his word. Or the three of them were talking together. But when, to keep as a denouement, as a bouquet, the Homeric episode of the broken mirror, Rougon wanted to say what had happened downstairs in the courtyard, during the arrest of the post, Roudier accused him of harming the narrative by changing the order of events. And they argued for a moment with some bitterness. Then Roudier, seeing the opportunity good for him, exclaimed in a prompt voice:","These remarks and questions only incited Rougon’s imagination the more. He replied to everybody. He mimicked the action. This stout man, in his admiration of his own achievements, became as nimble as a schoolboy; he began afresh, repeated himself, amidst the exclamations of surprise and individual discussions which suddenly arose about some trifling detail. And thus he continued blowing his trumpet, making himself more and more important as if some irresistible force impelled him to turn his narrative into a genuine epic. Moreover Granoux and Roudier stood by his side prompting him, reminding him of such trifling matters as he omitted. They also were burning to put in a word, and occasionally they could not restrain themselves, so that all three went on talking together. When, in order to keep the episode of the broken mirror for the dénouement, like some crowning glory, Rougon began to describe what had taken place downstairs in the courtyard, after the arrest of the guard, Roudier accused him of spoiling the narrative by changing the sequence of events. For a moment they wrangled about it somewhat sharply. Then Roudier, seeing a good opportunity for himself, suddenly exclaimed: “","This flurry of comments and questions inflamed Rougon’s imagination even more. He answered everybody. He mimicked the action. This portly man, in his admiration of his own achievements, became as nimble as a schoolboy; he began afresh and repeated himself amidst the overlapping remarks, exclamations of surprise, and private conversations suddenly provoked by some trifling detail; and he carried on blowing his trumpet, making himself more and more important, as if impelled to turn his narrative into a full-blown epic. Granoux and Roudier stood by his side prompting him, reminding him of whatever trifling matters he omitted. They, too, were dying to speak, to recount an episode, and occasionally they took over the storytelling. At other times all three spoke at once. When, in order to keep the episode of the broken mirror for the denouement, like some crowning glory, Rougon began to describe what had taken place downstairs in the courtyard, after the arrest of the Guardsman, Roudier accused him of spoiling the narrative by changing the sequence of events.

"Les circonstances le servirent singulièrement. Il échappa à la conscription, à titre de fils aîné d’une femme veuve. Mais, deux ans plus tard, Antoine tomba au sort. Sa mauvaise chance le toucha peu ; il comptait que sa mère lui achèterait un homme. Adélaïde, en effet, voulut le sauver du service. Pierre, qui tenait l’argent, fit la sourde oreille. Le départ forcé de son frère était un heureux événement servant trop bien ses projets. Quand sa mère lui parla de cette affaire, il la regarda d’une telle façon qu’elle n’osa même pas achever. Son regard disait : « Vous voulez donc me ruiner pour votre bâtard ? » Elle abandonna Antoine, égoïstement, ayant avant tout besoin de paix et de liberté. Pierre, qui n’était pas pour les moyens violents, et qui se réjouissait de pouvoir mettre son frère à la porte sans querelle, joua alors le rôle d’un homme désespéré : l’année avait été mauvaise, l’argent manquait à la maison, il faudrait vendre un coin de terre, ce qui était le commencement de la ruine. Puis il donna sa parole à Antoine qu’il le rachèterait l’année suivante, bien décidé à n’en rien faire. Antoine partit, dupé, à demi content.","Circumstances served him singularly. He escaped conscription as the eldest son of a widowed woman. But, two years later, Antoine fell by lot. His bad luck affected him little; he counted on his mother buying him a man. Adelaide, in fact, wanted to save him from service. Pierre, who was holding the money, turned a deaf ear. The forced departure of his brother was a happy event serving his plans too well. When his mother told him about this affair, he looked at her in such a way that she did not even dare to finish. His look said: ""So you want to ruin me for your bastard?"" She abandoned Antoine, selfishly, needing above all peace and freedom. Pierre, who was not for violent means, and who was delighted to be able to kick his brother out without a fight, then played the role of a desperate man: the year had been bad, the money was short house, it would be necessary to sell a piece of land, which was the beginning of the ruin. Then he gave his word to Antoine that he would buy it back the following year, determined not to do so. Antoine left, duped, half-satisfied.","Circumstances proved singularly favourable. He escaped the conscription on the ground of being a widow’s eldest son. But two years later Antoine was called out. His bad luck did not affect him much; he counted on his mother purchasing a substitute for him. Adélaïde, in fact, wished to save him from serving; Pierre, however, who held the money, turned a deaf ear to her. His brother’s compulsory departure would be a lucky event for him, and greatly assist the accomplishment of his plans. When his mother mentioned the matter to him, he gave her such a look that she did not venture to pursue it. His glance plainly signified, “Do you wish, then, to ruin me for the sake of your illegitimate offspring?” Forthwith she selfishly abandoned Antoine, for before everything else she sought her own peace and quietness. Pierre, who did not like violent measures, and who rejoiced at being able to eject his brother without a disturbance, then played the part of a man in despair: the year had been a bad one, money was scarce, and to raise any he would be compelled to sell a portion of the land, which would be the beginning of their ruin. Then he pledged his word of honour to Antoine that he would buy him out the following year, though he meant to do nothing of the kind. Antoine then went off, duped, and half satisfied.","Circumstances proved singularly favourable. He escaped conscription on the ground of being a widow’s eldest son. But two years later Antoine’s name was called out. His bad luck did not bother him much; he counted on his mother buying a proxy. * Adélaïde wanted to save him from serving; but Pierre, who held the purse-strings, turned a deaf ear. His brother’s enforced departure was a stroke of luck that would help him to realize his plans. When his mother raised the matter, he gave her such a look that she did not dare to take it any further. His glance plainly signified: ‘Do you want to ruin me for the sake of your bastard child?’ Without hesitating she selfishly abandoned Antoine, for above all else she was concerned for her own peace and quiet. Pierre, who did not like violent measures, and rejoiced at being able to eject his brother without a fuss, then played the part of a man in despair; it had been a bad year, the household budget was very tight, and to raise any money he would have to sell a portion of the land, which would be the beginning of their ruin. Then he gave his word of honour to Antoine that he would buy him out the following year, though he meant to do nothing of the kind. Antoine went off, duped and half-satisfied."
"Deux jours avant son retour à Paris, Eugène rencontra sur le cours Sauvaire son frère Aristide, qui l’accompagna quelques instants, avec l’insistance d’un homme en quête d’un conseil. Aristide était dans une grande perplexité. Dès la proclamation de la République, il avait affiché le plus vif enthousiasme pour le gouvernement nouveau. Son intelligence, assouplie par ses deux années de séjour à Paris, voyait plus loin que les cerveaux épais de Plassans ; il devinait l’impuissance des légitimistes et des orléanistes, sans distinguer avec netteté quel serait le troisième larron qui viendrait voler la République. À tout hasard, il s’était mis du côté des vainqueurs. Il avait rompu tout rapport avec son père, le qualifiant en public de vieux fou, de vieil imbécile enjôlé par la noblesse.","Two days before his return to Paris, Eugene met his brother Aristide on the Cours Sauvaire, who accompanied him for a few moments, with the insistence of a man seeking advice. Aristide was in great perplexity. From the proclamation of the Republic, he had displayed the liveliest enthusiasm for the new government. His intelligence, softened by his two years of residence in Paris, saw farther than the thick brains of Plassans; he divined the impotence of the Legitimists and the Orleanists, without clearly distinguishing which would be the third thief who would come to rob the Republic. On the off chance that he was on the side of the winners. He had broken off all contact with his father, calling him in public an old fool, an old imbecile beguiled by the nobility.","Two days before his return to Paris, Eugène met his brother Aristide, on the Cours Sauvaire, and the latter accompanied him for a short distance with the importunity of a man in search of advice. As a matter of fact, Aristide was in great perplexity. Ever since the proclamation of the Republic, he had manifested the most lively enthusiasm for the new government. His intelligence, sharpened by two years’ stay at Paris, enabled him to see farther than the thick heads of Plassans. He divined the powerlessness of the Legitimists and Orleanists, without clearly distinguishing, however, what third thief would come and juggle the Republic away. At all hazard he had ranged himself on the side of the victors, and he had severed his connection with his father, whom he publicly denounced as an old fool, an old dolt whom the nobility had bamboozled.","Two days before his return to Paris, Eugène met his brother Aristide on the Cours Sauvaire, and the latter walked with him for a few minutes looking like a man in search of advice. Aristide was, in fact, in a state of some confusion. Ever since the proclamation of the Republic he had expressed the greatest enthusiasm for the new government. His intelligence, sharpened by the two years he had spent in Paris, enabled him to see things more clearly than the rather dim folk of Plassans; he could sense the impotence of the Legitimists and Orleanists, but could not see what third thief would come and steal the Republic. He had aligned himself with the victors, and severed his connection with his father, whom he publicly denounced as an old fool whom the nobility had tricked into supporting them."

"« Voici les hommes de Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx, reprit Silvère. Ce bourg s’est soulevé presque en même temps que la Palud… les patrons se sont joints aux ouvriers. Il y a là des gens riches, Miette ; des riches qui pourraient vivre tranquilles chez eux et qui vont risquer leur vie pour la défense de la liberté.

Ce sont les chefs. »","""Here are the men of Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx,"" resumed Silvere. This town rose up almost at the same time as La Palud… the bosses joined the workers.

They are the leaders. »","“Those are the men of Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx,” Silvère resumed. “That bourg rose almost at the same time as La Palud. The masters joined the workmen. There are some rich men there, Miette; men whose wealth would enable them to live peacefully at home, but who prefer to risk their lives in defence of liberty. One can but admire them.

They are the leaders.”","‘Those are the men from Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx,’ Silvère resumed. ‘That bourg rose up almost at the same time as La Palud... The bosses joined the workers.

"Et, chez les Rougon, le soir, au dessert, des rires montaient dans la buée de la table, toute chaude encore des débris du dîner. Enfin, ils mordaient aux plaisirs des riches ! Leurs appétits, aiguisés par trente ans de désirs contenus, montraient des dents féroces. Ces grands inassouvis, ces fauves maigres, à peine lâchés de la veille dans les jouissances, acclamaient l’Empire naissant, le règne de la curée ardente. Comme il avait relevé la fortune des Bonaparte, le coup d’État fondait la fortune des Rougon.","And, at the Rougons, in the evening, at dessert, laughter rose in the mist from the table, still warm from the remains of the dinner. Finally, they bit into the pleasures of the rich! Their appetites, sharpened by thirty years of restrained desires, showed fierce teeth.

As it had raised the fortunes of the Bonapartes, the coup d'etat founded the fortunes of the Rougons.","And in the evening at dessert, at the Rougons’ abode, bursts of laughter arose with the fumes from the table, which was still warm with the remains of the dinner. At last the Rougons were nibbling at the pleasures of the wealthy! Their appetites, sharpened by thirty years of restrained desire, now fell to with wolfish teeth. These fierce, insatiate wild beasts, scarcely entering upon indulgence, exulted at the birth of the Empire—the dawn of the Rush for the Spoils. The Coup d’État, which retrieved the fortune of the Bonapartes, also laid the foundation for that of the Rougons.","That evening, in the Rougons’ apartment at dessert, gales of laughter rose from the table, which was still warm with the remains of the dinner.

"Miette ne se défendait plus. C’était elle, maintenant, qui collait sa bouche sur celle de Silvère, qui cherchait avec une muette ardeur cette joie dont elle n’avait pu d’abord supporter l’amère cuisson. Le rêve d’une mort prochaine l’avait enfiévrée ; elle ne se sentait plus rougir, elle s’attachait à son amant, elle semblait vouloir épuiser, avant de se coucher dans la terre, ces voluptés nouvelles, dans lesquelles elle venait à peine de tremper les lèvres, et dont elle s’irritait de ne pas pénétrer sur-le-champ tout le poignant inconnu. Au-delà du baiser, elle devinait autre chose qui l’épouvantait et l’attirait, dans le vertige de ses sens éveillés. Et elle s’abandonnait ; elle eût supplié Silvère de déchirer le voile, avec l’impudique naïveté des vierges. Lui, fou de la caresse qu’elle lui donnait, empli d’un bonheur parfait, sans force, sans autres désirs, ne paraissait pas même croire à des voluptés plus grandes.","Miette no longer defended herself. It was she, now, who pressed her mouth to Silvere's, who sought with mute ardor that joy whose bitter burning she had at first been unable to bear. The dream of approaching death had made her feverish; she no longer felt herself blushing, she attached herself to her lover, she seemed to want to exhaust, before lying down in the ground, these new pleasures, in which she had just dipped her lips, and which she was irritated to not to immediately penetrate all the poignant unknown. Beyond the kiss, she guessed something else that terrified and attracted her, in the vertigo of her awakened senses. And she abandoned herself; she would have begged Silvere to tear the veil, with the shameless simplicity of virgins. He, mad at the caress she gave him, filled with perfect happiness, without strength, without other desires, did not even seem to believe in greater pleasures.","Miette no longer turned away. It was she, now, who pressed her lips to Silvère’s, who sought with mute ardour for the delight whose stinging smart she had not at first been able to endure.","Miette resisted no longer. It was she now who pressed her lips to Silvère’s, passionately seeking the pleasure whose burning sensation she had not at first been able to bear. The thought of impending death had excited her; she no longer felt herself blushing but clung to her sweetheart, seeming, before being buried in the earth, to want to exhaust the newly discovered pleasures which her lips had only just begun to taste, and which she was frustrated not to be able to enjoy immediately in all their unknown delights. Beyond their kisses she divined something else which alarmed and attracted her, in the dizziness of her tingling senses. She let herself go; she would have begged Silvère, with the innocent shamelessness of a virgin, to tear down the veil. He, maddened by her caresses, transported, seemed unable even to imagine any greater pleasure."

"Comme il sortait de l’impasse Saint-Mittre, hésitant, se demandant s’il n’était pas dangereux de solliciter du préfet la grâce de Silvère, il vit Aristide qui rôdait autour du champ de poutres. Ce dernier, ayant reconnu son père, accourut, la mine inquiète, et lui dit quelques mots à l’oreille. Pierre devint blême ; il jeta un regard effaré au fond de l’aire, dans ces ténèbres qu’un feu de bohémiens tachait seul d’une clarté rouge. Et tous deux disparurent par la rue de Rome, hâtant le pas, comme s’ils avaient tué, et relevant le collet de leur paletot, pour ne pas être vus.","As he came out of the Impasse Saint-Mittre, hesitating, wondering if it were not dangerous to beg the prefect for Silvere's pardon, he saw Aristide prowling around the field of beams.

Pierre turned pale; he cast a bewildered glance at the far end of the threshing-floor, into that darkness which only the fire of the gypsies stained with a red light.

Pierre turned pale, and cast a look of alarm towards the end of the yard, where the darkness was only relieved by the ruddy glow of a little gipsy fire.

"La grand-mère était venue par hasard au puits. En apercevant, dans la vieille muraille noire, la trouée blanche de la porte que Silvère avait ouverte toute grande, elle reçut au cœur un coup violent. Cette trouée blanche lui semblait un abîme de lumière creusé brutalement dans son passé.

Elle se pendait à son cou, elle restait sur sa poitrine, tandis que le soleil levant, entrant avec elle dans la cour par la porte qu’elle ne prenait pas le temps de refermer, les baignait de ses rayons obliques. Vision brusque qui la tirait cruellement du sommeil de sa vieillesse, comme un châtiment suprême, en réveillant en elle les cuissons brûlantes du souvenir.

"Quand le jeune homme sentit sa mère en sa possession, qu’il put la traiter en esclave, il commença à exploiter dans son intérêt les faiblesses de son cerveau et la terreur folle qu’un seul de ses regards lui inspirait. Son premier soin, dès qu’il fut maître au logis, fut de congédier le maraîcher, et de le remplacer par une créature à lui. Il prit la haute direction de la maison, vendant, achetant, tenant la caisse. Il ne chercha, d’ailleurs, ni à régler la conduite d’Adélaïde ni à corriger Antoine et Ursule de leur paresse. Peu lui importait, car il comptait se débarrasser de ces gens à la première occasion. Il se contenta de leur mesurer le pain et l’eau. Puis, ayant déjà toute la fortune dans les mains, il attendit un événement qui lui permît d’en disposer à son gré.","When the young man felt his mother in his possession, that he could treat her as a slave, he began to exploit in his interest the weaknesses of his brain and the mad terror that a single look of her inspired in him.

He took over the top management of the house, selling, buying, keeping the cash register. He made no attempt, however, either to regulate Adelaide's conduct or to correct Antoine and Ursule for their laziness. It didn't matter to him, because he intended to get rid of these people at the first opportunity. He contented himself with measuring out the bread and water for them. Then, having already the whole fortune in his hands, he waited for an event which would enable him to dispose of it as he pleased.","When the young man felt that his mother was in his power, that he could treat her like a slave, he began, in his own interest, to turn her cerebral weakness and the foolish terror with which his glances inspired her to his own advantage.

Then he took upon himself the supreme direction of the household, selling, buying, and holding the cash-box.

"Silvère, en reconnaissant cette tête, seule au ras du mur, cet immonde galopin, la face blême et ravie, les cheveux légèrement dressés sur le front, éprouva une rage sourde, un besoin de vivre. Ce fut la dernière révolte de son sang, une rébellion d’une seconde. Il retomba à genoux, il regarda devant lui. Dans le crépuscule mélancolique, une vision suprême passa.

"Quant à Pierre Rougon, il avait pris du ventre ; il était devenu un très respectable bourgeois, auquel il ne manquait que de grosses rentes pour paraître tout à fait digne. Sa face empâtée et blafarde, sa lourdeur, son air assoupi, semblaient suer l’argent. Il avait entendu dire un jour à un paysan qui ne le connaissait pas : « C’est quelque richard, ce gros-là ; allez, il n’est pas inquiet de son dîner ! » réflexion qui l’avait frappé au cœur, car il regardait comme une atroce moquerie d’être resté un pauvre diable, tout en prenant la graisse et la gravité satisfaite d’un millionnaire. Lorsqu’il se rasait, le dimanche, devant un petit miroir de cinq sous pendu à l’espagnolette d’une fenêtre, il se disait que, en habit et en cravate blanche, il ferait, chez M. le Sous-Préfet, meilleure figure que tel ou tel fonctionnaire de Plassans. Ce fils de paysan, blêmi dans les soucis du commerce, gras de vie sédentaire, cachant ses appétits haineux sous la placidité naturelle de ses traits, avait en effet l’air nul et solennel, la carrure imbécile qui pose un homme dans un salon officiel. On prétendait que sa femme le menait à la baguette, et l’on se trompait. Il était d’un entêtement de brute ; devant une volonté étrangère, nettement formulée, il se serait emporté grossièrement jusqu’à battre les gens. Mais Félicité était trop souple pour le contrecarrer ; la nature vive, papillonnante de cette naine n’avait pas pour tactique de se heurter de front aux obstacles ; quand elle voulait obtenir quelque chose de son mari ou le pousser dans la voie qu’elle croyait la meilleure, elle l’entourait de ses vols brusques de cigale, le piquait de tous les côtés, revenait cent fois à la charge, jusqu’à ce qu’il cédât, sans trop s’en apercevoir lui-même. Il la sentait, d’ailleurs, plus intelligente que lui et supportait assez patiemment ses conseils. Félicité, plus utile que la mouche du coche, faisait parfois toute la besogne en bourdonnant aux oreilles de Pierre. Chose rare, les époux ne se jetaient presque jamais leurs insuccès à la tête. La question de l’instruction des enfants déchaînait seule des tempêtes dans le ménage.","As for Pierre Rougon, he had gained belly; he had become a very respectable bourgeois, who needed only a large income to appear completely worthy. His thick, pale face, his heaviness, his drowsy air, seemed to sweat money. He had heard one day say to a peasant who did not know him: “He is some rich man, that fat fellow; Come on, he's not worried about his dinner! a reflection which had struck him to the heart, for he regarded it as an atrocious mockery to have remained a poor devil, while assuming the fat and self-satisfied gravity of a millionaire. When he shaved on Sundays, in front of a small five-sou mirror hung from the latch of a window, he said to himself that, in a suit and white tie, he would do better at the Sub-Prefect's. figure that this or that official of Plassans. This peasant's son, pale in the cares of business, fat from a sedentary life, hiding his hateful appetites under the natural placidity of his features, had in fact a solemn and solemn air, the imbecile build that poses a man in an official salon. . It was claimed that his wife was leading him on, and they were wrong. He was brutally stubborn; in front of a foreign will, clearly formulated, he would have gotten into a rude rage so far as to beat people. But Felicite was too flexible to thwart him; the lively, fluttering nature of this dwarf had no tactic of colliding head-on with obstacles; when she wanted to obtain something from her husband or push him down the path she believed to be best, she surrounded him with her sudden cicada flights, stung him on all sides, came back a hundred times to the charge, until what he yielded, without realizing it himself. He felt her, moreover, to be more intelligent than himself, and bore her advice rather patiently. Felicite, more useful than the busybody, sometimes did all the work, buzzing in Pierre's ears. A rare thing, the spouses almost never threw their failures at each other's heads. The question of the education of the children alone unleashed storms in the household.","As for Pierre Rougon, he had grown corpulent, and had become a highly respectable looking citizen, who only lacked a decent income to make him a very dignified individual. His pale, flabby face, his heaviness, his languid manner, seemed redolent of wealth. He had one day heard a peasant who did not know him say: “ Ah! he’s some rich fellow, that fat old gentleman there. He’s no cause to worry about his dinner!” This was a remark which stung him to the heart, for he considered it cruel mockery to be only a poor devil while possessing the bulk and contented gravity of a millionaire. When he shaved on Sundays in front of a small five-sou looking-glass hanging from the fastening of a window, he would often think that in a dress coat and white tie he would cut a far better figure at the Sub-Prefect’s than such or such a functionary of Plassans. This peasant’s son, who had grown sallow from business worries, and corpulent from a sedentary life, whose hateful passions were hidden beneath naturally placid features, really had that air of solemn imbecility which gives a man a position in an official salon. People imagined that his wife held a rod over him, but they were mistaken. He was as self-willed as a brute. Any determined expression of extraneous will would drive him into a violent rage. Félicité was far too supple to thwart him openly; with her light fluttering nature she did not attack obstacles in front. When she wished to obtain something from her husband, or drive him the way she thought best, she would buzz round him in her grasshopper fashion, stinging him on all sides, and returning to the charge a hundred times until he yielded almost unconsciously. He felt, moreover, that she was shrewder than he, and tolerated her advice fairly patiently. Félicité, more useful than the coach fly, would sometimes do all the work while she was thus buzzing round Pierre’s ears. Strange to say, the husband and wife never accused each other of their ill-success. The only bone of contention between them was the education lavished on their children.","As for Pierre, he had grown quite portly, and had become a highly respectable bourgeois. All he lacked, to enable him to play the role in full, was a good income. His pale, flabby face, his heaviness, his ponderous manner, seemed redolent of wealth. One day he had heard a peasant, who had no idea who he was, say: ‘He’s some rich character, that fat old gentleman over there. He won’t have to worry about his dinner!’ This remark cut him to the quick, for he found it cruelly ironic that he remained poor while possessing the corpulence and self-satisfied look of a millionaire. When he shaved on Sundays in front of a small five-sou looking-glass hanging from a window-catch, he would often think that in a dress coat and white tie he would cut a far better figure at the sub-prefect’s than many of the functionaries in the town. This peasant’s son, who had become sallow from his business worries, and fat from his sedentary life, and whose appetites and ambitions were hidden beneath naturally placid features, really had that air of nullity and gravity that gives a man a position in an official salon. People said that his wife led him by the nose, but they were mistaken. He was as stubborn as a mule. Anyone who tried to bend him to their will would drive him into a rage. Félicité was far too subtle to cross him openly; with her light, fluttering nature, she did not attack obstacles directly. When she wanted to get something from her husband, or push him in the direction she thought best, she would buzz round him in her cicada-like fashion, stinging him on all sides, and returning to the attack a hundred times until he gave in almost unconsciously. He felt, moreover, that she was more intelligent than him, and was usually happy to take her advice. Félicité, more effective than the coach-fly,* would sometimes get what she wanted by buzzing round Pierre’s ears. Strange to say, the husband and wife never blamed each other for their lack of success. The only bone of contention between them was the money they had spent on the education of their children."

"Cependant les événements marchaient. L’année 1851 fut, pour les politiques de Plassans, une année d’anxiété et d’effarement dont la cause secrète des Rougon profita. Les nouvelles les plus contradictoires arrivaient de Paris ; tantôt les républicains l’emportaient, tantôt le parti conservateur écrasait la République. L’écho des querelles qui déchiraient l’Assemblée législative parvenait au fond de la province, grossi un jour, affaibli le lendemain, changé au point que les plus clairvoyants marchaient en pleine nuit. Le seul sentiment général était qu’un dénouement approchait. Et c’était l’ignorance de ce dénouement qui tenait dans une inquiétude ahurie ce peuple de bourgeois poltrons. Tous souhaitaient d’en finir. Ils étaient malades d’incertitude, ils se seraient jetés dans les bras du Grand Turc, si le Grand Turc eût daigné sauver la France de l’anarchie.","However, events were marching on. The year 1851 was, for the politicians of Plassans, a year of anxiety and bewilderment from which the secret cause of the Rougons profited.

The echo of the quarrels which were tearing the Legislative Assembly to pieces reached the depths of the province, swollen one day, weakened the next, changed to such an extent that the most far-sighted were marching in the middle of the night. The only general feeling was that a denouement was approaching. And it was ignorance of this denouement that kept this people of cowardly bourgeois in bewildered anxiety. Everyone wanted to end it. They were sick with uncertainty, they would have thrown themselves into the arms of the Grand Turk, if the Grand Turk had deigned to save France from anarchy.","In the meantime, events were moving.

The most contradictory news arrived from Paris; sometimes the Republicans were in the ascendant, sometimes the Conservative party was crushing the Republic. The echoes of the squabbles which were rending the Legislative Assembly reached the depths of the provinces, now in an exaggerated, now in an attenuated form, varying so greatly as to obscure the vision of the most clear-sighted.

The echoes of the conflicts that were tearing the Legislative Assembly apart reached the furthermost parts of the provinces, exaggerated one day, attenuated the next, and varying so greatly that even the most clear-sighted had no real sense of what was happening. The only feeling everyone shared was that some kind of denouement was imminent. General uncertainty as to the nature of this denouement kept the timid bourgeois population in a terrible state of apprehension. Everybody longed for some sort of resolution.

"Puis ils commençaient à étouffer dans l’allée étroite. Jamais elle n’avait frissonné d’un si ardent frisson ; jamais le sol, ce terreau où dormaient les derniers ossements de l’ancien cimetière, n’avait laissé échapper des haleines plus troublantes. Et ils avaient encore trop d’enfance pour goûter le charme voluptueux de ce trou perdu, tout enfiévré par le printemps. Les herbes leur montaient aux genoux ; ils allaient et venaient difficilement, et, quand ils écrasaient les jeunes pousses, certaines plantes exhalaient des odeurs âcres qui les grisaient. Alors, pris d’étranges lassitudes, troublés et vacillants, les pieds comme liés par les herbes, ils s’adossaient contre la muraille, les yeux demi-clos, ne pouvant plus avancer. Il leur semblait que toute la langueur du ciel entrait en eux.","Then they began to choke in the narrow aisle. Never had she shivered so fiercely; never had the ground, this compost where the last bones of the old cemetery slept, let out more disturbing breaths. And they still had too much childhood to taste the voluptuous charm of this backwater, all fevered by the spring. The grass rose to their knees; they came and went with difficulty, and when they crushed the young shoots, certain plants exhaled acrid odors which intoxicated them. Then, seized with strange weariness, troubled and unsteady, their feet bound by the grass, they leaned against the wall, their eyes half-closed, unable to move any further. It seemed to them that all the languor of heaven entered them.","Then, too, they began to stifle in the narrow lane. Never had it throbbed with so ardent a quiver; never had that soil, in which the last bones left of the former cemetery lay mouldering, sent forth such oppressive and disturbing odours. They were still too young to relish the voluptuous charm of that secluded nook which the springtide filled with fever. The grass grew to their knees, they moved to and fro with difficulty, and certain plants, when they crushed their young shoots, sent forth a pungent odour which made them dizzy. Then, seized with strange drowsiness and staggering with giddiness, their feet as though entangled in the grass, they would lean against the wall, with half-closed eyes, unable to move a step. All the soft languor from the skies seemed to penetrate them.","Then they began to stifle in the little lane. Never had it been so full of pulsating life; never had the soil, in which the last bones left from the old cemetery lay mouldering, given off such disturbing odours. They were still too young to enjoy the voluptuous charm of that secluded spot. The grass grew up to their knees; it was no longer easy for them to move about, and certain plants, when they crushed their young roots, exuded a pungent odour that made them dizzy. Then, overcome by a strange feeling of drowsiness and reeling with giddiness, their feet as if entangled in the grass, they would lean against the wall, their eyes half closed, unable to take another step. Like bad-tempered schoolchildren, they became irritated by this sudden faintness and began to find their hideaway too confined, and decided to wander through the open fields."
"Et comme il bégayait qu’il ne savait pas, qu’il n’avait rien vu, que c’était bien étonnant, Félicité reprit, avec une sourde menace dans la voix :","And since he stammered that he didn't know, that he hadn't seen anything, that it was quite astonishing, Félicité went on, with a muffled menace in her voice:","And as he stammered that he did not know, that he had not seen anything, that it was very strange, Félicité continued in a covertly threatening voice: “A letter from Paris, from my son, Eugène; you know what I mean, don’t you?","As he stammered that he did not know what she meant, that he had not seen anything, that he did not understand, Félicité continued in a threatening undertone:"
« Pas de bêtises ! Le coquin me tuerait. Il me doit huit cents francs. »,""" No nonsense ! The rascal would kill me. He owes me eight hundred francs. »","He fancied that his brother’s gun was deliberately levelled at himself, and he recalled Félicité’s blush, and made his escape, muttering: “No tricks! The rascal would kill me. He owes me eight hundred francs.”",‘The swine wants to kill me. He owes me eight hundred francs.’
"À cette époque, l’aîné, Eugène, avait près de quarante ans. C’était un garçon de taille moyenne, légèrement chauve, tournant déjà à l’obésité. Il avait le visage de son père, un visage long, aux traits larges ; sous la peau, on devinait la graisse qui amollissait les rondeurs et donnait à la face une blancheur jaunâtre de cire. Mais si l’on sentait encore le paysan dans la structure massive et carrée de la tête, la physionomie se transfigurait, s’éclairait en dedans, lorsque le regard s’éveillait, en soulevant les paupières appesanties. Chez le fils, la lourdeur du père était devenue de la gravité. Ce gros garçon avait d’ordinaire une attitude de sommeil puissant ; à certains gestes larges et fatigués, on eût dit un géant qui se détirait les membres en attendant l’action. Par un de ces prétendus caprices de la nature où la science commence à distinguer des lois, si la ressemblance physique de Pierre était complète chez Eugène, Félicité semblait avoir contribué à fournir la matière pensante. Eugène offrait le cas curieux de certaines qualités morales et intellectuelles de sa mère enfouies dans les chairs épaisses de son père. Il avait des ambitions hautes, des instincts autoritaires, un mépris singulier pour les petits moyens et les petites fortunes. Il était la preuve que Plassans ne se trompait peut-être pas en soupçonnant que Félicité avait dans les veines quelques gouttes de sang noble. Les appétits de jouissance qui se développaient furieusement chez les Rougon, et qui étaient comme la caractéristique de cette famille, prenaient en lui une de leurs faces les plus élevées ; il voulait jouir, mais par les voluptés de l’esprit, en satisfaisant ses besoins de domination. Un tel homme n’était pas fait pour réussir en province. Il y végéta quinze ans, les yeux tournés vers Paris, guettant les occasions. Dès son retour dans sa petite ville, pour ne pas manger le pain de ses parents, il s’était fait inscrire au tableau des avocats. Il plaida de temps à autre, gagnant maigrement sa vie, sans paraître s’élever au-dessus d’une honnête médiocrité. À Plassans, on lui trouvait la voix pâteuse, les gestes lourds. Il était rare qu’il réussît à gagner la cause d’un client ; il sortait le plus souvent de la question, il divaguait, selon l’expression des fortes têtes de l’endroit. Un jour surtout, plaidant une affaire de dommages et intérêts, il s’oublia, il s’égara dans des considérations politiques, à ce point que le président lui coupa la parole. Il s’assit immédiatement en souriant d’un singulier sourire. Son client fut condamné à payer une somme considérable, ce qui ne parut pas lui faire regretter ses digressions le moins du monde. Il semblait regarder ses plaidoyers comme de simples exercices qui lui serviraient plus tard. C’était là ce que ne comprenait pas et ce qui désespérait Félicité ; elle aurait voulu que son fils dictât des lois au tribunal civil de Plassans. Elle finit par se faire une opinion très défavorable sur son fils aîné ; selon elle, ce ne pouvait être ce garçon endormi qui serait la gloire de la famille. Pierre, au contraire, avait en lui une confiance absolue, non qu’il eût des yeux plus pénétrants que sa femme, mais parce qu’il s’en tenait à la surface, et qu’il se flattait lui-même en croyant au génie d’un fils qui était son vivant portrait. Un mois avant les journées de février, Eugène devint inquiet ; un flair particulier lui fit deviner la crise. Dès lors, le pavé de Plassans lui brûla les pieds. On le vit rôder sur les promenades comme une âme en peine. Puis il se décida brusquement, il partit pour Paris. Il n’avait pas cinq cents francs dans sa poche.","At that time, the eldest, Eugene, was nearly forty years old. He was an average-sized, slightly bald boy, already turning to obesity. He had his father's face, a long, broad-featured face; under the skin one could make out the fat which softened the curves and gave the face a yellowish whiteness of wax. But if one still felt the peasant in the massive and square structure of the head, the physiognomy was transfigured, lit up within, when the gaze awoke, lifting the heavy eyelids. In the son, the heaviness of the father had become gravity. This fat boy usually had an attitude of powerful sleep; at certain broad, weary gestures, one would have said a giant stretching his limbs awaiting action. By one of those so-called whims of nature where science begins to distinguish laws, if the physical resemblance of Pierre was complete in Eugene, Felicite seemed to have contributed to supplying the thinking matter. Eugene offered the curious case of certain moral and intellectual qualities of his mother buried in the thick flesh of his father. He had lofty ambitions, authoritarian instincts, a singular contempt for small means and small fortunes. He was proof that Plassans was perhaps not mistaken in suspecting that Felicite had a few drops of noble blood in her veins. The appetites for enjoyment which developed furiously among the Rougons, and which were like the characteristic of this family, took on one of their highest aspects in him; he wanted to enjoy, but through the pleasures of the mind, by satisfying his needs for domination. Such a man was not made to succeed in the provinces. He vegetated there for fifteen years, his eyes turned towards Paris, watching for opportunities. As soon as he returned to his small town, so as not to eat his parents' bread, he had himself registered on the roll of lawyers. He pleaded from time to time, earning a meager living, without appearing to rise above honest mediocrity. At Plassans, he was found to have a thick voice and heavy gestures. Rarely did he succeed in winning a client's case; he mostly got out of the question, he rambled on, as the strong-minded locals put it. One day especially, pleading a case of damages, he forgot himself, he got lost in political considerations, to such an extent that the president cut him off. He sat down immediately, smiling a singular smile. His client was condemned to pay a considerable sum, which did not seem to make him regret his digressions in the least. He seemed to regard his pleas as mere exercises that would serve him later. This was what Félicité did not understand and what drove Félicité to despair; she would have liked her son to dictate laws to the civil tribunal of Plassans. She ends up forming a very unfavorable opinion of her eldest son; according to her, it could not be this sleeping boy who would be the glory of the family. Pierre, on the contrary, had absolute confidence in him, not because he had more penetrating eyes than his wife, but because he kept to the surface, and flattered himself by believing in the genius of a son who was his living portrait. A month before the February days, Eugene became uneasy; a particular flair made him guess the crisis. From then on, the pavement of Plassans burned his feet. He was seen prowling the promenades like a lost soul. Then he suddenly made up his mind to leave for Paris. He had not five hundred francs in his pocket.","At the period now referred to the eldest, Eugène, was nearly forty years old. He was a man of middle height, slightly bald, and already disposed to obesity. He had his father’s face, a long face with broad features; beneath his skin one could divine the fat to which were due the flabby roundness of his features, and his yellowish, waxy complexion. Though his massive square head still recalled the peasant, his physiognomy was transfigured, lit up from within as it were, when his drooping eyelids were raised and his eyes awoke to life. In the son’s case, the father’s ponderousness had turned to gravity. This big fellow, Eugène, usually preserved a heavy somnolent demeanour. At the same time, certain of his heavy, languid movements suggested those of a giant stretching his limbs pending the time for action. By one of those alleged freaks of nature, of which, however, science is now commencing to discover the laws, if physical resemblance to Pierre was perfect in Eugène, Félicité on her side seemed to have furnished him with his brains. He offered an instance of certain moral and intellectual qualities of maternal origin being embedded in the coarse flesh he had derived from his father. He cherished lofty ambitions, possessed domineering instincts, and showed singular contempt for trifling expedients and petty fortunes. He was a proof that Plassans was perhaps not mistaken in suspecting that Félicité had some blue blood in her veins. The passion for indulgence, which became formidably developed in the Rougons, and was, in fact, the family characteristic, attained in his case its highest pitch; he longed for self-gratification, but in the form of mental enjoyment such as would gratify his burning desire for domination. A man such as this was never intended to succeed in a provincial town. He vegetated there for fifteen years, his eyes turned towards Paris, watching his opportunities. On his return home he had entered his name on the rolls, in order to be independent of his parents. After that he pleaded from time to time, earning a bare livelihood, without appearing to rise above average mediocrity. At Plassans his voice was considered thick, his movements heavy. He generally wandered from the question at issue, rambled, as the wiseacres expressed it. On one occasion particularly, when he was pleading in a case for damages, he so forgot himself as to stray into a political disquisition, to such a point that the presiding judge interfered, whereupon he immediately sat down with a strange smile. His client was condemned to pay a considerable sum of money, a circumstance which did not, however, seem to cause Eugène the least regret for his irrelevant digression. He appeared to regard his speeches as mere exercises which would be of use to him later on. It was this that puzzled and disheartened Félicité. She would have liked to see her son dictating the law to the Civil Court of Plassans. At last she came to entertain a very unfavourable opinion of her first-born. To her mind this lazy fellow would never be the one to shed any lustre on the family. Pierre, on the contrary, felt absolute confidence in him, not that he had more intuition than his wife, but because external appearances sufficed him, and he flattered himself by believing in the genius of a son who was his living image. A month prior to the Revolution of February, 1848, Eugène became restless; some special inspiration made him anticipate the crisis. From that time forward he seemed to feel out of his element at Plassans. He would wander about the streets like a distressed soul. At last he formed a sudden resolution, and left for Paris, with scarcely five hundred francs in his pocket.","At this time the eldest son, Eugène, was nearly forty. He was a man of medium height, with receding hair, and already somewhat portly. He had his father’s face, a long face with thick-set features; under his skin you could divine the fat which made for the flabbiness of his features and his sallow, waxen complexion. Though his massive square head still bespoke the peasant in him, his physiognomy was transfigured, as if lit up from within, when his heavy eyelids were raised and his eyes began to sparkle. In his case, his father’s ponderousness had turned to gravity. This big fellow usually had a heavy, somnolent demeanour; some of his slow, languid movements made him seem like a giant stretching his limbs in readiness for action. By one of those alleged quirks of nature, of which science is now beginning to discover the laws, if Eugène’s physical resemblance to Pierre was total, Félicité seemed to have provided him with his brains. He was a curious example of certain moral and intellectual qualities of maternal origin becoming buried in the crude physical appearance he had inherited from his father. He had lofty ambitions and domineering instincts, and was utterly contemptuous of modest ambitions and modest fortunes. He was proof that Plassans was perhaps not mistaken in suspecting that Félicité had some blue blood in her veins. The passion for self-gratification, which became so developed in the Rougons, and was, in fact, the main characteristic of the family, reached in his case one of its purest expressions; he longed for self-gratification, but in the form of the intellectual pleasure he would derive from the satisfaction of his passion for power. A man such as this was never meant to succeed in a provincial town. He vegetated in Plassans for fifteen years, his eyes turned towards Paris, on the lookout for opportunities. On his return home he had entered his name on the rolls* in order to be independent of his parents. He took on a case from time to time, earning a bare livelihood, without distinguishing himself in any way. In Plassans his voice was considered boring, his movements heavy. He rarely succeeded in winning a case; he generally wandered off the point, rambling, as the wiseacres put it. On one occasion, when he was involved in pleading a case for damages, he so forgot himself as to digress into a political disquisition, to such a point that the presiding judge had to intervene, whereupon he immediately sat down with an odd smile on his face. His client was fined a considerable sum of money, but this did not seem to cause Eugène the least regret for his irrelevant digression. He seemed to regard his speeches as mere exercises that would be useful to him later on. It was this that puzzled and disheartened Félicité. She would have liked to see her son dictating the law to the assizes court at Plassans. She eventually came to have a very negative opinion of her first-born; to her mind, this slow-moving creature would never be the one to bring distinction to the family. Pierre, on the other hand, had absolute confidence in him, not that he was more perceptive than his wife, but because outward appearances were enough for him, and he flattered himself by believing in the genius of a son who was his spitting image. A month before the February Revolution, Eugène became restless; some special intuition made him anticipate the crisis. From that time onwards he seemed to feel out of place in Plassans. He would wander through the streets like a lost soul. At last he made a sudden decision, and left for Paris, with scarcely five hundred francs in his pocket."
"L’arrivée de la colonne insurrectionnelle, à pareille heure, surprenait l’autorité à l’improviste. Avant de se rendre à la mairie, le commandant Sicardot avait pris le temps d’aller endosser son uniforme. Il fallut ensuite courir éveiller le maire. Quand le gardien de la porte de Rome, laissé libre par les insurgés, vint annoncer que les scélérats étaient dans la ville, le commandant n’avait encore réuni à grand-peine qu’une vingtaine de gardes nationaux. Les gendarmes, dont la caserne était cependant voisine, ne purent même être prévenus. On dut fermer les portes à la hâte pour délibérer. Cinq minutes plus tard, un roulement sourd et continu annonçait l’approche de la colonne.","The arrival of the insurrectionary column at such an hour surprised the authorities unexpectedly. Before going to the town hall, Commander Sicardot had taken the time to put on his uniform. Then they had to run to wake the mayor. When the guardian of the Porte de Rome, left free by the insurgents, came to announce that the scoundrels were in the city, the commandant had still with great difficulty assembled only about twenty national guards. The gendarmes, whose barracks were close by, however, could not even be warned. We had to close the doors hastily to deliberate. Five minutes later, a dull and continuous rumble announced the approach of the column.","The arrival of the insurrectionary column at such an hour took the authorities by surprise.

The gendarmes, though their barracks were close by, could not even be warned. It was necessary to shut the town-hall doors in all haste, in order to deliberate.

"« Il doit être bien tard, tu vas te fatiguer.","“It must be very late, you will get tired.","And it was only some minutes afterwards that Silvère whispered, “It must be very late; you will get tired.”",‘It must be very late; you’ll get tired.’
« Où vas-tu donc ? demanda son mari étonné. Il est plus de neuf heures.,“So where are you going? asked her astonished husband. It's after nine o'clock.,"“Where are you going, pray?” her husband asked her with surprise. “It’s past nine o’clock.”",‘Where are you going?’ her husband asked her in surprise. ‘It’s past nine o’clock.’
"« Voyons, dit-il tendrement, tu vas de la colère aux larmes comme une enfant. Il faut être raisonnable. Je ne te gronde pas… Je voudrais simplement te voir plus heureuse, et cela dépend beaucoup de toi. »","""Let's see,"" he said tenderly, ""you go from anger to tears like a child."" You have to be reasonable. I'm not scolding you… I just want to see you happier, and that's very much up to you. »","“See, now, how you pass from anger to tears, like a child,” he said lovingly. “You must be reasonable. I’m not scolding you. I only want to see you happier, and that depends largely upon yourself.”","‘You see,’ he said gently, ‘you get angry and then start to cry, just like a child. You must be reasonable. I don’t mean to be angry... I just want to see you happier, and that depends mainly on you.’"
"Alors ils causèrent quelques minutes, en baissant la voix le plus possible. Miette parla à Silvère de son oncle et de son cousin. Pour rien au monde, elle n’aurait voulu qu’ils le vissent ainsi à califourchon sur le chaperon du mur. Justin serait implacable s’il avait une arme contre elle. Elle disait ses craintes avec l’effroi d’une écolière qui rencontre une amie que sa mère lui a défendu de fréquenter. Silvère comprit seulement qu’il ne pourrait voir Miette à son aise. Cela l’attrista beaucoup. Il promit cependant de ne plus remonter sur le mur. Ils cherchaient tous deux un moyen pour se revoir, lorsque Miette le supplia de s’en aller ; elle venait d’apercevoir Justin qui traversait la propriété, en se dirigeant du côté du puits. Silvère se hâta de descendre. Quand il fut dans la petite cour, il resta au pied du mur, prêtant l’oreille, irrité de sa fuite. Au bout de quelques minutes, il se hasarda à grimper de nouveau et à jeter un coup d’œil dans le Jas-Meiffren ; mais il vit Justin qui causait avec Miette, il retira vite la tête. Le lendemain, il ne put voir son amie, pas même de loin ; elle devait avoir fini sa besogne dans cette partie du Jas. Huit jours se passèrent ainsi, sans que les deux camarades eussent l’occasion d’échanger une seule parole. Silvère était désespéré ; il songeait à aller carrément demander Miette chez les Rébufat.","So they chatted for a few minutes, lowering their voices as much as possible. Miette spoke to Silvere about her uncle and her cousin. For nothing in the world would she have wanted them to see him like that astride the coping on the wall. Justin would be relentless if he had a gun against her. She expressed her fears with the dread of a schoolgirl who meets a friend her mother has forbidden her to see. Silvere understood only that he would not be able to see Miette at his ease. This saddened him greatly. He promised, however, not to go up on the wall again. They were both looking for a way to see each other again, when Miette begged him to go away; she had just seen Justin crossing the property, heading towards the well. Silvere hurried down. When he was in the little courtyard, he remained at the foot of the wall, listening, irritated at his flight. After a few minutes he ventured to climb again and cast a glance at Jas-Meiffren; but he saw Justin talking with Miette, he quickly withdrew his head. The next day he could not see his friend, not even from a distance; she must have finished her work in this part of the Jas. Eight days passed in this way, without the two comrades having the opportunity to exchange a single word. Silvere was in despair; he thought of going straight to ask for Miette at the Rebufats'.","They then conversed together for a few minutes, lowering their voices as much as possible. Miette spoke to Silvère of her uncle and her cousin. For all the world she would not have liked them to catch him astride the coping of the wall. Justin would be implacable with such a weapon against her. She spoke of her misgivings with the fright of a schoolgirl on meeting a friend with whom her mother has forbidden her to associate. Silvère merely understood, however, that he would not be able to see Miette at his pleasure. This made him very sad. Still, he promised that he would not climb upon the wall any more. They were both endeavouring to find some expedient for seeing each other again, when Miette suddenly begged him to go away; she had just caught sight of Justin, who was crossing the grounds in the direction of the wall. Silvère quickly descended. When he was in the little yard again, he remained by the wall to listen, irritated by his flight. After a few minutes he ventured to climb again and cast a glance into the Jas-Meiffren, but he saw Justin speaking with Miette, and quickly withdrew his head. On the following day he could see nothing of his friend, not even in the distance; she must have finished her work in that part of the Jas. A week passed in this fashion, and the young people had no opportunity of exchanging a single word. Silvère was in despair; he thought of boldly going to the Rebufats to ask for Miette.","Then they chatted for a few minutes, lowering their voices as much as possible. Miette told Silvère about her uncle and cousin. The last thing she wanted was for them to catch him on top of the wall. This would give Justin a terrible weapon to use against her. She described her fears like a schoolgirl meeting a friend with whom her mother has forbidden her to associate. Silvère realized that he would not be able to see Miette freely. This made him very sad. However, he promised that he would not climb up on the wall again. They were trying to think of some way to see each other when Miette suddenly begged him to go; she had just caught sight of Justin, who was coming across the field towards them. Silvère jumped down. When he was in the little yard again he stayed by the wall to listen, annoyed at his enforced flight. After a few minutes he ventured to climb up again and looked over the top; but he immediately saw Justin talking with Miette, and ducked down. The next day there was no sign of Miette, not even in the distance; she must have finished her work in that part of the Jas. A week went by without the two friends having any opportunity to see each other. Silvère was in despair; he thought of going directly to the Rébufats’ to ask to see Miette."
"– Voyez-vous, elle croit tromper un vieux renard de mon espèce ! Eh ! ma chère enfant, traite-moi en ami. Je suis tout prêt à vous aider secrètement… Allons, sois franche. »","“You see, she thinks she's deceiving an old fox like me! Hey! my dear child, treat me as a friend. I am ready to help you secretly…Come on, be frank. »","“Come, do you think you can deceive an old fox like me, eh? My dear child, treat me as a friend. I’m quite ready to help you secretly. Come now, be frank!”","‘Come on, do you think you can keep things from an old fox like me? My dear child, treat me as a friend. I’d be very happy to help. Come on, be frank.’"
"Elle riait, mais il y avait quelque amertume au fond de son rire. Peut-être se disait-elle que Silvère la quittait bien facilement pour courir les campagnes. Le jeune homme répondit d’un ton grave :","She was laughing, but there was some bitterness in her laughter. Perhaps she told herself that Silvere left her very easily to run around the country. The young man replied gravely:","Her smile was not altogether free from a tinge of bitterness. She was thinking, perhaps, how easily Silvère abandoned her to go and scour the country-side. But the lad gravely replied: “You are my wife, to whom I have given my whole heart.","She was joking, but not without a tinge of seriousness. She was thinking, perhaps, how easily Silvère was prepared to leave her behind. But he gravely replied:"
"Le guet-apens avait éclaté comme un coup de foudre dans la ville endormie. Les habitants des rues voisines, réveillés par le bruit de cette fusillade infernale, s’étaient assis sur leur séant, les dents claquant de peur. Pour rien au monde, ils n’auraient mis le nez à la fenêtre. Et, lentement, dans l’air déchiré par les coups de feu, une cloche de la cathédrale sonna le tocsin, sur un rythme si irrégulier, si étrange, qu’on eût dit un martèlement d’enclume, un retentissement de chaudron colossal battu par le bras d’un enfant en colère. Cette cloche hurlante, que les bourgeois ne reconnurent pas, les terrifia plus encore que les détonations des fusils, et il y en eut qui crurent entendre les bruits d’une file interminable de canons roulant sur le pavé. Ils se recouchèrent, ils s’allongèrent sous leurs couvertures, comme s’ils eussent couru quelque danger à se tenir sur leur séant, au fond des alcôves, dans les chambres closes ; le drap au menton, la respiration coupée, ils se firent tout petits, tandis que les cornes de leurs foulards leur tombaient dans les yeux, et que leurs épouses, à leur côté, enfonçaient la tête dans l’oreiller en se pâmant.","The ambush had burst like a thunderbolt in the sleeping city. The inhabitants of the neighboring streets, awakened by the noise of this infernal shooting, had sat up, their teeth chattering with fear. For nothing in the world would they have stuck their noses out the window. And slowly, in the air torn by the gunshots, a cathedral bell sounded the tocsin, to a rhythm so irregular, so strange, that it sounded like the hammering of an anvil, the resounding of a colossal cauldron being beaten. by the arm of an angry child. This howling bell, which the bourgeois did not recognize, terrified them even more than the report of guns, and there were some who thought they heard the sounds of an interminable line of cannons rolling on the pavement. They went back to bed, they stretched out under their blankets, as if they had run some danger in sitting up in the back of the alcoves, in the closed rooms; the sheet on their chins, their breath taken away, they made themselves very small, while the horns of their scarves fell into their eyes, and while their wives, at their side, buried their heads in the pillow, swooning.","The affray had burst over the slumbering town like a thunderclap. The inhabitants in the neighbouring streets, roused from sleep by this terrible fusillade, sat up in bed, their teeth chattering with fright. Nothing in the world would have induced them to poke their noses out of the window. And slowly, athwart the air, in which the shots had suddenly resounded, one of the cathedral bells began to ring the tocsin with so irregular, so strange a rhythm, that one might have thought the noise to be the hammering of an anvil or the echoes of a colossal kettle struck by a child in a fit of passion. This howling bell, whose sound the citizens did not recognise, terrified them yet more than the reports of the fire-arms had done; and there were some who thought they heard an endless train of artillery rumbling over the paving-stones. They lay down again and buried themselves beneath their blankets, as if they would have incurred some danger by still sitting up in bed in their closely-fastened rooms. With their sheets drawn up to their chins, they held their breath, and made themselves as small as possible, while their wives, by their side, almost fainted with terror as they buried their heads among the pillows.","The ambush exploded in the sleeping town like a thunderclap.

IV,IV,CHAPTER IV,CHAPTER 4
"Antoine Macquart revint à Plassans après la chute de Napoléon. Il avait eu l’incroyable chance de ne faire aucune des dernières et meurtrières campagnes de l’Empire. Il s’était traîné de dépôt en dépôt, sans que rien le tirât de sa vie hébétée de soldat. Cette vie acheva de développer ses vices naturels. Sa paresse devint raisonnée ; son ivrognerie, qui lui valut un nombre incalculable de punitions, fut dès lors à ses yeux une religion véritable. Mais ce qui fit surtout de lui le pire des garnements, ce fut le beau dédain qu’il contracta pour les pauvres diables qui gagnaient le matin leur pain du soir.","Antoine Macquart returned to Plassans after the fall of Napoleon. He had been incredibly lucky not to have fought in any of the last and murderous campaigns of the Empire. He had dragged himself from depot to depot, without anything pulling him out of his stupefied life as a soldier. This life completed the development of his natural vices. His laziness became reasoned; his drunkenness, which earned him an incalculable number of punishments, was henceforth in his eyes a true religion. But what made him above all the worst of rascals was the fine disdain he contracted for the poor devils who earned their evening bread in the morning.","Antoine Macquart had returned to Plassans after the fall of the first Napoleon. He had had the incredible good fortune to escape all the final murderous campaigns of the Empire. He had moved from barracks to barracks, dragging on his brutifying military life. This mode of existence brought his natural vices to full development. His idleness became deliberate; his intemperance, which brought him countless punishments, became, to his mind, a veritable religious duty. But that which above all made him the worst of scapegraces was the supercilious disdain which he entertained for the poor devils who had to earn their bread.","ANTOINE MACQUART returned to Plassans after the fall of Napoleon.

"Ils allaient toujours. Ils arrivèrent bientôt à la petite traverse dont Miette avait parlé, bout de ruelle qui s’enfonce dans la campagne, menant à un village bâti au bord de la Viorne. Mais ils ne s’arrêtèrent pas, ils continuèrent à descendre, en feignant de ne point voir ce sentier qu’ils s’étaient promis de ne point dépasser. Ce fut seulement quelques minutes plus loin que Silvère murmura :","They were still going. They soon arrived at the little crossroad Miette had spoken of, the end of a lane which plunges into the countryside, leading to a village built on the banks of the Viorne. But they did not stop, they continued to descend, pretending not to see this path which they had promised themselves not to cross. It was only a few minutes later that Silvere whispered:","They still walked on, and soon reached the little crossroad mentioned by Miette—a bit of a lane which led through the fields to a village on the banks of the Viorne.

"Lorsque, à dix-sept ans, Pierre apprit et put comprendre les désordres d’Adélaïde et la singulière situation d’Antoine et d’Ursule, il ne parut ni triste ni indigné, mais simplement très préoccupé du parti que ses intérêts lui conseillaient de prendre. Des trois enfants, lui seul avait suivi l’école avec une certaine assiduité. Un paysan qui commence à sentir la nécessité de l’instruction, devient le plus souvent un calculateur féroce. Ce fut à l’école que ses camarades, par leurs huées et la façon insultante dont ils traitaient son frère, lui donnèrent les premiers soupçons. Plus tard, il s’expliqua bien des regards, bien des paroles. Il vit enfin clairement la maison au pillage. Dès lors, Antoine et Ursule furent pour lui des parasites éhontés, des bouches qui dévoraient son bien. Quant à sa mère, il la regarda du même œil que le faubourg, comme une femme bonne à enfermer, qui finirait par manger son argent, s’il n’y mettait ordre. Ce qui acheva de le navrer, ce furent les vols du maraîcher. L’enfant tapageur se transforma, du jour au lendemain, en un garçon économe et égoïste, mûri hâtivement dans le sens de ses instincts par l’étrange vie de gaspillage qu’il ne pouvait voir maintenant autour de lui sans en avoir le cœur crevé. C’était à lui ces légumes sur la vente desquels le maraîcher prélevait les plus gros bénéfices ; c’était à lui ce vin bu, ce pain mangé par les bâtards de sa mère. Toute la maison, toute la fortune était à lui. Dans sa logique de paysan, lui seul, fils légitime, devait hériter. Et comme les biens périclitaient, comme tout le monde mordait avidement à sa fortune future, il chercha le moyen de jeter ces gens à la porte, mère, frère, sœur, domestiques, et d’hériter immédiatement.","When, at the age of seventeen, Pierre learned and was able to understand the disorders of Adelaide and the singular situation of Antoine and Ursule, he did not seem sad or indignant, but simply very concerned about the party that his interests advised him to take. to take. Of the three children, he alone had attended school with some assiduity. A peasant who begins to feel the need for education most often becomes a ferocious calculator. It was at school that his classmates, by their boos and the insulting way in which they treated his brother, gave him the first suspicions. Later, he explained to himself many looks, many words. He finally clearly saw the house being looted. From then on, Antoine and Ursule were for him shameless parasites, mouths that devoured his property. As for his mother, he looked at her with the same eye as the faubourg, like a woman fit to be locked up, who would end up eating up her money if he didn't put some order into it. What completed to upset him were the thefts of the market gardener. The rowdy child was transformed, overnight, into a thrifty and selfish boy, hastily matured in the sense of his instincts by the strange wasteful life he could not now see around him without being heartbroken. . It was his those vegetables from the sale of which the market gardener took the greatest profits; it was his that drank wine, that bread eaten by his mother's bastards. The whole house, the whole fortune was his. According to his peasant logic, he alone, the legitimate son, should inherit. And as the property was declining, as everyone was greedily biting into his future fortune, he looked for a way to throw these people out, mother, brother, sister, servants, and to inherit immediately.","When, at the age of seventeen, Pierre observed and was able to understand Adélaïde’s disorders and the singular position of Antoine and Ursule, he seemed neither sorry nor indignant, but simply worried as to the course which would best serve his own interests. He was the only one of the three children who had pursued his studies with any industry. When a peasant begins to feel the need of instruction he most frequently becomes a fierce calculator. At school Pierre’s playmates roused his first suspicions by the manner in which they treated and hooted his brother. Later on he came to understand the significance of many looks and words. And at last he clearly saw that the house was being pillaged. From that time forward he regarded Antoine and Ursule as shameless parasites, mouths that were devouring his own substance. Like the people of the Faubourg, he thought that his mother was a fit subject for a lunatic asylum, and feared she would end by squandering all her money, if he did not take steps to prevent it. What gave him the finishing stroke was the dishonesty of the gardener who cultivated the land. At this, in one day, the unruly child was transformed into a thrifty, selfish lad, hurriedly matured, as regards his instincts, by the strange improvident life which he could no longer bear to see around him without a feeling of anguish. Those vegetables, from the sale of which the market-gardener derived the largest profits, really belonged to him; the wine which his mother’s offspring drank, the bread they ate, also belonged to him. The whole house, the entire fortune, was his by right; according to his boorish logic, he alone, the legitimate son, was the heir. And as his riches were in danger, as everybody was greedily gnawing at his future fortune, he sought a means of turning them all out—mother, brother, sister, servants—and of succeeding immediately to his inheritance.","When, at the age of seventeen, Pierre became fully aware of the disorderliness of Adélaïde’s life, and thus of the special position of Antoine and Ursule, he seemed neither sorry nor angry, but simply resolved to follow the course that would best serve his interests. He was the only one of the three children who had pursued his studies with any diligence. When a peasant begins to feel the need for instruction, he usually becomes fiercely calculating. His suspicions were first aroused at school by the way his playmates made fun of his brother. Later on he came to understand the significance of many looks and remarks. And at last he clearly saw that the house was being pillaged. From that time onwards he regarded Antoine and Ursule as shameless parasites, mouths that were devouring everything that was his. As for his mother, he began to think, like all the neighbours, that she was fit only for the lunatic asylum, and feared she would squander all her money if he did not do something to prevent it. The last straw was the thieving of the gardener. From one day to the next the unruly child was transformed into a thrifty, selfish lad whose instincts had been transformed by the life of wastefulness that he could no longer bear to see around him. The vegetables, from the sale of which the gardener derived the biggest profits, really belonged to him; the wine which his mother’s offspring drank, and the bread they ate, also belonged to him. The whole house, the entire fortune, was his by right. According to his peasant logic, he alone, the legitimate son, was the heir. And as his future fortune was in danger, since everybody was greedily gnawing at it, he sought a way of turning them all out — mother, brother, sister, servants — and of taking immediate possession of his inheritance."
"La vérité était qu’il ne savait quel parti prendre. Son impuissance à trouver un moyen immédiat d’avoir sa part et de se venger, activait encore sa fièvre furieuse. Il revint chez sa mère, il lui fit subir un interrogatoire honteux. La malheureuse femme ne pouvait que le renvoyer chez Pierre.","The truth was, he didn't know which side to take. His impotence to find an immediate way to have his share and to avenge himself, further activated his furious fever. He returned to his mother, he subjected her to a shameful interrogation. The unfortunate woman could only send him back to Pierre.","The truth was, however, he did not know what to do. His inability to hit upon any immediate expedient for obtaining his share of the money and satisfying his desire of revenge increased his fury. He went back to his mother and subjected her to a disgraceful cross-examination. The wretched woman could do nothing but again refer him to Pierre.","The truth, however, was that he had no idea what to do. His inability to think of how to get his share of the money and avenge himself made him even more furious. He returned to his mother and subjected her to a pitiless cross-examination. The poor woman could do nothing but send him back to Pierre."
"Et ils descendirent la côte, ils regagnèrent la route en courant. Puis, quand ils furent en bas, ils levèrent la tête, comme pour dire adieu à cette roche sur laquelle ils avaient pleuré, en se brûlant les lèvres d’un baiser. Mais ils ne reparlèrent point de cette caresse ardente qui avait mis dans leur tendresse un besoin nouveau, vague encore, et qu’ils n’osaient formuler. Ils ne se donnèrent même pas le bras, sous prétexte de marcher plus vite. Et ils marchaient gaiement, un peu confus, sans savoir pourquoi, quand ils venaient à se regarder. Autour d’eux, le jour grandissait. Le jeune homme, que son patron envoyait parfois à Orchères, choisissait sans hésiter les bons sentiers, les plus directs. Ils firent ainsi plus de deux lieues, dans des chemins creux, le long de haies et de murailles interminables. Miette accusait Silvère de l’avoir égarée. Souvent, pendant des quarts d’heure entiers, ils ne voyaient pas un bout du pays, ils n’apercevaient, au-dessus des murailles et des haies, que de longues files d’amandiers dont les branches maigres se détachaient sur la pâleur du ciel.","And they went down the hill, they got back to the road running. Then, when they were down, they raised their heads, as if to bid farewell to that rock on which they had wept, burning their lips with a kiss. But they did not speak again of this ardent caress which had filled their tenderness with a new need, still vague, and which they dared not articulate. They didn't even give each other arm, on the pretext of walking faster. And they walked merrily, a little confused, without knowing why, when they came to look at each other. Around them, the day was growing. The young man, whom his boss sometimes sent to Orchères, unhesitatingly chose the right paths, the most direct ones. They thus covered more than two leagues, in sunken roads, along hedges and interminable walls. Miette accused Silvere of having led her astray. Often, for whole quarters of an hour, they could not see one end of the country, they only saw, above the walls and the hedges, long rows of almond trees whose slender branches stood out against the pallor of the sky.","Thereupon they descended the hill and ran until they reached the high road. When they were below they raised their heads as if to say farewell to that rock on which they had wept while their kisses burned their lips. But they did not again speak of that ardent embrace which had thrilled them so strongly with vague, unknown desire. Under the pretext of walking more quickly they did not even take each other’s arm. They experienced some slight confusion when they looked at one another, though why they could not tell. Meantime the dawn was rising around them. The young man, who had sometimes been sent to Orcheres by his master, knew all the shortest cuts. Thus they walked on for more than two leagues, along dingle paths by the side of interminable ledges and walls. Now and again Miette accused Silvère of having taken her the wrong way; for, at times—for a quarter of an hour at a stretch—they lost all sight of the surrounding country, seeing above the walls and hedges nothing but long rows of almond-trees whose slender branches showed sharply against the pale sky.","They descended the hill and ran until they reached the high-road. When they were at the bottom they looked up as if to bid farewell to the rock on which they had wept and where their kisses had burned their lips. But they did not speak again of the passionate embrace that had filled them with new, strange feelings of desire, feelings they dared not admit. They did not even take each other’s arm, under the pretext of walking faster. They felt a little embarrassed when they looked at one another, though they did not know why. The dawn was rising around them. The young man, who had sometimes been sent to Orchères by his master, knew all the short-cuts.

"Pendant plusieurs années, le terrain de l’ancien cimetière Saint-Mittre resta un objet d’épouvante. Ouvert à tous venants, sur le bord d’une grande route, il demeura désert, en proie de nouveau aux herbes folles. La ville, qui comptait sans doute le vendre et y voir bâtir des maisons, ne dut pas trouver d’acquéreur ; peut-être le souvenir du tas d’os et de ce tombereau allant et venant par les rues, seul, avec le lourd entêtement d’un cauchemar, fit-il reculer les gens ; peut-être faut-il plutôt expliquer le fait par les paresses de la province, par cette répugnance qu’elle éprouve à détruire et à reconstruire. La vérité est que la ville garda le terrain, et qu’elle finit même par oublier son désir de le vendre. Elle ne l’entoura seulement pas d’une palissade ; entra qui voulut. Et, peu à peu, les années aidant, on s’habitua à ce coin vide ; on s’assit sur l’herbe des bords, on traversa le champ, on le peupla. Quand les pieds des promeneurs eurent usé le tapis d’herbe, et que la terre battue fut devenue grise et dure, l’ancien cimetière eut quelque ressemblance avec une place publique mal nivelée. Pour mieux effacer tout souvenir répugnant, les habitants furent, à leur insu, conduits lentement à changer l’appellation du terrain ; on se contenta de garder le nom du saint, dont on baptisa également le cul-de-sac qui se creuse dans un coin du champ ; il y eut l’aire Saint-Mittre et l’impasse Saint-Mittre.","For several years, the grounds of the old Saint-Mittre cemetery remained an object of horror. Open to all comers, on the edge of a main road, it remained deserted, once again prey to weeds. The city, which no doubt intended to sell it and see houses built there, was unable to find a buyer; perhaps the memory of the pile of bones and of this dump truck going and coming through the streets, alone, with the heavy obstinacy of a nightmare, made people recoil; perhaps the fact should rather be explained by the laziness of the province, by this repugnance which it feels to destroy and to rebuild. The truth is that the city kept the land, and even ended up forgetting its desire to sell it. She did not just surround it with a palisade; entered who wanted. And, little by little, over the years, we got used to this empty corner; we sat down on the grass on the banks, we crossed the field, we peopled it. When the feet of walkers had worn away the carpet of grass, and the beaten earth had become gray and hard, the old cemetery had some resemblance to a badly leveled public square. To better erase any repugnant memory, the inhabitants were, unwittingly, slowly led to change the name of the land; they contented themselves with keeping the name of the saint, whose cul-de-sac which is hollowed out in a corner of the field was also baptized; there was the Saint-Mittre area and the Saint-Mittre impasse.","For several years the old cemetery remained an object of terror. Although it adjoined the main thoroughfare and was open to all comers, it was left quite deserted, a prey to fresh vegetable growth. The local authorities, who had doubtless counted on selling it and seeing houses built upon it, were evidently unable to find a purchaser. The recollection of the heaps of bones and the cart persistently jolting through the streets may have made people recoil from the spot; or perhaps the indifference that was shown was due to the indolence, the repugnance to pulling down and setting up again, which is characteristic of country people. At all events the authorities still retained possession of the ground, and at last forgot their desire to dispose of it. They did not even erect a fence round it, but left it open to all comers. Then, as time rolled on, people gradually grew accustomed to this barren spot; they would sit on the grass at the edges, walk about, or gather in groups. When the grass had been worn away and the trodden soil had become grey and hard, the old cemetery resembled a badly-levelled public square. As if the more effectually to efface the memory of all objectionable associations, the inhabitants slowly changed the very appellation of the place, retaining but the name of the saint, which was likewise applied to the blind alley dipping down at one corner of the field. Thus there was the Aire Saint-Mittre and the Impasse Saint-Mittre.","For several years the plot of land occupied by the Saint-Mittre cemetery remained a source of terror. Although it was next to a main road and was open to all comers, it was simply abandoned, and was invaded once more by weeds. The town council, which had probably counted on selling it and seeing houses built on it, was evidently unable to find a buyer. The memory of the piles of bones and the tumbril jolting through the streets like some recurrent nightmare may have put people off; or perhaps it was simply a question of the inertia, the repugnance at the idea of destroying or rebuilding anything, that is characteristic of people in the provinces. At all events the town council kept possession of the land, and eventually lost interest in it. They did not even put a fence round it, but left it completely open. Then, as the years went by, people gradually grew accustomed to this empty spot; they would sit on the edge of the grass, walk through it, or gather there in groups. When the grass had been worn away and the well-trodden soil had become grey and hard, the old cemetery seemed like a badly levelled public square. Unconsciously, to suppress all memory of its unpleasant associations, the towns-people eventually changed the very name of the place, keeping only the name of the saint, which was also given to the alley that sloped down in one corner of the field. Thus there was the Aire Saint-Mittre and the Impasse Saint-Mittre."

"La fusillade reprenait, à gauche, dans les champs d’oliviers. Des galops sourds de cavalerie montaient de la plaine des Nores. Et, par instants, il y avait de grands cris d’hommes qu’on égorge. Des fumées épaisses arrivaient, traînaient sous les ormes de l’esplanade. Mais Silvère n’entendait plus, ne voyait plus. Pascal, qui descendait en courant vers la plaine, l’aperçut, vautré à terre, et s’approcha, le croyant blessé. Dès que le jeune homme l’eut reconnu, il se cramponna à lui. Il lui montrait Miette.","The shooting resumed, on the left, in the olive groves. Dull gallops of cavalry rose from the plain of the Nores. And, from time to time, there were loud cries of men being slaughtered. Thick smoke was coming in, trailing under the elm trees on the esplanade. But Silvere no longer heard, no longer saw. Pascal, who was running down towards the plain, saw him sprawled on the ground, and approached, believing him to be wounded. As soon as the young man recognized him, he clung to him.

"Quand il fut revenu à Plassans, la certitude qu’il avait les mains liées rendit Antoine plus menaçant encore. Pendant un mois, on ne vit que lui dans la ville. Il courait les rues, contant son histoire à qui voulait l’entendre. Lorsqu’il avait réussi à se faire donner une pièce de vingt sous par sa mère, il allait la boire dans quelque cabaret, et là criait tout haut que son frère était une canaille qui aurait bientôt de ses nouvelles. En de pareils endroits, la douce fraternité qui règne entre ivrognes lui donnait un auditoire sympathique ; toute la crapule de la ville épousait sa querelle ; c’étaient des invectives sans fin contre ce gueux de Rougon qui laissait sans pain un brave soldat, et la séance se terminait d’ordinaire par la condamnation générale de tous les riches. Antoine, par un raffinement de vengeance, continuait à se promener avec son képi, son pantalon d’ordonnance et sa vieille veste de velours jaune, bien que sa mère lui eût offert de lui acheter des vêtements plus convenables. Il affichait ses guenilles, les étalait le dimanche, en plein cours Sauvaire.","When he returned to Plassans, the certainty that his hands were tied made Antoine even more menacing. For a month, only him was seen in the city. He ran the streets, telling his story to anyone who wanted to hear it. When he had succeeded in getting a twenty-sou piece from his mother, he went to drink it in some cabaret, and there shouted aloud that his brother was a scoundrel who would soon have news of him. In such places, the sweet fraternity which reigns among drunkards gave him a sympathetic audience; all the scoundrel of the town espoused his quarrel; there were endless invectives against that beggar Rougon who left a brave soldier without bread, and the meeting usually ended with the general condemnation of all the rich. Antoine, out of a refinement of revenge, continued to walk about in his kepi, his orderly trousers and his old yellow velvet jacket, although his mother had offered to buy him more suitable clothes. He flaunted his rags, displayed them on Sundays, right in the Cours Sauvaire.","When he was back again in Plassans, Antoine became the more menacing from the conviction that his hands were tied. During a whole month he was seen all over the place. He paraded the streets, recounting his story to all who would listen to him. Whenever he succeeded in extorting a franc from his mother, he would drink it away at some tavern, where he would revile his brother, declaring that the rascal should shortly hear from him. In places like these, the good-natured fraternity which reigns among drunkards procured him a sympathetic audience; all the scum of the town espoused his cause, and poured forth bitter imprecations against that rascal Rougon, who left a brave soldier to starve; the discussion generally terminating with an indiscriminate condemnation of the rich. Antoine, the better to revenge himself, continued to march about in his regimental cap and trousers and his old yellow velvet jacket, although his mother had offered to purchase some more becoming clothes for him. But no; he preferred to make a display of his rags, and paraded them on Sundays in the most frequented parts of the Cours Sauvaire.","Back in Plassans, Antoine became an even more threatening presence now that he was convinced that his hands were tied.

In places like these the fellow-feeling of drunkards meant that he had a sympathetic audience; all the town’s riffraff took up his cause and endlessly abused the villain Rougon, who was letting a brave soldier starve; their outpourings usually ended with a blanket denunciation of the rich.

Un moment, elle devint maussade, quand le préfet accorda un mot à ce pauvre Granoux qui tournait autour de lui, quêtant un éloge ; sans doute, M. de Blériot connaissait déjà l’histoire du marteau, car l’ancien marchand d’amandes rougit comme une jeune fille et parut dire qu’il n’avait fait que son devoir.

Puis il y a le boucher, le boulanger, le fruitier… »","'The pastry chef's bill is at least a thousand francs,' Félicité went on in her sweet tone, 'and we may owe the liqueur maker twice as much. Then there is the butcher, the baker, the fruit seller…”","“The pastry-cook’s bill amounts to at least a thousand francs,” Félicité resumed, in her sweetest tone, “and we probably owe twice as much to the liqueur-dealer. Then there’s the butcher, the baker, the greengrocer——”","‘The pastrycook’s bill comes to at least a thousand francs,’ Félicité resumed in her smoothest tone, ‘and we probably owe twice as much to the wine-and-spirits dealer.

"Après dix bonnes minutes de discussion, il fut décidé qu’on avancerait jusqu’à la porte, pour voir ce que signifiait cette ombre et ce silence inquiétants. La porte était entrouverte. Un des conjurés passa la tête et la retira vivement, disant qu’il y avait, sous le porche, un homme assis contre le mur, avec un fusil entre les jambes, et qui dormait. Rougon, voyant qu’il pouvait débuter par un exploit, entra le premier, s’empara de l’homme et le maintint, pendant que Roudier le bâillonnait. Ce premier succès, remporté dans le silence, encouragea singulièrement la petite troupe, qui avait rêvé une fusillade très meurtrière. Et Rougon faisait des signes impérieux pour que la joie de ses soldats n’éclatât pas trop bruyamment.","After a good ten minutes of discussion, it was decided that we would walk to the door, to see what this disturbing shadow and silence meant. The door was ajar. One of the conspirators stuck his head out and drew it back quickly, saying that there was a man sitting against the wall under the porch, with a gun between his legs, and sleeping. Rougon, seeing that he could begin with an exploit, entered first, seized the man and held him down, while Roudier gagged him. This first success, won in silence, singularly encouraged the little troop, who had dreamed of a very deadly fusillade. And Rougon made imperious signs so that the joy of his soldiers would not break out too loudly.","After a good ten minutes’ discussion, it was decided to advance as far as the door, so as to ascertain what might be the meaning of this disquieting darkness and silence. The door proved to be half open. One of the conspirators thereupon popped his head in, but quickly withdrew it, announcing that there was a man under the porch, sitting against the wall fast asleep, with a gun between his legs. Rougon, seeing a chance of commencing with a deed of valour, thereupon entered first, and, seizing the man, held him down while Roudier gagged him. This first triumph, gained in silence, singularly emboldened the little troop, who had dreamed of a murderous fusillade. And Rougon had to make imperious signs to restrain his soldiers from indulging in over-boisterous delight.","After a good ten minutes’ discussion it was decided to advance as far as the door, to ascertain the meaning of this disquieting darkness and silence.

"Pour la troisième fois, la nuit, la nuit pleine d’angoisse tombait sur Plassans. La ville agonisante en était aux derniers râles. Les bourgeois rentraient rapidement chez eux, les portes se barricadaient avec un grand bruit de boulons et de barres de fer. Le sentiment général semblait être que Plassans n’existerait plus le lendemain, qu’il se serait abîmé sous terre ou évaporé dans le ciel. Quand Rougon rentra pour dîner, il trouva les rues absolument désertes. Cette solitude le rendit triste et mélancolique. Aussi, à la fin du repas, eut-il une faiblesse, et demanda-t-il à sa femme s’il était nécessaire de donner suite à l’insurrection que Macquart préparait.","For the third time, the night, the night full of anguish fell on Plassans. The dying city was in its last gasps. The bourgeois returned quickly to their homes, the doors were barricaded with a great noise of bolts and iron bars. The general feeling seemed to be that Plassans would no longer exist the next day, that he would have sunk underground or evaporated into the sky. When Rougon returned for dinner, he found the streets absolutely deserted. This loneliness made him sad and melancholy. So, at the end of the meal, he had a weakness, and he asked his wife if it was necessary to follow up the insurrection which Macquart was preparing.","And now for the third time a night full of anguish fell upon Plassans. The unhappy town was almost at its death-rattle. The citizens hastened home and barricaded their doors with a great clattering of iron bolts and bars. The general feeling seemed to be that, by the morrow, Plassans would no longer exist, that it would either be swallowed up by the earth or would evaporate in the atmosphere. When Rougon went home to dine, he found the streets completely deserted. This desolation made him sad and melancholy. As a result of this, when he had finished his meal, he felt some slight misgivings, and asked his wife if it were necessary to follow up the insurrection that Macquart was preparing.","Now, for the third time, a night of terror was descending upon Plassans. The town was like a dying man about to breathe his last. The townsfolk hurried home and barricaded their doors with a great thudding of iron bolts and bars.

When Rougon went home to dine he found the streets completely deserted. This desolation made him quite sad. So much so that, when he had finished his meal, he felt slight misgivings and asked his wife if it was really necessary to go ahead with the insurrection Macquart was preparing."
"Et il crut devoir faire quelques plaisanteries grasses. Tante Dide s’était remise à tourner dans la pièce. Elle ne prononça plus une parole. Vers le soir, Antoine s’éloigna, après avoir mis une blouse et enfoncé sur ses yeux une casquette profonde que sa mère alla lui acheter. Il rentra dans la ville, comme il en était sorti, en contant une histoire aux gardes nationaux qui gardaient la porte de Rome. Puis il gagna le vieux quartier où, mystérieusement, il se glissa de porte en porte. Tous les républicains exaltés, tous les affiliés qui n’avaient pas suivi la bande, se trouvèrent, vers neuf heures, réunis dans un café borgne où Macquart leur avait donné rendez-vous. Quand il y eut là une cinquantaine d’hommes, il leur tint un discours où il parla d’une vengeance personnelle à satisfaire, de victoire à remporter, de joug honteux à secouer, et finit en se faisant fort de leur livrer la mairie en dix minutes. Il en sortait, elle était vide ; le drapeau rouge y flotterait cette nuit même, s’ils le voulaient. Les ouvriers se consultèrent : à cette heure, la réaction agonisait, les insurgés étaient aux portes, il serait honorable de ne pas les attendre pour reprendre le pouvoir, ce qui permettrait de les recevoir en frères, les portes grandes ouvertes, les rues et les places pavoisées. D’ailleurs, personne ne se défia de Macquart ; sa haine contre les Rougon, la vengeance personnelle dont il parlait, répondaient de sa loyauté. Il fut convenu que tous ceux qui étaient chasseurs et qui avaient chez eux un fusil iraient le chercher, et qu’à minuit, la bande se trouverait sur la place de l’Hôtel-de-Ville. Une question de détail faillit les arrêter, ils n’avaient pas de balles ; mais ils décidèrent qu’ils chargeraient leurs armes avec du plomb à perdrix, ce qui même était inutile, puisqu’ils ne devaient rencontrer aucune résistance.","And he thought he had to make a few fat jokes. Aunt Dide was circling the room again. She didn't say another word. Towards evening Antoine went away, after putting on a blouse and pulling down over his eyes a deep cap which his mother went to buy for him. He re-entered the city as he had left it, telling a story to the National Guards who guarded the Porte de Rome. Then he reached the old quarter where, mysteriously, he slipped from door to door. All the enthusiastic Republicans, all the affiliates who had not followed the band, found themselves, towards nine o'clock, assembled in a one-eyed cafe where Macquart had arranged to meet them. When there were about fifty men there, he gave them a speech in which he spoke of a personal vengeance to be satisfied, of victory to be won, of a shameful yoke to be shaken off, and ended by making himself strong to hand over the town hall to them in ten minutes. He was coming out, it was empty; the red flag would fly there that very night, if they wanted to. The workers consulted one another: at this hour, the reaction was dying, the insurgents were at the gates, it would be honorable not to wait for them to regain power, which would allow them to be received as brothers, the doors wide open, the streets and the flagged squares. Besides, no one mistrusted Macquart; his hatred against the Rougons, the personal revenge of which he spoke, guaranteed his loyalty. It was agreed that all those who were hunters and who had a gun at home would go and fetch it, and that at midnight the band would be in the Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville. A matter of detail nearly stopped them, they had no bullets; but they decided that they would load their guns with partridge lead, which was even useless, since they were to encounter no resistance.","Then he thought he might as well indulge in a few coarse jokes. Aunt Dide had begun to bustle about the room again. She did not say a word. Towards the evening Antoine went out, after putting on a blouse, and pulling over his eyes a big cap which his mother had bought for him. He returned into the town in the same manner as he had quitted it, by relating some nonsensical story to the national guards who were on duty at the Rome Gate. Then he made his way to the old quarter, where he crept from house to house in a mysterious manner. All the Republicans of advanced views, all the members of the brotherhood who had not followed the insurrectionary army, met in an obscure inn, where Macquart had made an appointment with them. When about fifty men were assembled, he made a speech, in which he spoke of personal vengeance that must be wreaked, of a victory that must be gained, and of a disgraceful yoke that must be thrown off. And he ended by undertaking to deliver the town-hall over to them in ten minutes. He had just left it, it was quite unguarded, he said, and the red flag would wave over it that very night if they so desired. The workmen deliberated. At that moment the reaction seemed to be in its death throes. The insurgents were virtually at the gates of the town. It would therefore be more honourable to make an effort to regain power without awaiting their return, so as to be able to receive them as brothers, with the gates wide open, and the streets and squares adorned with flags. Moreover, none of those present distrusted Macquart. His hatred of the Rougons, the personal vengeance of which he spoke, could be taken as guaranteeing his loyalty. It was arranged that each of them who was a sportsman and had a gun at home should fetch it, and that the band should assemble at midnight in the neighbourhood of the town-hall. A question of detail very nearly put an end to their plans—they had no bullets; however, they decided to load their weapons with small shot: and even that seemed unnecessary, as they were told that they would meet with no resistance.","Then he thought it fitting to make a few coarse jokes.

Then he made his way to the old quarter, where he crept stealthily from door to door. All the dyed-in-the-wool republicans, all those comrades who had not followed the army of insurgents, gathered in a disreputable café where Macquart had arranged for them to meet.

"Ce calcul sourit à Rébufat. Il alla jusqu’à tâter les bras de l’enfant, qu’il déclara avec satisfaction très forte pour son âge. Miette avait alors neuf ans. Dès le lendemain, il l’utilisa. Le travail des paysannes, dans le Midi, est beaucoup plus doux que dans le Nord. On y voit rarement les femmes occupées à bêcher la terre, à porter les fardeaux, à faire des besognes d’hommes. Elles lient les gerbes, cueillent les olives et les feuilles de mûrier ; leur occupation la plus pénible est d’arracher les mauvaises herbes. Miette travailla gaiement. La vie en plein air était sa joie et sa santé. Tant que sa tante vécut, elle n’eut que des rires. La brave femme, malgré ses brusqueries, l’aimait comme son enfant ; elle lui défendait de faire les gros travaux dont son mari tentait parfois de la charger, et elle criait à ce dernier :","This calculation smiles on Rebufat. He went so far as to feel the arms of the child, whom he declared with satisfaction to be very strong for his age. Miette was then nine years old. The next day he used it. The work of peasant women in the South is much gentler than in the North. We rarely see the women busy digging the earth, carrying the burdens, doing men's chores. They bind sheaves, pick olives and mulberry leaves; their most laborious occupation is pulling weeds. Miette worked cheerfully. Outdoor life was his joy and his health. As long as her aunt lived, she had nothing but laughter. The brave woman, in spite of her abruptness, loved him as her child; she forbade him to do the heavy work which her husband sometimes tried to entrust to her, and she cried out to him:","This calculation pleased Rebufat. He went so far as to feel the little thing’s arms, and declared with satisfaction that she was sturdy for her age. Miette was then nine years old. From the very next day he made use of her. The work of the peasant-woman in the South of France is much lighter than in the North. One seldom sees them employed in digging the ground, carrying loads, or doing other kinds of men’s work. They bind sheaves, gather olives and mulberry leaves; perhaps their most laborious work is that of weeding. Miette worked away willingly. Open-air life was her delight, her health. So long as her aunt lived she was always smiling. The good woman, in spite of her roughness, at last loved her as her own child; she forbade her doing the hard work which her husband sometimes tried to force upon her, saying to the latter:","This suggestion appealed to Rébufat.

As long as her aunt was alive she always had a smile on her face.

"Antoine, à cette déclaration faite d’une voix nette, eut un geste de rage. Il entra violemment dans le salon, passa dans la chambre à coucher, bouleversa le lit, regardant derrière les rideaux et sous les meubles. Les quatre grands gaillards l’aidaient. Pendant un quart d’heure, ils fouillèrent l’appartement. Félicité s’était paisiblement assise sur le canapé du salon et s’occupait à renouer les cordons de ses jupes, comme une personne qui vient d’être surprise dans son sommeil, et qui n’a pas eu le temps de se vêtir convenablement.","Antoine, at this declaration made in a clear voice, made a gesture of rage. He stormed into the living room, went into the bedroom, turned the bed upside down, looking behind the curtains and under the furniture. The four big guys were helping him.

"À Plassans, dans cette ville close où la division des classes se trouvait si nettement marquée en 1848, le contrecoup des événements politiques était très sourd. Aujourd’hui même, la voix du peuple s’y étouffe ; la bourgeoisie y met sa prudence, la noblesse son désespoir muet, le clergé sa fine sournoiserie. Que des rois se volent un trône ou que des républiques se fondent, la ville s’agite à peine. On dort à Plassans, quand on se bat à Paris. Mais la surface a beau paraître calme et indifférente, il y a, au fond, un travail caché très curieux à étudier. Si les coups de fusil sont rares dans les rues, les intrigues dévorent les salons de la ville neuve et du quartier Saint-Marc. Jusqu’en 1830, le peuple n’a pas compté. Encore aujourd’hui, on agit comme s’il n’était pas. Tout se passe entre le clergé, la noblesse et la bourgeoisie. Les prêtres, très nombreux, donnent le ton à la politique de l’endroit ; ce sont des mines souterraines, des coups dans l’ombre, une tactique savante et peureuse qui permet à peine de faire un pas en avant ou en arrière tous les dix ans. Ces luttes secrètes d’hommes qui veulent avant tout éviter le bruit, demandent une finesse particulière, une aptitude aux petites choses, une patience de gens privés de passions. Et c’est ainsi que les lenteurs provinciales, dont on se moque volontiers à Paris, sont pleines de traîtrises, d’égorgillements sournois, de défaites et de victoires cachées. Ces bonshommes, surtout quand leurs intérêts sont en jeu, tuent à domicile, à coups de chiquenaudes, comme nous tuons à coups de canon, en place publique.","In Plassans, in this closed town where the division of classes was so clearly marked in 1848, the backlash of political events was very muted. Even today, the voice of the people is drowned out there; the bourgeoisie put their prudence into it, the nobility their mute despair, the clergy their shrewd deceit. Whether kings are stealing a throne or republics are being founded, the city barely stirs. We sleep at Plassans, when we fight in Paris. But although the surface may seem calm and indifferent, there is, at the bottom, a very curious hidden work to study. If gunshots are rare in the streets, intrigues devour the salons of the new town and the Saint-Marc district. Until 1830, the people did not count. Even today, we act as if it was not. Everything happens between the clergy, the nobility and the bourgeoisie. The numerous priests set the tone for local politics; they are underground mines, blows in the shadows, a skilful and fearful tactic that barely allows you to take a step forward or back every ten years. These secret struggles of men who want above all to avoid noise, require a particular finesse, an aptitude for small things, the patience of people deprived of passions. And so it is that provincial delays, which are readily laughed at in Paris, are full of treachery, sly strangling, defeats and hidden victories. These fellows, especially when their interests are at stake, kill at home, with flicks, as we kill with cannons, in public places.","In that closed, sequestered town of Plassans, where class distinction was so clearly marked in 1848, the commotion caused by political events was very slight. Even at the present day the popular voice sounds very faintly there; the middle classes bring their prudence to bear in the matter, the nobility their mute despair, and the clergy their shrewd cunning. Kings may usurp thrones, or republics may be established, without scarcely any stir in the town. Plassans sleeps while Paris fights. But though on the surface the town may appear calm and indifferent, in the depths hidden work goes on which it is curious to study. If shots are rare in the streets, intrigues consume the drawing-rooms of both the new town and the Saint-Marc quarter. Until the year 1830 the masses were reckoned of no account. Even at the present time they are similarly ignored. Everything is settled between the clergy, the nobility, and the bourgeoisie. The priests, who are very numerous, give the cue to the local politics; they lay subterranean mines, as it were, and deal blows in the dark, following a prudent tactical system, which hardly allows of a step in advance or retreat even in the course of ten years. The secret intrigues of men who desire above all things to avoid noise requires special shrewdness, a special aptitude for dealing with small matters, and a patient endurance such as one only finds in persons callous to all passions. It is thus that provincial dilatoriness, which is so freely ridiculed in Paris, is full of treachery, secret stabs, hidden victories and defeats. These worthy men, particularly when their interests are at stake, kill at home with a snap of the fingers, as we, the Parisians, kill with cannon in the public thoroughfares.","IN the closed, isolated town of Plassans, where class divisions were so clearly marked in 1848, the impact of distant political events was very slight. Even today the voice of the people is hardly heard there; the bourgeoisie shows its usual prudence, the nobility its silent despair, and the clergy its shrewd cunning. Kings may usurp thrones, republics may be established, but the town scarcely stirs. Plassans sleeps while Paris fights. But though on the surface the town may appear calm and indifferent, in its depths there is secret activity which is interesting to study. If gunfire is rarely heard in the streets, intrigues dominate the drawing-rooms of both the new town and the Saint-Marc quarter. Until 1830 the common people were reckoned of no account. Even now it is as if they did not exist. Everything is settled between the clergy, the nobility, and the bourgeoisie. The priests, who are very numerous, set the tone of local politics: they lay underground mines, so to speak, and deal blows in the dark, following a clever, cautious tactical system that hardly allows for a step forward or backwards even in the course of ten years. The secret intrigues of men for whom discretion is paramount require a special shrewdness, a special aptitude for dealing with trivia, and the patience you find only in people devoid of passion. These worthy men, particularly when their interests are at stake, kill at home with a click of the fingers, just as we, in Paris, kill with cannon in public thoroughfares."

"La veille du jour où il arrêta Eugène sur le cours Sauvaire, il avait publié, dans l’Indépendant, un article terrible sur les menées du clergé, en réponse à un entrefilet de Vuillet, qui accusait les républicains de vouloir démolir les églises.

En province, où l’on cultive encore la périphrase, la polémique met le catéchisme poissard en beau langage : Aristide appelait son adversaire « frère Judas », ou encore « serviteur de saint Antoine », et Vuillet répondait galamment en traitant le républicain de « monstre gorgé de sang dont la guillotine était l’ignoble pourvoyeuse ».","The day before he arrested Eugène on the Cours Sauvaire, he had published a terrible article in the Indépendant on the intrigues of the clergy, in response to a paragraph from Vuillet, who accused the Republicans of wanting to demolish the churches.

In the provinces, where circumlocutions are still cultivated, the polemic puts the poissard catechism in beautiful language: Aristide called his adversary ""brother Judas"", or even ""servant of Saint Anthony"", and Vuillet gallantly replied by treating the Republican as "" blood-soaked monster of which the guillotine was the ignoble purveyor”.","On the evening prior to the day when he stopped Eugène on the Cours Sauvaire, he had published, in the “Indépendant,” a terrible article on the intrigues of the clergy, in response to a short paragraph from Vuillet, who had accused the Republicans of desiring to demolish the churches.

In the provinces, where a periphrastic style is still cultivated, polemics are clothed in high-sounding phrases. Aristide called his adversary “brother Judas,” or “slave of Saint-Anthony.” Vuillet gallantly retorted by terming the Republican “a monster glutted with blood whose ignoble purveyor was the guillotine.”","The day before he ran into Eugène on the Cours Sauvaire he had published in L’Indépendant a terrible article on the intrigues of the clergy, in response to a paragraph from Vuillet, who had accused the republicans of wanting to demolish the churches.

"Vers une heure, les trois mille hommes, accroupis à terre, tenant leurs armes entre leurs jambes, mangeaient. La place du Marché et celle de l’Hôtel-de-Ville étaient transformées en de vastes réfectoires. Malgré le froid vif, il y avait des traînées de gaieté dans cette foule grouillante, dont les clartés vives de la lune dessinaient vivement les moindres groupes. Les pauvres affamés dévoraient joyeusement leur part, en soufflant dans leurs doigts ; et, du fond des rues voisines, où l’on distinguait de vagues formes noires assises sur le seuil blanc des maisons, venaient aussi des rires brusques qui coulaient de l’ombre et se perdaient dans la grande cohue. Aux fenêtres, les curieuses enhardies, des bonnes femmes coiffées de foulards, regardaient manger ces terribles insurgés, ces buveurs de sang allant à tour de rôle boire à la pompe du marché, dans le creux de leur main.","About one o'clock the three thousand men, squatting on the ground, holding their arms between their legs, were eating. The Place du Marché and the Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville were transformed into vast refectories. Despite the sharp cold, there were streaks of gaiety in this teeming crowd, whose bright moonlight drew the smallest groups vividly. The starving poor merrily devoured their share, blowing into their fingers; and from the depths of the neighboring streets, where one could make out vague black shapes seated on the white thresholds of the houses, there also came sudden laughter which flowed from the shadows and were lost in the great crowd. At the windows, the curious, emboldened, good women wearing headscarves, watched these terrible insurgents eat, these blood drinkers going in turn to drink from the market pump, in the hollow of their hands.","Towards one o’clock the three thousand men began to eat, squatting on the ground, with their weapons between their legs. The market-place and the neighbourhood of the town-hall were turned into vast open-air refectories.

"– C’est pour cela que vous me dérangez ? répondit Vuillet avec colère. Parbleu ! la Gazette n’a pas paru ; je n’ai pas envie de me faire massacrer demain, si les insurgés reviennent. »","""Is that why you're bothering me?"" replied Vuillet angrily.

"Dans les rues, ils s’avancèrent le long des maisons, muets, sur une seule file, comme des sauvages qui partent pour la guerre. Rougon avait tenu à honneur de marcher en tête ; l’heure était venue où il devait payer de sa personne, s’il voulait le succès de ses plans ; il avait des gouttes de sueur au front, malgré le froid, mais il gardait une allure très martiale. Derrière lui, venaient immédiatement Roudier et Granoux. À deux reprises, la colonne s’arrêta net ; elle avait cru entendre des bruits lointains de bataille ; ce n’était que les petits plats à barbe de cuivre, pendus par des chaînettes, qui servent d’enseigne aux perruquiers du Midi, et que des souffles de vent agitaient. Après chaque halte, les sauveurs de Plassans reprenaient leur marche prudente dans le noir, avec leur allure de héros effarouchés. Ils arrivèrent ainsi sur la place de l’Hôtel-de-Ville. Là, ils se groupèrent autour de Rougon, délibérant une fois de plus. En face d’eux, sur la façade noire de la mairie, une seule fenêtre était éclairée. Il était près de sept heures, le jour allait paraître.","In the streets, they advanced along the houses, mute, in single file, like savages leaving for war. Rougon had made it a point of honor to march in front; the hour had come when he had to pay with himself, if he wanted the success of his plans; he had beads of sweat on his forehead, despite the cold, but he still looked very martial. Behind him immediately came Roudier and Granoux. Twice the column stopped short; she thought she heard distant sounds of battle; it was only the little copper shaving dishes, hung by chains, which serve as signs for the wigmakers of the South, and which were shaken by the gusts of wind. After each halt, the saviors of Plassans resumed their cautious march in the dark, looking like frightened heroes. They thus arrived at the Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville. There they gathered around Rougon, deliberating once more. Opposite them, on the black facade of the town hall, a single window was lit. It was nearly seven o'clock, day was about to dawn.","In the streets they kept close to the houses, marching silently and in single file, like savages on the war-path. Rougon had insisted upon having the honour of marching at their head; the time had come when he must needs run some risk, if he wanted to see his schemes successful. Drops of perspiration poured down his forehead in spite of the cold. Nevertheless he preserved a very martial bearing. Roudier and Granoux were immediately behind him. Upon two occasions the column came to an abrupt halt. They fancied they had heard some distant sound of fighting; but it was only the jingle of the little brass shaving-dishes hanging from chains, which are used as signs by the barbers of Southern France. These dishes were gently shaking to and fro in the breeze. After each halt, the saviours of Plassans continued their stealthy march in the dark, retaining the while the mien of terrified heroes. In this manner they reached the square in front of the Town Hall. There they formed a group round Rougon, and took counsel together once more. In the façade of the building in front of them only one window was lighted. It was now nearly seven o’clock and the dawn was approaching.","In the streets they kept close to the houses, walking in silence and in single file like savages on the warpath.

"« Assez causé, dit-il brusquement. Il est tard, dormons. Ça nous portera malheur de faire des calculs à l’avance. Je ne tiens pas encore la place. Surtout, sois discrète. »","""Enough talk,"" he said abruptly. It's late, let's sleep. It will be bad luck for us to make calculations in advance. I don't hold the place yet.

"Ces mots, accompagnés d’un ricanement, firent courir un frisson froid dans le dos de Félicité. Mais elle était femme de tête, et la vue des beaux rideaux de M. Peirotte, qu’elle regardait religieusement chaque matin, entretenait son courage. Quand elle se sentait faiblir, elle se mettait à la fenêtre et contemplait la maison du receveur.

"Comme Silvère atteignait sa seizième année, Macquart le fit initier à la société secrète des Montagnards, cette association puissante qui couvrait tout le Midi. Dès ce moment, le jeune républicain couva des yeux la carabine du contrebandier, qu’Adélaïde avait accrochée sur le manteau de la cheminée. Une nuit, pendant que sa grand-mère dormait, il la nettoya, la remit en état. Puis il la replaça à son clou et attendit. Et il se berçait dans ses rêveries d’illuminé, il bâtissait des épopées gigantesques, voyant en plein idéal des luttes homériques, des sortes de tournois chevaleresques, dont les défenseurs de la liberté sortaient vainqueurs, et acclamés par le monde entier.","As Silvere reached his sixteenth year, Macquart had him initiated into the secret society of the Montagnards, that powerful association which covered the whole of the South. From that moment the young Republican looked down at the smuggler's carbine, which Adelaide had hung on the mantelpiece. One night, while his grandmother slept, he cleaned it, restored it. Then he replaced it on its nail and waited.

"Celle-ci eût vécu parfaitement heureuse, sous la protection secrète de sa tante Eulalie, sans les taquineries de son cousin, alors âgé de seize ans, qui occupait ses paresses à la détester et à la persécuter sourdement. Les meilleures heures de Justin étaient celles où il parvenait à la faire gronder par quelque rapport gros de mensonges. Quand il pouvait lui marcher sur les pieds ou la pousser avec brutalité, en feignant de ne pas l’avoir aperçue, il riait, il goûtait cette volupté sournoise des gens qui jouissent béatement du mal des autres. Miette le regardait alors, avec ses grands yeux noirs d’enfant, d’un regard luisant de colère et de fierté muette, qui arrêtait les ricanements du lâche galopin. Au fond, il avait une peur atroce de sa cousine.","She would have lived perfectly happy, under the secret protection of her aunt Eulalie, without the teasing of her cousin, then sixteen years old, who occupied his idleness in detesting and secretly persecuting her.

When he could step on her toes or push her roughly, pretending not to have seen her, he laughed, he tasted that sly voluptuousness of people who blissfully enjoy the evil of others. Miette looked at him then, with her big black child's eyes, with a look shining with anger and silent pride, which stopped the cowardly urchin's giggles. Deep down, he was horribly afraid of his cousin.","The latter would have lived in perfect happiness under the secret protection of her aunt Eulalie, but for the teasing of her cousin, who was then a lad of sixteen, and employed his idle hours in hating and persecuting her.

Whenever he could tread on her feet, or push her roughly, pretending not to have seen her, he laughed and felt the delight of those crafty folks who rejoice at other people’s misfortunes.

In reality he was terribly afraid of his cousin.","Miette would have lived in perfect happiness under the secret protection of her Aunt Eulalie but for the teasing of her cousin, who was then sixteen and spent his spare time finding ways to torment her.

"Pierre retourna à la mairie, un peu ragaillardi. Il lui fallut du courage pour rester ferme au milieu des doléances de ses collègues. Les membres de la commission provisoire rapportaient dans leurs vêtements la panique, comme on rapporte avec soi une odeur de pluie, par les temps d’orage. Tous prétendaient avoir compté sur l’envoi d’un régiment, et ils s’exclamaient, en disant qu’on n’abandonnait pas de la sorte de braves citoyens aux fureurs de la démagogie. Pierre, pour avoir la paix, leur promit presque leur régiment pour le lendemain. Puis il déclara avec solennité qu’il allait faire fermer les portes. Ce fut un soulagement. Des gardes nationaux durent se rendre immédiatement à chaque porte, avec ordre de donner un double tour aux serrures. Quand ils furent de retour, plusieurs membres avouèrent qu’ils étaient vraiment plus tranquilles ; et lorsque Pierre eut dit que la situation critique de la ville leur faisait un devoir de rester à leur poste, il y en eut qui prirent leurs petites dispositions pour passer la nuit dans un fauteuil. Granoux mit une calotte de soie noire, qu’il avait apportée par précaution. Vers onze heures, la moitié de ces messieurs dormaient autour du bureau de M. Garçonnet. Ceux qui tenaient encore les yeux ouverts faisaient le rêve, en écoutant les pas cadencés des gardes nationaux, sonnant dans la cour, qu’ils étaient des braves et qu’on les décorait. Une grande lampe, posée sur le bureau, éclairait cette étrange veillée d’armes. Rougon, qui semblait sommeiller, se leva brusquement et envoya chercher Vuillet. Il venait de se rappeler qu’il n’avait point reçu la Gazette.","Pierre returned to the town hall, a little cheered up. It took courage to stand firm amid the grievances of his colleagues. The members of the Provisional Commission carried panic in their clothes, as one carries with him the smell of rain in stormy weather. All claimed to have counted on the sending of a regiment, and they exclaimed, saying that they did not abandon brave citizens in this way to the fury of demagoguery. Pierre, to have peace, almost promised them their regiment for the next day. Then he solemnly declared that he was going to close the doors. It was a relief. National Guardsmen had to go immediately to each door, with orders to give the locks a double turn. When they returned, several members confessed that they were much calmer; and when Pierre had said that the critical situation of the city made it a duty for them to remain at their post, there were some who made their little arrangements to pass the night in an armchair. Granoux put on a skullcap of black silk, which he had brought as a precaution. About eleven o'clock, half of these gentlemen were asleep around M. Garçonnet's desk. Those who still kept their eyes open dreamed, listening to the cadenced footsteps of the National Guards ringing in the courtyard, that they were brave and that they were being decorated. A large lamp, placed on the desk, lit up this strange vigil of arms. Rougon, who seemed to be dozing, rose abruptly and sent for Vuillet. He had just remembered that he had not received the Gazette.","Pierre returned to the town-hall in rather more cheerful spirits. He required some courage to remain firm amidst the woeful maunderings of his colleagues. The members of the Provisional Commission seemed to reek with panic, just as they might with damp in the rainy season. They all professed to have counted upon the despatch of a regiment, and began to exclaim that brave citizens ought not to be abandoned in such a manner to the fury of the rabble. Pierre, to preserve peace, almost promised they should have a regiment on the morrow. Then he announced, in a solemn manner, that he was going to have the gates closed. This came as a relief. Detachments of the national guards had to repair immediately to each gate and double-lock it. When they had returned, several members confessed that they really felt more comfortable; and when Pierre remarked that the critical situation of the town imposed upon them the duty of remaining at their posts, some of them made arrangements with the view of spending the night in an arm-chair. Granoux put on a black silk skull cap which he had brought with him by way of precaution. Towards eleven o’clock, half of the gentlemen were sleeping round Monsieur Garconnet’s writing table. Those who still managed to keep their eyes open fancied, as they listened to the measured tramp of the national guards in the courtyard, that they were heroes and were receiving decorations. A large lamp, placed on the writing-table, illumined this strange vigil. All at once, however, Rougon, who had seemed to be slumbering, jumped up, and sent for Vuillet.

"« M’ont-ils laissé commettre assez de bêtises, murmurait-il en courant. Je suis un joli monsieur, maintenant. Ah ! quelle école ! Granoux est plus fort que moi. »","""Did they let me do enough nonsense?"" he whispered as he ran. I'm a nice gentleman now. Ah! which school !

Granoux is more capable than I.”","‘They have let me do a lot of stupid things,’ he muttered as he ran. ‘I’m in a fine mess now. What a lesson! Granoux is cleverer than I am.’"
"Et il ajouta, avec le sourire sceptique du gentilhomme encanaillé :","And he added, with the skeptical smile of a cantankerous gentleman:","And he added, with the sceptical smile of a nobleman who has lost caste: “Pshaw!","And he added, with the wry smile of a nobleman who has come down in the world:"
"« Plus bas donc, monsieur ! vous allez nous faire massacrer. »","“Down, sir! you are going to kill us. »","Monsieur Peirotte, as white as a sheet, remained silent; he only opened his lips once, to say to Sicardot, who was still bitterly railing: “Not so loud, sir; not so loud!

"« Tout dépend des événements, répondit le petit vieillard. Si le département reste calme, si quelque insurrection ne vient pas effrayer Plassans, il vous sera difficile de vous mettre en vue et de rendre des services au gouvernement nouveau. Je vous conseille alors de rester chez vous et d’attendre en paix les bienfaits de votre fils Eugène. Mais si le peuple se lève et que nos braves bourgeois se croient menacés, il y aura un bien joli rôle à jouer… Ton mari est un peu épais…","“It all depends on events,” replied the little old man. If the department remains calm, if some insurrection does not come to frighten Plassans, it will be difficult for you to put yourself in sight and render service to the new government.

But if the people rise up and our brave bourgeois believe they are threatened, there will be a very nice role to play... Your husband is a little thick...","“It all depends upon circumstances,” the little old man replied. “If the department remains quiet, if no insurrection occurs to terrify Plassans, it will be difficult for you to make yourselves conspicuous and render any services to the new government. I advise you, in that case, to remain at home, and peacefully await the bounties of your son Eugène. But if the people rise, and our brave bourgeois think themselves in danger, there will be a fine part to play. Your husband is somewhat heavy—”","‘It all depends on the situation,’ the little old man replied. ‘If the department is unaffected, if there is no insurrection that might throw Plassans into chaos, it will be hard for you to make yourselves stand out and be useful to the new government. In that case, my advice is that you should do nothing, and wait for the benefits you will receive from your son Eugène. But if the people rise up, and our brave bourgeois feel threatened, then you will have a wonderful part to play... Your husband is rather slow to see these things...’"
"Quelques mois avant le coup d’État, les Rougon reçurent une lettre anonyme, trois pages d’ignobles injures, au milieu desquelles on les menaçait, si jamais leur parti triomphait, de publier dans un journal l’histoire scandaleuse des anciennes amours d’Adélaïde et du vol dont Pierre s’était rendu coupable, en faisant signer un reçu de cinquante mille francs à sa mère, rendue idiote par la débauche.

"Avant d’atteindre l’allée, Silvère regarda. Il se souvint d’un dimanche lointain où, par un beau clair de lune, il avait traversé le chantier. Quelle douceur attendrie ! comme les rayons pâles coulaient lentement le long des madriers ! Du ciel glacé tombait un silence souverain. Et, dans ce silence, la bohémienne aux cheveux crépus chantait à voix basse dans une langue inconnue. Puis, Silvère se rappela que ce dimanche lointain datait de huit jours. Il y avait huit jours qu’il était venu dire adieu à Miette. Que cela était loin ! Il lui semblait qu’il n’avait plus mis les pieds dans le chantier depuis des années. Mais quand il entra dans l’allée étroite, son cœur défaillit. Il reconnaissait l’odeur des herbes, les ombres des planches, les trous de la muraille. Une voix éplorée monta de toutes ces choses. L’allée s’allongeait, triste, vide ; elle lui parut plus longue ; il y sentit souffler un vent froid. Ce coin avait cruellement vieilli. Il vit le mur rongé de mousse, le tapis d’herbe brûlé par la gelée, les tas de planches pourries par les eaux. C’était une désolation. Le crépuscule jaune tombait comme une boue fine sur les ruines de ses chères tendresses. Il dut fermer les yeux, et il revit l’allée verte, les saisons heureuses se déroulèrent. Il faisait tiède, il courait dans l’air chaud, avec Miette. Puis les pluies de décembre tombaient, rudes, sans fin ; ils venaient toujours, ils se cachaient au fond des planches, ils écoutaient, ravis, le grand ruissellement de l’averse. Ce fut, dans un éclair, toute sa vie, toute sa joie qui passa. Miette sautait son mur, elle accourait, secouée de rires sonores. Elle était là, il voyait sa blancheur dans l’ombre, avec son casque vivant, sa chevelure d’encre. Elle parlait des nids de pies, qui sont si difficiles à dénicher, et elle l’entraînait. Alors, il entendit au loin les murmures adoucis de la Viorne, le chant des cigales attardées, le vent qui soufflait dans les peupliers des prés Sainte-Claire. Comme ils avaient couru pourtant ! Il se souvenait bien. Elle avait appris à nager en quinze jours. C’était une brave enfant. Elle n’avait qu’un gros défaut : elle maraudait. Mais il l’aurait corrigée. La pensée de leurs premières caresses le ramena à l’allée étroite. Toujours ils étaient revenus dans ce trou. Il crut saisir le chant mourant de la bohémienne, le claquement des derniers volets, l’heure grave qui tombait des horloges. Puis le moment de la séparation sonnait, Miette remontait sur son mur. Elle lui envoyait des baisers. Et il ne la voyait plus. Une émotion terrible le prit à la gorge : il ne la verrait plus jamais, jamais.","Before reaching the driveway, Silvere looked. He remembered a distant Sunday when, by a beautiful moonlight, he had crossed the building site. What tender sweetness! how the pale rays flowed slowly along the planks! From the icy sky fell a sovereign silence. And, in this silence, the gypsy with frizzy hair sang in a low voice in an unknown language. Then Silvere remembered that that distant Sunday dated back eight days. It had been a week since he had come to say good-bye to Miette. How far was that! It seemed to him that he hadn't set foot in the building site for years. But when he entered the narrow aisle, his heart sank. He recognized the smell of grass, the shadows of the planks, the holes in the wall. A tearful voice rose from all these things. The path lengthened, sad, empty; it seemed to him longer; he felt a cold wind blowing there. This corner had aged cruelly. He saw the moss-eaten wall, the carpet of frost-scorched grass, the heaps of planks rotted by the water. It was a desolation. The yellow twilight fell like a fine mud on the ruins of her dear tenderness. He had to close his eyes, and he saw the green path again, the happy seasons unfolded. It was lukewarm, he was running in the hot air, with Miette. Then the December rains fell, harsh, endless; they always came, they hid themselves at the bottom of the planks, they listened, delighted, to the great trickling of the downpour. It was, in a flash, all his life, all his joy that passed away. Miette jumped her wall, she ran up, shaken by sonorous laughter. She was there, he saw her whiteness in the shadows, with her living helmet, her inky hair. She was talking about crows' nests, which are so hard to find, and she was leading him on. Then he heard in the distance the soft murmurs of the Viorne, the song of the lingering cicadas, the wind blowing in the poplars of the Sainte-Claire meadows. Yet how they had run! He remembered well. She had learned to swim in two weeks. She was a brave child. She had only one big flaw: she marauded. But he would have fixed it. The thought of their first caresses brought him back to the narrow aisle. They had always come back to this hole. He thought he caught the dying song of the gypsy, the banging of the last shutters, the grave hour falling from the clocks. Then the moment of separation sounded, Miette went back up on her wall. She was sending him kisses. And he no longer saw her. A terrible emotion seized him by the throat: he would never see her again, never.","Before reaching the secluded path, Silvère looked round him. He bethought himself of a far away Sunday when he had crossed the wood-yard in the bright moonlight. How calm and soft it had been!—how slowly had the pale rays passed over the beams! Supreme silence had fallen from the frozen sky. And amidst this silence, the woolly-haired gipsy girl had sung in a low key and an unknown tongue. Then Silvère remembered that the seemingly far-off Sunday was only a week old. But a week ago he had come to bid Miette farewell! How long past it seemed! He felt as though he had not set foot in the wood-yard for years. But when he reached the narrow path his heart failed him. He recognised the odour of the grass, the shadows of the planks, the holes in the wall. A woeful voice rose from all those things. The path stretched out sad and lonely; it seemed longer to him than usual, and he felt a cold wind blowing down it. The spot had aged cruelly. He saw that the wall was moss-eaten, that the verdant carpet was dried up by frost, that the piles of timber had been rotted by rain. It was perfect devastation. The yellow twilight fell like fine dust upon the ruins of all that had been most dear to him. He was obliged to close his eyes that he might again behold the lane green, and live his happy hours afresh. It was warm weather; and he was racing with Miette in the balmy air. Then the cruel December rains fell unceasingly, yet they still came there, sheltering themselves beneath the planks and listening with rapture to the heavy plashing of the shower. His whole life—all his happiness—passed before him like a flash of lightning. Miette was climbing over the wall, running to him, shaking with sonorous laughter. She was there; he could see her, gleaming white through the darkness, with her living helm of ink-black hair. She was talking about the magpies’ nests, which are so difficult to steal, and she dragged him along with her. Then he heard the gentle murmur of the Viorne in the distance, the chirping of the belated grasshoppers, and the blowing of the breeze among the poplars in the meadows of Sainte-Claire. Ah, how they used to run! How well he remembered it! She had learnt to swim in a fortnight. She was a plucky girl. She had only had one great fault: she was inclined to pilfering. But he would have cured her of that. Then the thought of their first embraces brought him back to the narrow path. They had always ended by returning to that nook. He fancied he could hear the gipsy girl’s song dying away, the creaking of the last shutters, the solemn striking of the clocks. Then the hour of separation came, and Miette climbed the wall again and threw him a kiss. And he saw her no more. Emotion choked him at the thought: he would never see her again—never!","Before reaching the little lane, Silvère looked round. He remembered a far-off Sunday when he had crossed the woodyard in the bright moonlight. How calm and peaceful it had been. How slowly the pale rays of light had spread over the beams. A majestic silence had fallen from the frozen sky. And amidst this silence the frizzyhaired gypsy sang in a low key and an unknown tongue. Then Silvère remembered that the far-off Sunday was just a week old. A week ago he had come to bid Miette farewell! How long ago it seemed! He felt as if he had not set foot in the woodyard for years. But when he reached the little lane his heart nearly stopped. He recognized the smell of the grass, the shadows of the planks, the holes in the wall. It all looked so desolate now. The lane stretched out, sad and lonely; it seemed longer than before, and he felt a cold wind blowing down it. The spot had grown terribly old. He saw that the wall was moss-eaten, that the grass was destroyed by frost, that the piles of timber had begun to rot because of the rain. It was a picture of desolation. The yellow twilight fell like fine dust on the ruins of everything that had been most dear to him. He had to shut his eyes so that he could see the lane green again, and relive the happy times he had spent there. It was warm weather, and he was running with Miette in the balmy air. Then the cruel December rains fell endlessly; yet they still came, sheltering under the planks and listening in delight to the gushing rain. His whole life — every moment of happiness — flashed before him. Miette was climbing over the wall, running towards him, shaking with laughter. She was there; he could see her, shining in the darkness, with her living headdress of ink-black hair. She was talking about the magpies’ nests, which are so difficult to dislodge, and she was dragging him along with her. Then he heard the gentle murmur of the Viorne in the distance, the chirping of the last cicadas, and the breeze blowing through the poplars in the meadows of Sainte-Claire. How they used to run! How clearly he remembered everything! She had learnt to swim in two weeks. She was such a fine girl. She had just one fault: she pilfered things. But he would have cured her of that.

"Et comme Silvère serrait les poings, plus pâle et plus frémissant qu’elle :","And as Silvere clenched his fists, paler and more quivering than she:","And as Silvère, pale and trembling more than she, began to clench his fists: “Stop!”","Silvère, paler and trembling even more than Miette, clenched his fists, but she continued:"

"Enfin, Pierre Rougon était seul maître au logis. L’enclos des Fouque lui appartenait en fait, sinon légalement. Jamais il n’avait compté s’y établir. C’était un champ trop étroit pour son ambition. Travailler à la terre, soigner des légumes, lui semblait grossier, indigne de ses facultés. Il avait hâte de n’être plus un paysan. Sa nature, affinée par le tempérament nerveux de sa mère, éprouvait des besoins irrésistibles de jouissances bourgeoises. Aussi, dans chacun de ses calculs, avait-il vu, comme dénouement, la vente de l’enclos des Fouque. Cette vente, en lui mettant dans les mains une somme assez ronde, devait lui permettre d’épouser la fille de quelque négociant qui le prendrait comme associé. En ce temps-là, les guerres de l’Empire éclaircissaient singulièrement les rangs des jeunes hommes à marier. Les parents se montraient moins difficiles dans le choix d’un gendre. Pierre se disait que l’argent arrangerait tout, et qu’on passerait aisément sur les commérages du faubourg ; il entendait se poser en victime, en brave cœur qui souffre des hontes de sa famille, qui les déplore, sans en être atteint et sans les excuser. Depuis plusieurs mois, il avait jeté ses vues sur la fille d’un marchand d’huile, Félicité Puech. La maison Puech et Lacamp, dont les magasins se trouvaient dans une des ruelles les plus noires du vieux quartier, était loin de prospérer. Elle avait un crédit douteux sur la place, on parlait vaguement de faillite. Ce fut justement à cause de ces mauvais bruits que Rougon dressa ses batteries de ce côté. Jamais un commerçant à son aise ne lui eût donné sa fille. Il comptait arriver lorsque le vieux Puech ne saurait plus par où passer, lui acheter Félicité et relever ensuite la maison par son intelligence et son énergie. C’était une façon habile de gravir un échelon, de s’élever d’un cran au-dessus de sa classe. Il voulait, avant tout, fuir cet affreux faubourg où l’on clabaudait sur sa famille, faire oublier les sales légendes, en effaçant jusqu’au nom de l’enclos des Fouque. Aussi les rues puantes du vieux quartier lui semblaient-elles un paradis. Là seulement il devait faire peau neuve.","Finally, Pierre Rougon was sole master of the house. The Fouque enclosure belonged to him in fact, if not legally. He had never intended to settle there. It was too narrow a field for his ambition. To work on the land, tending vegetables, seemed to him rude, unworthy of his faculties. He was in a hurry to no longer be a peasant. His nature, refined by the nervous temperament of his mother, felt irresistible needs for bourgeois pleasures. Also, in each of his calculations, he had seen, as a denouement, the sale of the Fouque enclosure. This sale, by putting in his hands a fairly round sum, was to enable him to marry the daughter of some merchant who would take him on as a partner. At that time, the wars of the Empire singularly thinned the ranks of young men to be married. Parents were less picky about choosing a son-in-law. Pierre said to himself that money would settle everything, and that they would easily pass over the gossip of the faubourg; he intended to pose as a victim, as a brave soul who suffers from the shame of his family, who deplores them, without being touched by them and without excusing them. For several months, he had cast his sights on the daughter of an oil merchant, Félicité Puech. The Puech et Lacamp house, whose stores were in one of the blackest alleys of the old quarter, was far from prospering. She had questionable credit locally, there was vague talk of bankruptcy. It was precisely because of these bad noises that Rougon drew up his batteries in that direction. Never had a wealthy tradesman given him his daughter. He intended to arrive when old Puech no longer knew where to go, to buy Felicite from him and then to restore the house with his intelligence and his energy. It was a clever way to climb a rung, to rise a notch above one's class. He wanted, above all, to flee this dreadful suburb where people were gossiping about his family, to make people forget the dirty legends, by erasing even the name of the Fouque enclosure. So the stinking streets of the old quarter seemed like a paradise to him. There only he had to make new skin.","Pierre was at last sole master of the house. The Fouques’ land belonged to him in fact, if not in law. He never thought of establishing himself on it. It was too narrow a field for his ambition. To till the ground and cultivate vegetables seemed to him boorish, unworthy of his faculties. He was in a hurry to divest himself of everything recalling the peasant. With his nature refined by his mother’s nervous temperament, he felt an irresistible longing for the enjoyments of the middle classes. In all his calculations, therefore, he had regarded the sale of the Fouques’ property as the final consummation. This sale, by placing a round sum of money in his hands, would enable him to marry the daughter of some merchant who would take him into partnership. At this period the wars of the First Empire were greatly thinning the ranks of eligible young men. Parents were not so fastidious as previously in the choice of a son-in-law. Pierre persuaded himself that money would smooth all difficulties, and that the gossip of the Faubourg would be overlooked; he intended to pose as a victim, as an honest man suffering from a family disgrace, which he deplored, without being soiled by it or excusing it. For several months already he had cast his eyes on a certain Félicité Puech, the daughter of an oil-dealer. The firm of Puech & Lacamp, whose warehouses were in one of the darkest lanes of the old quarter, was far from prosperous. It enjoyed but doubtful credit in the market, and people talked vaguely of bankruptcy. It was precisely in consequence of these evil reports that Pierre turned his batteries in this direction. No well-to-do trader would have given him his daughter. He meant to appear on the scene at the very moment when old Puech should no longer know which way to turn; he would then purchase Félicité of him, and re-establish the credit of the house by his own energy and intelligence. It was a clever expedient for ascending the first rung of the social ladder, for raising himself above his station. Above all things, he wished to escape from that frightful Faubourg where everybody reviled his family, and to obliterate all these foul legends, by effacing even the very name of the Fouques’ enclosure. For that reason the filthy streets of the old quarter seemed to him perfect paradise. There, only, he would be able to change his skin.","Pierre was at last sole master of the house. The Fouques’ property now belonged to him in fact, if not in law. He had never thought of establishing himself on it. It was too narrow a field for his ambition. To till the ground and cultivate vegetables seemed vulgar, unworthy of his capacities. He was in a hurry to leave his peasant background behind him. With his nature refined by his mother’s nervous temperament, he felt an irresistible desire for the pleasures of bourgeois life. In all his calculations, therefore, he had regarded the sale of the Fouques’ land as the supreme goal. This sale, by placing quite a substantial sum in his hands, would enable him to marry the daughter of some merchant who would take him into a partnership.

"Une de ses plus délicates jouissances fut de passer dix fois par jour devant le magasin de Pierre. Il agrandissait les trous de la veste avec les doigts, il ralentissait le pas, se mettait parfois à causer devant la porte, pour rester davantage dans la rue. Ces jours-là, il emmenait quelque ivrogne de ses amis, qui lui servait de compère ; il lui racontait le vol des cinquante mille francs, accompagnant son récit d’injures et de menaces, à voix haute, de façon à ce que toute la rue l’entendît, et que ses gros mots allassent à leur adresse, jusqu’au fond de la boutique.","One of his finest pleasures was to pass Pierre's shop ten times a day. He enlarged the holes in the jacket with his fingers, he slowed his pace, sometimes began to chat in front of the door, to stay longer in the street. On those days he took along some drunkard of his friends, who served as his accomplice; he told her of the theft of the fifty thousand francs, accompanying his story with insults and threats, in a loud voice, so that the whole street could hear him, and his swear words went to their address, right to the bottom. of the shop.","One of his most exquisite pleasures was to pass Pierre’s shop ten times a day.

"– Eh ! dit l’ancien marchand d’huile, ça ne me regarde pas. Eugène se charge de tout. Il me fera avancer le cautionnement par un banquier de Paris… Tu comprends, j’ai choisi une place qui rapporte gros. Eugène a commencé par faire la grimace. Il me disait qu’il fallait être riche pour occuper ces positions-là, qu’on choisissait d’habitude des gens influents. J’ai tenu bon, et il a cédé. Pour être receveur, on n’a pas besoin de savoir le latin ni le grec ; j’aurai, comme M. Peirotte, un fondé de pouvoir qui fera toute la besogne. »","– Hey! said the former oil merchant, that doesn't concern me. Eugene takes care of everything. He will have me advance the surety by a banker in Paris… You understand, I have chosen a place that pays off big. Eugene began by grimacing.

Peirotte, an attorney who will do all the work. »","“Eh!” said the retired oil-dealer, “that’s nothing to do with me; Eugène will see to that. He will get the money advanced by a banker in Paris. You see, I selected an appointment bringing in a good income. Eugène at first made a wry face, saying one must be rich to occupy such posts, to which influential men were usually nominated. I persisted, however, and he yielded. To be a receiver of taxes one need not know either Greek or Latin. I shall have a representative, like Monsieur Peirotte, and he will do all the work.”","‘Well,’ said the retired oil-dealer, ‘that’s not my concern. Eugène will take care of all that.

"Pendant deux années, ils vinrent là chaque jour. Ils y jouirent, lors de leurs premiers rendez-vous, de quelques belles nuits encore toutes tièdes.

"Silvère trébucha. Il regarda à ses pieds. Un fragment de crâne blanchissait dans l’herbe. Il crut entendre l’allée étroite s’emplir de voix. Les morts l’appelaient, les vieux morts, dont les haleines chaudes, pendant les soirées de juillet, les troublaient si étrangement, lui et son amoureuse. Il reconnaissait bien leurs murmures discrets. Ils étaient joyeux, ils lui disaient de venir, ils promettaient de lui rendre Miette dans la terre, dans une retraite encore plus cachée que ce bout de sentier. Le cimetière, qui avait soufflé au cœur des enfants, par ses odeurs grasses, par sa végétation noire, les âpres désirs, étalant avec complaisance son lit d’herbes folles, sans pouvoir les jeter aux bras l’un de l’autre, rêvait, à cette heure, de boire le sang chaud de Silvère. Depuis deux étés, il attendait les jeunes époux.","Silvere stumbled. He looked at his feet. A fragment of skull whitened in the grass. He thought he heard the narrow alley fill with voices. The dead were calling to him, the old dead, whose hot breaths, during July evenings, disturbed them so strangely, he and his lover. He recognized their discreet whispers well. They were happy, they told him to come, they promised to give him Crumb in the ground, in a retreat even more hidden than this end of the path. The cemetery, which had blown at the heart of the children, by its greasy odors, by its black vegetation, the harsh desires, spreading with complaisance its bed of wild grass, without being able to throw them into each other's arms, dreamed , at this hour, to drink the hot blood of Silvere. For two summers, he had been waiting for the newlyweds.","Silvère stumbled. He looked at his feet. A fragment of a skull lay whitening in the grass.

They were rejoicing, they were telling him to come, and promising to restore Miette to him beneath the earth, in some retreat which would prove still more sequestered than this old trysting-place. The cemetery, whose oppressive odours and dark vegetation had breathed eager desire into the children’s hearts, while alluringly spreading out its couches of rank grass, without succeeding however in throwing them into one another’s arms, now longed to imbibe Silvère’s warm blood.

"Bien qu’il eût renoncé à toute espérance personnelle, il n’en resta pas moins à Plassans jusqu’à la fin du mois, très assidu surtout aux réunions du salon jaune. Dès le premier coup de sonnette, il s’asseyait dans le creux d’une fenêtre, le plus loin possible de la lampe. Il demeurait là toute la soirée, le menton sur la paume de la main droite, écoutant religieusement. Les plus grosses niaiseries le laissaient impassible. Il approuvait tout de la tête, jusqu’aux grognements effarés de Granoux. Quand on lui demandait son avis, il répétait poliment l’opinion de la majorité. Rien ne parvint à lasser sa patience, ni les rêves creux du marquis qui parlait des Bourbons comme au lendemain de 1815, ni les effusions bourgeoises de Roudier, qui s’attendrissait en comptant le nombre de paires de chaussettes qu’il avait fournies jadis au roi citoyen. Au contraire, il paraissait fort à l’aise au milieu de cette tour de Babel. Parfois, quand tous ces grotesques tapaient à bras raccourcis sur la République, on voyait ses yeux rire sans que ses lèvres perdissent leur moue d’homme grave. Sa façon recueillie d’écouter, sa complaisance inaltérable lui avaient concilié toutes les sympathies. On le jugeait nul, mais bon enfant. Lorsqu’un ancien marchand d’huile ou d’amandes ne pouvait placer, au milieu du tumulte, de quelle façon il sauverait la France, s’il était le maître, il se réfugiait auprès d’Eugène et lui criait ses plans merveilleux à l’oreille. Eugène hochait doucement la tête, comme ravi des choses élevées qu’il entendait. Vuillet seul le regardait d’un air louche. Ce libraire, doublé d’un sacristain et d’un journaliste, parlant moins que les autres, observait davantage. Il avait remarqué que l’avocat causait parfois dans les coins avec le commandant Sicardot. Il se promit de les surveiller, mais il ne put jamais surprendre une seule de leurs paroles. Eugène faisait taire le commandant d’un clignement d’yeux, dès qu’il approchait. Sicardot, à partir de cette époque, ne parla plus des Napoléon qu’avec un mystérieux sourire.","Although he had given up all personal hopes, he nevertheless remained at Plassans until the end of the month, very assiduous, especially at the meetings in the yellow salon. At the first ring of the bell, he sat down in the hollow of a window, as far as possible from the lamp. He remained there all evening, his chin on the palm of his right hand, listening religiously. The biggest nonsense left him impassive. He approved of everything with his head, right down to Granoux's frightened grunts. When asked for his opinion, he politely repeated the opinion of the majority. Nothing succeeded in tiring his patience, neither the hollow dreams of the marquis who spoke of the Bourbons as in the aftermath of 1815, nor the bourgeois effusions of Roudier, who grew tender as he counted the number of pairs of socks he had once provided to the citizen king. On the contrary, he seemed very comfortable in the middle of this tower of Babel. Sometimes, when all these grotesques beat down on the Republic, you could see his eyes laughing without his lips losing their grave man's pout. His collected way of listening, his unalterable complacency had won him all sympathy. He was considered useless, but good-natured. When a former merchant of oil or almonds could not imagine, in the midst of the tumult, how he would save France, if he were the master, he took refuge with Eugene and cried out to him his marvelous plans for the ear. Eugene nodded gently, as if delighted with the lofty things he heard. Only Vuillet looked at him suspiciously. This bookseller, coupled with a sexton and a journalist, spoke less than the others, observed more. He had noticed that the lawyer sometimes chatted in corners with Commandant Sicardot. He promised himself to watch them, but he could never overhear a single word they said. Eugene silenced the Commandant with a blink of an eye as soon as he approached. Sicardot, from that time on, spoke of the Napoleons only with a mysterious smile.","Although he had renounced all hope for himself, he remained at Plassans until the end of the month, assiduously attending the meetings in the yellow drawing-room. As soon as the bell rang, announcing the first visitor, he would take up his position in one of the window recesses as far as possible from the lamp. And he remained there the whole evening, resting his chin on the palm of his right hand, and listening religiously. The greatest absurdities did not disturb his equanimity. He nodded approval even to the wild grunts of Granoux. When anyone asked him his own opinion, he politely repeated that of the majority. Nothing seemed to tire his patience, neither the hollow dreams of the marquis, who spoke of the Bourbons as if 1815 were a recent date, nor the effusions of citizen Roudier, who grew quite pathetic when he recounted how many pairs of socks he had supplied to the citizen king, Louis Philippe. On the contrary, he seemed quite at his ease in this Tower of Babel. Sometimes, when these grotesque personages were storming against the Republic, his eyes would smile, while his lips retained their expression of gravity. His meditative manner of listening, and his invariable complacency, had earned him the sympathy of everyone. He was considered a nonentity, but a very decent fellow. Whenever an old oil or almond dealer failed to get a hearing, amidst the clamour, for some plan by which he could save France if he were only a master, he took himself off to Eugène and shouted his marvellous suggestions in his ear. And Eugène gently nodded his head, as though delighted with the grand projects he was listening to. Vuillet, alone, regarded him with a suspicious eye. This bookseller, half-sacristan and half-journalist, spoke less than the others, but was more observant. He had noticed that Eugène occasionally conversed at times in a corner with Commander Sicardot. So he determined to watch them, but never succeeded in overhearing a word. Eugène silenced the commander by a wink whenever Vuillet approached them. From that time, Sicardot never spoke of the Napoleons without a mysterious smile.","Although he had given up all hope as a potential candidate, he remained in Plassans until the end of the month, regularly attending the meetings in the yellow drawing-room.

"Le puits mitoyen était un grand puits très peu profond. De chaque côté du mur, les margelles s’arrondissaient en un large demi-cercle. L’eau se trouvait à trois ou quatre mètres, au plus. Cette eau dormante reflétait les deux ouvertures du puits, deux demi-lunes que l’ombre de la muraille séparait d’une raie noire. En se penchant, on eût cru apercevoir, dans le jour vague, deux glaces d’une netteté et d’un éclat singuliers. Par les matinées de soleil, lorsque l’égouttement des cordes ne troublait pas la surface de l’eau, ces glaces, ces reflets du ciel se découpaient, blancs sur l’eau verte, en reproduisant avec une étrange exactitude les feuilles d’un pied de lierre qui avait poussé le long de la muraille, au-dessus du puits.","The adjoining well was a large, very shallow well. On each side of the wall, the copings rounded off in a wide semi-circle. The water was three or four meters away, at most. This still water reflected the two openings of the well, two half-moons separated by the shadow of the wall with a black streak. Leaning forward, you would have thought you could see, in the vague light, two mirrors of singular clarity and brilliance. On sunny mornings, when the dripping of the ropes did not disturb the surface of the water, these mirrors, these reflections of the sky stood out, white on the green water, reproducing with a strange precision the leaves of a ivy that had grown along the wall above the well.","The party-well was a large one, but not very deep. On either side of the wall the curb formed a large semicircle. The water was only ten or twelve feet down at the utmost. This slumbering water reflected the two apertures of the well, two half-moons between which the shadow of the wall cast a black streak. On leaning over, one might have fancied in the vague light that the half-moons were two mirrors of singular clearness and brilliance. Under the morning sunshine, when the dripping of the ropes did not disturb the surface of the water, these mirrors, these reflections of the heavens, showed like white patches on the green water, and in them the leaves of the ivy which had spread along the wall over the well were repeated with marvellous exactness.","The well was wide, but not very deep.

"Parfois encore, dans cette morte, dans cette vieille femme blême qui paraissait n’avoir plus une goutte de sang, des crises nerveuses passaient, comme des courants électriques, qui la galvanisaient et lui rendaient pour une heure une vie atroce d’intensité. Elle demeurait sur son lit, rigide, les yeux ouverts ; puis des hoquets la prenaient, et elle se débattait ; elle avait la force effrayante de ces folles hystériques, qu’on est obligé d’attacher, pour qu’elles ne se brisent pas la tête contre les murs. Ce retour à ses anciennes ardeurs, ces brusques attaques, secouaient d’une façon navrante son pauvre corps endolori. C’était comme toute sa jeunesse de passion chaude qui éclatait honteusement dans ses froideurs de sexagénaire. Quand elle se relevait, stupide, elle chancelait, elle reparaissait si effarée, que les commères du faubourg disaient : « Elle a bu, la vieille folle ! »","Sometimes still, in this dead woman, in this pallid old woman who seemed to have no longer a drop of blood, nervous crises passed, like electric currents, which galvanized her and restored to her for an hour an atrociously intense life.

This return to her former ardor, these sudden attacks, shook her poor aching body in a distressing way. It was like all his youth of hot passion bursting shamefully in his sexagenarian coldness. When she got up, stupid, she staggered, she reappeared so frightened that the gossips of the faubourg said: ""She's been drinking, the old madwoman!"" »","Sometimes, even now, this moribund, pale old woman, who seemed to have no blood left in her, was seized with nervous fits like electric shocks, which galvanised her, and for an hour brought her atrocious intensity of life.

"Ce furent les seules paroles qu’elle prononça en cette aventure, qui remua toutes les douleurs endormies au fond de son être. Elle s’était fait une religion du silence.

"Un soir, elle apporta un costume de bain qu’elle s’était taillé dans une vieille robe. Il fallut que Silvère retournât chez tante Dide chercher son caleçon. La partie fut toute naïve. Miette ne s’écarta même pas ; elle se déshabilla, naturellement, dans l’ombre d’un saule, si épaisse que son corps d’enfant n’y mit pendant quelques secondes qu’une blancheur vague. Silvère, de peau brune, apparut dans la nuit comme le tronc assombri d’un jeune chêne, tandis que les jambes et les bras de la jeune fille, nus et arrondis, ressemblaient aux tiges laiteuses des bouleaux de la rive. Puis tous deux, comme vêtus des taches sombres que les hauts feuillages laissaient tomber sur eux, entrèrent dans l’eau gaiement, s’appelant, se récriant, surpris par la fraîcheur. Et les scrupules, les hontes inavouées, les pudeurs secrètes, furent oubliés. Ils restèrent là une grande heure, barbotant, se jetant de l’eau au visage, Miette se fâchant, puis éclatant de rire, et Silvère lui donnant sa première leçon, lui enfonçant de temps à autre la tête, pour l’aguerrir. Tant qu’il la tenait d’une main par la ceinture de son costume, en lui passant l’autre main sous le ventre, elle faisait aller furieusement les jambes et les bras, elle croyait nager ; mais, dès qu’il la lâchait, elle se débattait en criant, et, les mains tendues, frappant l’eau, elle se rattrapait où elle pouvait, à la taille du jeune homme, à l’un de ses poignets. Elle s’abandonnait un instant contre lui, elle se reposait, essoufflée, toute ruisselante, tandis que son costume mouillé dessinait les grâces de son buste de vierge. Puis elle criait :","One evening she brought in a bathing suit she had made from an old dress. Silvere had to go back to Aunt Dide's to get his underpants. The game was quite naive. Miette did not even move away; she undressed, naturally, in the shade of a willow tree, so thick that her childish body only cast a vague whiteness there for a few seconds. Silvere, dark-skinned, appeared in the night like the darkened trunk of a young oak, while the legs and arms of the young girl, bare and rounded, resembled the milky stems of the birches on the bank. Then both of them, as if clad in the dark spots which the high foliage dropped on them, entered the water gaily, calling to each other, crying out to each other, surprised by the coolness. And the scruples, the unacknowledged shames, the secret modesty, were forgotten. They remained there for a full hour, splashing about, throwing water in their faces, Miette growing angry, then bursting out laughing, and Silvere giving him his first lesson, banging his head from time to time, to toughen him up. As long as he held her with one hand by the belt of his suit, passing the other hand under her belly, she made her legs and arms move furiously, she thought she was swimming; but, as soon as he let go of her, she struggled, crying, and, with outstretched hands, striking the water, she caught herself where she could, around the young man's waist, by one of his wrists. She abandoned herself against him for a moment, she rested, out of breath, all dripping with water, while her wet suit outlined the graces of her virgin bust. Then she cried:","One evening she came with a bathing costume which she had made out of an old dress; and Silvère was then obliged to go back to aunt Dide’s for his bathing drawers. Their proceedings were characterised by great simplicity. Miette disrobed herself beneath the shade of a stout willow; and when both were ready, enveloped in the blackness which fell from the foliage around them, they gaily entered the cool water, oblivious of all previous scruples, and knowing in their innocence no sense of shame. They remained in the river quite an hour, splashing and throwing water into each other’s faces; Miette now getting cross, now breaking out into laughter, while Silvère gave her her first lesson, dipping her head under every now and again so as to accustom her to the water. As long as he held her up she threw her arms and legs about violently, thinking she was swimming; but directly he let her go , she cried and struggled, striking the water with her outstretched hands, clutching at anything she could get hold of, the young man’s waist or one of his wrists. She leant against him for an instant, resting, out of breath and dripping with water; and then she cried: “Once more; but you do it on purpose, you don’t hold me.”","One evening she arrived with a bathing costume she had made out of an old dress. Silvère was thus obliged to go back to Aunt Dide’s for his bathing drawers. They proceeded with the greatest simplicity. Miette made no attempt to cover herself; she undressed quite naturally, in the shade of a willow tree that was so big that her childish frame merely showed as a vague white shape for a few seconds. Silvère, with his bronzed skin, appeared in the darkness like the shadowy trunk of a young oak, while the girl’s bare, round legs and arms were like the milky stems of the birch trees on the bank. Then, enveloped in the dark shadows that fell from the foliage around them, they gaily entered the water, calling to each other, crying out, surprised by the water’s coolness. Their scruples, their unavowed shame and secret feelings of modesty, were forgotten. They remained in the river for at least an hour, splashing and throwing water into each other’s faces, Miette now getting cross, now bursting into laughter, while Silvère gave her her first lesson, dipping her head under every now and again to get her used to the water. As long as he held her with one hand round the waist and by her costume with the other she threw her arms and legs about violently, thinking she was swimming; but as soon as he let her go she cried and struggled, striking the water with her outstretched hands, clutching at anything she could get hold of, the young man’s waist or one of his wrists. She leaned against him for a moment, resting, out of breath and dripping with water, while her wet costume showed the outline of her virgin breasts. Then she cried:"
"« Je m’en doutais, c’est moi qui devais être le vieux coquin. Je suis heureux que le malentendu soit expliqué. Je vous en prie, messieurs, évitez l’homme dont il vient d’être question, et que je renie formellement. »","“I suspected it, it was I who must have been the old rascal. I'm glad the misunderstanding is explained. I beg you, gentlemen, avoid the man just mentioned, and whom I formally disown. »","Then Rougon, with superb composure, replied: “I thought as much; the ‘old rogue’ was no doubt intended for me. I’ve very glad that this misunderstanding is now cleared up. Gentlemen, pray avoid the man in question, whom I formally repudiate.”","‘I thought as much; the “old fool” was no doubt meant for me. I’m glad this misunderstanding has been cleared up. Gentlemen, please avoid that man; I formally disown him.’"
"La vérité était que les insurgés traitaient ces messieurs avec la plus grande douceur. Ils leur firent même servir, le soir, un excellent dîner. Mais, pour des trembleurs comme le receveur particulier, de pareilles attentions devenaient effrayantes : les insurgés ne devaient les traiter si bien que dans le but de les trouver plus gras et plus tendres, le jour où ils les mangeraient.","The truth was that the insurgents treated these gentlemen with the greatest kindness. They even served them an excellent dinner in the evening. But, for tremblers like the private receiver, such attentions became frightening: the insurgents were only to treat them so well with the aim of finding them fatter and more tender the day they ate them.","As a matter of fact, the insurgents treated the gentlemen with the greatest kindness. They even provided them with an excellent dinner in the evening. Such attentions, however, were terrifying to such a quaker as the receiver of taxes; the insurgents he thought would not treat them so well unless they wished to make them fat and tender for the day when they might wish to devour them.","In reality the insurgents treated these gentlemen with the greatest kindness.

"Lorsque M. Garçonnet sut que la bande réclamait des vivres, il s’offrit pour lui en procurer. Ce fonctionnaire montra, en cette circonstance difficile, une intelligence très nette de la situation. Ces trois mille affamés devaient être satisfaits ; il ne fallait pas que Plassans, à son réveil, les trouvât encore assis sur les trottoirs de ses rues ; s’ils partaient avant le jour, ils auraient simplement passé au milieu de la ville endormie comme un mauvais rêve, comme un de ces cauchemars que l’aube dissipe. Bien qu’il restât prisonnier, M. Garçonnet, suivi par deux gardiens, alla frapper aux portes des boulangers et fit distribuer aux insurgés toutes les provisions qu’il put découvrir.","When M. Garçonnet learned that the band wanted provisions, he offered to get them some. This functionary showed, in this difficult circumstance, a very clear understanding of the situation. These three thousand starved had to be satisfied; Plassans, on waking, must not find them still seated on the sidewalks of his streets; if they left before daybreak, they would simply have passed through the middle of the sleeping town like a bad dream, like one of those nightmares that dawn dissipates. Although he remained a prisoner, M. Garçonnet, followed by two guards, went and knocked on the doors of the bakers and had all the provisions he could find distributed to the insurgents.","When Monsieur Garconnet learnt that the band was in quest of provisions, he offered his services to procure them. This functionary formed, under very difficult circumstances, a proper estimate of the situation.

"Certes, Miette était une enfant. Elle avait pâli à l’approche de la bande, elle avait pleuré ses tendresses envolées ; mais elle était une enfant de courage, une nature ardente que l’enthousiasme exaltait aisément. Aussi l’émotion qui l’avait peu à peu gagnée, la secouait-elle maintenant tout entière. Elle devenait un garçon. Volontiers elle eût pris une arme et suivi les insurgés. Ses dents blanches, à mesure que défilaient les fusils et les faux, se montraient plus longues et plus aiguës, entre ses lèvres rouges, pareilles aux crocs d’un jeune loup qui aurait des envies de mordre. Et lorsqu’elle entendit Silvère dénombrer d’une voix de plus en plus pressée les contingents des campagnes, il lui sembla que l’élan de la colonne s’accélérait encore, à chaque parole du jeune homme. Bientôt ce fut un emportement, une poussière d’hommes balayée par une tempête. Tout se mit à tourner devant elle. Elle ferma les yeux. De grosses larmes chaudes coulaient sur ses joues.","Admittedly, Miette was a child. She had turned pale at the approach of the band, she had wept for her fledged tenderness; but she was a child of courage, an ardent nature easily exalted by enthusiasm. So the emotion which had gradually won over her now shook her entirely. She was becoming a boy. She would gladly have taken a weapon and followed the insurgents. His white teeth, as the guns and scythes passed by, grew longer and sharper between his red lips, like the fangs of a young wolf longing to bite. And when she heard Silvere enumerating the contingents in the countryside in an ever more hurried voice, it seemed to her that the momentum of the column was still accelerating with each word of the young man. Soon there was an outburst, a dust of men swept away by a storm. Everything began to spin in front of her. She closed her eyes. Big hot tears were streaming down her cheeks.","Truly, Miette was but a child. She had turned pale at the approach of the band, she had wept for the loss of love, but she was a brave child, whose ardent nature was easily fired by enthusiasm.

As the muskets and scythes filed past, her white teeth glistened longer and sharper between her red lips, like the fangs of a young wolf eager to bite and tear. And as she listened to Silvère enumerating the contingents from the country-side with ever-increasing haste, the pace of the column seemed to her to accelerate still more. She soon fancied it all a cloud of human dust swept along by a tempest. Everything began to whirl before her. Then she closed her eyes; big hot tears were rolling down her cheeks.","It is true that Miette was only a child.

"Ils continuèrent à avancer sur la pointe des pieds. Puis, à gauche, dans le poste de police qui se trouvait là, ils aperçurent une quinzaine d’hommes couchés sur un lit de camp, ronflant dans la lueur mourante d’une lanterne accrochée au mur. Rougon, qui décidément devenait un grand général, laissa devant le poste la moitié de ses hommes, avec l’ordre de ne pas réveiller les dormeurs, mais de les tenir en respect et de les faire prisonniers, s’ils bougeaient. Ce qui l’inquiétait, c’était cette fenêtre éclairée qu’ils avaient vue de la place ; il flairait toujours Macquart dans l’affaire, et comme il sentait qu’il fallait d’abord s’emparer de ceux qui veillaient en haut, il n’était pas fâché d’opérer par surprise, avant que le bruit d’une lutte les fît se barricader. Il monta doucement, suivi des vingt héros dont il disposait encore. Roudier commandait le détachement resté dans la cour.","They continued to walk on tiptoe. Then, to the left, in the police station that was there, they saw about fifteen men lying on a cot, snoring in the dying light of a lantern hanging on the wall. Rougon, who was definitely becoming a great general, left half his men in front of the post, with orders not to wake the sleepers, but to hold them in check and make them prisoners if they moved. What worried him was that lighted window they had seen from the square; he always scented Macquart in the affair, and as he felt that it was first necessary to seize those who were watching upstairs, he was not sorry to operate by surprise, before the noise of a struggle made them barricade themselves. He climbed slowly, followed by the twenty heroes he still had. Roudier commanded the detachment which remained in the courtyard.","They continued their advance on tip-toes.

He was personally uneasy about the lighted window which they had seen from the square. He still scented Macquart’s hand in the business, and, as he felt that he would first have to make prisoners of those who were watching upstairs, he was not sorry to be able to adopt surprise tactics before the noise of a conflict should impel them to barricade themselves in the first-floor rooms. So he went up quietly, followed by the twenty heroes whom he still had at his disposal. Roudier commanded the detachment remaining in the courtyard.","They continued their advance on tiptoe.

"« Allons, petite, le fruit est mûr… Mais il faut vous rendre utile. »","“Come on, little one, the fruit is ripe… But you have to make yourself useful. »","Of an evening, in the yellow drawing-room, when Granoux’s growl was rendered indistinct by fright, he would draw near to Félicité and whisper in her ear: “Come, little one, the fruit is ripe—but you must make yourself useful.”","‘Well now, my dear child, the fruit is ripe — but you must make yourself useful.’"
"« Eh ! tais-toi, grondait-il avec une colère contenue. Ces femmes ne savent pas ce qu’elles disent ! On ne voudrait pas de moi. On connaît trop bien mes opinions. »","“Hey! shut up, he growled with suppressed anger. These women don't know what they're saying! They wouldn't want me.

"Rougon, qui se sentait très fort en ce moment, alla lui-même rue Canquoin, pour prier les gendarmes de rester chez eux, de ne se mêler de rien. Il fit, d’ailleurs, ouvrir les portes de la gendarmerie, dont les insurgés avaient emporté les clefs. Mais il voulait triompher seul, il n’entendait pas que les gendarmes pussent lui voler une part de sa gloire. S’il avait absolument besoin d’eux, il les appellerait. Et il leur expliqua que leur présence, en irritant peut-être les ouvriers, ne ferait qu’aggraver la situation. Le brigadier le complimenta beaucoup sur sa prudence. Lorsqu’il apprit qu’il y avait un homme blessé dans la caserne, Rougon voulut se rendre populaire, il demanda à le voir. Il trouva Rengade couché, l’œil couvert d’un bandeau, avec ses grosses moustaches qui passaient sous le linge. Il réconforta, par de belles paroles sur le devoir, le borgne jurant et soufflant, exaspéré de sa blessure, qui allait le forcer à quitter le service. Il promit de lui envoyer un médecin.","Rougon, who felt very strong at the moment, went himself to the rue Canquoin to ask the gendarmes to stay at home, not to interfere in anything. He, moreover, had the doors of the gendarmerie opened, the keys of which the insurgents had taken away. But he wanted to triumph alone, he did not intend that the gendarmes could steal a part of his glory from him. If he absolutely needed them, he would call them. And he explained to them that their presence, by perhaps irritating the workers, would only aggravate the situation. The brigadier complimented him greatly on his prudence. When he learned that there was a wounded man in the barracks, Rougon wanted to make himself popular, he asked to see him. He found Rengade lying down, his eyes covered with a blindfold, his big mustaches sticking out under the linen. He comforted, with fine words about duty, the one-eyed man, swearing and huffing, exasperated by his injury, which was going to force him to leave the service. He promised to send her a doctor.","Rougon, who now felt very conscious of his power, repaired to the Rue Canquoin to beg the gendarmes to remain in their barracks and interfere with nothing. He certainly had the doors of the gendarmerie opened— the keys having been carried off by the insurgents—but he wanted to triumph alone, and had no intention of letting the gendarmes rob him of any part of his glory. If he should really have need of them he could always send for them. So he explained to them that their presence might tend to irritate the working-men and thus aggravate the situation. The sergeant in command thereupon complimented him on his prudence. When Rougon was informed that there was a wounded man in the barracks, he asked to see him, by way of rendering himself popular. He found Rengade in bed, with his eye bandaged, and his big moustaches just peeping out from under the linen. With some high-sounding words about duty, Rougon endeavoured to comfort the unfortunate fellow who, having lost an eye, was swearing with exasperation at the thought that his injury would compel him to quit the service. At last Rougon promised to send the doctor to him.","Rougon, who was now very conscious of his power, made his way to the Rue Canquoin to ask the gendarmes to remain in their barracks and desist from any interference.

"« Nous allons avoir froid, réchauffons-nous comme cela. »","“We're going to be cold, let's warm up like this. »","Forthwith she clasped Silvère to her bosom, and, still with her arms about him, murmured: “We shall grow so cold; come close to me that we may be warm.”",‘We’ll get cold; come close to me so that we can be warm.’
"À part ces scènes de violence, Antoine commençait à trouver supportable son existence nouvelle. Il était bien vêtu, mangeait à sa faim, buvait à sa soif. Il avait complètement mis de côté la vannerie ; parfois, quand il s’ennuyait par trop, il se promettait de tresser, pour le prochain marché, une douzaine de corbeilles ; mais, souvent, il ne terminait seulement pas la première. Il garda, sous un canapé, un paquet d’osier qu’il n’usa pas en vingt ans.","Apart from these scenes of violence, Antoine was beginning to find his new existence bearable. He was well dressed, ate his fill, drank his thirst. He had completely put basketry aside; sometimes, when he was too bored, he would promise himself to weave a dozen baskets for the next market; but often he just didn't finish the first one. He kept, under a sofa, a bundle of wicker which he had not used in twenty years.","Excepting for these turbulent scenes, Antoine began to find his new mode of existence quite endurable.

"Silvère grandit dans un continuel tête-à-tête avec Adélaïde. Par une cajolerie d’enfant, il l’appelait tante Dide, nom qui finit par rester à la vieille femme ; le nom de tante, ainsi employé, est en Provence une simple caresse. L’enfant eut pour sa grand-mère une singulière tendresse mêlée d’une terreur respectueuse. Quand il était tout petit et qu’elle avait une crise nerveuse, il se sauvait en pleurant, épouvanté par la décomposition de son visage ; puis il revenait timidement après l’attaque, prêt à se sauver encore, comme si la pauvre vieille eût été capable de le battre. Plus tard, à douze ans, il demeura courageusement, veillant à ce qu’elle ne se blessât pas en tombant de son lit. Il resta des heures à la tenir étroitement entre ses bras pour maîtriser les brusques secousses qui tordaient ses membres. Pendant les intervalles de calme, il regardait avec de grandes pitiés sa face convulsionnée, son corps amaigri, sur lequel les jupes plaquaient, pareilles à un linceul. Ces drames secrets, qui revenaient chaque mois, cette vieille femme rigide comme un cadavre, et cet enfant penché sur elle, épiant en silence le retour de la vie, prenaient, dans l’ombre de la masure, un étrange caractère de morne épouvante et de bonté navrée. Lorsque tante Dide revenait à elle, elle se levait péniblement, rattachait ses jupes, se remettait à vaquer dans le logis, sans même questionner Silvère ; elle ne se souvenait de rien, et l’enfant, par un instinct de prudence, évitait de faire la moindre allusion à la scène qui venait de se passer. Ce furent surtout ces crises renaissantes qui attachèrent profondément le petit-fils à sa grand-mère. Mais, de même qu’elle l’adorait sans effusions bavardes, il eut pour elle une affection cachée et comme honteuse. Au fond, s’il lui était reconnaissant de l’avoir recueilli et élevé, il continuait à voir en elle une créature extraordinaire, en proie à des maux inconnus, qu’il fallait plaindre et respecter. Il n’y avait sans doute plus assez d’humanité dans Adélaïde, elle était trop blanche et trop roide pour que Silvère osât se pendre à son cou. Ils vécurent ainsi dans un silence triste, au fond duquel ils entendaient le frissonnement d’une tendresse infinie.","Silvere grew up in a continual tete-a-tete with Adelaide. With childlike cajoling, he called her Aunt Dide, a name which ended by sticking to the old woman; the name of aunt, thus employed, is in Provence a simple caress. The child had for his grandmother a singular tenderness mingled with a respectful terror. When he was very small and she had a nervous attack, he would run away crying, terrified by the decomposition of her face; then he returned timidly after the attack, ready to run away again, as if the poor old woman had been able to beat him. Later, at age twelve, he remained courageously, ensuring that she did not hurt herself by falling from her bed. He remained for hours holding her tightly in his arms to control the sudden jerks that twisted her limbs. During the intervals of calm, he gazed with great pity on her convulsed face, her emaciated body, on which the skirts stuck like a shroud. These secret dramas, which recurred each month, this old woman rigid as a corpse, and this child leaning over her, silently watching for the return of life, took on, in the shadow of the hovel, a strange character of gloomy terror and with heartbroken goodness. When Aunt Dide came to, she got up painfully, fastened her skirts, went back to wandering around the house, without even questioning Silvere; she remembered nothing, and the child, by an instinct of prudence, avoided making the slightest allusion to the scene which had just taken place. It was especially these recurring crises that deeply attached the grandson to his grandmother. But, just as she adored him without talkative effusions, he had for her a concealed and as it were shameful affection. Basically, if he was grateful to her for having taken him in and brought him up, he continued to see in her an extraordinary creature, prey to unknown evils, whom he had to pity and respect. There was probably no longer enough humanity in Adelaide, she was too white and too stiff for Silvere to dare to hang around her neck. They thus lived in a sad silence, in the depths of which they heard the quivering of an infinite tenderness.","Silvère grew up, ever tête-à-tête with Adélaïde. With childish cajolery he used to call her aunt Dide, a name which ultimately clung to the old woman; the word “aunt” employed in this way is simply a term of endearment in Provence. The child entertained singular affection, not unmixed with respectful terror, for his grandmother. During her nervous fits, when he was quite a little boy, he ran away from her, crying, terrified by her disfigured countenance; and he came back very timidly after the attack, ready to run away again, as though the old woman were disposed to beat him. Later on, however, when he was twelve years old, he would stop there bravely and watch in order that she might not hurt herself by falling off the bed. He stood for hours holding her tightly in his arms to subdue the rude shocks which distorted her. During intervals of calmness he would gaze with pity on her convulsed features and withered frame, over which her skirts lay like a shroud. These hidden dramas, which recurred every month, this old woman as rigid as a corpse, this child bent over her, silently watching for the return of consciousness, made up amidst the darkness of the hovel a strange picture of mournful horror and broken-hearted tenderness. When aunt Dide came round, she would get up with difficulty, and set about her work in the hovel without even questioning Silvère. She remembered nothing, and the child, from a sort of instinctive prudence, avoided the least allusion to what had taken place. These recurring fits, more than anything else, strengthened Silvère’s deep attachment for his grandmother. In the same manner as she adored him without any garrulous effusiveness, he felt a secret, almost bashful, affection for her. While he was really very grateful to her for having taken him in and brought him up, he could not help regarding her as an extraordinary creature, a prey to some strange malady, whom he ought to pity and respect. No doubt there was not sufficient life left in Adélaïde; she was too white and too stiff for Silvère to throw himself on her neck. Thus they lived together amidst melancholy silence, in the depths of which they felt the tremor of boundless love.","Silvère grew up in a continual tête-à-tête with Adélaïde. In his affectionate way he would call her Aunt Dide, a name that ended up sticking to the old woman; the word ‘aunt’, used like this, is a term of endearment in Provence. The child was extremely fond of his grandmother while also being afraid of her. During her nervous attacks, when he was still very young, he would run away crying, terrified by her stricken look; and he would come back very timidly afterwards, ready to run away again, as if half-expecting the old woman to beat him. Later on, however, when he was twelve, he would stay there bravely and watch over her in case she fell off the bed and hurt herself. He stood for hours holding her tightly in his arms in order to control the shaking of her body. During the intervals of calm he would gaze in pity at her contorted features and withered frame, over which her skirt lay like a shroud. These secret dramas in the darkness of the shack, which recurred every month — the old woman as rigid as a corpse, the child bent over her, silently waiting for her to regain consciousness — made a strange picture of horror and tenderness. When Aunt Dide came round, she would stand up with difficulty and set about her work in the shack without a word to Silvère; she remembered nothing, and the child, out of a kind of instinctive discretion, avoided the least allusion to what had taken place. These regular attacks, more than anything else, strengthened Silvère’s attachment to his grandmother. Just as she adored him silently and undemonstratively, he felt a secret, almost bashful, affection for her. While he was really very grateful to her for having taken him in and brought him up, he still saw her as an extraordinary creature, prey to some strange malady, whom he ought to pity and respect.

And so they lived together in melancholy silence, feeling boundless affection for each other."
"Bientôt le moment qu’il guettait arriva. La maison Puech et Lacamp râlait. Le jeune homme négocia alors son mariage avec une adresse prudente. Il fut accueilli, sinon comme un sauveur, du moins comme un expédient nécessaire et acceptable. Le mariage arrêté, il s’occupa activement de la vente de l’enclos. Le propriétaire du Jas-Meiffren, désirant arrondir ses terres, lui avait déjà fait des offres à plusieurs reprises ; un mur mitoyen, bas et mince, séparait seul les deux propriétés. Pierre spécula sur les désirs de son voisin, homme fort riche, qui, pour contenter un caprice, alla jusqu’à donner cinquante mille francs de l’enclos. C’était le payer deux fois sa valeur. D’ailleurs, Pierre se faisait tirer l’oreille avec une sournoiserie de paysan, disant qu’il ne voulait pas vendre, que sa mère ne consentirait jamais à se défaire d’un bien où les Fouque, depuis près de deux siècles, avaient vécu de père en fils. Tout en paraissant hésiter, il préparait la vente. Des inquiétudes lui étaient venues. Selon sa logique brutale, l’enclos lui appartenait, il avait le droit d’en disposer à son gré. Cependant, au fond de cette assurance, s’agitait le vague pressentiment des complications du Code. Il se décida à consulter indirectement un huissier du faubourg.","Soon the moment he had been waiting for arrived. The Puech and Lacamp house grumbled. The young man then negotiated his marriage with careful skill. It was welcomed, if not as a saviour, at least as a necessary and acceptable expedient. The marriage stopped, he actively took care of the sale of the enclosure. The owner of Jas-Meiffren, wishing to round off his land, had already made him offers on several occasions; a party wall, low and thin, only separated the two properties. Pierre speculated on the desires of his neighbour, a very wealthy man, who, to satisfy a whim, went so far as to give fifty thousand francs for the enclosure. It was paying twice its value. Besides, Pierre had his ears pulled with the slyness of a peasant, saying that he did not want to sell, that his mother would never agree to part with a property where the Fouques, for nearly two centuries, had lived from father to son. While appearing to hesitate, he prepared the sale. Concerns had come to him. According to his brutal logic, the enclosure belonged to him, he had the right to dispose of it as he pleased. However, at the bottom of this assurance, there was a vague presentiment of the complications of the Code. He decided to indirectly consult a bailiff of the faubourg.","The moment which he had been awaiting soon arrived. The firm of Puech and Lacamp seemed to be at the last gasp. The young man then negotiated the match with prudent skill. He was received, if not as a deliverer, at least as a necessary and acceptable expedient. The marriage agreed upon, he turned his attention to the sale of the ground. The owner of the Jas-Meiffren, desiring to enlarge his estate, had made him repeated offers. A low, thin, party-wall alone separated the two estates. Pierre speculated on the eagerness of his wealthy neighbour, who, to gratify his caprice, offered as much as fifty thousand francs for the land. It was double its value. Pierre, whoever, with the craftiness of a peasant, pulled a long face, and said that he did not care to sell; that his mother would never consent to get rid of the property where the Fouques had lived from father to son for nearly two centuries. But all the time that he was seemingly holding back he was really making preparations for the sale. Certain doubts had arisen in his mind. According to his own brutal logic, the property belonged to him; he had the right to dispose of it as he chose. Beneath this assurance, however, he had vague presentiments of legal complications.

"Silvère fit encore quelques pas. Il approchait du fond de l’allée, il n’apercevait plus qu’une bande de ciel où se mourait le jour couleur de rouille. Là, pendant deux ans, avait tenu sa vie. La lente approche de la mort, dans ce sentier où depuis si longtemps il promenait son cœur, était d’une douceur ineffable. Il s’attardait, il jouissait longuement de ses adieux à tout ce qu’il aimait, les herbes, les pièces de bois, les pierres du vieux mur, ces choses que Miette avait faites vivantes. Et sa pensée s’égarait de nouveau. Ils attendaient d’avoir l’âge pour se marier. Tante Dide serait restée avec eux. Ah ! s’ils avaient fui loin, bien loin, au fond de quelque village inconnu, où les vauriens du faubourg ne seraient plus venus jeter au visage de la Chantegreil le crime de son père ! Quelle paix heureuse ! Il aurait ouvert un atelier de charron, sur le bord d’une grande route. Certes, il faisait bon marché de ses ambitions d’ouvrier ; il n’enviait plus la carrosserie, les calèches aux larges panneaux vernis, luisants comme des miroirs. Dans la stupeur de son désespoir, il ne put se rappeler pourquoi son rêve de félicité ne se réaliserait jamais. Que ne s’en allait-il, avec Miette et tante Dide ? La mémoire tendue, il écoutait un bruit aigre de fusillade, il voyait un drapeau tomber devant lui, la hampe cassée, l’étoffe pendante, comme l’aile d’un oiseau abattu d’un coup de feu. C’était la République qui dormait avec Miette, dans un pan du drapeau rouge. Ah ! misère, elles étaient mortes toutes les deux ! elles avaient un trou saignant à la poitrine, et voilà ce qui lui barrait la vie maintenant, les cadavres de ses deux tendresses. Il n’avait plus rien, il pouvait mourir. Depuis Sainte-Roure, c’était là ce qui lui avait donné cette douceur d’enfant, vague et stupide. On l’aurait battu sans qu’il le sentît. Il n’était plus dans sa chair, il était resté agenouillé auprès de ses mortes bien-aimées, sous les arbres, dans la fumée âcre de la poudre.","Silvere took a few more steps. He was approaching the end of the alley, he could only see a strip of sky where the rust-colored day was dying. There, for two years, had held his life. The slow approach of death, in this path where for so long he had walked his heart, was of an ineffable sweetness. He lingered, he enjoyed a long farewell to everything he loved, the grass, the pieces of wood, the stones of the old wall, those things that Miette had made alive. And his thoughts wandered again. They waited until they were old enough to get married. Aunt Dide would have stayed with them. Ah! if they had fled far, far away, to the depths of some unknown village, where the rascals of the faubourg would no longer have come to throw her father's crime in the face of Chantegreil! What happy peace! He would have opened a wheelwright's workshop, on the side of a main road. Certainly, he made light of his working-class ambitions; he no longer envied the coachwork, the carriages with their large varnished panels, gleaming like mirrors. In the stupor of his despair, he couldn't remember why his dream of bliss would never come true. Why didn't he go away with Miette and Aunt Dide? Memory tense, he listened to a sharp sound of firing, he saw a flag fall in front of him, the pole broken, the fabric hanging down, like the wing of a bird shot down. It was the Republic that slept with Miette, in a section of the red flag. Ah! misery, they were both dead! they had a bleeding hole in their breasts, and that is what barred her life now, the corpses of her two tendernesses. He had nothing left, he could die. Since Sainte-Roure, that was what had given him that childish sweetness, vague and stupid. We would have beaten him without his feeling it. He was no longer in his flesh, he had remained kneeling beside his beloved dead, under the trees, in the acrid smoke of the gunpowder.","Silvère took a few more steps. He was approaching the end of the path, and could see nothing but a strip of sky in which the rust-coloured light was fading away. Here had he spent his life for two years past.

He loitered, bidding a long and lingering farewell to all he loved; the grass, the timber, the stone of the old wall, all those things into which Miette had breathed life. And again his thoughts wandered. They were waiting till they should be old enough to marry: Aunt Dide would remain with them. Ah! if they had fled far away, very far away, to some unknown village, where the scamps of the Faubourg would no longer have been able to come and cast Chantegreil’s crime in his daughter’s face. What peaceful bliss! They would have opened a wheelwright’s workshop beside some high road. No doubt, he cared little for his ambitions now; he no longer thought of coachmaking, of carriages with broad varnished panels as shiny as mirrors. In the stupor of his despair he could not remember why his dream of bliss would never come to pass. Why did he not go away with Miette and aunt Dide? Then as he racked his memory, he heard the sharp crackling of a fusillade; he saw a standard fall before him, its staff broken and its folds drooping like the wings of a bird brought down by a shot. It was the Republic falling asleep with Miette under the red flag. Ah, what wretchedness! They were both dead, both had bleeding wounds in their breasts. And it was they— the corpses of his two loves—that now barred his path of life. He had nothing left him and might well die himself. These were the thoughts that had made him so gentle, so listless, so childlike all the way from Sainte-Roure. The soldiers might have struck him, he would not have felt it. His spirit no longer inhabited his body. It was far away, prostrate beside the loved ones who were dead under the trees amidst the pungent smoke of the gunpowder.","Silvère took a few more steps.

"– Moi je dis la vérité, voilà tout… Je voudrais t’ouvrir les yeux. Notre famille est une sale famille ; c’est triste, mais c’est comme ça.

"Silvère, blanc d’émotion, écoutait et regardait toujours.

"Cependant, au bout de dix ans de fainéantise, Macquart trouva qu’il travaillait trop. Son continuel rêve était d’inventer une façon de bien vivre sans rien faire. Sa paresse ne se serait pas contentée de pain et d’eau, comme celle de certains fainéants qui consentent à rester sur leur faim, pourvu qu’ils puissent se croiser les bras. Lui, il voulait de bons repas et de belles journées d’oisiveté. Il parla un instant d’entrer comme domestique chez quelque noble du quartier Saint-Marc. Mais un palefrenier de ses amis lui fit peur en lui racontant les exigences de ses maîtres. Macquart, dégoûté de ses corbeilles, voyant venir le jour où il lui faudrait acheter l’osier nécessaire, allait se vendre comme remplaçant et reprendre la vie de soldat, qu’il préférait mille fois à celle d’ouvrier, lorsqu’il fit la connaissance d’une femme dont la rencontre modifia ses plans.","However, after ten years of laziness, Macquart found that he was working too much. His lifelong dream was to invent a way to live well without doing anything. His laziness would not have been content with bread and water, like that of certain lazy people who consent to remain hungry, provided they can sit back. He wanted good meals and nice days of idleness. He spoke for a moment of becoming a servant to some nobleman in the Saint-Marc quarter. But a groom of his friends frightened him by telling him about the demands of his masters. Macquart, disgusted with his baskets, seeing the day coming when he would have to buy the necessary wicker, was about to sell himself as a substitute and resume the life of a soldier, which he preferred a thousand times to that of a worker, when he made the acquaintance with a woman whose meeting changed his plans.","At last, at the end of ten years of idleness, Antoine considered that he had been working too hard. His constant dream was to devise some expedient by which he might live at his ease without having to do anything. His idleness would never have rested content with bread and water; he was not like certain lazy persons who are willing to put up with hunger provided they can keep their hands in their pockets. He liked good feeding and nothing to do. He talked at one time of taking a situation as servant in some nobleman’s house in the Saint-Marc quarter. But one of his friends, a groom, frightened him by describing the exacting ways of his masters. Finally Macquart, sick of his baskets, and seeing the time approach when he would be compelled to purchase the requisite osier, was on the point of selling himself as an army substitute and resuming his military life, which he preferred a thousand times to that of an artisan, when he made the acquaintance of a woman, an acquaintance which modified his plans.","After ten years of idleness, it was not long before Macquart began to think that he was working too hard.

"Elle recula, elle cessa de sourire, et ses yeux devinrent d’un noir dur, luisant de défiance. Ce garçon allait donc l’insulter comme les autres !

"Les gens qu’il alla consulter le reçurent avec un mépris qui lui fit verser des larmes de rage. En province, on est implacable pour les familles déchues.

Pierre, d’ailleurs, commençait à se laver de sa tache originelle.

Provincial folks are inexorable towards fallen families.

Pierre, however, was at that time already beginning to purify himself of his early stains. People laughed at his roguery; some even went so far as to say that he had done quite right, if he really had taken possession of the money, and that it would be a good lesson to the dissolute folks of the town.","Those he consulted received him with a contempt that brought tears of rage to his eyes.

"Depuis son départ, il n’était pas venu passer un seul jour de congé à Plassans, son frère inventant mille prétextes pour l’en tenir éloigné. Aussi ignorait-il complètement la façon adroite dont Pierre s’était emparé de la fortune de leur mère. Adélaïde, dans l’indifférence profonde où elle vivait, ne lui écrivit pas trois fois, pour lui dire simplement qu’elle se portait bien. Le silence qui accueillait le plus souvent ses nombreuses demandes d’argent ne lui donna aucun soupçon ; la ladrerie de Pierre suffit pour lui expliquer la difficulté qu’il éprouvait à arracher, de loin en loin, une misérable pièce de vingt francs. Cela ne fit, d’ailleurs, qu’augmenter sa rancune contre son frère, qui le laissait se morfondre au service, malgré sa promesse formelle de le racheter. Il se jurait, en rentrant au logis, de ne plus obéir en petit garçon et de réclamer carrément sa part de fortune, pour vivre à sa guise. Il rêva, dans la diligence qui le ramenait, une délicieuse existence de paresse. L’écroulement de ses châteaux en Espagne fut terrible. Quand il arriva dans le faubourg et qu’il ne reconnut plus l’enclos des Fouque, il resta stupide. Il lui fallut demander la nouvelle adresse de sa mère. Là, il y eut une scène épouvantable.

Adelaide, in the profound indifference in which she lived, did not write to him three times, simply to tell him that she was well. The silence which most often greeted his numerous requests for money gave him no suspicion; Pierre's sleazyness sufficed to explain to him the difficulty he experienced in tearing off, from time to time, a wretched twenty-franc piece. This only increased his resentment against his brother, who let him languish in the service, despite his formal promise to ransom him. He swore to himself, on returning home, that he would no longer obey like a little boy and that he would simply claim his share of the fortune, in order to live as he pleased. He dreamed, in the diligence which brought him back, of a delicious existence of laziness. The collapse of its castles in Spain was terrible. When he arrived in the faubourg and no longer recognized the Fouques' enclosure, he remained stupid. He had to ask for his mother's new address. There was a terrible scene. Adelaide quietly informed him of the sale of the property.

In the diligence which conveyed him home he dreamed of a delightful life of idleness. The shattering of his castles in the air was terrible.

"– Ça, je ne sais pas, dit-elle avec un sourire. Il y aura peut-être des coups de fusil. »","""That, I don't know,"" she said with a smile. There may be gunshots. »","“Ah! I don’t know,” she said, with a smile. “There will perhaps be a shot or two fired.”","‘I don’t know,’ she said with a smile. ‘A few shots might be fired.’"
« Est-ce que c’est avec le fusil que tu as tué le gendarme ? » demanda-t-elle.,“Was it with the gun that you killed the gendarme? she asked.,"All her nature was concentrated in one unique thought, to which she at last gave expression with ardent curiosity: “Did you kill the gendarme with the gun?” Either Silvère did not quite catch what she said, or else he misunderstood her.","‘Did you kill the gendarme with the gun?’ Either Silvère did not catch what she said, or he misunderstood."
"« Et d’abord, il faut m’ôter ce chiffon-là. Ça devient ridicule, tu sais ! »","“And first, you have to take that rag off me.

"Ils reprirent leurs longues causeries. Il ne resta dans l’esprit de Silvère, du danger que venaient de courir leurs amours ignorantes, qu’une grande admiration pour la vigueur physique de Miette. En quinze jours, elle avait appris à nager, et souvent, quand ils luttaient de vitesse, il l’avait vue couper le courant d’un bras aussi rapide que le sien. Lui, qui adorait la force, les exercices corporels, se sentait le cœur attendri en la voyant si forte, si puissante et si adroite de corps. Il entrait, dans son cœur, une estime singulière pour ses gros bras. Un soir, après un de ces premiers bains qui les laissaient si rieurs, ils s’étaient empoignés par la taille, sur une bande de sable, et pendant de longues minutes, ils avaient lutté, sans que Silvère parvînt à renverser Miette ; puis le jeune homme, ayant perdu l’équilibre, c’était l’enfant qui était restée debout. Son amoureux la traitait en garçon, et ce furent ces marches forcées, ces courses folles à travers les prés, ces nids dénichés à la cime des arbres, ces luttes, tous ces jeux violents, qui les protégèrent si longtemps et les empêchèrent de salir leurs tendresses. Il y avait encore dans l’amour de Silvère, outre son admiration pour la crânerie de son amoureuse, les douceurs de son cœur tendre aux malheureux. Lui qui ne pouvait voir un être abandonné, un pauvre homme, un enfant marchant nu-pieds dans la poussière des routes, sans éprouver à la gorge un serrement de pitié, il aimait Miette, parce que personne ne l’aimait, parce qu’elle menait une existence rude de paria. Quand il la voyait rire, il était profondément ému de cette joie qu’il lui donnait. Puis, l’enfant était une sauvage comme lui, ils s’entendaient dans la haine des commères du faubourg. Le rêve qu’il faisait, lorsque, dans la journée, il cerclait chez son patron les roues des carrioles, à grands coups de marteau, était plein de folie généreuse. Il pensait à Miette en rédempteur. Toutes ses lectures lui remontaient au cerveau ; il voulait épouser un jour son amie pour la relever aux yeux du monde ; il se donnait une mission sainte, le rachat, le salut de la fille du forçat. Et il avait la tête tellement bourrée de certains plaidoyers, qu’il ne se disait pas ces choses simplement ; il s’égarait en plein mysticisme social, il imaginait des réhabilitations d’apothéose, il voyait Miette assise sur un trône, au bout du cours Sauvaire, et toute la ville s’inclinant, demandant pardon, chantant des louanges. Heureusement qu’il oubliait ces belles choses, dès que Miette sautait son mur et qu’elle lui disait sur la grande route :","They resumed their long talks. Nothing remained in Silvere's mind, of the danger which their ignorant love had just run, but a great admiration for the physical vigor of Miette. In a fortnight she had learned to swim, and often when they were struggling he had seen her cut the current with an arm as fast as his. He, who adored strength, bodily exercises, felt his heart tender on seeing her so strong, so powerful and so skilful in body. There entered into his heart a singular esteem for his big arms. One evening, after one of those first baths which left them so laughing, they had grabbed each other by the waist, on a strip of sand, and for long minutes they had struggled, without Silvere succeeding in overthrowing Miette; then the young man, having lost his balance, it was the child who had remained standing. Her lover treated her as a boy, and it was these forced marches, these mad races across the meadows, these nests unearthed in the tops of the trees, these struggles, all these violent games, which protected them for so long and prevented them from soiling their tenderness. There was still in Silvere's love, besides his admiration for the swagger of his lover, the sweetness of his tender heart for the unfortunate. He who could not see an abandoned being, a poor man, a child walking barefoot in the dust of the roads, without feeling a pang of pity in his throat, he loved Miette, because no one loved him, because she led a rough pariah existence. When he saw her laugh, he was deeply moved by the joy he gave her. Besides, the child was a savage like himself, they got along in their hatred of the gossips of the faubourg. The dream he had when, during the day, he circled the wheels of the carts at his employer's house, with great blows of a hammer, was full of generous madness. He thought of Miette as a redeemer. All his reading went back to his brain; he wanted to marry his friend one day to raise her up in the eyes of the world; he gave himself a holy mission, the redemption, the salvation of the convict's daughter. And he had his head so full of certain pleadings, till he just didn't think these things to himself; he lost his way in the midst of social mysticism, he imagined rehabilitations of apotheosis, he saw Miette seated on a throne at the end of the Cours Sauvaire, and the whole town bowing, asking forgiveness, singing praises. Luckily he forgot these beautiful things as soon as Miette jumped over her wall and said to him on the high road:","Then their long conversations began anew. The dangers to which the innocence of their love had lately been exposed had left no other trace in Silvère’s mind than great admiration for Miette’s physical strength. She had learned to swim in a fortnight, and often, when they raced together, he had seen her stem the current with a stroke as rapid as his own. He, who delighted in strength and bodily exercises, felt a thrill of pleasure at seeing her so strong, so active and adroit. He entertained at heart a singular admiration for her stout arms. One evening, after one of the first baths that had left them so playful, they caught each other round the waist on a strip of sand, and wrestled for several minutes without Silvère being able to throw Miette. At last, indeed, it was the young man who lost his balance, while the girl remained standing. Her sweetheart treated her like a boy, and it was those long rambles of theirs, those wild races across the meadows, those birds’ nests filched from the tree crests, those struggles and violent games of one and another kind that so long shielded them and their love from all impurity. Then, too, apart from his youthful admiration for his sweetheart’s dashing pluck, Silvère felt for her all the compassionate tenderness of a heart that ever softened towards the unfortunate. He, who could never see any forsaken creature, a poor man, or a child, walking barefooted along the dusty roads, without a throb of pity, loved Miette because nobody else loved her, because she virtually led an outcast’s hard life. When he saw her smile he was deeply moved by the joy he brought her. Moreover, the child was a wildling, like himself, and they were of the same mind in hating all the gossips of the Faubourg. The dreams in which Silvère indulged in the daytime, while he plied his heavy hammer round the cartwheels in his master’s shop, were full of generous enthusiasm. He fancied himself Miette’s redeemer. All his reading rushed to his head; he meant to marry his sweetheart some day, in order to raise her in the eyes of the world. It was like a holy mission that he imposed upon himself, that of redeeming and saving the convict’s daughter. And his head was so full of certain theories and arguments, that he did not tell himself these things in simple fashion, but became lost in perfect social mysticism; imagining rehabilitation in the form of an apotheosis in which he pictured Miette seated on a throne, at the end of the Cours Sauvaire, while the whole town prostrated itself before her, entreating her pardon and singing her praises. Happily he forgot all these fine things as soon as Miette jumped over the wall, and said to him on the high road: “Let us have a race!","Then their long conversations began anew.

"« Le contingent de la Palud. C’est le premier bourg qui s’est mis en insurrection. Les hommes en blouse sont des ouvriers qui travaillent les chênes-lièges ; les autres, les hommes aux vestes de velours, doivent être des chasseurs et des charbonniers vivant dans les gorges de la Seille… Les chasseurs ont connu ton père, Miette. Ils ont de bonnes armes qu’ils manient avec adresse. Ah ! si tous étaient armés de la sorte ! Les fusils manquent. Vois, les ouvriers n’ont que des bâtons. »","“The contingent of La Palud.

"Et, sans que Silvère eût besoin de les interroger, ses camarades lui racontèrent l’histoire du braconnier Chantegreil et de sa fille Miette, avec cette haine aveugle des foules contre les parias. Ils traitèrent surtout cette dernière d’une sale façon ; et toujours l’insulte de fille de galérien leur venait aux lèvres, comme une raison sans réplique qui condamnait la chère innocente à une éternelle honte.","And, without Silvere needing to question them, his comrades told him the story of the poacher Chantegreil and his daughter Miette, with that blind hatred of the crowds against the pariahs.

"Miette se penchait maintenant pour suivre plus longtemps du regard les petites troupes que lui désignait le jeune homme. Le frisson qui s’emparait d’elle lui montait dans la poitrine et la prenait à la gorge. À ce moment parut un bataillon plus nombreux et plus discipliné que les autres. Les insurgés qui en faisaient partie, presque tous vêtus de blouses bleues, avaient la taille serrée d’une ceinture rouge ; on les eût dit pourvus d’un uniforme. Au milieu d’eux marchait un homme à cheval, ayant un sabre au côté. Le plus grand nombre de ces soldats improvisés avaient des fusils, des carabines ou d’anciens mousquets de la garde nationale.","Miette was leaning forward now to follow longer with her gaze the small troops pointed out to her by the young man.

In the midst of them walked a man on horseback, with a saber at his side.

"Elle chantait, elle riait, elle criait et répétait : Maudits ! sur une étrange phrase musicale, pareille au bruit déchirant d’une fusillade.

"Ce soir-là, Antoine fut encore plus dur pour sa mère ; ne sachant sur qui se venger, il reprit ses accusations de la veille ; il tint la malheureuse jusqu’à minuit, toute frissonnante de honte et d’épouvante.

"Pierre rayonnait, sa grosse face pâle suait le triomphe. Félicité, aguerrie, disait qu’ils loueraient sans doute le logement de ce pauvre M.

"Pendant ce temps, Rougon prenait officiellement possession de la mairie. Il n’était resté que huit conseillers municipaux ; les autres se trouvaient entre les mains des insurgés, ainsi que le maire et les deux adjoints. Ces huit messieurs, de la force de Granoux, eurent des sueurs d’angoisse, lorsque ce dernier leur expliqua la situation critique de la ville. Pour comprendre avec quel effarement ils vinrent se jeter dans les bras de Rougon, il faudrait connaître les bonshommes dont sont composés les conseils municipaux de certaines petites villes. À Plassans, le maire avait sous la main d’incroyables buses, de purs instruments d’une complaisance passive. Aussi, M. Garçonnet n’étant plus là, la machine municipale devait se détraquer et appartenir à quiconque saurait en ressaisir les ressorts. À cette heure, le sous-préfet ayant quitté le pays, Rougon se trouvait naturellement, par la force des circonstances, le maître unique et absolu de la ville ; crise étonnante, qui mettait le pouvoir entre les mains d’un homme taré, auquel, la veille, pas un de ses concitoyens n’aurait prêté cent francs.","During this time, Rougon officially took possession of the town hall. Only eight municipal councilors remained; the others were in the hands of the insurgents, as well as the mayor and the two deputies. These eight gentlemen, of the strength of Granoux, had sweats of anguish, when the latter explained to them the critical situation of the city. To understand with what bewilderment they came and threw themselves into Rougon's arms, one would have to know the good men of whom the municipal councils of certain small towns are composed. In Plassans, the mayor had incredible nozzles at his fingertips, pure instruments of passive complacency. Also, M. Garçonnet being no longer there, the municipal machine must have broken down and belong to whoever knew how to get hold of its springs. At this hour, the sub-prefect having left the country, Rougon naturally found himself, by the force of circumstances, the sole and absolute master of the town; astonishing crisis, which placed power in the hands of a crazy man, to whom, the day before, not one of his fellow citizens would have lent a hundred francs.","In the meanwhile, Rougon was taking official possession of the mayor’s offices. There were only eight municipal councillors left; the others were in the hands of the insurgents, as well as the mayor and his two assessors. The eight remaining gentlemen, who were all on a par with Granoux, perspired with fright when the latter explained to them the critical situation of the town. It requires an intimate knowledge of the kind of men who compose the municipal councils of some of the smaller towns, in order to form an idea of the terror with which these timid folk threw themselves into Rougon’s arms. At Plassans, the mayor had the most incredible blockheads under him, men without any ideas of their own, and accustomed to passive obedience. Consequently, as Monsieur Garconnet was no longer there, the municipal machine was bound to get out of order, and fall completely under the control of the man who might know how to set it working. Moreover, as the sub-prefect had left the district, Rougon naturally became sole and absolute master of the town; and thus, strange to relate, the chief administrative authority fell into the hands of a man of indifferent repute, to whom, on the previous evening, not one of his fellow-citizens would have lent a hundred francs.","In the meantime Rougon was taking official possession of the mayor’s office. There were only eight councillors left; the others were in the hands of the insurgents, along with the mayor and his two deputies. These eight gentlemen, who were all as strong as Granoux, were thrown into a state of great agitation when the latter explained how critical the situation was. To understand the degree of terror that propelled these men into Rougon’s arms you need to know the kind of people who compose the councils of some of the smaller towns in France. In Plassans the mayor had under him the most appalling dimwits, men with no ideas of their own and used to passive obedience. Consequently, as Monsieur Garçonnet was no longer there, the administrative machine was bound to break down and fall under the control of anyone who could get it working again. So, as the sub-prefect had left the district, Rougon naturally found himself, by force of circumstance, the absolute master of the town: an extraordinary situation, whereby all administrative power had fallen into the hands of a dull-witted individual to whom, the day before, not one of his fellow citizens would have lent a hundred francs."
"Pierre était gêné, il accepta, un peu inquiet du désintéressement d’Aristide. Celui-ci se disait que de longtemps peut-être son père n’aurait pas dix mille francs liquides à lui rendre, et que lui et sa femme vivraient largement à ses dépens, tant que l’association ne pourrait être rompue. C’était là quelques billets de banque admirablement placés. Quand le marchand d’huile comprit quel marché de dupe il avait fait, il ne lui était plus permis de se débarrasser d’Aristide ; la dot d’Angèle se trouvait engagée dans des spéculations qui tournaient mal. Il dut garder le ménage chez lui, exaspéré, frappé au cœur par le gros appétit de sa belle-fille et par les fainéantises de son fils. Vingt fois, s’il avait pu les désintéresser, il aurait mis à la porte cette vermine qui lui suçait le sang, selon son énergique expression. Félicité les soutenait sourdement ; le jeune homme, qui avait pénétré ses rêves d’ambition, lui exposait chaque soir d’admirables plans de fortune qu’il devait prochainement réaliser. Par un hasard assez rare, elle était au mieux avec sa bru ; il faut dire qu’Angèle n’avait pas une volonté et qu’on pouvait disposer d’elle comme d’un meuble. Pierre s’emportait, quand sa femme lui parlait des succès futurs de leur fils cadet ; il l’accusait plutôt de devoir être un jour la ruine de leur maison. Pendant les quatre années que le ménage resta chez lui, il tempêta ainsi, usant en querelles sa rage impuissante, sans qu’Aristide ni Angèle sortissent le moins du monde de leur calme souriant. Ils s’étaient posés là, ils y restaient, comme des masses. Enfin, Pierre eut une heureuse chance ; il put rendre à son fils ses dix mille francs. Quand il voulut compter avec lui, Aristide chercha tant de chicanes, qu’il dut le laisser partir sans lui retenir un sou pour ses frais de nourriture et de logement. Le ménage alla s’établir à quelques pas, sur une petite place du vieux quartier, nommée la place Saint-Louis. Les dix mille francs furent vite mangés. Il fallut s’établir. Aristide, d’ailleurs, ne changea rien à sa vie tant qu’il y eut de l’argent à la maison. Lorsqu’il en fut à son dernier billet de cent francs, il devint nerveux. On le vit rôder dans la ville d’un air louche ; il ne prit plus sa demi-tasse au cercle ; il regarda jouer, fiévreusement, sans toucher une carte. La misère le rendit pire encore qu’il n’était. Longtemps il tint le coup, il s’entêta à ne rien faire. Il eut un enfant, en 1840, le petit Maxime, que sa grand-mère Félicité fit heureusement entrer au collège, et dont elle paya secrètement la pension. C’était une bouche de moins chez Aristide ; mais la pauvre Angèle mourait de faim, le mari dut enfin chercher une place. Il réussit à entrer à la sous-préfecture. Il y resta près de dix années, et n’arriva qu’aux appointements de dix-huit cents francs. Dès lors, haineux, amassant le fiel, il vécut dans l’appétit continuel des jouissances dont il était sevré. Sa position infime l’exaspérait ; les misérables cent cinquante francs qu’on lui mettait dans la main, lui semblaient une ironie de la fortune. Jamais pareille soif d’assouvir sa chair ne brûla un homme. Félicité, à laquelle il contait ses souffrances, ne fut pas fâchée de le voir affamé ; elle pensa que la misère fouetterait ses paresses. L’oreille au guet, en embuscade, il se mit à regarder autour de lui, comme un voleur qui cherche un bon coup à faire. Au commencement de l’année 1848, lorsque son frère partit pour Paris, il eut un instant l’idée de le suivre. Mais Eugène était garçon ; lui ne pouvait traîner sa femme si loin, sans avoir en poche une forte somme. Il attendit, flairant une catastrophe, prêt à étrangler la première proie venue.","Pierre was embarrassed, he accepted, a little worried about Aristide's disinterestedness. The latter said to himself that his father might not have ten thousand francs in cash to give him back for a long time, and that he and his wife would live largely at his expense, so long as the association could not be broken. These were some beautifully placed banknotes. When the oil merchant realized what a fool's bargain he had made, he was no longer allowed to get rid of Aristide; Angèle's dowry was involved in speculations that turned out badly. He had to keep the housework at home, exasperated, stricken to the heart by his daughter-in-law's great appetite and his son's laziness. Twenty times, if he had been able to disinterest them, he would have thrown out this vermin who sucked his blood, according to his energetic expression. Felicite supported them secretly; the young man, who had penetrated his dreams with ambition, explained to him every evening admirable plans for his fortune which he was soon to realize. By a rather rare chance, she was on the best terms with her daughter-in-law; it must be said that Angèle did not have a will and that we could dispose of her like a piece of furniture. Pierre lost his temper when his wife spoke to him of the future successes of their youngest son; he rather accused him of having to be the ruin of their house one day. During the four years that the couple remained at home, he stormed like this, using his impotent rage in quarrels, without Aristide or Angèle emerging in the least from their smiling calm. They had landed there, they remained there, like masses. Finally, Pierre had a happy chance; he was able to give his son back his ten thousand francs. When he wanted to reckon with him, Aristide sought so many quarrels that he had to let him go without withholding a penny from him for his food and lodging expenses. The couple went to settle a few steps away, in a little square in the old quarter, called the Place Saint-Louis. The ten thousand francs were quickly eaten up. We had to settle down. Aristide, moreover, changed nothing in his life as long as there was money in the house. When he got down to his last hundred-franc note, he grew nervous. He was seen prowling the town with a suspicious air; he no longer took his half-cup from the circle; he watched the game feverishly, without touching a card. Misery made him even worse than he was. For a long time he held on, he stubbornly did nothing. He had a child in 1840, little Maxime, whom his grandmother Félicité fortunately got into college, and whose board she secretly paid for. It was one less mouth at Aristide; but poor Angèle was starving, the husband finally had to look for a job. He succeeded in entering the sub-prefecture. He stayed there nearly ten years, and only got a salary of eighteen hundred francs. From then on, hateful, heaping up gall, he lived in the continual appetite for the enjoyments from which he was weaned. His tiny position exasperated him; the miserable one hundred and fifty francs which were placed in his hand seemed to him an irony of fortune. Never had such a thirst to satisfy his flesh burned a man. Felicite, to whom he related his sufferings, was not sorry to see him starving; she thought that misery would whip up her laziness. Listening on the lookout, in ambush, he began to look around him, like a thief looking for a good trick to do. At the beginning of the year 1848, when his brother left for Paris, it occurred to him for a moment to follow him. But Eugene was a boy; he couldn't drag his wife so far without having a large sum in his pocket. He waited, smelling catastrophe, ready to strangle the first prey that came his way.","Pierre was short of money at the time, and accepted, not, however, without some uneasiness at Aristide’s disinterestedness. The latter calculated that it would be years before his father would have ten thousand francs in ready money to repay him, so that he and his wife would live at the paternal expense so long as the partnership could not be dissolved. It was an admirable investment for his few bank-notes. When the oil-dealer understood what a foolish bargain he had made he was not in a position to rid himself of Aristide; Angèle’s dowry was involved in speculations which were turning out unfavourably. He was exasperated, stung to the heart, at having to provide for his daughter-in-law’s voracious appetite and keep his son in idleness. Had he been able to buy them out of the business he would twenty times have shut his doors on those bloodsuckers, as he emphatically expressed it. Félicité secretly defended them; the young man, who had divined her dreams of ambition, would every evening describe to her the elaborate plans by which he would shortly make a fortune. By a rare chance she had remained on excellent terms with her daughter-in-law. It must be confessed that Angèle had no will of her own—she could be moved and disposed of like a piece of furniture. Meantime Pierre became enraged whenever his wife spoke to him of the success their youngest son would ultimately achieve; he declared that he would really bring them to ruin. During the four years that the young couple lived with him he stormed in this manner, wasting his impotent rage in quarrels, without in the least disturbing the equanimity of Aristide and Angèle. They were located there, and there they intended to remain like blocks of wood. At last Pierre met with a stroke of luck which enabled him to return the ten thousand francs to his son. When, however, he wanted to reckon up accounts with him, Aristide interposed so much chicanery that he had to let the couple go without deducting a copper for their board and lodging. They installed themselves but a short distance off, in a part of the old quarter called the Place Saint-Louis. The ten thousand francs were soon consumed. They had everything to get for their new home. Moreover Aristide made no change in his mode of living as long as any money was left in the house. When he had reached the last hundred-franc note he felt rather nervous. He was seen prowling about the town in a suspicious manner. He no longer took his customary cup of coffee at the club; he watched feverishly whilst play was going on, without touching a card. Poverty made him more spiteful than he would otherwise have been. He bore the blow for a long time, obstinately refusing to do anything in the way of work. In 1840 he had a son, little Maxime, whom his grandmother Félicité fortunately sent to college, paying his fees clandestinely. That made one mouth less at home; but poor Angèle was dying of hunger, and her husband was at last compelled to seek a situation. He secured one at the Sub-Prefecture. He remained there nearly ten years, and only attained a salary of eighteen hundred francs per annum. From that time forward it was with ever increasing malevolence and rancour that he hungered for the enjoyments of which he was deprived. His lowly position exasperated him; the paltry hundred and fifty francs which he received every month seemed to him an irony of fate. Never did man burn with such desire for self-gratification. Félicité, to whom he imparted his sufferings, was by no means grieved to see him so eager. She thought his misery would stimulate his energies. At last, crouching in ambush as it were, with his ears wide open, he began to look about him like a thief seeking his opportunity. At the beginning of 1848, when his brother left for Paris, he had a momentary idea of following him. But Eugène was a bachelor; and he, Aristide, could not take his wife so far without money. So he waited, scenting a catastrophe, and ready to fall on the first prey that might come within his reach.","Pierre was short of money at the time, and accepted, though not without feeling somewhat uneasy about Aristide’s disinterestedness.

It was an admirable little investment for him. When the oil-dealer realized what a foolish bargain he had made, he was no longer in a position to rid himself of Aristide; Angèle’s dowry was now locked into speculations that were turning out badly. He was highly annoyed, cut to the quick, at having to satisfy his daughter-in-law’s voracious appetite and keep his son in idleness. If he had been able to buy them out of the business, he would immediately have thrown out those bloodsuckers, as he colourfully put it. Félicité secretly supported them; Aristide, who had divined her ambitious dreams, would describe to her every evening the elaborate plans by which he would soon make a fortune.

His lowly position frustrated him; the paltry hundred and fifty francs he received every month seemed to him an irony of fate. Never did a man burn with such desire for self-gratification. Félicité, with whom he shared his frustration, was by no means displeased to see him so ravenous; she thought his lack of money would stir him to action. At last, crouching in ambush so to speak, with his ears pricked up, he began to look round like a thief waiting for an opportunity. At the beginning of 1848, when his brother left for Paris, he thought for a moment that he would follow him; but Eugène was unmarried, and he, Aristide, could not take his wife so far without a considerable amount of money.

« Je t’aime ! murmurait-il. Je suis ton frère. Pourquoi dis-tu que nous venons de faire le mal ? Nous nous sommes embrassés parce que nous avions froid. Tu sais bien que nous nous embrassions tous les soirs en nous séparant.,""" I love you ! he whispered. I am your brother. Why do you say we just did wrong? We kissed because we were cold. You know very well that we kissed every evening when we separated.","“I love you,” he whispered, “I am your brother. Why say that we have been doing wrong? We kissed each other because we were cold.

We kissed because we were cold. You know we kissed each other every night before we went home.’"
« As-tu l’argent ?,"""Do you have the money?","He tried to pour a few drops of reddish liquid between aunt Dide’s closely-set teeth, while Macquart again asked his brother: “Have you got the money?”",‘Have you got the money?’
"Pendant toute la matinée, on vit Pierre emplir la mairie de ses allées et venues. Il était absolument seul, dans ce grand bâtiment vide, dont les hautes salles retentissaient longuement du bruit de ses talons. D’ailleurs, toutes les portes étaient ouvertes. Il promenait au milieu de ce désert sa présidence sans conseil, d’un air si pénétré de sa mission, que le concierge, en le rencontrant deux ou trois fois dans les couloirs, le salua d’un air surpris et respectueux. On l’aperçut derrière chaque croisée, et, malgré le froid vif, il parut à plusieurs reprises sur le balcon, avec des liasses de papiers dans les mains, comme un homme affairé qui attend des messages importants.","Throughout the morning, Pierre was seen filling the town hall with his comings and goings. He was absolutely alone in this great empty building, whose lofty halls resounded for a long time with the sound of his heels. Besides, all the doors were open. He walked about in the middle of this desert without advice, with an air so imbued with his mission, that the concierge, meeting him two or three times in the corridors, saluted him with a surprised and respectful air. He was seen behind every window, and, in spite of the sharp cold, he appeared on the balcony several times, with bundles of papers in his hands, like a busy man awaiting important messages.","During the whole morning Pierre was seen animating the town-hall with his goings and comings. He was absolutely alone in the large, empty building, whose lofty halls reechoed with the noise of his heels. All the doors were left open.

"La position particulière du marquis fit de lui, à Plassans, dès les premiers jours de la République, l’agent actif du mouvement réactionnaire. Ce petit homme remuant, qui avait tout à gagner au retour de ses rois légitimes, s’occupa avec fièvre du triomphe de leur cause. Tandis que la noblesse riche du quartier Saint-Marc s’endormait dans son désespoir muet, craignant peut-être de se compromettre et de se voir de nouveau condamnée à l’exil, lui se multipliait, faisait de la propagande, racolait des fidèles. Il fut une arme dont une main invisible tenait la poignée. Dès lors, ses visites chez les Rougon devinrent quotidiennes. Il lui fallait un centre d’opérations. Son parent, M. de Valqueyras, lui ayant défendu d’introduire des affiliés dans son hôtel, il avait choisi le salon jaune de Félicité. D’ailleurs, il ne tarda pas à trouver dans Pierre un aide précieux. Il ne pouvait aller prêcher lui-même la cause de la légitimité aux petits détaillants et aux ouvriers du vieux quartier ; on l’aurait hué. Pierre, au contraire, qui avait vécu au milieu de ces gens-là, parlait leur langue, connaissait leurs besoins, arrivait à les catéchiser en douceur. Il devint ainsi l’homme indispensable. En moins de quinze jours, les Rougon furent plus royalistes que le roi. Le marquis, en voyant le zèle de Pierre, s’était finement abrité derrière lui. À quoi bon se mettre en vue, quand un homme à fortes épaules veut bien endosser toutes les sottises d’un parti ? Il laissa Pierre trôner, se gonfler d’importance, parler en maître, se contentant de le retenir ou de le jeter en avant, selon les nécessités de la cause. Aussi l’ancien marchand d’huile fut-il bientôt un personnage. Le soir, quand ils se retrouvaient seuls, Félicité lui disait :","The particular position of the marquis made him, in Plassans, from the first days of the Republic, the active agent of the reactionary movement. This restless little man, who had everything to gain from the return of his legitimate kings, busied himself feverishly with the triumph of their cause. While the wealthy nobility of the Saint-Marc district fell asleep in their mute despair, perhaps fearing to compromise themselves and to see themselves again condemned to exile, he multiplied, made propaganda, solicited the faithful. He was a weapon whose handle was held by an invisible hand. From then on, his visits to the Rougons became daily. He needed an operations center. His relative, M. de Valqueyras, having forbidden him to introduce affiliates into his hotel, he had chosen the yellow salon of Félicité. Moreover, he was not long in finding in Pierre a precious help. He could not himself preach the cause of legitimacy to small retailers and workers in the old quarter; we would have booed him. Pierre, on the contrary, who had lived among these people, spoke their language, knew their needs, managed to catechize them gently. He thus became the indispensable man. In less than a fortnight the Rougons were more royalist than the king. The marquis, on seeing Pierre's zeal, shrewdly took shelter behind him. What's the point of showing off when a man with strong shoulders is willing to endorse all the foolishness of a party? He left Pierre enthroned, to swell with importance, to speak as a master, contenting himself with restraining him or throwing him forward, according to the necessities of the cause. Also the former oil merchant was soon a character. In the evening, when they found themselves alone, Félicité would say to him:","The marquis’s peculiar position qualified him to act as an energetic agent of the reactionary movement at Plassans from the first days of the Republic. This bustling little man, who had everything to gain from the return of his legitimate sovereigns, worked assiduously for their cause. While the wealthy nobility of the Saint-Marc quarter were slumbering in mute despair, fearing, perhaps that they might compromise themselves and again be condemned to exile, he multiplied himself, as it were, spread the propaganda and rallied faithful ones together. He was a weapon whose hilt was held by an invisible hand. From that time forward he paid daily visits to the Rougons. He required a centre of operations. His relative, Monsieur de Valqueyras, had forbidden him to bring any of his associates into his house, so he had chosen Félicité’s yellow drawing-room. Moreover, he very soon found Pierre a valuable assistant. He could not go himself and preach the cause of Legitimacy to the petty traders and workmen of the old quarter; they would have hooted him. Pierre, on the other hand, who had lived among these people, spoke their language and knew their wants, was able to catechise them in a friendly way. He thus became an indispensable man. In less than a fortnight the Rougons were more determined royalists than the king himself. The marquis, perceiving Pierre’s zeal, shrewdly sheltered himself behind him. What was the use of making himself conspicuous, when a man with such broad shoulders was willing to bear on them the burden of all the follies of a party? He allowed Pierre to reign, puff himself out with importance and speak with authority, content to restrain or urge him on, according to the necessities of the cause. Thus, the old oil-dealer soon became a personage of mark. In the evening, when they were alone, Félicité used to say to him: “Go on, don’t be frightened.","The Marquis’s peculiar position meant that he became an active agent of the reactionary movement in Plassans from the very beginning of the Republic. This busy little man, who had everything to gain from the return of his legitimate sovereigns, worked tirelessly for their cause. While the wealthy nobility of the Saint-Marc quarter were sunk in despair, fearing perhaps that they might compromise themselves and again be condemned to exile, he seemed to be everywhere, spreading propaganda and rallying the faithful. He was a weapon whose hilt was held by an invisible hand. From that time onwards he paid daily visits to the Rougons. He required a centre of operations. His relative, Monsieur de Valqueyras, had forbidden him to bring any of his associates into his house, so he had chosen Félicité’s yellow drawing-room. Furthermore, he soon found Pierre a valuable associate. He could not go himself and preach the cause of Legitimacy to the traders and workmen in the old quarter; they would have laughed at him. But Pierre, who had lived among these people, spoke their language and knew their needs, was able to proselytize them in a perfectly amicable way. He became indispensable. In less than two weeks the Rougons were more royalist than the King. The Marquis, seeing Pierre’s zeal, shrewdly hid behind him. Why expose himself when a man with such broad shoulders was willing to bear the brunt? He allowed Pierre to puff himself up with self-importance and speak with authority, content to restrain him or urge him on according to the needs of the cause. Thus, the former oil-dealer soon became quite a prominent personality in the town. In the evening, when they were alone, Félicité would say to him:"
"Quand tous deux ils nageaient sans bruit, Miette croyait voir, aux deux bords, les feuillages s’épaissir, se pencher vers eux, draper leur retraite de rideaux énormes. Et les jours de lune, des lueurs glissaient entre les troncs, des apparitions douces se promenaient le long des rives en robe blanche. Miette n’avait pas peur. Elle éprouvait une émotion indéfinissable à suivre les jeux de l’ombre. Tandis qu’elle avançait, d’un mouvement ralenti, l’eau calme, dont la lune faisait un clair miroir, se froissait à son approche comme une étoffe lamée d’argent ; les ronds s’élargissaient, se perdaient dans les ténèbres des bords, sous les branches pendantes des saules, où l’on entendait des clapotements mystérieux ; et, à chaque brassée, elle trouvait ainsi des trous pleins de voix, des enfoncements noirs devant lesquels elle passait avec plus de hâte, des bouquets, des rangées d’arbres, dont les masses sombres changeaient de forme, s’allongeaient, avaient l’air de la suivre du haut de la berge. Quand elle se mettait sur le dos, les profondeurs du ciel l’attendrissaient encore. De la campagne, des horizons qu’elle ne voyait plus, elle entendait alors monter une voix grave, prolongée, faite de tous les soupirs de la nuit.","When they both swam noiselessly, Miette thought she saw, on either side, the foliage growing thicker, leaning towards them, draping their retreat with enormous curtains. And on moonlit days, gleams slipped between the trunks, gentle apparitions strolled along the banks in white robes. Miette was not afraid. She felt an indefinable emotion to follow the games of the shadows. As she advanced, with a sluggish movement, the calm water, of which the moon made a clear mirror, crumpled at her approach like a silver laminated cloth; the circles widened, were lost in the darkness of the edges, under the hanging branches of the willows, where one heard mysterious lappings; and, with each armful, she thus found holes full of voices, black recesses past which she passed with more haste, clumps, rows of trees, whose dark masses changed shape, lengthened, had the seem to follow her from the top of the bank. When she lay on her back, the depths of the sky still softened her. From the countryside, from horizons that she no longer saw, she then heard a deep, prolonged voice rising, made up of all the sighs of the night.","As she and Silvère swam noiselessly along, she seemed to see the foliage of both banks thicken and hang over them, draping them round as with a huge curtain. When the moon shone, its rays glided between the trunks of the trees, and phantoms seemed to flit along the river-side in white robes. Miette felt no nervousness, however, only an indefinable emotion as she followed the play of the shadows. As she went onward with slower motion, the calm water, which the moon converted into a bright mirror, rippled at her approach like a silver-broidered cloth; eddies widened and lost themselves amid the shadows of the banks, under the hanging willow branches, whence issued weird, plashing sounds. At every stroke she perceived recesses full of sound; dark cavities which she hastened to pass by; clusters and rows of trees, whose sombre masses were continually changing form, stretching forward and apparently following her from the summit of the bank. And when she threw herself on her back, the depths of the heavens affected her still more. From the fields, from the distant horizon, which she could no longer see, a solemn lingering strain, composed of all the sighs of the night, was wafted to her.","As she and Silvère swam noiselessly along she seemed to see the foliage of both banks thicken and hang over them, as if draping a huge curtain over their hideaway.

She felt an indescribable emotion as she watched the play of shadows. As she moved forward more slowly the calm water, which the moon had turned into a bright mirror, rippled at her approach like a silver-broidered cloth; eddies widened and disappeared in the shadows of the banks, under the hanging willow branches from which strange lapping sounds could be heard; at every stroke she could see recesses full of voices, dark cavities she hastened to pass by, and groups of trees whose mysterious shapes were continually changing, stretching forward and seeming to follow her from the top of the bank.

From the fields, from the distant horizon which she could no longer see, she could hear a solemn lingering strain, composed of all the sighs of the night."
"– On aura modifié le plan de campagne, répondit Silvère ; nous devions, en effet, nous porter sur le chef-lieu par la route de Toulon, en prenant à gauche de Plassans et d’Orchères.

"Pascal suivait la crise d’un œil attentif. Les deux frères, très effrayés, ne saisissant que des phrases décousues, s’étaient réfugiés dans un coin de la pièce. Quand Rougon entendit le mot de gendarme, il crut comprendre ; depuis le meurtre de son amant à la frontière, tante Dide nourrissait une haine profonde contre les gendarmes et les douaniers, qu’elle confondait dans une même pensée de vengeance.","Pascal followed the crisis with an attentive eye.

"Alors il expliqua longuement comment les insurgés s’étaient réveillés et comment on les avait mis en joue pour les réduire à l’impuissance. Il ajouta que le sang n’avait pas coulé, heureusement.

« Et Silvère ? » lui demanda-t-elle.,“And Silvere? she asked him.,And Silvère?” The young man started with surprise at the question.,"‘What happened to Silvère?’ The young man, startled by the question, replied, also in a whisper:"

"Le champ mort et désert, où les frelons autrefois bourdonnaient seuls autour des fleurs grasses, dans le silence écrasant du soleil, est ainsi devenu un lieu retentissant, qu’emplissent de bruit les querelles des bohémiens et les cris aigus des jeunes vauriens du faubourg. Une scierie, qui débite dans un coin les poutres du chantier, grince, servant de basse sourde et continue aux voix aigres. Cette scierie est toute primitive : la pièce de bois est posée sur deux tréteaux élevés, et deux scieurs de long, l’un en haut, monté sur la poutre même, l’autre en bas, aveuglé par la sciure qui tombe, impriment à une large et forte lame de scie un continuel mouvement de va-et-vient. Pendant des heures, ces hommes se plient, pareils à des pantins articulés, avec une régularité et une sécheresse de machine. Le bois qu’ils débitent est rangé, le long de la muraille du fond, par tas hauts de deux ou trois mètres, et méthodiquement construits, planche à planche, en forme de cube parfait. Ces sortes de meules carrées, qui restent souvent là plusieurs saisons, rongées d’herbes au ras du sol, sont un des charmes de l’aire Saint-Mittre. Elles ménagent des sentiers mystérieux, étroits et discrets, qui conduisent à une allée plus large, laissée entre les tas et la muraille. C’est un désert, une bande de verdure d’où l’on ne voit que des morceaux de ciel. Dans cette allée, dont les murs sont tendus de mousse et dont le sol semble couvert d’un tapis de haute laine, règnent encore la végétation puissante et le silence frissonnant de l’ancien cimetière. On y sent courir ces souffles chauds et vagues des voluptés de la mort qui sortent des vieilles tombes chauffées par les grands soleils. Il n’y a pas, dans la campagne de Plassans, un endroit plus ému, plus vibrant de tiédeur, de solitude et d’amour. C’est là où il est exquis d’aimer. Lorsqu’on vida le cimetière, on dut entasser les ossements dans ce coin, car il n’est pas rare, encore aujourd’hui, en fouillant du pied l’herbe humide, d’y déterrer des fragments de crâne.","The dead and deserted field, where the hornets once buzzed alone around the lush flowers, in the crushing silence of the sun, has thus become a resounding place, filled with noise by the quarrels of the gypsies and the shrill cries of the young scoundrels of the suburb. A sawmill, which cuts into a corner the beams of the construction site, creaks, serving as a dull bass and continues to the shrill voices. This sawmill is very primitive: the piece of wood is placed on two high trestles, and two long sawyers, one at the top, mounted on the beam itself, the other at the bottom, blinded by the sawdust which falls, print at a wide and strong saw blade a continuous back and forth movement. For hours, these men bend, like articulated puppets, with the regularity and dryness of a machine. The wood they chop is ranged along the back wall, in heaps two or three meters high, and methodically constructed, plank by plank, in the shape of a perfect cube. These kinds of square millstones, which often remain there for several seasons, gnawed with grass at ground level, are one of the charms of the Saint-Mittre area. They arrange mysterious, narrow and discreet paths, which lead to a wider alley, left between the heaps and the wall. It is a desert, a strip of greenery from which you can only see bits of sky. In this alley, whose walls are covered with moss and whose floor seems covered with a carpet of high wool, still reign the powerful vegetation and the shivering silence of the old cemetery. You can feel the warm, vague breaths of the voluptuousness of death running through it, issuing from old tombs warmed by the great suns. In the countryside of Plassans, there is no place more moved, more vibrant with warmth, solitude and love. This is where it is exquisite to love. When the cemetery was emptied, the bones must have been piled up in this corner, because it is not uncommon, even today, when digging in the damp grass, to unearth fragments of skulls.","The field, formerly so still and deserted, save for the buzzing of hornets around the rich blossoms in the heavy sunshine, has thus become a very rowdy spot, resounding with the noisy quarrels of the gipsies and the shrill cries of the urchins of the suburb. In one corner there is a primitive saw-mill for cutting the timber, the noise from which serves as a dull, continuous bass accompaniment to the sharp voices. The wood is placed on two high tressels, and a couple of sawyers, one of whom stands aloft on the timber itself, while the other underneath is half blinded by the falling sawdust, work a large saw to and fro for hours together, with rigid machine-like regularity, as if they were wire-pulled puppets. The wood they saw is stacked, plank by plank, along the wall at the end, in carefully arranged piles six or eight feet high, which often remain there several seasons, and constitute one of the charms of the Aire Saint-Mittre. Between these stacks are mysterious, retired little alleys leading to a broader path between the timber and the wall, a deserted strip of verdure whence only small patches of sky can be seen. The vigorous vegetation and the quivering, deathlike stillness of the old cemetery still reign in this path. In all the country round Plassans there is no spot more instinct with languor, solitude, and love. It is a most delightful place for love-making. When the cemetery was being cleared the bones must have been heaped up in this corner; for even to-day it frequently happens that one’s foot comes across some fragment of a skull lying concealed in the damp turf.","The field, which used to be so dead and deserted except for the buzzing of hornets round the rich blossoms in the crushing, silent heat of the sun, has thus become a very noisy spot, resounding with the quarrels of the gypsies and the shrieks of the little devils from the Faubourg. In one corner a sawmill turns out the beams for the yard, its grinding noise providing a continuous bass accompaniment to the shrill voices. The mill is quite primitive. The wood is placed on two high trestles, and a couple of sawyers, one of whom stands on the timber itself while the other, down on the ground, is blinded by the shower of sawdust, work a large saw backwards and forwards for hours, with machine-like regularity, as if they were wire puppets. The sawn wood is stacked, plank by plank, along the wall at the end, in neat piles two or three metres high, forming perfect cubes. These stacks, like square hayricks, often remain there for several seasons, with weeds growing up at the bottom, and are one of the charms of the Aire Saint-Mittre. Winding through them are mysterious little pathways that lead to a lane between the timber and the wall, a deserted strip of greenery from which only small patches of sky are visible. The thick vegetation and the eerie stillness of the old cemetery can still be seen and felt in this lane, where the walls are covered in moss and the ground seems like a woollen carpet. On the hottest days you can feel the warm, voluptuous breath of the dead rising from the old graves. Around Plassans there is no spot more exciting, more alive with emotion, so heavy with warmth, solitude, and love. It is a wonderful place for lovers. When the cemetery was being cleared the bones must have been piled up in this corner, for even today people feeling in the wet grass with their feet often kick up fragments of skull."

"Ils restaient muets, étroitement serrés l’un contre l’autre. Miette avait dit : « Réchauffons-nous comme cela », et ils attendaient innocemment d’avoir chaud. Des tiédeurs leur vinrent bientôt à travers leurs vêtements ; ils sentirent peu à peu leur étreinte les brûler, ils entendirent leurs poitrines se soulever d’un même souffle. Une langueur les envahit, qui les plongea dans une somnolence fiévreuse. Ils avaient chaud maintenant ; des lueurs passaient devant leurs paupières closes, des bruits confus montaient à leur cerveau. Cet état de bien-être douloureux, qui dura quelques minutes, leur parut sans fin. Et alors ce fut dans une sorte de rêve, que leurs lèvres se rencontrèrent. Leur baiser fut long, avide. Il leur sembla que jamais ils ne s’étaient embrassés. Ils souffraient, ils se séparèrent. Puis, quand le froid de la nuit eut glacé leur fièvre, ils demeurèrent à quelque distance l’un de l’autre, dans une grande confusion.","They remained silent, tightly pressed against each other. Miette had said, ""Let's warm up like this,"" and they were innocently waiting to get warm. Warmths soon came to them through their clothes; little by little they felt their embrace burn them, they heard their chests heave with the same breath. A languor invaded them, which plunged them into a feverish drowsiness. They were warm now; lights passed before their closed eyelids, confused noises rose to their brains. This state of painful well-being, which lasted a few minutes, seemed endless to them. And then it was in a kind of dream, that their lips met. Their kiss was long, eager. It seemed to them that they had never kissed. They suffered, they separated. Then, when the cold of the night had frozen their fever, they remained at some distance from each other, in great confusion.","They remained silent, close to one another. A gentle glow soon penetrated them, languor overcame them, and steeped them in feverish drowsiness. They were quite warm at last, and lights seemed to flit before their closed eyelids, while a buzzing mounted to their brains. This state of painful ecstasy, which lasted some minutes, seemed endless to them. Then, in a kind of dream, their lips met. The kiss they exchanged was long and greedy. It seemed to them as if they had never kissed before. Yet their embrace was fraught with suffering and they released one another. And the chilliness of the night having cooled their fever, they remained in great confusion at some distance one from the other.","They remained silent, close to each other. Miette said: ‘Let’s get warm like this,’ and they innocently waited to feel warm. A gentle glow soon penetrated their clothes; they gradually felt as if their embrace was burning them, and they heard their breathing seem to become as one. They were overcome with drowsiness. They were quite warm at last. Lights seemed to flit before their closed eyelids, while a buzzing sounded in their ears. This painful state of ecstasy, which lasted several minutes, seemed endless. Then, in a kind of dream, their lips met. The kiss they exchanged was long and greedy. It seemed to them as if they had never kissed before. They were troubled and drew apart. When the cold night air had cooled their fever they remained at some distance from each other, deeply embarrassed."
"La seconde fille, Gervaise, née l’année suivante, était bancale de naissance. Conçue dans l’ivresse, sans doute pendant une de ces nuits honteuses où les époux s’assommaient, elle avait la cuisse droite déviée et amaigrie, étrange reproduction héréditaire des brutalités que sa mère avait eu à endurer dans une heure de lutte et de soûlerie furieuse. Gervaise resta chétive, et Fine, la voyant toute pâle et toute faible, la mit au régime de l’anisette, sous prétexte qu’elle avait besoin de prendre des forces. La pauvre créature se dessécha davantage. C’était une grande fille fluette dont les robes, toujours trop larges, flottaient comme vides. Sur son corps émacié et contrefait, elle avait une délicieuse tête de poupée, une petite face ronde et blême d’une exquise délicatesse. Son infirmité était presque une grâce ; sa taille fléchissait doucement à chaque pas, dans une sorte de balancement cadencé.","The second daughter, Gervaise, born the following year, was wobbly from birth. Conceived in intoxication, no doubt during one of those shameful nights when spouses were knocked out, her right thigh was deviated and wasted, a strange hereditary reproduction of the brutalities her mother had had to endure in an hour of struggle and drunkenness. furious. Gervaise remained weak, and Fine, seeing her very pale and very weak, put her on an anisette diet, on the pretext that she needed to gain strength. The poor creature withered further. She was a tall, slender girl whose dresses, always too large, floated as if empty. On her emaciated, misshapen body she had a delicious doll's head, a round, pallid little face of exquisite delicacy.

Gervaise remained puny, and Fine, observing her pallor and weakness, put her on a course of aniseed, under the pretext that she required something to strengthen her. But the poor child became still more emaciated. She was a tall, lank girl, whose frocks, invariably too large, hung round her as if they had nothing under them. Above a deformed and puny body she had a sweet little doll-like head, a tiny round face, pale and exquisitely delicate. Her infirmity almost became graceful.

"Elle disait cela avec une ironie si fine, que son mari ne sentit pas la cruauté de ses railleries. Il éprouva simplement un grand remords. Et, tout d’un coup, il se confessa. Il parla des lettres d’Eugène, il expliqua ses plans, sa conduite, avec la loquacité d’un homme qui fait son examen de conscience et qui implore un sauveur. À chaque instant, il s’interrompait pour demander : « Qu’aurais-tu fait, toi, à ma place ? » ou bien il s’écriait : « N’est-ce pas ? j’avais raison, je ne pouvais agir autrement. » Félicité ne daignait pas même faire un signe. Elle écoutait, avec la roideur rechignée d’un juge. Au fond, elle goûtait des jouissances exquises ; elle le tenait donc enfin, ce gros sournois ; elle en jouait comme une chatte joue d’une boule de papier ; et il tendait les mains pour qu’elle lui mît des menottes.","She said this with such subtle irony that her husband did not feel the cruelty of her raillery.

"Silvère, qui comprenait vaguement le danger de ces extases, se levait parfois d’un bond en proposant de passer dans une des petites îles que les eaux basses découvraient au milieu de la rivière. Tous deux, les pieds nus, s’aventuraient ; Miette se moquait des cailloux, elle ne voulait pas que Silvère la soutînt, et il lui arriva une fois de s’asseoir au beau milieu du courant ; mais il n’y avait pas vingt centimètres d’eau, elle en fut quitte pour faire sécher sa première jupe. Puis, quand ils étaient dans l’île, ils se couchaient à plat ventre sur une langue de sable, les yeux au niveau de la surface de l’eau, dont ils regardaient au loin, dans la nuit claire, frémir les écailles d’argent. Alors Miette déclarait qu’elle était en bateau, l’île marchait pour sûr ; elle la sentait bien qui l’emportait ; ce vertige que leur donnait le grand ruissellement dont leurs yeux s’emplissaient les amusait un instant, les tenait là, sur le bord, chantant à demi-voix, ainsi que les bateliers dont les rames battent l’eau. D’autres fois, quand l’île avait une berge basse, ils s’y asseyaient comme sur un banc de verdure, laissant pendre leurs pieds nus dans le courant. Et, pendant des heures, ils causaient, faisant jaillir l’eau à coups de talon, balançant les jambes, prenant plaisir à déchaîner des tempêtes dans le bassin paisible dont la fraîcheur calmait leur fièvre.","Silvère, who vaguely understood the danger of these ecstasies, sometimes leapt to his feet, proposing to pass over one of the little islands which the low waters revealed in the middle of the river. Both of them ventured barefoot; Miette didn't care about the pebbles, she didn't want Silvere to support her, and once she happened to sit down in the middle of the current; but there was not twenty centimeters of water, she got off with drying her first skirt. Then, when they were on the island, they lay down on their stomachs on a spit of sand, their eyes level with the surface of the water, of which they watched in the distance, in the clear night, the scales of money. Then Miette declared that she was in a boat, the island was going for sure; she knew who was winning; the dizziness given them by the great stream which filled their eyes amused them for a moment, kept them there, on the edge, singing in an undertone, like the boatmen whose oars beat the water. At other times, when the island had a low shore, they would sit there as if on a bank of greenery, letting their bare feet dangle in the current. And for hours they talked, spurting the water with their heels, swinging their legs, taking pleasure in unleashing storms in the peaceful pool whose coolness calmed their fever.","Silvère, who vaguely understood the danger of these ecstasies, would sometimes jump up and propose to cross over to one of the islets left by the low water in the middle of the stream.

Then, having reached the island, they threw themselves on the long neck of sand, their eyes on a level with the surface of the river whose silvery scales they saw quivering far away in the clear night. Then Miette would declare that they were in a boat, that the island was certainly floating; she could feel it carrying her along. The dizziness caused by the rippling of the water amused them for a moment, and they lingered there, singing in an undertone, like boatmen as they strike the water with their oars. At other times, when the island had a low bank, they sat there as on a bed of verdure, and let their bare feet dangle in the stream.

"C’était encore vrai. Une bande devait suivre la Viorne et passer, à ce moment, au bas même de la ville ; le cri : « Aux armes, citoyens ! formez vos bataillons ! » arrivait, par bouffées, avec une netteté vibrante. Ce fut une nuit atroce. Ces messieurs la passèrent, accoudés sur le parapet de la terrasse, glacés par le terrible froid qu’il faisait, ne pouvant s’arracher au spectacle de cette plaine toute secouée par le tocsin et la Marseillaise, tout enflammée par l’illumination des signaux. Ils s’emplirent les yeux de cette mer lumineuse, piquée de flammes sanglantes ; ils se firent sonner les oreilles, à écouter cette clameur vague ; au point que leurs sens se faussaient, qu’ils voyaient et entendaient d’effrayantes choses. Pour rien au monde, ils n’auraient quitté la place ; s’ils avaient tourné le dos, ils se seraient imaginé qu’une armée était à leurs trousses. Comme certains poltrons, ils voulaient voir venir le danger, sans doute pour prendre la fuite au bon moment. Aussi, vers le matin, quand la lune fut couchée, et qu’ils n’eurent plus devant eux qu’un abîme noir, ils éprouvèrent des transes horribles. Ils se croyaient entourés d’ennemis invisibles qui rampaient dans l’ombre, prêts à leur sauter à la gorge. Au moindre bruit, c’étaient des hommes qui se consultaient au bas de la terrasse, avant de l’escalader. Et rien, rien que du noir, dans lequel ils fixaient éperdument leurs regards. Le marquis, comme pour les consoler, leur disait de sa voix ironique :","It was still true. A band was to follow the Viorne and pass, at this moment, at the very bottom of the town; the cry: ""To arms, citizens!"" form your battalions! came, in bursts, with vibrant clarity. It was an awful night. These gentlemen passed it, leaning on the parapet of the terrace, frozen by the terrible cold it was, unable to tear themselves away from the spectacle of this plain all shaken by the tocsin and the Marseillaise, all inflamed by the illumination of the signals. . They filled their eyes with this luminous sea, pierced with bloody flames; they made their ears ring, listening to this vague clamor; so that their senses were distorted, that they saw and heard frightful things. For nothing in the world would they have left the square; if they had turned their backs, they would have imagined that an army was on their heels. Like some cowards, they wanted to see danger coming, no doubt to flee at the right time. Also, towards morning, when the moon had set, and they had before them only a black abyss, they experienced horrible trances. They thought they were surrounded by invisible enemies crawling in the shadows, ready to jump at their throats. At the slightest noise, men were consulting one another at the bottom of the terrace, before climbing it. And nothing, nothing but black, into which they stared wildly. The marquis, as if to console them, said to them in his ironic voice:","It was indeed true. A detachment must have been following the course of the Viorne, passing, at that moment, just under the town. The cry, “To arms, citizens! Form your battalions!” reached the on-lookers in sudden bursts with vibrating distinctness. Ah! what an awful night it was! The gentlemen spent it leaning over the parapet of the terrace, numbed by the terrible cold, and yet quite unable to tear themselves away from the sight of that plain which resounded with the tocsin and the “Marseillaise,” and was all ablaze with signal-fires. They feasted their eyes upon that sea of light, flecked with blood-red flames; and they strained their ears in order to listen to the confused clamour, till at last their senses began to deceive them, and they saw and heard the most frightful things. Nothing in the world would have induced them to leave the spot. If they had turned their backs, they would have fancied that a whole army was at their heels. After the manner of a certain class of cowards, they wished to witness the approach of the danger, in order that they might take flight at the right moment. Towards morning, when the moon had set and they could see nothing in front of them but a dark void, they fell into a terrible fright. They fancied they were surrounded by invisible enemies, who were crawling along in the darkness, ready to fly at their throats. At the slightest noise they imagined there were enemies deliberating beneath the terrace, prior to scaling it. Yet there was nothing, nothing but darkness upon which they fixed their eyes distractedly. The marquis, as if to console them, said in his ironical way: “Don’t be uneasy!","Indeed so. A detachment must have been following the course of the Viorne and, at that moment, was passing just under the town; the cry, ‘To arms, citizens! Form your battalions!’ reached the onlookers in sudden bursts and with resounding clarity. What a dreadful night! The councillors spent it leaning over the parapet of the terrace, frozen by the terrible cold and yet unable to tear themselves away from the sight of the plain, which reverberated with the tocsin and the Marseillaise and was ablaze with signal-fires. Their eyes were fixed on that sea of light, flecked with blood-red flames; and they strained their ears to listen to the confused clamour, until at last their senses began to deceive them and they saw and heard the most frightful things. Nothing in the world would have induced them to leave that spot; if they had turned their backs they would have imagined that a whole army was at their heels. Like certain types of coward, they wanted a clear view of the danger approaching so that they could take flight at the right moment. Thus, towards morning, when the moon had set and they could see nothing in front of them but a dark void, they became sick with fear. They fancied they were surrounded by invisible enemies crawling along in the dark, ready to grab them by the throat at any moment. At the slightest noise they imagined there were men conferring beneath the terrace before scaling it. Yet there was nothing, nothing but darkness into which they stared like men in a trance. The Marquis, as if to console them, said in his ironic voice:"
« Ah !… c’est décidé… voilà ton fusil… »,"""Ah!...it's decided...here's your gun...""",There’s your gun!”,So it’s decided? There’s your gun!’
"Il avait prononcé ces paroles avec une telle âpreté, que sa mère, dans cet appétit brûlant du succès, reconnut le cri de son sang. Elle murmura :","He had uttered these words with such bitterness that his mother, in this burning appetite for success, recognized the cry of his blood. She whispered:","He spoke these words so sharply, with such a keen longing for success, that his mother recognised the cry of her own blood. “Your father is very brave,” she whispered.","He pronounced these words with such intensity that his mother saw her own craving for success reflected in them. ‘Your father is very brave,’ she whispered."
"Lorsque la nuit tombe, l’aire Saint-Mittre se vide, se creuse, pareille à un grand trou noir. Au fond, on n’aperçoit plus que la lueur mourante du feu des bohémiens. Par moments, des ombres disparaissent silencieusement dans la masse épaisse des ténèbres. L’hiver surtout, le lieu devient sinistre.","When night falls, the Saint-Mittre area empties, widens, like a big black hole. In the background, you can only see the dying glow of the fire of the gypsies. At times, shadows silently disappear into the thick mass of darkness. Especially in winter, the place becomes grim.","When night falls the Aire Saint-Mittre loses its animation, and looks like some great black hole.

"– Je sais, murmura Miette, tu es bon, tu me tends la main. Mais que veux-tu ? j’ai des craintes, je me sens des révoltes, parfois. Il me semble qu’on m’a fait tort, et alors j’ai des envies d’être méchante. Je t’ouvre mon cœur, à toi. Chaque fois qu’on me jette le nom de mon père au visage, j’éprouve une brûlure par tout le corps. Quand je passe et que les gamins crient : Eh ! la Chantegreil ! cela me met hors de moi ; je voudrais les tenir pour les battre. »","- I know, murmured Miette, you are good, you hold out your hand to me. But what do you want? I have fears, I feel revolts, sometimes. It seems to me that I have been wronged, and then I feel like being mean. I open my heart to you. Every time my father's name is thrown in my face, I feel a burn all over my body. When I pass and the kids shout: Hey! Chantegreil! it drives me mad; I would like to hold them to defeat them. »","“I know,” murmured Miette. “You are so kind, you sustain me. But what am I to do? I sometimes have fears and feelings of revolt. I think at times that I have been wronged, and then I should like to do something wicked. You see I pour forth my heart to you. Whenever my father’s name is thrown in my face, I feel my whole body burning. When the urchins cry at me as I pass, ‘Eh, La Chantegreil,’ I lose all control of myself, and feel that I should like to lay hold of them and whip them.”","‘I know,’ murmured Miette. ‘You’re so good, you do your best to reassure me. But I can’t help it. I sometimes get very angry. I think I’ve been wronged, and then I feel like doing something bad. I’m telling you exactly how I feel. Every time my father’s name is thrown in my face , it’s as if my whole body is on fire. When the young kids shout at me when I walk past: “Hey, La Chantegreil!” I just lose control; I want to grab hold of them and hit them.’"
"« Je vous remercie bien, monsieur, répondit Rengade ; mais, voyez-vous, ce qui me soulagerait mieux que tous les remèdes, ce serait de tordre le cou au misérable qui m’a crevé l’œil. Oh ! je le reconnaîtrai ; c’est un petit maigre, pâlot, tout jeune… »","“I thank you very much, sir,” replied Rengade; but, you see, what would relieve me better than all the remedies would be to wring the neck of the wretch who gouged out my eye. Oh ! I will recognize him; He's a little thin, pale, very young...""","“I’m much obliged to you, sir,” Rengade replied; “but, you know, what would do me more good than any quantity of doctor ’s stuff would be to wring the neck of the villain who put my eye out.

I shall know him again; he’s a little thin, palish fellow, quite young.”","‘I’m very grateful, sir,’ Rengade replied, ‘but you know, what would do me more good than any amount of doctor ’s advice would be to wring the neck of the bastard who put my eye out. I’d certainly recognize him; he’s a thin little thing, quite fair-skinned, and very young...’"
"Cependant, un hurlement était monté dans la nuit. Les républicains surpris, criant à la trahison, avaient lâché leur feu à leur tour. Un garde national vint tomber sous le porche. Mais eux, ils laissaient trois morts. Ils prirent la fuite, se heurtant aux cadavres, affolés, répétant dans les ruelles silencieuses : « On assassine nos frères ! » d’une voix désespérée qui ne trouvait pas d’écho. Les défenseurs de l’ordre, ayant eu le temps de recharger leurs armes, se précipitèrent alors sur la place vide, comme des furieux, et envoyèrent des balles à tous les angles des rues, aux endroits où le noir d’une porte, l’ombre d’une lanterne, la saillie d’une borne, leur faisaient voir des insurgés. Ils restèrent là, dix minutes, à décharger leurs fusils dans le vide.","However, a howl had risen in the night. The surprised Republicans, crying treason, had unleashed their fire in their turn. A national guard fell under the porch. But they left three dead. They fled, colliding with the corpses, panicked, repeating in the silent alleys: “We are murdering our brothers! in a desperate voice that found no echo. The defenders of order, having had time to reload their weapons, then rushed into the empty square, like furious people, and sent bullets to all the corners of the streets, to the places where the blackness of a door, the The shadow of a lantern, the projection of a milestone, showed them insurgents. They stayed there for ten minutes, discharging their guns into space.","In the meantime a loud howl had arisen amid the darkness. The surprised Republicans shouted treachery, and fired in their turn. A national guard fell under the porch. But the Republicans, on their side, had three dead. They took to flight, stumbling over the corpses, stricken with panic, and shouting through the quiet lanes: “Our brothers are being murdered!” in despairing voices which found no echo. Thereupon the defenders of order, having had time to reload their weapons, rushed into the empty square, firing at every street corner, wherever the darkness of a door, the shadow of a lamp-post, or the jutting of a stone made them fancy they saw an insurgent. In this wise they remained there ten minutes, firing into space.","In the meantime a great howl was heard in the darkness. The republicans, shouting treachery, had fired in their turn.

"Il entraîna la jeune fille. Arrivé à la halle, il la fit asseoir sur un banc de pierre. Il lui dit de l’attendre là. Il regardait toujours ses mains, il balbutiait. Miette finit par comprendre, à ses paroles entrecoupées, qu’il voulait aller embrasser sa grand-mère avant de partir.","He dragged the girl away. Arrived at the hall, he made her sit down on a stone bench. He tells her to wait there. He was still looking at his hands, he was stammering.

"– Moi, moi ! balbutia-t-il, mais on m’a trompé, on m’a volé ! C’est cet imbécile de Sicardot qui m’a mis dedans, en me jurant que les Napoléon seraient vainqueurs. J’ai cru faire une avance. Mais il faudra bien que cette vieille ganache me rende mon argent.","- Me me ! he stammered, but I was deceived, I was robbed! It was that idiot Sicardot who put me in, swearing to me that the Napoleons would be victorious. I thought I was making a move. But this old ganache will have to give me back my money.","“I, I!” he faltered, “but I was deceived, I was robbed!

"Ce qui a achevé de donner à ce coin perdu un caractère étrange, c’est l’élection de domicile que, par un usage traditionnel, y font les bohémiens de passage. Dès qu’une de ces maisons roulantes, qui contiennent une tribu entière, arrive à Plassans, elle va se remiser au fond de l’aire Saint-Mittre. Aussi la place n’est-elle jamais vide ; il y a toujours là quelque bande aux allures singulières, quelque troupe d’hommes fauves et de femmes horriblement séchées, parmi lesquels on voit se rouler à terre des groupes de beaux enfants. Ce monde vit sans honte, en plein air, devant tous, faisant bouillir leur marmite, mangeant des choses sans nom, étalant leurs nippes trouées, dormant, se battant, s’embrassant, puant la saleté et la misère.","What has finished giving this remote corner a strange character is the choice of domicile that, by traditional use, the bohemians of passage make there. As soon as one of these rolling houses, which contain an entire tribe, arrives at Plassans, it goes to the back of the Saint-Mittre area. So the place is never empty; there is always some strange-looking band there, some troop of wild men and horribly dried-up women, among whom we see groups of beautiful children rolling on the ground. This world lives without shame, in the open air, in front of everyone, boiling their pots, eating nameless things, spreading their holes in clothes, sleeping, fighting, kissing, reeking of filth and misery.","The strangeness of the place is increased by the circumstance that wandering gipsies, by a sort of traditional custom always select the vacant portions of it for their encampments. Whenever any caravan arrives at Plassans it takes up its quarters on the Aire Saint-Mittre. The place is consequently never empty. There is always some strange band there, some troop of wild men and withered women, among whom groups of healthy-looking children roll about on the grass. These people live in the open air, regardless of everybody, setting their pots boiling, eating nameless things, freely displaying their tattered garments, and sleeping, fighting, kissing, and reeking with mingled filth and misery.","This out-of-the-way spot is made even stranger by the fact that travelling gypsies always set up camp there, as if by custom.

There is always some odd-looking crowd there, some troop of wild men and horribly desiccated women, with groups of beautiful children rolling about on the ground. These people live without shame, in the open air, publicly: boiling their pots, eating strange food, laying out their tattered clothes, sleeping, fighting, kissing, reeking of filth and poverty."
"Depuis un instant, des bruits confus venaient de derrière les coteaux, au milieu desquels se perd la route de Nice. C’étaient comme les cahots éloignés d’un convoi de charrettes. La Viorne, d’ailleurs, couvrait de son grondement ces bruits encore indistincts. Mais peu à peu ils s’accentuèrent, ils devinrent pareils aux piétinements d’une armée en marche. Puis on distingua, dans ce roulement continu et croissant, des brouhahas de foule, d’étranges souffles d’ouragan cadencés et rythmiques ; on aurait dit les coups de foudre d’un orage qui s’avançait rapidement, troublant déjà de son approche l’air endormi. Silvère écoutait, ne pouvant saisir ces voix de tempête que les coteaux empêchaient d’arriver nettement jusqu’à lui. Et, tout à coup, une masse noire apparut au coude de la route ; la Marseillaise, chantée avec une furie vengeresse, éclata, formidable.","For a moment confused noises had been coming from behind the hills, in the middle of which the road to Nice was lost. They were like the distant jolting of a cart company. The Viorne, moreover, drowned out these still indistinct noises with its rumble. But little by little they became more accentuated, they became like the trampling of an army on the march. Then one could distinguish, in this continuous and increasing rolling, hubbubs of the crowd, strange cadenced and rhythmic hurricane-like gusts; it sounded like the thunderbolts of a rapidly advancing storm, already disturbing the sleeping air with its approach. Silvère listened, unable to catch those stormy voices which the hillsides prevented from reaching him clearly. And suddenly a black mass appeared at the bend in the road; the Marseillaise, sung with vengeful fury, broke out, formidable.","Confused sounds had for a moment been coming from behind the hills in the midst of which the Nice road wends its way. They suggested the distant jolting of a procession of carts; but not distinctly, so loud was the roaring of the Viorne. Gradually, however, they became more pronounced, and rose at last like the tramping of an army on the march. Then amidst the continuous growing rumble one detected the shouts of a crowd, strange rhythmical blasts as of a hurricane. One could even have fancied they were the thunderclaps of a rapidly approaching storm which was already disturbing the slumbering atmosphere. Silvère listened attentively, unable to tell, however, what were those tempest-like shouts, for the hills prevented them from reaching him distinctly. Suddenly a dark mass appeared at the turn of the road, and then the “Marseillaise” burst forth, formidable, sung as with avenging fury.","For the last few moments, muffled sounds had been coming from behind the hills through which the Nice road disappears from view. It was like the distant jolting of a procession of carts. These sounds, as yet vague, were muffled further by the roar of the Viorne.

Then, in the growing rumble, shouting could be heard, strange rhythmical blasts, as if a gale was blowing. They sounded like the thunderclaps of a rapidly gathering storm that was already disturbing the stillness of the air as it approached. Silvère strained his ears, but was unable to make out the words being shouted by this tempest of voices, which the hillsides prevented from reaching him clearly. Suddenly a dark mass appeared round the bend, and the formidable sound of the Marseillaise, sung with vengeful fury, burst upon the air."
"Puis il aperçut Miette, il ajouta, en s’adressant à M. Garçonnet :","Then he saw Miette, he added, addressing M. Garçonnet:","Then he perceived Miette, and addressing himself to Monsieur Garconnet, he added: “Do you see, sir, that big girl in red over yonder?","Then he caught sight of Miette and, addressing Monsieur Garçonnet, added:"
"L’ancien bonnetier devint grave et se montra dès lors d’une grande politesse. Vuillet étant venu causer avec lui de la récompense méritée que venait de recevoir leur ami, il répondit très haut, de façon à être entendu de Félicité, assise à quelques pas, que des hommes comme Rougon « honoraient la Légion d’honneur ». Le libraire fit chorus ; on lui avait, le matin, donné l’assurance formelle que la clientèle du collège lui était rendue. Quant à Sicardot, il éprouva d’abord un léger ennui à n’être plus le seul homme décoré de la bande. Selon lui, il n’y avait que les militaires qui eussent droit au ruban. Le courage de Pierre le surprenait. Mais, bonhomme au fond, il s’échauffa et finit par crier que les Napoléon savaient distinguer les hommes de cœur et d’énergie.","The former hosier became serious and henceforth showed great politeness. Vuillet having come to talk with him about the deserved reward their friend had just received, he replied very loudly, so as to be heard by Félicité, seated a few steps away, that men like Rougon ""honored the Legion of Honor"". The bookseller joined in; in the morning he had been given the formal assurance that the college clientele had been returned to him. As for Sicardot, he first experienced a slight annoyance at not being the only decorated man in the band. According to him, only soldiers were entitled to the ribbon. Pierre's courage surprised him. But, good man at heart, he grew heated and ended by shouting that the Napoleons knew how to distinguish men of heart and energy.","The old hosier thereupon became grave, and assumed a very affable manner. When Vuillet came and spoke to him of the well-deserved reward that their friend had just received, he replied in a loud voice, so as to be heard by Félicité, who was sitting a little way off, that “men like Rougon were an ornament to the Legion of Honour.” The bookseller joined in the chorus; he had that morning received a formal assurance that the custom of the college would be restored to him. As for Sicardot, he at first felt somewhat annoyed to find himself no longer the only one of the set who was decorated. According to him, none but soldiers had a right to the ribbon. Pierre’s valour surprised him. However, being in reality a good-natured fellow, he at last grew warmer, and ended by saying that the Napoleons always knew how to distinguish men of spirit and energy.","Thereupon the former hosier assumed a serious, respectful air. When Vuillet came up and started talking about the well-deserved reward their friend had just received, he replied in a loud voice, so as to be heard by Félicité who was sitting a few feet away, that ‘men like Rougon did credit to the Legion of Honour’. The bookseller joined in the chorus; that morning he had received a formal assurance that the custom of the college would be his once more. As for Sicardot, he felt at first somewhat annoyed that he was no longer the only member of the group to be decorated. In his view soldiers were the only ones who had a right to the ribbon. Pierre’s valour surprised him. However, being a good-natured fellow he became reconciled to the idea, and ended by saying that Bonapartes knew how to reward men of courage and enterprise."
"Et il l’entraîna dans un coin, en voyant que Vuillet tendait ses larges oreilles. Là, à voix basse, il lui expliqua qu’il était de bonne guerre de laisser derrière les insurgés quelques hommes énergiques, qui pourraient rétablir l’ordre dans la ville. Et comme le farouche commandant s’entêtait à ne pas vouloir déserter son poste, il s’offrit pour se mettre à la tête du corps de réserve.","And he led her into a corner, seeing that Vuillet was straining his broad ears. There, in a low voice, he explained to him that it was fair game to leave behind the insurgents a few energetic men, who could restore order in the city. And as the fierce commander stubbornly refused to desert his post, he offered to put himself at the head of the reserve corps.","He drew him into a corner, on seeing Vuillet prick up his big ears.

"Puis arrivèrent les pluies, les neiges, les gelées. Ces mauvaises humeurs de l’hiver ne les retinrent pas. Miette ne vint plus sans sa grande pelisse brune, et ils se moquèrent tous deux des vilains temps. Quand la nuit était sèche et claire, que de petits souffles soulevaient sous leurs pas une poussière blanche de gelée, et les frappaient au visage comme à coups de baguettes minces, ils se gardaient bien de s’asseoir ; ils allaient et venaient plus vite, enveloppés dans la pelisse, les joues bleuies, les yeux pleurant de froid ; et ils riaient, tout secoués de gaieté par leur marche rapide dans l’air glacé. Un soir de neige, ils s’amusèrent à faire une énorme boule qu’ils roulèrent dans un coin ; elle resta là un grand mois, ce qui les fit s’étonner à chaque nouveau rendez-vous. La pluie ne les effrayait pas davantage. Ils se virent par de terribles averses qui les mouillaient jusqu’aux os. Silvère accourait en se disant que Miette ne ferait pas la folie de venir ; et quand Miette arrivait à son tour, il ne savait plus comment la gronder. Au fond, il l’attendait. Il finit par chercher un abri contre le mauvais temps, sentant bien qu’ils sortiraient quand même, malgré leur promesse mutuelle de ne pas mettre les pieds dehors lorsqu’il pleuvait. Pour trouver un toit, il n’eut qu’à creuser un des tas de planches ; il en retira quelques morceaux de bois, qu’il rendit mobiles, de façon à pouvoir les déplacer et les replacer aisément. Dès lors, les amoureux eurent à leur disposition une sorte de guérite basse et étroite, un trou carré, où ils ne pouvaient tenir que serrés l’un contre l’autre, assis sur le bout d’un madrier, qu’ils laissaient au fond de la logette. Quand l’eau tombait, le premier arrivé se réfugiait là ; et, lorsqu’ils s’y trouvaient réunis, ils écoutaient avec une jouissance infinie l’averse qui battait sur le tas de planches de sourds roulements de tambour. Devant eux, autour d’eux, dans le noir d’encre de la nuit, il y avait un grand ruissellement qu’ils ne voyaient pas, et dont le bruit continu ressemblait à la voix haute d’une foule. Ils étaient bien seuls cependant, au bout du monde, au fond des eaux. Jamais ils ne se sentaient aussi heureux, aussi séparés des autres, qu’au milieu de ce déluge, dans ce tas de planches, menacés à chaque instant d’être emportés par les torrents du ciel. Leurs genoux repliés arrivaient presque au ras de l’ouverture, et ils s’enfonçaient le plus possible, les joues et les mains baignées d’une fine poussière de pluie. À leurs pieds, de grosses gouttes tombées des planches clapotaient à temps égaux. Et ils avaient chaud dans la pelisse brune ; ils étaient si à l’étroit, que Miette se trouvait à demi sur les genoux de Silvère. Ils bavardaient ; puis ils se taisaient, pris d’une langueur, assoupis par la tiédeur de leur embrassement et par le roulement monotone de l’averse. Pendant des heures, ils restaient là, avec cet amour de la pluie qui fait marcher gravement les petites filles, par les temps d’orage, une ombrelle ouverte à la main. Ils finirent par préférer les soirées pluvieuses. Seule, leur séparation devenait alors plus pénible. Il fallait que Miette franchît son mur sous la pluie battante, et qu’elle traversât les flaques du Jas-Meiffren en pleine obscurité. Dès qu’elle quittait ses bras, Silvère la perdait dans les ténèbres, dans la clameur de l’eau. Il écoutait vainement, assourdi, aveuglé. Mais l’inquiétude où les laissait tous deux cette brusque séparation était un charme de plus ; jusqu’au lendemain, ils se demandaient s’il ne leur était rien arrivé, par ce temps à ne pas mettre un chien dehors ; ils avaient peut-être glissé, ils pouvaient s’être égarés, craintes qui les occupaient tyranniquement l’un de l’autre, et qui rendaient plus tendre leur entrevue suivante.","Then came the rains, the snows, the frosts. These bad winter moods did not hold them back. Miette never came again without her big brown fur coat, and they both laughed at the bad times. When the night was dry and clear, when little breezes raised a white dust of jelly under their feet, and struck them in the face as if with slender sticks, they were careful not to sit down; they came and went more quickly, wrapped in the fur coat, their cheeks blue, their eyes weeping with cold; and they laughed, all shaken with gaiety by their rapid march in the icy air. One snowy evening, they amused themselves by making a huge ball which they rolled into a corner; she stayed there for a full month, which made them wonder at each new appointment. The rain did not frighten them either. They saw each other in terrible showers which wet them to the bone. Silvere came running up, telling himself that Miette would not be so mad as to come; and when Miette arrived in her turn, he no longer knew how to scold her. Deep down, he was waiting for her. He ended up looking for shelter from the bad weather, knowing that they would go out anyway, despite their mutual promise not to set foot outside when it rained. To find a roof, he had only to dig one of the piles of planks; he took out a few pieces of wood, which he made mobile, so as to be able to move and replace them easily. From then on, the lovers had at their disposal a kind of low and narrow sentry box, a square hole, where they could only hold tight against each other, seated on the end of a plank, which they left at the bottom of the cubicle. When the water fell, the first to arrive took refuge there; and, when they were there together, they listened with infinite delight to the downpour which beat over the heap of planks with dull drumbeats. In front of them, around them, in the inky blackness of the night, there was a great streaming which they could not see, and whose continuous noise sounded like the loud voice of a crowd. They were quite alone, however, at the end of the world, at the bottom of the waters. Never had they felt so happy, so separated from the others, as in the midst of this deluge, in this heap of planks, threatened at every moment with being swept away by the torrents of heaven. Their bent knees came almost flush with the opening, and they sank as low as possible, cheeks and hands bathed in a fine dust of rain. At their feet, large drops falling from the planks splashed at equal times. And they were warm in the brown fur coat; they were so cramped that Miette found herself half on Silvere's knees. They were chatting; then they were silent, seized with a languor, drowsy by the warmth of their embrace and by the monotonous rolling of the downpour. For hours they remained there, with that love of the rain which makes little girls walk solemnly in stormy weather, an open parasol in their hand. They ended up preferring rainy evenings. Only their separation then became more painful. Miette had to cross her wall in the pouring rain, and cross the puddles of the Jas-Meiffren in complete darkness. As soon as she left his arms, Silvere lost her in the darkness, in the clamor of the water. He listened in vain, deafened, blinded. But the uneasiness in which this abrupt separation left them both was one more charm; until the next day, they wondered if anything had happened to them, in this weather, not to put a dog outside; perhaps they had slipped, they might have gone astray, fears which tyrannically occupied them with each other, and which made their next interview more tender.","At last came rain, and snow, and frost. But the disagreeableness of winter did not keep them away. Miette put on her long brown pelisse, and they both made light of the bad weather. When the nights were dry and clear, and puffs of wind raised the hoar frost beneath their footsteps and fell on their faces like taps from a switch, they refrained from sitting down. They walked quickly to and fro, wrapped in the pelisse, their cheeks blue with cold, and their eyes watering; and they laughed heartily, quite quivering with mirth, at the rapidity of their march through the freezing atmosphere. One snowy evening they amused themselves with making an enormous snowball, which they rolled into a corner. It remained there fully a month, which caused them fresh astonishment each time they met in the path. Nor did the rain frighten them. They came to see each other through the heaviest downpours, though they got wet to the skin in doing so. Silvère would hasten to the spot, saying to himself that Miette would never be mad enough to come; and when Miette arrived, he could not find it in his heart to scold her. In reality he had been expecting her. At last he sought some shelter against the inclement weather, knowing quite well that they would certainly come out, however much they might promise one another not to do so when it rained. To find a shelter he only had to disturb one of the timber-stacks; pulling out several pieces of wood and arranging them so that they would move easily, in such wise that he could displace and replace them at pleasure. From that time forward the lovers possessed a sort of low and narrow sentry-box, a square hole, which was only big enough to hold them closely squeezed together on a beam which they had left at the bottom of the little cell. Whenever it rained, the first to arrive would take shelter here; and on finding themselves together again they would listen with delight to the rain beating on the piles of planks. Before and around them, through the inky blackness of the night, came a rush of water which they could not see, but which resounded continuously like the roar of a mob. They were nevertheless quite alone, as though they had been at the end of the world or beneath the sea. They never felt so happy, so isolated, as when they found themselves in that timber-stack, in the midst of some such deluge which threatened to carry them away at every moment. Their bent knees almost reached the opening, and though they thrust themselves back as far as possible, the spray of the rain bathed their cheeks and hands. The big drops, falling from the planks, splashed at regular intervals at their feet. The brown pelisse kept them warm, and the nook was so small that Miette was compelled to sit almost on Silvère’s knees. And they would chatter and then lapse into silence, overcome with languor, lulled by the warmth of their embrace and the monotonous beating of the shower. For hours and hours they remained there, with that same enjoyment of the rain which prompts little children to stroll along solemnly in stormy weather with open umbrellas in their hands. After a while they came to prefer the rainy evenings, though their parting became more painful on those occasions. Miette was obliged to climb the wall in the driving rain, and cross the puddles of the Jas-Meiffren in perfect darkness. As soon as she had left his arms, she was lost to Silvère amidst the gloom and the noise of the falling water. In vain he listened, he was deafened, blinded. However, the anxiety caused by this brusque separation proved an additional charm, and, until the morrow, each would be uneasy lest anything should have befallen the other in such weather, when one would not even have turned a dog out of doors. Perchance one of them had slipped, or lost the way; such were the mutual fears which possessed them, and rendered their next interview yet more loving.","At last rain, snow, and frost arrived. But the rigours of winter did not keep them away. Miette never came without her long brown pelisse, and they made light of the bad weather. When the nights were dry and clear, and puffs of wind raised the hoarfrost beneath their feet and fell on their faces like taps from a little twig, they did not sit down; they walked about more quickly, wrapped in the pelisse, their cheeks blue with cold and their eyes watering; and they laughed heartily, shaking with mirth, as they sped about in the freezing air. One snowy evening they amused themselves by making an enormous snowball, which they rolled into a corner; it remained there for a whole month, which astonished them afresh each time they came to the lane. Nor did the rain deter them. They came to see each other even in the heaviest downpours, even though they were drenched to the skin in the process. Silvère would hurry to their little hideaway, thinking to himself that Miette would never be mad enough to come; and when she arrived he could not find it in his heart to scold her. In reality he had been expecting her. At last he sought some shelter against the bad weather, knowing full well that they would venture out, however much they promised one another not to do so when it rained. To find a shelter he had only to rearrange one of the timber-stacks; he pulled out several planks and arranged them so that they could easily be put back into place. From that time onwards the sweethearts had at their disposal a sort of low, narrow sentry-box, a square hole which they could enter only if they squeezed together and sat on a beam they had left at the bottom of the little hut. Whenever it rained the first to arrive would take shelter there; and when they were together they would listen with delight to the rain beating on the piles of planks. In front of them, and all around, through the inky blackness of the night, there was a great downpour which they could not see but which resounded like the roar of an angry mob. However, they were totally alone, as if they were at the end of the world or the bottom of the sea. They never felt so happy, in their isolation, as when they were in that timber-stack, in the midst of a deluge that threatened to carry them away at any moment. Their bent knees almost protruded through the opening, and though they sat as far back as possible the spray of the rain bathed their cheeks and hands. The big drops, falling from the planks, splashed rhythmically at their feet. The brown pelisse kept them warm; and their hideaway was so small that Miette was almost obliged to sit on Silvère’s knees. They would chat and then lapse into silence, overcome with drowsiness, lulled by the warmth of their embrace and the monotonous beating of the rain. They would stay there for hours, with the same enjoyment of the rain that prompts little girls to stroll along solemnly in stormy weather with umbrellas. After a while they came to prefer the rainy evenings, though their parting became more painful on these occasions. Miette was obliged to climb the wall in the driving downpour and negotiate the puddles of the Jas-Meiffren in total darkness. As soon as she left his embrace she was lost to Silvère in the gloom and noise of the falling rain. He strained his ears, but was deafened and blinded. However, the anxiety caused by this sudden separation became an additional pleasure; until the next morning each would worry in case something had happened to the other in the filthy weather. One of them might have slipped or lost their way; such were their fears, which made their next meeting all the more loving."
"Rougon, seul enfin, s’assit à son tour dans le fauteuil du maire. Il poussa un soupir, il s’essuya le front. Que la conquête de la fortune et des honneurs était rude ! Enfin, il touchait au but, il sentait le fauteuil moelleux s’enfoncer sous lui, il caressait de la main, d’un geste machinal, le bureau d’acajou, qu’il trouvait soyeux et délicat comme la peau d’une jolie femme. Et il se carra davantage, il prit la pose digne que Macquart avait un instant auparavant, en écoutant la lecture de la proclamation. Autour de lui, le silence du cabinet lui semblait prendre une gravité religieuse qui lui pénétrait l’âme d’une divine volupté. Il n’était pas jusqu’à l’odeur de poussière et de vieux papiers, traînant dans les coins, qui ne montât comme un encens à ses narines dilatées. Cette pièce, aux tentures fanées, puant les affaires étroites, les soucis misérables d’une municipalité de troisième ordre, était un temple dont il devenait le dieu. Il entrait dans quelque chose de sacré. Lui qui, au fond, n’aimait pas les prêtres, il se rappela l’émotion délicieuse de sa première communion quand il avait cru avaler Jésus.","Rougon, alone at last, sat down in his turn in the mayor's chair. He sighed, wiping his brow. How harsh was the conquest of fortune and honors! Finally, he reached his goal, he felt the soft armchair sink under him, he caressed with his hand, with a mechanical gesture, the mahogany desk, which he found silky and delicate like the skin of a pretty woman. woman. And he straightened up more, he assumed the dignified pose that Macquart had had a moment before, listening to the reading of the proclamation. Around him, the silence of the closet seemed to him to take on a religious gravity which penetrated his soul with a divine voluptuousness. Even the smell of dust and old papers trailing in the corners rose like incense to his dilated nostrils. This room, with its faded hangings, reeking of narrow affairs, the miserable cares of a third-rate municipality, was a temple of which he became the god. He was entering into something sacred. He who, deep down, did not like priests, he remembered the delicious emotion of his first communion when he thought he had swallowed Jesus.","Rougon, who at last found himself alone, now in his turn sat down in the mayor’s arm-chair. He heaved a sigh as he wiped his brow. How hard, indeed, it was to win fortune and honours! However, he was nearing the end at last. He felt the soft seat of the arm-chair yield beneath him, while with a mechanical movement he caressed the mahogany writing-table with his hands, finding it apparently quite silky and delicate, like the skin of a beautiful woman. Then he spread himself out, and assumed the dignified attitude which Macquart had previously affected while listening to the proclamation. The silence of the room seemed fraught with religious solemnity, which inspired Rougon with exquisite delight. Everything, even the dust and the old documents lying in the corners, seemed to exhale an odour of incense, which rose to his dilated nostrils. This room, with its faded hangings redolent of petty transactions, all the trivial concerns of a third-rate municipality, became a temple of which he was the god. Nevertheless, amidst his rapture, he started nervously at every shout from Macquart.","Rougon, at last finding himself alone, sat down in his turn in the mayor’s armchair.

"L’homme s’assit pesamment. Quand il fut sur le trottoir, Macquart, levant les yeux, aperçut Félicité accoudée à une fenêtre du salon jaune et regardant curieusement le défilé des insurgés, comme s’il se fût agi d’un régiment traversant la ville, musique en tête.

"Gervaise, grande fille de vingt ans passés, rougissait d’être ainsi grondée devant Silvère. Celui-ci, en face d’elle, éprouvait un malaise. Un soir, étant venu tard, pendant une absence de son oncle, il avait trouvé la mère et la fille ivres mortes devant une bouteille vide. Depuis ce moment, il ne pouvait revoir sa cousine sans se rappeler le spectacle honteux de cette enfant, riant d’un rire épais, ayant de larges plaques rouges sur sa pauvre petite figure pâlie. Il était aussi intimidé par les vilaines histoires qui couraient sur son compte. Grandi dans une chasteté de cénobite, il la regardait parfois à la dérobée, avec l’étonnement craintif d’un collégien mis en face d’une fille.","Gervaise, a grown-up girl of twenty, blushed at being thus scolded in front of Silvere.

From that moment he could not see his cousin again without remembering the shameful sight of this child, laughing heartily, having large red patches on her poor little pale face. He was also intimidated by the ugly stories that were circulating about him.

From that time he could never see his cousin without recalling the disgraceful spectacle she had presented, with the maudlin grin and large red patches on her poor, pale, puny face. He was not less shocked by the nasty stories that circulated with regard to her. He sometimes looked at her stealthily, with the timid surprise of a schoolboy in the presence of a disreputable character.","Gervaise, now a young woman of more than twenty, coloured up at being scolded in this way in front of Silvère, who also felt uncomfortable.

"Rien de plus charmant, en vérité, que ces promenades d’amour. L’imagination câline et inventive du Midi est là tout entière. C’est une véritable mascarade, fertile en petits bonheurs et à la portée des misérables. L’amoureuse n’a qu’à ouvrir son vêtement, elle a un asile tout prêt pour son amoureux ; elle le cache sur son cœur, dans la tiédeur de ses habits, comme les petites bourgeoises cachent leurs galants sous les lits ou dans les armoires. Le fruit défendu prend ici une saveur particulièrement douce ; il se mange en plein air, au milieu des indifférents, le long des routes. Et ce qu’il y a d’exquis, ce qui donne une volupté pénétrante aux baisers échangés, ce doit être la certitude de pouvoir s’embrasser impunément devant le monde, de rester des soirées en public aux bras l’un de l’autre, sans courir le danger d’être reconnus et montrés au doigt. Un couple n’est plus qu’une masse brune, il ressemble à un autre couple. Pour le promeneur attardé, qui voit vaguement ces masses se mouvoir, c’est l’amour qui passe, rien de plus ; l’amour sans nom, l’amour qu’on devine et qu’on ignore. Les amants se savent bien cachés ; ils causent à voix basse, ils sont chez eux ; le plus souvent ils ne disent rien, ils marchent pendant des heures, au hasard, heureux de se sentir serrés ensemble dans le même bout d’indienne. Cela est très voluptueux et très virginal à la fois. Le climat est le grand coupable ; lui seul a dû d’abord inviter les amants à prendre les coins des faubourgs pour retraites. Par les belles nuits d’été, on ne peut faire le tour de Plassans sans découvrir, dans l’ombre de chaque pan de mur, un couple encapuchonné ; certains endroits, l’aire de Saint-Mittre par exemple, sont peuplés de ces dominos sombres qui se frôlent lentement, sans bruit, au milieu des tiédeurs de la nuit sereine ; on dirait les invités d’un bal mystérieux que les étoiles donneraient aux amours des pauvres gens. Quand il fait trop chaud et que les jeunes filles n’ont plus leur pelisse, elles se contentent de retrousser leur première jupe. L’hiver, les plus amoureux se moquent des gelées. Tandis qu’ils descendaient la route de Nice, Silvère et Miette ne songeaient guère à se plaindre de la froide nuit de décembre.","Nothing is more charming, in truth, than these walks of love. The cuddly and inventive imagination of the South is all there. It is a real masquerade, fertile in small pleasures and within the reach of the poor. The lover has only to open her garment, she has an asylum ready for her lover; she hides it over her heart, in the warmth of her clothes, as little bourgeoises hide their lovers under their beds or in their cupboards. The forbidden fruit takes on a particularly sweet flavor here; it is eaten in the open air, among the indifferent, along the roads. And what is exquisite, what gives a penetrating voluptuousness to the kisses exchanged, must be the certainty of being able to kiss each other with impunity in front of the world, of remaining evenings in public in the arms of one of the another, without running the risk of being recognized and singled out. A couple is no more than a brown mass, it looks like another couple. For the belated walker, who vaguely sees these masses moving, it is love that passes, nothing more; the nameless love, the love that we guess and do not know. The lovers know they are well hidden; they talk in low voices, they are at home; most often they say nothing, they walk for hours, haphazardly, happy to feel squeezed together in the same piece of calico. This is very voluptuous and very virginal at the same time. The climate is the big culprit; he alone must first have invited the lovers to take the corners of the suburbs for retreats. On beautiful summer nights, you cannot go around Plassans without discovering, in the shadow of each section of the wall, a hooded couple; certain places, the Saint-Mittre area for example, are populated by these dark dominoes which graze each other slowly, without noise, in the midst of the warmth of the serene night; one would say the guests of a mysterious ball that the stars would give to the loves of poor people. When it's too hot and the young girls don't have their coats on, they just roll up their first skirts. In winter, the most amorous don't care about the frosts. As they descended the road to Nice, Silvere and Miette scarcely thought of complaining of the cold December night.","And, on the other hand, nothing could be more charming than these lovers’ rambles, which appeal so keenly to the Southerner’s fanciful imagination. There is a veritable masquerade, fertile in innocent enjoyments, within the reach of the most humble. The girl clasps her sweetheart to her bosom, enveloping him in her own warm cloak; and no doubt it is delightful to be able to kiss one’s sweetheart within those shrouding folds without danger of being recognised. One couple is exactly like another. And to the belated pedestrian, who sees the vague groups gliding hither and thither, ‘tis merely love passing, love guessed and scarce espied. The lovers know they are safely concealed within their cloaks, they converse in undertones and make themselves quite at home; most frequently they do not converse at all, but walk along at random and in silence, content in their embrace. The climate alone is to blame for having in the first instance prompted these young lovers to retire to secluded spots in the suburbs. On fine summer nights one cannot walk round Plassans without coming across a hooded couple in every patch of shadow falling from the house walls. Certain places, the Aire Saint-Mittre, for instance, are full of these dark “dominoes” brushing past one another, gliding softly in the warm nocturnal air. One might imagine they were guests invited to some mysterious ball given by the stars to lowly lovers. When the weather is very warm and the girls do not wear cloaks, they simply turn up their over-skirts. And in the winter the more passionate lovers make light of the frosts. Thus, Miette and Silvère, as they descended the Nice road, thought little of the chill December night.","There is nothing more charming than these lovers’ walks. They embody the warm, fertile imagination of the people of the Midi. It is a veritable masquerade, full of innocent pleasure and available to the most humble. The girl has only to open her cloak and clasp her sweetheart to her in her ready-made hideaway; she conceals him in its warm folds, as bourgeois girls hide their suitors under their beds or in wardrobes. The forbidden fruit tastes particularly sweet like this; it is eaten in the open air, in the midst of other people, along the roads. And the delightful thing, that which gives their kisses a special intensity, is their security in the knowledge that they can embrace with impunity, that they can spend whole evenings arm-in-arm in public without the slightest risk of being recognized and pointed at. Each couple becomes a brown mass, exactly like another. To anyone out for a late stroll, and who sees these vague shapes moving along, it is simply the passage of love, anonymous love, felt but not seen. The couples know they are well hidden; they talk in undertones and feel at home in their little worlds; most often they walk for hours in silence, at random, content in their embrace within the same piece of calico. It is both voluptuous and virginal. The climate is to blame; it alone makes the young couples seek secluded spots on the edges of the town. On fine summer nights it is impossible to walk round Plassans without coming across a hooded couple in every patch of shadow cast by a wall. Some places, like the Aire Saint-Mittre, are full of these dark dominoes* gliding silently past each other in the warm night air; they are like guests invited to some mysterious ball given by the stars to the humble poor. When it is very hot and the girls do not wear their cloaks, they simply turn up their overskirts; and in the winter the more passionate couples are unconcerned by the frosts. Thus, as Miette and Silvère walked along the Nice road, they thought nothing of the chill December night."

"Derrière les gens de Faverolles, s’avançaient de petits groupes composés chacun de dix à vingt hommes au plus. Tous portaient la veste courte des paysans du Midi.

"Il en apprit de belles. D’après l’huissier, il avait les mains absolument liées. Sa mère seule pouvait aliéner l’enclos, ce dont il se doutait. Mais ce qu’il ignorait, ce qui fut pour lui un coup de massue, c’était qu’Ursule et Antoine, les bâtards, les louveteaux, eussent des droits sur cette propriété. Comment ! ces canailles allaient le dépouiller, le voler, lui, l’enfant légitime ! Les explications de l’huissier étaient claires et précises : Adélaïde avait, il est vrai, épousé Rougon sous le régime de la communauté ; mais toute la fortune consistant en biens-fonds, la jeune femme, selon la loi, était rentrée en possession de cette fortune, à la mort de son mari ; d’un autre côté, Macquart et Adélaïde avaient reconnu leurs enfants, qui dès lors devaient hériter de leur mère. Comme unique consolation, Pierre apprit que le Code rognait la part des bâtards au profit des enfants légitimes. Cela ne le consola nullement. Il voulait tout. Il n’aurait pas partagé dix sous entre Ursule et Antoine. Cette échappée sur les complications du Code lui ouvrit de nouveaux horizons, qu’il sonda d’un air singulièrement songeur. Il comprit vite qu’un homme habile doit toujours mettre la loi de son côté. Et voici ce qu’il trouva, sans consulter personne, pas même l’huissier, auquel il craignait de donner l’éveil. Il savait pouvoir disposer de sa mère comme d’une chose. Un matin, il la mena chez un notaire et lui fit signer un acte de vente. Pourvu qu’on lui laissât son taudis de l’impasse Saint-Mittre, Adélaïde aurait vendu Plassans. Pierre lui assurait, d’ailleurs, une rente annuelle de six cents francs, et lui jurait ses grands dieux qu’il veillerait sur son frère et sa sœur. Un tel serment suffisait à la bonne femme. Elle récita au notaire la leçon qu’il plut à son fils de lui souffler. Le lendemain, le jeune homme lui fit mettre son nom au bas d’un reçu, dans lequel elle reconnaissait avoir touché cinquante mille francs, comme prix de l’enclos. Ce fut là son coup de génie, un acte de fripon. Il se contenta de dire à sa mère, étonnée d’avoir à signer un pareil reçu, lorsqu’elle n’avait pas vu un centime des cinquante mille francs, que c’était une simple formalité ne tirant pas à conséquence. En glissant le papier dans sa poche, il pensait : « Maintenant, les louveteaux peuvent me demander des comptes. Je leur dirai que la vieille a tout mangé. Ils n’oseront jamais me faire un procès. » Huit jours après, le mur mitoyen n’existait plus, la charrue avait retourné la terre des plants de légumes ; l’enclos des Fouque, selon le désir du jeune Rougon, allait devenir un souvenir légendaire. Quelques mois plus tard, le propriétaire du Jas-Meiffren fit même démolir l’ancien logis des maraîchers, qui tombait en ruine.","He learned a lot. According to the bailiff, his hands were absolutely tied. Only his mother could alienate the paddock, which he suspected. But what he did not know, which was a crushing blow for him, was that Ursule and Antoine, the bastards, the cubs, had rights to this property. How ! those scoundrels were going to strip him, steal him, his legitimate child! The bailiff's explanations were clear and precise: Adélaïde had, it is true, married Rougon under the regime of the community; but all the fortune consisting of real estate, the young woman, according to the law, had come into possession of this fortune, at the death of her husband; on the other hand, Macquart and Adélaïde had recognized their children, who henceforth were to inherit from their mother. As a single consolation, Pierre learned that the Code reduced the part of the bastards to the profit of the legitimate children. This did not console him at all. He wanted it all. He would not have shared ten sous between Ursule and Antoine. This insight into the complications of the Code opened up new horizons for him, which he probed with a singularly thoughtful air. He quickly understood that a clever man must always put the law on his side. And here is what he found, without consulting anyone, not even the bailiff, whom he was afraid to alert. He knew he could dispose of his mother as a thing. One morning, he took her to a notary and made her sign a deed of sale. Provided that they left her hovel in the impasse Saint-Mittre, Adélaïde would have sold Plassans. Pierre assured him, moreover, of an annual allowance of six hundred francs, and swore to him by his great gods that he would watch over his brother and his sister. Such an oath was enough for the good woman. She recited to the notary the lesson which it pleased her son to whisper to her. The next day, the young man made her put his name at the bottom of a receipt, in which she acknowledged having received fifty thousand francs, as the price of the enclosure. This was his stroke of genius, an act of rascal. He contented himself with telling his mother, surprised at having to sign such a receipt, when she had not seen a penny of the fifty thousand francs, that it was a simple formality with no consequence. Slipping the paper into his pocket, he thought, “Now the Cubs can hold me to account. I'll tell them the old lady ate it all. They will never dare to sue me. Eight days later, the dividing wall no longer existed, the plow had turned over the soil from the vegetable plants; the enclosure of the Fouques, according to the desire of the young Rougon, was to become a legendary memory. A few months later, the owner of Jas-Meiffren even demolished the old market gardeners' house, which was falling into ruin.","He learnt some fine things from him. According to the lawyer, his hands were completely tied. His mother alone could alienate the property, and he doubted whether she would. But what he did not know, what came as a heavy blow to him, was that Ursule and Antoine, those young wolves, had claims on the estate. What! they would despoil him, rob him, the legitimate child! The lawyer’s explanations were clear and precise, however; Adélaïde, it is true, had married Rougon under the common property system; but as the whole fortune consisted of land, the young woman, according to law, again came into possession of everything at her husband’s death. Moreover, Macquart and Adélaïde had duly acknowledged their children when declaring their birth for registration, and thus these children were entitled to inherit from their mother. For sole consolation, Pierre learnt that the law reduced the share of illegitimate children in favour of the others. This, however, did not console him at all. He wanted to have everything. He would not have shared ten sous with Ursule and Antoine. This vista of the intricacies of the Code opened up a new horizon, which he scanned with a singularly thoughtful air. He soon recognised that a shrewd man must always keep the law on his side. And this is what he devised without consulting anyone, even the lawyer, whose suspicions he was afraid of arousing. He knew how to turn his mother round his finger. One fine morning he took her to a notary and made her sign a deed of sale. Provided she were left the hovel in the Impasse Saint-Mittre, Adélaïde would have sold all Plassans. Besides, Pierre assured her an annual income of six hundred francs, and made the most solemn promises to watch over his brother and sister. This oath satisfied the good woman. She recited, before the notary, the lesson which it had pleased her son to teach her. On the following day the young man made her place her name at the foot of a document in which she acknowledged having received fifty thousand francs as the price of the property. This was his stroke of genius, the act of a rogue. He contented himself with telling his mother, who was a little surprised at signing such a receipt when she had not seen a centime of the fifty thousand francs, that it was a pure formality of no consequence whatever. As he slipped the paper into his pocket, he thought to himself, “Now, let the young wolves ask me to render an account. I will tell them the old woman has squandered everything. They will never dare to go to law with me about it.” A week afterwards, the party-wall no longer existed: a plough had turned up the vegetable beds; the Fouques’ enclosure, in accordance with young Rougon’s wish, was about to become a thing of the past. A few months later, the owner of the Jas-Meiffren even had the old market-gardener’s house, which was falling to pieces, pulled down.","He learnt some remarkable things.

"D’ailleurs, ils avaient cessé toute conversation suivie ; ils ne parlaient plus des autres, ils ne parlaient même plus d’eux-mêmes ; ils étaient à la seule minute présente, échangeant un serrement de mains, poussant une exclamation à la vue d’un coin de paysage, prononçant de rares paroles, sans trop s’entendre, comme assoupis par la tiédeur de leurs corps.

"Pierre Rougon était un fils de paysan. La famille de sa mère, les Fouque, comme on les nommait, possédait, vers la fin du siècle dernier, un vaste terrain situé dans le faubourg, derrière l’ancien cimetière Saint-Mittre ; ce terrain a été plus tard réuni au Jas-Meiffren. Les Fouque étaient les plus riches maraîchers du pays ; ils fournissaient de légumes tout un quartier de Plassans. Le nom de cette famille s’éteignit quelques années avant la révolution. Une fille seule resta, Adélaïde, née en 1768, et qui se trouva orpheline à l’âge de dix-huit ans. Cette enfant, dont le père mourut fou, était une grande créature, mince, pâle, aux regards effarés, d’une singularité d’allures qu’on put prendre pour de la sauvagerie tant qu’elle resta petite fille. Mais, en grandissant, elle devint plus bizarre encore ; elle commit certaines actions que les plus fortes têtes du faubourg ne purent raisonnablement expliquer et, dès lors, le bruit courut qu’elle avait le cerveau fêlé comme son père. Elle se trouvait seule dans la vie, depuis six mois à peine, maîtresse d’un bien qui faisait d’elle une héritière recherchée, quand on apprit son mariage avec un garçon jardinier, un nommé Rougon, paysan mal dégrossi, venu des Basses-Alpes. Ce Rougon, après la mort du dernier des Fouque, qui l’avait loué pour une saison, était resté au service de la fille du défunt. De serviteur à gages, il passait brusquement au titre envié de mari. Ce mariage fut un premier étonnement pour l’opinion ; personne ne put comprendre pourquoi Adélaïde préférait ce pauvre diable, épais, lourd, commun, sachant à peine parler français, à tels et tels jeunes gens, fils de cultivateurs aisés, qu’on voyait rôder autour d’elle depuis longtemps. Et comme en province rien ne doit rester inexpliqué, on voulut voir un mystère quelconque au fond de cette affaire, on prétendit même que le mariage était devenu d’une absolue nécessité entre les jeunes gens. Mais les faits démentirent ces médisances. Adélaïde eut un fils au bout de douze grands mois. Le faubourg se fâcha ; il ne pouvait admettre qu’il se fût trompé, il entendait pénétrer le prétendu secret ; aussi toutes les commères se mirent-elles à espionner les Rougon. Elles ne tardèrent pas à avoir une ample matière à bavardages. Rougon mourut presque subitement, quinze mois après son mariage, d’un coup de soleil qu’il reçut, un après-midi, en sarclant un plant de carottes. Une année s’était à peine écoulée que la jeune veuve donna lieu à un scandale inouï ; on sut d’une façon certaine qu’elle avait un amant ; elle ne paraissait pas s’en cacher ; plusieurs personnes affirmaient l’avoir entendue tutoyer publiquement le successeur du pauvre Rougon. Un an de veuvage au plus, et un amant ! Un pareil oubli des convenances parut monstrueux, en dehors de la saine raison. Ce qui rendit le scandale plus éclatant, ce fut l’étrange choix d’Adélaïde. Alors demeurait au fond de l’impasse Saint-Mittre, dans une masure dont les derrières donnaient sur le terrain des Fouque, un homme mal famé, que l’on désignait d’habitude sous cette locution : « ce gueux de Macquart. » Cet homme disparaissait pendant des semaines entières ; puis on le voyait reparaître, un beau soir, les bras vides, les mains dans les poches, flânant ; il sifflait, il semblait revenir d’une petite promenade. Et les femmes, assises sur le seuil de leur porte, disaient en le voyant passer : « Tiens ! ce gueux de Macquart ! il aura caché ses ballots et son fusil dans quelque creux de la Viorne. » La vérité était que Macquart n’avait pas de rentes, et qu’il mangeait et buvait en heureux fainéant, pendant ses courts séjours à la ville. Il buvait surtout avec un entêtement farouche ; seul à une table, au fond d’un cabaret, il s’oubliait chaque soir, les yeux fixés stupidement sur son verre, sans jamais écouter ni regarder autour de lui. Et quand le marchand de vin fermait sa porte, il se retirait d’un pas ferme, la tête plus haute, comme redressé par l’ivresse. « Macquart marche bien droit, il est ivre mort », disait-on en le voyant rentrer. D’ordinaire, lorsqu’il n’avait pas bu, il allait légèrement courbé, évitant les regards des curieux, avec une sorte de timidité sauvage. Depuis la mort de son père, un ouvrier tanneur, qui lui avait laissé pour tout héritage la masure de l’impasse Saint-Mittre, on ne lui connaissait ni parents ni amis. La proximité des frontières et le voisinage des forêts de la Seille avaient fait de ce paresseux et singulier garçon un contrebandier doublé d’un braconnier, un de ces êtres à figure louche dont les passants disent : « Je ne voudrais pas rencontrer cette tête-là, à minuit, au coin d’un bois. » Grand, terriblement barbu, la face maigre, Macquart était la terreur des bonnes femmes du faubourg ; elles l’accusaient de manger des petits enfants tout crus. À peine âgé de trente ans, il paraissait en avoir cinquante. Sous les broussailles de sa barbe et les mèches de ses cheveux, qui lui couvraient le visage, pareilles aux touffes de poils d’un caniche, on ne distinguait que le luisant de ses yeux bruns, le regard furtif et triste d’un homme aux instincts vagabonds, que le vin et une vie de paria ont rendu mauvais. Bien qu’on ne pût préciser aucun de ses crimes, il ne se commettait pas un vol, pas un assassinat dans le pays, sans que le premier soupçon se portât sur lui. Et c’était cet ogre, ce brigand, ce gueux de Macquart qu’Adélaïde avait choisi ! En vingt mois, elle eut deux enfants, un garçon, puis une fille. De mariage entre eux, il n’en fut pas un instant question. Jamais le faubourg n’avait vu une pareille audace dans l’inconduite. La stupéfaction fut si grande, l’idée que Macquart avait pu trouver une maîtresse jeune et riche renversa à un tel point les croyances des commères, qu’elles furent presque douces pour Adélaïde. « La pauvre ! elle est devenue complètement folle, disaient-elles ; si elle avait une famille, il y a longtemps qu’elle serait enfermée. » Et, comme on ignora toujours l’histoire de ces amours étranges, ce fut encore cette canaille de Macquart qui fut accusé d’avoir abusé du cerveau faible d’Adélaïde pour lui voler son argent.","Pierre Rougon was a peasant's son. His mother's family, the Fouques, as they were called, owned, towards the end of the last century, a vast piece of land located in the suburb, behind the old Saint-Mittre cemetery; this land was later reunited with Jas-Meiffren. The Fouques were the richest market gardeners in the country; they supplied a whole district of Plassans with vegetables. The name of this family died out a few years before the revolution. Only one girl remained, Adélaïde, born in 1768, and who was orphaned at the age of eighteen. This child, whose father died mad, was a tall creature, slender, pale, with startled looks, with a singular bearing that could be taken for savagery as long as she remained a little girl. But, as she grew older, she became more bizarre still; she committed certain actions which the strongest heads of the faubourg could not reasonably explain, and from then on it was rumored that she was crack-brained like her father. She had been alone in life for barely six months, mistress of a property which made her a sought-after heiress, when they learned of her marriage to a young gardener, a man named Rougon, a rough-hewn peasant from the Basses- Alps. This Rougon, after the death of the last of the Fouques, who had hired him for a season, had remained in the service of the daughter of the deceased. From hired servant, he suddenly passed to the envied title of husband. This marriage was a first astonishment for public opinion; no one could understand why Adélaïde preferred this poor devil, thick, heavy, common, barely able to speak French, to such and such young people, sons of well-to-do farmers, who had been seen prowling around her for a long time. And as in the provinces nothing should remain unexplained, they wanted to see some mystery at the bottom of this affair, they even claimed that marriage had become an absolute necessity between young people. But the facts belied these gossip. Adelaide had a son after twelve full months. The faubourg grew angry; he could not admit that he had been mistaken, he intended to penetrate the pretended secret; so all the gossips began to spy on the Rougons. They soon had plenty to talk about. Rougon died almost suddenly, fifteen months after his marriage, from a sunburn he received one afternoon while weeding a carrot plant. A year had hardly passed when the young widow gave rise to an unprecedented scandal; it was known for certain that she had a lover; she did not seem to hide it; several people claimed to have heard her publicly address poor Rougon's successor as familiar terms. A year of widowhood at most, and a lover! Such a neglect of propriety seemed monstrous outside of sound reason. What made the scandal more glaring was the strange choice of Adelaide. Then there lived at the end of the impasse Saint-Mittre, in a hovel whose backs gave onto the Fouque land, a man of disrepute, who was usually referred to by this phrase: ""that beggar Macquart."" This man disappeared for whole weeks; then we saw him reappear, one fine evening, his arms empty, his hands in his pockets, strolling; he was whistling, he seemed to be coming back from a short walk. And the women, seated on their doorsteps, said when they saw him pass: “Look! that beggar Macquart! he will have hidden his bales and his rifle in some hollow of the Viorne. The truth was that Macquart had no income, and that he ate and drank like a happy idler during his short stays in town. He drank mostly with fierce stubbornness; Alone at a table, in the back of a cabaret, he forgot himself each evening, his eyes fixed stupidly on his glass, without ever listening or looking around him. And when the wine merchant closed his door, he withdrew with a firm step, his head held high, as if straightened by intoxication. ""Macquart walks very straight, he's dead drunk,"" they said when they saw him return. Usually, when he had not drunk, he walked slightly bent over, avoiding the gaze of onlookers, with a sort of savage timidity. Since the death of his father, a tanner, who had left him as his only inheritance the hovel of the impasse Saint-Mittre, neither relatives nor friends were known to him. The proximity of the borders and the vicinity of the forests of the Seille had made this lazy and singular boy a smuggler coupled with a poacher, one of those creatures with a suspicious face whose passers-by say: ""I would not like to meet that face , at midnight, at the corner of a wood. Tall, terribly bearded, thin-faced, Macquart was the terror of the good women of the faubourg; they accused him of eating little children raw. Barely thirty years old, he looked fifty. Beneath the brushwood of his beard and the locks of his hair, which covered his face, like tufts of hair on a poodle, one could only make out the gleam of his brown eyes, the furtive and sad gaze of a man with wandering instincts, which wine and an outcast life have made evil. Although none of his crimes could be specified, there was never a robbery or an assassination in the country without the first suspicion falling on him. And it was this ogre, this brigand, this beggar Macquart that Adelaide had chosen! In twenty months, she had two children, a boy, then a girl. Of marriage between them, there was no question of it for a moment. Never had the faubourg seen such audacity in misconduct. The amazement was so great, the idea that Macquart had been able to find a young and rich mistress so overturned the beliefs of the gossips, that they were almost sweet for Adelaide. "" The poor ! she has gone completely mad, they said; if she had a family, she would have been locked up a long time ago. And, as the history of these strange loves has always been ignored, it was again that scoundrel Macquart who was accused of having abused Adelaide's weak brain to steal her money.","Pierre Rougon was the son of a peasant. His mother’s family, the Fouques, owned, towards the end of the last century, a large plot of ground in the Faubourg, behind the old cemetery of Saint-Mittre; this ground was subsequently joined to the Jas-Meiffren. The Fouques were the richest market-gardeners in that part of the country; they supplied an entire district of Plassans with vegetables. However, their name died out a few years before the Revolution. Only one girl, Adélaïde, remained; born in 1768, she had become an orphan at the age of eighteen. This girl, whose father had died insane, was a long, lank, pale creature, with a scared look and strange ways which one might have taken for shyness so long as she was a little girl. As she grew up, however, she became still stranger; she did certain things which were inexplicable even to the cleverest folk of the Faubourg, and from that time it was rumoured that she was cracked like her father. She had scarcely been an orphan six months, in possession of a fortune which rendered her an eagerly sought heiress, when it transpired that she had married a young gardener named Rougon, a rough-hewn peasant from the Basses-Alpes. This Rougon, after the death of the last of the male Fouques, who had engaged him for a term, had remained in the service of the deceased’s daughter. From the situation of salaried servant he ascended rapidly to the enviable position of husband. This marriage was a first shock to public opinion. No one could comprehend why Adélaïde preferred this poor fellow, coarse, heavy, vulgar, scarce able to speak French, to those other young men, sons of well-to-do farmers, who had been seen hovering round her for some time. And, as provincial people do not allow anything to remain unexplained, they made sure there was some mystery at the bottom of this affair, alleging even that the marriage of the two young people had become an absolute necessity. But events proved the falsity of the accusation. More than a year went by before Adélaïde had a son. The Faubourg was annoyed; it could not admit that it was wrong, and determined to penetrate the supposed mystery; accordingly all the gossips kept a watch upon the Rougons. They soon found ample matter for tittle-tattle. Rougon died almost suddenly, fifteen months after his marriage, from a sunstroke received one afternoon while he was weeding a bed of carrots. Scarcely a year then elapsed before the young widow caused unheard-of scandal. It became known, as an indisputable fact, that she had a lover. She did not appear to make any secret of it; several persons asserted that they had heard her use endearing terms in public to poor Rougon’s successor. Scarcely a year of widowhood and a lover already! Such a disregard of propriety seemed monstrous out of all reason. And the scandal was heightened by Adélaïde’s strange choice. At that time there dwelt at the end of the Impasse Saint-Mittre, in a hovel the back of which abutted on the Fouques’ land, a man of bad repute, who was generally referred to as “that scoundrel Macquart.” This man would vanish for weeks and then turn up some fine evening, sauntering about with his hands in his pockets and whistling as though he had just come from a short walk. And the women sitting at their doorsteps as he passed: “There’s that scoundrel Macquart! He has hidden his bales and his gun in some hollow of the Viorne.” The truth was, Macquart had no means, and yet ate and drank like a happy drone during his short sojourns in the town. He drank copiously and with fierce obstinacy. Seating himself alone at a table in some tavern, he would linger there evening after evening, with his eyes stupidly fixed on his glass, neither seeing nor hearing anything around him. When the landlord closed his establishment, he would retire with a firm step, with his head raised, as if he were kept yet more erect by inebriation. “Macquart walks so straight, he’s surely dead drunk,” people used to say, as they saw him going home. Usually, when he had had no drink, he walked with a slight stoop and shunned the gaze of curious people with a kind of savage shyness. Since the death of his father, a journeyman tanner who had left him as sole heritage the hovel in the Impasse Saint-Mittre, he had never been known to have either relatives or friends. The proximity of the frontiers and the neighbouring forests of the Seille had turned this singular, lazy fellow into a combination of smuggler and poacher, one of those suspicious-looking characters of whom passers-by observe: “I shouldn’t care to meet that man at midnight in a dark wood.” Tall, with a formidable beard and lean face, Macquart was the terror of the good women of the Faubourg of Plassans; they actually accused him of devouring little children raw. Though he was hardly thirty years old, he looked fifty. Amidst his bushy beard and the locks of hair which hung over his face in poodle fashion, one could only distinguish the gleam of his brown eyes, the furtive sorrowful glance of a man of vagrant instincts, rendered vicious by wine and a pariah life. Although no crimes had actually been brought home to him, no theft or murder was ever perpetrated in the district without suspicion at once falling upon him. And it was this ogre, this brigand, this scoundrel Macquart, whom Adélaïde had chosen! In twenty months she had two children by him, first a boy and then a girl. There was no question of marriage between them. Never had the Faubourg beheld such audacious impropriety. The stupefaction was so great, the idea of Macquart having found a young and wealthy mistress so completely upset the gossips, that they even spoke gently of Adélaïde. “Poor thing! She’s gone quite mad,” they would say. “If she had any relatives she would have been placed in confinement long ago.” And as they never knew anything of the history of those strange amours, they accused that rogue Macquart of having taken advantage of Adélaïde’s weak mind to rob her of her money.","Pierre Rougon was the son of a peasant.

He was barely thirty but looked fifty. Between his bushy beard and the locks of hair that hung down over his face in poodle fashion, you could only make out the gleam of his brown eyes, the furtive, melancholic look of a man of tramp-like instincts, gone to the bad because of wine and the life of an outcast.

"Cet air grave et mélancolique qu’il respira dès son enfance donna à Silvère une âme forte, où s’amassèrent tous les enthousiasmes. Ce fut de bonne heure un petit homme sérieux, réfléchi, qui rechercha l’instruction avec une sorte d’entêtement. Il n’apprit qu’un peu d’orthographe et d’arithmétique à l’école des frères, que les nécessités de son apprentissage lui firent quitter à douze ans. Les premiers éléments lui manquèrent toujours. Mais il lut tous les volumes dépareillés qui lui tombèrent sous la main, et se composa ainsi un étrange bagage ; il avait des données sur une foule de choses, données incomplètes, mal digérées, qu’il ne réussit jamais à classer nettement dans sa tête. Tout petit, il était allé jouer chez un maître charron, un brave homme nommé Vian, dont l’atelier se trouvait au commencement de l’impasse, en face de l’aire Saint-Mittre, où le charron déposait son bois. Il montait sur les roues des carrioles en réparation, il s’amusait à traîner les lourds outils que ses petites mains pouvaient à peine soulever ; une de ses grandes joies était alors d’aider les ouvriers, en maintenant quelque pièce de bois ou en leur apportant les ferrures dont ils avaient besoin. Quand il eut grandi, il entra naturellement en apprentissage chez Vian, qui s’était pris d’amitié pour ce galopin qu’il rencontrait sans cesse dans ses jambes, et qui le demanda à Adélaïde sans vouloir accepter la moindre pension. Silvère accepta avec empressement, voyant déjà le moment où il rendrait à la pauvre tante Dide ce qu’elle avait dépensé pour lui. En peu de temps, il devint un excellent ouvrier. Mais il se sentait des ambitions plus hautes. Ayant aperçu, chez un carrossier de Plassans, une belle calèche neuve, toute luisante de vernis, il s’était dit qu’il construirait un jour des voitures semblables. Cette calèche resta dans son esprit comme un objet d’art rare et unique, comme un idéal vers lequel tendirent ses aspirations d’ouvrier. Les carrioles auxquelles il travaillait chez Vian, ces carrioles qu’il avait soignées amoureusement, lui semblaient maintenant indignes de ses tendresses. Il se mit à fréquenter l’école de dessin, où il se lia avec un jeune échappé du collège qui lui prêta son ancien traité de géométrie. Et il s’enfonça dans l’étude, sans guide, passant des semaines à se creuser la tête pour comprendre les choses les plus simples du monde. Il devint ainsi un de ces ouvriers savants qui savent à peine signer leur nom et qui parlent de l’algèbre comme d’une personne de leur connaissance. Rien ne détraque autant un esprit qu’une pareille instruction, faite à bâtons rompus, ne reposant sur aucune base solide. Le plus souvent, ces miettes de science donnent une idée absolument fausse des hautes vérités, et rendent les pauvres d’esprit insupportables de carrure bête. Chez Silvère, les bribes de savoir volé ne firent qu’accroître les exaltations généreuses. Il eut conscience des horizons qui lui restaient fermés. Il se fit une idée sainte de ces choses qu’il n’arrivait pas à toucher de la main, et il vécut dans une profonde et innocente religion des grandes pensées et des grands mots vers lesquels il se haussait, sans toujours les comprendre. Ce fut un naïf, un naïf sublime, resté sur le seuil du temple, à genoux devant des cierges qu’il prenait de loin pour des étoiles.","This grave and melancholy air which he breathed from his childhood gave Silvere a strong soul, in which all enthusiasm amassed. Early on he was a serious, thoughtful little man who sought instruction with a kind of stubbornness. He learned only a little spelling and arithmetic at the school of the brothers, which the necessities of his apprenticeship caused him to leave at the age of twelve. The first elements always failed him. But he read all the mismatched volumes that came to hand, and thus composed a strange baggage; he had data on a host of things, incomplete, badly digested data, which he never succeeded in classifying neatly in his head. As a child, he had gone to play with a master wheelwright, a brave man named Vian, whose workshop was at the beginning of the cul-de-sac, opposite the Saint-Mittre area, where the wheelwright left his wood. He rode on the wheels of carts being repaired, he amused himself dragging the heavy tools that his small hands could barely lift; one of his great joys was then to help the workmen, by maintaining some piece of wood or by bringing them the fittings they needed. When he grew up, he naturally entered an apprenticeship with Vian, who had taken a liking to this rascal whom he constantly met in his lap, and who asked Adelaide without wanting to accept the slightest pension. Silvère eagerly accepted, already seeing the moment when he would return to poor Aunt Dide what she had spent on him. In a short time, he became an excellent worker. But he felt loftier ambitions. Having seen, at a coachbuilder in Plassans, a beautiful new carriage, all gleaming with varnish, he told himself that one day he would build similar cars. This carriage remained in his mind as a rare and unique work of art, as an ideal towards which his aspirations as a worker tended. The carts on which he worked at Vian's, those carts which he had lovingly cared for, now seemed to him unworthy of his love. He began to attend drawing school, where he became friends with a young college dropout who lent him his old treatise on geometry. And he plunged into study, without a guide, spending weeks racking his brains to understand the simplest things in the world. He thus became one of those learned workmen who hardly know how to sign their name and who speak of algebra as of a person of their acquaintance. Nothing upsets a mind so much as such instruction, done randomly, resting on no solid foundation. More often than not, these crumbs of science give an absolutely false idea of the high truths, and make the poor in spirit intolerable of stupid build. With Silvere, the snatches of stolen knowledge only increased the generous exaltations. He was aware of the horizons that remained closed to him. He formed a holy idea of those things which he could not touch with his hand, and he lived in a profound and innocent religion of the great thoughts and great words to which he raised himself, without always understanding them. He was a naïve, a sublime naïve, remaining on the threshold of the temple, kneeling before candles which he took from afar for stars.","The sad, solemn atmosphere, which he had breathed from childhood, gave Silvère a strong heart, in which gathered every form of enthusiasm. He early became a serious, thoughtful little man, seeking instruction with a kind of stubbornness. He only learnt a little spelling and arithmetic at the school of the Christian Brothers, which he was compelled to leave when he was but twelve years old, on account of his apprenticeship. He never acquired the first rudiments of knowledge. However, he read all the odd volumes which fell into his hands, and thus provided himself with strange equipment; he had some notions of a multitude of subjects, ill-digested notions, which he could never classify distinctly in his head. When he was quite young, he had been in the habit of playing in the workshop of a master wheelwright, a worthy man named Vian, who lived at the entrance of the blind-alley in front of the Aire Saint-Mittre where he stored his timber. Silvère used to jump up on the wheels of the tilted carts undergoing repair, and amuse himself by dragging about the heavy tools which his tiny hands could scarcely lift. One of his greatest pleasures, too, was to assist the workmen by holding some piece of wood for them, or bringing them the iron-work which they required. When he had grown older he naturally became apprenticed to Vian. The latter had taken a liking to the little fellow who was always kicking about his heels, and asked Adélaïde to let him come, refusing to take anything for his board and lodging. Silvère eagerly accepted, already foreseeing the time when he would be able to make his poor aunt Dide some return for all she had spent upon him. In a short time he became an excellent workman. He cherished, however, much higher ambitions. Having once seen, at a coachbuilder’s at Plassans, a fine new carriage, shining with varnish, he vowed that he would one day build carriages himself. He remembered this carriage as a rare and unique work of art, an ideal towards which his aspirations should tend. The tilted carts at which he worked in Vian’s shop, those carts which he had lovingly cherished, now seemed unworthy of his affections. He began to attend the local drawing-school, where he formed a connection with a youngster who had left college, and who lent him an old treatise on geometry. He plunged into this study without a guide, racking his brains for weeks together in order to grasp the simplest problem in the world. In this matter he gradually became one of those learned workmen who can hardly sign their name and yet talk about algebra as though it were an intimate friend. Nothing unsettles the mind so much as this desultory kind of education, which reposes on no firm basis. Most frequently such scraps of knowledge convey an absolutely false idea of the highest truths, and render persons of limited intellect insufferably stupid. In Silvère’s case, however, his scraps of stolen knowledge only augmented his liberal aspirations. He was conscious of horizons which at present remained closed to him. He formed for himself divine conceptions of things beyond his reach, and lived on, regarding in a deep, innocent, religious way the noble thoughts and grand conceptions towards which he was raising himself, but which he could not as yet comprehend. He was one of the simple-minded, one whose simplicity was divine, and who had remained on the threshold of the temple, kneeling before the tapers which from a distance he took for stars.","The sad, solemn atmosphere in which he had lived since childhood gave Silvère a strong, passionate character. He soon became a serious, thoughtful little fellow, intent on seeking instruction. He only learnt a small amount of spelling and arithmetic at the Catholic school, which he had to leave when he was just twelve on account of his apprenticeship. He never acquired the basic rudiments of an education. However, he read all the books he could find, and thus provided himself with a strange stock of knowledge; he had certain notions about a host of subjects, but these notions were ill-digested, and he could never order them clearly in his head. When he was quite young he had been in the habit of playing in the workshop of a master wheel-wright, a decent man named Vian, whose place was situated at the top of the lane opposite the Aire Saint-Mittre, where he stored his timber. Silvère used to jump up on the wheels of the carts tilted sideways for repair, and enjoyed dragging about the heavy tools he could scarcely lift with his little hands; one of his greatest pleasures was to help the workmen by holding a piece of wood for them, or bringing them the ironwork they needed. When he was older he naturally became apprenticed to Vian; the wheelwright had taken a liking to the lad, whom he found constantly by his side, and asked Adélaïde if he could join him, without taking anything for his board and lodging. Silvère eagerly accepted, already anticipating the time when he would be able to give something back to his poor Aunt Dide for all she had spent on him. He soon became an excellent worker. However, he had greater ambitions. Having once seen, at a coachbuilder’s in Plassans, a fine new carriage shining with fresh varnish, he vowed that one day he would build similar carriages himself. He remembered this carriage as a rare and unique work of art, an ideal towards which his ambitions as a worker were now directed. The tilted carts at which he worked in Vian’s workshop, the carts he had tended so lovingly, now seemed unworthy of his affection. He began to attend the local draughtsman-ship school, where he became friends with a youngster who had left school early, and who lent him an old geometry textbook. He immersed himself in this without any guidance, racking his brains for weeks at a stretch to grasp the simplest problems. He thus became one of those semi-educated workers who can barely sign their name and yet talk about algebra as if intimately acquainted with it. Nothing unsettles the mind more than this desultory kind of education, lacking any firm basis. More often than not the acquired scraps of knowledge convey an absolutely false idea of the highest truths, and render persons of limited intellect insufferably stupid. In Silvère’s case, these scraps of knowledge fanned the flames of his liberal sentiments. He became aware of worlds which hitherto had remained closed to him. He formed divine conceptions of things beyond his reach, regarding in a deep, innocent, religious way the noble thoughts and grand ideas to which he aspired but which he could not yet comprehend. He was one of the simple-minded, one whose simplicity was sublime, and who had remained on the threshold of the temple, kneeling before the candles which from a distance he took for stars."
"Le soir, dès qu’il fut rentré de l’atelier, il courut grimper sur le mur. Il trouva Miette à sa besogne de la veille. Il l’appela. Elle vint à lui, avec son sourire embarrassé, son adorable sauvagerie d’enfant grandie dans les larmes.","In the evening, as soon as he returned from the studio, he ran to climb the wall. He found Miette at her task the night before. He called her. She came to him, with her embarrassed smile, her adorable childish savagery grown in tears.","In the evening, as soon as he had returned home from the workshop, he ran to the wall and climbed upon it.

"À quatre heures, Rougon, suivi de Granoux, se rendit à l’hôtel Valqueyras. De petites bandes, qui rejoignaient les insurgés, à Orchères, passaient toujours au loin, dans la vallée de la Viorne. Toute la journée, des gamins avaient grimpé sur les remparts, des bourgeois étaient venus regarder par les meurtrières. Ces sentinelles volontaires entretenaient l’épouvante de la ville, en comptant tout haut les bandes, qui étaient prises pour autant de forts bataillons. Ce peuple poltron croyait assister, des créneaux, aux préparatifs de quelque massacre universel.

These voluntary sentries kept the city in awe, counting out loud the bands, which were taken for so many strong battalions. This cowardly people thought they were watching, from the battlements, the preparations for some universal massacre. At dusk, like the day before, panic blew in, colder.","At four o’clock Rougon, followed by Granoux, again repaired to the Valqueyras mansion. Small bands, on their way to join the insurgents at Orcheres, still passed along in the distance, through the valley of the Viorne. Throughout the day urchins climbed the ramparts, and bourgeois came to peep through the loopholes. These volunteer sentinels kept up the terror by counting the various bands, which were taken for so many strong battalions. The timorous population fancied it could see from the battlements the preparations for some universal massacre. At dusk, as on the previous evening, the panic became yet more chilling.","At four o’clock Rougon, followed by Granoux, went back to the Valqueyras mansion.

"Au bout d’un silence, elle vint, sans dire un mot, prendre le jeune homme par la main. Peut-être les eût-elle laissés là, à jaser au pied du mur, si elle ne s’était sentie complice de ces douceurs mortelles. Comme elle rentrait avec Silvère, elle se retourna, en entendant le pas léger de Miette qui s’était hâtée de reprendre sa cruche et de fuir à travers le chaume. Elle courait follement, heureuse d’en être quitte à si bon marché. Tante Dide eut un sourire involontaire, à la voir traverser le champ comme une chèvre échappée.","After a silence, she came, without saying a word, to take the young man by the hand. Perhaps she would have left them there, chatting against the wall, if she had not felt an accomplice to these mortal sweetnesses. As she was returning with Silvere, she turned round, hearing the light step of Miette, who had hastened to take up her pitcher and flee through the stubble. She ran madly, happy to get off so cheaply. Aunt Dide smiled involuntarily, seeing her cross the field like an escaped goat.","After a brief pause, she went up to the young man, and, without a word, took him by the hand.

She was running wildly, glad at having escaped so easily.

"Enfin, comme Pierre impatienté parlait de les jeter tous les deux à la porte, Antoine abaissa ses prétentions et, d’un coup, ne réclama plus que mille francs.

"Jamais Vuillet n’avait été plus heureux. Depuis qu’il pouvait glisser ses doigts minces dans le courrier, il goûtait des voluptés profondes, des voluptés de prêtre curieux, s’apprêtant à savourer les aveux de ses pénitentes. Toutes les indiscrétions sournoises, tous les bavardages vagues des sacristies chantaient à ses oreilles. Il approchait son long nez blême des lettres, il regardait amoureusement les suscriptions de ses yeux louches, il auscultait les enveloppes, comme les petits abbés fouillent l’âme des vierges. C’étaient des jouissances infinies, des tentations pleines de chatouillements. Les mille secrets de Plassans étaient là ; il touchait à l’honneur des femmes, à la fortune des hommes, et il n’avait qu’à briser les cachets, pour en savoir aussi long que le grand vicaire de la cathédrale, le confident des personnes comme il faut de la ville. Vuillet était une de ces terribles commères, froides, aiguës, qui savent tout, se font tout dire, et ne répètent les bruits que pour en assassiner les gens. Aussi avait-il fait souvent le rêve d’enfoncer son bras jusqu’à l’épaule dans la boîte aux lettres. Pour lui, depuis la veille, le cabinet du directeur des postes était un grand confessionnal plein d’une ombre et d’un mystère religieux, dans lequel il se pâmait en humant les murmures voilés, les aveux frissonnants qui s’exhalaient des correspondances. D’ailleurs, le libraire faisait sa petite besogne avec une impudence parfaite. La crise que traversait le pays lui assurait l’impunité. Si les lettres éprouvaient quelque retard, si d’autres s’égaraient même complètement, ce serait la faute de ces gueux de républicains, qui couraient la campagne et interrompaient les communications. La fermeture des portes l’avait un instant contrarié ; mais il s’était entendu avec Roudier pour que les courriers pussent entrer et lui fussent apportés directement, sans passer par la mairie.","Never had Vuillet been happier. Ever since he could slip his slender fingers through the mail, he had tasted deep pleasures, the pleasures of a curious priest, getting ready to savor the confessions of his penitents. All the sly indiscretions, all the vague chatter of the sacristies sang in his ears. He approached the letters with his long pale nose, he gazed lovingly at the superscriptions with his squint eyes, he auscultated the envelopes, as the little abbés search the souls of virgins. They were infinite pleasures, temptations full of tickling. The thousand secrets of Plassans were there; he touched on the honor of women, on the fortune of men, and he had only to break the seals to know as much about it as the grand vicar of the cathedral, the confidant of the city's respectable people. . Vuillet was one of those terrible gossips, cold, shrill, who know everything, are told everything, and repeat rumors only to assassinate people. So he had often dreamed of sticking his arm up to his shoulder in the mailbox. For him, since the day before, the cabinet of the postmaster had been a great confessional full of shadow and religious mystery, in which he swooned, inhaling the veiled murmurs, the shuddering confessions which were exhaled from the correspondence. Besides, the bookseller was doing his little job with perfect impudence. The crisis that the country was going through ensured impunity. If the letters experienced any delay, if others even lost their way completely, it would be the fault of those Republican rascals, who roamed the countryside and interrupted communications. The closing of the doors had annoyed him for a moment; but he had come to an understanding with Roudier that the couriers could enter and be brought to him directly, without going through the town hall.","Never in his life had Vuillet felt so happy.

He poked his long, pale nose into the letters, gazed amorously at the superscriptions with his suspicious eyes, sounded the envelopes just like little abbés sound the souls of maidens.

He held in his hand the honour of women, the fortunes of men, and had only to break a seal to know as much as the grand vicar at the cathedral who was the confidant of all the better people of the town. Vuillet was one of those terribly bitter, frigid gossips, who worm out everything, but never repeat what they hear, except by way of dealing somebody a mortal blow. He had, consequently, often longed to dip his arms into the public letter-box. Since the previous evening the private room at the post-office had become a big confessional full of darkness and mystery, in which he tasted exquisite rapture while sniffing at the letters which exhaled veiled longings and quivering avowals. Moreover, he carried on his work with consummate impudence. The crisis through which the country was passing secured him perfect impunity. If some letters should be delayed, or others should miscarry altogether, it would be the fault of those villainous Republicans who were scouring the country and interrupting all communication. The closing of the town gates had for a moment vexed him, but he had come to an understanding with Roudier, whereby the couriers were allowed to enter and bring the mails direct to him without passing by the town-hall.","Never had Vuillet felt so happy.

"Il se jeta à terre, il se vautra aux pieds du gendarme, suppliant, s’imaginant sans doute qu’on le prenait pour un autre.","He threw himself on the ground, he wallowed at the feet of the policeman, pleading, doubtless imagining that he was taken for another.","Then he threw himself on the ground, rolling at the gendarme’s feet, breaking out into prayers for mercy, and imagining that he was being mistaken for some one else.","Then he threw himself on the ground, sprawling at the gendarme’s feet begging for mercy, imagining that he had been mistaken for someone else."

"C’était un superbe article, d’une violence inouïe contre les insurgés. Jamais tant de fiel, tant de mensonges, tant d’ordures dévotes n’avaient coulé d’une plume. Vuillet commençait par faire le récit de l’entrée de la bande dans Plassans. Un pur chef-d’œuvre. On y voyait « ces bandits, ces faces patibulaires, cette écume des bagnes », envahissant la ville, « ivres d’eau-de-vie, de luxure et de pillage » ; puis il les montrait « étalant leur cynisme dans les rues, épouvantant la population par des cris sauvages, ne cherchant que le viol et l’assassinat ». Plus loin, la scène de l’hôtel de ville et l’arrestation des autorités devenaient tout un drame atroce : « Alors, ils ont pris à la gorge les hommes les plus respectables ; et, comme Jésus, le maire, le brave commandant de la garde nationale, le directeur des postes, ce fonctionnaire si bienveillant, ont été couronnés d’épines par ces misérables, et ont reçu leurs crachats au visage. » L’alinéa consacré à Miette et à sa pelisse rouge montait en plein lyrisme. Vuillet avait vu dix, vingt filles sanglantes : « Et qui n’a pas aperçu, au milieu de ces monstres, des créatures infâmes vêtues de rouge, et qui devaient s’être roulées dans le sang des martyrs que ces brigands ont assassinés le long des routes ? Elles brandissaient des drapeaux, elles s’abandonnaient, en pleins carrefours, aux caresses ignobles de la horde tout entière. » Et Vuillet ajoutait avec une emphase biblique : « La République ne marche jamais qu’entre la prostitution et le meurtre. » Ce n’était là que la première partie de l’article ; le récit terminé, dans une péroraison virulente, le libraire demandait si le pays souffrirait plus longtemps « la honte de ces bêtes fauves qui ne respectaient ni les propriétés ni les personnes » ; il faisait un appel à tous les valeureux citoyens en disant qu’une plus longue tolérance serait un encouragement, et qu’alors les insurgés viendraient prendre « la fille dans les bras de la mère, l’épouse dans les bras de l’époux » ; enfin, après une phrase dévote dans laquelle il déclarait que Dieu voulait l’extermination des méchants, il terminait par ce coup de trompette : « On affirme que ces misérables sont de nouveau à nos portes ; eh bien ! que chacun de nous prenne un fusil et qu’on les tue comme des chiens ; on me verra au premier rang, heureux de débarrasser la terre d’une pareille vermine. »","It was a superb article, of incredible violence against the insurgents. Never had so much gall, so many lies, so much devout filth flowed from a feather. Vuillet began by recounting the gang's entry into Plassans. A pure masterpiece. We saw there “those bandits, those sinister faces, that scum of the prisons”, invading the city, “drunk with brandy, lust and pillage”; then he showed them “flaunting their cynicism in the streets, terrifying the population with savage cries, seeking only rape and assassination”. Later, the scene of the town hall and the arrest of the authorities became a whole atrocious drama: “So they took the most respectable men by the throat; and, like Jesus, the mayor, the brave commander of the National Guard, the postmaster, that benevolent functionary, were crowned with thorns by these wretches, and received their spit in the face. The paragraph devoted to Miette and her red fur coat rose in full lyricism. Vuillet had seen ten, twenty bloody girls: ""And who has not seen, in the midst of these monsters, infamous creatures dressed in red, and who must have rolled themselves in the blood of the martyrs whom these brigands murdered along roads ? They brandished flags, they abandoned themselves, in the crossroads, to the ignoble caresses of the entire horde. And Vuillet added with biblical emphasis: “The Republic never walks except between prostitution and murder. This was only the first part of the article; the story over, in a virulent peroration, the bookseller asked if the country would suffer any longer ""the shame of these wild beasts who respected neither property nor people""; he appealed to all brave citizens, saying that a longer tolerance would be an encouragement, and that then the insurgents would come and take ""the daughter in the arms of the mother, the wife in the arms of the husband"" ; finally, after a devout phrase in which he declared that God wanted the extermination of the wicked, he ended with this trumpet blast: “It is affirmed that these wretches are again at our gates; well ! let each of us take a gun and kill them like dogs; I will be seen in the front row, happy to rid the earth of such vermin. »","It was a magnificent article, attacking the insurgents with unheard of violence. Never had so much stinging bitterness, so many falsehoods, such bigoted abuse flowed from pen before. Vuillet commenced by narrating the entry of the insurgents into Plassans. The description was a perfect masterpiece. He spoke of “those bandits, those villainous-looking countenances, that scum of the galleys,” invading the town, “intoxicated with brandy, lust, and pillage.” Then he exhibited them “parading their cynicism in the streets, terrifying the inhabitants with their savage cries and seeking only violence and murder.” Further on, the scene at the town-hall and the arrest of the authorities became a most horrible drama. “Then they seized the most respectable people by the throat; and the mayor, the brave commander of the national guard, the postmaster, that kindly functionary, were—even like the Divinity—crowned with thorns by those wretches, who spat in their faces.” The passage devoted to Miette and her red pelisse was quite a flight of imagination. Vuillet had seen ten, twenty girls steeped in blood: “and who,” he wrote, “did not behold among those monsters some infamous creatures clothed in red, who must have bathed themselves in the blood of the martyrs murdered by the brigands along the high roads? They were brandishing banners, and openly receiving the vile caresses of the entire horde.” And Vuillet added, with Biblical magniloquence, “The Republic ever marches on amidst debauchery and murder.” That, however, was only the first part of the article; the narrative being ended, the editor asked if the country would any longer tolerate “the shamelessness of those wild beasts, who respected neither property nor persons.” He made an appeal to all valorous citizens, declaring that to tolerate such things any longer would be to encourage them, and that the insurgents would then come and snatch “the daughter from her mother’s arms, the wife from her husband’s embraces.” And at last, after a pious sentence in which he declared that Heaven willed the extermination of the wicked, he concluded with this trumpet blast: “It is asserted that these wretches are once more at our gates; well then let each one of us take a gun and shoot them down like dogs. I for my part shall be seen in the front rank, happy to rid the earth of such vermin.”","It was a magnificent article, attacking the insurgents with tremendous venom. Never before had so much bile, so many falsehoods, such violent abuse flowed from a journalist’s pen. Vuillet began by describing the entry of the insurgents into Plassans. It was an absolute masterpiece. He described ‘those bandits, those sinister faces, that scum from the galleys’ invading the town, ‘drunk on brandy, lust, and the urge to pillage’; then he described them ‘parading their cynicism in the streets, terrifying the townspeople with their savage cries, bent on rape and murder’. Later in the article the scene at the town hall and the arrest of the authorities became a most horrible drama. ‘Then they seized the most respectable men by the throat; and the mayor, the brave commander of the National Guard, the postmaster, that kindly functionary, were — like Jesus himself — crowned with thorns by the wretches, who spat in their faces.’ The paragraph devoted to Miette and her red pelisse was especially fanciful. Vuillet had seen ten, twenty girls smeared with blood: ‘and who’, he wrote, ‘did not behold among those monsters some unspeakable creatures dressed in red, who must have rolled in the blood of the martyrs murdered by the bandits along the roads? They were brandishing banners and openly offering themselves to the entire horde.’ Vuillet added, with biblical grandiloquence: ‘The Republic never marches without debauchery and murder by her side.’ That, however, was only the first part of the article; after the narrative itself the bookseller asked if the country would continue to tolerate ‘the shamelessness of these wild beasts, who respect neither property nor persons’; he appealed to all brave citizens, declaring that to tolerate such things any longer would be tantamount to encouraging them, and that the insurgents would then come and snatch ‘the daughter from her mother’s arms, the wife from her husband’s embrace’, and finally, after a pious sentence in which he declared that it was God’s will that the wicked be exterminated, he concluded with this trumpet-blast: ‘It is said that these wretches are once more at our gates; well, let each one of us take a gun and shoot them down like dogs; I, for my part, will be in the vanguard, happy to rid the earth of such vermin.’"
"« Tu seras bien avancé, quand tu m’auras cassé une jambe ou un bras, lui disait-elle. Qui te nourrira, fainéant ? »","“You will be well advanced when you have broken my leg or my arm,” she told him. Who will feed you, lazy? »","“You’ll be in a fine plight when you’ve broken one of my arms or legs,” she would say to him. “Who’ll keep you then, you lazy fellow?”","‘That won’t get you very far, if you break one of my arms or legs,’ she would say. ‘Who’ll keep you then, you lazy bugger?’"
"« C’est cela, allez toujours… balbutiait-il. Ce soir ou demain, quand les autres reviendront, nous réglerons nos comptes ! »","""That's it, always go..."" he stammered. Tonight or tomorrow, when the others come back, we'll settle our accounts! »","“All right; go on,” he muttered. “This evening or to-morrow, when the others return, we’ll settle accounts!”","‘That’s it, go on...’, he muttered. ‘ This evening or tomorrow, when the others come back, we’ll sort things out!’"
"Un matin, elle se fâcha pour tout de bon. Elle ne trouva pas Silvère au rendez-vous, et elle l’attendit près d’un quart d’heure, en faisant vainement grincer la poulie. Elle allait s’éloigner, exaspérée, lorsqu’il arriva enfin. Dès qu’elle l’aperçut, elle déchaîna une véritable tempête dans le puits ; elle agitait le seau d’une main irritée, l’eau noirâtre tourbillonnait avec des jaillissements sourds contre les pierres. Silvère eut beau lui expliquer que tante Dide l’avait retenu. À toutes les excuses, elle répondait :","One morning, she got really angry. She did not find Silvere at the rendezvous, and she waited for him nearly a quarter of an hour, making the pulley creak in vain. She was about to walk away, exasperated, when he finally arrived. As soon as she saw him, she unleashed a veritable storm in the well; she shook the bucket with an irritated hand, the blackish water swirled with dull spurts against the stones. Silvère tried in vain to explain to him that Aunt Dide had kept him. To all the excuses, she replied:","One morning she got angry in real earnest. She did not find Silvère at the trysting-place, and waited for him for nearly a quarter of an hour, vainly making the pulley grate. She was just about to depart in a rage when he arrived.

"Quand Pierre eut les cinquante mille francs entre les mains, il épousa Félicité Puech, dans les délais strictement nécessaires. Félicité était une petite femme noire, comme on en voit en Provence. On eût dit une de ces cigales brunes, sèches, stridentes, aux vols brusques, qui se cognent la tête dans les amandiers. Maigre, la gorge plate, les épaules pointues, le visage en museau de fouine, singulièrement fouillé et accentué, elle n’avait pas d’âge ; on lui eût donné quinze ans ou trente ans, bien qu’elle en eût en réalité dix-neuf, quatre de moins que son mari. Il y avait une ruse de chatte au fond de ses yeux noirs, étroits, pareils à des trous de vrille. Son front bas et bombé ; son nez légèrement déprimé à la racine, et dont les narines s’évasaient ensuite, fines et frémissantes, comme pour mieux goûter les odeurs ; la mince ligne rouge de ses lèvres, la proéminence de son menton qui se rattachait aux joues par des creux étranges ; toute cette physionomie de naine futée était comme le masque vivant de l’intrigue, de l’ambition active et envieuse. Avec sa laideur, Félicité avait une grâce à elle, qui la rendait séduisante. On disait d’elle qu’elle était jolie ou laide à volonté. Cela devait dépendre de la façon dont elle nouait ses cheveux, qui étaient superbes ; mais cela dépendait plus encore du sourire triomphant qui illuminait son teint doré, lorsqu’elle croyait l’emporter sur quelqu’un. Née avec une sorte de mauvaise chance, se jugeant mal partagée par la fortune, elle consentait le plus souvent à n’être qu’un laideron. D’ailleurs, elle n’abandonnait pas la lutte, elle s’était promis de faire un jour crever d’envie la ville entière par l’étalage d’un bonheur et d’un luxe insolents. Et si elle avait pu jouer sa vie sur une scène plus vaste, où son esprit délié se fût développé à l’aise, elle aurait à coup sûr réalisé promptement son rêve. Elle était d’une intelligence fort supérieure à celle des filles de sa classe et de son instruction. Les méchantes langues prétendaient que sa mère, morte quelques années après sa naissance, avait, dans les premiers temps de son mariage, été intimement liée avec le marquis de Carnavant, un jeune noble du quartier Saint-Marc. La vérité était que Félicité avait des pieds et des mains de marquise, et qui semblaient ne pas devoir appartenir à la race de travailleurs dont elle descendait.","When Pierre had the fifty thousand francs in his hands, he married Félicité Puech, within the time strictly necessary. Félicité was a short black woman, such as one sees in Provence. It looked like one of those brown cicadas, dry, shrill, with sudden flights, banging their heads in the almond trees. Thin, with a flat throat, pointed shoulders, a weasel-like face, singularly detailed and accentuated, she was ageless; she would have been thought to be fifteen or thirty, although she was in reality nineteen, four younger than her husband. There was a cat's cunning in the depths of his narrow, dark, gimlet-hole eyes. His low, domed forehead; his nose slightly depressed at the root, and whose nostrils then widened, fine and quivering, as if to better taste the odors; the thin red line of his lips, the prominence of his chin which was attached to the cheeks by strange hollows; all that shrewd dwarf countenance was like the living mask of intrigue, of active and envious ambition. With her ugliness, Felicite had a grace of her own that made her attractive. It was said of her that she was pretty or ugly at will. It must have depended on how she tied her hair, which was beautiful; but that depended still more on the triumphant smile which lit up her golden complexion when she thought she had the upper hand. Born with a kind of bad luck, judging herself badly shared by fortune, she generally consented to be nothing but an ugly person. Besides, she was not giving up the fight, she had promised herself that one day she would make the whole town burst with envy by the display of insolent happiness and luxury. And if she had been able to play her life on a larger stage, where her free spirit had developed at ease, she would certainly have quickly realized her dream. She was of an intelligence far superior to that of the girls of her class and of her education. Evil gossip claimed that his mother, who died a few years after his birth, had, in the early days of her marriage, been intimately connected with the Marquis de Carnavant, a young nobleman of the Saint-Marc quarter. The truth was that Felicite had the feet and hands of a marquise, which seemed not to belong to the race of workers from which she descended.","When Pierre had secured the fifty thousand francs he married Félicité Puech with as little delay as possible. Félicité was a short, dark woman, such as one often meets in Provence. She looked like one of those brown, lean, noisy grasshoppers, which in their sudden leaps often strike their heads against the almond-trees. Thin, flat-breasted, with pointed shoulders and a face like that of a pole-cat, her features singularly sunken and attenuated, it was not easy to tell her age; she looked as near fifteen as thirty, although she was in reality only nineteen, four years younger than her husband. There was much feline slyness in the depths of her little black eyes, which suggested gimlet holes. Her low, bumpy forehead, her slightly depressed nose with delicate quivering nostrils, her thin red lips and prominent chin, parted from her cheeks by strange hollows, all suggested the countenance of an artful dwarf, a living mask of intrigue, an active, envious ambition. With all her ugliness, however, Félicité possessed a sort of gracefulness which rendered her seductive. People said of her that she could be pretty or ugly as she pleased. It would depend on the fashion in which she tied her magnificent hair; but it depended still more on the triumphant smile which illumined her golden complexion when she thought she had got the better of somebody. Born under an evil star, and believing herself ill-used by fortune, she was generally content to appear an ugly creature. She did not, however, intend to abandon the struggle, for she had vowed that she would some day make the whole town burst with envy, by an insolent display of happiness and luxury. Had she been able to act her part on a more spacious stage, where full play would have been allowed her ready wit, she would have quickly brought her dream to pass. Her intelligence was far superior to that of the girls of her own station and education. Evil tongues asserted that her mother, who had died a few years after she was born, had, during the early period of her married life, been familiar with the Marquis de Carnavant, a young nobleman of the Saint-Marc quarter. In fact, Félicité had the hands and feet of a marchioness, and, in this respect, did not appear to belong to that class of workers from which she was descended.","When Pierre had secured the fifty thousand francs, he married Félicité Puesch with as little delay as possible. Félicité was a short, dark, typically Provençal woman. She looked like one of those thin, brown, noisy cicadas that, when they suddenly jump up, often knock their heads against the almond trees. Skinny, flat-chested, with pointed shoulders and a face like a weasel, her features strong and oddly sunken, she was of indeterminate age; she looked as near fifteen as thirty, though she was in fact only nineteen, four years younger than her husband. There was a feline shyness in her black, gimlet-like eyes. Her whole physiognomy — her low, protuberant forehead, her slightly depressed nose with delicate, flared nostrils, her thin red lips and prominent chin, parted from her cheeks by strange hollows — was that of a kind of crafty dwarf, a living mask of intrigue, envy, and ambition. Despite her ugliness, however, Félicité had a distinctive kind of gracefulness that made her quite seductive. People said of her that she could be as pretty or ugly as she pleased. It depended on how she tied her magnificent hair; but it depended even more on the triumphant smile that lit up her tanned face when she thought how she had got the better of somebody. Born under an evil star, and believing herself to be unlucky, she was generally content to appear ugly. She did not, however, intend to abandon the struggle, for she had vowed that one day she would make the whole town burst with envy by an insolent display of happiness and luxury. Had she been able to act her part on a larger stage, where her ready wit would have been allowed full play, she would quickly have realized her dream. She was far more intelligent than the girls of her own station and education. Malicious gossips claimed that her mother, who had died a few years after she was born, had, during the early part of her married life, been on intimate terms with the Marquis de Carnavant, a young nobleman from the Saint-Marc quarter. It was true that Félicité had the hands and feet of a marchioness, and in that sense did not seem to belong to the line of workers from which she was descended."
"Puis, comme son mari ne disait rien, elle alla machinalement à la fenêtre, à cette fenêtre où elle avait humé avec délice l’encens de toute une sous-préfecture. Elle aperçut des groupes nombreux en bas, sur la place ; elle ferma les persiennes, voyant des têtes se tourner vers leur maison, et craignant d’être huée. On parlait d’eux ; elle en eut le pressentiment.","Then, as her husband said nothing, she went mechanically to the window, to that window where she had sniffed with delight the incense of an entire sub-prefecture. She saw large groups downstairs in the square; she closed the shutters, seeing heads turn towards their house, and fearing to be booed. We were talking about them; she had a presentiment of it.","Then, as her husband said nothing, she mechanically went to the window—that window where she had inhaled with delight the incense of the entire town. She perceived numerous groups below on the square, but she closed the blinds upon seeing some heads turn towards their house, for she feared that she might be hooted. She felt quite sure that those people were speaking about them.","Then, as her husband remained silent, she went mechanically to the window — the window where she had breathed in with delight the sweet smell of an entire sub-prefecture. She saw a number of large groups of people on the square; and she closed the shutters on noticing heads turn towards their house, for she was afraid they might be jeered at. She was sure the people down below were talking about them."
"« Peut-être qu’on l’a emmené avec les autres… », dit-il pour se tranquilliser.",“Maybe we took him with the others…” he said to calm himself down.,"“Perhaps they’ve taken him away with the others,” he said, to ease his mind.","‘Perhaps they’ve taken him away with the others... ,’ he said, to ease his mind."
"Félicité referma la porte. Aristide, dans son trou noir, venait d’avoir un éblouissement. Sans attendre que le marquis eût gagné la rue, il dégringola quatre à quatre l’escalier et s’élança dehors comme un fou ; puis il prit sa course vers l’imprimerie de l’Indépendant. Un flot de pensées battait dans sa tête. Il enrageait, il accusait sa famille de l’avoir dupé. Comment ! Eugène tenait ses parents au courant de la situation, et jamais sa mère ne lui avait fait lire les lettres de son frère aîné, dont il aurait suivi aveuglément les conseils ! Et c’était à cette heure qu’il apprenait par hasard que ce frère aîné regardait le succès du coup d’État comme certain ! Cela, d’ailleurs, confirmait en lui certains pressentiments que cet imbécile de sous-préfet lui avait empêché d’écouter. Il était surtout exaspéré contre son père, qu’il avait cru assez sot pour être légitimiste, et qui se révélait bonapartiste au bon moment.","Felicite closed the door. Aristide, in his black hole, had just had a dazzle. Without waiting for the marquis to reach the street, he tumbled down the stairs four at a time and dashed out like a madman; then he set off for the printing office of the Independent. A flood of thoughts pounded in his head. He was furious, he accused his family of having tricked him. How ! Eugene kept his parents informed of the situation, and his mother had never made him read the letters from his older brother, whose advice he would have blindly followed! And it was at this hour that he learned by chance that this elder brother regarded the success of the coup d'etat as certain! This, moreover, confirmed in him certain presentiments that this stupid sub-prefect had prevented him from listening to. Above all, he was exasperated with his father, whom he had thought foolish enough to be a Legitimist, and who was proving to be a Bonapartist at the right time.","Félicité closed the door again. Aristide had received quite a shock in his dark corner. However, without waiting for the marquis to reach the street, he bounded down the staircase, four steps at a time, rushed outside like a madman, and turned his steps towards the printing-office of the “Indépendant.” A flood of thoughts surged through his mind. He was enraged, and accused his family of having duped him. What! Eugène kept his parents informed of the situation, and yet his mother had never given him any of his eldest brother’s letters to read, in order that he might follow the advice given therein! And it was only now he learnt by chance that his eldest brother regarded the success of the Coup d’État as certain!

"– Mais tu n’arriveras à rien, interrompit vivement Félicité. On te grugera. Vois tes frères, ils cherchent à faire leur chemin. »","“But you won’t get anywhere,” interrupted Félicité quickly. We'll cheat you. See your brothers, they are trying to make their way. »","“But you will never attain to any position,” Félicité quickly interrupted. “You will be crushed. Look at your brothers, they are trying to make their way.”","‘But you’ll never get anywhere in life like that,’ Félicité interrupted. ‘You’ll just be walked over. Look at your brothers, they’re trying to get on.’"
"– Ah ! quel grand innocent ! criait l’oncle. Quand nous serons les plus forts, tu verras si je ne fais pas mes petites affaires moi-même. Le bon Dieu s’occupe bien de nous !

VII,VII,CHAPTER VII,CHAPTER 7
"Cependant Félicité avait fait un signe à son mari. Pierre, très entouré, questionné affectueusement sur sa pâleur, ne réussit qu’à s’échapper une minute. Il put murmurer à l’oreille de sa femme qu’il avait retrouvé Pascal et que Macquart partait dans la nuit. Il baissa encore la voix pour lui apprendre la folie de sa mère, en mettant un doigt sur sa bouche, comme pour dire : « Pas un mot, ça gâterait notre soirée. » Félicité pinça les lèvres. Ils échangèrent un regard où ils lurent leur commune pensée : maintenant, la vieille ne les gênerait plus ; on raserait la masure du braconnier, comme on avait rasé les murs de l’enclos des Fouque, et ils auraient à jamais le respect et la considération de Plassans.","However, Felicite had made a sign to her husband. Pierre, very surrounded, affectionately questioned about his pallor, only managed to escape for a minute. He was able to whisper in his wife's ear that he had found Pascal and that Macquart was leaving during the night. He lowered his voice again to tell her of his mother's folly, putting a finger to his mouth, as if to say: ""Not a word, it would spoil our evening."" Felicite pursed her lips. They exchanged a look in which they read their common thought: now the old woman would no longer bother them; the poacher's hovel would be demolished, as the walls of the Fouques' enclosure had been demolished, and they would forever have the respect and consideration of Plassans.","In the meantime, Félicité had made a sign to her husband. Pierre, surrounded by everybody and anxiously questioned about his pallor, could only escape for a minute. He was just able to whisper in his wife’s ear that he had found Pascal and that Macquart would leave that night. Then lowering his voice still more he told her of his mother’s insanity, and placed his finger on his lips, as if to say: “Not a word; that would spoil the whole evening.” Félicité bit her lips. They exchanged a look in which they read their common thoughts: so now the old woman would not trouble them any more: the poacher’s hovel would be razed to the ground, as the walls of the Fouques’ enclosure had been demolished; and they would for ever enjoy the respect and esteem of Plassans.","In the meantime Félicité had beckoned to her husband.

Then, lowering his voice even more, he told her of his mother’s insanity, and raised a finger to his lips as if to say: ‘Not a word; it would spoil the whole evening.’ Félicité bit her lip. They exchanged a look in which each read the same thoughts: the old woman would trouble them no longer, they would raze the poacher’s shack to the ground just as they had demolished the walls of the Fouques’ property, and they would enjoy forever more the respect and esteem of the people of Plassans."
"« Il me semble que je suis à la procession de la Fête-Dieu, et que je porte la bannière de la Vierge. »","“It seems to me that I am in the Corpus Christi procession, and that I am carrying the banner of the Virgin. »","Miette bent towards him, and with her childish smile observed: “I feel as if I were at the procession on Corpus Christi Day carrying the banner of the Virgin.”","‘I feel as if I’m in the Corpus Christi procession, carrying the banner of the Virgin.’"
"Le contrebandier venait très irrégulièrement, presque toujours à l’improviste. Jamais on ne sut au juste quelle était la vie des amants, pendant les deux ou trois jours qu’il passait à la ville, de loin en loin. Ils s’enfermaient, le petit logis paraissait inhabité. Le faubourg ayant décidé que Macquart avait séduit Adélaïde uniquement pour lui manger son argent, on s’étonna, à la longue, de voir cet homme vivre comme par le passé, sans cesse par monts et par vaux, aussi mal équipé qu’auparavant. Peut-être la jeune femme l’aimait-elle d’autant plus qu’elle le voyait à de plus longs intervalles ; peut-être avait-il résisté à ses supplications, éprouvant l’impérieux besoin d’une existence aventureuse. On inventa mille fables, sans pouvoir expliquer raisonnablement une liaison qui s’était nouée et se prolongeait en dehors de tous les faits ordinaires. Le logis de l’impasse Saint-Mittre resta hermétiquement clos et garda ses secrets. On devina seulement que Macquart devait battre Adélaïde, bien que jamais le bruit d’une querelle ne sortît de la maison. À plusieurs reprises, elle reparut, la face meurtrie, les cheveux arrachés. D’ailleurs, pas le moindre accablement de souffrance ni même de tristesse, pas le moindre souci de cacher ses meurtrissures. Elle souriait, elle semblait heureuse. Sans doute, elle se laissait assommer sans souffler mot. Pendant plus de quinze ans, cette existence dura.","The smuggler came very irregularly, almost always unexpectedly. No one ever knew exactly what the life of the lovers was like during the two or three days that he spent in town, from time to time. They locked themselves in, the little house seemed uninhabited. The faubourg having decided that Macquart had seduced Adélaïde solely to devour her money, people were surprised, in the long run, to see this man living as in the past, constantly up and down hill, as badly equipped as before. Perhaps the young woman loved him the more because she saw him at longer intervals; perhaps he had resisted her pleas, craving an adventurous existence. A thousand fables were invented, without being able to reasonably explain a bond that had been formed and continued beyond all ordinary facts. The house in the impasse Saint-Mittre remained hermetically sealed and kept its secrets. It was only guessed that Macquart was to beat Adelaide, although never the sound of a quarrel left the house. Several times she reappeared, her face bruised, her hair torn out. Besides, not the slightest overwhelm of suffering or even sadness, not the slightest concern to hide his bruises. She was smiling, she seemed happy. No doubt she allowed herself to be knocked out without saying a word. For more than fifteen years, this existence lasted.","The smuggler would come very irregularly, almost always unexpectedly, to Plassans. Nobody ever knew what life the lovers led during the two or three days he spent there at distant intervals. They used to shut themselves up; the little dwelling seemed uninhabited. Then, as the gossips had declared that Macquart had simply seduced Adélaïde in order to spend her money, they were astonished, after a time, to see him still lead his wonted life, ever up hill and down dale and as badly equipped as previously. Perhaps the young woman loved him all the more for seeing him at rare intervals, perhaps he had disregarded her entreaties, feeling an irresistible desire for a life of adventure. The gossips invented a thousand fables, without succeeding in giving any reasonable explanation of a connection which had originated and continued in so strange a manner. The hovel in the Impasse Saint-Mittre remained closed and preserved its secrets. It was merely guessed that Macquart had probably acquired the habit of beating Adélaïde, although the sound of a quarrel never issued from the house. However, on several occasions she was seen with her face black and blue, and her hair torn away. At the same time, she did not display the least dejection or grief, nor did she seek in any way to hide her bruises. She smiled, and seemed happy.

"Tous se penchèrent sur le parapet, retenant leur souffle. Et, légers, avec des puretés de cristal, les tintements éloignés d’une cloche montèrent de la plaine. Ces messieurs ne purent nier. C’était bien le tocsin. Rougon prétendit reconnaître la cloche du Béage, un village situé à une grande lieue de Plassans. Il disait cela pour rassurer ses collègues.","Everyone leaned over the parapet, holding their breath. And, light, with the purity of crystal, the distant tinkling of a bell rose from the plain.

He said this to reassure his colleagues.","At this they all leant over the parapet, holding their breath. And light and pure as crystal the distant tolling of a bell rose from the plain.

"Quand il fut en haut, il aperçut, dans un rayon de lune qui entrait par la dentelure d’une ogive, Granoux, sans chapeau, l’air furieux, tapant devant lui avec un gros marteau. Et qu’il y allait de bon cœur ! Il se renversait, prenait un élan, et tombait sur le bronze sonore, comme s’il eût voulu le fendre. Toute sa personne grasse se ramassait ; puis quand il s’était jeté sur la grosse cloche immobile, les vibrations le renvoyaient en arrière, et il revenait avec un nouvel emportement. On aurait dit un forgeron battant un fer chaud ; mais un forgeron en redingote, court et chauve, d’attitude maladroite et rageuse.","When he was at the top, he perceived, in a ray of moonlight which entered through the indentations of an arch, Granoux, without a hat, looking furious, banging in front of him with a big hammer. And that he went there with a good heart! He threw himself back, took a dash, and fell on the sonorous bronze, as if he wanted to split it. His whole fat person was hunched over; then when he had thrown himself on the big motionless bell, the vibrations sent him back, and he came back with a new passion. He looked like a blacksmith beating a hot iron; but a blacksmith in a frock coat, short and bald, with an awkward and angry demeanor.","When he had reached the top he caught sight of Granoux, by the light of the moon which glided through an embrasure; the ex almond dealer was standing there hatless, and dealing furious blows with a heavy hammer. He did so with a right good will. He first threw himself back, then took a spring, and finally fell upon the sonorous bronze as if he wanted to crack it. One might have thought he was a blacksmith striking hot iron—but a frock-coated blacksmith, short and bald, working in a wild and awkward way.","When he reached the top he caught sight of Granoux, standing in the moonlight that shone in through an arch; the former almond-dealer, hatless, was dealing furious blows with a heavy hammer. He put his heart into each blow. He leaned back, threw himself forward, and fell upon the sonorous bronze as if he wanted to crack it. His whole portly frame was concentrated on the task; each time the vibration sent him reeling backwards, and each time he returned with renewed determination. You might have thought he was a blacksmith striking hot iron — but a frock-coated blacksmith, short, bald, clumsy, and half-demented."
"« Alors, bêta, demanda-t-elle, comment se fait-il que tu ne te sois pas rallié plus tôt ?","""So, silly,"" she asked, ""how come you didn't rally sooner?""","She began to smile again, and asked more softly: “Well, then, you blockhead, how is it you didn’t rally to us sooner?”","‘Well, then, you silly thing, how is it you didn’t come over to our side sooner?’"
"Macquart dut vite renoncer à entraîner dans sa campagne contre les Rougon ce gros garçon laborieux, qu’il traitait d’avare et de sournois, par une rancune de fainéant. Mais il crut découvrir le complice qu’il cherchait dans le second fils Mouret, Silvère, un enfant âgé de quinze ans. Lorsqu’on trouva Mouret pendu dans les jupes de sa femme, le petit Silvère n’allait pas même encore à l’école. Son frère aîné, ne sachant que faire de ce pauvre être, l’emmena avec lui chez son oncle. Celui-ci fit la grimace en voyant arriver l’enfant ; il n’entendait pas pousser ses compensations jusqu’à nourrir une bouche inutile. Silvère, que Félicité prit également en grippe, grandissait dans les larmes, comme un malheureux abandonné, lorsque sa grand-mère, dans une des rares visites qu’elle faisait aux Rougon, eut pitié de lui et demanda à l’emmener. Pierre fut ravi ; il laissa partir l’enfant, sans même parler d’augmenter la faible pension qu’il servait à Adélaïde, et qui désormais devrait suffire pour deux.","Macquart soon had to give up trying to drag this fat, industrious young man into his campaign against the Rougons, whom he treated as miserly and sneaky, out of the spite of an idler. But he thought he discovered the accomplice he was looking for in Mouret's second son, Silvère, a fifteen-year-old child. When Mouret was found hanging in his wife's skirts, little Silvere was not even yet going to school. His eldest brother, not knowing what to do with this poor being, took him with him to his uncle. The latter grimaced when he saw the child arrive; he did not intend to push his compensations so far as to feed a useless mouth. Silvère, whom Félicité also took a dislike to, grew up in tears, like an abandoned wretch, when his grandmother, on one of the rare visits she made to the Rougons, took pity on him and asked to take him away. Pierre was delighted; he let the child go, without even mentioning increasing the meager pension he was paying in Adelaide, which should henceforth suffice for two.","Macquart soon had to abandon all hope of dragging this big industrious fellow into his campaign against the Rougons; whereupon, with all the spite of a lazybones, he regarded him as a cunning miser.

"La porte s’ouvrit, Vuillet entra. Il salua humblement, avec son clignement de paupières, son sourire pincé de sacristain. Puis il vint tendre sa main humide à Rougon et aux deux autres. Vuillet avait fait ses petites affaires tout seul. Il s’était taillé lui-même sa part du gâteau, comme aurait dit Félicité. Il avait vu, par le soupirail de sa cave, les insurgés venir arrêter le directeur des postes, dont les bureaux étaient voisins de sa librairie. Aussi, dès le matin, à l’heure même où Rougon s’asseyait dans le fauteuil du maire, était-il allé s’installer tranquillement dans le cabinet du directeur. Il connaissait les employés ; il les avait reçus à leur arrivée, en leur disant qu’il remplacerait leur chef jusqu’à son retour, et qu’ils n’eussent à s’inquiéter de rien. Puis il avait fouillé le courrier du matin avec une curiosité mal dissimulée ; il flairait les lettres ; il semblait en chercher une particulièrement. Sans doute sa situation nouvelle répondait à un de ses plans secrets, car il alla, dans son contentement, jusqu’à donner à un de ses employés un exemplaire des Œuvres badines de Piron. Vuillet avait un fonds très assorti de livres obscènes, qu’il cachait dans un grand tiroir, sous une couche de chapelets et d’images saintes ; c’était lui qui inondait la ville de photographies et de gravures honteuses, sans que cela nuisît le moins du monde à la vente des paroissiens. Cependant il dut s’effrayer, dans la matinée, de la façon cavalière dont il s’était emparé de l’hôtel des postes. Il songea à faire ratifier son usurpation. Et c’est pourquoi il accourait chez Rougon, qui devenait décidément un puissant personnage.","The door opened, Vuillet entered. He bowed humbly, with his winking eyelids, his pinched sexton smile. Then he came and stretched out his moist hand to Rougon and the two others. Vuillet had done his little business all by himself. He had cut his own piece of the pie, as Félicité would have said. He had seen, through the ventilator of his cellar, the insurgents coming to arrest the postmaster, whose offices were near his bookstore. So, in the morning, at the very hour when Rougon sat down in the mayor's chair, he had quietly installed himself in the director's office. He knew the employees; he had received them on their arrival, telling them that he would replace their chief until his return, and that they need not worry about anything. Then he had gone through the morning mail with ill-disguised curiosity; he smelled the letters; he seemed to be looking for one in particular. Doubtless his new situation corresponded to one of his secret plans, for he went so far as to give one of his employees a copy of Piron's Œuvres badines. Vuillet had a very assorted stock of obscene books, which he hid in a large drawer, under a layer of rosaries and holy images; it was he who flooded the city with shameful photographs and engravings, without doing the least harm to the sale of the parishioners. However, he must have taken alarm in the morning at the cavalier manner in which he had taken possession of the post office. He thought of having his usurpation ratified. And that is why he hastened to Rougon, who was definitely becoming a powerful personage.","Suddenly the door opened and Vuillet entered, bowing humbly, with blinking glance and stiff sacristan’s smile. Then he held out his moist hand to Rougon and the two others. Vuillet had settled his little affairs alone. He had cut his own slice out of the cake, as Félicité would have said. While peeping through the ventilator of his cellar he had seen the insurgents arrest the postmaster, whose offices were near his bookshop. At daybreak, therefore, at the moment when Rougon was comfortably seated in the mayor’s arm-chair, he had quietly installed himself in the postmaster’s office. He knew the clerks; so he received them on their arrival, told them that he would replace their chief until his return, and that meantime they need be in nowise uneasy. Then he ransacked the morning mail with ill-concealed curiosity. He examined the letters, and seemed to be seeking a particular one. His new berth doubtless suited his secret plans, for his satisfaction became so great that he actually gave one of the clerks a copy of the “Oeuvres Badines de Piron.” Vuillet, it should be mentioned, did business in objectionable literature, which he kept concealed in a large drawer, under the stock of heads and religious images. It is probable that he felt some slight qualms at the free-and-easy manner in which he had taken possession of the post office, and recognised the desirability of getting his usurpation confirmed as far as possible. At all events, he had thought it well to call upon Rougon, who was fast becoming an important personage.","Suddenly the door opened and Vuillet entered.

"Enfin Granoux parut. Il s’arrêta un instant sur le seuil, la main droite dans sa redingote boutonnée ; sa grosse face blême, qui jubilait, essayait vainement de cacher son émotion sous un grand air de dignité.

Il lui tendit la main.","At last Granoux appeared.

He held out his hand to her.","At last Granoux appeared.

Granoux walked straight up to Rougon, through two lines of visitors, and held out his hand to him.","At last Granoux appeared.

"Cette nuit-là, la Viorne, au bas des rochers de la route, grondait d’une voix rauque. Dans ce roulement continu du torrent, les insurgés distinguaient des lamentations aigres de tocsin. Les villages épars dans la plaine, de l’autre côté de la rivière, se soulevaient, sonnant l’alarme, allumant des feux. Jusqu’au matin, la colonne en marche, qu’un glas funèbre semblait suivre dans la nuit d’un tintement obstiné, vit ainsi l’insurrection courir le long de la vallée comme une traînée de poudre. Les feux tachaient l’ombre de points sanglants ; des chants lointains venaient, par souffles affaiblis ; toute la vague étendue, noyée sous les buées blanchâtres de la lune, s’agitait confusément, avec de brusques frissons de colère. Pendant des lieues, le spectacle resta le même.","That night, the Viburnum, below the rocks of the road, growled hoarsely. In this continuous rolling of the torrent, the insurgents distinguished the sour lamentations of tocsin. The scattered villages on the plain, on the other side of the river, rose up, sounding the alarm, lighting fires. Until morning, the marching column, which a funeral knell seemed to follow in the night with a stubborn tinkling, thus saw the insurrection run along the valley like a trail of powder. The fires stained the shadow with bloody spots; distant songs came, in faint breaths; the whole extended wave, drowned in the whitish mists of the moon, stirred confusedly, with sudden shudders of anger. For leagues, the spectacle remained the same.","On the night in question, the Viorne roared hoarsely at the foot of the rocks bordering the route. Amidst the continuous rumbling of the torrent, the insurgents could distinguish the sharp, wailing notes of the tocsin. The villages scattered about the plain, on the other side of the river, were rising, sounding alarm-bells, and lighting signal fires. Till daybreak the marching column, which the persistent tolling of a mournful knell seemed to pursue in the darkness, thus beheld the insurrection spreading along the valley, like a train of powder. The fires showed in the darkness like stains of blood; echoes of distant songs were wafted to them; the whole vague distance, blurred by the whitish vapours of the moon, stirred confusedly, and suddenly broke into a spasm of anger. For leagues and leagues the scene remained the same.","On that particular night the Viorne was roaring at the foot of the rocks bordering the roadway.

"« Alors, dit-il, un insurgé se précipite sur moi. J’écarte le fauteuil de M. le maire, je prends mon homme à la gorge. Et je le serre, vous pensez ! Mais mon fusil me gênait.

"Restait Adélaïde. Pour rien au monde, Pierre ne voulait continuer à demeurer avec elle. Elle le compromettait. C’était par elle qu’il aurait désiré commencer. Mais il se trouvait pris entre deux alternatives fort embarrassantes : la garder, et alors recevoir les éclaboussures de sa honte, s’attacher au pied un boulet qui arrêterait l’élan de son ambition ; la chasser, et à coup sûr se faire montrer au doigt comme un mauvais fils, ce qui aurait dérangé ses calculs de bonhomie. Sentant qu’il allait avoir besoin de tout le monde, il souhaitait que son nom rentrât en grâce auprès de Plassans entier. Un seul moyen était à prendre, celui d’amener Adélaïde à s’en aller d’elle-même. Pierre ne négligeait rien pour obtenir ce résultat. Il se croyait parfaitement excusé de ses duretés par l’inconduite de sa mère. Il la punissait comme on punit un enfant. Les rôles étaient renversés. Sous cette férule toujours levée, la pauvre femme se courbait. Elle était à peine âgée de quarante-deux ans, et elle avait des balbutiements d’épouvante, des airs vagues et humbles de vieille femme tombée en enfance. Son fils continuait à la tuer de ses regards sévères, espérant qu’elle s’enfuirait, le jour où elle serait à bout de courage. La malheureuse souffrait horriblement de honte, de désirs contenus, de lâchetés acceptées, recevant passivement les coups et retournant quand même à Macquart, prête à mourir sur la place plutôt que de céder. Il y avait des nuits où elle se serait levée pour courir se jeter dans la Viorne, si sa chair faible de femme nerveuse n’avait eu une peur atroce de la mort. Plusieurs fois, elle rêva de fuir, d’aller retrouver son amant à la frontière. Ce qui la retenait au logis, dans les silences méprisants et les secrètes brutalités de son fils, c’était de ne savoir où se réfugier. Pierre sentait que depuis longtemps elle l’aurait quitté, si elle avait eu un asile. Il attendait l’occasion de lui louer quelque part un petit logement, lorsqu’un accident, sur lequel il n’osait compter, brusqua la réalisation de ses désirs. On apprit, dans le faubourg, que Macquart venait d’être tué à la frontière par le coup de feu d’un douanier, au moment où il entrait en France toute une cargaison de montres de Genève. L’histoire était vraie. On ne ramena pas même le corps du contrebandier, qui fut enterré dans le cimetière d’un petit village des montagnes. La douleur d’Adélaïde fut stupide. Son fils, qui l’observa curieusement, ne lui vit pas verser une larme. Macquart l’avait faite sa légataire. Elle hérita de la masure de l’impasse Saint-Mittre et de la carabine du défunt, qu’un contrebandier, échappé aux balles des douaniers, lui rapporta loyalement. Dès le lendemain, elle se retira dans la petite maison ; elle pendit la carabine au-dessus de la cheminée, et vécut là, étrangère au monde, solitaire, muette.","There remained Adelaide. For nothing in the world did Pierre want to continue living with her. She was compromising him. It was with her that he would have liked to begin. But he found himself caught between two very embarrassing alternatives: to keep it, and then to receive the splashes of his shame, to attach to his foot a ball and chain which would stop the momentum of his ambition; drive her away, and certainly be pointed out as a bad son, which would have disturbed his calculations of good nature. Feeling that he was going to need everyone, he wanted his name to return to favor with the whole of Plassans. There was only one way to go, that of inducing Adelaide to leave on her own. Pierre neglected nothing to obtain this result. He thought himself perfectly excused for his harshness by his mother's misconduct. He punished her as one punishes a child. The roles were reversed. Beneath this ever-raising rod, the poor woman bowed. She was barely forty-two years old, and she had the stammerings of terror, the vague and humble airs of an old woman fallen into childhood. Her son continued to kill her with his stern looks, hoping that she would run away the day she ran out of courage. The unfortunate woman suffered horribly from shame, from repressed desires, from accepted cowardice, passively receiving the blows and returning all the same to Macquart, ready to die on the spot rather than yield. There were nights when she would have gotten up to run and throw herself into the Viburnum, if her weak flesh of a nervous woman had not had an atrocious fear of death. Several times, she dreamed of fleeing, of going to find her lover at the border. What kept her at home, in the contemptuous silences and secret brutalities of her son, was not knowing where to take refuge. Pierre felt that she would have left him long ago if she had had an asylum. He was waiting for the opportunity to rent her a small lodging somewhere, when an accident, on which he dared not count, abruptly brought about the realization of his desires. It was learned in the faubourg that Macquart had just been killed at the frontier by a shot from a customs officer, just as he was entering France with a whole cargo of watches from Geneva. The story was true. They did not even bring back the body of the smuggler, who was buried in the cemetery of a small village in the mountains. Adelaide's pain was stupid. Her son, who watched her curiously, did not see her shed a tear. Macquart had made her his legatee. She inherited the hovel in the impasse Saint-Mittre and the rifle of the deceased, which a smuggler, escaping the bullets of the customs officers, loyally brought back to her. The next day she retired to the little house; she hung the rifle above the fireplace, and lived there, a stranger to the world, solitary, mute.","Adélaïde now remained to be disposed of. Nothing in the world would have induced Pierre to live with her any longer. She was compromising him; it was with her that he would have liked to make a start. But he found himself between two very embarrassing alternatives: to keep her, and thus, in a measure, share her disgrace, and bind a fetter to his feet which would arrest him in his ambitious flight; or to turn her out, with the certainty of being pointed at as a bad son, which would have robbed him of the reputation for good nature which he desired. Knowing that he would be in want of everybody, he desired to secure an untarnished name throughout Plassans. There was but one method to adopt, namely, to induce Adélaïde to leave of her own accord. Pierre neglected nothing to accomplish this end. He considered his mother’s misconduct a sufficient excuse for his own hard-heartedness. He punished her as one would chastise a child. The tables were turned. The poor woman cowered under the stick which, figuratively, was constantly held over her. She was scarcely forty-two years old, and already had the stammerings of terror, and vague, pitiful looks of an old woman in her dotage. Her son continued to stab her with his piercing glances, hoping that she would run away when her courage was exhausted. The unfortunate woman suffered terribly from shame, restrained desire and enforced cowardice, receiving the blows dealt her with passive resignation, and nevertheless returning to Macquart with the determination to die on the spot rather than submit. There were nights when she would have got out of bed, and thrown herself into the Viorne, if with her weak, nervous, nature she had not felt the greatest fear of death. On several occasions she thought of running away and joining her lover on the frontier. It was only because she did not know whither to go that she remained in the house, submitting to her son’s contemptuous silence and secret brutality. Pierre divined that she would have left long ago if she had only had a refuge. He was waiting an opportunity to take a little apartment for her somewhere, when a fortuitous occurrence, which he had not ventured to anticipate, abruptly brought about the realisation of his desires. Information reached the Faubourg that Macquart had just been killed on the frontier by a shot from a custom-house officer, at the moment when he was endeavouring to smuggle a load of Geneva watches into France. The story was true. The smuggler’s body was not even brought home, but was interred in the cemetery of a little mountain village. Adélaïde’s grief plunged her into stupor. Her son, who watched her curiously, did not see her shed a tear. Macquart had made her sole legatee. She inherited his hovel in the Impasse Saint-Mittre, and his carbine, which a fellow-smuggler, braving the balls of the custom-house officers, loyally brought back to her. On the following day she retired to the little house, hung the carbine above the mantelpiece, and lived there estranged from all the world, solitary and silent.","Adélaïde was now the only one left to dispose of. Nothing would have induced Pierre to live with her any longer. She was compromising him. He would have liked to get rid of her first. But he found himself faced by two very embarrassing alternatives: keep her, and thus partake of her disgrace and tie a shackle to his feet which would hold him back in his ambitious course; or turn her out, thus condemning himself to being known as a bad son, which would have robbed him of the reputation for good nature that he desired. Sensing that he would need everybody, he wanted his name to remain untarnished throughout Plassans. There was but one method to adopt, namely, to induce Adélaïde to leave of her own accord. Pierre made every effort to achieve this end. He considered his mother’s misconduct a sufficient excuse for his hard-heartedness. He punished her as one would punish a child. The tables were turned. The poor woman cowered under the stick that was constantly held over her. She was scarcely forty-two, and already had the terrified whimperings and vague, pitiful looks of an old woman in her dotage. Her son continued to stab her with his piercing looks, hoping that she would run away when she could endure it no longer. The poor woman suffered terribly from shame, repressed desire, and feelings of cowardice, accepting her persecution but nevertheless returning to Macquart, determined to die on the spot rather than give in. There were nights when she would have got out of bed and thrown herself in the Viorne if, with her weak, nervous nature, she had not felt terrified of dying. Several times she thought of running away to join her lover at the frontier. It was only because she did not know where to go that she remained in the house, submitting to her son’s silent contempt and subtle brutality. Pierre guessed that she would have left long ago if she had had a refuge. He was waiting for an opportunity to rent a little apartment for her somewhere when a fortuitous event, which he had not dared hope for, suddenly brought about the fulfilment of his wishes.

"Elle trouva Pierre couché, dormant d’un sommeil lourd ; elle approcha un instant la bougie, et regarda, d’un air de pitié, son visage épais, où couraient par moments de légers frissons ; puis elle s’assit au chevet du lit, ôta son bonnet, s’échevela, se donna la mine d’une personne désespérée, et se mit à sangloter très haut.","She found Pierre lying in a heavy sleep; she held the candle close for a moment, and gazed with an air of pity at her thick face, through which ran at times slight shivers; then she sat down at the bedside, took off her bonnet, took off her hair, put on the look of a desperate person, and began to sob very loudly.","She found Pierre in bed, sleeping heavily; she brought the candle near him for an instant, and gazed with an air of compassion, at his big face, across which slight twitches occasionally passed; then she sat down at the head of the bed, took off her cap, let her hair fall loose, assumed the appearance of one in despair, and began to sob quite loudly.","She found Pierre in bed, fast asleep; she held the candle close to him for a moment, and gazed with an air of pity at his thick-set face, which twitched slightly from time to time; then she sat down at the head of the bed, took off her bonnet, let her hair fall loose, assumed a look of despair, and began to sob quite loudly."

"L’herbe épaisse étouffait le bruit de leurs pas. Ils étaient noyés dans un flot de ténèbres, bercés entre deux rives sombres, ne voyant qu’une bande d’un bleu foncé, semée d’étoiles, au-dessus de leur tête. Et, dans ce vague du sol qu’ils foulaient, dans cette ressemblance de l’allée à un ruisseau d’ombre coulant sous le ciel noir et or, ils éprouvaient une émotion indéfinissable, ils baissaient la voix, bien que personne ne pût les entendre.

"Elle revint à pas lents, songeuse. Elle fit même un détour, passa par le cours Sauvaire, comme pour réfléchir plus longuement et plus à l’aise, avant de rentrer chez elle.

"Au sortir de Plassans, les insurgés avaient pris la route d’Orchères. Ils devaient arriver à cette ville vers dix heures du matin. La route remonte le cours de la Viorne, en suivant à mi-côte les détours des collines aux pieds desquelles coule le torrent. À gauche, la plaine s’élargit, immense tapis vert, piqué de loin en loin par les taches grises des villages. À droite, la chaîne des Garrigues dresse ses pics désolés, ses champs de pierres, ses blocs couleur de rouille, comme roussis par le soleil. Le grand chemin, formant chaussée du côté de la rivière, passe au milieu de rocs énormes, entre lesquels se montrent, à chaque pas, des bouts de la vallée. Rien n’est plus sauvage, plus étrangement grandiose, que cette route taillée dans le flanc même des collines. La nuit surtout, ces lieux ont une horreur sacrée. Sous la lumière pâle, les insurgés s’avançaient comme dans une avenue de ville détruite, ayant aux deux bords des débris de temples ; la lune faisait de chaque rocher un fût de colonne tronqué, un chapiteau écroulé, une muraille trouée de mystérieux portiques. En haut, la masse des Garrigues dormait, à peine blanchie d’une teinte laiteuse, pareille à une immense cité cyclopéenne dont les tours, les obélisques, les maisons aux terrasses hautes, auraient caché une moitié du ciel ; et, dans les fonds, du côté de la plaine, se creusait, s’élargissait un océan de clartés diffuses, une étendue vague, sans bornes, où flottaient des nappes de brouillard lumineux. La bande insurrectionnelle aurait pu croire qu’elle suivait une chaussée gigantesque, un chemin de ronde construit au bord d’une mer phosphorescente et tournant autour d’une Babel inconnue.","Leaving Plassans, the insurgents had taken the road to Orchères. They were to arrive in this town around ten o'clock in the morning. The road goes up the course of the Viorne, following halfway up the detours of the hills at the foot of which the torrent flows. To the left, the plain widens out, an immense green carpet, dotted here and there by the gray spots of the villages. To the right, the chain of Garrigues raises its desolate peaks, its fields of stones, its rust-colored blocks, as if scorched by the sun. The main road, forming a causeway on the side of the river, passes through the middle of enormous rocks, between which, at each step, are visible ends of the valley. Nothing is wilder, more strangely grandiose, than this road cut into the very side of the hills. At night especially, these places have a sacred horror. Under the dim light, the insurgents were advancing as though in a destroyed city avenue, having on both sides the remains of temples; the moon made of each rock a trunk of a truncated column, a crumbling capital, a wall pierced with mysterious porticoes. Above, the mass of the Garrigues slept, barely bleached with a milky hue, like an immense cyclopean city whose towers, obelisks, houses with high terraces, would have hidden half the sky; and, in the depths, on the side of the plain, an ocean of diffuse light grew hollow, widened, a vague expanse, boundless, in which floated sheets of luminous mist. The insurrectionary band might have believed that it was following a gigantic causeway, a walkway built on the edge of a phosphorescent sea and turning around an unknown Babel.","On quitting Plassans, the insurgents had taken the road to Orcheres. They expected to reach that town at about ten o’clock in the morning. The road skirts the course of the Viorne, following at some height the windings of the hillocks, below which the torrent flows. On the left, the plain spreads out like an immense green carpet, dotted here and there with grey villages. On the right, the chain of the Garrigues rears its desolate peaks, its plateaux of stones, its huge rusty boulders that look as though they had been reddened by the sun. The high road, embanked along the riverside, passes on amidst enormous rocks, between which glimpses of the valley are caught at every step. Nothing could be wilder or more strikingly grand than this road out of the hillside. At night time, especially, it inspires one with a feeling of deep awe. The insurgents advanced under the pale light, along what seemed the chief street of some ruined town, bordered on either side with fragments of temples. The moon turned each rock into a broken column, crumbling capital, or stretch of wall pierced with mysterious arches. On high slumbered the mass of the Garrigues, suffused with a milky tinge, and resembling some immense Cyclopean city whose towers, obelisks, houses and high terraces hid one half of the heavens; and in the depths below, on the side of the plain, was a spreading ocean of diffused light, vague and limitless, over which floated masses of luminous haze. The insurrectionary force might well have thought they were following some gigantic causeway, making their rounds along some military road built on the shore of a phosphorescent sea, and circling some unknown Babel.","On leaving Plassans the insurgents had taken the road to Orchères.

"Il y avait là trois ou quatre négociants retirés qui tremblaient pour leurs rentes, et qui appelaient de tous leurs vœux un gouvernement sage et fort.

Sa bouche en bec de lièvre, fendue à cinq ou six centimètres du nez, ses yeux ronds, son air à la fois satisfait et ahuri, le faisaient ressembler à une oie grasse qui digère dans la salutaire crainte du cuisinier. Il parlait peu, ne pouvant trouver les mots ; il n’écoutait que lorsqu’on accusait les républicains de vouloir piller les maisons des riches, se contentant alors de devenir rouge à faire craindre une apoplexie, et de murmurer des invectives sourdes, au milieu desquelles revenaient les mots « fainéants, scélérats, voleurs, assassins ».","There were three or four retired merchants there, who trembled for their rents, and who called with all their wishes for a wise and strong government. A former almond merchant, member of the municipal council, Mr. Isidore Granoux, was like the leader of this group. His hare's mouth, split five or six centimeters from the nose, his round eyes, his look both satisfied and bewildered, made him look like a fat goose digesting in the salutary fear of the cook. He spoke little, unable to find the words; he only listened when the Republicans were accused of wanting to loot the houses of the rich, contenting himself then with turning red enough to make one fear an apoplexy, and murmuring deaf invectives, in the middle of which recurred the words ""lazy people, scoundrels, thieves"". , killers”.","Among those who came were three or four retired merchants who trembled for their money, and clamoured with all their might for a wise and strong government.

His hare-lipped mouth was cloven a little way from the nose; his round eyes, his air of mingled satisfaction and astonishment, made him resemble a fat goose whose digestion is attended by wholesome terror of the cook. He spoke little, having no command of words; and he only pricked up his ears when anyone accused the Republicans of wishing to pillage the houses of the rich; whereupon he would colour up to such a degree as to make one fear an approaching apoplectic fit, and mutter low imprecations, in which the words “idlers,” “scoundrels,” “thieves,” and “assassins” frequently recurred.","Among those who came were three or four retired merchants who were terrified of losing their money, and clamoured for a wise and strong government.

"Ah ! quelles heureuses et tièdes soirées ! On était alors dans les premiers jours de septembre, mois de clair soleil en Provence. Les amoureux ne pouvaient guère se rejoindre que vers neuf heures. Miette arrivait par son mur. Elle acquit bientôt une telle habileté à franchir cet obstacle, qu’elle était presque toujours sur l’ancienne pierre tombale avant que Silvère lui eût tendu les bras. Et elle riait de son tour de force, elle restait là un instant, essoufflée, décoiffée, donnant de petites tapes sur sa jupe pour la faire retomber. Son amoureux l’appelait en riant « méchant galopin ». Au fond, il aimait la crânerie de l’enfant. Il la regardait sauter son mur avec la complaisance d’un frère aîné qui assiste aux exercices d’un de ses jeunes frères. Il y avait tant de puérilité dans leur tendresse naissante ! À plusieurs reprises, ils firent le projet d’aller un jour dénicher des oiseaux, au bord de la Viorne.","Ah! what happy and warm evenings! We were then in the first days of September, a month of bright sunshine in Provence. The lovers could hardly meet until around nine o'clock. Miette came through his wall. She soon acquired such skill in surmounting this obstacle that she was almost always on the old tombstone before Silvere held out his arms to her. And she laughed at her feat, she stood there for a moment, out of breath, disheveled, slapping her skirt to make it fall. Her lover called her, laughingly, ""bad rascal"". Basically, he loved the child's swagger. He watched her jump the wall with the complacency of an older brother watching the exercises of one of his younger brothers. There was so much childishness in their budding tenderness! On several occasions, they made the project of one day going to find birds, on the banks of the Viorne.","Ah! how happy those warm evenings were!

"À partir du Jas-Meiffren, la grande route descend par une pente douce jusqu’au fond d’une vallée qui sert de lit à une petite rivière, la Viorne, ruisseau l’été et torrent l’hiver. Les deux rangées d’ormes continuaient, à cette époque, et faisaient de la route une magnifique avenue, coupant la côte, plantée de blé et de vignes maigres, d’un large ruban d’arbres gigantesques. Par cette nuit de décembre, sous la lune claire et froide, les champs fraîchement labourés s’étendaient aux deux abords du chemin, pareils à de vastes couches d’ouate grisâtre, qui auraient amorti tous les bruits de l’air. Au loin, la voix sourde de la Viorne mettait seule un frisson dans l’immense paix de la campagne.","From Jas-Meiffren, the main road descends gently to the bottom of a valley which serves as the bed of a small river, the Viorne, a stream in summer and a torrent in winter. The two rows of elms continued, at this time, and made the road a magnificent avenue, cutting the coast, planted with wheat and meager vines, with a wide ribbon of gigantic trees. On this December night, under the clear, cold moon, the freshly plowed fields stretched out on both sides of the road, like vast layers of greyish wadding, which would have deadened all the noises of the air. In the distance, the dull voice of the Viburnum alone sent a shiver through the immense peace of the countryside.","Beyond the Jas-Meiffren the road descends with a gentle slope to a valley, which serves as the bed of a little rivulet, the Viorne, a brook in summer but a torrent in winter. The rows of elms still extended the whole way at that time, making the high road a magnificent avenue, which cast a broad band of gigantic trees across the hill, which was planted with corn and stunted vines. On that December night, under the clear cold moonlight, the newly-ploughed fields stretching away on either hand resembled vast beds of greyish wadding which deadened every sound in the atmosphere. The dull murmur of the Viorne in the distance alone sent a quivering thrill through the profound silence of the country-side.","Beyond the Jas-Meiffren the road slopes gently down to a valley, which serves as the bed of a little rivulet, the Viorne, a brook in summer but a torrent in winter. * The double row of elms still extended the whole way, making the main road a magnificent avenue; this broad band of gigantic trees stretched across the hill, which was planted with corn and stunted vines.

"« Eh ! taisez-vous, mauvaises langues ! dit-il en lâchant un brancard de carriole qu’il examinait. N’avez-vous pas honte de vous acharner après une enfant ? Je l’ai vue, moi, cette petite. Elle a un air très honnête. Puis on m’a dit qu’elle ne boudait pas devant le travail et qu’elle faisait déjà la besogne d’une femme de trente ans. Il y a ici des fainéants qui ne la valent pas. Je lui souhaite pour plus tard un bon mari qui fasse taire les méchants propos. »","“Hey! shut up, gossips! he said, letting go of a cart stretcher he was examining. Aren't you ashamed of going after a child? I saw her, me, this little one. She looks very honest. Then I was told that she was not sulking in front of work and that she was already doing the work of a woman of thirty. There are lazy people here who are not worth it. I wish her for later a good husband who silences the bad words. »","“Hold your tongues, you foul mouths!” he said, as he let fall the shaft of a cart that he had been examining. “You ought to be ashamed of yourselves for being so hard upon the child. I’ve seen her, the little thing looks a very good girl. Besides, I’m told she doesn’t mind work, and already does as much as any woman of thirty. There are some lazy fellows here who aren’t a match for her. I hope, later on, that she’ll get a good husband who’ll stop this evil talk.”","‘Shut up, you foul-mouthed lot!’ he said, letting go of the shaft of a cart he had been looking at. ‘You should be ashamed to talk like that about a child. I’ve seen her, and she seems very nice. And I hear she doesn’t mind work; she already does as much as a grown woman. There are some lazy people around here who couldn’t do as much.

"Mais si le jeune homme rêvait tout éveillé la glorification de son amoureuse, il avait de tels besoins de justice, qu’il la faisait souvent pleurer en lui parlant de son père. Malgré les attendrissements profonds que l’amitié de Silvère avait mis en elle, elle avait encore de loin en loin des réveils brusques, des heures mauvaises, où les entêtements, les rébellions de sa nature sanguine la roidissaient, les yeux durs, les lèvres serrées. Alors elle soutenait que son père avait bien fait de tuer le gendarme, que la terre appartient à tout le monde, qu’on a le droit de tirer des coups de fusil où l’on veut et quand on veut. Et Silvère, de sa voix grave, lui expliquait le code comme il le comprenait, avec des commentaires étranges qui auraient fait bondir toute la magistrature de Plassans. Ces causeries avaient lieu, le plus souvent, dans quelque coin perdu des prés Sainte-Claire. Les tapis d’herbe, d’un noir verdâtre, s’étendaient à perte de vue, sans qu’un seul arbre tachât l’immense nappe, et le ciel semblait énorme, emplissant de ses étoiles la rondeur nue de l’horizon. Les enfants étaient comme bercés dans cette mer de verdure. Miette luttait longtemps ; elle demandait à Silvère s’il eût mieux valu que son père se laissât tuer par le gendarme, et Silvère gardait un instant le silence ; puis il disait que, dans un tel cas, il valait mieux être la victime que le meurtrier, et que c’était un grand malheur, lorsqu’on tuait son semblable, même en état de légitime défense. Pour lui, la loi était chose sainte, les juges avaient eu raison d’envoyer Chantegreil au bagne. La jeune fille s’emportait, elle aurait battu son ami, elle lui criait qu’il avait aussi mauvais cœur que les autres. Et comme il continuait à défendre fermement ses idées de justice, elle finissait par éclater en sanglots, en balbutiant qu’il rougissait sans doute d’elle, puisqu’il lui rappelait toujours le crime de son père. Ces discussions se terminaient dans les larmes, dans une émotion commune. Mais l’enfant avait beau pleurer, reconnaître qu’elle avait peut-être tort, elle gardait tout au fond d’elle sa sauvagerie, son emportement sanguin. Une fois, elle raconta avec de longs rires comment un gendarme devant elle, en tombant de cheval, s’était cassé la jambe. D’ailleurs Miette ne vivait plus que pour Silvère. Quand celui-ci la questionnait sur son oncle et sur son cousin, elle répondait « qu’elle ne savait pas », et s’il insistait, par crainte qu’on la rendît trop malheureuse au Jas-Meiffren, elle disait qu’elle travaillait beaucoup, que rien n’était changé. Elle croyait pourtant que Justin avait fini par savoir ce qui la faisait chanter le matin et lui mettait de la douceur plein les yeux. Mais elle ajoutait :","But if the young man dreamed while awake of the glorification of his lover, he had such a need for justice that he often made her cry by talking to her about his father. In spite of the deep tenderness that Silvere's friendship had placed in her, she still had from time to time sudden awakenings, bad hours, when the stubbornness, the rebellions of her sanguine nature stiffened her, her eyes hard, her lips tight . So she maintained that her father had done well to kill the policeman, that the land belongs to everyone, that one has the right to fire guns where one wants and when one wants. And Silvere, in his deep voice, explained the code to him as he understood it, with strange comments that would have made the entire magistrature of Plassans jump. These talks usually took place in some remote corner of the Sainte-Claire meadows. The carpets of greenish-black grass stretched as far as the eye could see, without a single tree staining the immense sheet, and the sky seemed enormous, filling the bare roundness of the horizon with its stars. The children were cradled in this sea of greenery. Miette struggled for a long time; she asked Silvere if it would have been better for her father to let himself be killed by the gendarme, and Silvere remained silent for a moment; then he said that, in such a case, it was better to be the victim than the murderer, and that it was a great misfortune to kill one's fellow man, even in a state of self-defence. For him, the law was a holy thing, the judges had been right to send Chantegreil to prison. The young girl got carried away, she would have beaten her friend, she shouted at him that he had as bad a heart as the others. And as he continued to firmly defend his ideas of justice, she ended by bursting into tears, stammering that he was no doubt blushing at her, since he always reminded her of her father's crime. These discussions ended in tears, in a common emotion. But in vain the child cried, recognized that she was perhaps wrong, she kept deep down inside her her savagery, her sanguine anger. Once she told with long laughs how a gendarme in front of her, falling from his horse, had broken his leg. Besides, Miette no longer lived except for Silvere. When he questioned her about her uncle and her cousin, she answered ""that she didn't know"", and if he insisted, for fear that they would make her too unhappy at Jas-Meiffren, she would say that she worked a lot, that nothing was changed. Yet she believed that Justin had come to know what made her sing in the morning and put sweetness in her eyes. But she added:","However, if the young man dreamt like this of the glorification of his sweetheart, he also showed such passion for justice that he often made her weep on speaking to her about her father. In spite of the softening effect which Silvère’s friendship had had upon her, she still at times gave way to angry outbreaks of temper, when all the stubbornness and rebellion latent in her nature stiffened her with scowling eyes and tightly-drawn lips. She would then contend that her father had done quite right to kill the gendarme, that the earth belongs to everybody, and that one has the right to fire a gun when and where one likes. Thereupon Silvère, in a grave voice, explained the law to her as he understood it, with strange commentaries which would have startled the whole magistracy of Plassans. These discussions took place most often in some remote corner of the Sainte-Claire meadows. The grassy carpet of a dusky green hue stretched further than they could see, undotted even by a single tree, and the sky seemed colossal, spangling the bare horizon with the stars. It seemed to the young couple as if they were being rocked on a sea of verdure. Miette argued the point obstinately; she asked Silvère if her father should have let the gendarme kill him, and Silvère, after a momentary silence, replied that, in such a case, it was better to be the victim than the murderer, and that it was a great misfortune for anyone to kill a fellow man, even in legitimate defence. The law was something holy to him, and the judges had done right in sending Chantegreil to the galleys. At this the girl grew angry, and almost struck her sweetheart, crying out that he was as heartless as the rest. And as he still firmly defended his ideas of justice, she finished by bursting into sobs, and stammering that he was doubtless ashamed of her, since he was always reminding her of her father’s crime. These discussions ended in tears, in mutual emotion. But although the child cried, and acknowledged that she was perhaps wrong, she still retained deep within her a wild resentful temper. She once related, with hearty laughter, that she had seen a gendarme fall off his horse and break his leg. Apart from this, Miette only lived for Silvère. When he asked her about her uncle and cousin, she replied that “She did not know;” and if he pressed her, fearing that they were making her too unhappy at the Jas-Meiffren, she simply answered that she worked hard, and that nothing had changed. She believed, however, that Justin had at last found out what made her sing in the morning, and filled her eyes with delight. But she added: “What does it matter?","However, if the young man dreamt of his sweetheart’s glorification, he also showed such passion for justice that he often made her weep when he spoke to her about her father.

"Comme on enlevait les cadavres, Aristide vint les flairer. Il les regarda sur tous les sens, humant l’air, interrogeant les visages. Il avait la mine sèche, les yeux clairs. De sa main, la veille emmaillotée, libre à cette heure, il souleva la blouse d’un des morts, pour mieux voir sa blessure. Cet examen parut le convaincre, lui ôter un doute. Il serra les lèvres, resta là un moment sans dire un mot, puis se retira pour aller presser la distribution de l’Indépendant, dans lequel il avait mis un grand article. Le long des maisons, il se rappelait ce mot de sa mère : « Tu verras demain ! » Il avait vu, c’était très fort ; ça l’épouvantait même un peu.","As the corpses were being removed, Aristide came to smell them. He looked at them in all directions, sniffing the air, questioning the faces. He looked dry, his eyes clear. With his hand, swaddled the day before, free at this hour, he lifted the blouse of one of the dead, the better to see his wound. This examination seemed to convince him, to remove his doubts. He pressed his lips together, stood there a moment without saying a word, then retired to go and hasten the distribution of the Independent, in which he had put a large article. Along the houses, he remembered his mother's words: ""You'll see tomorrow!"" He had seen, it was very strong; it even scared him a little.","While the corpses were being removed, Aristide came to look at them. He examined them on all sides, sniffing and looking inquisitively at their faces. His eyes were bright, and he had a sharp expression of countenance.

This examination seemed to convince him and remove all doubt from his mind. He bit his lips, remained there for a moment in silence, and then went off for the purpose of hastening the issue of the “Indépendant,” for which he had written a most important article. And as he hurried along beside the houses he recalled his mother’s words: “You will see to-morrow!” Well, he had seen now; it was very clever; it even frightened him somewhat.","While the corpses were being removed Aristide came to look at them. He examined them from all angles, sniffing and studying their faces. His eyes shone and he had a hard expression.

"Ces hommes, qui marchaient dans l’aveuglement de la fièvre que les événements de Paris avaient mise au cœur des républicains, s’exaltaient au spectacle de cette longue bande de terre toute secouée de révolte.

Et leur esprit rude, avec cette naïveté et cette illusion des foules, concevait une victoire facile et certaine. Ils auraient saisi et fusillé comme traître quiconque leur aurait dit, à cette heure, que seuls ils avaient le courage du devoir, tandis que le reste du pays, écrasé de terreur, se laissait lâchement garrotter.","These men, who marched in the blindness of the fever which the events in Paris had placed in the hearts of the Republicans, were exalted at the sight of this long strip of land all shaken by revolt. Intoxicated by the enthusiasm of the general uprising they dreamed of, they believed that France was following them, they imagined seeing, beyond the Viorne, in the vast sea of diffused light, endless lines of men running , like them, to the defense of the Republic. And their rough spirit, with that naivety and that illusion of crowds, conceived an easy and certain victory. They would have seized and shot as a traitor whoever had told them, at that hour, that they alone had the courage of duty, while the rest of the country, crushed with terror, allowed itself to be cowardly bound.","These men, marching on under the blind impetus of the fever with which the events in Paris had inspired Republican hearts, became elated at seeing that long stretch of country quivering with revolt. Intoxicated with enthusiastic belief in the general insurrection of which they dreamed, they fancied that France was following them; on the other side of the Viorne, in that vast ocean of diffused light, they imagined there were endless files of men rushing like themselves to the defence of the Republic. All simplicity and delusion, as multitudes so often are, they imagined, in their uncultured minds, that victory was easy and certain. They would have seized and shot as a traitor any one who had then asserted that they were the only ones who had the courage of their duty, and that the rest of the country, overwhelmed with fright, was pusillanimously allowing itself to be garrotted.","The men, marching under the blind impetus of the passion which events in Paris had inspired in republican hearts, were excited to see the whole region rising up in revolt.

"Les mots lui manquaient, non qu’elle eût conscience de la honte, mais parce qu’elle ignorait ce qu’elle désirait. Elle était simplement secouée par une sourde révolte intérieure et par un besoin d’infini dans la joie.","Words failed her, not because she was aware of the shame, but because she did not know what she wanted. She was simply shaken by a dull inner revolt and by a need for infinity in joy.","The thought of approaching death had excited her; she no longer felt herself blushing, but hung upon her love, while he in faltering voice repeated: “I love you!","She did not know how to continue, not because she felt ashamed, but because she did not know what she wanted. She was simply overwhelmed by an unconscious inner revolt and a need for infinite pleasure."

"Pascal comprit qu’il n’avait point à se défendre de ses égoïsmes de savant. Sa mère l’accusait simplement de ne pas spéculer sur la situation politique. Il se mit à rire, avec quelque tristesse, et il détourna la conversation. Jamais Félicité ne put l’amener à calculer les chances des partis, ni à s’enrôler dans celui qui paraissait devoir l’emporter.

Granoux l’intéressait comme un animal antédiluvien.","Pascal understood that he had no reason to defend himself from his scholarly selfishness. His mother simply accused him of not speculating on the political situation. He began to laugh, with some sadness, and he diverted the conversation.

However, he continued to come from time to time to spend an evening in the yellow drawing room. Granoux interested him like an antediluvian animal.","Pascal then comprehended that he was not called upon to defend his philosophic egotism.

However, he still occasionally came to spend an evening in the yellow drawing-room. Granoux interested him like an antediluvian animal.","Pascal realized that he was not being asked to defend his selfishness as a scientist. His mother was simply accusing him of not trying to take advantage of the political situation. He laughed rather sadly, and changed the subject.

But he still came to spend an occasional evening in the yellow drawing-room. Granoux fascinated him as a kind of prehistoric animal."

"À cette époque, Miette devenait femme déjà. D’une puberté précoce, elle résista au martyre avec une énergie extraordinaire. Elle s’abandonnait rarement, seulement aux heures où ses fiertés natives mollissaient sous les outrages de son cousin. Bientôt elle supporta d’un œil sec les blessures incessantes de cet être lâche, qui la surveillait en parlant, de peur qu’elle ne lui sautât au visage. Puis, elle savait le faire taire, en le regardant fixement. Elle eut à plusieurs reprises l’envie de se sauver du Jas-Meiffren. Mais elle n’en fit rien, par courage, pour ne pas s’avouer vaincue sous les persécutions qu’elle endurait. En somme, elle gagnait son pain, elle ne volait pas l’hospitalité des Rébufat ; cette certitude suffisait à son orgueil. Elle resta ainsi pour lutter, se roidissant, vivant dans une continuelle pensée de résistance. Sa ligne de conduite fut de faire sa besogne en silence et de se venger des mauvaises paroles par un mépris muet. Elle savait que son oncle abusait trop d’elle pour écouter aisément les insinuations de Justin, qui rêvait de la faire jeter à la porte. Aussi, mettait-elle une sorte de défi à ne pas s’en aller d’elle-même.","At that time, Miette was already becoming a woman. From a precocious puberty, she resisted martyrdom with extraordinary energy. She rarely gave herself up, only at times when her native pride waned under her cousin's insults. Soon she bore with a dry eye the incessant wounds of this cowardly being, who watched her as he spoke, lest she should jump in his face. Then, she knew how to silence him, by staring at him. On several occasions she wanted to run away from Jas-Meiffren. But she did nothing, out of courage, so as not to admit defeat under the persecutions she endured. In short, she earned her bread, she did not steal the hospitality of the Rébufats; this certainty was enough for his pride. She remained thus to struggle, stiffening, living in a continual thought of resistance. His course of action was to do his job in silence and to avenge bad words with silent contempt. She knew that her uncle abused her too much to easily listen to the insinuations of Justin, who dreamed of having her thrown out. Also, she put a kind of challenge not to go away on her own.","She was already growing to womanhood at this period. Of precocious nature, she endured her martyrdom with extraordinary fortitude. She rarely gave way, excepting when her natural pride succumbed to her cousin’s outrages. Soon even, she was able to bear, without a tear, the incessant insults of this cowardly fellow, who ever watched her while he spoke, for fear lest she should fly at his face. Then, too, she learnt to silence him by staring at him fixedly. She had several times felt inclined to run away from the Jas-Meiffren; but she did not do so, as her courage could not brook the idea of confessing that she was vanquished by the persecution she endured. She certainly earned her bread, she did not steal the Rebufats’ hospitality; and this conviction satisfied her pride. So she remained there to continue the struggle, stiffening herself and living on with the one thought of resistance. Her plan was to do her work in silence, and revenge herself for all harsh treatment by mute contempt. She knew that her uncle derived too much advantage from her to listen readily to the insinuations of Justin, who longed to get her turned out of doors.

"– Bonjour, Miette ! »","- Hello, Miette! »","“Good morning, Miette!”","‘Hello, Miette!’"
"Macquart, malgré l’inutilité de ses efforts, ne se découragea pas. Il se dit qu’il suffirait seul à étrangler les Rougon, s’il pouvait jamais les tenir dans un petit coin. Ses rages de fainéant envieux et affamé s’accrurent encore, à la suite d’accidents successifs qui l’obligèrent à se remettre au travail. Vers les premiers jours de l’année 1850, Fine mourut presque subitement d’une fluxion de poitrine, qu’elle avait prise en allant laver un soir le linge de la famille à la Viorne, et en le rapportant mouillé sur son dos ; elle était rentrée trempée d’eau et de sueur, écrasée par ce fardeau qui pesait un poids énorme, et ne s’était plus relevée. Cette mort consterna Macquart. Son revenu le plus assuré lui échappait. Quand il vendit, au bout de quelques jours, le chaudron dans lequel sa femme faisait bouillir ses châtaignes et le chevalet qui lui servait à rempailler ses vieilles chaises, il accusa grossièrement le bon Dieu de lui avoir pris la défunte, cette forte commère dont il avait eu honte et dont il sentait à cette heure tout le prix. Il se rabattit sur le gain de ses enfants avec plus d’avidité. Mais, un mois plus tard, Gervaise, lasse de ses continuelles exigences, s’en alla avec ses deux enfants et Lantier, dont la mère était morte. Les amants se réfugièrent à Paris. Antoine, atterré, s’emporta ignoblement contre sa fille, en lui souhaitant de crever à l’hôpital, comme ses pareilles. Ce débordement d’injures n’améliora pas sa situation qui, décidément, devenait mauvaise. Jean suivit bientôt l’exemple de sa sœur. Il attendit un jour de paye et s’arrangea de façon à toucher lui-même son argent. Il dit en partant à un de ses amis, qui le répéta à Antoine, qu’il ne voulait plus nourrir son fainéant de père, et que si ce dernier s’avisait de le faire ramener par les gendarmes, il était décidé à ne plus toucher une scie ni un rabot. Le lendemain, lorsque Antoine l’eut cherché inutilement et qu’il se trouva seul, sans un sou, dans le logement où, pendant vingt ans, il s’était fait grassement entretenir, il entra dans une rage atroce, donnant des coups de pied aux meubles, hurlant les imprécations les plus monstrueuses. Puis il s’affaissa, il se mit à traîner les pieds, à geindre comme un convalescent. La crainte d’avoir à gagner son pain le rendait positivement malade. Quand Silvère vint le voir, il se plaignit avec des larmes de l’ingratitude des enfants. N’avait-il pas toujours été un bon père ? Jean et Gervaise étaient des monstres qui le récompensaient bien mal de tout ce qu’il avait fait pour eux. Maintenant, ils l’abandonnaient, parce qu’il était vieux et qu’ils ne pouvaient plus rien tirer de lui.","Macquart, despite the futility of his efforts, was not discouraged. He said to himself that he alone would be enough to strangle the Rougons, if he could ever keep them in a little corner. His rages of envious and hungry idler increased further, following successive accidents which forced him to return to work. Towards the first days of the year 1850, Fine died almost suddenly of an inflammation of the chest, which she had caught while going to wash the family linen one evening at the Viorne, and bringing it back wet on her back; she had come back soaked in water and sweat, crushed by this burden which weighed an enormous weight, and had never got up again. This death dismayed Macquart. His most assured income eluded him. When he sold, after a few days, the cauldron in which his wife had boiled his chestnuts and the easel which he used to reupholster his old chairs, he crudely accused God of having taken the deceased from him, this strong gossip of whom he had been ashamed and of which he now felt the full price. He fell back on the gain of his children with more greed. But, a month later, Gervaise, tired of his continual demands, left with her two children and Lantier, whose mother was dead. The lovers took refuge in Paris. Antoine, aghast, flirted ignobly with his daughter, wishing her to die in the hospital, like her fellows. This outpouring of insults did not improve his situation, which was decidedly becoming bad. Jean soon followed his sister's example. He waited for a payday and managed to collect his own money. He said as he left to one of his friends, who repeated it to Antoine, that he no longer wanted to feed his lazy father, and that if the latter took it into his head to have him brought back by the gendarmes, he had decided not to. touch a saw or a plane. The next day, when Antoine had looked for him in vain and he found himself alone, without a penny, in the lodging where, for twenty years, he had been generously supported, he flew into an atrocious rage, throwing foot on the furniture, screaming the most monstrous curses. Then he sagged, he began to drag his feet, moaning like a convalescent. The fear of having to earn his bread made him positively ill. When Silvere came to see him, he complained with tears of the children's ingratitude. Hadn't he always been a good father? Jean and Gervaise were monsters who rewarded him very badly for all he had done for them. Now they were leaving him, because he was old and they couldn't get anything out of him.","Macquart meantime was not discouraged. He said to himself that he would be able to strangle the Rougons alone if he could ever get them into a corner. His envious rage and slothful greed were increased by certain successive accidents which compelled him to resume work. In the early part of 1850 Fine died, almost suddenly, from inflammation of the lungs, which she had caught by going one evening to wash the family linen in the Viorne, and carrying it home wet on her back. She returned soaked with water and perspiration, bowed down by her load, which was terribly heavy, and she never recovered. Her death filled Macquart with consternation. His most reliable source of income was gone. When, a few days later, he sold the caldron in which his wife had boiled her chestnuts, and the wooden horse which she used in reseating old chairs, he foully accused the Divinity of having robbed him of that strong strapping woman of whom he had often felt ashamed, but whose real worth he now appreciated. He now also fell upon the children’s earnings with greater avidity than ever. But, a month later, Gervaise, tired of his continual exactions, ran away with her two children and Lantier, whose mother was dead. The lovers took refuge in Paris. Antoine, overwhelmed, vented his rage against his daughter by expressing the hope that she might die in hospital like most of her kind. This abuse did not, however, improve the situation, which was decidedly becoming bad. Jean soon followed his sister’s example. He waited for pay-day to come round, and then contrived to receive the money himself. As he was leaving he told one of his friends, who repeated it to Antoine, that he would no longer keep his lazy father, and that if the latter should take it into his head to have him brought back by the gendarmes he would touch neither saw nor plane. On the morrow, when Antoine, having vainly sought him, found himself alone and penniless in the house where for twenty years he had been comfortably kept, he flew into the most frantic rage, kicked the furniture about, and yelled the vilest imprecations. Then he sank down exhausted, and began to drag himself about and moan like a convalescent. The fear of having to earn his bread made him positively ill. When Silvère came to see him, he complained, with tears, of his children’s ingratitude. Had he not always been a good father to them? Jean and Gervaise were monsters, who had made him an evil return for all he had done for them. Now they abandoned him because he was old, and they could not get anything more out of him!","Macquart was not discouraged. He told himself that he would be able to strangle the Rougons single-handed if he could ever get them into a corner. His fits of rage were made even worse by several successive accidents that forced him to resume work. At the beginning of 1850 Fine died, quite suddenly, from inflammation of the lungs, which she had caught by going one evening to wash the family’s laundry in the Viorne and carrying it home wet on her back; she arrived home soaked with water and perspiration, bent double by her load, which was enormously heavy, and she never recovered. Her death came as a shock to Macquart. His most reliable source of income was gone. When, a few days later, he sold the pot in which his wife had boiled her chestnuts and the trestle she used for reseating old chairs, he foully accused the Lord of having robbed him of that fine woman, of whom he had often felt ashamed but whose real worth he now appreciated. He fell on the children’s earnings more avidly than ever. But a month later Gervaise, tired of his continual demands, ran away with her two children and Lantier, whose mother was now dead.

This abuse did not, however, improve his situation, which was decidedly in decline. Jean soon followed his sister’s example. He waited for payday to come round and then contrived to be given his wages himself. As he was leaving, he told one of his friends, who then told Antoine, that he would no longer keep his lazy father, and that if the latter took it into his head to have him brought back by the gendarmes he would touch neither saw nor plane.

When Silvère came to see him, he complained tearfully of his children’s ingratitude. Had he not always been a good father to them?

"Derrière la masure de Macquart, il y avait une petite cour qu’une muraille séparait du terrain des Fouque. Un matin, les voisins furent très surpris en voyant cette muraille percée d’une porte, qui la veille au soir n’était pas là. En une heure, le faubourg entier défila aux fenêtres voisines. Les amants avaient dû travailler toute la nuit pour creuser l’ouverture et pour poser la porte. Maintenant, ils pouvaient aller librement de l’un chez l’autre. Le scandale recommença ; on fut moins doux pour Adélaïde, qui décidément était la honte du faubourg ; cette porte, cet aveu tranquille et brutal de vie commune lui fut plus violemment reproché que ses deux enfants. « On sauve au moins les apparences », disaient les femmes les plus tolérantes. Adélaïde ignorait ce qu’on appelle « sauver les apparences » ; elle était très heureuse, très fière de sa porte ; elle avait aidé Macquart à arracher les pierres du mur, elle lui avait même gâché du plâtre pour que la besogne allât plus vite ; aussi vint-elle, le lendemain, avec une joie d’enfant, regarder son œuvre, en plein jour, ce qui parut le comble du dévergondage à trois commères, qui l’aperçurent, contemplant la maçonnerie encore fraîche. Dès lors, à chaque apparition de Macquart, on pensa, en ne voyant plus la jeune femme, qu’elle allait vivre avec lui dans la masure de l’impasse Saint-Mittre.","Behind Macquart's hovel there was a little courtyard separated by a wall from the Fouques' land. One morning, the neighbors were very surprised to see this wall pierced with a door, which the night before was not there. In an hour the whole faubourg filed past the neighboring windows. The lovers had to work all night to dig the opening and to put the door. Now they could go freely from one to the other. The scandal began again; they were less kind to Adelaide, who was decidedly the shame of the faubourg; this door, this quiet and brutal admission of common life was more violently reproached to him than his two children. ""We at least save appearances,"" said the most tolerant women. Adelaide was unaware of what is called “keeping up appearances”; she was very happy, very proud of her door; she had helped Macquart to pull the stones out of the wall, she had even spoiled some plaster for him to make the job go more quickly; so she came the next day, with childish joy, to look at her work in broad daylight, which seemed the height of shamelessness to three gossips, who caught sight of her, contemplating the still fresh masonry. From then on, each time Macquart appeared, people thought, when they no longer saw the young woman, that she was going to live with him in the hovel in the impasse Saint-Mittre.","Behind Macquart’s hovel there was a little yard, separated from the Fouques’ property by a wall. One morning the neighbours were much astonished to find in this wall a door which had not been there the previous evening. Before an hour had elapsed, the entire Faubourg had flocked to the neighbouring windows. The lovers must have worked the whole night to pierce the opening and place the door there. They could now go freely from one house to the other. The scandal was revived, everyone felt less pity for Adélaïde, who was certainly the disgrace of the suburb; she was reproached more wrathfully for that door, that tacit, brutal admission of her union, than even for her two illegitimate children. “People should at least study appearances,” the most tolerant women would say. But Adélaïde did not understand what was meant by studying appearances. She was very happy, very proud of her door; she had assisted Macquart to knock the stones from the wall and had even mixed the mortar so that the work might proceed the quicker; and she came with childish delight to inspect the work by daylight on the morrow—an act which was deemed a climax of shamelessness by three gossips who observed her contemplating the masonry. From that date, whenever Macquart reappeared, it was thought, as no one then ever saw the young woman, that she was living with him in the hovel of the Impasse Saint-Mittre.","Behind Macquart’s shack was a little yard, separated from the Fouques’ property by a wall.

The scandal was given fresh life, and everyone felt less sympathy for Adélaïde, who had now become the disgrace of the neighbourhood; she was condemned even more for the door, a tacit, open admission of her relationship with Macquart, than for her two illegitimate children. ‘People should at least keep up appearances,’ the most tolerant women would say. But Adélaïde did not understand what was meant by ‘appearances’. She was happy, very proud of her door; she had helped Macquart to pull the stones from the wall and had even mixed the mortar so that the job could be finished more quickly; and in the morning she arrived like a delighted child to inspect the work by daylight — an act that was deemed supremely shameless by three gossips who watched her gazing at the fresh masonry. From that time onwards, whenever Macquart reappeared, it was thought — as no one then ever saw the young woman — that she was living with him in the shack in the Impasse Saint-Mittre."
"Ils s’embrassèrent encore, ils s’endormirent. Et, au plafond, la tache de lumière s’arrondissait comme un œil terrifié, ouvert et fixé longuement sur le sommeil de ces bourgeois blêmes, suant le crime dans les draps, et qui voyaient en rêve tomber dans leur chambre une pluie de sang, dont les gouttes larges se changeaient en pièces d’or sur le carreau.","They kissed again, they fell asleep. And, on the ceiling, the spot of light rounded out like a terrified eye, open and fixed for a long time on the sleep of these pale bourgeois, sweating crime in the sheets, and who saw in their dreams a rain of blood falling in their room, whose large drops changed into pieces of gold on the pane.","They again kissed each other and fell asleep. The patch of light on the ceiling now seemed to be assuming the shape of a terrified eye, that stared wildly and fixedly upon the pale, slumbering couple who reeked with crime beneath their very sheets, and dreamt they could see a rain of blood falling in big drops which turned into golden coins as they plashed upon the floor.","They kissed each other again and fell asleep.

"À chaque visite du jeune homme, les mêmes scènes se reproduisaient. Il arrivait, le soir, pendant le dîner de la famille Macquart. Le père avalait quelque ragoût de pommes de terre en grognant. Il triait les morceaux de lard, et suivait des yeux le plat, lorsqu’il passait aux mains de Jean et de Gervaise.","With each visit of the young man, the same scenes were reproduced. He arrived in the evening during dinner with the Macquart family. The father gulped down some potato stew with a grunt. He was sorting through the pieces of bacon, and followed the dish with his eyes as it passed into the hands of Jean and Gervaise.","The scene was much the same every time the young man called. He used to come in the evening, while the Macquarts were at dinner. The father would be swallowing some potato stew with a growl, picking out the pieces of bacon, and watching the dish when it passed into the hands of Jean and Gervaise.","The same scenario was repeated every time the young man called.

"Aristide, le plus jeune des fils Rougon, était opposé à Eugène, géométriquement pour ainsi dire. Il avait le visage de sa mère et des avidités, un caractère sournois, apte aux intrigues vulgaires, où les instincts de son père dominaient. La nature a souvent des besoins de symétrie. Petit, la mine chafouine, pareille à une pomme de canne curieusement taillée en tête de Polichinelle, Aristide furetait, fouillait partout, peu scrupuleux, pressé de jouir. Il aimait l’argent comme son frère aîné aimait le pouvoir. Tandis qu’Eugène rêvait de plier un peuple à sa volonté et s’enivrait de sa toute-puissance future, lui se voyait dix fois millionnaire, logé dans une demeure princière, mangeant et buvant bien, savourant la vie par tous les sens et tous les organes de son corps. Il voulait surtout une fortune rapide. Lorsqu’il bâtissait un château en Espagne, ce château s’élevait magiquement dans son esprit ; il avait des tonneaux d’or du soir au lendemain ; cela plaisait à ses paresses, d’autant plus qu’il ne s’inquiétait jamais des moyens, et que les plus prompts lui semblaient les meilleurs. La race des Rougon, de ces paysans épais et avides, aux appétits de brute, avait mûri trop vite ; tous les besoins de jouissance matérielle s’épanouissaient chez Aristide, triplés par une éducation hâtive, plus insatiables et dangereux depuis qu’ils devenaient raisonnés. Malgré ses délicates intuitions de femme, Félicité préférait ce garçon ; elle ne sentait pas combien Eugène lui appartenait davantage ; elle excusait les sottises et les paresses de son fils cadet, sous prétexte qu’il serait l’homme supérieur de la famille, et qu’un homme supérieur a le droit de mener une vie débraillée, jusqu’au jour où la puissance de ses facultés se révèle. Aristide mit rudement son indulgence à l’épreuve. À Paris, il mena une vie sale et oisive ; il fut un de ces étudiants qui prennent leurs inscriptions dans les brasseries du Quartier latin. D’ailleurs, il n’y resta que deux années ; son père, effrayé, voyant qu’il n’avait pas encore passé un seul examen, le retint à Plassans et parla de lui chercher une femme, espérant que les soucis du ménage en feraient un homme rangé. Aristide se laissa marier. À cette époque, il ne voyait pas clairement dans ses ambitions ; la vie de province ne lui déplaisait pas ; il se trouvait à l’engrais dans sa petite ville, mangeant, dormant, flânant. Félicité plaida sa cause avec tant de chaleur que Pierre consentit à nourrir et à loger le ménage, à la condition que le jeune homme s’occuperait activement de la maison de commerce. Dès lors commença pour ce dernier une belle existence de fainéantise ; il passa au cercle ses journées et la plus grande partie de ses nuits, s’échappant du bureau de son père comme un collégien, allant jouer les quelques louis que sa mère lui donnait en cachette. Il faut avoir vécu au fond d’un département, pour bien comprendre quelles furent les quatre années d’abrutissement que ce garçon passa de la sorte. Il y a ainsi, dans chaque petite ville, un groupe d’individus vivant aux crochets de leurs parents, feignant parfois de travailler, mais cultivant en réalité leur paresse avec une sorte de religion. Aristide fut le type de ces flâneurs incorrigibles que l’on voit se traîner voluptueusement dans le vide de la province. Il joua à l’écarté pendant quatre ans. Tandis qu’il vivait au cercle, sa femme, une blonde molle et placide, aidait à la ruine de la maison Rougon par un goût prononcé pour les toilettes voyantes et par un appétit formidable, très curieux chez une créature aussi frêle. Angèle adorait les rubans bleu ciel et le filet de bœuf rôti. Elle était fille d’un capitaine retraité, qu’on nommait le commandant Sicardot, bonhomme qui lui avait donné pour dot dix mille francs, toutes ses économies. Aussi Pierre, en choisissant Angèle pour son fils, avait-il pensé conclure une affaire inespérée, tant il estimait Aristide à bas prix. Cette dot de dix mille francs, qui le décida, devint justement par la suite un pavé attaché à son cou. Son fils était déjà un rusé fripon ; il lui remit les dix mille francs, en s’associant avec lui, ne voulant pas garder un sou, affichant le plus grand dévouement.","Aristide, the youngest of the Rougon sons, was opposed to Eugene, geometrically so to speak. He had his mother's face and greed, a sly character, apt for vulgar intrigues, where his father's instincts dominated. Nature often needs symmetry. Small, mischievous, like a cane apple curiously carved into Punchinello's head, Aristide ferreted about, rummaged everywhere, unscrupulous, in a hurry to enjoy. He loved money like his older brother loved power. While Eugene dreamed of bending a people to his will and was intoxicated by his future omnipotence, he saw himself ten times a millionaire, lodged in a princely residence, eating and drinking well, savoring life through all the senses and all the organs of his body. Above all, he wanted a quick fortune. When he built a castle in Spain, that castle rose magically in his mind; he had barrels of gold overnight; it pleased his laziness, the more so as he never worried about the means, and the quickest seemed to him the best. The race of the Rougons, of those thick and greedy peasants, with brute appetites, had matured too quickly; all the needs for material enjoyment flourished in Aristide, tripled by a hasty education, more insatiable and dangerous since they had become reasoned. Despite her delicate feminine intuitions, Felicite preferred this boy; she did not feel how much more Eugene belonged to her; she excused the foolishness and laziness of her youngest son, on the pretext that he would be the superior man in the family, and that a superior man has the right to lead a disheveled life, until the day when the power of his faculties is revealed. Aristide severely tested his indulgence. In Paris he led a dirty and idle life; he was one of those students who enroll in the brasseries of the Latin Quarter. Besides, he remained there only two years; his father, terrified, seeing that he had not yet passed a single examination, detained him at Plassans and spoke of finding him a wife, hoping that the cares of the household would make him an orderly man. Aristide allowed himself to be married. At that time, he did not see clearly in his ambitions; provincial life did not displease him; he found himself fat in his little town, eating, sleeping, strolling. Félicité pleaded her case with such warmth that Pierre consented to feed and lodge the household, on the condition that the young man would actively take care of the business house. From then on began for the latter a fine existence of laziness; he spent his days and most of his nights at the club, escaping from his father's office like a schoolboy, going to play the few louis that his mother secretly gave him. You have to have lived in the depths of a department to fully understand what were the four years of brutalization that this boy spent in this way. There is thus, in each small town, a group of individuals living off their parents, sometimes pretending to work, but in reality cultivating their laziness with a kind of religion. Aristide was the type of those incorrigible flâneurs whom one sees trailing voluptuously through the emptiness of the provinces. He played away for four years. While he was living in the club, his wife, a soft and placid blonde, contributed to the ruin of the Rougon house by a pronounced taste for showy clothes and by a formidable appetite, very curious in such a frail creature. Angèle adored the sky-blue ribbons and the roast beef tenderloin. She was the daughter of a retired captain, called the Commandant Sicardot, a good man who had given her as a dowry ten thousand francs, all his savings. So Pierre, in choosing Angèle for his son, had thought of concluding an unexpected deal, so low was his esteem for Aristide. This dowry of ten thousand francs, which decided him, became precisely afterwards a cobblestone attached to his neck. Her son was already a cunning rascal; he gave him the ten thousand francs, joining forces with him, not wanting to keep a penny, displaying the greatest devotion.","Aristide, the youngest son, was, so to speak, diametrically opposed to Eugène. He had his mother’s face, and a covetousness and slyness of character prone to trivial intrigues, in which his father’s instincts predominated. Nature has need of symmetry. Short, with a pitiful countenance suggesting the knob of a stick carved into a Punch’s head, Aristide ferretted and fumbled everywhere, without any scruples, eager only to gratify himself. He loved money as his eldest brother loved power. While Eugène dreamed of bending a people to his will, and intoxicated himself with visions of future omnipotence, the other fancied himself ten times a millionaire, installed in a princely mansion, eating and drinking to his heart’s content, and enjoying life to the fullest possible extent. Above all things, he longed to make a rapid fortune. When he was building his castles in the air, they would rise in his mind as if by magic; he would become possessed of tons of gold in one night. These visions agreed with his indolence, as he never troubled himself about the means, considering those the best which were the most expeditious. In his case the race of the Rougons, of those coarse, greedy peasants with brutish appetites, had matured too rapidly; every desire for material indulgence was found in him, augmented threefold by hasty education, and rendered the more insatiable and dangerous by the deliberate way in which the young man had come to regard their realisation as his set purpose. In spite of her keen feminine intuition, Félicité preferred this son; she did not perceive the greater affinity between herself and Eugène; she excused the follies and indolence of her youngest son under the pretext that he would some day be the superior genius of the family, and that such a man was entitled to live a disorderly life until his intellectual strength should be revealed. Aristide subjected her indulgence to a rude test. In Paris he led a low, idle life; he was one of those students who enter their names at the taverns of the Quartier Latin. He did not remain there, however, more than two years; his father, growing apprehensive, and seeing that he had not yet passed a single examination, kept him at Plassans and spoke of finding a wife for him, hoping that domestic responsibility would make him more steady. Aristide let himself be married. He had no very clear idea of his own ambitions at this time; provincial life did not displease him; he was battening in his little town—eating, sleeping, and sauntering about. Félicité pleaded his cause so earnestly that Pierre consented to board and lodge the newly-married couple, on condition that the young man should turn his attention to the business. From that time, however, Aristide led a life of ease and idleness. He spent his days and the best part of his nights at the club, again and again slipping out of his father’s office like a schoolboy to go and gamble away the few louis that his mother gave him clandestinely. It is necessary to have lived in the depths of the French provinces to form an idea of the four brutifying years which the young fellow spent in this fashion. In every little town there is a group of individuals who thus live on their parents, pretending at times to work, but in reality cultivating idleness with a sort of religious zeal. Aristide was typical of these incorrigible drones. For four years he did little but play écarté. While he passed his time at the club, his wife, a fair-complexioned nerveless woman, helped to ruin the Rougon business by her inordinate passion for showy gowns and her formidable appetite, a rather remarkable peculiarity in so frail a creature. Angèle, however, adored sky-blue ribbons and roast beef. She was the daughter of a retired captain who was called Commander Sicardot, a good-hearted old gentleman, who had given her a dowry of ten thousand francs—all his savings. Pierre, in selecting Angèle for his son had considered that he had made an unexpected bargain, so lightly did he esteem Aristide. However, that dowry of ten thousand francs, which determined his choice, ultimately became a millstone round his neck. His son, who was already a cunning rogue, deposited the ten thousand francs with his father, with whom he entered into partnership, declining, with the most sincere professions of devotion, to keep a single copper.","Aristide, the youngest of the Rougon sons, was, so to speak, the diametrical opposite of Eugène. He had his mother’s face, and a covetousness and slyness of character, with a taste for petty intrigue, in which his father’s instincts predominated. Nature needs symmetry. Short, with an unfortunate face like the knob of a stick carved in the shape of a Punch’s head, Aristide scurried everywhere like a ferret, entirely without scruples, eager only to satisfy his own desires. He loved money as his eldest brother loved power. While Eugène dreamed of bending people to his will, and intoxicated himself with visions of omnipotence, his brother fancied himself a millionaire ten times over, living in a princely mansion, eating fine food and drinking fine wines, and enjoying life through all his senses and every organ in his body. Above all, he wanted to become rich as fast as possible. When he was building his castles in the air, they would rise up as if by magic; he would acquire mountains of gold overnight. These visions suited his indolence, for he never worried about the means, always considering the most expeditious to be the best. In his case the race of the Rougons, those coarse, greedy peasants with brutish appetites, had matured too quickly; he embodied every desire for material gratification, augmented threefold by a rapid education, and rendered the more insatiable and dangerous by the fact that he regarded their realization as his main goal in life. In spite of her sharp feminine intuition, he was Félicité’s favourite son; she did not realize how much she had in common with Eugène; she excused the follies and indolence of her youngest son under the pretext that one day he would be the pre-eminent member of the family, and that such a man was entitled to live a disorderly life until his superior talents were revealed. Aristide tested her indulgence to the limit. In Paris he led a life of idleness and dissipation; he was one of those students who enrol in the cafés of the Latin Quarter. He stayed there, however, for only two years; his father, growing increasingly worried, and seeing that he had not yet sat a single exam, called him back to Plassans and spoke of finding a wife for him, hoping that domestic responsibility would make him settle down. Aristide allowed himself to be married. He had no clear idea of his own ambitions at this time; he did not dislike provincial life; he was fattening himself up in his little town— eating, sleeping, and sauntering about. Félicité pleaded his cause so earnestly that Pierre consented to board and lodge the newly married couple, on condition that the young man became involved in the family business. From that time, however, Aristide began a new life of ease and idleness. He spent his days and the best part of his nights with his friends, slipping out of his father’s office like a schoolboy to go and gamble away the few louis that his mother gave him in secret. You have to live in the depths of the French provinces to understand the four stultifying years which the young Artistide spent in this fashion. In every little town there is a group of individuals who live like this on their parents, pretending at times to work but in reality cultivating idleness with a kind of religious zeal. Aristide was typical of these incorrigible flâneurs* to be seen drifting about self-indulgently in the emptiness of the provinces. For four years he did little but play cards. While he spent his time with his friends, his wife, an insipid, fair-haired woman, helped to ruin the Rougon business with her passion for showy gowns and her prodigious appetite, a rather remarkable characteristic in so frail a creature. Angèle adored sky-blue ribbons and pink roast beef. She was the daughter of a retired army captain known as Commander Sicardot, an affable old gentleman who had given her a dowry of ten thousand francs — his life’s savings. Pierre, in choosing Angèle for his son, had thought that he was making an unexpected bargain, in such low esteem did he hold Aristide. However, the dowry of ten thousand francs, which determined his choice, ultimately became a millstone round his neck. His son, who was already a cunning devil, returned the ten thousand francs to his father, with whom he entered into partnership, declining, with the most emphatic professions of good faith, to keep a single sou."
"Elle se mit à rire, elle aussi, en baissant les yeux sur ses bras. Puis ils ne se dirent plus rien. Ils demeurèrent encore un bon moment, à se regarder et à sourire. Comme Silvère semblait n’avoir plus de questions à lui adresser, Miette s’en alla tout simplement et se remit à arracher les mauvaises herbes, sans lever la tête. Lui, resta un instant sur le mur. Le soleil se couchait ; une nappe de rayons obliques coulait sur les terres jaunes du Jas-Meiffren ; les terres flambaient, on eût dit un incendie courant au ras du sol. Et, dans cette nappe flambante, Silvère regardait la petite paysanne accroupie et dont les bras nus avaient repris leur jeu rapide ; la jupe de cotonnade bleue blanchissait, des lueurs couraient le long des bras cuivrés. Il finit par éprouver une sorte de honte à rester là. Il descendit du mur.","She laughed too, looking down at her arms. Then they said nothing more. They stayed a while longer, looking at each other and smiling. As Silvere seemed to have no more questions for him, Miette simply left and resumed pulling the weeds, without raising her head. He stayed on the wall for a moment. The sun was setting ; a sheet of oblique rays flowed over the yellow soils of Jas-Meiffren; the land was blazing, one would have said it was a fire running along the ground. And, in this flaming tablecloth, Silvere watched the little peasant girl squatting down and whose bare arms had resumed their rapid play; the blue cotton skirt was whitening, gleams ran along the copper arms. He ends up feeling a kind of shame to stay there. He climbed down from the wall.","She also began to laugh, as she lowered her eyes to her arms. Then they ceased speaking. They remained for another moment gazing and smiling at each other. And finally, as Silvère seemingly had no more questions to ask her, Miette quietly withdrew and went on plucking her weeds, without raising her head. The lad for his part remained on the wall for a while. The sun was setting; a stream of oblique rays poured over the yellow soil of the Jas-Meiffren, which seemed to be all ablaze—one would have said that a fire was running along the ground—and, in the midst of the flaming expanse, Silvère saw the little stooping peasant-girl, whose bare arms had resumed their rapid motion. The blue cotton skirt was now becoming white; and rays of light streamed over the child’s copper-coloured arms. At last Silvère felt somewhat ashamed of remaining there, and accordingly got off the wall.","She began to laugh, and looked down at her arms. They said no more but remained there for a few moments, gazing at each other, smiling. Finally, as Silvère seemed to have no more questions, Miette quietly withdrew and carried on with her weeding, without looking up. He remained on the wall for a while. The sun was setting, its slanting rays pouring over the yellow soil of the Jas-Meiffren, which seemed to be on fire. It was as if flames were running along the ground; and, in the midst of this expanse, Silvère watched the little peasant girl as she bent over, her bare arms moving as fast as before. The blue cotton skirt was becoming white, and rays of light were streaming over the child’s copper-coloured arms. At last Silvère began to feel almost ashamed at remaining there, and got off the wall."
"Cependant, au milieu du cours, La Palud et Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx, s’étant reformés, se tenaient farouches et debout. Un bûcheron, un géant dont la tête dépassait celle de ses compagnons, criait, en agitant sa cravate rouge : « À nous, Chavanoz, Graille, Poujols, Saint-Eutrope ! à nous, les Tulettes ! à nous, Plassans ! »","However, in the middle of the course, La Palud and Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx, having reformed, stood fierce and upright. A lumberjack, a giant whose head was higher than that of his companions, was shouting, waving his red tie: ""To us, Chavanoz, Graille, Poujols, Saint-Eutrope!"" to us, the Tulettes! to us, Plassans! »","Nevertheless, the contingents of La Palud and Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx had again formed in line in the middle of the promenade, and stood there erect and fierce. A wood-cutter, who was a head taller than any of his companions, shouted, as he waved his red neckerchief: “To arms, Chavanoz, Graille, Poujols, Saint-Eutrope! To arms, Les Tulettes!

"– Oh ! non, s’écria vivement la jeune fille. Un homme doit être fort. C’est beau, le courage !… Il faut me pardonner d’être jalouse. Je voudrais bien être aussi forte que toi. Tu m’aimerais encore davantage, n’est-ce pas ? »","- Oh ! no, exclaimed the young girl hastily. A man must be strong. It's beautiful, courage!... You must forgive me for being jealous. I would like to be as strong as you. You would love me even more, wouldn't you? »","“Oh, no!” cried the girl eagerly. “A man should be brave! Courage is beautiful! You must forgive my jealousy. I should like to be as strong-minded as you are. You would love me all the more, wouldn’t you?”","‘Oh no!’ she cried. ‘A man must be brave. Courage is a wonderful thing!... You must forgive me for being jealous. I would like to be as strong as you. You would love me all the more, wouldn’t you?’"
Alors Macquart cria d’une voix forte :,Then Macquart cried out in a loud voice:,"Both leaves of it swung back slowly, and the porch then lay open and empty before them, while Macquart shouted in a loud voice: “Come on, my friends!”",Macquart shouted loudly:
"« Le marquis, continua Félicité, croit que le prince Louis a succombé ; nous sommes ruinés, nous n’aurons jamais un sou. »","“The marquis,” continued Felicite, “believes that Prince Louis has succumbed; we are ruined, we will never have a penny. »","“The marquis,” continued Félicité, “thinks that Prince Louis has succumbed. We are ruined; we shall never get a sou.”","‘The Marquis’, continued Félicité , ‘thinks that Prince Louis has lost; we are ruined, we’ll never get a sou.’"
"« Laisse-les dire, va. Si nous redevenons les plus forts, ils verront de quel bois je me chauffe. Je sais d’où vient le coup. La ville neuve nous en veut. »","“Let them say, go. If we become the strongest again, they'll see what I'm talking about. I know where the blow is coming from. The new town is angry with us. »","“Let them talk,” she answered. “If we get the upper hand again they shall see what stuff I’m made of. I know where the blow comes from. The new town hates us.”","‘Let them talk,’ she replied. ‘If we get the upper hand again they’ll see what I’m made of. I know where it’s all coming from. The new town hates us.’"
"– Oui, oui, trois coups de feu, reprit l’ancien bonnetier. C’est le charcutier Dubruel, M. Liévin et M. Massicot qui ont déchargé leurs armes avec une vivacité coupable. »","“Yes, yes, three shots,” resumed the former hosier. It was the butcher Dubruel, Mr. Liévin and Mr. Massicot who discharged their weapons with culpable vivacity. »","“Yes, yes, three shots,” resumed the old hosier. “The pork-butcher Dubruel, Monsieur Lievin, and Monsieur Massicot discharged their guns with really culpable alacrity.”","‘Yes, yes, three shots,’ resumed the former hosier. ‘ The pork butcher Dubruel, Monsieur Liévin, and Monsieur Massicot opened fire with quite indecent haste.’"
"Le comte, dès les premiers troubles, était parti pour son château de Corbière. Il n’y avait à l’hôtel que le marquis de Carnavant. Depuis la veille, il s’était prudemment tenu à l’écart, non pas qu’il eût peur, mais parce qu’il lui répugnait d’être vu, tripotant avec les Rougon, à l’heure décisive. Au fond, la curiosité le brûlait ; il avait dû s’enfermer, pour ne pas courir se donner l’étonnant spectacle des intrigues du salon jaune. Quand un valet de chambre vint lui dire, au milieu de la nuit, qu’il y avait en bas des messieurs qui le demandaient, il ne put rester sage plus longtemps, il se leva et descendit en toute hâte.","The count, from the first disturbances, had left for his castle of Corbière. There was only the Marquis de Carnavant at the hotel. Since the day before he had prudently kept away, not because he was afraid, but because he hated to be seen fiddling with the Rougons at the decisive hour. Deep down, curiosity burned him; he must have shut himself up so as not to rush off to give himself the astonishing spectacle of the intrigues of the yellow drawing-room. When a valet came to tell him, in the middle of the night, that there were gentlemen downstairs who wanted him, he could not remain quiet any longer, he got up and went downstairs in haste.","At the very outset of the disturbances Count de Valqueyras had left for his chateau at Corbière. There was no one but the Marquis de Carnavant at the Plassans house. He, since the previous evening, had prudently kept aloof; not that he was afraid, but because he did not care to be seen plotting with the Rougons at the critical moment. As a matter of fact, he was burning with curiosity. He had been compelled to shut himself up in order to resist the temptation of hastening to the yellow drawing-room. When the footman came to tell him, in the middle of the night, that there were some gentlemen below asking for him, he could not hold back any longer. He got up and went downstairs in all haste.","At the very first sign of trouble Count de Valqueyras had left for his chateau at Corbière.

"Ce qui fit surtout de lui un républicain féroce, ce fut l’espérance de se venger enfin des Rougon, qui se rangeaient franchement du côté de la réaction. Ah ! quel triomphe ! s’il pouvait un jour tenir Pierre et Félicité à sa merci ! Bien que ces derniers eussent fait d’assez mauvaises affaires, ils étaient devenus des bourgeois, et lui, Macquart, était resté ouvrier. Cela l’exaspérait. Chose plus mortifiante peut-être, ils avaient un de leurs fils avocat, un autre médecin, le troisième employé, tandis que son Jean travaillait chez un menuisier, et sa Gervaise, chez une blanchisseuse. Quand il comparait les Macquart aux Rougon, il éprouvait encore une grande honte à voir sa femme vendre des châtaignes à la halle et rempailler, le soir, les vieilles chaises graisseuses du quartier. Cependant, Pierre était son frère, il n’avait pas plus droit que lui à vivre grassement de ses rentes. Et, d’ailleurs, c’était avec l’argent qu’il lui avait volé, qu’il jouait au monsieur aujourd’hui. Dès qu’il entamait ce sujet, tout son être entrait en rage ; il clabaudait pendant des heures, répétant ses anciennes accusations à satiété, ne se lassant pas de dire :","What made him above all a ferocious republican was the hope of finally taking revenge on the Rougons, who were frankly on the side of reaction. Ah! what a triumph! if only he could one day hold Pierre and Félicité at his mercy! Although the latter had done rather bad business, they had become bourgeois, and he, Macquart, had remained a worker. This infuriated him. More mortifying perhaps, they had one of their lawyer sons, another doctor, the third employee, while his Jean worked for a carpenter, and his Gervaise, for a laundress. When he compared the Macquarts to the Rougons, he was still very ashamed to see his wife selling chestnuts in the market and, in the evenings, repacking the greasy old chairs in the neighborhood. However, Pierre was his brother, he had no more right than him to live generously on his income. And, besides, it was with the money he had stolen from her, that he was playing the gentleman today. As soon as he broached this subject, his whole being flew into a rage; he chattered away for hours, repeating his old accusations over and over again, never tiring of saying:","That which chiefly converted him into a fierce Republican was the hope of at last being able to revenge himself on the Rougons, who had openly ranged themselves on the side of the reactionary party. Ah, what a triumph if he could only hold Pierre and Félicité at his mercy!

Perhaps he was still more mortified because one of their sons was a barrister, another a doctor, and the third a clerk, while his son Jean merely worked at a carpenter’s shop, and his daughter Gervaise at a washerwoman’s. When he compared the Macquarts with the Rougons, he was still more ashamed to see his wife selling chestnuts in the market, and mending the greasy old straw-seated chairs of the neighbourhood in the evening.

"Et elle se tourna vers la ruelle, pour ne plus voir les gens dont elle parlait. Au bout d’un silence :","And she turned towards the alley, so as not to see the people she was talking about.

"Alors il voulut sauter du talus pour aller rejoindre ses compagnons ; mais, à ce moment, les insurgés s’arrêtèrent. Des ordres coururent le long de la colonne.

Silvère, qui écoutait, put comprendre les ordres que les contingents se transmettaient, et qui appelaient les gens de Plassans en tête de la bande. Comme chaque bataillon se rangeait au bord de la route pour laisser passer le drapeau, le jeune homme, entraînant Miette, se mit à remonter le talus.","Then he wanted to jump from the embankment to join his companions; but at this moment the insurgents stopped.

– Sans doute ! interrompit le marquis de sa voix flûtée. On m’a dit que les insurgés arrêtaient les personnes connues pour leurs opinions conservatrices. »,- Without a doubt ! interrupted the marquis in his piping voice.

"Devant eux, la route de Nice montait le versant opposé de la vallée ; mais ils ne pouvaient en voir qu’un bout assez court, car elle fait un coude brusque, à un demi-kilomètre du pont, et se perd entre des coteaux boisés. En se retournant, ils aperçurent l’autre bout de la route, celui qu’ils venaient de parcourir, et qui va en ligne droite de Plassans à la Viorne. Sous ce beau clair de lune d’hiver, on eût dit un long ruban d’argent que les rangées d’ormes bordaient de deux lisérés sombres. À droite et à gauche, les terres labourées de la côte faisaient de larges mers grises et vagues, coupées par ce ruban, par cette route blanche de gelée, d’un éclat métallique. Tout en haut, brillaient, au ras de l’horizon, pareilles à des étincelles vives, quelques fenêtres encore éclairées du faubourg. Miette et Silvère, pas à pas, s’étaient éloignés d’une grande lieue. Ils jetèrent un regard sur le chemin parcouru, frappés d’une muette admiration par cet immense amphithéâtre qui montait jusqu’au bord du ciel, et sur lequel des nappes de clartés bleuâtres coulaient comme sur les degrés d’une cascade géante. Ce décor étrange, cette apothéose colossale se dressait dans une immobilité et dans un silence de mort. Rien n’était d’une plus souveraine grandeur.","Ahead of them the road to Nice climbed the opposite side of the valley; but they could only see a fairly short end of it, for it makes a sharp bend, half a kilometer from the bridge, and disappears between wooded hillsides. Turning round, they perceived the other end of the road, the one they had just traversed, and which goes in a straight line from Plassans to Viorne. Under this beautiful winter moonlight, it looked like a long ribbon of silver bordered by the rows of elms with two dark borders. To right and left, the plowed lands of the coast made wide gray and vague seas, cut by this ribbon, by this road white with frost, with a metallic luster. At the very top shone, level with the horizon, like bright sparks, a few windows of the faubourg still lighted up. Miette and Silvere, step by step, had gone a great league away. They cast a glance at the path they had traveled, struck with mute admiration by this immense amphitheater which rose to the edge of the sky, and over which sheets of bluish light flowed as on the steps of a giant waterfall. This strange decor, this colossal apotheosis stood in dead stillness and silence. Nothing was of more sovereign grandeur.","The road to Nice ran up in front of them, along the opposite slope of the valley. But they could only see a small portion of it, as it takes a sudden turn about half a mile from the bridge, and is lost to view among the wooded hills. On looking round they caught sight of the other end of the road, that which they had just traversed, and which leads in a direct line from Plassans to the Viorne. In the beautiful winter moonlight it looked like a long silver ribbon, with dark edgings traced by the rows of elms. On the right and left the ploughed hill-land showed like vast, grey, vague seas intersected by this ribbon, this roadway white with frost, and brilliant as with metallic lustre. Up above, on a level with the horizon, lights shone from a few windows in the Faubourg, resembling glowing sparks. By degrees Miette and Silvère had walked fully a league. They gazed at the intervening road, full of silent admiration for the vast amphitheatre which rose to the verge of the heavens, and over which flowed bluish streams of light, as over the superposed rocks of a gigantic waterfall. The strange and colossal picture spread out amid deathlike stillness and silence. Nothing could have been of more sovereign grandeur.","In front of them the Nice road ran up the opposite side of the valley; but they could see only a small part of it, since it takes a sudden turn about half-a-kilometre from the bridge, and is lost to view among the wooded hills.

"« Petite, disait-il souvent en tapotant les joues de Félicité, si jamais Henri V me rend une fortune, je te ferai mon héritière. »","“Child,” he often said, patting Félicité on the cheeks, “if ever Henry V gives me back a fortune, I will make you my heiress. »","“Little one,” he would often say to Félicité, as he patted her on the cheek, “if ever Henri V. gives me a fortune, I will make you my heiress!”","‘My dear child,’ he would often say to Félicité, patting her on the cheek, ‘if Henri V ever gives me a fortune, I’ll leave it to you.’"
"L’armée insurrectionnelle aurait évité de traverser Plassans, si les chefs n’avaient jugé qu’un peu de nourriture et quelques heures de repos étaient pour leurs hommes d’une absolue nécessité. Au lieu de se porter directement sur le chef-lieu, la colonne, par une inexpérience et une faiblesse inexcusables du général improvisé qui la commandait, accomplissait alors une conversion à gauche, une sorte de large détour qui devait la mener à sa perte. Elle se dirigeait vers les plateaux de Sainte-Roure, éloignés encore d’une dizaine de lieues, et c’était la perspective de cette longue marche qui l’avait décidée à pénétrer dans la ville, malgré l’heure avancée. Il pouvait être alors onze heures et demie.","The insurrectionary army would have avoided crossing Plassans, if the chiefs had judged that a little food and a few hours of rest were for their men an absolute necessity. Instead of advancing directly on the chief town, the column, through the inexcusable inexcusability and inexcusable weakness of the improvised general who commanded it, then accomplished a conversion to the left, a sort of wide detour which was to lead to its ruin.

It might have been half-past eleven then.","The insurrectionary army would have avoided marching through Plassans if its leaders had not decided that a little food and a few hours’ rest were absolutely necessary for the men.

It was bound for the heights of Sainte-Roure, still about ten leagues distant, and it was in view of this long march that it had been decided to pass through Plassans, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour.

"– Ce qu’ils comptent en faire ! répondait Macquart avec un petit rire sec, mais ils les fusilleront dans les basses fosses des prisons. »","- What they intend to do with it! replied Macquart with a dry little laugh, ""but they will shoot them in the low pits of the prisons."" »","Why, they will shoot them in the lowest dungeons of the prison, of course,” replied Macquart, with a hoarse laugh.","They’ll shoot them in the deepest dungeons of the prison, of course,’ replied Macquart, with a hollow laugh."

"Quand Félicité fut descendue, elle resta un instant sur la place pour voir sortir Macquart. Il passa tranquillement devant le poste, en se mouchant. D’un coup de poing, dans le cabinet, il avait cassé la vitre du plafond, pour faire croire qu’il s’était sauvé par là.","When Felicite got out, she stood in the square for a moment to watch Macquart come out.

"Rougon, quand il se confessa à Félicité, ne put jamais dire combien de temps avait duré son supplice.

"Quand les deux femmes avaient pris leur aiguille et se tuaient les yeux à lui raccommoder ses vieilles chemises, Macquart, assis sur le meilleur siège, se renversait voluptueusement, sirotant et fumant, en homme qui savoure sa fainéantise. C’était l’heure où le vieux coquin accusait les riches de boire la sueur du peuple. Il avait des emportements superbes contre ces messieurs de la ville neuve, qui vivaient dans la paresse et se faisaient entretenir par le pauvre monde. Les lambeaux d’idées communistes qu’il avait pris le matin dans les journaux devenaient grotesques et monstrueux en passant par sa bouche. Il parlait d’une époque prochaine où personne ne serait plus obligé de travailler. Mais il gardait pour les Rougon ses haines les plus féroces. Il n’arrivait pas à digérer les pommes de terre qu’il avait mangées.","When the two women had taken up their needles and were killing their eyes mending his old shirts, Macquart, seated on the best seat, leaned back voluptuously, sipping and smoking, like a man savoring his laziness. It was the hour when the old rascal accused the rich of drinking the sweat of the people. He had superb outbursts against these gentlemen of the new town, who lived in laziness and were supported by poor people. The shreds of communist ideas he had picked up in the morning from the newspapers became grotesque and monstrous as they passed through his mouth. He was talking about a coming time when no one would be forced to work. But he retained his fiercest hatred for the Rougons. He couldn't digest the potatoes he ate.","When the two women had taken up their needles, and were ruining their eyesight in order to mend his old shirts, Macquart, taking the best seat, would throw himself back with an air of delicious comfort, and sip and smoke like a man who relishes his laziness. This was the time when the old rogue generally railed against the wealthy for living on the sweat of the poor man’s brow. He was superbly indignant with the gentlemen of the new town, who lived so idly, and compelled the poor to keep them in luxury. The fragments of communistic notions which he culled from the newspapers in the morning became grotesque and monstrous on falling from his lips. He would talk of a time near at hand when no one would be obliged to work. He always, however, kept his fiercest animosity for the Rougons. He never could digest the potatoes he had eaten.","When the two women had picked up their needles, and were ruining their eyesight mending his old shirts, Macquart, installed in the most comfortable chair, would sprawl back and drink and smoke like a man who relishes his laziness.

He fulminated at the gentlemen from the new town, who lived in such idleness, and forced the poor to keep them in luxury.

"« Vous avez peut-être raison, mes amis, leur avait-il dit avec son sourire d’indifférent affectueux ; battez-vous, je suis là pour vous raccommoder les bras et les jambes. »","""You may be right, my friends,"" he had told them, with his smile of affectionate indifference; fight, I'm here to mend your arms and legs. »","At first he had striven to dissuade them from the struggle; and then, as if convinced by their arguments, he had said to them with his kindly smile: “ Well, perhaps you are right, my friends; fight if you like, I shall be here to patch up your arms and legs.”","At first he had tried to dissuade them from taking up arms; and then, as if convinced by their arguments, he had said with his kindly smile: ‘Perhaps you’re right, my friends; fight if you like, I’ll be here to patch up your arms and legs.’"
"Ces bains de pieds firent naître dans l’esprit de Miette un caprice qui faillit gâter leurs belles amours innocentes. Elle voulut à toute force prendre de grands bains. Un peu en dessus du pont de la Viorne, il y avait un trou, très convenable, disait-elle, à peine profond de trois à quatre pieds, et très sûr ; il faisait si chaud, on serait si bien dans l’eau jusqu’aux épaules ; puis elle mourait depuis si longtemps du désir de savoir nager, Silvère lui apprendrait. Silvère élevait des objections : la nuit, ce n’était pas prudent, on pouvait les voir, ça leur ferait peut-être du mal ; mais il ne disait pas la vraie raison, il était instinctivement très alarmé à la pensée de ce nouveau jeu, il se demandait comment ils se déshabilleraient, et de quelle façon il s’y prendrait pour tenir Miette sur l’eau, dans ses bras nus. Celle-ci ne semblait pas se douter de ces difficultés.","These footbaths gave birth to a whim in Miette's mind which nearly spoiled their beautiful, innocent loves. She desperately wanted to take deep baths. A little above the Pont de la Viorne there was a hole, very suitable, she said, barely three or four feet deep, and very safe; it was so hot, we would feel so good in the water up to our shoulders; then she had been dying for so long of the desire to know how to swim, Silvere would teach her. Silvere raised objections: at night it was not prudent, you could see them, it might do them harm; but he didn't say the real reason, he was instinctively very alarmed at the thought of this new game, he wondered how they would undress, and how he would go about holding Miette in the water, in his arms naked. She did not seem to suspect these difficulties.","These footbaths suggested a dangerous idea to Miette. Nothing would satisfy her but a complete bath. A little above the bridge over the Viorne there was a very convenient spot, she said, barely three or four feet deep and quite safe; the weather was so warm, it would be so nice to have the water up to their necks; besides which, she had been dying to learn to swim for such a long time, and Silvère would be able to teach her. Silvère raised objections; it was not prudent at night time; they might be seen; perhaps, too they might catch cold. However, nothing could turn Miette from her purpose.","These footbaths suggested to Miette an idea that nearly spoilt their innocent young love. Nothing would satisfy her but to bathe properly.

Silvère raised objections: it was not prudent at night-time, they might be seen, perhaps they might catch cold; but he did not tell her the real reason for his objection, that he was instinctively most alarmed at the thought of this new escapade, and that he wondered how they would get undressed and how he would hold Miette in the water, in his bare arms. Miette seemed not to understand the reasons for his hesitation."
"Au commencement de l’année 1848, à la veille de la révolution de février, les trois fils Rougon avaient à Plassans des positions fort précaires. Ils offraient alors des types curieux, profondément dissemblables, bien que parallèlement issus de la même souche. Ils valaient mieux en somme que leurs parents. La race des Rougon devait s’épurer par les femmes. Adélaïde avait fait de Pierre un esprit moyen, apte aux ambitions basses ; Félicité venait de donner à ses fils des intelligences plus hautes, capables de grands vices et de grandes vertus.","At the beginning of the year 1848, on the eve of the February revolution, the three Rougon sons had very precarious positions at Plassans. They then offered curious types, profoundly dissimilar, although at the same time coming from the same stock. In short, they were better than their parents. The Rougon race had to be purified by women. Adelaide had made Pierre an average mind, fit for base ambitions; Felicite had just given her sons higher intelligences, capable of great vices and great virtues.","At the beginning of the year 1848, on the eve of the Revolution of February, the three young Rougons held very precarious positions at Plassans.

The race of the Rougons was destined to become refined through its female side. Adélaïde had made Pierre a man of moderate enterprise, disposed to low ambitions; Félicité had inspired her sons with a higher intelligence, with a capacity for greater vices and greater virtues.","At the beginning of 1848, on the eve of the February Revolution, the three Rougon sons held very precarious positions in Plassans.

"La bande descendait avec un élan superbe, irrésistible. Rien de plus terriblement grandiose que l’irruption de ces quelques milliers d’hommes dans la paix morte et glacée de l’horizon. La route, devenue torrent, roulait des flots vivants qui semblaient ne pas devoir s’épuiser ; toujours, au coude du chemin, se montraient de nouvelles masses noires, dont les chants enflaient de plus en plus la grande voix de cette tempête humaine. Quand les derniers bataillons apparurent, il y eut un éclat assourdissant. La Marseillaise emplit le ciel, comme soufflée par des bouches géantes dans de monstrueuses trompettes qui la jetaient, vibrante, avec des sécheresses de cuivre, à tous les coins de la vallée. Et la campagne endormie s’éveilla en sursaut ; elle frissonna tout entière, ainsi qu’un tambour que frappent les baguettes ; elle retentit jusqu’aux entrailles, répétant par tous ses échos les notes ardentes du chant national. Alors ce ne fut plus seulement la bande qui chanta ; des bouts de l’horizon, des rochers lointains, des pièces de terre labourées, des prairies, des bouquets d’arbres, des moindres broussailles, semblèrent sortir des voix humaines ; le large amphithéâtre qui monte de la rivière à Plassans, la cascade gigantesque sur laquelle coulaient les bleuâtres clartés de la lune, étaient comme couverts par un peuple invisible et innombrable acclamant les insurgés ; et, au fond des creux de la Viorne, le long des eaux rayées de mystérieux reflets d’étain fondu, il n’y avait pas un trou de ténèbres où des hommes cachés ne parussent reprendre chaque refrain avec une colère plus haute. La campagne, dans l’ébranlement de l’air et du sol, criait vengeance et liberté. Tant que la petite armée descendit la côte, le rugissement populaire roula ainsi par ondes sonores traversées de brusques éclats, secouant jusqu’aux pierres du chemin.","The band descended with a superb, irresistible momentum. Nothing is more terribly grandiose than the irruption of these few thousand men into the dead and icy peace of the horizon. The road, which had become a torrent, rolled in living waves which seemed bound to never run out; always, at the bend of the road, appeared new black masses, whose songs swelled more and more the great voice of this human tempest. When the last battalions appeared, there was a deafening roar. The Marseillaise fills the sky, as if blown by giant mouths in monstrous trumpets which threw it, vibrating, with copper dryness, to all the corners of the valley. And the sleeping countryside awoke with a start; she shuddered all over, like a drum struck by sticks; it resounds to the entrails, repeating by all its echoes the ardent notes of the national song. So it was no longer just the band that sang; bits of the horizon, distant rocks, patches of plowed land, meadows, clumps of trees, the least brushwood, seemed to issue from human voices; the large amphitheater which rises from the river at Plassans, the gigantic waterfall over which flowed the bluish light of the moon, were as if covered by an invisible and innumerable people cheering the insurgents; and, deep in the hollows of the Viorne, along the waters streaked with mysterious reflections of molten pewter, there was not a hole of darkness where hidden men did not seem to take up each refrain with loftier anger. The countryside, in the shock of the air and the ground, cried out for vengeance and freedom. As long as the little army descended the hill, the popular roar rolled thus in sound waves traversed by sudden bursts, shaking even the stones of the road.","The band descended the slope with a superb, irresistible stride. There could have been nothing grander than the irruption of those few thousand men into that cold, still, deathly scene. The highway became a torrent, rolling with living waves which seemed inexhaustible. At the bend in the road fresh masses ever appeared, whose songs ever helped to swell the roar of this human tempest. When the last battalions came in sight the uproar was deafening. The “Marseillaise” filled the atmosphere as if blown through enormous trumpets by giant mouths, which cast it, vibrating with a brazen clang, into every corner of the valley. The slumbering country-side awoke with a start—quivering like a beaten drum resonant to its very entrails, and repeating with each and every echo the passionate notes of the national song. And then the singing was no longer confined to the men. From the very horizon, from the distant rocks, the ploughed land, the meadows, the copses, the smallest bits of brushwood, human voices seemed to come. The great amphitheatre, extending from the river to Plassans, the gigantic cascade over which the bluish moonlight flowed, was as if filled with innumerable invisible people cheering the insurgents; and in the depths of the Viorne, along the waters streaked with mysterious metallic reflections, there was not a dark nook but seemed to conceal human beings, who took up each refrain with yet greater passion. With air and earth alike quivering, the whole country-side cried for vengeance and liberty. So long as the little army was descending the slope, the roar of the populace thus rolled on in sonorous waves broken by abrupt outbursts which shook the very stones in the roadway.","The crowd descended the slope in one long, marvellous, irresistible rush. There could have been no more majestic sight than the irruption of these few thousand men into that cold, still landscape. The road became a torrent, rolling with living waves that seemed never to end; again and again, yet more dark throngs came round the bend, their singing continually swelling the great voice of this human tempest. When the last battalions came into sight, the noise was deafening. The Marseillaise filled the air, as if blown through huge trumpets by giant mouths and projected by the vibrating brass into every corner of the valley. The sleeping countryside awoke with a start, quivering like a beaten drum; it resounded in its very depths, repeating with each echo the stirring notes of the national anthem. Then the singing seemed to come from everywhere. From the horizon, from the distant rocks, the ploughed land, the fields, the copses, the smallest bits of brushwood, human voices seemed to be rising up. The great amphitheatre, stretching up from the river to Plassans, the gigantic torrent over which the bluish moonlight flowed, seemed filled with a huge, invisible crowd cheering on the insurgents; and in the depths of the Viorne, along the water streaked with mysterious metallic reflections, every dark spot seemed to conceal people taking up the refrain with increasing passion. The air and earth seemed alive; it was as if the whole countryside was crying out for vengeance and liberty. As the little army descended the slope, the roar rolled on in sonorous waves broken only by sudden outbursts which shook the very stones in their path."
"Alors Macquart, voyant qu’il allait être payé, se mit à geindre. Il avait compris trop tard les conséquences de sa trahison ; sans cela, il aurait exigé une somme deux et trois fois plus forte. Et il se plaignait. Vraiment, mille francs, ce n’était pas assez. Ses enfants l’avaient abandonné, il se trouvait seul au monde, obligé de quitter la France. Peu s’en fallut qu’il ne pleurât en parlant de son exil.","Then Macquart, seeing that he was about to be paid, began to moan. He had understood too late the consequences of his betrayal; otherwise he would have demanded a sum twice and three times as great. And he complained. Really, a thousand francs was not enough. His children had abandoned him, he found himself alone in the world, forced to leave France. He almost cried when he spoke of his exile.","Thereupon Macquart, seeing that he was about to be paid, began to moan. He had only learnt the consequence of his treachery when it was too late; otherwise he would have demanded twice or thrice as much. And he complained bitterly.

He almost wept as he spoke of his coming exile.","Thereupon Macquart, seeing that he was about to be paid, began to moan.

"Cette offre brusque de cent francs éblouit le camarade d’Antoine. Il regarda ce dernier d’un air ravi qui signifiait clairement : « Du moment que le bourgeois offre cent francs, il n’y a plus de sottises à lui dire. » Mais Antoine entendait spéculer sur les bonnes dispositions de son frère. Il lui demanda s’il se moquait de lui ; c’était sa part, dix mille francs, qu’il exigeait.","This abrupt offer of a hundred francs dazzled Antoine's comrade. He looked at the latter with an air of delight which clearly meant: ""As soon as the bourgeois offers a hundred francs, there is no more foolishness to say to him.""

He asked him if he was making fun of him; it was his share, ten thousand francs, that he demanded.","This abrupt offer of a hundred francs dazzled Antoine’s companion. He looked at the other with an air of delight, which clearly signified: “As the gentleman offers a hundred francs, it is time to leave off abusing him.” But Antoine was determined to speculate on his brother’s favourable disposition. He asked him whether he took him for a fool; it was his share, ten thousand francs, that he wanted.","This sudden offer of a hundred francs greatly impressed Antoine’s friend. He looked at Antoine with an air of delight, which clearly signified: ‘Since the gentleman is offering a hundred francs, it’s time to leave off insulting him.’ But Antoine was determined to speculate on his brother’s change of heart. He asked him if he took him for a fool; it was his share, ten thousand francs, that he wanted."
"Le fils des Macquart, Jean, naquit trois ans plus tard. Ce fut un fort gaillard, qui ne rappela en rien les maigreurs de Gervaise. Il tenait de sa mère, comme la fille aînée, sans avoir sa ressemblance physique. Il apportait, le premier, chez les Rougon-Macquart, un visage aux traits réguliers, et qui avait la froideur grasse d’une nature sérieuse et peu intelligente. Ce garçon grandit avec la volonté tenace de se créer un jour une position indépendante. Il fréquenta assidûment l’école et s’y cassa la tête, qu’il avait fort dure, pour y faire entrer un peu d’arithmétique et d’orthographe. Il se mit ensuite en apprentissage, en renouvelant les mêmes efforts, entêtement d’autant plus méritoire qu’il lui fallait un jour pour apprendre ce que d’autres savaient en une heure.","The Macquarts' son, Jean, was born three years later. He was a strong fellow, who in no way recalled Gervaise's leanness. He took after his mother, like the eldest daughter, without having her physical resemblance. He was the first to bring to the Rougon-Macquarts a face with regular features, and which had the greasy coldness of a serious and unintelligent nature. This boy grew up with the tenacious desire to one day create an independent position for himself. He assiduously attended school and racked his brains, which he had very hard, to introduce a little arithmetic and spelling. He then began to learn, renewing the same efforts, a stubbornness all the more meritorious in that he needed a day to learn what others knew in an hour.","The chief female character in L’Assommoir (The Dramshop). The Macquarts’ son, Jean,[*] was born three years later. He was a robust child, in no respect recalling Gervaise. Like the eldest girl, he took after his mother, without having any physical resemblance to her. He was the first to import into the Rougon-Macquart stock a fat face with regular features, which showed all the coldness of a grave yet not over-intelligent nature. This boy grew up with the determination of some day making an independent position for himself. He attended school diligently, and tortured his dull brain to force a little arithmetic and spelling into it.

"« À votre aise, mon cher, dit-elle froidement. Vraiment, vous n’avez pas conscience de votre position. Vous êtes venu chez moi me traiter de vieille gueuse, et lorsque j’ai la bonté de vous tendre la main dans le trou où vous avez eu la sottise de tomber, vous faites des façons, vous ne voulez pas être sauvé. Eh bien ! restez ici, attendez que les autorités reviennent. Moi, je m’en lave les mains. »","""As you please, my dear,"" she said coldly. Really, you are not aware of your position.

Well ! stay here, wait for the authorities to come back. I wash my hands of it. »","“Just as you like my dear fellow,” she said, coldly. “You don’t seem to realise the position you are in. You came to my house and treated me as though I were a mere outcast; and then, when I am kind enough to hold out a hand to you in the hole into which you have stupidly let yourself fall, you stand on ceremony, and refuse to be rescued.

"Et comme Miette, toute surprise, levait vers lui ses yeux redevenus humides et souriants, il continua avec vivacité :","And as Miette, quite surprised, raised her eyes towards him, which had become moist and smiling again, he continued with vivacity:","And as Miette, in surprise, raised her eyes, which were again moist and smiling, he continued with animation: “I know that people try to vex you.","Miette looked up at him in surprise, her eyes soft and smiling again; and so he quickly continued:"
"« Parbleu ! mon frère ne s’est jamais conduit en frère avec moi, dit Macquart avec une violence contenue. Est-ce qu’il est venu à mon secours ? Il m’aurait laissé crever dans mon taudis… Quand il a été gentil avec moi, vous vous rappelez, à l’époque des deux cents francs, je crois qu’on ne peut pas me reprocher d’avoir dit du mal de lui. Je répétais partout que c’était un bon cœur. »","“Parbleu! my brother has never behaved like a brother to me,” said Macquart with restrained violence. Did he come to my rescue?

I repeated everywhere that it was a good heart. »","“But, dash it, my brother has never behaved like a brother to me,” Macquart replied, with restrained violence. “Has he ever given me any assistance? He would have let me die in my hovel! When he behaved differently towards me—you remember, at the time he gave me two hundred francs—I am sure no one can reproach me with having said a single unpleasant word about him.

"C’était là, en effet, la joie inespérée qui les ravissait. Ils ne parlaient guère que pour voir remuer leurs lèvres, tant ce jeu nouveau amusait l’enfance qui était encore en eux. Aussi se promirent-ils sur tous les tons de ne jamais manquer au rendez-vous matinal. Quand Miette eut déclaré qu’il lui fallait s’en aller, elle dit à Silvère qu’il pouvait tirer son seau d’eau. Mais Silvère n’osait remuer la corde : Miette était restée penchée, il voyait toujours son visage souriant, et il lui en coûtait trop d’effacer ce sourire. À un léger ébranlement qu’il donna au seau, l’eau frémit, le sourire de Miette pâlit. Il s’arrêta, pris d’une étrange crainte : il s’imaginait qu’il venait de la contrarier et qu’elle pleurait. Mais l’enfant lui cria : « Va donc ! va donc ! » avec un rire que l’écho lui renvoyait plus prolongé et plus sonore. Et elle fit elle-même descendre un seau bruyamment. Il y eut une tempête. Tout disparut sous l’eau noire. Silvère alors se décida à emplir ses deux cruches, en écoutant les pas de Miette, qui s’éloignait, de l’autre côté de la muraille.","This was, in fact, the unexpected joy that delighted them. They scarcely spoke except to see their lips move, so much did this new game amuse the childhood which was still within them. So they promised each other in all tones never to miss the morning rendezvous. When Miette had declared that she had to go, she told Silvere that he could get his bucket of water. But Silvere dared not move the rope: Miette had remained leaning over, he still saw her smiling face, and it cost him too much to erase that smile. At a slight shake he gave to the bucket, the water quivered, Miette's smile paled. He stopped, seized with a strange fear: he imagined that he had just upset her and that she was crying. But the child cried out to him, “Go! go then ! with a laugh that echoed back longer and louder. And she herself lowered a bucket noisily. There was a storm. Everything disappeared under the black water. Silvere then decided to fill his two jugs, listening to the steps of Miette, who was going away, on the other side of the wall.","It was, in fact, this unhoped-for pleasure which so delighted them. They only spoke to see their lips move, so greatly did this new frolic amuse their childish natures. And they resolved to use all means in their power to meet here every morning. When Miette had said that she must go away, she told Silvère that he could draw his pail of water. But he did not dare to shake the rope; Miette was still leaning over—he could see her smiling face, and it was too painful to him to dispel that smile. As he slightly stirred his pail, the water murmured, and the smile faded. Then he stopped, seized with a strange fear; he fancied that he had vexed her and made her cry. But the child called to him, “Go on! go on!” with a laugh which the echo prolonged and rendered more sonorous. She herself then nosily sent down a pail. There was a perfect tempest. Everything disappeared under the black water. And Silvère made up his mind to fill two pitchers, while listening to the retreating steps of Miette on the other side of the wall.","This unexpected pleasure delighted them.

"Ils ne purent trouver d’autres paroles. Le coin désert du chantier, la ruelle verte reprit son calme mélancolique ; il n’y eut plus que la lune vivante faisant tourner sur l’herbe l’ombre des tas de planches. Le groupe formé par les deux jeunes gens sur la pierre tombale était devenu immobile et muet, dans la clarté pâle. Silvère avait passé le bras autour de la taille de Miette, et celle-ci s’était laissée aller contre son épaule.

"Elle laissa croître ses enfants comme ces pruniers qui poussent le long des routes, au bon plaisir de la pluie et du soleil. Ils portèrent leurs fruits naturels, en sauvageons que la serpe n’a point greffés ni taillés. Jamais la nature ne fut moins contrariée, jamais petits êtres malfaisants ne grandirent plus franchement dans le sens de leurs instincts. En attendant, ils se roulaient dans les plants de légumes, passant leur vie en plein air, à jouer et à se battre comme des vauriens. Ils volaient les provisions du logis, ils dévastaient les quelques arbres fruitiers de l’enclos, ils étaient les démons familiers, pillards et criards, de cette étrange maison de la folie lucide. Quand leur mère disparaissait pendant des journées entières, leur vacarme devenait tel, ils trouvaient des inventions si diaboliques pour molester les gens, que les voisins devaient les menacer d’aller leur donner le fouet. Adélaïde, d’ailleurs, ne les effrayait guère ; lorsqu’elle était là, s’ils devenaient moins insupportables aux autres, c’est qu’ils la prenaient pour victime, manquant l’école régulièrement cinq ou six fois par semaine, faisant tout au monde pour s’attirer une correction qui leur eût permis de brailler à leur aise. Mais jamais elle ne les frappait, ni même ne s’emportait ; elle vivait très bien au milieu du bruit, molle, placide, l’esprit perdu. À la longue même, l’affreux tapage de ces garnements lui devint nécessaire pour emplir le vide de son cerveau. Elle souriait doucement, quand elle entendait dire : « Ses enfants la battront, et ce sera bien fait. » À toutes choses, son allure indifférente semblait répondre : « Qu’importe ! » Elle s’occupait de son bien encore moins que de ses enfants. L’enclos des Fouque, pendant les longues années que dura cette singulière existence, serait devenu un terrain vague, si la jeune femme n’avait eu la bonne chance de confier la culture de ses légumes à un habile maraîcher. Cet homme, qui devait partager les bénéfices avec elle, la volait impudemment, ce dont elle ne s’aperçut jamais. D’ailleurs, cela eut un heureux côté : pour la voler davantage, le maraîcher tira le plus grand parti possible du terrain, qui doubla presque de valeur.","She let her children grow like those plum trees that grow along the roads, to the delight of the rain and the sun.

In the meantime, they rolled around in the vegetable beds, spending their lives in the open air, playing and fighting like rascals. They stole the provisions of the house, they devastated the few fruit trees of the enclosure, they were the familiar, looting and screaming demons of this strange house of lucid madness. When their mother disappeared for whole days, their uproar became such, they found such diabolical inventions to molest people, that the neighbors had to threaten them with going to whip them. Adelaide, moreover, hardly alarmed them; when she was there, if they became less unbearable to others, it was because they took her as a victim, regularly missing school five or six times a week, doing everything in the world to attract a beating that would would have allowed them to bawl at their ease.

"Rougon voulut courir après lui, avoir d’autres renseignements ; mais il était déjà loin. Certes, la commission n’eut pas envie de se rendormir. Des bruits étranges ! des feux ! une attaque ! et cela, au milieu de la nuit ! Aviser, c’était facile à dire, mais que faire ? Granoux faillit conseiller la même tactique qui leur avait réussi la veille : se cacher, attendre que les insurgés eussent traversé Plassans, et triompher ensuite dans les rues désertes. Pierre, heureusement, se souvenant des conseils de sa femme, dit que Roudier avait pu se tromper, et que le mieux était d’aller voir. Certains membres firent la grimace ; mais quand il fut convenu qu’une escorte armée accompagnerait la commission, tous descendirent avec un grand courage. En bas, ils ne laissèrent que quelques hommes ; ils se firent entourer par une trentaine de gardes nationaux ; puis ils s’aventurèrent dans la ville endormie. La lune seule, glissant au ras des toits, allongeait ses ombres lentes. Ils allèrent vainement le long des remparts, de porte en porte, l’horizon muré, ne voyant rien, n’entendant rien. Les gardes nationaux des différents postes leur dirent bien que des souffles particuliers leur venaient de la campagne, par-dessus les portails fermés ; ils tendirent l’oreille sans saisir autre chose qu’un bruissement lointain, que Granoux prétendit reconnaître pour la clameur de la Viorne.","Rougon wanted to run after him, to get other information; but he was already far away. Certainly, the commission did not want to go back to sleep. Strange noises! fires ! an attack ! And that, in the middle of the night! Notifying was easy to say, but what to do? Granoux almost advised the same tactic which had succeeded the day before: hide, wait until the insurgents had crossed Plassans, and then triumph in the deserted streets. Pierre, fortunately, remembering his wife's advice, said that Roudier might have been mistaken, and that the best thing was to go and see. Some members grimaced; but when it was agreed that an armed escort should accompany the commission, all descended with great courage. Below, they left only a few men; they caused themselves to be surrounded by about thirty National Guards; then they ventured into the sleeping town. The moon alone, gliding over the roofs, lengthened its slow shadows. They went vainly along the ramparts, from door to door, the horizon walled up, seeing nothing, hearing nothing. The National Guardsmen of the different posts told them that particular breaths came to them from the countryside, above the closed gates; they strained their ears without seizing anything other than a distant rustling, which Granoux pretended to recognize as the clamor of the Viorne.","Rougon would have followed him, to obtain further particulars, but he was already too far away. After this the Commission was by no means inclined to go to sleep again. Strange noises! Fires! An attack! And in the middle of the night too! It was very easy to talk of taking precautions, but what were they to do? Granoux was very near advising the course which had proved so successful the previous evening: that is of hiding themselves, waiting till the insurgents has passed through Plassans, and then triumphing in the deserted streets. Pierre, however, fortunately remembering his wife’s advice, said that Roudier might have made a mistake, and that the best thing would be to go and see for themselves. Some of the members made a wry face at this suggestion; but when it had been agreed that an armed escort should accompany the Commission, they all descended very courageously. They only left a few men downstairs; they surrounded themselves with about thirty of the national guards, and then they ventured into the slumbering town, where the moon, creeping over the house roofs, slowly cast lengthened shadows. They went along the ramparts, from one gate to the other, seeing nothing and hearing nothing. The national guards at the various posts certainly told them that peculiar sounds occasionally reached them from the country through the closed gates. When they strained their ears, however, they detected nothing but a distant murmur, which Granoux said was merely the noise of the Viorne.","Rougon would have run after him to get more information, but he was already too far away.

"La panique de la nuit grandit encore l’effet terrible causé, le matin, par la vue des quatre cadavres. Jamais l’histoire vraie de cette fusillade ne fut connue. Les coups de feu des combattants, les coups de marteau de Granoux, la débandade des gardes nationaux lâchés dans les rues, avaient empli les oreilles de bruits si terrifiants, que le plus grand nombre rêva toujours une bataille gigantesque, livrée à un nombre incalculable d’ennemis. Quand les vainqueurs, grossissant le chiffre de leurs adversaires par une vantardise instinctive, parlèrent d’environ cinq cents hommes, on se récria ; des bourgeois prétendirent s’être mis à la fenêtre et avoir vu passer, pendant plus d’une heure, le flot épais des fuyards. Tout le monde, d’ailleurs, avait entendu courir les bandits sous les croisées. Jamais cinq cents hommes n’auraient pu de la sorte éveiller une ville en sursaut. C’était une armée, une belle et bonne armée que la brave milice de Plassans avait fait rentrer sous terre. Ce mot que prononça Rougon : « Ils sont rentrés sous terre », parut d’une grande justesse, car les postes, chargés de défendre les remparts, jurèrent toujours leurs grands dieux que pas un homme n’était entré ni sorti ; ce qui ajouta au fait d’armes une pointe de mystère, une idée de diables cornus s’abîmant dans les flammes, qui acheva de détraquer les imaginations. Il est vrai que les postes évitèrent de raconter leurs galops furieux. Aussi, les gens les plus raisonnables s’arrêtèrent-ils à la pensée qu’une bande d’insurgés avait dû pénétrer par une brèche, par un trou quelconque. Plus tard, des bruits de trahison se répandirent, on parla d’un guet-apens ; sans doute, les hommes menés par Macquart à la tuerie, ne purent garder l’atroce vérité ; mais une telle terreur régnait encore, la vue du sang avait jeté à la réaction un tel nombre de poltrons, qu’on attribua ces bruits à la rage des républicains vaincus. On prétendit, d’autre part, que Macquart était prisonnier de Rougon, et que celui-ci le gardait dans un cachot humide, où il le laissait lentement mourir de faim. Cet horrible conte fit saluer Rougon jusqu’à terre.","The panic of the night increases still further the terrible effect caused, in the morning, by the sight of the four corpses. The true story of this shooting was never known. The gunshots of the combatants, the hammer blows of Granoux, the rout of the National Guards let loose in the streets, had filled the ears with noises so terrifying that the greatest number always dreamed of a gigantic battle, fought by an incalculable number of soldiers. 'enemies. When the victors, increasing the numbers of their adversaries by instinctive boasting, spoke of about five hundred men, people protested; bourgeois pretended to have gone to the window and to have seen the thick stream of fugitives pass by for more than an hour. Everyone, moreover, had heard the bandits running under the windows. Five hundred men could never have awakened a city with a start. It was an army, a fine and good army, which the brave militia of Plassans had driven underground. The words that Rougon uttered: “They have gone underground,” seemed very accurate, for the posts, responsible for defending the ramparts, always swore to their great gods that not a man had entered or left; which added to the feat of arms a touch of mystery, an idea of horned devils sinking into the flames, which completely derailed the imaginations. It is true that the posts avoided telling of their furious gallops. Also, the most reasonable people paused at the thought that a band of insurgents must have entered through a breach, through some hole. Later, rumors of treason spread, there was talk of an ambush; no doubt the men led by Macquart to the slaughter could not keep the atrocious truth; but such terror still reigned, the sight of blood had thrown such a number of cowards into reaction, that these rumors were attributed to the rage of the vanquished Republicans. It was claimed, on the other hand, that Macquart was a prisoner of Rougon, and that the latter kept him in a damp dungeon, where he left him slowly to die of hunger. This horrible tale made Rougon bow to the ground.","The panic of the night further augmented the terrible effect produced in the morning by the sight of the four corpses. The true history of the fusillade was never known. The firing of the combatants, Granoux’s hammering, the helter-skelter rush of the national guards through the streets, had filled people’s ears with such terrifying sounds that most of them dreamed of a gigantic battle waged against countless enemies. When the victors, magnifying the number of their adversaries with instinctive braggardism, spoke of about five hundred men, everybody protested against such a low estimate. Some citizens asserted that they had looked out of their windows and seen an immense stream of fugitives passing by for more than an hour. Moreover everybody had heard the bandits running about. Five hundred men would never have been able to rouse a whole town. It must have been an army, and a fine big army too, which the brave militia of Plassans had “driven back into the ground.” This phrase of their having been “driven back into the ground,” first used by Rougon, struck people as being singularly appropriate, for the guards who were charged with the defence of the ramparts swore by all that was holy that not a single man had entered or quitted the town, a circumstance which tinged what had happened with mystery, even suggesting the idea of horned demons who had vanished amidst flames, and thus fairly upsetting the minds of the multitude. It is true the guards avoided all mention of their mad gallops; and so the more rational citizens were inclined to believe that a band of insurgents had really entered the town either by a breach in the wall or some other channel. Later on, rumours of treachery were spread abroad, and people talked of an ambush. The cruel truth could no longer be concealed by the men whom Macquart had led to slaughter, but so much terror still prevailed, and the sight of blood had thrown so many cowards into the arms of the reactionary party, that these rumours were attributed to the rage of the vanquished Republicans. It was asserted, on the other hand, that Macquart had been made prisoner by Rougon, who kept him in a damp cell, where he was letting him slowly die of starvation. This horrible tale made people bow to the very ground whenever they encountered Rougon.","The panic of the night heightened even further the terrible effect produced in the morning by the sight of the four corpses. The true story of the shooting was never known. The gunfire, Granoux’s hammering, and the wild rush of the Guardsmen through the streets had filled people’s ears with such terrifying sounds that most of them imagined that what had occurred was a titanic battle waged against overwhelming odds. When the victors, exaggerating with instinctive boastfulness the number of their adversaries, spoke of about five hundred, everybody protested at this low estimate; some of the good townsfolk asserted that when they had looked out of their window they had seen a great stream of insurgents fleeing past for at least an hour.

It is true that the Guardsmen avoided all mention of their mad galloping through the streets; and so the more rational townspeople came to the view that a band of insurgents had really entered the town either by a breach in the wall or by some other channel.

"Quelle journée ! Les Rougon en parlent encore, comme d’une bataille glorieuse et décisive. Pierre alla droit à la mairie, sans s’inquiéter des regards ni des paroles qu’il surprit au passage. Il s’y installa magistralement, en homme qui entend ne plus quitter la place. Il envoya simplement un mot à Roudier, pour l’avertir qu’il reprenait le pouvoir. « Veillez aux portes, disait-il, sachant que ces lignes pouvaient devenir publiques ; moi, je veillerai à l’intérieur, je ferai respecter les propriétés et les personnes. C’est au moment où les mauvaises passions renaissent et l’emportent, que les bons citoyens doivent chercher à les étouffer, au péril de leur vie. » Le style, les fautes d’orthographe rendaient plus héroïque ce billet, d’un laconisme antique. Pas un de ces messieurs de la commission provisoire ne parut. Les deux derniers fidèles, Granoux lui-même, se tinrent prudemment chez eux. De cette commission, dont les membres s’étaient évanouis, à mesure que la panique soufflait plus forte, il n’y avait que Rougon qui restât à son poste, sur son fauteuil de président. Il ne daigna pas même envoyer un ordre de convocation. Lui seul, et c’était assez. Sublime spectacle qu’un journal de la localité devait plus tard caractériser d’un mot : « le courage donnant la main au devoir. »","What a day ! The Rougons still speak of it, as of a glorious and decisive battle. Pierre went straight to the town hall, without worrying about the looks or the words he overheard as he passed. He installed himself there masterfully, like a man who intends to never leave the place. He simply sent a word to Roudier, to inform him that he was regaining power. “Watch the gates,” he would say, knowing that these lines might become public; I will watch over the interior, I will ensure respect for properties and people. It is when bad passions are reborn and prevail that good citizens must seek to stifle them, at the risk of their lives. “The style, the spelling errors made this post more heroic, with an ancient laconicism.

"Et ce fut ainsi que, pendant près de deux années, ils s’aimèrent dans l’allée étroite, dans la campagne large. Leur idylle traversa les pluies glacées de décembre et les brûlantes sollicitations de juillet, sans glisser à la honte des amours communes ; elle garda son charme exquis de conte grec, son ardente pureté, tous ses balbutiements naïfs de la chair qui désire et qui ignore. Les morts, les vieux morts eux-mêmes, chuchotèrent vainement à leurs oreilles. Et ils n’emportèrent de l’ancien cimetière qu’une mélancolie attendrie, que le pressentiment vague d’une vie courte ; une voix leur disait qu’ils s’en iraient, avec leurs tendresses vierges, avant les noces, le jour où ils voudraient se donner l’un à l’autre. Sans doute ce fut là, sur la pierre tombale, au milieu des ossements cachés sous les herbes grasses, qu’ils respirèrent leur amour de la mort, cet âpre désir de se coucher ensemble dans la terre, qui les faisait balbutier au bord de la route d’Orchères, par cette nuit de décembre, tandis que les deux cloches se renvoyaient leurs appels lamentables.","And so it was that for nearly two years they loved each other in the narrow alley, in the wide countryside. Their idyll passed through the icy rains of December and the burning solicitations of July, without slipping into the shame of common loves; it kept its exquisite charm of a Greek tale, its ardent purity, all its naive stammerings of the flesh which desires and which ignores. The dead, the old dead themselves, whispered vainly in their ears. And they took away from the old cemetery only a tender melancholy, only the vague presentiment of a short life; a voice told them that they would go away, with their virgin tenderness, before the wedding, the day when they wanted to give themselves to each other. No doubt it was there, on the tombstone, in the midst of the bones hidden under the thick grass, that they breathed in their love of death, that bitter desire to lie down together in the earth, which made them stammer on the edge of the route d'Orcheres, on this December night, while the two bells were sending back their lamentable calls.","And so, for nearly two years, their love grew alike in the narrow pathway and the open country. Their idyll passed through the chilling rains of December and the burning solicitations of July, free from all touch of impurity, ever retaining the sweet charm of some old Greek love-tale, all the naive hesitancy of youth which desires but knows not. In vain did the long-departed dead whisper in their ears. They carried nothing away from the old cemetery but emotional melancholy and a vague presentiment of a short life. A voice seemed to whisper to them that they would depart amidst their virginal love, long ere the bridal day would give them wholly to each other. It was there, on the tombstone and among the bones that lay hidden beneath the rank grass, that they had first come to indulge in that longing for death, that eager desire to sleep together in the earth, that now set them stammering and sighing beside the Orcheres road, on that December night, while the two bells repeated their mournful warnings to one another.","In this way, for nearly two years, their love grew in the little lane and the open country. Their idyll passed through the chilling rains of December and the burning sun of July, never losing its purity; it had the exquisite charm of an ancient Greek love story, with its passionate simplicity and all the naive hesitancy of the body that desires but is ignorant of its desire. The dead, the long-departed dead, whispered vainly in their ears. They carried away from the old cemetery only feelings of melancholy and a vague presentiment of a short life; a voice seemed to tell them that they would leave the earth, their love still virginal, long before their wedding day when they would want to give themselves to each other.

"Silvère, comme tous les autres prisonniers, avait un compagnon de chaîne. Il était attaché par un bras à un paysan de Poujols, un nommé Mourgue, homme de cinquante ans, dont les grands soleils et le dur métier de la terre avaient fait une brute. Déjà voûté, les mains roidies, la face plate, il clignait les yeux, hébété, avec cette expression entêtée et méfiante des animaux battus. Il était parti, armé d’une fourche, parce que tout son village partait ; mais il n’aurait jamais pu expliquer ce qui le jetait ainsi sur les grandes routes. Depuis qu’on l’avait fait prisonnier, il comprenait encore moins. Il croyait vaguement qu’on le ramenait chez lui. L’étonnement de se voir attaché, la vue de tout ce monde qui le regardait, l’ahurissaient, l’abêtissaient davantage. Comme il ne parlait et n’entendait que le patois, il ne put deviner ce que voulait le gendarme. Il levait vers lui sa face épaisse, faisant effort ; puis, s’imaginant qu’on lui demandait le nom de son pays, il dit de sa voix rauque :","Silvere, like all the other prisoners, had a chain mate. He was tied by one arm to a peasant from Poujols, a man named Mourgue, a man of fifty, whose great suns and hard work on the earth had made him a brute.

He had left, armed with a pitchfork, because his whole village was leaving; but he could never have explained what threw him thus on the high roads. Since they had taken him prisoner, he understood even less. He vaguely believed that he was being taken home. The astonishment of seeing himself tied up, the sight of everyone staring at him, bewildered him, stupefied him even more.

"Pendant plus de trente ans la bataille dura. Lorsque Puech mourut, ce fut un nouveau coup de massue. Félicité, qui comptait hériter d’une quarantaine de mille francs, apprit que le vieil égoïste, pour mieux dorloter ses vieux jours, avait placé sa petite fortune à fonds perdu. Elle en fit une maladie. Elle s’aigrissait peu à peu, elle devenait plus sèche, plus stridente. À la voir tourbillonner, du matin au soir, autour des jarres d’huile, on eût dit qu’elle croyait activer la vente par ces vols continuels de mouche inquiète. Son mari, au contraire, s’appesantissait ; le guignon l’engraissait, le rendait plus épais et plus mou. Ces trente années de lutte ne les menèrent cependant pas à la ruine. À chaque inventaire annuel, ils joignaient à peu près les deux bouts ; s’ils éprouvaient des pertes pendant une saison, ils les réparaient à la saison suivante. C’était cette vie au jour le jour qui exaspérait Félicité. Elle eût préféré une belle et bonne faillite. Peut-être auraient-ils pu alors recommencer leur vie, au lieu de s’entêter dans l’infiniment petit, de se brûler le sang pour ne gagner que leur strict nécessaire. En un tiers de siècle, ils ne mirent pas cinquante mille francs de côté.","For more than thirty years the battle lasted. When Puech died, it was a new blow. Félicité, who counted on inheriting some forty thousand francs, learned that the egotistical old man, the better to pamper his old age, had invested his small fortune as a lost fund. She made it a disease. She grew sour little by little, she became drier, more strident. To see her swirling around, from morning to night, around the jars of oil, one would have said that she thought she was encouraging the sale by these continual flights of anxious flies. Her husband, on the contrary, was growing heavy; the bad luck fattened it up, made it thicker and softer. These thirty years of struggle did not, however, bring them to ruin. At each annual inventory, they pretty much made ends meet; if they suffered losses during one season, they repaired them the following season. It was this day-to-day life that exasperated Félicité. She would have preferred a beautiful and good bankruptcy. Perhaps they could then have started their lives over again, instead of persisting in the infinitely small, burning their blood to earn only what was strictly necessary. In a third of a century they did not put fifty thousand francs aside.","The battle lasted for more than thirty years. The death of Puech proved another heavy blow. Félicité, who had counted upon an inheritance of about forty thousand francs, found that the selfish old man, in order to indulge himself in his old age, had sunk all his money in a life annuity. The discovery made her quite ill. She was gradually becoming soured, she was growing more lean and harsh. To see her, from morning till night, whirling round the jars of oil, one would have thought she believed that she could stimulate the sales by continually flitting about like a restless fly. Her husband, on the contrary, became heavier; misfortune fattened him, making him duller and more indolent. These thirty years of combat did not, however, bring him to ruin. At each annual stock-taking they managed to make both ends meet fairly well; if they suffered any loss during one season, they recouped themselves the next. However, it was precisely this living from hand to mouth which exasperated Félicité. She would, by far, have preferred a big failure. They would then, perhaps, have been able to commence life over again, instead of obstinately persisting in their petty business, working themselves to death to gain the bare necessaries of life. During one third of a century they did not save fifty thousand francs.","The struggle lasted more than thirty years. The death of Puesch proved another heavy blow.

Her husband, on the other hand, put on weight; misfortune made him fat, duller, and lazier. Their thirty years of struggle did not, however, bring them to the point of ruin. At each annual stocktaking they managed more or less to make ends meet; if they suffered any losses during one season, they recouped them the next. But it was precisely this hand-to-mouth existence that exasperated Félicité. She would by far have preferred total bankruptcy. Then, perhaps, they would have been able to make a fresh start, instead of persisting with their petty business, working themselves to death for the bare necessities of life. Over the course of a third of a century, they saved less than fifty thousand francs."
"Il perdait la tête, il ne se rappelait plus qu’il s’était montré aussi âpre que sa femme. Il n’éprouvait qu’un immense désir, celui de soulager sa colère en accusant les autres de sa défaite.","He was losing his mind, he no longer remembered that he had been as harsh as his wife. He had only one great desire to relieve his anger by blaming others for his defeat.","He was losing his head completely, and forgot that he had shown himself as eager as his wife. However, his only desire now was to vent his anger, by laying the blame of his ruin upon others.","He had lost all sense of perspective, forgetting that he had been as keen as his wife to profit from the coup d’état. But all he wanted now was to vent his anger by blaming everybody else for his ruin."
"Et, s’adressant à Pierre :","And, addressing Peter:","Then, addressing Pierre, he added: “When one has a brother like yours, sir, one should rid society of him.","Then, addressing Pierre, he added:"

"Pierre sembla approuver vivement cette belle réponse. Quand il eut ainsi fait preuve d’ardent royalisme, il osa dire que le prince Louis Bonaparte avait ses sympathies, dans cette affaire. Ce fut alors, entre lui et le commandant, un échange de courtes phrases qui célébraient les excellentes intentions du président et qu’on eût dites préparées et apprises à l’avance. Pour la première fois, le bonapartisme entrait ouvertement dans le salon jaune. D’ailleurs, depuis l’élection du 10 décembre, le prince y était traité avec une certaine douceur. On le préférait mille fois à Cavaignac, et toute la bande réactionnaire avait voté pour lui. Mais on le regardait plutôt comme un complice que comme un ami ; encore se défiait-on de ce complice, que l’on commençait à accuser de vouloir garder pour lui les marrons après les avoir tirés du feu. Ce soir-là, cependant, grâce à la campagne de Rome, on écouta avec faveur les éloges de Pierre et du commandant.","Pierre seemed to strongly approve of this fine response. When he had thus given proof of ardent royalism, he dared to say that Prince Louis Bonaparte had his sympathies in this affair. There was then, between him and the commander, an exchange of short sentences which celebrated the excellent intentions of the president and which one would have said prepared and learned in advance. For the first time, Bonapartism entered openly into the yellow salon. Moreover, since the election of December 10, the prince was treated there with a certain kindness. They preferred him a thousand times to Cavaignac, and the whole reactionary band had voted for him. But he was looked upon more as an accomplice than a friend; yet people mistrusted this accomplice, who was beginning to be accused of wanting to keep the chestnuts for himself after having pulled them from the fire. That evening, however, thanks to the campaign in Rome, the praises of Peter and the commander were heard with favor.","Pierre seemed to approve this fine retort, and having thus given proof of his ardent royalism, he ventured to remark that Prince Louis Bonaparte had his entire sympathy in the matter. He thereupon exchanged a few short sentences with the commander, commending the excellent intentions of the President, which sentences one might have thought prepared and learnt beforehand. Bonapartism now, for the first time, made its entry into the yellow drawing-room. It is true that since the election of December 10 the Prince had been treated there with a certain amount of consideration. He was preferred a thousand times to Cavaignac, and the whole reactionary party had voted for him. But they regarded him rather as an accomplice than a friend; and, as such, they distrusted him, and even began to accuse him of a desire to keep for himself the chestnuts which he had pulled out of the fire. On that particular evening, however, owing to the fighting at Rome, they listened with favour to the praises of Pierre and the commander.","Pierre seemed to agree wholeheartedly with this fine retort, and having thus given proof of his ardent royalism, he ventured to remark that Prince Louis Bonaparte had his full support in the matter. Thereupon he exchanged a few brief remarks with the Commander, commending the excellent intentions of the President — remarks one might have thought prepared and learnt beforehand. Bonapartism had now, for the first time, made its official entry into the yellow drawing-room. It is true that, since the election of 10 December,* they had treated the Prince with a certain indulgence. He was infinitely preferable to Cavaignac,* and the whole reactionary party had voted for him. But they regarded him as an accomplice rather than as a friend; and, as such, they distrusted him, and even began to accuse him of wanting to turn to his own advantage the gains that had recently been made. On that particular evening, however, because of the military action in Rome, they listened approvingly to the praises of Pierre and the Commander."
"Cette note amphigourique avait été mûrement étudiée. La dernière phrase pouvait s’expliquer en faveur de tous les partis. De cette façon, après la victoire, Aristide se ménageait une superbe rentrée par un panégyrique des vainqueurs. Le lendemain, il se montra dans toute la ville, le bras en écharpe. Sa mère étant accourue, très effrayée par la note du journal, il refusa de lui montrer sa main et lui parla avec une amertume qui éclaira la vieille femme.","This amphigouric note had been carefully studied. The last sentence could be explained in favor of all parties. In this way, after the victory, Aristide prepared a superb comeback with a panegyric of the victors.

His mother having come running, very frightened by the note in the journal, he refused to show her his hand and spoke to her with a bitterness that enlightened the old woman.","This burlesque note had been maturely studied.

His mother, alarmed by the note in the paper, hurried to see him, but he refused to let her see his hand, and spoke to her in a bitter tone, which she understood."
"En quittant son frère, Aristide se sentit encore plus perplexe qu’auparavant. Eugène avait dû se moquer de lui, car Vuillet était bien le plus sale personnage qu’on pût imaginer. Il se promit d’être prudent, de ne pas se lier davantage, de façon à avoir les mains libres, s’il lui fallait un jour aider un parti à étrangler la République.","Leaving his brother, Aristide felt even more perplexed than before. Eugene must have laughed at him, because Vuillet was the dirtiest character one could imagine. He promised himself to be careful, not to bind himself any further, so as to have his hands free, if one day he had to help a party to strangle the Republic.","On parting from his brother, Aristide felt more perplexed than before. Eugène must certainly have been making game of him, for Vuillet was really the most abominable person imaginable. However, he determined to be prudent and not tie himself down any more; for he wished to have his hands free should he ever be called upon to help any party in strangling the Republic.","On parting from his brother, Aristide felt even more confused than before. Eugène must have been making fun of him, for Vuillet was certainly the most abominable person imaginable.

« As-tu lu mon article d’hier ? Qu’en penses-tu ? »,“Did you read my article yesterday? What do you think ? »,"In order to sound his brother, Aristide, who did not dare to appear openly uneasy, contented himself with asking: “Did you read my article yesterday? What do you think of it?”",‘Did you read my article yesterday? What did you think of it?’
"Et comme son mari se taisait, embarrassé, baissant les yeux, elle continua lentement, sans reproches :","And as her husband was silent, embarrassed, lowering his eyes, she continued slowly, without reproach:","And then, as her embarrassed husband held his tongue and lowered his eyes, she continued slowly, but not reproachfully: “You have not kept me informed of your affairs, have you?","Then, as her embarrassed husband said nothing and lowered his eyes, she continued slowly, but not reproachfully:"

"Pierre, abattu, moins tenace, aurait vingt fois liquidé sans l’attitude crispée et opiniâtre de sa femme. Elle voulait être riche.

Quand ils auraient quelques centaines de mille francs, ils seraient les maîtres de la ville ; elle ferait nommer son mari à un poste important, elle gouvernerait. Ce n’était pas la conquête des honneurs qui l’inquiétait ; elle se sentait merveilleusement armée pour cette lutte. Mais elle restait sans force devant les premiers sacs d’écus à gagner. Si le maniement des hommes ne l’effrayait pas, elle éprouvait une sorte de rage impuissante en face de ces pièces de cent sous, inertes, blanches et froides, sur lesquelles son esprit d’intrigue n’avait pas de prise, et qui se refusaient stupidement à elle.","Pierre, dejected, less tenacious, would have liquidated twenty times without the tense and stubborn attitude of his wife.

"Peu à peu, la pente de la route devenait moins rapide.

"Une députation se rendit alors à la mairie pour reprocher à la commission municipale la fermeture des portes, bonne seulement à irriter les insurgés. Rougon, qui perdait la tête, défendit son ordonnance avec ses dernières énergies ; ce double tour donné aux serrures lui semblait un des actes les plus ingénieux de son administration ; il trouva pour le justifier des paroles convaincues.

"« Me crois-tu beaucoup plus heureux que toi ? demanda Silvère, revenant malgré lui à la conversation. Si ma grand’mère ne m’avait pas recueilli et élevé, que serais-je devenu ?

"Quand les têtes des soldats apparurent au bord de l’esplanade, Silvère, d’un mouvement instinctif, se tourna vers Miette. Elle était là, grandie, le visage rose, dans les plis du drapeau rouge ; elle se haussait sur la pointe des pieds, pour voir la troupe ; une attente nerveuse faisait battre ses narines, montrait ses dents blanches de jeune loup dans la rougeur de ses lèvres. Silvère lui sourit. Et il n’avait pas tourné la tête, qu’une fusillade éclata. Les soldats, dont on ne voyait encore que les épaules, venaient de lâcher leur premier feu. Il lui sembla qu’un grand vent passait sur sa tête, tandis qu’une pluie de feuilles coupées par les balles tombaient des ormes. Un bruit sec, pareil à celui d’une branche morte qui se casse, le fit regarder à sa droite. Il vit par terre le grand bûcheron, celui dont la tête dépassait celles des autres, avec un petit trou noir au milieu du front. Alors il déchargea sa carabine devant lui, sans viser, puis il rechargea, tira de nouveau. Et cela, toujours, comme un furieux, comme une bête qui ne pense à rien, qui se dépêche de tuer. Il ne distinguait même plus les soldats ; des fumées flottaient sous les ormes, pareilles à des lambeaux de mousseline grise. Les feuilles continuaient à pleuvoir sur les insurgés, la troupe tirait trop haut. Par instants, dans les bruits déchirants de la fusillade, le jeune homme entendait un soupir, un râle sourd ; et il y avait dans la petite bande une poussée, comme pour faire de la place au malheureux qui tombait en se cramponnant aux épaules de ses voisins. Pendant dix minutes, le feu dura.","When the heads of the soldiers appeared at the edge of the esplanade, Silvere, with an instinctive movement, turned towards Miette. She was there, grown up, her face rosy, in the folds of the red flag; she rose on tiptoe to see the troops; a nervous expectation made his nostrils flutter, showed his white teeth of a young wolf in the redness of his lips. Silvere smiled at him. And he had not turned his head when a shooting broke out. The soldiers, of whom only their shoulders could still be seen, had just let off their first fire. It seemed to him that a great wind passed over his head, while a shower of leaves cut by the bullets fell from the elm trees. A snap, like a dead branch breaking, made him look to his right. He saw the big woodcutter on the ground, the one whose head was higher than the others, with a small black hole in the middle of his forehead. So he discharged his rifle in front of him, without aiming, then he reloaded, fired again. And that, always, like a madman, like an animal who thinks of nothing, who hurries to kill. He could no longer even distinguish the soldiers; smoke floated under the elms, like shreds of gray muslin. The leaves continued to rain down on the insurgents, the troops were firing too high. From time to time, in the heart-rending sounds of the fusillade, the young man heard a sigh, a dull rattle; and there was a thrust in the little band, as if to make room for the unfortunate man who was falling, clinging to the shoulders of his neighbors. For ten minutes the fire lasted.","When the heads of the soldiers appeared on a level with the esplanade, Silvère instinctively turned to Miette. She stood there with flushed face, looking taller than ever amidst the folds of the red banner; she was indeed standing on tiptoes in order to see the troops, and nervous expectation made her nostrils quiver and her red lips part so as to show her white, eager, gleaming teeth. Silvère smiled at her. But he had scarcely turned his head when a fusillade burst out. The soldiers, who could only be seen from their shoulders upwards, had just fired their first volley. It seemed to Silvère as though a great gust of wind was passing over his head, while a shower of leaves, lopped off by the bullets, fell from the elms. A sharp sound, like the snapping of a dead branch, made him look to his right. Then, prone on the ground, he saw the big wood-cutter, he who was a head taller than the others. There was a little black hole in the middle of his forehead. And thereupon Silvère fired straight before him, without taking aim, reloaded and fired again like a madman or an unthinking wild beast, in haste only to kill. He could not even distinguish the soldiers now; smoke, resembling strips of grey muslin, was floating under the elms. The leaves still rained upon the insurgents, for the troops were firing too high. Every now and then, athwart the fierce crackling of the fusillade, the young man heard a sigh or a low rattle, and a rush was made among the band as if to make room for some poor wretch clutching hold of his neighbours as he fell. The firing lasted ten minutes.","When the heads of the soldiers appeared on a level with the esplanade Silvère turned instinctively to Miette.

"La bourgeoisie, les commerçants retirés, les avocats, les notaires, tout le petit monde aisé et ambitieux qui peuple la ville neuve, tâche de donner quelque vie à Plassans. Ceux-là vont aux soirées de M. le sous-préfet et rêvent de rendre des fêtes pareilles. Ils font volontiers de la popularité, appellent un ouvrier « mon brave », parlent des récoltes aux paysans, lisent les journaux, se promènent le dimanche avec leurs dames. Ce sont les esprits avancés de l’endroit, les seuls qui se permettent de rire en parlant des remparts ; ils ont même plusieurs fois réclamé de « l’édilité » la démolition de ces vieilles murailles, « vestige d’un autre âge ». D’ailleurs, les plus sceptiques d’entre eux reçoivent une violente commotion de joie chaque fois qu’un marquis ou un comte veut bien les honorer d’un léger salut.

Ils savent bien que ce rêve est irréalisable, et c’est ce qui leur fait crier très haut qu’ils sont libres penseurs, des libres penseurs tout de paroles, fort amis de l’autorité, se jetant dans les bras du premier sauveur venu, au moindre grondement du peuple.","The bourgeoisie, the retired merchants, the lawyers, the notaries, all the well-off and ambitious little people who populate the new town, try to give some life to Plassans.

At the same time, the most sceptical among them experience a shock of delight whenever a marquis or a count deigns to honour them with a stiff salutation. Indeed, the dream of every citizen of the new town is to be admitted to a drawing-room of the Saint-Marc quarter. They know very well that their ambition is not attainable, and it is this which makes them proclaim all the louder that they are freethinkers.

They attend the subprefect’s soirées and dream of offering their own forms of entertainment. They crave popularity, ingratiate themselves with workmen, chat with the peasants about the latest harvest, read the newspapers, and walk out with their wives on Sundays. They are the progressive thinkers of the town, and the only ones who dare to speak disparagingly of the ramparts; in fact, they have demanded several times that the town council order the demolition of those old walls, ‘relics of the past’. At the same time, the most freethinking among them feel a thrill of delight whenever a marquis or a count deigns to honour them with a nod. Indeed, the dream of every bourgeois in the new town is to be admitted to one of the drawing-rooms in the Saint-Marc district.

"Puis, comme malgré elle, au milieu de ses larmes :","Then, as if in spite of herself, in the midst of her tears:","Then in spite of herself, as it were, she continued amidst her tears: “Ah!","Then, in spite of herself, as it were, she went on, still sobbing:"
"Jamais Miette n’avait entendu dire du bien de son père. On le traitait ordinairement devant elle de gueux, de scélérat, et voilà qu’elle rencontrait de braves cœurs qui avaient pour lui des paroles de pardon et qui le déclaraient un honnête homme. Alors elle fondit en larmes, elle retrouva l’émotion que la Marseillaise avait fait monter à sa gorge, elle chercha comment elle pourrait remercier ces hommes doux aux malheureux. Un moment, il lui vint l’idée de leur serrer la main à tous, comme un garçon. Mais son cœur trouva mieux. À côté d’elle se tenait debout l’insurgé qui portait le drapeau. Elle toucha la hampe du drapeau et, pour tout remerciement, elle dit d’une voix suppliante :","Miette had never heard good things about her father. He was usually treated before her as a beggar, a scoundrel, and now she met brave hearts who had words of forgiveness for him and who declared him an honest man. So she burst into tears, she rediscovered the emotion that the Marseillaise had made rise in her throat, she looked for how she could thank these gentle men to the unfortunate. For a moment it occurred to him to shake hands with all of them, like a boy. But his heart found better. Next to her stood the insurgent who carried the flag. She touched the pole of the flag and, for all thanks, she said in a pleading voice:","Miette had never before heard anyone speak well of her father. He was generally referred to as a beggar, a villain, and now she found good fellows who had forgiving words for him, and declared him to be an honest man. She burst into tears, again full of the emotion awakened in her by the “Marseillaise;” and she bethought herself how she might thank these men for their kindness to her in misfortune. For a moment she conceived the idea of shaking them all by the hand like a man. But her heart suggested something better. By her side stood the insurgent who carried the banner. She touched the staff, and, to express her gratitude, said in an entreating tone, “Give it to me; I will carry it.”","This was the first time Miette had heard anyone speak well of her father.

"« Est-ce que je suis de votre famille ! continua le jeune homme. Vous m’avez toujours renié… Aujourd’hui, la peur vous a poussé ici, parce que vous sentez bien que le jour de la justice est venu.

"Rougon maugréait. Il sentait la peur le reprendre. Les cheveux de Granoux achevèrent de blanchir. L’aube parut enfin avec des lenteurs mortelles. Ce fut encore un bien mauvais moment. Ces messieurs, au premier rayon, s’attendaient à voir une armée rangée en bataille devant la ville. Justement, ce matin-là, le jour avait des paresses, se traînait au bord de l’horizon. Le cou tendu, l’œil en arrêt, ils interrogeaient les blancheurs vagues. Et, dans l’ombre indécise, ils entrevoyaient des profils monstrueux, la plaine se changeait en lac de sang, les rochers en cadavres flottant à la surface, les bouquets d’arbres en bataillons encore menaçants et debout. Puis, lorsque les clartés croissantes eurent effacé ces fantômes, le jour se leva, si pâle, si triste, avec des mélancolies telles, que le marquis lui-même eut le cœur serré. On n’apercevait point d’insurgés, les routes étaient libres ; mais la vallée, toute grise, avait un aspect désert et morne de coupe-gorge. Les feux étaient éteints, les cloches sonnaient encore. Vers huit heures, Rougon distingua seulement une bande de quelques hommes qui s’éloignaient le long de la Viorne.","Rougon grumbled. He felt fear take hold of him. Granoux's hair finished turning white. Dawn finally appeared with deadly slowness. It was still a very bad moment. These gentlemen, at first sight, expected to see an army arrayed in battle array in front of the town. Precisely, that morning, the day was lazy, dragged along the edge of the horizon. Necks outstretched, eyes fixed, they questioned the vague whiteness. And, in the uncertain shadow, they glimpsed monstrous profiles, the plain changed into a lake of blood, the rocks into corpses floating on the surface, the clumps of trees into battalions still threatening and standing. Then, when the increasing light had effaced these phantoms, day broke, so pale, so sad, with such melancholy, that the Marquis himself felt heartbroken. No insurgents were seen, the roads were free; but the valley, all gray, looked deserted and gloomy like a cut-throat. The fires were out, the bells were still ringing. About eight o'clock Rougon could only make out a band of a few men moving away along the Viorne.","Meanwhile Rougon cursed and swore. He felt himself again giving way to fear. As for Granoux, his hair turned completely white. At last the dawn appeared with weary slowness. This again was a terribly anxious moment. The gentlemen, at the first ray of light, expected to see an army drawn up in line before the town. It so happened that day that the dawn was lazy and lingered awhile on the edge of the horizon. With outstretched necks and fixed gaze, the party on the terrace peered anxiously into the misty expanse. In the uncertain light they fancied they caught glimpses of colossal profiles, the plain seemed to be transformed into a lake of blood, the rocks looked like corpses floating on its surface, and the clusters of trees took the forms of battalions drawn up and threatening attack. When the growing light had at last dispersed these phantoms, the morning broke so pale, so mournful, so melancholy, that even the marquis’s spirits sank. Not a single insurgent was to be seen, and the high roads were free; but the grey valley wore a gruesomely sad and deserted aspect. The fires had now gone out, but the bells still rang on. Towards eight o’clock, Rougon observed a small party of men who were moving off along the Viorne.","’ Meanwhile Rougon fumed and swore. He felt himself giving way to fear once more. And Granoux’s hair turned completely white. At last the dawn began to appear, with tantalizing slowness. This was, again, a very anxious moment. The councillors, at the first ray of light, expected to see an army drawn up before the town. It so happened that, that morning, the dawn was lazy and lingered for a while on the edge of the horizon.

"Un jour, la poulie se fendit. Le jeune charron tailla lui-même une belle et forte poulie de chêne qu’il posa le soir, après sa journée. Il lui fallut monter sur le mur. Quand il eut fini son travail, il resta à califourchon sur le chaperon du mur, se reposant, regardant curieusement la large étendue du Jas-Meiffren. Une paysanne qui arrachait les mauvaises herbes à quelques pas de lui finit par fixer son attention. On était en juillet, l’air brûlait, bien que le soleil fût déjà au bord de l’horizon. La paysanne avait retiré sa casaque. En corset blanc, un fichu de couleur noué sur les épaules, les manches de chemise retroussées jusqu’aux coudes, elle était accroupie dans les plis de sa jupe de cotonnade bleue, que retenaient deux bretelles croisées derrière le dos. Elle marchait sur les genoux, arrachant activement l’ivraie qu’elle jetait dans un couffin. Le jeune homme ne voyait d’elle que ses bras nus, brûlés par le soleil, s’allongeant à droite, à gauche, pour saisir quelque herbe oubliée. Il suivait complaisamment ce jeu rapide des bras de la paysanne, goûtant un singulier plaisir à les voir si fermes et si prompts. Elle s’était légèrement redressée en ne l’entendant plus travailler, et avait baissé de nouveau la tête, avant qu’il eût pu même distinguer ses traits. Ce mouvement effarouché le retint. Il se questionnait sur cette femme, en garçon curieux, sifflant machinalement et battant la mesure avec un ciseau à froid qu’il tenait à la main, lorsque le ciseau lui échappa. L’outil tomba du côté du Jas-Meiffren, sur la margelle du puits, et alla rebondir à quelques pas de la muraille. Silvère le regarda, se penchant, hésitant à descendre. Mais il paraît que la paysanne examinait le jeune homme du coin de l’œil, car elle se leva sans mot dire, et vint ramasser le ciseau à froid qu’elle tendit à Silvère. Alors ce dernier vit que la paysanne était une enfant. Il resta surpris et un peu intimidé. Dans les clartés rouges du couchant, la jeune fille se haussait vers lui. Le mur, à cet endroit, était bas, mais la hauteur se trouvait encore trop grande. Silvère se coucha sur le chaperon, la petite paysanne se dressa sur la pointe des pieds. Ils ne disaient rien, ils se regardaient d’un air confus et souriant. Le jeune homme eût, d’ailleurs, voulu prolonger l’attitude de l’enfant. Elle levait vers lui une adorable tête, de grands yeux noirs, une bouche rouge, qui l’étonnaient et le remuaient singulièrement. Jamais il n’avait vu une fille de si près ; il ignorait qu’une bouche et des yeux pussent être si plaisants à regarder. Tout lui paraissait avoir un charme inconnu, le fichu de couleur, le corset blanc, la jupe de cotonnade bleue, que tiraient les bretelles, tendues par le mouvement des épaules. Son regard glissa le long du bras qui lui présentait l’outil ; jusqu’au coude, le bras était d’un brun doré, comme vêtu de hâle ; mais plus loin, dans l’ombre de la manche de chemise retroussée, Silvère apercevait une rondeur nue, d’une blancheur de lait. Il se troubla, se pencha davantage, et put enfin saisir le ciseau. La petite paysanne commençait à être embarrassée. Puis ils restèrent là, à se sourire encore, l’enfant en bas, la face toujours levée, le jeune garçon à demi couché sur le chaperon du mur. Ils ne savaient comment se séparer. Ils n’avaient pas échangé une parole. Silvère oubliait même de dire merci.","One day, the pulley split. The young wheelwright carved himself a beautiful and strong oak pulley which he placed in the evening, after his day's work. He had to climb up the wall. When he had finished his work, he remained astride the coping of the wall, resting, gazing curiously at the wide expanse of Jas-Meiffren. A peasant woman who was pulling weeds a few steps from him finally caught his attention. It was July, the air was burning, although the sun was already at the edge of the horizon. The peasant woman had taken off her gown. In a white corset, a colored fichu tied on the shoulders, the shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows, she was squatting in the folds of her blue cotton skirt, held up by two straps crossed behind her back. She walked on her knees, actively pulling up the chaff and throwing it into a basket. The young man saw of her only her bare arms, scorched by the sun, stretching out to the right, to the left, to seize some forgotten grass. He followed complacently this rapid play of the arms of the peasant woman, tasting a singular pleasure in seeing them so firm and so prompt. She straightened up slightly when she no longer heard him working, and lowered her head again before he could even make out her features. This frightened movement restrained him. He was wondering about this woman, like a curious boy, whistling mechanically and beating time with a cold chisel he was holding in his hand, when the chisel slipped from his grasp. The tool fell on the Jas-Meiffren side, on the edge of the well, and bounced a few paces from the wall. Silvere looked at him, leaning forward, hesitating to come down. But it seems that the peasant woman was examining the young man out of the corner of her eye, for she got up without saying a word and went to pick up the cold chisel which she handed to Silvere. Then the latter saw that the peasant was a child. He remained surprised and a little intimidated. In the red light of the setting sun, the young girl rose towards him. The wall at this point was low, but the height was still too great. Silvere lay down on the hood, the little peasant girl rose on tiptoe. They said nothing, they looked at each other with a confused and smiling air. The young man, moreover, would have liked to prolong the attitude of the child. She raised an adorable head towards him, large black eyes, a red mouth, which astonished him and moved him singularly. He had never seen a girl so close before; he did not know that a mouth and eyes could be so pleasant to look at. Everything seemed to her to have an unknown charm, the colored fichu, the white corset, the blue cotton skirt, which the suspenders held tight, stretched by the movement of the shoulders. His gaze slid along the arm that offered him the tool; up to the elbow the arm was golden brown, as if clothed in suntan; but farther on, in the shadow of the rolled-up shirt sleeve, Silvere could see a bare roundness, as white as milk. He became confused, leaned further, and was finally able to grasp the chisel. The little peasant girl was beginning to be embarrassed. Then they remained there, still smiling at each other, the child below, his face still raised, the young boy half lying on the coping on the wall. They didn't know how to separate. They had not exchanged a word. Silvere even forgot to say thank you.","One day the pulley broke. The young wheelwright made a good strong one of oak, and put it up in the evening after his day’s work. To do this he had to climb upon the wall. When he had finished the job he remained resting astride the coping, and surveyed with curiosity the large expanse of the Jas-Meiffren. At last a peasant-girl, who was weeding the ground a few feet from him, attracted his attention. It was in July, and the air was broiling, although the sun had already sank to the horizon. The peasant-girl had taken off her jacket. In a white bodice, with a coloured neckerchief tied over her shoulders, and the sleeves of her chemise turned up as far as her elbows, she was squatting amid the folds of her blue cotton skirt, which was secured to a pair of braces crossed behind her back. She crawled about on her knees as she pulled up the tares and threw them into a basket. The young man could only see her bare, sun-tanned arms stretching out right and left to seize some overlooked weed. He followed this rapid play of her arms complacently, deriving a singular pleasure from seeing them so firm and quick. The young person had slightly raised herself on noticing that he was no longer at work, but had again lowered her head before he could distinguish her features. This shyness kept him in suspense. Like an inquisitive lad he wondered who this weeder could be, and while he lingered there, whistling and beating time with a chisel, the latter suddenly slipped out of his hand. It fell into the Jas-Meiffren, striking the curb of the well, and then bounding a few feet from the wall. Silvère looked at it, leaning forward and hesitating to get over. But the peasant-girl must have been watching the young man askance, for she jumped up without saying anything, picked up the chisel, and handed it to Silvère, who then perceived that she was a mere child. He was surprised and rather intimidated. The young girl raised herself towards him in the red glare of the sunset. The wall at this spot was low, but nevertheless too high for her to reach him. So he bent low over the coping, while she still raised herself on tiptoes. They did not speak, but looked at each other with an air of smiling confusion. The young man would indeed have liked to keep the girl in that position. She turned to him a charming head, with handsome black eyes, and red lips, which quite astonished and stirred him. He had never before seen a girl so near; he had not known that lips and eyes could be so pleasant to look at. Everything about the girl seemed to possess a strange fascination for him—her coloured neckerchief, her white bodice, her blue cotton skirt hanging from braces which stretched with the motion of her shoulders. Then his glance glided along the arm which was handing him the tool; as far as the elbow this arm was of a golden brown, as though clothed with sun-burn; but higher up, in the shadow of the tucked-up sleeve, Silvère perceived a bare, milk-white roundness. At this he felt confused; however, he leant further over, and at last managed to grasp the chisel. The little peasant-girl was becoming embarrassed. Still they remained there, smiling at each other, the child beneath with upturned face, and the lad half reclining on the coping of the wall. They could not part from each other. So far they had not exchanged a word, and Silvère even forgot to say, “Thank you.”","One day the pulley broke. The young cartwright made a good strong one of oak and put it up in the evening after his day’s work. To do this he had to climb up on the wall. When he had finished the job he remained for a while astride the coping, surveying with great curiosity the large expanse of the Jas-Meiffren. At last a peasant girl, who was doing some weeding a few yards away, caught his attention. It was July, and very hot, though the sun was already going down. The girl had taken off her overblouse. In a white bodice, with a coloured neckerchief tied over her shoulders, and the sleeves of her chemise rolled up to her elbows, she was squatting amid the folds of her blue cotton skirt, which was held up by a pair of braces crossed behind her back. She was crawling about on her knees pulling up the tufts of rye grass and throwing them into a basket. The young man could only see her bare, sun-tanned arms stretching out right and left to tear up a weed she had missed. He watched her rapid movements, deriving a strange feeling of pleasure to see her arms so firm and quick. The girl had looked up for a moment when she had noticed that he had stopped working, but had lowered her head again before he could see her face properly. This shyness intrigued him. Being inquisitive, he wondered who this young woman could be, and lingered there, whistling tunelessly and beating time with a chisel; suddenly the chisel slipped out of his hand and fell into the Jas-Meiffren, hitting the curb of the well and then bouncing a few feet from the wall. Silvère stared at it, leaning forward but not daring to jump down. The peasant girl must have been looking at him out of the corner of her eye, for she jumped up without a word, picked up the chisel, and handed it to him. He could now see that she was no more than a child. He was surprised and rather intimidated. The young girl stretched up towards him in the red glare of the sunset. The wall at this point was quite low, but still too high for her to reach him. So he lay down on top of the wall while she stood on tiptoe. They did not speak, but looked shyly at each other, smiling. The young man found her very striking like that, with her upturned face, black eyes, and red lips. He had never seen a girl so close; he did not know that lips and eyes could be so pleasant to look at. Everything about the girl fascinated him— her coloured neckerchief, her white bodice, her blue cotton skirt held up by braces that stretched when she moved her shoulders. Then his eyes glided along the arm that was handing him the tool; up to the elbow the arm was golden brown, as if clothed with suntan; but higher up, in the shadow of the rolled-up sleeve, Silvère could see bare, milk-white skin. He became embarrassed, but bent down further and took hold of the chisel. The little peasant girl was also becoming embarrassed. They remained there, smiling at each other, the child looking up from below, the lad stretched out on the coping of the wall. They seemed unable to separate. They had not exchanged a word, and Silvère had even forgotten to thank her."
"Mais, avec des entêtements de fille, Miette voulait qu’il descendît le premier ; elle désirait le voir s’en aller. Et, comme le jeune homme tenait bon, elle finissait par dire brusquement, pour le punir, sans doute :","But, with the stubbornness of a girl, Miette wanted him to get off first; she wanted to see him go. And, as the young man held firm, she ended by saying abruptly, to punish him no doubt:","But Miette, with a girl’s waywardness, wished him to descend first; she wanted to see him go away. And as he persisted in remaining, she ended by saying abruptly, by way of punishment, perhaps: “Look!","But Miette, with all the stubbornness of a young girl, wanted him to get down first; she wanted to see him go away.

Et jetant un coup d’œil sur les fenêtres où les têtes s’entassaient :,And glancing at the windows where heads were piled up:,"And casting a glance at the windows, where groups of people were congregated, she added: “How wild they must be!","Casting a glance at the other windows, where all her neighbours were gathered, she said:"
"Un dimanche soir, vers sept heures, un jeune homme sortit doucement de l’impasse Saint-Mittre, et, rasant les murs, s’engagea parmi les poutres du chantier. On était dans les premiers jours de décembre 1851. Il faisait un froid sec. La lune, pleine en ce moment, avait ces clartés aiguës particulières aux lunes d’hiver. Le chantier, cette nuit-là, ne se creusait pas sinistrement comme par les nuits pluvieuses ; éclairé de larges nappes de lumière blanche, il s’étendait dans le silence et l’immobilité du froid, avec une mélancolie douce.","One Sunday evening, around seven o'clock, a young man quietly left the impasse Saint-Mittre, and, skimming the walls, entered among the beams of the building site. It was the first days of December 1851. It was freezing cold. The moon, full at this moment, had those sharp lights peculiar to winter moons. The building site, that night, was not sinking sinisterly as on rainy nights; Illuminated by wide sheets of white light, it stretched out in the silence and stillness of the cold, with a gentle melancholy.","One Sunday evening, at about seven o’clock, a young man stepped lightly from the Impasse Saint-Mittre, and, closely skirting the walls, took his way among the timber in the wood-yard. It was in the early part of December, 1851. The weather was dry and cold. The full moon shone with that sharp brilliancy peculiar to winter moons. The wood-yard did not have the forbidding appearance which it wears on rainy nights; illumined by stretches of white light, and wrapped in deep and chilly silence, it spread around with a soft, melancholy aspect.","One Sunday evening, at about seven o’clock, a young man stepped lightly out of the Impasse Saint-Mittre and, hugging the wall, picked his way through the timber in the woodyard. It was at the beginning of December 1851. The weather was dry and cold. The full moon shone with the sharp brilliance of winter moons. That night the yard was not some vast yawning space, as it seemed on rainy nights; illuminated by large patches of white light, and wrapped in a deep, chilly silence, it stretched out, soft and melancholy."
"Miette pensait qu’elle n’aurait peut-être pas de longtemps la joie d’un rendez-vous, d’une de ces causeries du soir, pour lesquelles elle vivait les journées.","Miette thought that she would perhaps not have the joy of a rendezvous for long, of one of those evening chats for which she lived the days.","Miette reflected that for a long time she would probably not have the pleasure of another meeting—another of those evening chats, the joy of which served to sustain her all day long.","Miette was thinking that it would be a long time before she had the pleasure of another rendezvous, another of their evening conversations, which she looked forward to all day long."
"« Eh ! grande bête, dit-elle, tant mieux, si le préfet nous oublie ! Nous sauverons la ville à nous tout seuls. Moi je voudrais voir revenir les insurgés, pour les recevoir à coups de fusil et nous couvrir de gloire… Écoute, tu vas fermer les portes de la ville, puis tu ne te coucheras pas ; tu te donneras beaucoup de mouvement toute la nuit ; ça te sera compté plus tard. »","“Hey! big beast, she said, so much the better if the prefect forgets us! We will save the city single-handedly. I would like to see the insurgents return, to receive them with gunshots and cover us with glory… Listen, you are going to close the gates of the city, then you will not go to bed; you will give yourself a lot of movement all night long; it will be counted to you later. »","“Well, you great simpleton,” she said, “so much the better, if the prefect does forget us! We shall save the town by ourselves. For my part, I should like to see the insurgents return, so that we might receive them with bullets and cover ourselves with glory. Listen to me, go and have the gates closed, and don’t go to bed; bustle about all night; it will all be taken into account later on.”","‘Well, you fool,’ she said, ‘so much the better if the prefect has forgotten us!

"« Tiens, lis », reprit-il, en tendant le journal à Félicité.","“Here, read,” he went on, handing the newspaper to Félicité.","“Here, read,” he resumed, handing the paper to Félicité.","‘Here, read this,’ he said, handing the paper to Félicité."
"Elle sortit, avec ses allures lestes, et courut à l’hôtel des postes. Elle entra brusquement dans le cabinet où Vuillet travaillait encore.

"Miette et Silvère restèrent longtemps muets. Ils lisaient dans leurs pensées inquiètes. Et, à mesure qu’ils descendaient ensemble dans la crainte et l’inconnu du lendemain, ils se serraient d’une étreinte plus étroite.

After a while, however, Miette could no longer contain herself; choking with emotion, she expressed in a single phrase what was preying on their minds."
"Cependant Macquart, reprenant son ancienne tactique, cherchait des complices contre les Rougon, dans la famille même. Il avait d’abord compté sur Aristide, en lisant ses terribles articles de l’Indépendant. Mais le jeune homme, bien qu’aveuglé par ses rages jalouses, n’était point assez sot pour faire cause commune avec un homme tel que son oncle. Il ne prit même pas la peine de le ménager et le tint toujours à distance, ce qui le fit traiter de suspect par Antoine ; dans les estaminets où régnait ce dernier, on alla jusqu’à dire que le journaliste était un agent provocateur. Battu de ce côté, Macquart n’avait plus qu’à sonder les enfants de sa sœur Ursule.","Meanwhile Macquart, resuming his old tactic, sought accomplices against the Rougons, in the family itself. He had first counted on Aristide, reading his terrible articles in the Independent. But the young man, though blinded by his jealous rages, was not so foolish as to make common cause with such a man as his uncle. He didn't even bother to spare him and always kept him at a distance, which made Antoine treat him as a suspect; in the taverns where the latter reigned, people went so far as to say that the journalist was an agent provocateur. Beaten on this side, Macquart had only to sound out the children of his sister Ursule.","In the meantime, Macquart, resorting to his former tactics, looked round among his own relatives for accomplices who would join him against the Rougons. He had counted upon Aristide at first, on reading his terrible articles in the “Indépendant.” But the young man, in spite of all his jealous rage, was not so foolish as to make common cause with such a fellow as his uncle. He never even minced matters with him, but invariably kept him at a distance, a circumstance which induced Antoine to regard him suspiciously. In the taverns, where Macquart reigned supreme, people went so far as to say the journalist was paid to provoke disturbances. Baffled on this side, Macquart had no alternative but to sound his sister Ursule’s children.","In the meantime Macquart, resorting to his former tactics, looked round among his own relatives for accomplices who would join forces with him against the Rougons.

"Cette allusion à la bande insurrectionnelle fit passer un frisson dans le dos des vainqueurs. Rougon surtout éprouva un léger étranglement. Son frère, qui était exaspéré d’avoir été surpris comme un enfant par ces bourgeois effarés, qu’il traitait d’abominables pékins, à titre d’ancien soldat, le regardait, le bravait avec des yeux luisants de haine.","This allusion to the insurrectionary band sent a shiver down the backs of the victors.

"Pierre se débarrassa d’Ursule d’une façon encore plus inattendue. Un ouvrier chapelier du faubourg, nommé Mouret, se prit d’une belle tendresse pour la jeune fille, qu’il trouvait frêle et blanche comme une demoiselle du quartier Saint-Marc. Il l’épousa. Ce fut de sa part un mariage d’amour, un véritable coup de tête, sans calcul aucun. Quant à Ursule, elle accepta ce mariage pour fuir une maison où son frère aîné lui rendait la vie intolérable. Sa mère, enfoncée dans ses jouissances, mettant ses dernières énergies à se défendre elle-même, en était arrivée à une indifférence complète ; elle fut même heureuse de son départ, espérant que Pierre, n’ayant plus aucun sujet de mécontentement, la laisserait vivre en paix, à sa guise. Dès que les jeunes gens furent mariés, Mouret comprit qu’il devait quitter Plassans, s’il ne voulait entendre chaque jour des paroles désobligeantes sur sa femme et sur sa belle-mère. Il partit, il emmena Ursule à Marseille, où il travailla de son état. D’ailleurs, il n’avait pas demandé un sou de dot. Comme Pierre, surpris de ce désintéressement, s’était mis à balbutier, cherchant à lui donner des explications, il lui avait fermé la bouche en disant qu’il préférait gagner le pain de sa femme. Le digne fils du paysan Rougon demeura inquiet ; cette façon d’agir lui sembla cacher quelque piège.","Pierre got rid of Ursule in an even more unexpected way. A workman hatter from the faubourg, named Mouret, felt a great tenderness for the young girl, whom he found as frail and white as a young lady from the Saint-Marc quarter. He married her. It was a marriage of love on his part, a real whim, without any calculation. As for Ursule, she accepted this marriage to flee a house where her elder brother was making life intolerable for her. His mother, sunk in her pleasures, putting her last energies into defending herself, had arrived at complete indifference; she was even happy to be gone, hoping that Pierre, having no longer any cause for discontent, would let her live in peace, as she pleased. As soon as the young people were married, Mouret understood that he had to leave Plassans, if he did not want to hear every day derogatory words about his wife and his mother-in-law. He left, he took Ursule to Marseilles, where he worked as he was. Besides, he had not asked for a penny of dowry. As Pierre, surprised at this disinterestedness, had begun to stammer, trying to give him an explanation, he had closed his mouth, saying that he preferred to earn his wife's bread.

"Cependant Macquart avait passé la journée chez tante Dide. Il s’était allongé sur le vieux coffre, en regrettant le divan de M. Garçonnet. À plusieurs reprises, il eut une envie folle d’aller écorner ses deux cents francs dans quelque café voisin ; cet argent, qu’il avait mis dans une des poches de son gilet, lui brûlait le flanc ; il employa le temps à le dépenser en imagination. Sa mère, chez laquelle, depuis quelques jours, ses enfants accouraient, éperdus, la mine pâle, sans qu’elle sortît de son silence, sans que sa figure perdît son immobilité morte, tourna autour de lui, avec ses mouvements roides d’automate, ne paraissant même pas s’apercevoir de sa présence. Elle ignorait les peurs qui bouleversaient la ville close ; elle était à mille lieues de Plassans, montée dans cette continuelle idée fixe qui tenait ses yeux ouverts, vides de pensée. À cette heure, pourtant, une inquiétude, un souci humain faisait par instants battre ses paupières. Antoine, ne pouvant résister au désir de manger un bon morceau, l’envoya chercher un poulet rôti chez un traiteur du faubourg. Quand il fut attablé :","However Macquart had spent the day with Aunt Dide. He had stretched himself out on the old chest, longing for M. Garçonnet's divan. On several occasions he had a mad desire to go and chip away at his two hundred francs in some nearby cafe; this money, which he had put in one of the pockets of his waistcoat, burned his side; he employed the time in spending it in imagination. His mother, to whose house, for several days, her children had been rushing, distraught, with a pale face, without her breaking her silence, without her face losing its dead immobility, circled around him, with her stiff movements of an automaton , not even seeming to notice his presence. She was unaware of the fears that upset the walled city; she was a thousand leagues from Plassans, mounted in this continual fixed idea which kept her eyes open, empty of thought. At this hour, however, an anxiety, a human concern made his eyelids flutter at times. Antoine, unable to resist the desire to have a good bite to eat, sent him to fetch a roast chicken from a caterer in the faubourg.

Now and again, however, at this particular moment, some feeling of uneasiness, some human anxiety, occasionally made her blink. Antoine, unable to resist the temptation of having something nice to eat, sent her to get a roast chicken from an eating-house in the Faubourg. When it was set on the table: “Hey!”","In the meantime Macquart had spent the day at Aunt Dide’s house. Stretched out on the old chest, lamenting the loss of Monsieur Garçonnet’s sofa, he had felt several times a mad desire to break into his two hundred francs at some neighbouring café. The money was burning a hole in his waistcoat pocket; however, he whiled away his time by spending it in his imagination. His mother moved about the shack in her stiff, mechanical way, as if she were not even aware of his presence; during the last few days her children had been coming to her rather frequently, pale and in a state of desperation, but she did not become less taciturn nor did her expression become less impassive. She knew nothing of the fear that was creating such havoc in the town; she was a thousand miles away from Plassans, gripped by the constant obsession that gave her eyes such a blank look. Now and again, however, a feeling of anxiety occasionally made her blink. Antoine, unable to resist the temptation of having something nice to eat, sent her out to get a roast chicken. When he was seated at the table he said:"
"« S’ils ne me le tuent pas, ils le feront prisonnier, poursuivit-elle, en regardant son mari fixement. Mon Dieu ! que deviendrai-je, seule, dans une ville abandonnée !","""If they don't kill him for me, they'll take him prisoner,"" she continued, staring at her husband. My God ! what will become of me, alone, in an abandoned town!","“If they don’t kill him, they’ll make him a prisoner,” she continued, looked fixedly at her husband. “Good heavens! What will become of me, left alone in an abandoned town?”","‘If they don’t kill him, they’ll take him prisoner,’ she went on, staring at her husband. ‘ My God! What would I do, left alone in an empty town?’"
"Mais les journées du 5 et du 6 furent plus inquiétantes. On apprit successivement l’insurrection des petites villes voisines ; tout le sud du département prenait les armes ; la Palud et Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx s’étaient soulevés les premiers, entraînant à leur suite les villages, Chavanoz, Nazères, Poujols, Valqueyras, Vernoux. Alors le salon jaune commença à être sérieusement pris de panique. Ce qui l’inquiétait surtout, c’était de sentir Plassans isolé au sein même de la révolte. Des bandes d’insurgés devaient battre les campagnes et interrompre toute communication. Granoux répétait d’un air effaré que M. le maire était sans nouvelles. Et des gens commençaient à dire que le sang coulait à Marseille et qu’une formidable révolution avait éclaté à Paris. Le commandant Sicardot, furieux de la poltronnerie des bourgeois, parlait de mourir à la tête de ses hommes.","But the days of the 5th and 6th were more worrying. We learned successively of the insurrection of the small neighboring towns; all the south of the department took up arms; La Palud and Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx were the first to rise, dragging the villages of Chavanoz, Nazères, Poujols, Valqueyras, Vernoux with them. Then the yellow living room began to be seriously panicked. What worried him above all was to feel Plassans isolated in the very heart of the revolt. Bands of insurgents were to scour the countryside and cut off all communication. Granoux repeated with a frightened air that the mayor had no news. And people were starting to say that blood was flowing in Marseilles and that a tremendous revolution had broken out in Paris. Commander Sicardot, furious at the cowardice of the bourgeois, spoke of dying at the head of his men.","The 5th and 6th were, however, more disquieting. Intelligence was received of successive risings in small neighbouring towns; the whole southern part of the department had taken up arms; La Palud and Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx had been the first to rise, drawing after them the villages of Chavanos, Nazeres, Poujols, Valqueyras and Vernoux. The yellow drawing-room party was now becoming seriously alarmed. It felt particularly uneasy at seeing Plassans isolated in the very midst of the revolt. Bands of insurgents would certainly scour the country and cut off all communications. Granoux announced, with a terrified look, that the mayor was without any news. Some people even asserted that blood had been shed at Marseilles, and that a formidable revolution had broken out in Paris. Commander Sicardot, enraged at the cowardice of the bourgeois, vowed he would die at the head of his men.","The fifth and sixth days, however, were more disquieting. News was received of successive uprisings in small neighbouring towns; the whole southern part of the department had taken up arms; La Palud and Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx had been the first to rise up, followed by the villages of Chavanoz, Nazières, Poujols, Valqueyras, and Vernoux. The yellow drawing-room became seriously alarmed. It felt particularly uneasy at seeing Plassans isolated in the midst of this revolt. Bands of insurgents would be bound to roam the countryside and cut off all communication. Granoux, looking very worried, kept repeating that the mayor had heard nothing. Some people began to say that there was violent fighting in Marseilles, and that a terrible revolution had broken out in Paris. Commander Sicardot, angered by the cowardice of the bourgeois, vowed that he would die at the head of his men."
"Et, en effet, un quart d’heure suffit, au bout duquel Granoux lut, d’une voix émue :","And, indeed, a quarter of an hour is enough, at the end of which Granoux read, in a moved voice:","And, in fact, a quarter of an hour sufficed for the necessary changes, after which Granoux read out, in an earnest voice: “Inhabitants of Plassans—The hour of resistance has struck, the reign of order has returned——”","A quarter of an hour was all they needed to make the necessary alterations, after which Granoux declaimed:"
"Puis, se penchant davantage, étudiant les traits de plus près, il continua à voix basse, comme se parlant à lui-même.","Then, leaning closer, studying the features more closely, he continued in a low voice, as if talking to himself.","Then bending over to observe her features more closely, he continued in a whisper, as though speaking to himself: “I have never seen such a face, excepting among people who have been murdered or have died from fright.","Then, bending forward to look at her face even more closely, he continued in a hushed tone, as if talking to himself:"
"D’ailleurs, il voyait sa famille rarement, sans afficher la moindre répugnance, obéissant malgré lui à ses instincts particuliers. Avant qu’Aristide fût entré à la sous-préfecture, il vint plusieurs fois à son secours. Il était resté garçon. Il ne se douta seulement pas des graves événements qui se préparaient. Depuis deux ou trois ans, il s’occupait du grand problème de l’hérédité, comparant les races animales à la race humaine, et il s’absorbait dans les curieux résultats qu’il obtenait. Les observations qu’il avait faites sur lui et sur sa famille avaient été comme le point de départ de ses études. Le peuple comprenait si bien, avec son intuition inconsciente, à quel point il différait des Rougon, qu’il le nommait M. Pascal, sans jamais ajouter son nom de famille.","Besides, he rarely saw his family, without displaying the slightest repugnance, obeying in spite of himself his particular instincts. Before Aristide entered the sub-prefecture, he came to his aid several times. He had remained a boy. He simply had no idea of the serious events that were preparing. For two or three years he had occupied himself with the great problem of heredity, comparing the animal races with the human race, and he was absorbed in the curious results which he obtained. The observations he had made about himself and his family had been the starting point for his studies. The people understood so well, with their unconscious intuition, how much he differed from the Rougons, that they called him M. Pascal, without ever adding his surname.","Moreover, though he never displayed any repugnance to his relatives, he very rarely saw them, following in this wise his natural instincts. Before Aristide obtained a situation at the Sub-Prefecture, Pascal had frequently come to his assistance. For his part he had remained a bachelor. He had not the least suspicion of the grave events that were preparing. For two or three years he had been studying the great problem of heredity, comparing the human and animal races together, and becoming absorbed in the strange results which he obtained. Certain observations which he had made with respect to himself and his relatives had been, so to say, the starting-point of his studies. The common people, with their natural intuition, so well understood that he was quite different from the other Rougons, that they invariably called him Monsieur Pascal, without ever adding his family name.","Moreover, while he never showed any antipathy towards his family, he rarely saw them, simply following his natural instincts. Before Aristide got his position at the sub-prefecture, Pascal had often helped him out. Unlike Aristide, he had remained unmarried. He did not have the least suspicion of the momentous events that were about to unfold. For two or three years, he had been studying the great problem of heredity, comparing the human and animal species with each other, fascinated by the strange results he obtained. Certain observations he had made with respect to himself and his family had formed the basis of his investigations. Ordinary working people, with their natural intuition, understood so well how different he was from the other Rougons that they always called him Monsieur Pascal, never adding his family name."

"À ce moment, on vit circuler Aristide parmi les groupes. Le cher garçon, devant ce soulèvement formidable, avait pensé qu’il était imprudent de ne pas rester l’ami des républicains ; mais comme, d’un autre côté, il ne voulait pas trop se compromettre avec eux, il était venu leur faire ses adieux, le bras en écharpe, en se plaignant amèrement de cette maudite blessure qui l’empêchait de tenir une arme. Il rencontra dans la foule son frère Pascal, muni d’une trousse et d’une petite caisse de secours. Le médecin lui annonça, de sa voix tranquille, qu’il allait suivre les insurgés. Aristide le traita tout bas de grand innocent. Il finit par s’esquiver, craignant qu’on ne lui confiât la garde de la ville, poste qu’il jugeait singulièrement périlleux.","At this moment, Aristide was seen circulating among the groups. The dear fellow, faced with this formidable uprising, had thought it imprudent not to remain the friend of the Republicans; but as, on the other hand, he did not wish to compromise himself too much with them, he had come to bid them farewell, his arm in a sling, complaining bitterly of that accursed wound which prevented him from holding a weapon. He met his brother Pascal in the crowd, armed with a kit and a small emergency box. The doctor told him, in his calm voice, that he was going to follow the insurgents. Aristide called him a great innocent. He ended up slipping away, fearing that he would be entrusted with guarding the city, a position he considered singularly perilous.","At this moment Aristide was observed walking about among the groups. In presence of this formidable rising, the dear fellow had thought it imprudent not to remain on friendly terms with the Republicans; but as, on the other hand, he did not desire to compromise himself too much, he had come to bid them farewell with his arm in a sling, complaining bitterly of the accursed injury which prevented him from carrying a weapon. As he walked through the crowd he came across his brother Pascal, provided with a case of surgical instruments and a little portable medicine chest. The doctor informed him, in his quiet, way, that he intended to follow the insurgents. At this Aristide inwardly pronounced him a great fool. At last he himself slunk away, fearing lest the others should entrust the care of the town to him, a post which he deemed exceptionally perilous.","At this moment Aristide was seen walking about among the groups.

"« La petite a raison, dit-il. Chantegreil était un des nôtres. Je l’ai connu. Jamais on n’a bien vu clair dans son affaire. Moi, j’ai toujours cru à la vérité de ses déclarations devant les juges. Le gendarme qu’il a descendu, à la chasse, d’un coup de fusil, devait déjà le tenir lui-même au bout de sa carabine. On se défend, que voulez-vous ! Mais Chantegreil était un honnête homme, Chantegreil n’a pas volé. »","""The little one is right,"" he said. Chantegreil was one of us. I knew him. We have never seen clearly in his case. I have always believed in the truth of his statements before the judges. The gendarme he shot down, while hunting, with a shotgun blast, must have already held him at the end of his rifle. We defend ourselves, what do you want! But Chantegreil was an honest man, Chantegreil did not steal. »","“The little one’s right,” he said. “Chantegreil was one of us. I knew him. Nobody knows the real facts of his little matter. I always believed in the truth of his deposition before the judge. The gendarme whom he brought down with a bullet, while he was out shooting, was no doubt taking aim at him at the time. A man must defend himself! At all events Chantegreil was a decent fellow; he committed no robbery.”","‘She’s right,’ he said. ‘Chantegreil was one of us. I knew him. Nobody knows what really happened. I always believed what he told the tribunal. The gendarme he shot while he was hunting was probably taking aim at him. A man’s got to defend himself! In any case Chantegreil was a decent man; he wasn’t a thief.’"
"« Défends-les ! défends-les ! disait-il en paraissant se calmer. Moi, en somme, je me suis arrangé de façon à ne plus avoir affaire à eux. Ce que je t’en dis, c’est par tendresse pour ma pauvre mère, que toute cette clique traite vraiment d’une façon révoltante.","“Defend them! defend them! he said, seeming to calm down. Me, in short, I managed to no longer have to do with them. What I'm telling you is out of tenderness for my poor mother, whom all this clique really treats in a revolting way.","“Defend them! Defend them!” he would say, appearing to calm down. “I, for my part, have arranged to have nothing more to do with them. I only mention the matter out of pity for my poor mother, whom all that gang treat in a most revolting manner.”","‘Defend them! Defend them!’ he would say, seeming to calm down. ‘I’ve decided to have nothing more to do with them. I’ve only been saying all this out of pity for my poor mother, whom they treat so revoltingly.’"
"La fusillade, que les Rougon avaient imaginée pour se faire accepter définitivement comme les sauveurs de Plassans, jeta à leurs pieds la ville épouvantée et reconnaissante. Le jour grandit, morne, avec ces mélancolies grises des matinées d’hiver. Les habitants n’entendant plus rien, las de trembler dans leurs draps, se hasardèrent. Il en vint dix à quinze ; puis, le bruit courant que les insurgés avaient pris la fuite, en laissant des morts dans tous les ruisseaux, Plassans entier se leva, descendit sur la place de l’Hôtel-de-Ville. Pendant toute la matinée, les curieux défilèrent autour des quatre cadavres. Ils étaient horriblement mutilés, un surtout, qui avait trois balles dans la tête ; le crâne, soulevé, laissait voir la cervelle à nu. Mais le plus atroce des quatre était le garde national tombé sous le porche ; il avait reçu en pleine figure toute une charge de ce plomb à perdrix dont s’étaient servis les républicains, faute de balles ; sa face trouée, criblée, suait le sang. La foule s’emplit les yeux de cette horreur, longuement, avec cette avidité des poltrons pour les spectacles ignobles. On reconnut le garde national ; c’était le charcutier Dubruel, celui que Roudier accusait, le lundi matin, d’avoir tiré avec une vivacité coupable. Des trois autres morts, deux étaient des ouvriers chapeliers ; le troisième resta inconnu. Et, devant les mares rouges qui tachaient le pavé, des groupes béants frissonnaient, regardant derrière eux d’un air de méfiance, comme si cette justice sommaire qui avait, dans les ténèbres, rétabli l’ordre à coups de fusil, les guettait, épiait leurs gestes et leurs paroles, prête à les fusiller à leur tour, s’ils ne baisaient pas avec enthousiasme la main qui venait de les sauver de la démagogie.","The fusillade, which the Rougons had imagined in order to make themselves definitively accepted as the saviors of Plassans, threw the terrified and grateful town at their feet. The day grows, gloomy, with those gray melancholy of winter mornings. The inhabitants hearing nothing more, tired of trembling in their sheets, ventured. Ten to fifteen came; then, the current report that the insurgents had taken flight, leaving dead in all the gutters, all of Plassans got up, went down to the Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville. Throughout the morning, the curious paraded around the four corpses. They were horribly mutilated, one in particular, who had three bullets in his head; the skull, raised, revealed the bare brain. But the most atrocious of the four was the fallen National Guard on the porch; he had received in the face a whole load of that partridge shot which the republicans had used, for lack of bullets; his holed, riddled face was sweating blood. The crowd fills their eyes with this horror for a long time, with this greed of cowards for ignoble spectacles. The National Guard was recognized; it was the butcher Dubruel, whom Roudier accused on Monday morning of having fired with culpable vivacity. Of the three other dead, two were hat workers; the third remained unknown. And, before the red pools that stained the pavement, gaping groups shivered, looking behind them with an air of mistrust, as if that summary justice which had, in the darkness, restored order with gunshots, was lying in wait for them, watched their gestures and their words, ready to shoot them in their turn, if they did not enthusiastically kiss the hand which had just saved them from demagoguery.","The fusillade which the Rougons had planned in order that they might be finally recognised as the saviours of Plassans, brought the whole terrified and grateful town to their feet. The day broke mournfully with the grey melancholy of a winter-morning. The inhabitants, hearing nothing further, ventured forth, weary of trembling beneath their sheets. At first some ten or fifteen appeared. Later on, when a rumour spread that the insurgents had taken flight, leaving their dead in every gutter, Plassans rose in a body and descended upon the town-hall. Throughout the morning people strolled inquisitively round the four corpses. They were horribly mutilated, particularly one, which had three bullets in the head. But the most horrible to look upon was the body of a national guard, who had fallen under the porch; he had received a charge of the small shot, used by the Republicans in lieu of bullets, full in the face; and blood oozed from his torn and riddled countenance. The crowd feasted their eyes upon this horror, with the avidity for revolting spectacles which is so characteristic of cowards. The national guard was freely recognised; he was the pork-butcher Dubruel, the man whom Roudier had accused on the Monday morning of having fired with culpable eagerness. Of the three other corpses, two were journeymen hatters; the third was not identified. For a long while gaping groups remained shuddering in front of the red pools which stained the pavement, often looking behind them with an air of mistrust, as though that summary justice which had restored order during the night by force of arms, were, even now, watching and listening to them, ready to shoot them down in their turn, unless they kissed with enthusiasm the hand that had just rescued them from the demagogy.","The shooting, which the Rougons had planned to achieve final recognition as the saviours of Plassans, threw the terrified town at their feet.

Throughout the morning people strolled inquisitively round the four corpses. They were horribly mutilated, especially one, which had received three bullets in the head; part of the skull had been blown away, exposing the brain. But the most horrible to contemplate was the body of a Guardsman who had fallen under the porch; he had received a charge of the small-shot used by the republicans instead of bullets, full in the face; blood oozed from his torn, riddled countenance. The crowd gazed in fascination at this dreadful sight, with the attraction to revolting spectacles that characterizes cowards. The man was still recognizable, however; it was the pork-butcher Dubruel, the man Roudier had accused on the Monday morning of having been excessively eager to use his gun. Of the three other corpses, two worked as hatters; the third could not be identified. For a long while groups of gaping spectators stood shuddering beside the pools of blood that stained the pavement, looking uneasily over their shoulders from time to time, as if the authors of the summary justice by which order had been restored during the night, by force of arms, were even now watching and listening to them, ready to shoot them down in their turn unless they kissed the hand that had just saved them from the rabble."
"Pierre se débattait ; il donnait à son esprit une tension extraordinaire ; puis, comme vaincu, d’un ton suppliant, il murmura :","Pierre struggled; he gave his mind an extraordinary tension; then, as if defeated, in a supplicating tone, he murmured:","A violent struggle was going on in Pierre’s mind, which he exerted to the utmost in seeking for some solution; at last, as though he felt vanquished, he murmured, in supplicating tones: “I beseech you, do try to think of something; you haven’t said anything yet.”","A struggle was going on in Pierre’s mind as he strained to think of a solution; at last, as if admitting defeat, he murmured in a tone of supplication:"
"Il était dix heures. Plassans, éveillé, courait les rues, ahuri de la rumeur qui montait. Ceux qui avaient vu ou entendu la bande insurrectionnelle racontaient des histoires à dormir debout, se contredisaient, avançaient des suppositions atroces. Mais le plus grand nombre ne savait même pas ce dont il s’agissait ; ceux-là demeuraient aux extrémités de la ville, et ils écoutaient, bouche béante, comme un conte de nourrice, cette histoire de plusieurs milliers de bandits envahissant les rues et disparaissant avant le jour, ainsi qu’une armée de fantômes. Les plus sceptiques disaient : « Allons donc ! » Cependant certains détails étaient précis. Plassans finit par être convaincu qu’un épouvantable malheur avait passé sur lui pendant son sommeil, sans le toucher. Cette catastrophe mal définie empruntait aux ombres de la nuit, aux contradictions des divers renseignements, un caractère vague, une horreur insondable qui faisaient frissonner les plus braves. Qui donc avait détourné la foudre ? Cela tenait du prodige. On parlait de sauveurs inconnus, d’une petite bande d’hommes qui avaient coupé la tête de l’hydre, mais sans détails, comme d’une chose à peine croyable, lorsque les habitués du salon jaune se répandirent dans les rues, semant les nouvelles, refaisant devant chaque porte le même récit.","It was ten o'clock. Plassans, awake, ran through the streets, bewildered by the rising noise. Those who had seen or heard the insurrectionary band told stories to sleep tall, contradicted themselves, advanced atrocious suppositions. But most of them didn't even know what it was; these lived at the ends of the city, and they listened with gaping mouths, like a nurse's tale, to this story of several thousand bandits invading the streets and disappearing before daybreak, like an army of phantoms. The most skeptical said: “Come on then! However, certain details were precise. Plassans ends up being convinced that a terrible misfortune had passed over him during his sleep, without touching him. This ill-defined catastrophe borrowed from the shadows of the night, from the contradictions of the various pieces of information, a vague character, an unfathomable horror which made the bravest shiver. Who had diverted the lightning? It was a miracle. There was talk of unknown saviors, of a small band of men who had cut off the hydra's head, but without details, as if it were hardly believable, when the regulars of the yellow drawing room poured into the streets, sowing the news, repeating the same story in front of each door.","It was ten o’clock, and Plassans, now wide awake, was running about the streets, wildly excited by the reports which were circulating. Those who had seen or heard the insurrectionary forces, related the most foolish stories, contradicting each other, and indulging in the wildest suppositions. The majority, however, knew nothing at all about the matter; they lived at the further end of the town, and listened with gaping mouths, like children to a nursery tale, to the stories of how several thousand bandits had invaded the streets during the night and vanished before daybreak like an army of phantoms. A few of the most sceptical said: “Nonsense!” Yet some of the details were very precise; and Plassans at last felt convinced that some frightful danger had passed over it while it slept. The darkness which had shrouded this danger, the various contradictory reports that spread, all invested the matter with mystery and vague horror, which made the bravest shudder. Whose hand had diverted the thunderbolt from them? There seemed to be something quite miraculous about it. There were rumours of unknown deliverers, of a handful of brave men who had cut off the hydra’s head; but no one seemed acquainted with the exact particulars, and the whole story appeared scarcely credible, until the company from the yellow drawing-room spread through the streets, scattering tidings, ever repeating the same narrative at each door they came to.","It was ten o’clock, and Plassans was now wide awake.

The most sceptical among them declared it all to be nonsense. But some of the details were very precise, and Plassans at last felt convinced that some terrible danger had passed over it while it slept, leaving it unscathed.

And yet the thought of that wretched Silvère must come to mar his hour of triumph!","Félicité set to work. Pierre still felt rather uneasy despite his rapture. The coup d’état was going to pay off his debts, his son Aristide had recognized the error of his ways, and he was at last going to be rid of Macquart; but he still feared some folly on Pascal’s part, and he was especially worried about what would happen to Silvère. Not that he felt the least sorry for the boy: he was simply afraid that the matter of the gendarme might come before the assizes court. If only some well-aimed bullet had managed to rid him of that young good-for-nothing!

Yet the thought of that wretch Silvère was beginning to spoil his hour of triumph."
"Pascal, dès lors, fut jugé. Il parut heureux de cette peur sourde qu’il inspirait. Moins il avait de malades, plus il pouvait s’occuper de ses chères sciences. Comme il avait mis ses visites à un prix très modique, le peuple lui demeurait fidèle. Il gagnait juste de quoi vivre, et vivait satisfait, à mille lieues des gens du pays, dans la joie pure de ses recherches et de ses découvertes. De temps à autre, il envoyait un mémoire à l’Académie des sciences de Paris. Plassans ignorait absolument que cet original, ce monsieur qui sentait le mort, fût un homme très connu et très écouté du monde savant. Quand on le voyait, le dimanche, partir pour une excursion dans les collines des Garrigues, une boîte de botaniste pendue au cou et un marteau de géologue à la main, on haussait les épaules, on le comparait à tel autre docteur de la ville, si bien cravaté, si mielleux avec les dames, et dont les vêtements exhalaient toujours une délicieuse odeur de violette. Pascal n’était pas davantage compris par ses parents. Lorsque Félicité lui vit arranger sa vie d’une façon si étrange et si mesquine, elle fut stupéfaite et lui reprocha de tromper ses espérances. Elle qui tolérait les paresses d’Aristide, qu’elle croyait fécondes, ne put voir sans colère le train médiocre de Pascal, son amour de l’ombre, son dédain de la richesse, sa ferme résolution de rester à l’écart. Certes, ce ne serait pas cet enfant qui contenterait jamais ses vanités !","Pascal, from then on, was put on trial. He seemed happy with this dull fear he inspired. The fewer patients he had, the more he could occupy himself with his dear sciences. As he had put his visits at a very modest price, the people remained faithful to him. He earned just enough to live on, and lived satisfied, a thousand leagues from the people of the country, in the pure joy of his research and his discoveries. From time to time, he sent a memoir to the Academy of Sciences in Paris. Plassans was absolutely unaware that this original, this gentleman who smelled like death, was a man very well known and very listened to in the learned world. When we saw him, on Sundays, leaving for an excursion in the hills of the Garrigues, a botanist's box hanging from his neck and a geologist's hammer in his hand, we shrugged our shoulders, we compared him to some other doctor in the city, so well tie, so sweet with the ladies, and whose clothes always exhaled a delicious odor of violets. Pascal was no more understood by his parents. When Felicite saw him arrange his life in such a strange and petty way, she was amazed and reproached him for deceiving her hopes. She who tolerated Aristide's laziness, which she believed to be fruitful, could not see without anger Pascal's mediocre train, his love of shadow, his disdain for wealth, his firm resolution to stay away. Certainly, it would not be this child who would ever satisfy his vanities!","From that time, Pascal was condemned. He seemed to rejoice at the mute terror which he inspired. The fewer patients he had, the more time he could devote to his favourite sciences. As his fees were very moderate, the poorer people remained faithful to him; he earned just enough to live, and lived contentedly, a thousand leagues away from the rest of the country, absorbed in the pure delight of his researches and discoveries. From time to time he sent a memoir to the Academie des Sciences at Paris. Plassans did not know that this eccentric character, this gentleman who smelt of death was well-known and highly-esteemed in the world of science. When people saw him starting on Sundays for an excursion among the Garrigues hills, with a botanist’s bag hung round his neck and a geologist’s hammer in his hand, they would shrug their shoulders and institute a comparison between him and some other doctor of the town who was noted for his smart cravat, his affability to the ladies, and the delicious odour of violets which his garments always diffused. Pascal ’s parents did not understand him any better than other people. When Félicité saw him adopting such a strange, unpretentious mode of life she was stupefied, and reproached him for disappointing her hopes. She, who tolerated Aristide’s idleness because she thought it would prove fertile, could not view without regret the slow progress of Pascal, his partiality for obscurity and contempt for riches, his determined resolve to lead a life of retirement. He was certainly not the child who would ever gratify her vanities.","From that day on, Pascal was condemned. He seemed to rejoice in the silent terror he inspired. The fewer patients he had, the more time he could devote to his beloved scientific studies. As his visiting fees were very modest, the poorer people stuck with him. He earned just enough to live on, and lived happily enough in his own world, lost in the pure delight of his researches and discoveries. From time to time he sent a memoir to the Académie des Sciences in Paris. Plassans had no idea that this eccentric character, this gentleman who smelt of death, was well known and greatly respected in the world of science.

Pascal ’s parents did not understand him any better than other people. When Félicité saw him adopting such a strange, narrow way of life she was stupefied, and told him of her disappointment in him. She, who tolerated Aristide’s idleness because she thought it would bear fruit, could not help feeling angry at Pascal’s mediocre position, his preference for obscurity, his contempt for money, and his determination to lead a solitary life. He was certainly not the child who would satisfy her pretensions."

"Le lendemain, dès qu’il entendit l’enfant poser sa cruche, il ouvrit doucement la porte, dont il déblaya d’une poussée le seuil couvert de longues herbes. En allongeant la tête, il aperçut Miette penchée sur la margelle, regardant dans le puits, tout absorbée par l’attente. Alors, il gagna en deux enjambées l’enfoncement formé par le mur, et, de là, il appela : « Miette ! Miette ! » d’une voix adoucie qui la fit tressaillir. Elle leva la tête, le croyant sur le chaperon du mur. Puis, quand elle le vit dans le Jas, à quelques pas d’elle, elle eut un léger cri d’étonnement, elle accourut. Ils se prirent les mains ; ils se contemplaient, ravis d’être si près l’un de l’autre, se trouvant bien plus beaux ainsi, dans la lumière chaude du soleil. C’était la mi-août, le jour de l’Assomption ; au loin les cloches sonnaient, dans cet air limpide des grandes fêtes, qui semble avoir des souffles particuliers de gaietés blondes.","The next day, as soon as he heard the child put down his pitcher, he gently opened the door, pushing clear the threshold covered with long grass.

She raised her head, believing him on the coping on the wall. Then, when she saw him in the Jas, a few paces from her, she gave a slight cry of astonishment, she ran up. They took each other's hands; they gazed at each other, delighted to be so close to each other, finding themselves much more beautiful that way, in the warm sunlight. It was mid-August, Assumption Day; in the distance the bells were ringing, in that limpid air of great celebrations, which seems to have particular breaths of blond gaiety.","On the morrow, as soon as he heard the girl set her pitcher down, he gently opened the door, sweeping away with a push the tall weeds which covered the threshold.

"Sans doute, elle voulait dire que Miette avait le temps de souffrir et de pleurer. Puis, reportant ses yeux sur Silvère, qui avait suivi avec extase la course de l’enfant dans le soleil limpide, elle ajouta simplement :","No doubt she meant that Miette had time to suffer and cry. Then, returning her eyes to Silvere, who had followed with ecstasy the course of the child in the limpid sun, she added simply:","She meant, no doubt, that Miette had plenty of time before her to suffer and weep. Then, turning her eyes upon Silvère, who with a glance of ecstasy had followed the child as she ran off in the bright sunshine, she simply added: “Take care, my boy; this sort of thing sometimes kills one.”","She meant, no doubt, that Miette had plenty of time before her to suffer and weep.

"Et il allait redescendre, quand il entendit sa mère qui reconduisait quelqu’un. Il n’eut que le temps de se jeter dans un trou noir que formait un petit escalier menant aux combles de la maison. La porte s’ouvrit, le marquis parut, suivi de Félicité. M. de Carnavant se retirait d’habitude avant les rentiers de la ville neuve, sans doute pour ne pas avoir à leur distribuer des poignées de main dans la rue.","And he was about to go back downstairs when he heard his mother driving someone home. He only had time to throw himself into a black hole formed by a small staircase leading to the attic of the house. The door opened, the marquis appeared, followed by Felicite. M. de Carnavant usually retired before the tenants of the new town, no doubt so as not to have to shake hands with them in the street.","And he was going to descend again, when he heard the approach of his mother, who was about to show somebody out. He had barely time to hide in a dark corner formed by a little staircase leading to the garrets of the house. The Rougons’ door opened, and the marquis appeared, followed by Félicité. Monsieur de Carnavant usually left before the gentlemen of the new town did, in order no doubt to avoid having to shake hands with them in the street.","He was about to go downstairs again when he heard his mother, who was coming to show someone out.

"Les amants des villes du Midi ont adopté ce genre de promenade. Les garçons et les filles du peuple, ceux qui doivent se marier un jour, et qui ne sont pas fâchés de s’embrasser un peu auparavant, ignorent où se réfugier pour échanger des baisers à l’aise, sans trop s’exposer aux bavardages. Dans la ville, bien que les parents leur laissent une entière liberté, s’ils louaient une chambre, s’ils se rencontraient seul à seule, ils seraient, le lendemain, le scandale du pays ; d’autre part, ils n’ont pas le temps, tous les soirs, de gagner les solitudes de la campagne. Alors ils ont pris un moyen terme : ils battent les faubourgs, les terrains vagues, les allées des routes, tous les endroits où il y a peu de passants et beaucoup de trous noirs. Et, pour plus de prudence, comme tous les habitants se connaissent, ils ont le soin de se rendre méconnaissables, en s’enfouissant dans une de ces grandes mantes, qui abriteraient une famille entière. Les parents tolèrent ces courses en pleines ténèbres ; la morale rigide de la province ne paraît pas s’en alarmer ; il est admis que les amoureux ne s’arrêtent jamais dans les coins ni ne s’assoient au fond des terrains, et cela suffit pour calmer les pudeurs effarouchées. On ne peut guère que s’embrasser en marchant. Parfois cependant une fille tourne mal : les amants se sont assis.","The lovers of the cities of the South have adopted this kind of walk. The boys and girls of the people, those who are to get married one day, and who are not sorry to kiss a little before, do not know where to take refuge to exchange kisses at ease, without exposing themselves too much to gossip. . In the city, although the parents leave them complete freedom, if they rented a room, if they met alone, they would be the scandal of the country the next day; on the other hand, they do not have time, every evening, to reach the solitudes of the countryside. So they took a middle course: they beat the suburbs, the vacant lots, the alleys of the roads, all the places where there are few passers-by and many black holes. And, for greater caution, as all the inhabitants know each other, they take care to make themselves unrecognizable, by burying themselves in one of these large mantis, which would shelter an entire family. The parents tolerate these races in complete darkness; the rigid morality of the province does not seem to be alarmed; it is admitted that lovers never stop in corners or sit at the bottom of grounds, and that is enough to calm frightened modesty. We can only kiss while walking. Sometimes, however, a girl turns out badly: the lovers have sat down.","This style of promenading has been instituted by the young lovers of Southern towns. Those boys and girls among the people who mean to marry sooner or later, but who do not dislike a kiss or two in advance, know no spot where they can kiss at their ease without exposing themselves to recognition and gossip. Accordingly, while strolling about the suburbs, the plots of waste land, the footpaths of the high road—in fact, all these places where there are few passers-by and numerous shady nooks—they conceal their identity by wrapping themselves in these long cloaks, which are capacious enough to cover a whole family. The parents tolerate these proceedings; however stiff may be provincial propriety, no apprehensions, seemingly, are entertained. And, on the other hand, nothing could be more charming than these lovers’ rambles, which appeal so keenly to the Southerner’s fanciful imagination.","This style of walking together has been adopted by the young sweethearts in the towns of the Midi. The sons and daughters of the common people, who mean eventually to marry but are not averse to a kiss or two in advance, do not know where they can kiss undisturbed and without exposing themselves to gossip. Although their parents leave them entirely to their own devices, if they rented a room somewhere in the town in order to be alone, this would immediately create a scandal; on the other hand, they do not have the time to go out into a deserted part of the country every evening. So they have found a compromise: they walk around the outskirts of the town, the patches of waste ground, the sidetracks of the high-road, all those places where there are few passers-by and many shady nooks. And to be more prudent still, since all the townsfolk know each other, they take care not to reveal their identity, by wrapping themselves in these huge cloaks, which are big enough to hide a whole family. The parents tolerate these walks in the dark; despite the strict morality of people in the provinces, they are unconcerned; they know that the young couples never linger in dark corners or sit down in the waste ground, and this is enough to satisfy their sense of propriety. It is hardly possible, while walking, to do anything but kiss. Occasionally, however, some girls turn bad: a young couple sits down."
"Il y eut un cri de surprise. On s’attendait à une petite place. Quelques-uns grimacèrent un sourire ; mais, la vue de la table aidant, les compliments recommencèrent de plus belle.","There was a cry of surprise. We expected a small place. A few grimaced a smile; but, the sight of the table helping, the compliments began again with a vengeance.","There was a cry of surprise. They had expected a small post.

"– J’ai un doute affreux, répondit Pascal. Je voulais vous parler de Silvère, quand vous êtes entré. Il est prisonnier. Il faut agir auprès du préfet, le sauver, s’il en est temps encore. »","“I have a terrible doubt,” replied Pascal. I wanted to talk to you about Silvere when you came in. He is a prisoner. We must act with the prefect, save him, if there is still time. »","“I have a terrible suspicion,” Pascal replied. “I was going to speak to you about Silvère when you came in. He is a prisoner. You must endeavour to obtain his release from the prefect, if there is still time.”","‘I have a terrible suspicion,’ replied Pascal. ‘I was going to talk to you about Silvère when you came in.

"Au loin s’étendaient les routes toutes blanches de lune. La bande insurrectionnelle, dans la campagne froide et claire, reprit sa marche héroïque. C’était comme un large courant d’enthousiasme. Le souffle d’épopée qui emportait Miette et Silvère, ces grands enfants avides d’amour et de liberté, traversait avec une générosité sainte les honteuses comédies des Macquart et des Rougon. La voix haute du peuple, par intervalles, grondait, entre les bavardages du salon jaune et les diatribes de l’oncle Antoine. Et la farce vulgaire, la farce ignoble, tournait au grand drame de l’histoire.","In the distance stretched the roads all white with the moon. The insurrectionary band, in the cold and clear countryside, resumed its heroic march. It was like a broad current of enthusiasm. The epic breath which carried away Miette and Silvere, those grown-up children avid of love and liberty, traversed with holy generosity the shameful comedies of the Macquarts and the Rougons. The high voice of the people rumbled at intervals, between the chatter of the yellow drawing-room and the diatribes of Uncle Antoine. And the vulgar farce, the ignoble farce, turned into the great drama of history.","The high roads stretched far way, white with moonlight. The insurrectionary army was continuing its heroic march through the cold, clear country. It was like a mighty wave of enthusiasm. The thrill of patriotism, which transported Miette and Silvère, big children that they were, eager for love and liberty, sped, with generous fervour, athwart the sordid intrigues of the Macquarts and the Rougons. At intervals the trumpet-voice of the people rose and drowned the prattle of the yellow drawing-room and the hateful discourses of uncle Antoine.

"Cependant Rougon avait ramené Granoux dans le salon.

Quand le marquis et Vuillet se furent également levés :","Rougon, however, had brought Granoux back into the drawing-room.

"Déjà il songeait aux grandes mesures révolutionnaires : la nomination d’une Commune dont il serait le chef, l’emprisonnement des mauvais patriotes et surtout des gens qui lui déplaisaient. La pensée des Rougon vaincus, du salon jaune désert, de toute cette clique lui demandant grâce, le plongeait dans une douce joie. Pour prendre patience, il avait résolu d’adresser une proclamation aux habitants de Plassans. Ils s’étaient mis quatre pour rédiger cette affiche. Quand elle fut terminée, Macquart, prenant une pose digne dans le fauteuil du maire, se la fit lire, avant de l’envoyer à l’imprimerie de l’Indépendant, sur le civisme de laquelle il comptait. Un des rédacteurs commençait avec emphase : « Habitants de Plassans, l’heure de l’indépendance a sonné, le règne de la justice est venu… » lorsqu’un bruit se fit entendre à la porte du cabinet, qui s’ouvrait lentement.","Already he was thinking of the great revolutionary measures: the appointment of a Commune of which he would be the leader, the imprisonment of bad patriots and especially of people who displeased him.

To gain patience, he had resolved to address a proclamation to the inhabitants of Plassans. They had four to write this poster. When it was finished, Macquart, taking a dignified pose in the mayor's chair, had it read to him, before sending it to the printing press of the Independent, on whose civility he counted. One of the editors began emphatically: ""Inhabitants of Plassans, the hour of independence has struck, the reign of justice has come..."" when a noise was heard at the cabinet door, which opened slowly.","He was already meditating important revolutionary measures; the nomination of a Commune of which he would be the chief, the imprisonment of all bad patriots, and particularly of all such persons as had incurred his displeasure.

In order to while away the time he resolved to issue a proclamation to the inhabitants of Plassans. Four of his party set to work to draw up this proclamation, and when it was finished Macquart, assuming a dignified manner in the mayor’s arm-chair, had it read to him before sending it to the printing office of the “Indépendant,” on whose patriotism he reckoned.

"Pendant près d’une vingtaine d’années, chacun y vécut à son caprice, les enfants comme la mère. Tout y poussa librement. En devenant femme, Adélaïde était restée la grande fille étrange qui passait à quinze ans pour une sauvage ; non pas qu’elle fût folle, ainsi que le prétendaient les gens du faubourg, mais il y avait en elle un manque d’équilibre entre le sang et les nerfs, une sorte de détraquement du cerveau et du cœur, qui la faisait vivre en dehors de la vie ordinaire, autrement que tout le monde. Elle était certainement très naturelle, très logique avec elle-même ; seulement sa logique devenait de la pure démence aux yeux des voisins. Elle semblait vouloir s’afficher, chercher méchamment à ce que tout, chez elle, allât de mal en pis, lorsqu’elle obéissait avec une grande naïveté aux seules poussées de son tempérament.","For nearly twenty years, everyone lived there at their whim, the children as well as the mother. Everything there grew freely. On becoming a woman, Adelaide had remained the strange tall girl who at fifteen passed for a savage; not that she was mad, as the people of the faubourg claimed, but there was in her a lack of balance between the blood and the nerves, a kind of disorder of the brain and the heart, which made her outside of ordinary life, unlike everyone else. She was certainly very natural, very logical with herself; only his logic was becoming sheer madness in the eyes of the neighbors. She seemed to want to show off, to mean that everything in her house would go from bad to worse, when she obeyed with great naivety the only impulses of her temperament.","For nearly twenty years everyone lived there after his or her fancy, the children like the mother. Everything went on free from control. In growing to womanhood, Adélaïde had retained the strangeness which had been taken for shyness when she was fifteen. It was not that she was insane, as the people of the Faubourg asserted, but there was a lack of equilibrium between her nerves and her blood, a disorder of the brain and heart which made her lead a life out of the ordinary, different from that of the rest of the world. She was certainly very natural, very consistent with herself; but in the eyes of the neighbours her consistency became pure insanity. She seemed desirous of making herself conspicuous, it was thought she was wickedly determined to turn things at home from bad to worse, whereas with great naivete she simply acted according to the impulses of her nature.","For nearly twenty years they all lived there following their fancies, the children like the mother.

"À ce désir de mort, ils eurent une étreinte plus étroite. Miette comptait bien mourir avec Silvère ; celui-ci n’avait parlé que de lui, mais elle sentait qu’il l’emporterait avec joie dans la terre. Ils s’y aimeraient plus librement qu’au grand soleil. Tante Dide mourrait, elle aussi, et viendrait les rejoindre. Ce fut comme un pressentiment rapide, un souhait d’une étrange volupté que le ciel, par les voix désolées du tocsin, leur promettait de bientôt satisfaire. Mourir ! mourir ! les cloches répétaient ce mot avec un emportement croissant, et les amoureux se laissaient aller à ces appels de l’ombre ; ils croyaient prendre un avant-goût du dernier sommeil, dans cette somnolence où les replongeaient la tiédeur de leurs membres et les brûlures de leurs lèvres, qui venaient encore de se rencontrer.","At this death wish, they had a tighter embrace. Miette counted on dying with Silvere; he had spoken only of himself, but she felt that he would carry her off with joy into the earth.

It was like a sudden presentiment, a wish of a strange voluptuousness which heaven, by the desolate voices of the tocsin, promised them soon to satisfy. To die ! to die ! the bells repeated this word with increasing anger, and the lovers gave way to these calls from the shadows; they thought they were taking a foretaste of their last sleep, in that drowsiness into which the warmth of their limbs and the burning of their lips had plunged them, which had just met again.","At this longing for death they tightened their embrace. Miette relied upon dying with Silvère; he had only spoken of himself, but she felt that he would gladly take her with him into the earth.

"Le fils légitime, le petit Pierre Rougon, grandit avec les bâtards de sa mère. Adélaïde garda auprès d’elle ces derniers, Antoine et Ursule, les louveteaux, comme on les nommait dans le quartier, sans d’ailleurs les traiter ni plus ni moins tendrement que son enfant du premier lit. Elle paraissait n’avoir pas une conscience bien nette de la situation faite dans la vie à ces deux pauvres créatures.

"Il alla droit chez Roudier, qu’il trouva debout, prêt à marcher, mais dans une ignorance complète des événements de la nuit. Roudier demeurait à l’extrémité de la ville neuve, au fond d’un désert où le passage des insurgés n’avait envoyé aucun écho. Pierre lui proposa d’aller chercher Granoux, dont la maison faisait un angle de la place des Récollets, et sous les fenêtres duquel la bande avait dû passer. La bonne du conseiller municipal parlementa longtemps avant de les introduire, et ils entendaient la voix tremblante du pauvre homme, qui criait du premier étage :","He went straight to Roudier, whom he found standing, ready to walk, but in complete ignorance of the events of the night.

"Un régiment venait, en effet, d’arriver, sous les ordres du colonel Masson et de M. de Blériot, préfet du département. Les fusils aperçus des remparts, au loin dans la plaine, avaient d’abord fait croire à l’approche des insurgés. L’émotion de Rougon fut si forte, que deux grosses larmes coulèrent sur ses joues.

"Les plus fins politiques de Plassans, ceux qui dirigeaient le mouvement réactionnaire, ne flairèrent l’Empire que fort tard. La popularité du prince Louis-Napoléon leur parut un engouement passager de la foule dont on aurait facilement raison. La personne même du prince leur inspirait une admiration médiocre. Ils le jugeaient nul, songe-creux, incapable de mettre la main sur la France et surtout de se maintenir au pouvoir. Pour eux, ce n’était qu’un instrument dont ils comptaient se servir, qui ferait la place nette, et qu’ils mettraient à la porte, lorsque l’heure serait venue où le vrai prétendant devrait se montrer. Cependant les mois s’écoulèrent, ils devinrent inquiets. Alors seulement ils eurent vaguement conscience qu’on les dupait. Mais on ne leur laissa pas le temps de prendre un parti ; le coup d’État éclata sur leurs têtes, et ils durent applaudir. La grande impure, la République, venait d’être assassinée. C’était un triomphe quand même. Le clergé et la noblesse acceptèrent les faits avec résignation, remettant à plus tard la réalisation de leurs espérances, se vengeant de leur mécompte en s’unissant aux bonapartistes pour écraser les derniers républicains.","The finest politicians of Plassans, those who led the reactionary movement, did not smell the Empire until very late. The popularity of Prince Louis-Napoleon seemed to them a passing infatuation of the crowd which could easily be overcome. The very person of the prince inspired them with a mediocre admiration. They considered him useless, a dreamer, incapable of getting their hands on France and above all of staying in power. For them, it was only an instrument which they intended to use, which would clean up the place, and which they would throw out, when the time came when the true suitor should show up.

"Dès ses premières couches, elle fut sujette à des crises nerveuses qui la jetaient dans des convulsions terribles. Ces crises revenaient périodiquement tous les deux ou trois mois. Les médecins qui furent consultés répondirent qu’il n’y avait rien à faire, que l’âge calmerait ces accès. On la mit seulement au régime des viandes saignantes et du vin de quinquina. Ces secousses répétées achevèrent de la détraquer. Elle vécut au jour le jour, comme une enfant, comme une bête caressante qui cède à ses instincts.

"Lisa, née la première, en 1827, un an après le mariage, resta peu au logis. C’était une grosse et belle enfant, très saine, toute sanguine, qui ressemblait beaucoup à sa mère. Mais elle ne devait pas avoir son dévouement de bête de somme. Macquart avait mis en elle un besoin de bien-être très arrêté. Tout enfant, elle consentait à travailler une journée entière pour avoir un gâteau. Elle n’avait pas sept ans, qu’elle fut prise en amitié par la directrice des postes, une voisine. Celle-ci en fit une petite bonne. Lorsqu’elle perdit son mari, en 1839, et qu’elle alla se retirer à Paris, elle emmena Lisa avec elle. Les parents la lui avaient comme donnée.","Lisa, born first, in 1827, a year after the marriage, remained little at home. She was a big, beautiful child, very healthy, full of blood, who looked a lot like her mother. But she must not have his workhorse devotion. Macquart had imbued her with a very fixed need for well-being. As a child, she agreed to work a whole day to have a cake. She was not seven years old when she was befriended by the postmaster, a neighbor. This one made a little maid. When she lost her husband in 1839 and went to retire to Paris, she took Lisa with her. The parents had given it to him.","Lisa,[*] born the first, in 1827, one year after the marriage, remained but little at home. She was a fine, big, healthy, full-blooded child, greatly resembling her mother. She did not, however, inherit the latter’s animal devotion and endurance. Macquart had implanted in her a most decided longing for ease and comfort. While she was a child she would consent to work for a whole day in return for a cake. When she was scarcely seven years old, the wife of the postmaster, who was a neighbour of the Macquarts, took a liking to her. She made a little maid of her. And when she lost her husband in 1839, and went to live in Paris, she took Lisa with her. The parents had almost given her their daughter.","Lisa, the first to be born, in 1827, a year after the marriage, spent little time in the house.

"« Mais d’où sors-tu ? lui disait-elle parfois. Tu n’es pas à nous. Vois tes frères, ils cherchent, ils tâchent de tirer profit de l’instruction que nous leur avons donnée.

"Leur pétulance d’écolier s’accommodant mal de ces faiblesses subites, ils finirent par accuser leur retraite de manquer d’air et par se décider à aller promener leur tendresse plus loin, en pleine campagne. Alors ce furent, chaque soir, de nouvelles escapades. Miette vint avec sa pelisse ; tous deux s’enfouissaient dans le large vêtement, ils filaient le long des murs, ils gagnaient la grand-route, les champs libres, les champs larges où l’air roulait puissamment comme les vagues de la haute mer.

And here they no longer felt stifled; they recovered all their youthfulness, free from the giddy intoxication born of the tall rank weeds of the Aire Saint-Mittre.","Like bad-tempered schoolchildren, they became irritated by this sudden faintness and began to find their hideaway too confined, and decided to wander through the open fields.

"C’était là qu’ils avaient osé se baiser sur les joues. Ce souvenir que l’enfant venait d’évoquer, leur causa à tous deux une sensation délicieuse, émotion dans laquelle se mêlaient les joies de la veille et les espoirs du lendemain. Ils virent, comme à la lueur d’un éclair, les bonnes soirées qu’ils avaient vécues ensemble, surtout cette soirée de la Fête-Dieu, dont ils se rappelaient les moindres détails, le grand ciel tiède, le frais des saules de la Viorne, les mots caressants de leur causerie. Et, en même temps, tandis que les choses du passé leur remontaient au cœur avec une saveur douce, ils crurent pénétrer l’inconnu de l’avenir, se voir au bras l’un de l’autre, ayant réalisé leur rêve et se promenant dans la vie comme ils venaient de le faire sur la grande route, chaudement couverts d’une même pelisse. Alors le ravissement les reprit, les yeux sur les yeux, se souriant, perdus au milieu des muettes clartés.","It was there that they had dared to kiss each other on the cheeks. This memory that the child had just evoked caused them both a delicious sensation, an emotion in which the joys of the day before and the hopes of the morrow were mingled. They saw, as if by lightning, the good evenings they had spent together, especially that evening of Corpus Christi, of which they remembered the smallest details, the great warm sky, the coolness of the willows of the Viorne, the caressing words of their chat. And, at the same time, while the things of the past came back to their hearts with a sweet savour, they thought they were penetrating the unknown of the future, seeing themselves in each other's arms, having realized their dream and strolling through life as they had just done on the main road, warmly covered in the same fur coat. Then rapture took them over, eyes on each other, smiling at each other, lost in the midst of the mute lights.","This was the spot where they had first ventured to kiss each other on the cheek.

Then rapture came to them again, and they smiled in each other’s eyes, alone amidst all the silent radiance.","This was the spot where they had first ventured to kiss each other on the cheeks.

"Pierre rentra l’oreille basse, se coulant dans l’ombre des maisons. Il sentait autour de lui Plassans lui devenir hostile. Il entendait, dans les groupes, courir son nom, avec des paroles de colère et de mépris. Ce fut en chancelant et la sueur aux tempes, qu’il monta l’escalier. Félicité le reçut, silencieuse, la mine consternée. Elle aussi commençait à désespérer. Tout leur rêve croulait. Ils se tinrent là, dans le salon jaune, face à face. Le jour tombait, un jour sale d’hiver qui donnait des teintes boueuses au papier orange à grands ramages ; jamais la pièce n’avait paru plus fanée, plus sordide, plus honteuse. Et, à cette heure, ils étaient seuls ; ils n’avaient plus, comme la veille, un peuple de courtisans qui les félicitaient. Une journée venait de suffire pour les vaincre, au moment où ils chantaient victoire. Si le lendemain la situation ne changeait pas, la partie était perdue. Félicité qui, la veille, songeait aux plaines d’Austerlitz, en regardant les ruines du salon jaune, pensait maintenant, à le voir si morne et si désert, aux champs maudits de Waterloo.","Pierre returned with low ears, slipping into the shadows of the houses. He felt around him Plassans becoming hostile to him. He heard his name run around in the groups, with words of anger and contempt. It was staggering and sweating at his temples that he climbed the stairs. Félicité received him, silent, looking dismayed. She too was beginning to despair. Their whole dream crumbled. They stood there, in the yellow living room, face to face. Day was falling, a dirty winter day which gave muddy tints to the orange paper with its large foliage; never had the room seemed more faded, more sordid, more shameful. And, at this hour, they were alone; they no longer had, as on the previous day, a people of courtiers who congratulated them. One day had just sufficed to defeat them, at the moment when they were singing victory. If the situation did not change the next day, the game was lost. Félicité, who the day before had been thinking of the plains of Austerlitz, looking at the ruins of the yellow salon, was now thinking of seeing it so gloomy and so deserted, of the accursed fields of Waterloo.","Rougon went home looking very downcast, and creeping along under the shadows of the houses. He felt that Plassans was becoming hostile to him. He heard his name bandied about amongst the groups, with expressions of anger and contempt. He walked upstairs, reeling and perspiring.

The day was drawing to a close, a murky winter day which imparted a muddy tint to the orange-coloured wall-paper with its large flower pattern; never had the room looked more faded, more mean, more shabby. And at this hour they were alone; they no longer had a crowd of courtiers congratulating them, as on the previous evening. A single day had sufficed to topple them over, at the very moment when they were singing victory. If the situation did not change on the morrow their game would be lost.

"Mais le chiffon de satin rose, passé à la boutonnière de Pierre, n’était pas la seule tache rouge dans le triomphe des Rougon. Oublié sous le lit de la pièce voisine, se trouvait encore un soulier au talon sanglant. Le cierge qui brûlait auprès de M. Peirotte, de l’autre côté de la rue, saignait dans l’ombre comme une blessure ouverte. Et, au loin, au fond de l’aire Saint-Mittre, sur la pierre tombale, une mare de sang se caillait.","But the pink satin chiffon, worn in Pierre's buttonhole, was not the only red stain in the Rougons' triumph.

"Les autorités étaient revenues depuis la veille, dans deux carrioles louées à Sainte-Roure. Leur entrée imprévue n’avait rien eu de triomphal. Rougon rendit au maire son fauteuil sans grande tristesse. Le tour était joué ; il attendait de Paris, avec fièvre, la récompense de son civisme. Le dimanche – il ne l’espérait que pour le lendemain – il reçut une lettre d’Eugène. Félicité avait eu soin, dès le jeudi, d’envoyer à son fils les numéros de la Gazette et de l’Indépendant, qui, dans une seconde édition, avaient raconté la bataille de la nuit et l’arrivée du préfet. Eugène répondait, courrier par courrier, que la nomination de son père à une recette particulière allait être signée ; mais, disait-il, il voulait sur-le-champ lui annoncer une bonne nouvelle : il venait d’obtenir pour lui le ruban de la Légion d’honneur. Félicité pleura. Son mari décoré ! son rêve d’orgueil n’était jamais allé jusque-là. Rougon, pâle de joie, dit qu’il fallait le soir même donner un grand dîner. Il ne comptait plus, il aurait jeté au peuple, par les deux fenêtres du salon jaune, ses dernières pièces de cent sous pour célébrer ce beau jour.","The authorities had returned the day before, in two carts hired from Sainte-Roure. Their unexpected entrance had been in no way triumphant. Rougon gave the mayor back his chair without much sadness. The trick was done; he eagerly awaited from Paris the reward for his civic-mindedness. On Sunday - he only hoped for the next day - he received a letter from Eugene. Félicité had taken care, on Thursday, to send her son the numbers of the Gazette and the Independent, which, in a second edition, had related the battle of the night and the arrival of the prefect. Eugene replied, mail by mail, that his father's appointment to a particular recipe was going to be signed; but, he said, he wanted to give him some good news right away: he had just obtained for himself the ribbon of the Legion of Honor. Felicity wept. Her decorated husband! his dream of pride had never gone that far. Rougon, pale with joy, said that a big dinner should be given that very evening. He no longer counted, he would have thrown to the people, through the two windows of the yellow drawing-room, his last five-sou pieces to celebrate this fine day.","The municipal authorities had returned on the previous evening in a couple of carts hired at Sainte-Roure.

Since the previous Thursday Félicité had taken care to send her son the numbers of the “Gazette” and “Indépendant” which, in special second editions had narrated the battle of the night and the arrival of the prefect at Plassans. Eugène now replied by return of post that the nomination of a receivership would soon be signed; but added that he wished to give them some good news immediately. He had obtained the ribbon of the Legion of Honour for his father. Félicité wept with joy. Her husband decorated! Her proud dream had never gone as far as that.

"– Tu sais cela ? toi, dit Félicité devenue sérieuse et méfiante. Eh bien, tu es alors moins bête que je ne croyais. Est-ce que tu décachetterais les lettres, comme quelqu’un de ma connaissance ?","– Do you know that? you, said Felicite, now serious and suspicious. Well, then you are less stupid than I thought. Would you open the letters, like someone I know?","“You know that, do you?” exclaimed Félicité, becoming serious and distrustful. “Well, you’re not so foolish as I thought, then. Do you open letters like some one of my acquaintance?”","‘You know all that, do you?’ said Félicité, becoming serious and distrustful. ‘You’re cleverer than I thought, then.

"Au bout d’une heure, ils se retrouvèrent dans le hangar, situé au fond d’un quartier perdu. Ils étaient allés discrètement, de porte en porte, étouffant le bruit des sonnettes et des marteaux, racolant le plus d’hommes possible. Mais ils n’avaient pu en réunir qu’une quarantaine, qui arrivèrent à la file, se glissant dans l’ombre, sans cravate, avec les mines blêmes et encore tout endormies de bourgeois effarés. Le hangar, loué à un tonnelier, se trouvait encombré de vieux cercles, de barils effondrés, qui s’entassaient dans les coins. Au milieu, les fusils étaient couchés dans trois caisses longues. Un rat de cave, posé sur une pièce de bois, éclairait cette scène étrange d’une lueur de veilleuse qui vacillait. Quand Rougon eut retiré les couvercles des trois caisses, ce fut un spectacle d’un sinistre grotesque. Au-dessus des fusils, dont les canons luisaient, bleuâtres et comme phosphorescents, des cous s’allongeaient, des têtes se penchaient avec une sorte d’horreur secrète, tandis que, sur les murs, la clarté jaune du rat de cave dessinait l’ombre de nez énormes et de mèches de cheveux roidies.","After an hour, they found themselves in the shed, located at the end of a lost district. They had gone discreetly, from door to door, muffling the sound of doorbells and knockers, soliciting as many men as possible. But they had only been able to muster about forty of them, who arrived in a row, slipping into the shadows, without ties, with the pale and still sleepy faces of bewildered bourgeois. The shed, rented from a cooper, was cluttered with old hoops, collapsed barrels, piled up in the corners. In the middle, the guns were lying in three long boxes. A cellar rat, perched on a piece of wood, lit up this eerie scene with a flickering nightlight glow. When Rougon had taken off the lids of the three chests, it was a spectacle of grotesque sinisterness. Above the guns, whose barrels gleamed bluish and as if phosphorescent, necks stretched out, heads leaned forward with a sort of secret horror, while on the walls the yellow light of the cellar rat drew the shadow of huge noses and stiff locks of hair.","An hour or so later the friends met again in the cart-shed, which was situated in a very lonely spot. They had glided stealthily from door to door, knocking and ringing as quietly as possible, and picking up all the men they could. However, they had only succeeded in collecting some forty, who arrived one after the other, creeping along in the dark, with the pale and drowsy countenances of men who had been violently startled from their sleep. The cart-shed, let to a cooper, was littered with old hoops and broken casks, of which there were piles in every corner. The guns were stored in the middle, in three long boxes. A taper, stuck on a piece of wood, illumined the strange scene with a flickering glimmer. When Rougon had removed the covers of the three boxes, the spectacle became weirdly grotesque. Above the fire-arms, whose barrels shown with a bluish, phosphorescent glitter, were outstretched necks and heads that bent with a sort of secret fear, while the yellow light of the taper cast shadows of huge noses and locks of stiffened hair upon the walls.","An hour or so later the friends met up again in the cart-shed, which was situated in an out-of-the-way spot. They had gone discreetly from door to door, knocking and ringing as quietly as possible and picking up as many men as they could. However, they had only managed to collect about forty, who arrived one after the other, creeping along in the dark, half-dressed, with the pale, drowsy faces of solid citizens startled out of their slumber. The cart-shed, let to a cooper, was littered with old hoops and broken barrels, which were piled up in each corner. The guns were stored in the middle, in three long boxes. A flickering candle, stuck on a piece of wood, illuminated this strange scene. When Rougon had removed the lids of the three boxes the spectacle became quite grotesque. Standing round the firearms, whose barrels shone with a bluish, phosphorescent hue , they craned their necks and leaned forward with barely concealed horror, while the yellow light of the candle cast on the walls shadows of huge noses and strands of stiffened hair."
"À ce dernier coup, elle alla se jeter chancelante sur un vieux coffre, où elle resta toute la nuit à sangloter.","At this last blow, she went to throw herself unsteadily on an old chest, where she remained all night, sobbing.","But, in his irritation, he still affected to doubt it, and did not cease to question the poor woman, again and again reproaching her with misconduct.","With this final blow, she staggered backwards and threw herself on an old chest, where she lay sobbing for the rest of the night."
"« Hein ? quoi ? qu’est-ce qu’il y a ? demanda-t-il, en remettant précipitamment sa calotte de soie noire dans la poche.",""" Eh ? what ?

"Seul, le marquis, qui avait tout son sang-froid de gentilhomme, accueillit ces paroles par un sourire. Les autres, dans la fièvre de l’heure présente, se moquaient bien de ce qui arriverait ensuite ! Toutes les opinions sombraient. Roudier, oubliant sa tendresse d’ancien boutiquier pour les Orléans, interrompit Pierre avec brusquerie. Tous crièrent :","Only the Marquis, who had all the coolness of a gentleman, greeted these words with a smile. The others, in the fever of the present hour, didn't care what happened next! All opinions sank. Roudier, forgetting his fondness as a former shopkeeper for the Orleans, abruptly interrupted Pierre. Everyone shouted:","The marquis, who had retained his aristocratic coolness, was the only one who greeted these words with a smile. The others, in the enthusiasm of the moment, concerned themselves very little about what might follow. All their opinions foundered. Roudier, forgetting the esteem which as a former shopkeeper he had entertained for the Orleanists, stopped Pierre rather abruptly. And everybody exclaimed: “Don’t argue the matter.","The Marquis, who had maintained his aristocratic composure, was the only one who greeted these words with a smile.

"« Tu m’avais avertie… cependant j’espérais encore… Enfin, c’est décidé. »","“You warned me… however I still hoped… Finally, it’s decided. »","However, it is decided.”","Anyway, it’s decided.’"
"« Je te dis que tu ne sortiras pas », répétait la vieille, qui se cramponnait à l’un de ses bras.","“I tell you that you will not go out,” repeated the old woman, who clung to one of her arms.","“I tell you you shall not go,” the old woman reiterated, as she clung to one of his arms.","‘I tell you, you won’t go,’ the old woman repeated, clutching hold of his arm."
"Mais Félicité, plus nerveuse, frissonnait. Il lui semblait qu’elle venait de condamner un homme à mort. Maintenant, si M. Peirotte était tué, elle le reverrait la nuit, il viendrait lui tirer les pieds. Elle ne jeta plus sur les fenêtres d’en face que des coups d’œil sournois, pleins d’une horreur voluptueuse. Et il y eut, dès lors, dans ses jouissances, une pointe d’épouvante criminelle qui les rendit plus aiguës.","But Felicite, more nervous, was shivering. It seemed to her that she had just condemned a man to death. Now, if M. Peirotte were killed, she would see him again at night, he would come and pull her feet. All she cast at the windows opposite was sly glances full of voluptuous horror. And there was, from then on, in his enjoyments, a touch of criminal terror which made them more acute.","But Félicité shuddered. She felt that she had just condemned a man to death. If Monsieur Peirotte should now be killed, she would always see his ghost at night time. He would come and haunt her. So she only ventured to cast furtive glances, full of fearful delight, at the unhappy man’s windows. Henceforward all her enjoyment would be fraught with a touch of guilty terror.",But Félicité shuddered. She felt that she had just condemned a man to death. If Monsieur Peirotte should now be killed she would always see his ghost at night. He would come and haunt her. Now she cast only furtive little glances at the windows opposite.

He’s put the final nail in our coffin; people will think I’ve made him write this diatribe.’"
"Le commandant avait, en effet, de concert avec Rougon, caché, dans une sorte d’écurie, près des remparts, une provision de cartouches et un nombre assez considérable de fusils ; il s’était en même temps assuré le concours de gardes nationaux sur lesquels il croyait pouvoir compter. Ses paroles produisirent une très heureuse impression. Ce soir-là, en se séparant, les paisibles bourgeois du salon jaune parlaient de massacrer « les rouges », s’ils osaient bouger.","The commander had, in fact, in concert with Rougon, hidden in a kind of stable near the ramparts, a supply of cartridges and a considerable number of muskets; he had at the same time secured the assistance of National Guards on whom he believed he could count.

That evening, as they separated, the peaceful bourgeois of the yellow drawing room spoke of massacring ""the reds"" if they dared to move.","As a matter of fact the commander, in concert with Rougon, had concealed, in a kind of cart-house near the ramparts, both a supply of cartridges and a considerable number of muskets; he had also taken steps to secure the co-operation of the National Guard, on which he believed he could rely. His words produced a very favourable impression. On separating for the evening, the peaceful citizens of the yellow drawing-room spoke of massacring the “Reds” if they should dare to stir.","And indeed, the Commander, together with Rougon, had hidden a generous supply of cartridges and a considerable number of muskets in an old cart-shed near the ramparts; he had also taken steps to secure the cooperation of the National Guard, on which he believed he could rely.

"Elle ne pouvait pas. Elle agita les mains, d’un mouvement doux et lent, pour dire que ce n’était pas sa faute. Ses lèvres serrées s’amincissaient déjà sous le doigt de la mort. Les cheveux dénoués, la tête roulée dans les plis sanglants du drapeau, elle n’avait plus que ses yeux de vivants, des yeux noirs, qui luisaient dans son visage blanc. Silvère sanglota. Les regards de ces grands yeux navrés lui faisaient mal. Il y voyait un immense regret de la vie. Miette lui disait qu’elle partait seule, avant les noces, qu’elle s’en allait sans être sa femme ; elle lui disait encore que c’était lui qui avait voulu cela, qu’il aurait dû l’aimer comme tous les garçons aiment les filles. À son agonie, dans cette lutte rude que sa nature sanguine livrait à la mort, elle pleurait sa virginité. Silvère, penché sur elle, comprit les sanglots amers de cette chair ardente. Il entendit au loin les sollicitations des vieux ossements ; il se rappela ces caresses qui avaient brûlé leurs lèvres, dans la nuit, au bord de la route : elle se pendait à son cou, elle lui demandait tout l’amour, et lui, il n’avait pas su, il la laissait partir petite fille, désespérée de n’avoir pas goûté aux voluptés de la vie. Alors, désolé de la voir n’emporter de lui qu’un souvenir d’écolier et de bon camarade, il baisa sa poitrine de vierge, cette gorge pure et chaste qu’il venait de découvrir. Il ignorait ce buste frissonnant, cette puberté admirable. Ses larmes trempaient ses lèvres. Il collait sa bouche sanglotante sur la peau de l’enfant. Ces baisers d’amant mirent une dernière joie dans les yeux de Miette. Ils s’aimaient, et leur idylle se dénouait dans la mort.","She could not. She waved her hands, gently and slowly, to say that it wasn't her fault. Her tight lips were already thinning under the finger of death. Her hair loose, her head rolled up in the bloody folds of the flag, she only had her living eyes, black eyes, which gleamed in her white face. Silvere sobbed. The looks in those big heartbroken eyes hurt him. He saw in it an immense regret for life. Miette told him that she was leaving alone, before the wedding, that she was leaving without being his wife; she told him again that it was he who had wanted this, that he should have loved her as all boys love girls. In her agony, in this harsh struggle which her sanguine nature delivered to death, she wept for her virginity. Silvere, leaning over her, understood the bitter sobs of this ardent flesh. He heard in the distance the solicitations of the old bones; he remembered those caresses that had burned their lips, in the night, by the side of the road: she hung around his neck, she asked him for all her love, and he, he hadn't known, he let her go little girl, desperate for not having tasted the pleasures of life. So, sorry to see her take away only a memory of a schoolboy and a good friend, he kissed her virgin chest, that pure and chaste throat he had just discovered. He was unaware of this quivering bust, this admirable puberty. Her tears soaked her lips. He pressed his sobbing mouth to the child's skin. These lover's kisses brought a last joy to Miette's eyes. They loved each other, and their idyll ended in death.","She could not; she slowly, gently shook her hand, as if to say that it was not her fault. Her close-pressed lips were already contracting beneath the touch of death. With her unbound hair streaming around her, and her head resting amid the folds of the blood-red banner, all her life now centred in her eyes, those black eyes glittering in her white face. Silvère sobbed. The glance of those big sorrowful eyes filled him with distress. He read in them bitter, immense regret for life. Miette was telling him that she was going away all alone, and before their bridal day; that she was leaving him ere she had become his wife. She was telling him, too, that it was he who had willed that it should be so, that he should have loved her as other lovers love their sweethearts. In the hour of her agony, amidst that stern conflict between death and her vigorous nature, she bewailed her fate in going like that to the grave. Silvère, as he bent over her, understood how bitter was the pang. He recalled their caresses, how she had hung round his neck, and had yearned for his love, but he had not understood, and now she was departing from him for evermore. Bitterly grieved at the thought that throughout her eternal rest she would remember him solely as a companion and playfellow, he kissed her on the bosom while his hot tears fell upon her lips. Those passionate kisses brought a last gleam of joy to Miette’s eyes. They loved one another, and their idyll ended in death.","She could not. She slowly moved her hands, as if to say that it was not her fault. Her tightly closed lips were already contracting under the touch of death. With her hair streaming over her shoulders and her head resting in the folds of the blood-red banner, all the life that remained in her was expressed by her eyes, her black eyes glittering in her ashen face. Silvère began to sob. The expression in those big, sorrowful eyes pained him. He saw in them an immense regret for life. Miette was telling him that she was going away alone, before their wedding day, and that she was leaving before becoming his wife; she was telling him, too, that it was his wish that it be so, that he should have loved her as other lovers love their sweethearts. In the hour of her agony, in the terrible struggle between death and her sanguine nature, she regretted her virginity. Silvère, as he bent over her, understood the bitter tears of this passionate young girl. He heard the distant cries of the old cemetery bones; he recalled their caresses and their burning kisses in the night, by the side of the road; he remembered how she had thrown her arms round him, yearning for his love, but he had not understood, and now he was letting her go forever, a virgin, grieving at the thought of never having tasted the deep pleasures of life. Desperately sad at the thought that the only memory of him that she would take with her would be that of a friend and playmate, he kissed her on her breasts, the pure virgin breasts he now saw for the first time. His hot tears fell on her lips. He kissed her soft skin. His passionate kisses brought a last gleam of joy to Miette’s eyes. They loved each other, and their idyll was ending in death."
« Sans condition ? demanda-t-il enfin.,""" Without condition ? he finally asked.","“Unconditionally?” he asked, at length.",‘Unconditionally?’ he asked after a pause.
"Félicité ne s’était pas couchée. Il la trouva endimanchée, avec son bonnet à rubans citron, comme une femme qui attend du monde. Elle était vainement restée à la fenêtre, elle n’avait rien entendu ; elle se mourait de curiosité.","Félicité had not gone to bed.

"Cependant la bande réactionnaire se compta, et, devant son petit nombre, elle eut une hésitation. On n’était que trente-neuf, on allait pour sûr se faire massacrer ; un père de famille parla de ses enfants ; d’autres, sans alléguer de prétexte, se dirigèrent vers la porte. Mais deux conjurés arrivèrent encore ; ceux-là demeuraient sur la place de l’Hôtel-de-Ville, ils savaient qu’il restait, à la mairie, au plus une vingtaine de républicains. On délibéra de nouveau. Quarante et un contre vingt parut un chiffre possible. La distribution des armes se fit au milieu d’un petit frémissement. C’était Rougon qui puisait dans les caisses, et chacun, en recevant son fusil, dont le canon, par cette nuit de décembre, était glacé, sentait un grand froid le pénétrer et le geler jusqu’aux entrailles. Les ombres, sur les murs, prirent des attitudes bizarres de conscrits embarrassés, écartant leurs dix doigts. Pierre referma les caisses avec regret ; il laissait là cent neuf fusils qu’il aurait distribués de bon cœur ; ensuite il passa au partage des cartouches. Il y en avait, au fond de la remise, deux grands tonneaux, pleins jusqu’aux bords, de quoi défendre Plassans contre une armée. Et, comme ce coin n’était pas éclairé, et qu’un de ces messieurs apportait le rat de cave, un autre des conjurés – c’était un gros charcutier qui avait des poings de géant – se fâcha, disant qu’il n’était pas du tout prudent d’approcher ainsi la lumière. On l’approuva fort. Les cartouches furent distribuées en pleine obscurité. Ils s’en emplirent les poches à les faire crever. Puis, quand ils furent prêts, quand ils eurent chargé leurs armes avec des précautions infinies, ils restèrent là un instant, à se regarder d’un air louche, en échangeant des regards où de la cruauté lâche luisait dans de la bêtise.","However, the reactionary band numbered itself, and, faced with its small number, it hesitated. We were only thirty-nine, we were sure to be massacred; a father spoke of his children; others, without alleging a pretext, headed for the door. But two conspirators still arrived; these lived in the Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville, they knew that there remained at the town hall at most a score of Republicans. We deliberated again. Forty-one against twenty seemed a possible number. The distribution of arms took place amidst a slight tremor. It was Rougon who drew from the chests, and each, on receiving his gun, the barrel of which, on this December night, was frozen, felt a great cold penetrating it and freezing it to the very core. The shadows on the walls assumed the bizarre attitudes of embarrassed conscripts, spreading their ten fingers. Pierre closed the boxes with regret; he left there a hundred and nine muskets which he would have distributed with a good heart; then he moved on to the division of cartridges. There were, at the back of the shed, two large barrels, full to the brim, enough to defend Plassans against an army. And, as this corner was not lighted, and one of these gentlemen was bringing the cellar rat, another of the conspirators - he was a fat pork butcher who had giant fists - became angry, saying that he did not It was not at all prudent to approach the light like this. It was strongly approved. The cartridges were distributed in complete darkness. They stuffed their pockets with them until they burst. Then, when they were ready, when they had loaded their weapons with infinite precaution, they stood there for a moment, looking at each other suspiciously, exchanging looks in which cowardly cruelty shone in stupidity.","However, the reactionary forces counted their numbers, and the smallness of the total filled them with hesitation. They were only thirty-nine all told, and this adventure would mean certain death for them. A father of a family spoke of his children; others, without troubling themselves about excuses, turned towards the door. Then, however, two fresh conspirators arrived, who lived in the neighbourhood of the Town Hall, and knew for certain that there were not more than about twenty Republicans still at the mayor’s. The band thereupon deliberated afresh. Forty-one against twenty—these seemed practicable conditions. So the arms were distributed amid a little trembling. It was Rougon who took them from the boxes, and each man present, as he received his gun, the barrel of which on that December night was icy cold, felt a sudden chill freeze him to his bones. The shadows on the walls assumed the clumsy postures of bewildered conscripts stretching out their fingers. Pierre closed the boxes regretfully; he left there a hundred and nine guns which he would willingly have distributed; however, he now had to divide the cartridges. Of these, there were two large barrels full in the furthest corner of the cart-shed, sufficient to defend Plassans against an army. And as this corner was dark, one of the gentlemen brought the taper near, whereupon another conspirator—a burly pork-butcher, with immense fists—grew angry, declaring that it was most imprudent to bring a light so close. They strongly approved his words, so the cartridges were distributed in the dark. They completely filled their pockets with them. Then, after they had loaded their guns, with endless precautions, they lingered there for another moment, looking at each other with suspicious eyes, or exchanging glances in which cowardly ferocity was mingled with an expression of stupidity.","This little band of reactionaries counted their numbers, and the modest total filled them with apprehension.

All heartily agreed, so the cartridges were distributed in complete darkness. They stuffed their pockets with them. Then, after they had loaded their guns most carefully, they lingered for another moment, looking at each other suspiciously or exchanging glances in which cowardice and brutality were mingled with stupidity."
"Et, d’elle-même, elle attira Silvère contre sa poitrine.","And, of her own accord, she drew Silvere to her bosom.","Forthwith she clasped Silvère to her bosom, and, still with her arms about him, murmured: “We shall grow so cold; come close to me that we may be warm.”","She drew Silvère to her and, with her arms round him, murmured:"

"Il prononça ces derniers mots avec quelque ironie, raillant doucement les menées de son père et de l’oncle Antoine. Silvère fut heureux de rencontrer son cousin ; le docteur était le seul des Rougon qui lui serrât la main dans les rues et qui lui témoignât une sincère amitié. Aussi, en le voyant couvert encore de la poussière de la route, et le croyant acquis à la cause républicaine, le jeune homme montra-t-il une vive joie. Il lui parla des droits du peuple, de sa cause sainte, de son triomphe assuré, avec une emphase juvénile. Pascal l’écoutait en souriant ; il examinait avec curiosité ses gestes, les jeux ardents de sa physionomie, comme s’il eût étudié un sujet, disséqué un enthousiasme, pour voir ce qu’il y a au fond de cette fièvre généreuse.","He uttered these last words with some irony, gently mocking the intrigues of his father and Uncle Antoine.

So, seeing him still covered with the dust of the road, and believing him won over to the republican cause, the young man showed great joy. He spoke to her of the rights of the people, of their holy cause, of their assured triumph, with youthful emphasis. Pascal listened to him with a smile; he examined with curiosity his gestures, the ardent games of his countenance, as if he had studied a subject, dissected an enthusiasm, to see what lay at the bottom of this generous fever.","He spoke these last words with a touch of irony, as if deriding the intrigues of his father and his uncle Antoine.

Seeing him, therefore, still covered with dust from the march, the young man thought him gained over to the Republican cause, and was much delighted thereat. He talked to the doctor, with youthful magniloquence, of the people’s rights, their holy cause, and their certain triumph. Pascal smiled as he listened, and watched the youth’s gestures and the ardent play of his features with curiosity, as though he were studying a patient, or analysing an enthusiasm, to ascertain what might be at the bottom of it.","He said these last words with a touch of irony, as if gently mocking the intrigues of his father and his uncle Antoine.

"– Me trahiras-tu si je te dis que je le crois ? répondit en riant le marquis. J’en ai fait mon deuil, petite. Je suis un vieux bonhomme fini et enterré. C’est pour toi, d’ailleurs, que je travaillais. Puisque tu as su trouver sans moi le bon chemin, je me consolerai en te voyant triompher de ma défaite… Surtout ne joue plus le mystère. Viens à moi, si tu es embarrassée. »","""Will you betray me if I tell you I believe him?"" replied the marquis, laughing. I mourned it, little one. I am a finished and buried old man.

Come to me, if you're embarrassed. »","“Will you betray me if I tell you that I believe so?” the marquis laughingly replied. “I’ve donned my mourning over it, little one.

"La société habituelle du salon, quand elle fut réunie, ne put cacher l’admiration que lui causa un pareil spectacle. Ces messieurs souriaient d’un air embarrassé, en échangeant des regards sournois qui signifiaient clairement : « Ces Rougon sont fous, ils jettent leur argent par la fenêtre. » La vérité était que Félicité, en allant faire les invitations, n’avait pu retenir sa langue. Tout le monde savait que Pierre était décoré et qu’on allait le nommer quelque chose ; ce qui allongeait les nez singulièrement, selon l’expression de la vieille femme. Puis, disait Roudier : « Cette noiraude se gonflait par trop. » Au jour des récompenses, la bande de ces bourgeois qui s’étaient rués sur la République expirante, en s’observant les uns les autres, en se faisant gloire chacun de donner un coup de dent plus bruyant que celui du voisin, trouvaient mauvais que leurs hôtes eussent tous les lauriers de la bataille. Ceux mêmes qui avaient hurlé par tempérament, sans rien demander à l’Empire naissant, étaient profondément vexés de voir que, grâce à eux, le plus pauvre, le plus taré de tous allait avoir le ruban rouge à la boutonnière.","The usual company of the drawing-room, when assembled, could not conceal the admiration which such a spectacle caused them. These gentlemen smiled with an embarrassed air, exchanging sly glances which clearly meant: “These Rougons are crazy, they throw their money out the window. The truth was that Felicite, going to make the invitations, had not been able to hold her tongue. Everyone knew that Pierre was decorated and that they were going to name him something; which lengthened the noses singularly, according to the expression of the old woman. Then, said Roudier: ""This swarthy swelled up too much."" On the day of the rewards, the band of these bourgeois who had rushed upon the dying Republic, while observing each other, each boasting of giving a louder bite than that of the neighbor, found it bad that their hosts had all the laurels of the battle. Even those who had screamed out of temper, without asking anything of the nascent Empire, were deeply annoyed to see that, thanks to them, the poorest, most insane of all was going to have the red ribbon in his buttonhole.","When the habitual guests of the yellow drawing-room were assembled there they could not conceal their admiration of the spectacle. Several gentlemen smiled with an air of embarrassment while they exchanged furtive glances, which clearly signified, “These Rougons are mad, they are throwing their money out of the window.” The truth was that Félicité, on going round to invite her guests, had been unable to hold her tongue. So everybody knew that Pierre had been decorated, and that he was about to be nominated to some post; at which, of course, they pulled wry faces. Roudier indeed observed that “the little black woman was puffing herself out too much.” Now that “prize-day” had come this band of bourgeois, who had rushed upon the expiring Republic—each one keeping an eye on the other, and glorying in giving a deeper bite than his neighbour— did not think it fair that their hosts should have all the laurels of the battle. Even those who had merely howled by instinct, asking no recompense of the rising Empire, were greatly annoyed to see that, thanks to them, the poorest and least reputable of them all should be decorated with the red ribbon.","When the usual guests had assembled they could not hide their admiration. They smiled in a rather embarrassed way, while exchanging furtive glances which clearly signified: ‘These Rougons are mad, they are throwing their money out of the window.’ The truth was that Félicité, when she went round to invite her guests, had been unable to hold her tongue. Everybody knew that Pierre had been decorated and was about to be appointed to some important post; this, as Félicité kept saying, had made them all green with envy. Indeed, Roudier observed that ‘that little woman was puffing herself up too much’. Now that the time for rewards had arrived, this gang of bourgeois, who had thrown themselves on the dying Republic, each one keeping a watchful eye on the others and proud of taking a bigger bite than his neighbour, did not think it fair that their hosts should have all the glory. Even those who had bared their teeth out of pure instinct, without expecting some form of reward from the new Imperial regime, were most annoyed to see that, thanks to them, the poorest and least distinguished of them should be decorated with the red ribbon."
"Aux premiers hommes qui entrèrent dans la clarté, Miette, d’un mouvement instinctif, se serra contre Silvère, bien qu’elle se sentît en sûreté, à l’abri même des regards. Elle passa le bras au cou du jeune homme, appuya la tête contre son épaule.

"Et Granoux, dans la foule, recevait des félicitations et des poignées de main. On connaissait l’histoire du marteau.

Cela doubla son importance. Son exploit fut déclaré prodigieux. On ne l’appela plus que : « Monsieur Isidore, vous savez ? le monsieur qui a sonné le tocsin avec un marteau ! » Bien que la phrase fût un peu longue, Granoux l’eût prise volontiers comme titre nobiliaire ; et l’on ne put désormais prononcer devant lui le mot « marteau », sans qu’il crût à une délicate flatterie.","And Granoux, in the crowd, received congratulations and handshakes.

What are you doing here, my lad?’ he exclaimed on seeing Silvère. ‘I thought I was the only member of the family here.’"
"Antoine chercha donc à attirer Silvère chez lui, en affichant une admiration immodérée pour les idées du jeune homme. Dès le début, il faillit tout compromettre : il avait une façon intéressée de considérer le triomphe de la République, comme une ère d’heureuse fainéantise et de mangeailles sans fin, qui froissa les aspirations purement morales de son neveu. Il comprit qu’il faisait fausse route, il se jeta dans un pathos étrange, dans une enfilade de mots creux et sonores, que Silvère accepta comme une preuve suffisante de civisme. Bientôt l’oncle et le neveu se virent deux et trois fois par semaine. Pendant leurs longues discussions, où le sort du pays était carrément décidé, Antoine essaya de persuader au jeune homme que le salon des Rougon était le principal obstacle au bonheur de la France. Mais, de nouveau, il fit fausse route en appelant sa mère « vieille coquine » devant Silvère. Il alla jusqu’à lui raconter les anciens scandales de la pauvre vieille. Le jeune homme, rouge de honte, l’écouta sans l’interrompre. Il ne lui demandait pas ces choses, il fut navré d’une pareille confidence, qui le blessait dans ses tendresses respectueuses pour tante Dide. À partir de ce jour, il entoura sa grand-mère de plus de soins, il eut pour elle de bons sourires et de bons regards de pardon. D’ailleurs, Macquart s’était aperçu qu’il avait commis une bêtise, et il s’efforçait d’utiliser les tendresses de Silvère en accusant les Rougon de l’isolement et de la pauvreté d’Adélaïde. À l’entendre, lui avait toujours été le meilleur des fils, mais son frère s’était conduit d’une façon ignoble ; il avait dépouillé sa mère, et aujourd’hui qu’elle n’avait plus le sou, il rougissait d’elle. C’était, sur ce sujet, des bavardages sans fin. Silvère s’indignait contre l’oncle Pierre, au grand contentement de l’oncle Antoine.","Antoine therefore sought to attract Silvere to his home, displaying an immoderate admiration for the ideas of the young man. From the start, he almost compromised everything: he had an interested way of regarding the triumph of the Republic, as an era of happy laziness and endless eating, which offended the purely moral aspirations of his nephew. He understood that he was on the wrong track, he threw himself into a strange pathos, into a succession of hollow and resonant words, which Silvere accepted as sufficient proof of civility. Soon the uncle and nephew saw each other two or three times a week. During their long discussions, where the fate of the country was squarely decided, Antoine tried to persuade the young man that the Rougon salon was the main obstacle to the happiness of France. But, again, he took the wrong road by calling his mother ""old rascal"" in front of Silvere. He went so far as to tell her of the old scandals of the poor old woman. The young man, flushed with shame, listened without interrupting. He did not ask her these things, he was heartbroken by such a confidence, which wounded his respectful tenderness for Aunt Dide. From that day on, he surrounded his grandmother with more care, he gave her good smiles and good looks of forgiveness. Besides, Macquart had perceived that he had committed a mistake, and he endeavored to make use of Silvere's tenderness by accusing the Rougons of Adelaide's isolation and poverty. According to him, he had always been the best of sons, but his brother had behaved in a despicable way; he had robbed his mother, and today that she had no more money, he blushed for her. There was endless chatter on this subject. Silvere was indignant with Uncle Pierre, to the great satisfaction of Uncle Antoine.","Such being Antoine’s scheme, he tried to induce Silvère to visit him, by professing inordinate admiration for the young man’s ideas. But he very nearly compromised the whole matter at the outset. He had a way of regarding the triumph of the Republic as a question of personal interest, as an era of happy idleness and endless junketing, which chilled his nephew’s purely moral aspirations. However, he perceived that he was on the wrong track, and plunged into strange bathos, a string of empty but high-sounding words, which Silvère accepted as a satisfactory proof of his civism. Before long the uncle and the nephew saw each other two or three times a week. During their long discussions, in which the fate of the country was flatly settled, Antoine endeavoured to persuade the young man that the Rougons’ drawing-room was the chief obstacle to the welfare of France. But he again made a false move by calling his mother “old jade” in Silvère’s presence. He even repeated to him the early scandals about the poor woman. The young man blushed for shame, but listened without interruption. He had not asked his uncle for this information; he felt heart-broken by such confidences, which wounded his feeling of respectful affection for aunt Dide. From that time forward he lavished yet more attention upon his grandmother, greeting her always with pleasant smiles and looks of forgiveness. However, Macquart felt that he had acted foolishly, and strove to take advantage of Silvère’s affection for Adélaïde by charging the Rougons with her forlornness and poverty. According to him, he had always been the best of sons, whereas his brother had behaved disgracefully; Pierre had robbed his mother, and now, when she was penniless, he was ashamed of her. He never ceased descanting on this subject. Silvère thereupon became indignant with his uncle Pierre, much to the satisfaction of his uncle Antoine.","Antoine sought to induce Silvère to visit him by professing inordinate admiration for the young man’s ideas.

He claimed that he had always been the best of sons, whereas his brother had behaved disgracefully; Pierre had robbed his mother, and now that she was penniless he was ashamed of her. He never stopped harping on the subject. Silvère soon expressed his anger towards his uncle Pierre, much to the satisfaction of his uncle Antoine."
"« Oui, marchons, répondit-elle vivement, allons jusqu’au moulin… Je passerais la nuit, si tu voulais. »","“Yes, let’s walk,” she replied quickly, “let’s go to the mill… I could spend the night, if you wanted. »","“Yes, let us walk a little,” she eagerly replied. “Let us go as far as the mill. I could pass the whole night like this if you wanted to.”","‘Yes, let’s have a little walk,’ she replied enthusiastically. ‘Let’s go to the mill. I could stay out all night if you want.’"
"« En haut, continua Rougon de sa voix la plus forte, sans laisser à l’agitation le temps de se calmer, en haut, nous avions fort à faire. La lutte a été rude… »","""Upstairs,"" continued Rougon in his loudest voice, ""without giving the agitation time to calm down, ""upstairs we had a lot to do. The fight was tough…”","“Meantime,” continued Rougon at the top of his voice, without giving time for the excitement to abate; “meantime we had plenty to do upstairs. The struggle was quite desperate.”","‘In the meantime,’ continued Rougon at the top of his voice, without allowing time for the excitement to subside, ‘in the meantime we had plenty to do upstairs. There was quite a struggle.’"
"D’ailleurs, la jeune femme ne regarda pas cette marmaille comme une cause de ruine. Au contraire, elle reconstruisit sur la tête de ses fils l’édifice de sa fortune, qui s’écroulait entre ses mains. Ils n’avaient pas dix ans, qu’elle escomptait déjà en rêve leur avenir. Doutant de jamais réussir par elle-même, elle se mit à espérer en eux pour vaincre l’acharnement du sort. Ils satisferaient ses vanités déçues, ils lui donneraient cette position riche et enviée qu’elle poursuivait en vain. Dès lors, sans abandonner la lutte soutenue par la maison de commerce, elle eut une seconde tactique pour arriver à contenter ses instincts de domination. Il lui semblait impossible que, sur ses trois fils, il n’y eût pas un homme supérieur qui les enrichirait tous. Elle sentait cela, disait-elle. Aussi soigna-t-elle les marmots avec une ferveur où il y avait des sévérités de mère et des tendresses d’usurier. Elle se plut à les engraisser amoureusement comme un capital qui devait plus tard rapporter de gros intérêts.","Besides, the young woman did not regard this brat as a cause of ruin. On the contrary, she rebuilt on the heads of her sons the edifice of her fortune, which was crumbling in her hands. They weren't ten years old when she was already dreaming about their future. Doubting that she would ever succeed on her own, she began to hope in them to overcome the relentlessness of fate. They would satisfy her disappointed vanities, they would give her that rich and envied position which she pursued in vain. From then on, without abandoning the struggle supported by the trading house, she had a second tactic to succeed in satisfying her instincts of domination. It seemed to him impossible that, out of his three sons, there should not be a superior man who would enrich them all. She felt that, she said. So she took care of the brats with a fervor in which there was the severity of a mother and the tenderness of a loan shark. She took pleasure in fattening them lovingly like a capital which was later to bring in high interest.","However, the young woman did not regard this troop of children as the cause of their ruin. On the contrary, she based on her sons’ heads the building of the fortune which was crumbling in her own hands. They were hardly ten years old before she discounted their future careers in her dreams. Doubting whether she would ever succeed herself, she centred in them all her hopes of overcoming the animosity of fate. They would provide satisfaction for her disappointed vanity, they would give her that wealthy, honourable position which she had hitherto sought in vain. From that time forward, without abandoning the business struggle, she conceived a second plan for obtaining the gratification of her domineering instincts. It seemed to her impossible that, amongst her three sons, there should not be a man of superior intellect, who would enrich them all. She felt it, she said. Accordingly, she nursed the children with a fervour in which maternal severity was blended with an usurer’s solicitude. She amused herself by fattening them as though they constituted a capital which, later on, would return a large interest.","However, the young woman did not regard this brood of children as the cause of their poverty. On the contrary, she now saw her sons as the future architects of the fortune she was unable to make on her own. They were hardly ten years old when she began to dream about their future careers. Doubting whether she would ever achieve success for herself, she invested in them all her hopes of overcoming the tribulations of fate. They would satisfy her frustrated vanity, and give her the wealth and eminence she had so far failed to achieve. From that time onwards, without abandoning their commercial ambitions, she conceived a second plan for the satisfaction of her domineering instincts. It seemed to her impossible that, amongst her three sons, there should not be a man of superior talent, who would make them all rich. She could feel it in her bones, she said. Accordingly, she looked after the children with a devotion that blended a mother’s strictness with a usurer’s attentiveness. She delighted in fattening them as though they represented a capital investment which, later on, would pay considerable dividends."
"« Ne vous réjouissez pas. Je viens de trouver ma pauvre grand-mère au plus mal.

"Elle était trop morte déjà pour avoir les effusions bavardes des grand-mères bonnes et grasses ; elle adorait l’orphelin secrètement, avec des pudeurs de jeune fille, sans pouvoir trouver des caresses. Parfois, elle le prenait sur ses genoux, elle le regardait longuement de ses yeux pâles. Lorsque le petit, effrayé par ce visage blanc et muet, se mettait à sangloter, elle paraissait confuse de ce qu’elle venait de faire, elle le remettait vite sur le sol sans l’embrasser. Peut-être lui trouvait-elle une lointaine ressemblance avec le braconnier Macquart.","She was already too dead to have the talkative effusions of good, fat grandmothers; she adored the orphan secretly, with the modesty of a young girl, without being able to find any caresses.

When the little one, frightened by this white and mute face, started to sob, she seemed confused about what she had just done, she quickly put him back on the ground without kissing him.

"Cependant, malgré le froid vif, tout le monde se trouvait aux fenêtres. Félicité, se penchant à la sienne, au risque de tomber, était toute pâle de joie. Justement Aristide venait d’arriver avec un numéro de l’Indépendant, dans lequel il s’était nettement déclaré en faveur du coup d’État, qu’il accueillait « comme l’aurore de la liberté dans l’ordre et de l’ordre dans la liberté ». Et il avait fait aussi une délicate allusion au salon jaune, reconnaissant ses torts, disant que « la jeunesse est présomptueuse », et que « les grands citoyens se taisent, réfléchissent dans le silence et laissent passer les insultes, pour se dresser debout dans leur héroïsme au jour de lutte ». Il était surtout content de cette phrase. Sa mère trouva l’article supérieurement écrit. Elle embrassa le cher enfant, le mit à sa droite.

"Tous les habitués du salon jaune, à la vérité, n’avaient pas l’épaisseur de cette oie grasse. Un riche propriétaire, M.

"Les jeunes gens traversèrent le faubourg endormi sans échanger une parole. Ils retrouvaient, avec une muette joie, le charme tiède de leur étreinte. Leurs cœurs étaient tristes, la félicité qu’ils goûtaient à se serrer l’un contre l’autre avait l’émotion douloureuse d’un adieu, et il leur semblait qu’ils n’épuiseraient jamais la douceur et l’amertume de ce silence qui berçait lentement leur marche. Bientôt, les maisons devinrent plus rares, ils arrivèrent à l’extrémité du faubourg. Là, s’ouvre le portail du Jas-Meiffren, deux forts piliers reliés par une grille, qui laisse voir, entre ses barreaux, une longue allée de mûriers. En passant, Silvère et Miette jetèrent instinctivement un regard dans la propriété.","The young people crossed the sleeping suburb without exchanging a word.

There stands the entrance to the Jas-Meiffren, an iron gate fixed to two strong pillars; a low row of mulberry-trees being visible through the bars.

"Les deux cloches causaient toujours sinistrement entre elles, dans l’abîme noir qui se creusait autour des jeunes gens. Miette, frissonnante, effrayée, n’osa pas se rapprocher de Silvère. Elle ne savait même plus s’il était là, elle ne l’entendait plus faire un mouvement. Tous deux étaient pleins de la sensation âcre de leur baiser ; des effusions leur montaient aux lèvres, ils auraient voulu se remercier, s’embrasser encore ; mais ils étaient si honteux de leur bonheur cuisant, qu’ils eussent mieux aimé ne jamais le goûter une seconde fois, que d’en parler tout haut. Longtemps encore, si leur marche rapide n’avait fouetté leur sang, si la nuit épaisse ne s’était faite complice, ils se seraient embrassés sur les joues, comme de bons camarades. La pudeur venait à Miette. Après l’ardent baiser de Silvère, dans ces heureuses ténèbres où son cœur s’ouvrait, elle se rappela les grossièretés de Justin. Quelques heures auparavant, elle avait écouté sans rougir ce garçon, qui la traitait de fille perdue ; il demandait à quand le baptême, il lui criait que son père la délivrerait à coups de pied, si jamais elle s’avisait de rentrer au Jas-Meiffren, et elle avait pleuré sans comprendre, elle avait pleuré parce qu’elle devinait que tout cela devait être ignoble. Maintenant qu’elle devenait femme, elle se disait, avec ses innocences dernières, que le baiser, dont elle sentait encore la brûlure en elle, suffisait peut-être pour l’emplir de cette honte dont son cousin l’accusait. Alors elle fut prise de douleur, elle sanglota.","The two bells were still chatting ominously among themselves, in the black abyss which grew hollow around the young people. Miette, shivering, frightened, did not dare approach Silvere. She didn't even know if he was there anymore, she couldn't hear him move. Both were full of the acrid sensation of their kiss; effusions rose to their lips, they would have liked to thank each other, to embrace each other again; but they were so ashamed of their burning happiness that they would have preferred never to taste it a second time than to speak of it aloud. For a long time yet, if their rapid walk had not whipped up their blood, if the thick night had not made itself an accomplice, they would have kissed each other on the cheeks, like good comrades. Modesty came to Miette. After Silvere's ardent kiss, in that happy darkness where her heart was opening, she remembered Justin's rudeness. A few hours before, she had listened without blushing to this boy, who called her a lost girl; he asked when the baptism, he shouted to her that her father would deliver her with kicks, if she ever dared to go back to Jas-Meiffren, and she wept without understanding, she wept because she guessed that everything it must have been despicable. Now that she was becoming a woman, she said to herself, with her last innocence, that the kiss, the burning of which she still felt within her, was perhaps enough to fill her with that shame of which her cousin accused her. Then she was seized with pain, she sobbed.","Meantime the bells were keeping up their sinister converse in the dark abyss which surrounded the young people. Miette, trembling and frightened, did not dare to draw near to Silvère again. She did not even know if he were still there, for she could no longer hear him move. The stinging sweetness of their kiss still clung to their lips, to which passionate phrases surged, and they longed to kiss once more. But shame restrained them from the expression of any such desire. They felt that they would rather never taste that bliss again than speak of it aloud. If their blood had not been lashed by their rapid march, if the darkness had not offered complicity, they would, for a long time yet, have continued kissing each other on the cheeks like old playfellows. Feelings of modesty were coming to Miette. She remembered Justin’s coarseness. A few hours previously she had listened, without a blush, to that fellow who called her a shameless girl. She had wept without understanding his meaning, she had wept simply because she guessed that what he spoke of must be base. Now that she was becoming a woman, she wondered in a last innocent transport whether that kiss, whose burning smart she could still feel, would not perhaps suffice to cover her with the shame to which her cousin had referred. Thereupon she was seized with remorse, and burst into sobs.","The two bells were keeping up their sinister exchange in the darkness. Miette, trembling and frightened, did not dare to draw near to Silvère again. She did not even know if he was still there, for she could no longer hear him move. The bitter sweetness of their kiss still clung to their lips, to which passionate words were rising. They longed to kiss once more, but shame at their feelings of excitement prevented them from speaking; they thought that they would rather never taste that bliss again than speak it out loud. If the march of the little army had not stirred their blood, if the darkness had not offered complicity, they would have continued kissing each other on the cheeks like friends. Miette felt a fresh wave of embarrassment. After Silvère’s passionate kiss, in that loving darkness in which her feelings were aroused, she remembered Justin’s coarse remarks. A few hours before he had called her a shameless creature; he had asked her when the christening would be, and had yelled that his father would deliver the child with a few kicks if she ever tried to go back to the Jas-Meiffren; and she had wept without understanding what he meant, she had wept because she had felt that what he had said must be vile. Now that she was becoming a woman, she wondered, in a last innocent thought, whether that kiss, which she could still feel burning her lips, would be enough to cover her with the shame of which her cousin had accused her. She became distressed, and began to sob."
"Chez Ursule, au contraire, la ressemblance physique et morale de la jeune femme l’emportait ; c’était toujours un mélange intime ; seulement la pauvre petite, née la seconde, à l’heure où les tendresses d’Adélaïde dominaient l’amour déjà plus calme de Macquart, semblait avoir reçu avec son sexe l’empreinte plus profonde du tempérament de sa mère. D’ailleurs, il n’y avait plus ici une fusion des deux natures, mais plutôt une juxtaposition, une soudure singulièrement étroite. Ursule, fantasque, montrait par moments des sauvageries, des tristesses, des emportements de paria ; puis, le plus souvent, elle riait par éclats nerveux, elle rêvait avec mollesse, en femme folle du cœur et de la tête. Ses yeux, où passaient les regards effarés d’Adélaïde, étaient d’une limpidité de cristal, comme ceux des jeunes chats qui doivent mourir d’étisie.","With Ursule, on the contrary, the physical and moral resemblance of the young woman prevailed; it was always an intimate mixture; only the poor little one, born the second, at the hour when the tenderness of Adelaide dominated the already calmer love of Macquart, seemed to have received with her sex the deeper impress of her mother's temperament. Moreover, there was no longer a fusion of the two natures here, but rather a juxtaposition, a singularly close weld. Ursule, whimsical, showed at times wildness, sadness, outbursts of pariah; then, more often than not, she laughed nervously, she dreamed softly, like a woman mad in heart and mind. Her eyes, through which Adelaide's bewildered gaze passed, were crystal clear, like those of young cats who are about to die of etisia.","In Ursule, on the other hand, physical and moral resemblance to the mother predominated. There was a mixture of certain characteristics in her also; but born the last, at a time when Adélaïde’s love was warmer than Macquart’s, the poor little thing seemed to have received with her sex a deeper impress of her mother’s temperament. Moreover, hers was not a fusion of the two natures, but rather a juxtaposition, a remarkably close soldering. Ursule was whimsical, and displayed at times the shyness, the melancholy, and the transports of a pariah; then she would often break out into nervous fits of laughter, and muse lazily, like a woman unsound both in head and heart. Her eyes, which at times had a scared expression like those of Adélaïde, were as limpid as crystal, similar to those of kittens doomed to die of consumption.","In Ursule, on the other hand, physical and moral resemblance to the mother predominated.

"Lorsque la demie sonna à l’horloge voisine, il fut tiré en sursaut de sa rêverie. En se voyant blanc de lumière, il regarda devant lui avec inquiétude. D’un mouvement brusque, il rentra dans le noir, mais il ne put retrouver le fil de sa rêverie. Il sentit alors que ses pieds et ses mains se glaçaient, et l’impatience le reprit. Il monta de nouveau jeter un coup d’œil dans le Jas-Meiffren, toujours silencieux et vide. Puis, ne sachant plus comment tuer le temps, il redescendit, prit son fusil dans le tas de planches, où il l’avait caché, et s’amusa à en faire jouer la batterie. Cette arme était une longue et lourde carabine qui avait sans doute appartenu à quelque contrebandier ; à l’épaisseur de la crosse et à la culasse puissante du canon, on reconnaissait un ancien fusil à pierre qu’un armurier du pays avait transformé en fusil à piston. On voit de ces carabines-là accrochées dans les fermes, au-dessus des cheminées. Le jeune homme caressait son arme avec amour ; il rabattit le chien à plus de vingt reprises, introduisit son petit doigt dans le canon, examina attentivement la crosse. Peu à peu, il s’anima d’un jeune enthousiasme, auquel se mêlait quelque enfantillage. Il finit par mettre la carabine en joue, visant dans le vide, comme un conscrit qui fait l’exercice.","When the next clock struck half past, he was jerked out of his reverie. Seeing himself white with light, he looked ahead with concern. With a sudden movement, he reentered the darkness, but he could not find the thread of his reverie. He then felt that his feet and hands froze, and impatience seized him again. He went up again to take a look at the Jas-Meiffren, still silent and empty. Then, no longer knowing how to kill time, he went down again, took his gun from the heap of planks where he had hidden it, and amused himself by playing the drums. This weapon was a long, heavy carbine that must have belonged to some smuggler; by the thickness of the butt and the powerful breech of the barrel, one recognized an old flintlock rifle that a local gunsmith had transformed into a piston rifle. One sees these rifles hung in the farms, above the chimneys. The young man caressed his weapon lovingly; he knocked down the hammer more than twenty times, introduced his little finger into the barrel, examined the stock attentively. Gradually he became animated by a youthful enthusiasm, with which was mingled a certain childishness. He ends up aiming the rifle, aiming into space, like a conscript doing drills.","As the neighbouring clock struck the half hour, he suddenly started from his reverie. Perceiving that the white moonlight was shining full upon him, he gazed anxiously ahead. Then he abruptly dived back into the shade, but was unable to recover the thread of his thoughts. He now realised that his hands and feet were becoming very cold, and impatience seized hold of him. So he jumped upon the stone again, and once more glanced over the Jas-Meiffren, which was still empty and silent. Finally, at a loss how to employ his time, he jumped down, fetched his gun from the pile of planks where he had concealed it, and amused himself by working the trigger. The weapon was a long, heavy carbine, which had doubtless belonged to some smuggler. The thickness of the butt and the breech of the barrel showed it to be an old flintlock which had been altered into a percussion gun by some local gunsmith. Such firearms are to be found in farmhouses, hanging against the wall over the chimney-piece. The young man caressed his weapon with affection; twenty times or more he pulled the trigger, thrust his little finger into the barrel, and examined the butt attentively. By degrees he grew full of youth enthusiasm, combined with childish frolicsomeness, and ended by levelling his weapon and aiming at space, like a recruit going through his drill.","As the neighbouring clock struck the half-hour, he suddenly started from his reverie.

So he jumped onto the stone again, and once more glanced across at the Jas-Meiffren, which was still empty and silent.

"Au fond, une curiosité anxieuse continuait à la torturer ; elle étudiait les moindres gestes de Pierre, elle tâchait de comprendre. S’il allait faire fausse route ? Si Eugène l’entraînait à sa suite dans quelque casse-cou d’où ils sortiraient plus affamés et plus pauvres ? Cependant la foi lui venait. Eugène avait commandé avec une telle autorité, qu’elle finissait par croire en lui. Là encore agissait la puissance de l’inconnu. Pierre lui parlait mystérieusement des hauts personnages que son fils aîné fréquentait à Paris ; elle-même ignorait ce qu’il pouvait y faire, tandis qu’il lui était impossible de fermer les yeux sur les coups de tête commis par Aristide à Plassans. Dans son propre salon, on ne se gênait guère pour traiter le journaliste démocrate avec la dernière sévérité. Granoux l’appelait brigand entre ses dents, et Roudier, deux ou trois fois par semaine, répétait à Félicité :","Deep down, an anxious curiosity continued to torment her; she studied Pierre's slightest gestures, she tried to understand. If he was going to go wrong? What if Eugene dragged him off into some daredevil from which they would emerge hungrier and poorer? However, faith came to him. Eugene had commanded with such authority that she ended up believing in him. Here again was the power of the unknown. Pierre spoke to her mysteriously of the high personages whom her eldest son frequented in Paris; she herself did not know what he could do there, while it was impossible for her to close her eyes to the whims committed by Aristide at Plassans. In his own living room, there was no hesitation in treating the Democratic journalist with the utmost severity. Granoux called him a brigand between his teeth, and Roudier, two or three times a week, repeated to Félicité:","In reality, she was still tortured by anxious curiosity; she studied Pierre’s slightest actions, endeavouring to discover their meaning. What if by chance he were following the wrong track? What if Eugène were dragging them in his train into some break-neck pit, whence they would emerge yet more hungry and impoverished? However, faith was dawning on her. Eugène had commanded with such an air of authority that she ultimately came to believe in him. In this case again some unknown power was at work. Pierre would speak mysteriously of the high personages whom their eldest son visited in Paris. For her part she did not know what he could have to do with them, but on the other hand she was unable to close her eyes to Aristide’s ill-advised acts at Plassans. The visitors to her drawing-room did not scruple to denounce the democratic journalist with extreme severity. Granoux muttered that he was a brigand, and Roudier would three or four times a week repeat to Félicité: “Your son is writing some fine articles.","In reality, she continued to be tortured by curiosity; she studied Pierre’s slightest actions in an attempt to discover their meaning. What if he was on the wrong track? What if Eugène was dragging him into some reckless plot that would leave them even worse off? However, she was beginning to have faith. Eugène had given his orders with such authority that she was beginning to believe in him. Once again some unknown power was at work. Pierre would speak mysteriously of the very important people their eldest son frequented in Paris; Félicité could not imagine what he might have to do with them, but on the other hand she could not close her eyes to Aristide’s impulsive behaviour in Plassans. The visitors to her drawing-room made no attempt to hide their low opinion of the democratic journalist. Granoux muttered that he was a crook, and two or three times a week Roudier would repeat to Félicité:"

"Félicité comprit la profondeur de ces paroles. Dès lors, elle cessa d’accuser ses enfants, elle tourna sa colère contre le sort, qui ne se lassait pas de la frapper. Elle recommença ses doléances, elle se mit à geindre de plus belle sur le manque de fortune qui la faisait échouer au port. Quand Rougon lui disait : « Tes fils sont des fainéants, ils nous grugeront jusqu’à la fin », elle répondait aigrement : « Plût à Dieu que j’eusse encore de l’argent à leur donner. S’ils végètent, les pauvres garçons, c’est qu’ils n’ont pas le sou. »","Felicite understood the depth of these words. From then on, she stopped accusing her children, she turned her anger against fate, which never tired of hitting her. She resumed her grievances, she began to moan even more loudly about the lack of fortune which had made her run aground in port. When Rougon said to her: “Your sons are lazy, they will cheat us to the end,” she answered sourly: “Wish to God that I still had money to give them. If they vegetate, the poor boys, it's because they don't have a penny. »","Félicité understood the wisdom of these words. From that time she ceased to accuse her children, and turned her anger against fate, which never wearied of striking her. She started her old complaints afresh, and bemoaned more and more the want of means which made her strand, as it were, in port. Whenever Rougon said to her, “Your sons are lazy fellows, they will eat up all we have,” she sourly replied, “Would to God I had more money to give them; if they do vegetate, poor fellows, it’s because they haven’t got a sou to bless themselves with.”","Félicité understood the wisdom of these words.

"L’autre fils Rougon, Pascal, celui qui était né entre Eugène et Aristide, ne paraissait pas appartenir à la famille. C’était un de ces cas fréquents qui font mentir les lois de l’hérédité. La nature donne souvent ainsi naissance, au milieu d’une race, à un être dont elle puise tous les éléments dans ses forces créatrices. Rien au moral ni au physique ne rappelait les Rougon chez Pascal. Grand, le visage doux et sévère, il avait une droiture d’esprit, un amour de l’étude, un besoin de modestie, qui contrastaient singulièrement avec les fièvres d’ambition et les menées peu scrupuleuses de sa famille. Après avoir fait à Paris d’excellentes études médicales, il s’était retiré à Plassans par goût, malgré les offres de ses professeurs. Il aimait la vie calme de la province ; il soutenait que cette vie est préférable pour un savant au tapage parisien. Même à Plassans, il ne s’inquiéta nullement de grossir sa clientèle. Très sobre, ayant un beau mépris pour la fortune, il sut se contenter des quelques malades que le hasard seul lui envoya. Tout son luxe consista dans une petite maison claire de la ville neuve, où il s’enfermait religieusement, s’occupant avec amour d’histoire naturelle. Il se prit surtout d’une belle passion pour la physiologie. On sut dans la ville qu’il achetait souvent des cadavres au fossoyeur de l’hospice, ce qui le fit prendre en horreur par les dames délicates et certains bourgeois poltrons. On n’alla pas heureusement jusqu’à le traiter de sorcier ; mais sa clientèle se restreignit encore, on le regarda comme un original auquel les personnes de la bonne société ne devaient pas confier le bout de leur petit doigt, sous peine de se compromettre. On entendit la femme du maire dire un jour :","The other Rougon son, Pascal, the one who was born between Eugène and Aristide, did not seem to belong to the family. It was one of those frequent cases which belie the laws of heredity. Nature often thus gives birth, in the midst of a race, to a being from which she draws all the elements in her creative forces. Nothing morally or physically recalled the Rougons in Pascal. Tall, with a gentle and stern face, he had an upright spirit, a love of study, a need for modesty, which contrasted singularly with the fevers of ambition and the unscrupulous intrigues of his family. After having completed excellent medical studies in Paris, he retired to Plassans out of taste, despite the offers of his professors. He liked the calm life of the provinces; he maintained that this life is preferable for a scholar with Parisian uproar. Even at Plassans, he was in no way worried about increasing his clientele. Very sober, having a fine contempt for fortune, he knew how to be satisfied with the few sick people sent to him by chance alone. All his luxury consisted in a bright little house in the new town, where he shut himself up religiously, lovingly occupying himself with natural history. Above all, he developed a great passion for physiology. It was known in the town that he often bought corpses from the gravedigger of the hospice, which caused him to be held in horror by the delicate ladies and certain cowardly bourgeois. Fortunately, they did not go so far as to call him a sorcerer; but his clientele was still restricted, he was regarded as an eccentric to whom people of good society should not entrust the tip of their little finger, under pain of compromising themselves. One day the mayor's wife was heard to say:","The other son, Pascal, born between Eugène and Aristide, did not appear to belong to the family.

He loved a quiet provincial life; he maintained that for a studious man such a life was preferable to the excitement of Paris. Even at Plassans he did not exert himself to extend his practice. Very steady, and despising fortune, he contented himself with the few patients sent him by chance. All his pleasures were centred in a bright little house in the new town, where he shut himself up, lovingly devoting his whole time to the study of natural history.

"La route de Nice, aux deux côtés de laquelle se trouve bâti le faubourg, était bordée, en 1851, d’ormes séculaires, vieux géants, ruines grandioses et pleines encore de puissance, que la municipalité proprette de la ville a remplacés, depuis quelques années, par de petits platanes. Lorsque Silvère et Miette se trouvèrent sous les arbres, dont la lune dessinait le long du trottoir les branches monstrueuses, ils rencontrèrent, à deux ou trois reprises, des masses noires qui se mouvaient silencieusement, au ras des maisons. C’étaient, comme eux, des couples d’amoureux, hermétiquement clos dans un pan d’étoffe, promenant au fond de l’ombre leur tendresse discrète.","The road to Nice, on both sides of which the faubourg is built, was lined, in 1851, with century-old elms, old giants, grandiose ruins still full of power, which the clean municipality of the city has replaced, for some time past. years, by small plane trees. When Silvere and Miette found themselves under the trees, the monstrous branches of which the moon traced along the sidewalk, they encountered, on two or three occasions, black masses which moved silently, level with the houses. They were, like them, couples of lovers, hermetically enclosed in a piece of cloth, walking their discreet tenderness in the depths of the shadow.","The road to Nice, on either side of which the suburban houses are built, was, in the year 1851, lined with ancient elm-trees, grand and gigantic ruins, still full of vigour, which the fastidious town council has replaced, some years since, by some little plane-trees. When Silvère and Miette found themselves under the elms, the huge boughs of which cast shadows on the moonlit footpath, they met now and again black forms which silently skirted the house fronts. These, too, were amorous couples, closely wrapped in one and the same cloak, and strolling in the darkness.","In 1851 the Nice road, with the Faubourg on each side, was lined with ancient elm trees, grand and gigantic ruins, still full of life, which the tidy-minded town council replaced some years ago with some little plane trees. * When Silvère and Miette found themselves under the elms, whose huge boughs cast great shadows on the moonlit footpath, they encountered, several times, black shapes moving silently along close to the houses.
