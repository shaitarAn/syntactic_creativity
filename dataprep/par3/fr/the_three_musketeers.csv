Mais tout cela n'avait influé en rien sur le sentiment produit par la vue de Mme Bonacieux, et l'intérêt était resté à peu près étranger à ce commencement d'amour qui en avait été la suite.

But all that had in no way influenced the feeling produced by the sight of Madame Bonacieux, and interest had remained almost foreign to this beginning of love which had been its consequence.

Outweighed them, but didn’t eradicate them: to find that a young woman, beautiful, graceful, and spirited, was rich as well, only augmented the first bloom of love.","But, let it be said, for the moment d’Artagnan was moved by a nobler and more disinterested feeling.

"Avec un pareil vade-mecum 24, d'Artagnan se trouva, au moral comme au physique, une copie exacte du héros de Cervantes, auquel nous l'avons si heureusement comparé lorsque nos devoirs d'historien nous ont fait une nécessité de tracer son portrait. Don Quichotte prenait les moulins à vent pour des géants et les moutons pour des armées 25, d'Artagnan prit chaque sourire pour une insulte et chaque regard pour une provocation. Il en résulta qu'il eut toujours le poing fermé depuis Tarbes jusqu'à Meung, et que l'un dans l'autre il porta la main au pommeau de son épée dix fois par jour ; toutefois le poing ne descendit sur aucune mâchoire, et l'épée ne sortit point de son fourreau. Ce n'est pas que la vue du malencontreux bidet jaune n'épanouît bien des sourires sur les visages des passants ; mais, comme au-dessus du bidet sonnait une épée de taille respectable et qu'au-dessus de cette épée brillait un œil plutôt féroce que fier 26, les passants réprimaient leur hilarité, ou, si l'hilarité l'emportait sur la prudence, ils tâchaient au moins de ne rire que d'un seul côté, comme les masques antiques 27. D'Artagnan demeura donc majestueux et intact dans sa susceptibilité jusqu'à cette malheureuse ville de Meung.","With such a vade-mecum,24 d'Artagnan found himself, morally as well as physically, an exact copy of the hero of Cervantes, to whom we so happily compared him when our duties as a historian made it necessary for us to trace his portrait. Don Quixote took the windmills for giants and the sheep for armies. 25 D'Artagnan took every smile for an insult and every look for a provocation. The result was that he always had his fist closed from Tarbes to Meung, and that one in the other he raised his hand to the hilt of his sword ten times a day; however the fist did not descend on any jaw, and the sword did not come out of its scabbard. It's not that the sight of the unfortunate yellow bidet doesn't bring smiles to the faces of passers-by; but, as above the bidet rang a sword of respectable size, and above that sword shone an eye rather fierce than proud,26 the passers-by suppressed their mirth, or, if mirth prevailed over prudence they tried at least to laugh only on one side, like the ancient masks.27 D'Artagnan therefore remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility until he reached that unfortunate town of Meung.","With such endowments d’Artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of Cervantes. Don Quixote took windmills for giants and flocks of sheep for armies; d’Artagnan took every smile for an insult and every look for a provocation. So all the way from Tarbes to Meung his hand was constantly doubled into a fist or gripping the hilt of his sword. Yet the fist struck no jaw and the sword was never drawn from its scabbard. It wasn’t that the sight of the wretched yellow pony didn’t raise smiles on the faces of passersby, it was that a sword of intimidating length bumped against the side of that pony, while over the sword glared an eye as fierce as it was proud. So the passersby suppressed their amusement, or if amusement outweighed caution, they laughed out of only one side of their mouths, like the drama masks of the ancients. D’Artagnan therefore kept his dignity and pride intact until he came to the fatal town of Meung.","With such a vade mecum, d’Artagnan turned out to be, morally as well as physically, an exact copy of Cervantes’s hero, to whom we so happily compared him when our duties as historian made it necessary for us to draw his portrait. Don Quixote took windmills for giants and sheep for armies; d’Artagnan took every smile for an insult and every glance for a provocation. As a result of which he kept his fist clenched from Tarbes6 to Meung, and all in all brought his hand to the pommel of his sword ten times a day; however, the fist never landed on any jaw, and the sword never left its scabbard. Not that the sight of the wretched yellow nag did not spread many smiles across the faces of passersby; but since above the nag clanked a sword of respectable size, and above this sword shone an eye more fierce than proud, the passersby restrained their hilarity, or, if hilarity won out over prudence, they tried at least to laugh on one side only, like antique masques.

"10 Cette tragédie, signée de Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin, passait pour avoir été écrite par Richelieu, qui se piquait de littérature. Elle ne fut jouée qu'en 1641. Selon Tallemant des Réaux (Historiettes, « Richelieu », éd. Adam, I, p. 237) et l'abbé Arnauld, les contemporains crurent y voir des allusions à l'idylle entre Anne d'Autriche et Buckingham, notamment dans les deux vers suivants, que prononce l'héroïne : « Je me sens criminelle, aimant un étranger / Qui met, pour mon amour, cet Etat en danger ». Mais la source directe de Dumas est ici l'Essai joint par J.-E Barrière aux Mémoires de Louis-Henri de Brienne.","10 This tragedy, signed by Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin, was said to have been written by Richelieu, who prided himself on literature.

Adam, I, p. 237) and Abbé Arnauld, contemporaries thought they saw allusions to the idyll between Anne of Austria and Buckingham, especially in the following two lines, which the heroine pronounces: ""I feel criminal, loving a foreigner / Who puts, for my love, this State in danger"".

"23 La progéniture : l'ensemble des enfants. Le vrai d'Artagan avait de nombreux frères et soeurs, dont il n'était pas l'aîné.

"« Eh ! mon Dieu, disait d'Artagnan, qui, comme on le sait, ne doutait jamais de rien, il me semble que nous faisons bien de l'embarras pour une chose bien simple : en deux jours, et en crevant deux ou trois chevaux (peu m'importe : j'ai de l'argent), je suis à Béthune, je remets la lettre de la reine à la supérieure, et je ramène le cher trésor que je vais chercher, non pas en Lorraine, non pas en Belgique, mais à Paris, où il sera mieux caché, surtout tant que M. le cardinal sera à La Rochelle. Puis, une fois de retour de la campagne, eh bien ! moitié par la protection de sa cousine, moitié en faveur de ce que nous avons fait personnellement pour elle, nous obtiendrons de la reine ce que nous voudrons. Restez donc ici, ne vous épuisez pas de fatigue inutilement ; moi et Planchet, c'est tout ce qu'il faut pour une expédition aussi simple. »","“Hey! my God, said d'Artagnan, who, as we know, never doubted anything, it seems to me that we make a lot of trouble for a very simple thing: in two days, and by dying two or three horses ( I don't care: I have money), I am in Béthune, I deliver the queen's letter to the superior, and I bring back the dear treasure that I am going to seek, not in Lorraine, not in Belgium , but in Paris, where he will be better hidden, especially as long as the cardinal is at La Rochelle. Then, once back from the campaign, well! half for her cousin's protection, half for what we have personally done for her, we will get what we want from the queen. So stay here, don't wear yourself out unnecessarily; me and Planchet is all it takes for such a simple expedition. »","“Mon Dieu, it seems to me we’re making a big deal out of a simple thing,” said d’Artagnan, the eternal optimist. “In two days, by using up two or three horses—which I can afford to do, as I have plenty of money—I’ll be in Béthune. I present the queen’s letter to the superior, collect the dear treasure I’ve gone for, and head, not to Lorraine or Belgium, but back to Paris. It’ll be much easier to hide her there, especially since the cardinal is at La Rochelle. Then, once we’ve returned to the campaign, we can get what we need to protect her from the queen, relying on the influence of Aramis’s cousin, as well as what we’ve personally done for her. The rest of you might as well stay behind—there’s no point in wearing yourselves out. A simple expedition like this doesn’t call for anyone more than myself and Planchet.”","“Ah, my God,” said d’Artagnan, who, as we know, never suspected anything, “it seems to me that we’re making a lot of fuss over a rather simple thing: in two days, at the risk of foundering two or three horses (I don’t care, I have money), I’m in Béthune , I hand the queen’s letter to the mother superior, and I go off with the dear treasure I’m seeking, not to Lorraine, not to Belgium, but to Paris, where it will be better hidden, above all as long as M. le cardinal is in La Rochelle.

"« Au reste, continua le cardinal en posant la main sur une liasse de papiers, j'ai là tout un dossier qui vous concerne ; mais avant de le lire, j'ai voulu causer avec vous.

"Au reste, ou nous avons mal exposé le caractère de notre chercheur d'aventures, ou notre lecteur a déjà dû remarquer que d'Artagnan n'était point un homme ordinaire. Aussi, tout en se répétant à lui-même que sa mort était inévitable, il ne se résigna point à mourir tout doucettement, comme un autre moins courageux et moins modéré que lui eût fait à sa place. Il réfléchit aux différents caractères de ceux avec lesquels il allait se battre, et commença à voir plus clair dans sa situation. Il espérait, grâce aux excuses loyales qu'il lui réservait, se faire un ami d'Athos, dont l'air grand seigneur et la mine austère lui agréaient fort. Il se flattait de faire peur à Porthos avec l'aventure du baudrier, qu'il pouvait, s'il n'était pas tué sur le coup, raconter à tout le monde, récit qui, poussé adroitement à l'effet, devait couvrir Porthos de ridicule; enfin, quant au sournois Aramis, il n'en avait pas très grand-peur, et en supposant qu'il arrivât jusqu'à lui, il se chargeait de l'expédier bel et bien, ou du moins en le frappant au visage, comme César avait recommandé de faire aux soldats de Pompée, d'endommager à tout jamais cette beauté dont il était si fier 3.","Besides, either we have badly explained the character of our seeker of adventures, or our reader must already have noticed that d'Artagnan was no ordinary man. Also, while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable, he did not resign himself to dying quietly, like someone less courageous and less moderate than he would have done in his place. He pondered the different characters of those he was going to fight with, and began to see his situation more clearly. He hoped, thanks to the loyal excuses which he reserved for him, to make a friend of Athos, whose air of great lord and austere countenance greatly pleased him. He flattered himself that he would frighten Porthos with the adventure of the harness, which he could, if he was not killed instantly, tell everyone, a story which, skilfully put to effect, was to cover Porthos of ridicule; finally, as for the sly Aramis, he was not very much afraid of him, and supposing that he got to him, he undertook to dispatch him well and truly, or at least by striking him in the face, as Caesar had recommended to the soldiers of Pompey, to damage forever this beauty of which he was so proud 3.","It must be clear by this point that d’Artagnan was no ordinary man. Though telling himself his death was inevitable, he refused to accept that death with resignation, as a less courageous man might have done in his place. He reflected on the different characters of his three antagonists and began to see his course more clearly. He hoped, by means of gracious and dignified excuses, to make a friend of Athos, whose air of nobility and whose austere demeanor he admired. He flattered himself he could intimidate Porthos by threatening to reveal the secret of the baldric, which, if he weren’t killed on the spot, he could spread about to everyone. If he told the tale properly Porthos would be a laughingstock. As for sly Aramis, he wasn’t very afraid of him. If he should manage to make it that far, he felt confident he’d make short work of him, or at least mar his face, spoiling the beauty of which he was so proud, as Caesar had recommended be done to the soldiers of Pompey.","Moreover, either we have poorly introduced the character of our adventure seeker, or our reader must already have noticed that he was by no means an ordinary man. And so, while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable, he was not at all resigned to dying meekly, as another man less courageous and less reasonable than he would have been in his place. He hoped, thanks to the honest excuses he had saved up for him, to make a friend of Athos, whose lordly air and austere appearance pleased him greatly. He flattered himself that he might frighten Porthos with the adventure of the baldric, which, if he was not killed at once, he could tell to everyone, a story which, skillfully brought to full effect, should cover Porthos with ridicule. Finally, as for the sly Aramis, he was not much afraid of him, and, supposing that he got to him, he undertook to dispatch him well and good, or at least to strike him on the face, as Caesar recommended doing to Pompey’s soldiers,28 thus spoiling forever that beauty he was so proud of."

"La veille ils s'étaient vus à peine chez le suisse Germain, où d'Artagnan l'avait fait demander. La hâte qu'avait la jeune femme de porter à la reine cette excellente nouvelle de l'heureux retour de son messager fit que les deux amants échangèrent à peine quelques paroles. D'Artagnan suivit donc Mme Bonacieux, mû par un double sentiment, l'amour et la curiosité. Pendant toute la route, et à mesure que les corridors devenaient plus déserts, d'Artagnan voulait arrêter la jeune femme, la saisir, la contempler, ne fût-ce qu'un instant ; mais, vive comme un oiseau, elle glissait toujours entre ses mains, et lorsqu'il voulait parler, son doigt ramené sur sa bouche avec un petit geste impératif plein de charme lui rappelait qu'il était sous l'empire d'une puissance à laquelle il devait aveuglément obéir, et qui lui interdisait jusqu'à la plus légère plainte ; enfin, après une minute ou deux de tours et de détours, Mme Bonacieux ouvrit une porte et introduisit le jeune homme dans un cabinet tout à fait obscur. Là elle lui fit un nouveau signe de mutisme, et ouvrant une seconde porte cachée par une tapisserie dont les ouvertures répandirent tout à coup une vive lumière, elle disparut.","The day before they had hardly seen each other at the Swiss Germain's, where d'Artagnan had sent for him. The young woman's haste to bring the queen this excellent news of her messenger's happy return caused the two lovers to hardly exchange a few words. D'Artagnan therefore followed Madame Bonacieux, moved by a double sentiment, love and curiosity. During the whole journey, and as the corridors became more deserted, d'Artagnan wanted to stop the young woman, seize her, contemplate her, if only for a moment; but, quick as a bird, she always slipped between his hands, and when he wanted to speak, her finger brought back to his mouth with a small imperative gesture full of charm reminded him that he was under the sway of a power to which he had to blindly obey, and which forbade him even the slightest complaint; Finally, after a minute or two of twists and turns, Madame Bonacieux opened a door and ushered the young man into a completely dark cabinet. There she gave him a new sign of silence, and opening a second door hidden by a tapestry, the openings of which suddenly shed a bright light, she disappeared.","They had scarcely seen each other the night before in the apartment of Germain the Swiss, where d’Artagnan had gone to ask for her. She’d been in such a hurry to tell the queen the good news of her messenger’s happy return that they’d barely had time to exchange more than a few words. Now d’Artagnan followed Madame Bonacieux through the crowd, driven by both love and curiosity. He wanted to stop her, take hold of her and look at her, if only for a moment, all the more so as the corridors they traversed became more deserted—but, quick as a bird, she always glided out from between his hands. When he started to speak, she placed her finger on her mouth in a charming but imperative little gesture that reminded him that he was under the command of another, a power that he must blindly obey, without comment or complaint. At last, after a series of turns and detours, Madame Bonacieux opened a door and led the young man into a lightless closet. She repeated the sign for silence. Then she opened slightly a second door hidden behind a tapestry, and a sliver of bright light streamed into the closet. She touched him lightly on the cheek and disappeared back through the door to the corridor.","They had barely seen each other the evening before at Germain’s, where d’Artagnan had asked for her. The hurry the young woman had been in to bring the queen this excellent news of the fortunate return of her messenger had made it so that the two lovers barely exchanged a few words. D’Artagnan thus followed Mme Bonacieux, stirred by two feelings, love and curiosity. All along the way, and as the corridors became more and more deserted, d’Artagnan wanted to stop the young woman, hold her, look at her, if only for an instant; but, quick as a bird, she always slipped from his hands, and when he wanted to speak, her finger brought to her lips with a charmingly imperative little gesture reminded him that he was under the sway of a power that he had to obey blindly, and that forbade him even the slightest complaint. Finally, after a minute or two of twists and turns, Mme Bonacieux opened a door and ushered the young man into a completely dark dressing room. There she again made him a sign to keep mum, and opening a second door hidden behind a tapestry, the gaps of which suddenly let in a bright light, she disappeared."

"Mais là, comme il descendait de cheval à la porte du Franc Meunier sans que personne, hôte, garçon ou palefrenier, fût venu prendre l'étrier au montoir 28, d'Artagnan avisa à une fenêtre entrouverte du rez-de-chaussée un gentilhomme de belle taille et de haute mine, quoique au visage légèrement renfrogné, lequel causait avec deux personnes qui paraissaient l'écouter avec déférence. D'Artagnan crut tout naturellement, selon son habitude, être l'objet de la conversation et écouta. Cette fois, d'Artagnan ne s'était trompé qu'à moitié : ce n'était pas de lui qu'il était question, mais de son cheval. Le gentilhomme paraissait énumérer à ses auditeurs toutes ses qualités, et comme, ainsi que je l'ai dit, les auditeurs paraissaient avoir une grande déférence pour le narrateur, ils éclataient de rire à tout moment. Or, comme un demi-sourire suffisait pour éveiller l'irascibilité 29du jeune homme, on comprend quel effet produisit sur lui tant de bruyante hilarité.","But there, as he was dismounting at the Porte du Franc Meunier without anyone, host, waiter or groom, coming to take the stirrup at mount 28, d'Artagnan beheld at a half-open window on the ground floor a gentleman of good size and tall appearance, although with a slightly frowning face, he was chatting with two people who seemed to listen to him with deference. D'Artagnan naturally believed, as usual, to be the subject of the conversation and listened. This time d'Artagnan was only half mistaken: it was not about him that was in question, but about his horse. The gentleman seemed to enumerate to his listeners all his qualities, and as, as I have said, the listeners seemed to have a great deference for the narrator, they burst out laughing all the time. Now, as a half-smile sufficed to arouse the young man's irascibility, we understand what effect such noisy hilarity had on him.","There, as he was dismounting from his horse at the gate of the Jolly Miller, without host, hostler, or groom coming to hold his stirrup, d’Artagnan saw a gentleman at an open window of the ground floor.

As was his way, d’Artagnan naturally assumed that he was the subject of their conversation and listened. This time d’Artagnan was half right: it wasn’t him they spoke of, but his horse. The gentleman seemed to be listing its qualities for his audience, who flattered him by laughing at every remark. Given that a half-smile was enough to rile d’Artagnan, one can imagine what effect this outright hilarity had on him.","But there, as he was getting off his horse at the gate of the Jolly Miller, without anyone, host, waiter, or groom, coming to hold his stirrup at the mounting block, d’Artagnan caught sight, through a half-open window on the ground floor, of a gentleman of fine proportion and haughty bearing, though with a somewhat sullen look, talking with two persons who appeared to be listening to him with deference. D’Artagnan quite naturally believed, according to his habit, that he was the subject of conversation, and he listened in. This time d’Artagnan was only half mistaken: it was a question not of him, but of his horse.

"Quoiqu'il se sentît vigoureusement appuyé, le jeune homme n'était pas sans inquiétude en montant pas à pas le grand escalier.

"Aussi Louis XIII avait-il un attachement réel pour Tréville, attachement royal, attachement égoïste, c'est vrai, mais qui n'en était pas moins un attachement. C'est que, dans ces temps malheureux, on cherchait fort à s'entourer d'hommes de la trempe de Tréville. Beaucoup pouvaient prendre pour devise l'épithète de fort, qui faisait la seconde partie de son exergue9; mais peu de gentilshommes pouvaient réclamer l'épithète de fidèle, qui en formait la première. Tréville était un de ces derniers ; c'était une de ces rares organisations 10, à l'intelligence obéissante comme celle du dogue, à la valeur aveugle, à l'œil rapide, à la main prompte, à qui l'œil n'avait été donné que pour voir si le roi était mécontent de quelqu'un, et la main que pour frapper ce déplaisant quelqu'un, un Besme, un Maurevers, un Poltrot de Méré, un Vitry 11. Enfin, à Tréville, il n'avait manqué jusque-là que l'occasion ; mais il la guettait, et il se promettait bien de la saisir par ses trois cheveux 12si jamais elle passait à la portée de sa main. Aussi Louis XIII fit-il de Tréville le capitaine de ses mousquetaires, lesquels étaient à Louis XIII, pour le dévouement ou plutôt pour le fanatisme, ce que ses ordinaires13étaient à Henri III et ce que sa garde écossaise était à Louis XI.","So Louis XIII had a real attachment to Treville, a royal attachment, a selfish attachment, it is true, but which was nonetheless an attachment. It was because, in those unhappy times, people tried very hard to surround themselves with men of Tréville's caliber. Many could take as motto the epithet fort, which formed the second part of its exergue9; but few gentlemen could claim the epithet of faithful, which formed the first. Treville was one of the latter; it was one of those rare organizations,10 with an obedient intelligence like that of the mastiff, with blind valor, with a quick eye, with a quick hand, to which the eye had been given only to see if the king was displeased with someone, and the hand only to strike this unpleasant someone, a Besme, a Maurevers, a Poltrot de Méré, a Vitry 11. Finally, at Tréville, he had hitherto lacked only the occasion; but he was watching her, and he promised himself to seize her by her three hairs if she ever passed within reach of his hand. So Louis XIII made Treville the captain of his musketeers, who were to Louis XIII, for devotion or rather for fanaticism, what his ordinary13 were to Henry III and what his Scottish guard was to Louis XI.","So Louis XIII had a real affection for Tréville—a royal, egotistical affection, it’s true, but an affection nonetheless. In those unhappy times a king needed to surround himself with men of Tréville’s mettle. Many might lay claim to the term “strong,” the second part of his motto, but few gentlemen deserved to be called “loyal.” Tréville was one of those rare spirits who possessed the blind courage and intelligent obedience of a faithful watchdog. He had a quick eye that saw if the king was displeased with someone, and a hand that instantly struck the offender; he was, in other words, a Besme, a Maurevers, a Poltrot de Méré, or a Vitry.14 In short, Tréville needed nothing but a chance; and he was vigilant, always ready to seize opportunity by the short hairs whenever it came within reach. Thus Louis XIII had made him his Captain of Musketeers, who were to the king in their devotion—or rather their fanaticism— what his Ordinaries had been to Henri III and his Scots Guard to Louis XI.","And so Louis XIII had a real affection for Tréville—a royal affection, an egoistic affection, true, but an affection nonetheless. The fact is that, in those unfortunate times, one tried hard to surround oneself with men of Tréville’s temper. Many could take as their motto the epithet “strong,” which was the second part of his epigraph, but few gentlemen could lay claim to the epithet “faithful,” which formed the first part. Tréville was one of the latter; he was one of those rare organizations, of an obedient intelligence like that of a mastiff, of blind valor, of quick eye, of prompt hand, who had been given eyes only in order to see if the king was displeased with someone, a Besme, a Maurevers, a Poltrot de Méré, a Vitry.12 Finally, all Tréville had lacked till then was the occasion; but he watched out for it, and firmly promised himself to seize it by its three hairs if it ever came within reach of his hand. And so Louis XIII made Tréville captain of his musketeers, who in their devotion, or rather fanaticism, were for Louis XIII what his regulars were for Henri III and what his Scots Guard was for Louis XI."
"Aramis, cette fois, ne se fâcha point, mais il prit son air le plus modeste et répondit affectueusement : « Mon cher, n'oubliez pas que je veux être d' Église, et que je fuis toutes les occasions mondaines.

He assumed a modest air and said, “Mon cher, don’t forget that I intend to join the Church, and thus abstain from all such worldly complications. That handkerchief wasn’t mine, it had merely been forgotten at my house by one of my friends. I had to recover it to prevent him, and the lady he loves, from being compromised. As for me, I have no mistress, nor do I want one. In that regard I follow the very judicious example of Athos.”","This time Aramis did not become angry, but put on his most modest air and replied affectionately: “My dear, don’t forget that I wish to be in the Church, and I flee all worldly circumstances.

"26 Partenaire. Ce mot, emprunté à l'anglais au XVIIIe siècle, avait conservé à l'époque de Dumas la graphie partner.

This word, borrowed from English in the 18th century, had retained the spelling partner at the time of Dumas. But it originally came from Old French parçonier (partner), itself derived from the Latin partitio (sharing).","Nine days after leaving the Charente, Milady, pale with rage and frustration, saw they had made it no farther than the blue coast of Finisterre.","that, at the risk of terrible consequences for herself, she had begged the captain to put her ashore; but the captain, anxious to escape his false position, placed between French and English cruisers like a bat between the rats and the birds, was in great haste to return to England, and stubbornly refused to obey what he took to be a feminine caprice, promising his passenger, who, moreover, had been especially recommended to him by the cardinal, to put her off, if the sea and the French permitted, at one of the ports of Brittany, either Lorient or Brest; but meanwhile the wind was contrary, the sea was rough, they tacked about and ran to windward."

"Chose étrange et qui fit frissonner d'Artagnan de la plante des pieds à la racine des cheveux, cette douce lumière, cette calme lampe éclairait une scène de désordre épouvantable ; une des vitres de la fenêtre était cassée, la porte de la chambre avait été enfoncée et, à demi brisée, pendait à ses gonds ; une table qui avait dû être couverte d'un élégant souper gisait à terre ; les flacons en éclats, les fruits écrasés jonchaient le parquet ; tout témoignait dans cette chambre d'une lutte violente et désespérée ; d'Artagnan crut même reconnaître au milieu de ce pêle-mêle étrange des lambeaux de vêtements et quelques taches sanglantes maculant la nappe et les rideaux.","Strangely enough, and which made d'Artagnan shiver from the soles of his feet to the roots of his hair, this soft light, this calm lamp lit up a scene of terrible disorder; one of the panes of the window was broken, the bedroom door had been broken in and, half broken, was hanging from its hinges; a table that must have been covered with an elegant supper lay on the ground; shattered bottles, crushed fruit were strewn on the floor; everything in this room testified to a violent and desperate struggle; d'Artagnan even thought he recognized in the midst of this strange pell-mell shreds of clothing and a few bloody stains staining the tablecloth and the curtains.","The calm, unwavering glow of the lamp with its soft light illuminated a scene of unspeakable chaos, and the strange contrast sent a chill through d’Artagnan from his soles to his scalp.

"Les deux mousquetaires étaient déjà arrivés et pelotaient 14ensemble. Athos, qui était très fort à tous les exercices du corps, passa avec d'Artagnan du côté opposé, et leur fit défi. Mais au premier mouvement qu'il essaya, quoiqu'il jouât de la main gauche, il comprit que sa blessure était encore trop récente pour lui permettre un pareil exercice. D'Artagnan resta donc seul, et comme il déclara qu'il était trop maladroit pour soutenir une partie en règle, on continua seulement à s'envoyer des balles sans compter le jeu. Mais une de ces balles, lancée par le poignet herculéen de Porthos, passa si près du visage de d'Artagnan, qu'il pensa que si, au lieu de passer à côté, elle eût donné dedans, son audience était probablement perdue, attendu qu'il lui eût été de toute impossibilité de se présenter chez le roi. Or, comme de cette audience, dans son imagination gasconne, dépendait tout son avenir, il salua poliment Porthos et Aramis, déclarant qu'il ne reprendrait la partie que lorsqu'il serait en état de leur tenir tête, et il s'en revint prendre place près de la corde et dans la galerie15.","The two musketeers had already arrived and were groping together. Athos, who was very good at all the exercises of the body, passed with d'Artagnan to the opposite side, and defied them. But at the first movement he tried, although he played with his left hand, he understood that his injury was still too recent to allow him such an exercise. D'Artagnan therefore remained alone, and as he declared that he was too clumsy to support a regular game, we only continued to send balls without counting the game. But one of these balls, launched by the Herculean wrist of Porthos, passed so close to the face of d'Artagnan, that he thought that if, instead of passing by, she had given in, his audience would probably have been lost, since it would have been absolutely impossible for him to present himself. at the king's. Now, as on this audience, in his Gascon imagination, his whole future depended, he politely saluted Porthos and Aramis, declaring that he would not resume the game until he was in a condition to stand up to them, and he returned. take place near the rope and in the gallery15.","The two other musketeers were already at the courts, knocking the balls about. Athos, who excelled at all sports, led d’Artagnan onto the court and challenged them. However, though he tried to play left-handed, with the first swing he discovered his wound was still too recent to allow such strenuous exercise. D’Artagnan kept at it, but he was too much of a novice to play a regular game, so they only volleyed balls back and forth without keeping score. One of these balls, served from Porthos’s herculean wrist, passed so close to d’Artagnan’s face that he thought, if he’d been struck by it, it probably would have cost him his royal audience. He couldn’t possibly be presented to the king with a swollen face, and in the Gascon’s imagination his entire future depended on this audience. So he saluted Porthos and Aramis politely and bowed out of further play, offering to resume the game when he could meet them on more equal terms. He left the court and found a place in the gallery overlooking the net.","The two musketeers had already arrived and were batting the ball around. Athos, who was very good at all physical exercises, went with d’Artagnan to the other side and challenged them. But with the first movement he made, though he was playing with his left hand, he understood that his wound was still too recent to allow him such exercise. D’Artagnan thus remained alone, and as he declared that he was too clumsy to keep up a regulation game, they simply went on hitting balls back and forth without counting points. But one of these balls, sped by the herculean fist of Porthos, came so close to d’Artagnan’s face that he thought if, instead of passing by, it had gone right into it, his audience would probably have been ruined, seeing that it would have been quite impossible for him to present himself to the king. Now, since his whole future, in his Gascon imagination, depended on that audience, he politely saluted Porthos and Aramis, declaring that he would not take up the game again until he could hold his own, and went to take a seat in the gallery close to the rope."

"— Cet Espagnol avait à son service un laquais qui l'avait accompagné dans son voyage au Mexique. Ce laquais était mon compatriote, de sorte que nous nous liâmes d'autant plus rapidement qu'il y avait entre nous de grands rapports de caractère. Nous aimions tous deux la chasse par-dessus tout, de sorte qu'il me racontait comment, dans les plaines de pampas 30, les naturels du pays chassent le tigre et les taureaux avec de simples nœuds coulants qu'ils jettent au cou de ces terribles animaux. D'abord, je ne voulais pas croire qu'on pût en arriver à ce degré d'adresse, de jeter à vingt ou trente pas l'extrémité d'une corde où l'on veut ; mais devant la preuve il fallait bien reconnaître la vérité du récit. Mon ami plaçait une bouteille à trente pas, et à chaque coup il lui prenait le goulot dans un nœud coulant. Je me livrai à cet exercice, et comme la nature m'a doué de quelques facultés, aujourd'hui je jette le lasso aussi bien qu'aucun homme du monde. Eh bien ! comprenez-vous ? Notre hôte a une cave très bien garnie, mais dont la clef ne le quitte pas ; seulement, cette cave a un soupirail. Or, par ce soupirail, je jette le lasso ; et comme je sais maintenant où est le bon coin, j'y puisé.

This lackey was my compatriot, so that we bonded all the more quickly because there were great character ties between us. We both loved hunting above all else, so he used to tell me how in the pampas plains 30 the natives of the country hunt tigers and bulls with simple nooses which they throw around the necks of these terrible animals. First of all, I didn't want to believe that one could arrive at this degree of skill, of throwing the end of a rope twenty or thirty paces where one wants; but before the proof it was necessary to recognize the truth of the story. My friend placed a bottle thirty paces away, and each time he took its neck in a noose. I gave myself up to this exercise, and as nature has endowed me with some faculties, today I throw the lasso as well as any man in the world. Well ! do you understand ? Our host has a very well stocked cellar, but the key of which does not leave him; only, this cellar has a ventilator. Now, through this ventilator, I throw the lasso; and as I now know where the good corner is, I drew from it. Here, sir, is how the New World happens to relate to the bottles that are on this chest of drawers and on this secretary. Now, would you like to taste our wine, and, without prejudice, you will tell us what you think.","“This Spaniard had in his service a lackey who’d accompanied him on his voyage to Mexico. This lackey was from my home province and we quickly became friends, especially since we had similar tastes and enjoyed hunting more than anything. He told me how, on the plains of the Pampas, the natives hunt tigers and wild bulls with simple running nooses, which they loop around the necks of these dangerous animals. At first I couldn’t believe that anyone could be so skillful as to throw a cord twenty or thirty paces with any accuracy, but faced with proof I had to acknowledge it was true. Aiming for a bottle thirty paces away, my friend could catch the bottle’s neck in his noose every time. I started practicing, and since I have a little natural talent for this sort of thing, today I can throw my ‘lasso’ as well as any man in the world. “So, do you see it yet? Our host has a well-furnished wine cellar, but it’s locked, and the key never leaves him. However, this cellar has a small window for ventilation. I toss my lasso through the ventilator, and as I now know in which corner he keeps his best, I amuse myself by fishing for vintage.

Now, will you have a taste of our wine and give us your honest opinion of it?”","“This Spaniard had a lackey in his service who had accompanied him on his voyage to Mexico.

"Tout le long de la route, le duc se fit mettre au courant par d'Artagnan non pas de tout ce qui s'était passé, mais de ce que d'Artagnan savait. En rapprochant ce qu'il avait entendu sortir de la bouche du jeune homme de ses souvenirs à lui, il put donc se faire une idée assez exacte d'une position de la gravité de laquelle, au reste, la lettre de la reine, si courte et si peu explicite qu'elle fût, lui donnait la mesure. Mais ce qui l'étonnait surtout, c'est que le cardinal, intéressé comme il l'était à ce que le jeune homme ne mît pas le pied en Angleterre, ne fût point parvenu à l'arrêter en route. Ce fut alors, et sur la manifestation de cet étonnement, que d'Artagnan lui raconta les précautions prises, et comment, grâce au dévouement de ses trois amis qu'il avait éparpillés tout sanglants sur la route, il était arrivé à en être quitte pour le coup d'épée qui avait traversé le billet de la reine, et qu'il avait rendu à M. de Wardes en si terrible monnaie. Tout en écoutant ce récit, fait avec la plus grande simplicité, le duc regardait de temps en temps le jeune homme d'un air étonné, comme s'il n'eût pas pu comprendre que tant de prudence, de courage et de dévouement s'alliât avec un visage qui n'indiquait pas encore vingt ans.","All along the way, the duke made himself informed by d'Artagnan not of all that had happened, but of what d'Artagnan knew. By comparing what he had heard coming from the mouth of the young man with his own memories, he was therefore able to form a fairly exact idea of a position of the gravity of which, moreover, the queen's letter, if short and however inexplicit it was, gave him the measure. But what astonished him above all was that the cardinal, concerned as he was that the young man should not set foot in England, had not succeeded in stopping him on the way. It was then, and on the manifestation of this astonishment, that d'Artagnan told him of the precautions taken, and how, thanks to the devotion of his three friends whom he had scattered all bloody on the road, he had come to be free of it. for the thrust which had passed through the queen's note, and which he had returned to M. de Wardes in such terrible coin. While listening to this story, told with the greatest simplicity, the duke looked from time to time at the young man with an air of astonishment, as if he could not understand that so much prudence, courage and devotion were went with a face that did not yet indicate twenty years.","As they galloped toward London, the duke fired questions at d’Artagnan to try to get a clearer picture of the queen’s situation. He asked d’Artagnan to tell him only what he knew, not what he thought might have happened. Combining what he heard from the young man with his own information, he was able to form a pretty fair idea of the position, the seriousness of which had been conveyed by the queen’s letter, so short but so explicit. What astonished him the most was that the cardinal, who had so much at stake in making sure that d’Artagnan never set foot in England, had nonetheless failed to stop him en route. When the duke remarked on this, d’Artagnan told him of the precautions they’d taken, and how, thanks to the devotion of his three friends, now left scattered and bloody on the road , he’d arrived having suffered no more than the single sword-thrust that had pierced the queen’s letter (and for which he’d repaid de Wardes in such terrible coin). D’Artagnan told his story simply and modestly, while the duke listened in astonishment, as if unable to believe that so much prudence, courage, and devotion could be wrapped up in a person apparently no more than twenty years old.","On the way there, the duke informed himself through d’Artagnan, not about all that had happened, but about what d’Artagnan knew. By comparing what he heard from the young man’s lips with his own memories, he was able to form a fairly accurate idea of a situation the gravity of which, moreover, the queen’s letter, short and inexplicit as it was, gave him the measure. But what surprised him most of all was that the cardinal, interested as he was in keeping the young man from setting foot in England, had not managed to stop him on the way. It was then, and on the showing of this surprise, that d’Artagnan told him of the precautions taken, and how, thanks to the devotion of his three friends, whom he had scattered all bleeding along the roadside, he had managed to get off with the sword stroke that had pierced the queen’s letter, and which he had paid back to M. de Wardes in such terrible coin. While listening to this account, which was made in the greatest simplicity, the duke looked at the young man from time to time with an astonished air, as if he could not understand how so much prudence, courage, and devotion could combine with a face that indicated something less than twenty years of age."

"D'Artagnan, tout en marchant et en monologuant, était arrivé à quelques pas de l'hôtel d'Aiguillon 6, et devant cet hôtel il avait aperçu Aramis causant gaiement avec trois gentilshommes des gardes du roi. De son côté, Aramis aperçut d'Artagnan; mais comme il n'oubliait point que c'était devant ce jeune homme que M. de Tréville s'était si fort emporté le matin, et qu'un témoin des reproches que les mousquetaires avaient reçus ne lui était d'aucune façon agréable, il fit semblant de ne pas le voir. D'Artagnan, tout entier au contraire à ses plans de conciliation et de courtoisie, s'approcha des quatre jeunes gens en leur faisant un grand salut accompagné du plus gracieux sourire. Aramis inclina légèrement la tête, mais ne sourit point. Tous quatre, au reste, interrompirent à l'instant même leur conversation.","D'Artagnan, while walking and soliloquizing, had come within a few steps of the Hotel d'Aiguillon,6 and in front of this hotel he had seen Aramis chatting gaily with three gentlemen of the King's Guards. On his side, Aramis perceived d'Artagnan; but as he did not forget that it was in front of this young man that M. de Tréville had become so angry that morning, and that a witness to the reproaches which the musketeers had received was in no way agreeable to him, he pretended not to see him. D'Artagnan, on the contrary entirely devoted to his plans of conciliation and courtesy, approached the four young people, making them a grand salute accompanied by the most gracious smile. Aramis bowed his head slightly, but did not smile. All four, moreover, immediately interrupted their conversation.","D’Artagnan, as he walked and talked with himself, had arrived within a few paces of the hôtel of Madame de Combalet, and in front of that mansion he saw Aramis in conversation with three gentlemen of the French Guards.

D’Artagnan, on the contrary, full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy, approached the four men and gave them a deep bow, smiling hopefully. All conversation immediately stopped. Aramis nodded his head slightly but didn’t smile. D’Artagnan was not so naïve as to fail to see he was intruding, but he was also too ignorant of the manners of the beau monde to know how to gracefully withdraw from a false position, which is where a man usually finds himself when he interrupts a conversation that doesn’t concern him.","D’Artagnan, while walking along and soliloquizing, had come within a few steps of the hôtel d’Aiguillon,26 and in front of this hôtel he caught sight of Aramis talking gaily with three gentlemen of the king’s guards.

D’Artagnan was not so foolish as to fail to perceive that he was one too many; but he was not yet so broken to the ways of society as to gallantly get himself out of such a false situation as is generally that of a man who comes to mix with people he hardly knows and in a conversation that does not concern him."

Or il se promenait habituellement, son escopette 27sur l'épaule, derrière les haies qui bordent les chemins, et quand il voyait venir un catholique seul, la religion protestante l'emportait aussitôt dans son esprit. Il abaissait son escopette dans la direction du voyageur ; puis, lorsqu'il était à dix pas de lui, il entamait un dialogue qui finissait presque toujours par l'abandon que le voyageur faisait de sa bourse pour sauver sa vie. Il va sans dire que lorsqu'il voyait venir un huguenot, il se sentait pris d'un zèle catholique si ardent, qu'il ne comprenait pas comment, un quart d'heure auparavant, il avait pu avoir des doutes sur la supériorité de notre sainte religion. Car, moi, Monsieur, je suis catholique, mon père, fidèle à ses principes, ayant fait mon frère aîné huguenot.","— As it was at the time of the wars between the Catholics and the Huguenots, and he saw the Catholics exterminating the Huguenots, and the Huguenots exterminating the Catholics, all in the name of religion, he had formed a mixed belief, which allowed him to be sometimes Catholic, sometimes Huguenot. Now he usually walked, his escopette slung over his shoulder, behind the hedges that line the paths, and when he saw a Catholic coming alone, the Protestant religion immediately prevailed in his mind. He lowered his scope in the direction of the traveller; then, when he was ten paces from him, he began a dialogue which almost always ended in the traveler giving up his purse to save his life. It goes without saying that when he saw a Huguenot coming, he felt seized with such ardent Catholic zeal that he did not understand how, a quarter of an hour earlier, he could have had doubts about the superiority of our holy religion. For me, Monsieur, I am a Catholic, my father, faithful to his principles, having made my elder brother a Huguenot.","“It was during the wars between the Catholics and Huguenots.

"D'ailleurs, il vint au jeune homme cette idée, qu'en restant aux environs du lieu où l'événement s'était passé, il obtiendrait peut-être quelque éclaircissement sur cette mystérieuse affaire. Au sixième cabaret, comme nous l'avons dit, d'Artagnan s'arrêta donc, demanda une bouteille de vin de première qualité, s'accouda dans l'angle le plus obscur et se décida à attendre ainsi le jour ; mais cette fois encore son espérance fut trompée, et quoiqu'il écoutât de toutes ses oreilles, il n'entendit, au milieu des jurons, des lazzi 7et des injures qu'échangeaient entre eux les ouvriers, les laquais et les rouliers 8qui composaient l'honorable société dont il faisait partie, rien qui pût le mettre sur la trace de la pauvre femme enlevée. Force lui fut donc, après avoir avalé sa bouteille par désœuvrement et pour ne pas éveiller des soupçons, de chercher dans son coin la posture la plus satisfaisante possible et de s'endormir tant bien que mal. D'Artagnan avait vingt ans, on se le rappelle, et à cet âge le sommeil a des droits imprescriptibles qu'il réclame impérieusement, même sur les cœurs les plus désespérés.","Besides, the young man had the idea that by staying near the place where the event had taken place, he might perhaps obtain some clarification on this mysterious affair. At the sixth cabaret, as we have said, d'Artagnan therefore stopped, asked for a bottle of wine of the first quality, leaned on his elbow in the darkest corner, and decided to wait thus for daylight; but this time again his hope was deceived, and although he listened with all his ears, he did not hear, in the midst of the oaths, the lazzi 7 and the insults exchanged among themselves by the workmen, the lackeys and the carters 8 who composed the honorable society of which he was a part, nothing that could put him on the trail of the poor kidnapped woman. So he was forced, after having swallowed his bottle out of idleness and so as not to arouse suspicion, to seek in his corner the most satisfactory posture possible and to fall asleep as best he could. D'Artagnan was twenty years old, it will be remembered, and at that age sleep has inalienable rights which it demands imperiously, even over the most desperate hearts.","Besides, it occurred to d’Artagnan that if he remained in the neighborhood of the crime something might yet occur that would shed some light on the mysterious affair. So d’Artagnan stopped in the sixth cabaret, asked for a bottle of their best wine, then installed himself in the darkest corner of the room and settled in to wait for daylight. Once again his hopes came to naught, for though he listened to the cabaret’s clientele with both ears , he heard nothing but crude insults and coarse jokes from the laborers, servants, and drovers who composed the honorable society of which he was temporarily a part. There was nothing at all about his poor abducted lady. Lacking options, he availed himself of his bottle until it was empty, and then to avoid suspicion he curled up to try to sleep as best he could. Of course, he was only twenty years old, an age when sleep has inalienable rights that must be obeyed, even over hearts in despair.","Besides, the idea occurred to the young man that by remaining in the neighborhood of the place where the abduction had occurred, he might obtain some elucidation of this mysterious affair. At the sixth tavern, as we have said, d’Artagnan thus stopped, ordered a bottle of first-class wine, leaned on his elbows in the darkest corner, and decided to wait like that till daybreak. But this time, too, his hopes were deceived, and though he listened with all his ears, he heard, amidst the oaths, gibes, and curses exchanged by the workers, lackeys, and wagoners who made up the honorable society he now shared, nothing that could put him on the trail of the poor abducted woman. He had no choice then, after downing his bottle out of idleness and so as not to arouse suspicion, but to try to find the most satisfactory position possible in his corner and sleep as well as he could. D’Artagnan was twenty, it will be recalled, and at that age sleep has inalienable rights, which it imperiously lays claim to, even over the most desperate hearts."

For him, there was no doubt that she was the victim of the Cardinal's vengeance, and, as we know, His Eminence's vengeance was terrible.

For himself, he had no doubt but that she was the victim of the cardinal’s vengeance—and as everyone said, the vengeance of His Eminence was terrible. He couldn’t understand how he himself had managed to find favor in that minister’s eyes. No doubt that’s what Monsieur de Cavois would have revealed to him, if the Captain of the Cardinal’s Guards had found him at home.","However, all along his way, a deep sadness gripped his heart: he thought of the young and pretty Mme Bonacieux, who was to have given him the reward for his devotion.

Elle songea que sans aucun doute le cardinal serait furieux de son retour, et que par conséquent il serait plus disposé à écouter les plaintes qu'on porterait contre elle que les accusations qu'elle porterait contre les autres. Elle laissa donc passer Lorient et Brest sans insister près du capitaine, qui, de son côté, se garda bien de lui donner l'éveil. Milady continua donc sa route, et le jour même où Planchet s'embarquait de Portsmouth pour la France, la messagère de Son Eminence entrait triomphante dans le port.","She calculated that to cross this corner of France and return to the Cardinal, she would need at least three days; add a day for landing and that was four; add these four days to the nine others, it was thirteen days wasted, thirteen days during which so many important events could take place in London.

So she let Lorient and Brest pass without insisting on being put ashore—and the captain, for his part, was careful not to remind her of her earlier demand. Milady’s ship stayed on course, and the ambassador of His Eminence arrived triumphantly at Portsmouth on the very day that Planchet took ship from that same port to return to France.","She calculated that to cross that corner of France and return to the cardinal would take her at least three days; add one day for the landing and it made four; add those four days to the nine others, that was thirteen days lost, thirteen days during which many important events could take place in London.

Comme il allait passer, le vent s'engouffra dans le long manteau de Porthos, et d'Artagnan vint donner droit dans le manteau. Sans doute, Porthos avait des raisons de ne pas abandonner cette partie essentielle de son vêtement, car, au lieu de laisser aller le pan qu'il tenait, il tira à lui, de sorte que d'Artagnan s'enroula dans le velours par un mouvement de rotation qu'explique la résistance de l'obstiné Porthos.","But, at the street door, Porthos was talking with a soldier on guard.

Doubtless Porthos had reasons for not abandoning this essential part of his garment, for, instead of letting go of the tail which he was holding, he tugged at him, so that d'Artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet. a rotational movement explained by the resistance of the obstinate Porthos.","But at the courtyard gate Porthos was talking with the soldier on guard. Between them there was just enough space for a man to pass; d’Artagnan thought he could make it and sprang forward to dart between them. But he hadn’t taken the wind into account. As he passed, the wind blew out Porthos’s long cloak, and d’Artagnan ran full into it. Porthos must have had powerful reasons for retaining his cloak, for instead of letting it go, he pulled it toward him, so stubbornly that d’Artagnan was rolled up in the velvet.","But at the street door Porthos was talking with a soldier of the guards.
