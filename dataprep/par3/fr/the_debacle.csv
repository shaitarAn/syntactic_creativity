"Rochas voulut le faire taire. Brutalement, il allait lui dire qu’avec une blessure pareille, on ne dérangeait pas inutilement deux camarades. Puis, apitoyé :","Rochas wanted to silence him. Brutally, he was going to tell him that with such an injury, one was not unnecessarily disturbing two comrades. Then, pitied:","Rochas wanted to shut him up, and was on the point of telling him brutally that with a wound like that there was no point in upsetting all his comrades. But then he was touched:","Rochas endeavored to silence him, and it was on his brutal lips to say that it was useless to imperil two comrades' lives for one whose wound was so evidently mortal, when his better nature made its influence felt and he murmured:"
"Alors, en quelques minutes, aidée de Silvine et de Prosper, Henriette organisa la chambre, y fit porter Jean, que l’on coucha dans un lit tout frais, sans qu’il donnât d’autres signes de vie que des balbutiements vagues. Il ouvrait les yeux, regardait, ne semblait voir personne. Maurice achevait de boire un verre de vin et de manger un reste de viande, tout d’un coup anéanti, dans la détente de sa fatigue, lorsque le docteur Dalichamp arriva, comme tous les matins, pour sa visite à l’ambulance ; et le jeune homme trouva encore la force de le suivre, avec sa sœur, au chevet du blessé, anxieux de savoir.","So, in a few minutes, with the help of Silvine and Prosper, Henriette organized the room, had Jean carried there, and put him in a fresh bed, without his giving any other sign of life than a vague stammering. He opened his eyes, looked, seemed to see no one. Maurice was finishing a glass of wine and eating some leftover meat, suddenly exhausted, in the relaxation of his fatigue, when Doctor Dalichamp arrived, as he does every morning, for his visit to the ambulance; and the young man still found the strength to follow him, with his sister, to the wounded man's bedside, anxious to know.","Then, with the help of Silvine and Prosper, Henriette only took a few minutes to rearrange her room and have Jean carried there, where he was put into a clean bed, but still he gave no sign of life beyond a few vague mutterings. He opened his eyes and looked round but did not appear to see anybody. Maurice was just finishing a glass of wine and a bit of meat and was suddenly overcome with fatigue, when Dr Dalichamp came, as he did every morning on his way to the hospital, and Maurice did just find the strength to go with him and his sister to the wounded man’s bedside, in his anxiety to find out.","It took Henriette but a few minutes, with the assistance of Silvine and Prosper, to put the room in order; then she had Jean brought in and they laid him on a cool, clean bed, he giving no sign of life during the operation save to mutter some unintelligible words. He opened his eyes and looked about him, but seemed not to be conscious of anyone's presence in the room. Maurice, who was just beginning to be aware how utterly prostrated he was by his fatigue, was drinking a glass of wine and eating a bit of cold meat, left over from the yesterday's dinner, when Doctor Dalichamp came in, as was his daily custom previous to visiting the hospital, and the young man, in his anxiety for his friend, mustered up his strength to follow him, together with his sister, to the bedside of the patient."
"Tout de suite, devant la porte charretière d’une ferme, ils entendirent des jurons, ils aperçurent un général qui se fâchait, monté sur un cheval fumant de sueur. C’était le général Bourgain-Desfeuilles, le chef de leur brigade, couvert lui-même de poussière et l’air brisé de fatigue. Sa grosse figure colorée de bon vivant exprimait l’exaspération où le jetait le désastre, qu’il regardait comme une malchance personnelle. Depuis le matin, ses soldats ne l’avaient plus revu. Sans doute il s’était égaré sur le champ de bataille, courant après les débris de sa brigade, très capable de se faire tuer, dans sa colère contre ces batteries prussiennes qui balayaient l’Empire et sa fortune d’officier aimé des Tuileries.","Immediately, in front of the cart gate of a farm, they heard swearing, they saw a general who was getting angry, mounted on a horse smoking with sweat. It was General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, the leader of their brigade, himself covered in dust and looking broken with fatigue. His big face, colored like a bon vivant, expressed the exasperation into which the disaster had thrown him, which he regarded as personal misfortune. Since the morning his soldiers had not seen him again. No doubt he had lost his way on the battlefield, running after the remains of his brigade, very capable of being killed, in his anger against these Prussian batteries which were sweeping the Empire and his fortune as a beloved officer of the Tuileries.","Then they suddenly heard somebody cursing and swearing in front of the gateway to a farmyard, and they saw a furious general on a steaming horse. It was General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, the commander of their brigade, also covered in dust and looking dog-tired. His big red face, the face of a man who does himself well, expressed the state of exasperation he was thrown into by the disaster, which he took as a personal misfortune. The soldiers had not set eyes on him since early that morning. Presumably he had got himself lost on the battlefield, running about after the scattered remains of his brigade, and quite capable of letting himself be killed in his anger with the Prussian batteries for sweeping away the Empire and his prospects as an officer well thought of at the Tuileries.","The first object they set eyes on was an officer who had reined in his smoking, steaming charger before a farm-yard gate and was venting his towering rage in a volley of Billingsgate. It was General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, the commander of their brigade, covered with dust and looking as if he was about to tumble from his horse with fatigue. The chagrin on his gross, high-colored, animal face told how deeply he took to heart the disaster that he regarded in the light of a personal misfortune. His command had seen nothing of him since morning. Doubtless he was somewhere on the battlefield, striving to rally the remnants of his brigade, for he was not the man to look closely to his own safety in his rage against those Prussian batteries that had at the same time destroyed the empire and the fortunes of a rising officer, the favorite of the Tuileries."
"Elle l’écoutait maintenant, muette, terrifiée, tandis que Charlot répétait dans son cou, de sa petite voix bégayante :","She listened to him now, mute, terrified, while Charlot repeated in her neck, in his little stammering voice:","She was listening now, mute and terrified, while Chariot, with his face buried in her bosom, kept moaning:","She was listening to him now, tongue-tied and terror-stricken, while little Charlot kept piping in her ear with lisping voice:"
"Au lendemain de Sedan, les deux armées allemandes s’étaient remises à rouler leurs flots d’hommes vers Paris, l’armée de la Meuse arrivait au nord par la vallée de la Marne, tandis que l’armée du prince royal de Prusse, après avoir passé la Seine à Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, se dirigeait sur Versailles, en contournant la ville au sud. Et, ce tiède matin de septembre, quand le général Ducrot, auquel on avait confié le 14e corps, à peine formé, résolut d’attaquer cette dernière, pendant sa marche de flanc, Maurice qui campait dans les bois, à gauche de Meudon, avec son nouveau régiment, le 115e, ne reçut l’ordre de marcher que lorsque le désastre était déjà certain. Quelques obus avaient suffi, une effroyable panique s’était déclarée dans un bataillon de zouaves composé de recrues, le reste des troupes venait d’être emporté, au milieu d’une débandade telle, que ce galop de déroute ne s’arrêta que derrière les remparts, dans Paris, où l’alarme fut immense. Toutes les positions en avant des forts du sud étaient perdues ; et, le soir même, le dernier fil qui reliait la ville à la France, le télégraphe du chemin de fer de l’Ouest, fut coupé. Paris était séparé du monde.","The day after Sedan, the two German armies had resumed rolling their streams of men towards Paris, the Army of the Meuse arrived in the north via the Marne valley, while the army of the Prince Royal of Prussia, after crossing the Seine at Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, headed for Versailles, bypassing the city to the south. And on that warm September morning, when General Ducrot, to whom the 14th corps had been entrusted, barely formed, resolved to attack the latter, during his flank march, Maurice, who was encamped in the woods to the left of Meudon, with his new regiment, the 115th, was ordered to march only when disaster was already certain. A few shells had sufficed, a frightful panic had broken out in a battalion of Zouaves made up of recruits, the rest of the troops had just been swept away, in the midst of such a stampede, that this gallop of rout only stopped behind the ramparts, in Paris, where the alarm was immense. All positions in front of the southern forts were lost; and, that same evening, the last wire which linked the city to France, the telegraph of the western railway, was cut. Paris was separated from the world.","THE very day after Sedan the two German armies resumed the movement of their floods of men towards Paris, the army of the Meuse coming round to the north from the valley of the Marne and the army of the Crown Prince of Prussia crossing the Seine at Villeneuve-Saint-Georges and making for Versailles round the south of the city. On that warm September morning when General Ducrot, who had been put in command of the 14th corps, which had only just been formed, decided to attack the Crown Prince’s army while it was executing its flanking march, Maurice, in camp in the woods to the left of Meudon with his new regiment, the 115th, only received marching orders when disaster was already certain. Just one or two shells had been enough, and a frightful panic had broken out in a battalion of Zouaves made up of recruits, and the rest of the troops had been swept along in such disarray that the stampede never stopped until they were inside the Paris fortifications, where the alarm was intense. All forward positions ahead of the forts to the south were lost, and that same evening the last thread linking the city to France, the telegraph line of the Western Railway, was cut. Paris was separated from the rest of the world.","On the day succeeding the battle of Sedan the mighty hosts of the two German armies, without the delay of a moment, commenced their march on Paris, the army of the Meuse coming in by the north through the valley of the Marne, while the third army, passing the Seine at Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, turned the city to the south and moved on Versailles; and when, on that bright, warm September morning, General Ducrot, to whom had been assigned the command of the as yet incomplete 14th corps, determined to attack the latter force while it was marching by the flank, Maurice's new regiment, the 115th, encamped in the woods to the left of Meudon, did not receive its orders to advance until the day was lost. A few shells from the enemy sufficed to do the work; the panic started with a regiment of zouaves made up of raw recruits, and quickly spreading to the other troops, all were swept away in a headlong rout that never ceased until they were safe behind the walls of Paris, where the utmost consternation prevailed. Every position in advance of the southern line of fortifications was lost, and that evening the wires of the Western Railway telegraph, the city's sole remaining means of communicating with the rest of France, were cut. Paris was cut off from the world."
"Il avait dégagé une des petites mains, il la serrait contre sa bouche, il la baisait, tandis qu’il travaillait pour faire lâcher prise à l’autre.","He had freed one of the little hands, he was holding it to his mouth, he was kissing it, while he worked to get the other one to let go.",He had pulled away one of her little hands and he pressed it to his mouth and kissed it while working at the other to make it let go.,"He had loosened one of the little hands, and carried it to his lips and kissed it, working all the while to make the other release its hold."
– Nous sommes vendus ! répétaient des voix affolées.,- We are sold! repeated panicked voices.,"‘We’ve been sold,’ repeated panic-stricken voices.",“We are betrayed! we are betrayed!” the men wildly repeated.
"À trois reprises déjà, il avait entendu comme un vol d’abeilles.",Three times already he had heard a flight of bees.,Three times already he had heard what he took for a swarm of bees.,Thrice he had heard something that sounded like the humming of a swarm of bees.

"Ce nom fit sursauter l’artilleur. Il braqua ses yeux ardents. Goliath Steinberg, le garçon de ferme, l’homme qui l’avait fâché avec son père, qui lui avait pris Silvine, toute la vilaine histoire, toute l’abominable saleté dont il souffrait encore ! Il aurait couru, l’aurait étranglé. Mais déjà l’homme, au delà des faisceaux, s’en allait, s’évanouissait dans la nuit.","This name startled the gunner. He narrowed his fiery eyes. Goliath Steinberg, the farm boy, the man who had made him angry with his father, who had taken Silvine from him, all the ugly history, all the abominable filth from which he still suffered! He would have run, would have strangled him. But already the man, beyond the beams, was leaving, vanishing into the night.","The name made the artilleryman start. He looked with blazing eyes. Goliath Steinberg, the farm-hand, the man who had made trouble between him and his father, who had taken Silvine away from him, the whole nasty story and abominable corruption that still tortured him. He would have liked to rush over and strangle the man, but by now he was beyond the piled arms and disappearing into the night.","The name made the artilleryman start as if he had been shot; he strained his blazing eyes to follow the receding shape. Goliah Steinberg, the journeyman butcher, the man who had set him and his father by the ears, who had stolen from him his Silvine; the whole base, dirty, miserable story, from which he had not yet ceased to suffer! He would have run after, would have caught him by the throat and strangled him, but the man had already crossed the line of stacked muskets, was moving off and vanishing in the darkness."
"Et, dans la nuit très noire, sur la neige pâle, le petit cortège s’en alla, disparut, sans autre bruit qu’un léger cri plaintif de la brouette.","And, in the very dark night, on the pale snow, the little procession went away, disappeared, without any other noise than a faint plaintive cry from the wheelbarrow.","The little procession disappeared over the snow into the black night, and the only sound to be heard was the melancholy squeaking of the barrow.","And the little procession, dimly outlined against the white waste of snow, started and soon was buried in the blackness of the night, giving no sound save the faint, plaintive creaking of the barrow."
"– N’est-ce pas ? caporal, vous en êtes, continua Loubet, parce que plus nous serons, mieux ça vaudra, avec une si grosse bête… Tenez ! il y en a un, là-bas, que nous guettons depuis une heure, ce grand rouge qui a l’air malade. Ce sera plus facile de l’achever.","- Is not it ? Corporal, you are one of them, continued Loubet, because the more we are, the better it will be, with such a big beast. Hold on! there's one over there we've been watching for an hour, that big red guy who looks sick. It will be easier to finish it.","‘You will be in on it, won’t you, corporal?’ went on Loubet. ‘Because the more of us there are the better, with such a big animal … Look, there’s one over there we’ve been trailing for an hour, that big chestnut that looks sick. It’ll be easier to finish him off.’","“You'll join us, won't you, corporal?” said Loubet, interrupting, “for, with such a big, strong animal to handle, the more of us there are the better it will be. See, there is one, off yonder, that we've been keeping an eye on for the last hour; that big bay that is in such a bad way. He'll be all the easier to finish.”"
"– Que de souffrances, mon Dieu ! On oublie les siennes.","“What suffering, my God! We forget ours.","‘Oh God, what suffering! It makes you forget your own.’","“What suffering all about us, mon Dieu! It makes one forget his own.”"
"Puis, effleurant de ses lèvres les cheveux de sa femme :","Then, touching his wife's hair with his lips:",He touched his wife’s hair with his lips.,"Then, touching his lips to his wife's hair: “My poor Gilberte, to think that a shell may burn us out of house and home at any moment!"

"La campagne restait claire, d’une clarté louche d’entre chien et loup. Et Lapoulle courut le premier, suivi des cinq autres. Il avait pris dans le fossé une grosse pierre ronde, il se rua sur le cheval, se mit à lui défoncer le crâne, de ses deux bras raidis, comme avec une massue. Mais, dès le second coup, le cheval fit un effort pour se remettre debout. Chouteau et Loubet s’étaient jetés en travers de ses jambes, tâchaient de le maintenir, criaient aux autres de les aider. Il hennissait d’une voix presque humaine, éperdue et douloureuse, se débattait, les aurait cassés comme verre, s’il n’avait pas été déjà à demi mort d’inanition. Cependant, sa tête remuait trop, les coups ne portaient plus, Lapoulle ne pouvait le finir.","The countryside remained clear, with a suspicious clearness between dog and wolf. And Lapoulle ran first, followed by the five others. He had taken a large round stone from the ditch, he rushed on the horse, began to smash its skull with his two stiffened arms, as if with a club. But, from the second blow, the horse made an effort to stand up. Chouteau and Loubet threw themselves across his legs, tried to hold him down, shouted to the others to help them. He whinnied in an almost human voice, desperate and painful, struggling, would have broken them like glass, if he had not already been half dead from starvation. However, his head was moving too much, the blows weren't working anymore, Lapoulle couldn't finish him.","The countryside could still be seen in the dim light of dusk. Lapoulle ran first, followed by the five others. He had taken with him from the ditch a big round stone, and he rushed at the horse and began bashing in his skull with both arms straight as though using a club. But at the second blow the horse attempted to stand up. Chouteau and Loubet threw themselves across the horse’s legs, trying to hold him down and shouting for the others to help. The horse whinnyed in an almost human voice in his bewildered grief, and began to struggle and would have broken the men like glass if he had not already been half dead with starvation. But his head was moving too much and the blows were going wide. Lapoulle could not finish him off.","Objects were still discernible in the fields by the uncertain, mysterious light “between dog and wolf,” and Lapoulle went forward first, followed by the five others. He had taken from the ditch a large, rounded boulder, and, with it in his two brawny hands, rushing upon the horse, commenced to batter at his skull as with a club. At the second blow, however, the horse, stung by the pain, attempted to get on his feet. Chouteau and Loubet had thrown themselves across his legs and were endeavoring to hold him down, shouting to the others to help them. The poor brute's cries were almost human in their accent of terror and distress; he struggled desperately to shake off his assailants, and would have broken them like a reed had he not been half dead with inanition. The movements of his head prevented the blows from taking effect; Lapoulle was unable to despatch him."
"Pourtant, il n’osa empêcher Maurice et Prosper de descendre Jean de cheval et de l’allonger sur la grande table de la cuisine. Silvine courut chercher son propre traversin, qu’elle glissa sous la tête du blessé, toujours évanoui. Mais le vieux grondait, exaspéré de voir cet homme sur sa table, disant qu’il y était fort mal, demandant pourquoi on ne le portait pas tout de suite à l’ambulance, puisqu’on avait la chance d’avoir une ambulance à Remilly, près de l’église, dans l’ancienne maison d’école, un reste de couvent, où se trouvait une grande salle très commode.","However, he dared not prevent Maurice and Prosper from dismounting Jean from his horse and laying him down on the large kitchen table. Silvine ran to get her own bolster, which she slipped under the injured man's head, still unconscious. But the old man growled, exasperated to see this man on his table, saying that he was in very bad shape, asking why they didn't take him to the ambulance right away, since we were lucky enough to have an ambulance in Remilly, near the church, in the old school house, the remains of a convent, where there was a large, very comfortable room.","Yet he dared not prevent Maurice and Prosper from getting Jean down from the horse and laying him on the big kitchen table. Silvine ran off and got her own bolster, which she slipped under the wounded man’s head, for he was still unconscious. But the old boy, annoyed at seeing this man on his table, grumbled away, saying that he was very uncomfortable like that and why didn’t they take him straight to the field hospital, as they were lucky enough to have one at Remilly, near the church, in the old schoolhouse which had once been a convent and in which there was a very convenient large hall.","He did not go so far, however, as to prohibit Maurice and Prosper from taking Jean from the horse and laying him on the great table in the kitchen. Silvine ran and got the bolster from her bed and slipped it beneath the head of the wounded man, who was still unconscious. But it irritated the old fellow to see the man lying on his table; he grumbled and fretted, saying that the kitchen was no place for him; why did they not take him away to the hospital at once? since there fortunately was a hospital at Remilly, near the church, in the old schoolhouse; and there was a big room in it, with everything nice and comfortable."
"Gilberte courut, revint avec la serviette, voulut lui en frotter les mains elle-même. À partir de ce moment, il montra un très grand courage, soucieux de finir en homme de bonne compagnie. Delaherche l’encourageait, aidait sa femme à l’arranger d’une façon convenable. Et la vieille madame Delaherche, devant ce mourant, lorsqu’elle vit le ménage s’empresser ainsi, sentit s’en aller sa rancune. Une fois encore elle se tairait, elle qui savait et qui s’était juré de tout dire à son fils. À quoi bon désoler la maison, puisque la mort emportait la faute ?","Gilberte ran, came back with the napkin, tried to rub her hands with it herself. From that moment, he showed great courage, anxious to end up as a man of good company. Delaherche encouraged him, helped his wife to arrange him in a suitable way. And old Madame Delaherche, in the face of this dying man, when she saw the household hastening thus, felt her resentment go away. Once again she would be silent, she who knew and who had sworn to tell her son everything. What good was it to desolate the house, since death took away the fault?","Gilberte ran off and came back with the towel and insisted on wiping his hands herself. From then on he displayed very great courage, anxious to end like a man of good breeding. Delaherche said comforting things and helped his wife to make him presentable. As she watched this dying man, and both husband and wife busying themselves for him in this way, old Madame Delaherche felt her resentment melt away. Once again she would hold her peace, though she knew and had sworn to tell her son everything. What was to be gained by casting a blight on the home since death was washing away the sin?","Gilberte sped away and quickly returned with the napkin, with which she herself cleansed the hands of the dying man. Thenceforth, desirous of quitting the scene with dignity, he displayed much firmness. Delaherche did what he could to cheer him, and assisted his wife in the small attentions she offered for his comfort. Old Mme. Delaherche, too, in presence of the man whose hours were numbered, felt her enmity subsiding. She would be silent, she who knew all and had sworn to impart her knowledge to her son. What would it avail to excite discord in the household, since death would soon obliterate all trace of the wrong?"
– Eh bien ! qu’est-ce que ça leur fout d’être vendus ?… Est-ce que ça les regarde ?… Ça n’empêche pas que les Prussiens sont là et que nous allons leur allonger une de ces raclées dont on se souvient.,- Well ! What do they care if they are sold?... Does that concern them?... That does not prevent the Prussians from being there and we are going to give them one of those beatings that we remember.,"‘Well, what the fuck does it matter to them if we are sold? What business is it of theirs? It doesn’t alter the fact that the Prussians are here and that we’ve got to give them one of those thrashings you don’t forget in a hurry.’","“Well, suppose they are sold, is it any of their business? What concern is it of theirs? The Prussians are there all the same, aren't they? and we are going to give them one of the old-fashioned hidings, such as they won't forget in one while.”"
"En songeant à ces choses, désespéré et frémissant, Maurice suivait l’ombre, sur la mousseline légère de la bonne madame Desroches, l’ombre fiévreuse, piétinante, que semblait pousser l’impitoyable voix, venue de Paris. Cette nuit-là, l’impératrice n’avait-elle pas souhaité la mort du père, pour que le fils régnât ? Marche ! marche ! sans regarder en arrière, sous la pluie, dans la boue, à l’extermination, afin que cette partie suprême de l’Empire à l’agonie soit jouée jusqu’à la dernière carte. Marche ! marche ! meurs en héros sur les cadavres entassés de ton peuple, frappe le monde entier d’une admiration émue, si tu veux qu’il pardonne à ta descendance ! Et sans doute l’empereur marchait à la mort. En bas, la cuisine ne flambait plus, les écuyers, les aides de camp, les chambellans dormaient, toute la maison était noire ; tandis que, seule, l’ombre allait et revenait sans cesse, résignée à la fatalité du sacrifice, au milieu de l’assourdissant vacarme du 12e corps, qui continuait de défiler, dans les ténèbres.","Thinking of these things, in despair and trembling, Maurice followed the shadow on the light muslin of good Madame Desroches, the feverish, stamping shadow which the pitiless voice from Paris seemed to urge. That night, hadn't the Empress wished for the death of the father, so that the son might reign? Walk ! walk ! without looking back, in the rain, in the mud, to extermination, so that this supreme part of the Empire in agony is played until the last card. Walk ! walk ! die like heroes over the piled up corpses of your people, strike the whole world with moved admiration, if you want it to forgive your descendants! And no doubt the Emperor was marching to death. Downstairs, the kitchen was no longer on fire, the squires, aides-de-camp, chamberlains were asleep, the whole house was dark; while, alone, the shadow kept coming and going, resigned to the fatality of the sacrifice, amidst the deafening din of the 12th corps, which continued to parade in the darkness.","Thinking over these things, shivering in despair, Maurice still followed that shadow on Madame Desroches’s thin muslin – that feverish, pacing shadow driven on by the relentless voice from Paris. Had not the Empress, that very night, wished for the Emperor’s death so that her son might reign? March on! March on! Never look back, in rain, through mud, to extermination, so that this crucial game of the dying Empire be played out to the last card. March on! March on! Die like a hero on the heaped corpses of your people, fill the whole world with wonder and awe if you want it to forgive your successors! And without doubt the Emperor was marching on to death. Downstairs the kitchen was no longer ablaze, the equerries, aides-de-camp and officials were fast asleep and the whole building was in blackness; but alone the shadow paced ceaselessly up and down, resigned to the inevitability of the sacrifice amidst the deafening din of the 12th corps still going by in the dark.","While pursuing this train of thought Maurice was watching the shadow that still kept appearing and vanishing on the muslin of good Madame Desvallieres' curtain, as if it felt the lash of the pitiless voice that came to it from Paris. Had the Empress that night desired the death of the father in order that the son might reign? March! forward ever! with no look backward, through mud, through rain, to bitter death, that the final game of the agonizing empire may be played out, even to the last card. March! march! die a hero's death on the piled corpses of your people, let the whole world gaze in awe-struck admiration, for the honor and glory of your name! And doubtless the Emperor was marching to his death. Below, the fires in the kitchen flamed and flashed no longer; equerries, aides-de-camp and chamberlains were slumbering, the whole house was wrapped in darkness, while ever the lone shade went and came unceasingly, accepting with resignation the sacrifice that was to be, amid the deafening uproar of the 12th corps, that was defiling still through the black night."
"Des têtes se tournèrent, on lui demanda s’il avait vu ça en rêve. Non, il n’avait rien rêvé ; seulement, il le sentait, c’était là.","Heads turned, he was asked if he had seen this in his dream. No, he had not dreamed anything; only, he felt it, it was there.","Heads turned round and asked if he had seen that in a dream. No, he hadn’t dreamed anything, just felt it, and there it was.","The near files turned and looked at him curiously, asking him if he had had a dream. No, he had dreamed nothing, but he felt it; it was there."
"L’œil du vieux avait brillé. Il trinqua encore, il conclut sans hâte :","The old man's eye had shone. He clinked glasses again, he concluded without haste:",The old man’s eyes glittered. He held up his glass once again and concluded the business without undue haste:,"The old fellow's eyes gleamed, but he touched glasses once more with the other and concluded the arrangement without any evidence of eagerness."
– À votre santé ! reprit-il en trinquant avec les trois hommes.,"- Cheers ! he resumed, toasting with the three men.","‘Your good health,’ he said, clinking glasses with the three men.","“Your good health!” said he, touching glasses with the three men."

Me, you did well to cut me down, since I was the ulcer stuck to your bones!","‘My dear old Jean, you are the pure in heart, the stout-hearted one … Go and take up your pick and trowel, turn over the soil and rebuild the house! … As for me, you did the best thing when you cut me out, for I was the ulcer clinging to your bones!’","“Jean, old friend, you and those like you are strong in your simplicity and honesty. Go, take up the spade and the trowel, turn the sod in the abandoned field, rebuild the house! As for me, you did well to lop me off, since I was the ulcer that was eating away your strength!”"
"Le colonel de Vineuil vint s’assurer de la bonne position de son régiment, pour la nuit. Il s’étonna de ne pas trouver à son poste le capitaine Beaudoin ; et, comme celui-ci rentrait de Vouziers à cette minute même, donnant l’excuse qu’il y avait déjeuné, chez la baronne de Ladicourt, il reçut une rude réprimande, qu’il écouta d’ailleurs en silence, de son air correct de bel officier.","Colonel de Vineuil came to make sure of the good position of his regiment for the night. He was surprised not to find Captain Beaudoin at his post; and, as the latter was returning from Vouziers at that very moment, giving the excuse that he had lunched there at the Baroness de Ladicourt's, he received a harsh reprimand, which he listened to in silence, in his good looking officer.","Colonel de Vineuil came to make sure that his regiment was in a good position for the night. He was astonished not to find Captain Beaudoin at his post; and as he came back at that very moment from Vouziers, giving the excuse that he had been to lunch with the Baroness de Ladicourt, he received a severe reprimand, which he heard in silence, looking the essence of the good officer.","Colonel de Vineuil came to look after his regiment's position for the night. He was surprised not to find Captain Beaudoin at his post, and as that officer just then chanced to come in from Vouziers, where he alleged in excuse for his absence that he had been breakfasting with the Baronne de Ladicourt, he received a sharp reprimand, which he digested in silence, with the rigid manner of a martinet conscious of being in the wrong."
"Henriette, quand elle connut toutes ces histoires, fut terriblement inquiète. De nouveau, redoutant de compromettre ses hôtes, Jean voulait partir, bien que le docteur le trouvât trop faible encore ; et elle tenait à ce qu’il attendît une quinzaine de jours, envahie elle-même d’un redoublement de tristesse, devant la nécessité prochaine de la séparation. Lors de l’arrestation du père Fouchard, Jean avait pu s’échapper, en se cachant au fond de la grange ; mais ne restait-il pas en danger d’être pris et emmené d’une heure à l’autre, dans le cas possible de nouvelles recherches ? D’ailleurs, elle tremblait aussi sur le sort de l’oncle. Elle résolut donc d’aller un matin, à Sedan, voir les Delaherche, qui logeaient chez eux, affirmait-on, un officier prussien très puissant.","Henriette, when she heard all these stories, was terribly worried. Again, fearing to compromise his hosts, Jean wanted to leave, although the doctor still found him too weak; and she wanted him to wait a fortnight, herself overwhelmed with redoubled sadness at the approaching necessity of separation. When Father Fouchard was arrested, Jean had been able to escape by hiding at the back of the barn; but was he not in danger of being picked up and taken away any hour, in the event of a new search? Besides, she also trembled over the fate of her uncle. She therefore resolved to go one morning to Sedan to see the Delaherches, who were staying with them, it was said, a very powerful Prussian officer.","Henriette was terribly worried when she heard about all this business. Once again Jean wanted to go away for fear of compromising the people who had harboured him, although the doctor thought he was still not strong enough, and she insisted that he should wait two more weeks, being herself oppressed with renewed sadness at the coming necessity of a separation. When old Fouchard was arrested Jean had been able to avoid capture by hiding in the depths of the barn, but wasn’t he in constant danger of being discovered and taken away at any moment in the likely event of further searches? And besides, she was worried about her uncle’s fate. So she decided to go into Sedan one morning and see the Delaherches, who had billeted on them, it was said, a very influential Prussian officer.","All these stories were a terrible source of alarm to Henriette when she came to hear of them. Jean, fearing he might endanger the safety of his hosts, was again eager to get away, although the doctor declared he was still too weak, and she, saddened by the prospect of their approaching separation, insisted on his delaying his departure for two weeks. At the time of Father Fouchard's arrest Jean had escaped a like fate by hiding in the barn, but he was liable to be taken and led away captive at any moment should there be further searches made. She was also anxious as to her uncle's fate, and so she resolved one morning to go to Sedan and see the Delaherches, who had, it was said, a Prussian officer of great influence quartered in their house."
"La maison des Weiss se trouvait vers le milieu de Bazeilles, à droite, avant d’arriver à la place de l’Église. La façade, un peu en retrait, donnait sur la route, un seul étage de trois fenêtres, surmonté d’un grenier ; mais, derrière, il y avait un jardin assez vaste, dont la pente descendait vers les prairies, et d’où l’on découvrait l’immense panorama des coteaux, depuis Remilly jusqu’à Frénois. Et Weiss, dans sa ferveur de nouveau propriétaire, ne s’était guère couché que vers deux heures du matin, après avoir enfoui dans sa cave toutes les provisions et s’être ingénié à protéger les meubles autant que possible contre les balles, en garnissant les fenêtres de matelas. Une colère montait en lui, à l’idée que les Prussiens pouvaient venir saccager cette maison si désirée, si difficilement acquise et dont il avait encore joui si peu.","The Weiss house was in the middle of Bazeilles, on the right, before arriving at the Place de l'Eglise. The facade, set back a little, overlooked the road, a single storey of three windows, surmounted by an attic; but, behind, there was a fairly large garden, the slope of which descended towards the meadows, and from which one discovered the immense panorama of the hills, from Remilly to Frénois. And Weiss, in his fervor as a new owner, had barely gone to bed until about two o'clock in the morning, after having buried all the provisions in his cellar and having done his best to protect the furniture as much as possible against bullets, by furnishing mattress windows. Anger rose in him at the idea that the Prussians could come and ransack this house so desired, so difficult to acquire and which he had yet enjoyed so little.","The Weisses’ house was about in the centre of Bazeilles, on the right before you reach the Place de l’Eglise. The front, standing a little back, faced the road and had only one storey above the ground floor with three windows, and a loft above, but there was quite a large garden behind which sloped down to the meadows and from which could be seen the immense panorama of the hills from Remilly to Frénois. Weiss, in the excitement of new ownership, had not gone to bed until nearly two after he had buried all the provisions in his cellar and worked out how to protect the furniture as well as possible from bullets by draping the windows with mattresses. He felt anger rising within him when he reflected that the Prussians might come and sack this house he had longed for so much, acquired with so much difficulty and so far enjoyed so little.","Weiss's house was situated near the middle of the village, on the right of the road and not far from the Place de l'Eglise. Its front, standing back a little from the street, displayed a single story with three windows, surmounted by an attic; in the rear was a garden of some extent that sloped gently downward toward the meadows and commanded a wide panoramic view of the encircling hills, from Remilly to Frenois. Weiss, with the sense of responsibility of his new proprietorship strong upon him, had spent the night in burying his provisions in the cellar and protecting his furniture, as far as possible, against shot and shell by applying mattresses to the windows, so that it was nearly two o'clock before he got to bed. His blood boiled at the idea that the Prussians might come and plunder the house, for which he had toiled so long and which had as yet afforded him so little enjoyment."
"Et ce fut madame Delaherche qui s’empara de l’épée. Puis, devant le désespoir de M. de Vineuil, au lieu de la cacher, comme son fils lui disait de le faire, elle la brisa d’un coup sec, sur son genou, avec une force extraordinaire, dont elle-même n’aurait pas cru capables ses pauvres mains. Le colonel s’était recouché, et il pleura, en regardant sa vieille amie d’un air d’infinie douceur.","And it was Madame Delaherche who seized the sword. Then, in the face of M. de Vineuil's despair, instead of hiding it, as her son told her to do, she broke it with a sharp blow, on her knee, with extraordinary force, which she herself could not do. would not have thought his poor hands capable. The colonel had gone back to bed, and wept, gazing at his old friend with an air of infinite gentleness.","It was Madame Delaherche who took possession of the sword. Then, seeing Monsieur de Vineuil’s despair, instead of hiding it as her son told her to, she herself broke it with one smart tap over her knee, with a superhuman strength she would not have thought her old hands capable of. The colonel had sunk down again and he was crying as he looked at his old friend with infinite tenderness.","Mme. Delaherche took possession of the sword. With a feeling of compassionate respect for the poor colonel's grief and despair she did not conceal it, as her son bade her do, but with a single vigorous effort snapped it across her knee, with a strength of which she herself would never have supposed her poor old hands capable. The colonel laid himself down again, casting a look of extreme gentleness upon his old friend, who went back to her chair and seated herself in her usual rigid attitude."
"Jean eut toutes les peines du monde à le remettre au lit, tandis qu’Henriette, en larmes, lui parlait de leur enfance, le suppliait de se calmer, au nom de leur adoration. Et, sur Paris immense, le reflet de braise avait encore grandi, la mer de flammes semblait gagner les lointains ténébreux de l’horizon, le ciel était comme la voûte d’un four géant, chauffé au rouge clair. Et, dans cette clarté fauve des incendies, les grosses fumées du ministère des Finances, qui brûlait obstinément depuis l’avant-veille, sans une flamme, passaient toujours en une sombre et lente nuée de deuil.","Jean had all the trouble in the world to get him back to bed, while Henriette, in tears, spoke to him of their childhood, begged him to calm down, in the name of their adoration. And, on immense Paris, the reflection of embers had grown still larger, the sea of flames seemed to reach the dark distances of the horizon, the sky was like the vault of a giant oven, heated to a light red. And, in this tawny brightness of the fires, the great smoke from the Ministry of Finance, which had been burning stubbornly since two days before, without a flame, still passed in a dark and slow cloud of mourning.","Jean had all the trouble in the world to get him back into bed, while Henriette in tears went on talking to him about their childhood together, begging him to calm down in the name of their love for each other. Over the vast space of Paris the fiery glow had spread still more, and the sea of flame seemed to be reaching the dark limits of the horizon, the sky was like the vault of a gigantic furnace, heated up to bright red. The dense smoke clouds from the Ministry of Finance, which had been steadily burning for two days without any flames, still floated across this lurid background of fires like a stately cloud of deepest mourning.","Jean had the utmost difficulty in getting him back to bed, while Henriette tearfully recalled memories of their childhood, and entreated him, for the sake of the love they bore each other, to be calm. Over the immensity of Paris the fiery glow deepened and widened; the sea of flame seemed to be invading the remotest quarters of the horizon; the heavens were like the vaults of a colossal oven, heated to red heat. And athwart the red light of the conflagrations the dense black smoke-clouds from the Ministry of Finance, which had been burning three days and given forth no blaze, continued to pour in unbroken, slow procession."
"– Oui, oui, ne t’inquiète pas. J’arriverai toujours, mort ou vivant.","- Yes, yes, don't worry. I will always arrive, dead or alive.","‘Yes, yes, don’t you worry. I shall get there somehow, dead or alive.’","“Yes, yes; don't be alarmed. I'll get there somehow, alive or dead.”"
"– Surtout, insista Fouchard, collez-lui deux bons cailloux aux pattes, que le bougre ne remonte pas !","“Above all,” insisted Fouchard, “stick two good pebbles to his feet, so that the bugger doesn't go up!","‘Above all,’ insisted Fouchard, ‘tie two big stones to the feet so that the bugger doesn’t come up again!’","“Be sure and fasten a couple of big stones to his feet,” recommended Fouchard, “so the lubber shan't come up again.”"
"Jean, à mesure que le jour grandissait, tâchait de s’orienter. On lui avait montré, au nord-ouest, de l’autre côté de Quatre-Champs, le chemin du Chesne, qui filait sur un coteau. Alors, pourquoi avait-on tourné à droite, au lieu de tourner à gauche ? Puis, ce qui l’intéressait, c’était l’état-major installé à la Converserie, une ferme plantée au bord du plateau. On y semblait très effaré, des officiers couraient, discutaient, avec de grands gestes. Et rien ne venait, que pouvaient-ils attendre ? Le plateau était une sorte de cirque, des chaumes à l’infini, que dominaient, au nord et à l’est, des hauteurs boisées ; vers le sud, s’étendaient des bois épais ; tandis que, par une échappée, à l’ouest, on apercevait la vallée de l’Aisne, avec les petites maisons blanches de Vouziers. En dessous de la Converserie, pointait le clocher d’ardoises de Quatre-Champs, noyé dans l’averse enragée, sous laquelle semblaient se fondre les quelques pauvres toits moussus du village. Et, comme Jean enfilait du regard la rue montante, il distingua très bien un cabriolet arrivant au grand trot, par la chaussée caillouteuse, changée en torrent.","Jean, as the day grew, tried to orient himself. He had been shown, to the northwest, on the other side of Quatre-Champs, the Chemin du Chesne, which ran along a hillside. So why had we turned right, instead of turning left? Then, what interested him was the staff installed at the Converserie, a farm planted at the edge of the plateau. People seemed very frightened there, officers were running, discussing, with great gestures. And nothing was coming, what could they expect? The plateau was a kind of circus, endless stubble, dominated, to the north and east, by wooded heights; to the south lay thick woods; while, through a breakaway to the west, you could see the valley of the Aisne, with the little white houses of Vouziers. Below the Converserie rose the slate steeple of Quatre-Champs, drowned in the raging downpour, under which the few poor mossy roofs of the village seemed to melt. And, as Jean gazed up the uphill street, he could clearly make out a cabriolet arriving at a brisk trot, over the stony roadway, which had turned into a torrent.","As it grew lighter Jean tried to get his bearings. He had been shown the Le Chêne road going off north-west up a hill the other side of Quatre-Champs. Well, why had they turned right instead of left? What interested him was the headquarters set up in La Converserie, a farmhouse perched on the edge of the plateau. They seemed to be very perturbed there, with officers running about and arguing and gesticulating. But nothing was coming, what could they be waiting for? The plateau formed a sort of circus – bare stubble stretching on and on, dominated on the north and east by wooded uplands; southwards there were extensive thick woods while to the west could be seen a glimpse of the Aisne valley with the little white houses of Vouziers. Below La Converserie the slate steeple of Quatre-Champs stood out, drowned in sheets of rain which seemed to be melting away the few miserable mossy roofs of the village. As Jean ran his eye up the hilly road he saw quite clearly a trap bowling quite fast along the stony track which was now a torrent.","As the daylight increased Jean made an attempt to discern where they were. Someone had shown him where the Chene road lay off to the northwest, passing over a hill beyond Quatre-Champs. Why had they turned to the right instead of to the left? Another object of interest to him was the general and his staff, who had established themselves at the Converserie, a farm on the edge of the plateau. There seemed to be a heated discussion going on; officers were going and coming and the conversation was carried on with much gesticulation. What could they be waiting for? nothing was coming that way. The plateau formed a sort of amphitheater, broad expanses of stubble that were commanded to the north and east by wooded heights; to the south were thick woods, while to the west an opening afforded a glimpse of the valley of the Aisne with the little white houses of Vouziers. Below the Converserie rose the slated steeple of Quatre-Champs church, looming dimly through the furious storm, which seemed as if it would sweep away bodily the few poor moss-grown cottages of the village. As Jean's glance wandered down the ascending road he became conscious of a doctor's gig coming up at a sharp trot along the stony road , that was now the bed of a rapid torrent."
"Mais, d’un geste terrifié, Jean le fit taire, comme s’il avait craint qu’un tel blasphème ne leur portât malheur. Était-ce possible qu’un garçon qu’il aimait tant, si instruit, si délicat, en fût arrivé à des idées pareilles ? Et il ramait plus fort, car il avait dépassé le pont de Solférino, il se trouvait maintenant dans un large espace découvert. La clarté devenait telle, que la rivière était éclairée comme par le soleil de midi, tombant d’aplomb, sans une ombre. On distinguait les moindres détails avec une précision singulière, les moires du courant, les tas de graviers des berges, les petits arbres des quais. Surtout, les ponts apparaissaient, d’une blancheur éclatante, si nets, qu’on en aurait compté les pierres ; et l’on aurait dit, d’un incendie à l’autre, de minces passerelles intactes, au-dessus de cette eau braisillante. Par moments, au milieu de la clameur grondante et continue, de brusques craquements se faisaient entendre. Des rafales de suie tombaient, le vent apportait des odeurs empestées. Et l’épouvantement, c’était que Paris, les autres quartiers lointains, là-bas, au fond de la trouée de la Seine, n’existaient plus. À droite, à gauche, la violence des incendies éblouissait, creusait au delà un abîme noir. On ne voyait plus qu’une énormité ténébreuse, un néant, comme si Paris tout entier, gagné par le feu, fût dévoré, eût déjà disparu dans une éternelle nuit. Et le ciel aussi était mort, les flammes montaient si haut, qu’elles éteignaient les étoiles.","But, with a terrified gesture, Jean silenced him, as if he had feared that such blasphemy would bring them bad luck. Was it possible that a boy he loved so much, so educated, so delicate, had come to such ideas? And he was rowing harder, for he had passed the Solferino bridge, he now found himself in a wide open space. The brightness became such that the river was lighted up as if by the noonday sun, falling plumb, without a shadow. You could make out the smallest details with singular precision, the waters of the current, the heaps of gravel on the banks, the small trees on the quays. Above all, the bridges appeared, of a dazzling whiteness, so neat, that one would have counted the stones; and from one fire to another they looked like thin unbroken footbridges over the boiling water. At times, in the midst of the booming and continuous clamor, sudden cracks were heard. Gusts of soot fell, the wind brought foul odors. And the horror was that Paris, the other distant districts, over there, at the bottom of the gap in the Seine, no longer existed. To the right, to the left, the violence of the fires dazzled, hollowed out a black abyss beyond. All that was seen was a dark enormity, a nothingness, as if all of Paris, taken by fire, had been devoured, had already disappeared in an eternal night. And the sky was also dead, the flames rising so high that they extinguished the stars.","Jean stopped him with a terrified gesture, as though afraid such a blasphemy would bring a curse upon them. Could it possibly be that a man he loved so dearly, who was so well educated, so delicate in mind, had come down to such notions? He was now rowing harder, for he had passed the Solferino bridge and was in a broad, open reach. The light was as bright as a noonday sun shining straight down on the river without casting any shadow. The smallest details could be picked out with astonishing precision, the flecks of the current, heaps of stones on the towpaths, little trees on the embankments. The bridges especially stood out in blinding whiteness, so clear that you could have counted the blocks of stone, and they looked like narrow, intact passages from one fire to another over the fiery water. Occasionally, in the continuous roaring noise, sudden crashes could be heard. Flurries of soot came down and foul stenches were borne on the wind. The terrifying thing was that Paris, that is to say all the other districts further away along the trench of the Seine, had ceased to exist. On either side the very violence of the conflagration so dazzled the eyes that there was nothing but a black abyss beyond. Nothing could be seen but an enormous darkness, a void, as if the whole of Paris had been seized and devoured by the fire and disappeared into eternal night. The sky was dead too, for the flames shot so high that they put out the stars.","But Jean silenced him with a terrified gesture, as if he feared such blasphemy might bring them evil. Where could a young man whom he loved so fondly, so delicately nurtured, so well informed, have picked up such ideas? And he applied himself more vigorously to the oars, for they had now passed the bridge of Solferino and were come out into a wide open space of water. The light was so intense that the river was illuminated as by the noonday sun when it stands vertically above men's heads and casts no shadow. The most minute objects, such as the eddies in the stream, the stones piled on the banks, the small trees along the quais, stood out before their vision with wonderful distinctness. The bridges, too, were particularly noticeable in their dazzling whiteness, and so clearly defined that they could have counted every stone; they had the appearance of narrow gangways thrown across the fiery stream to connect one conflagration with the other. Amid the roar of the flames and the general clamor a loud crash occasionally announced the fall of some stately edifice. Dense clouds of soot hung in the air and settled everywhere, the wind brought odors of pestilence on its wings. And another horror was that Paris, those more distant quarters of the city that lay back from the banks of the Seine, had ceased to exist for them. To right and left of the conflagration that raged with such fierce resplendency was an unfathomable gulf of blackness; all that presented itself to their strained gaze was a vast waste of shadow, an empty void, as if the devouring element had reached the utmost limits of the city and all Paris were swallowed up in everlasting night. And the heavens, too, were dead and lifeless; the flames rose so high that they extinguished the stars."
"– Non, je crois bien que je vais mourir.","- No, I think I'm going to die.","‘No, I’m sure I’m going to die.’","“No, it is not worth while; I feel that I am going to die.”"
"Le révolutionnaire revenait chez ce grand diable de peintre en bâtiments, beau parleur de Montmartre, théoricien de cabaret, gâtant les quelques idées justes, attrapées çà et là, dans le plus effroyable mélange d’âneries et de mensonges.","The revolutionary returned to that great devil of a house painter, smooth talker from Montmartre, cabaret theoretician, spoiling the few correct ideas, caught here and there, in the most appalling mixture of nonsense and lies.","The revolutionary was raising his head again in this great oaf of a house-painter, the Montmartre orator, the public-bar theorist who spoiled the few good ideas he picked up here and there in the most appalling mess-up of rubbish and lies.","The radical was cropping out again in the great hulking house-painter, the orator of Belleville, the pothouse politician, who drowned what few correct ideas he picked up here and there in a nauseous mixture of ineffable folly and falsehood."
"Mais, d’un geste encore, il invita son état-major à le suivre, sans l’épargner cette fois, pas plus qu’il ne s’épargnait lui-même ; et il monta vers la Moncelle, à travers champs, par les terrains nus de la Rapaille. Un capitaine fut tué, deux chevaux s’abattirent. Les régiments du 12e corps, devant lesquels il passait, le regardaient venir et disparaître comme un spectre, sans un salut, sans une acclamation.","But, with a gesture again, he invited his staff to follow him, without sparing him this time, any more than he was sparing himself; and he climbed towards La Moncelle, across the fields, over the bare ground of La Rapaille. A captain was killed, two horses fell. The regiments of the 12th corps, in front of which he passed, watched him come and disappear like a specter, without a salute, without an acclamation.","But with another gesture he invited his staff to follow him, without sparing them this time any more than he spared himself, and he rode up towards La Moncelle over the fields and the open ground of La Rapaille. One captain was killed and two horses were brought down. He passed in front of the regiments of the 12th corps, who watched him come and go like a ghost, with no salute, no acclaim.","But, unmindful of their solicitations, he beckoned to his staff to follow him, not offering at present to consult their safety more than he did his own, and turned his horse's head toward la Moncelle, quitting the road and taking the abandoned fields of la Ripaille. A captain was mortally wounded, two horses were killed. As he passed along the line of the 12th corps, appearing and vanishing like a specter, the men eyed him with curiosity, but did not cheer."
"– Oh ! le malin, il ne les voit pas !… Ouvre donc tes quinquets, imbécile !… Tiens ! en voici une, tiens ! en voici une autre… Tu ne l’as pas vue, celle-là ? elle était verte.","- Oh ! the evil one, he does not see them!... Open your quinquets, imbecile!... Here! here's one, hey! here's another one... Haven't you seen that one? it was green.","‘Oh the artful old devil, he can’t see them! Open your optics, you fool! Look, there’s one, there’s another!… Didn’t you spot that one? It was green.’","“Oh, crickey! he says he can't see them! Open your garret windows, stupid! See! there's one—see! there's another. Didn't you see that one? It was of the most beautiful green.”"
"Le père Fouchard s’était rapproché de la fenêtre, criant qu’on partait. Réveillés, frissonnants et engourdis, Jean et Maurice se mirent debout. Vivement, Honoré avait serré les deux mains de Silvine dans les siennes.","Father Fouchard had approached the window, shouting that we were leaving. Awake, shivering and numb, Jean and Maurice got to their feet. Quickly, Honoré had clasped both Silvine's hands in his own.","Old Fouchard had come back to the window shouting that they were off. Jean and Maurice woke up, shivering and aching, and jumped to their feet. Honoré quickly squeezed Silvine’s hand in his.","Father Fouchard came to the window and shouted that the troops were moving. Jean and Maurice awoke, stiff and shivering, and got on their feet. Honore took Silvine's hands in his and gave them a swift parting clasp."
"Sur le plateau de Floing, au petit jour, dans le brouillard épais, le clairon Gaude sonna la diane, de tout son souffle. Mais l’air était si noyé d’eau, que la sonnerie joyeuse s’étouffait. Et les hommes de la compagnie, qui n’avaient pas même eu le courage de dresser les tentes, roulés dans les toiles, couchés dans la boue, ne s’éveillaient pas, pareils déjà à des cadavres, avec leurs faces blêmes, durcies de fatigue et de sommeil. Il fallut les secouer un à un, les tirer de ce néant ; et ils se soulevaient comme des ressuscités, livides, les yeux pleins de la terreur de vivre.","On the plateau of Floing, at dawn, in the thick fog, the bugler Gaude sounded the diane, with all his breath. But the air was so waterlogged that the joyful ringing was muffled. And the men of the company, who had not even had the courage to pitch the tents, rolled up in the canvases, lying in the mud, did not wake up, already like corpses, with their pale faces, hardened with fatigue and sleep. They had to be shaken one by one, pulled out of this nothingness; and they arose like the resuscitated, livid, their eyes full of the terror of living.","AT first light on the plateau of Floing, in a thick fog, Gaude’s bugle sounded reveille for all it was worth. But the air was so saturated with moisture that the merry tune was muffled. Nevertheless the men of the company, who had not even had the heart to put up the tents but had rolled themselves up in the canvas and lain in the mud, did not even wake up but were like a lot of corpses already with pallid faces, stiff with fatigue and sleep, and had to be shaken one by one and pulled out of their torpor. They rose up as if from the dead, ghastly looking, with eyes full of the terror of being alive.","In the dense fog up on the plateau of Floing Gaude, the bugler, sounded reveille at peep of day with all the lung-power he was possessed of, but the inspiring strain died away and was lost in the damp, heavy air, and the men, who had not had courage even to erect their tents and had thrown themselves, wrapped in their blankets, upon the muddy ground, did not awake or stir, but lay like corpses, their ashen features set and rigid in the slumber of utter exhaustion. To arouse them from their trance-like sleep they had to be shaken, one by one, and, with ghastly faces and haggard eyes, they rose to their feet, like beings summoned, against their will, back from another world."
"Et sa colère tomba, il se mit à pleurer à chaudes larmes.","And his anger fell, he began to cry hot tears.",His anger vanished and he began to cry bitterly.,His anger subsided and he began to weep scalding tears.
"– Oh ! mon petit, mon pauvre petit !","- Oh ! my little one, my poor little one!","‘Oh, my dearest boy, my poor dear boy!’","“My boy, oh! my poor, poor boy!”"
"Henriette acheva la lettre, qui finissait en signalant l’approche des Allemands. Le 13, le jour même où une délégation du gouvernement de la Défense nationale s’installait à Tours, on les avait vus, à l’est de Paris, s’avancer jusqu’à Lagny. Le 14 et le 15, ils étaient aux portes, à Créteil et à Joinville-le-Pont. Mais, le 18, le matin où il avait écrit, Maurice ne paraissait pas croire encore à la possibilité d’investir Paris complètement, repris d’une belle confiance, regardant le siège comme une tentative insolente et hasardée qui échouerait avant trois semaines, comptant sur les armées de secours que la province allait sûrement envoyer, sans parler de l’armée de Metz, en marche déjà, par Verdun et Reims. Et les anneaux de la ceinture de fer s’étaient rejoints, avaient bouclé Paris, et Paris maintenant, séparé du monde, n’était plus que la prison géante de deux millions de vivants, d’où ne venait qu’un silence de mort.","Henriette finished the letter, which ended by signaling the approach of the Germans. On the 13th, the very day when a delegation from the government of National Defense was settling in Tours, we had seen them, to the east of Paris, advancing as far as Lagny. On the 14th and 15th, they were at the gates, at Créteil and at Joinville-le-Pont. But on the 18th, the morning on which he had written, Maurice still did not seem to believe in the possibility of besieging Paris completely, regained a beautiful confidence, regarding the siege as an insolent and risky attempt which would fail within three weeks, counting on the relief armies which the provinces would surely send, not to mention the army of Metz, already on the march, by Verdun and Rheims. And the rings of the iron belt had come together, had closed off Paris, and Paris now, separated from the world, was no more than the giant prison of two million living people, from which only dead silence came. .","Henriette finished reading the letter, which ended by mentioning the approach of the Germans. On the 13th, the very day when a delegation from the Government of National Defence established itself in Tours, they had been sighted east of Paris, as far forward as Lagny. On the 14th and 15th they were on the outskirts, at Créteil and Joinville-le-Pont. Yet on the morning of the 18th, when he had written, Maurice still did not seem to believe it would be possible to invest Paris completely, and had recovered a superb confidence, considering a siege as an insolent and hazardous gamble which would collapse in less than three weeks, and counting on the relieving armies the provinces would certainly send, to say nothing of the army of Metz, already on the move via Verdun and Rheims. Thus the links in the iron belt had closed up and shut Paris in a gigantic prison for two million living souls, whence nothing came out but the silence of death.","Henriette finished the letter, which concluded with a mention of the approach of the German armies. On the 13th, the day when a committee of the Government of National Defense had established its quarters at Tours, their advanced guards had been seen at Lagny, to the east of Paris. On the 14th and 15th they were at the very gates of the city, at Creteil and Joinville-le-Pont. On the 18th, however, the day when Maurice wrote, he seemed to have ceased to believe in the possibility of maintaining a strict blockade of Paris; he appeared to be under the influence of one of his hot fits of blind confidence, characterising the siege as a senseless and impudent enterprise that would come to an ignominious end before they were three weeks older, relying on the armies that the provinces would surely send to their relief, to say nothing of the army of Metz, that was already advancing by way of Verdun and Rheims. And the links of the iron chain that their enemies had forged for them had been riveted together; it encompassed Paris, and now Paris was a city shut off from all the world, whence no letter, no word of tidings longer came, the huge prison-house of two millions of living beings, who were to their neighbors as if they were not. Henriette was oppressed by a sense of melancholy."
"Depuis l’échec de Champigny, il n’y avait plus eu qu’une nouvelle tentative malheureuse, du côté du Bourget ; et, le soir où, sous le feu des grosses pièces battant les forts, le plateau d’Avron dut être évacué, Maurice partagea l’irritation dont la violence gagna toute la ville. Le souffle d’impopularité croissante qui menaçait d’emporter le général Trochu et le gouvernement de la Défense nationale, en fut accru, au point de les forcer à tenter un suprême et inutile effort. Pourquoi refusaient-ils de mener au feu les trois cent mille gardes nationaux, qui ne cessaient de s’offrir, de réclamer leur part au danger ? C’était la sortie torrentielle qu’on exigeait depuis le premier jour, Paris rompant ses digues, noyant les Prussiens sous le flot colossal de son peuple. Il fallut bien céder à ce vœu de bravoure, malgré la certitude d’une nouvelle défaite ; mais, pour restreindre le massacre, on se contenta d’employer, avec l’armée active, les cinquante-neuf bataillons de la garde nationale mobilisée. Et, la veille du 19 janvier, ce fut comme une fête : une foule énorme, sur les boulevards et dans les Champs-Élysées, regarda défiler les régiments, qui, musique en tête, chantaient des chants patriotiques. Des enfants, des femmes les accompagnaient, des hommes montaient sur les bancs pour leur crier des souhaits enflammés de victoire. Puis, le lendemain, la population entière se porta vers l’Arc de triomphe, une folie d’espoir l’envahit, lorsque, le matin, arriva la nouvelle de l’occupation de Montretout. Des récits épiques couraient sur l’élan irrésistible de la garde nationale, les Prussiens étaient culbutés, Versailles allait être pris avant le soir. Aussi quel effondrement, à la nuit tombante, quand l’échec inévitable fut connu ! Tandis que la colonne de gauche occupait Montretout, celle du centre, qui avait franchi le mur du parc de Buzenval, se brisait contre un second mur intérieur. Le dégel était venu, une petite pluie persistante avait détrempé les routes, et les canons, ces canons fondus à l’aide de souscriptions, dans lesquels Paris avait mis de son âme, ne purent arriver. À droite, la colonne du général Ducrot, engagée trop tard, restait en arrière. On était au bout de l’effort, le général Trochu dut donner l’ordre d’une retraite générale. On abandonna Montretout, on abandonna Saint-Cloud, que les Prussiens incendièrent. Et, dès que la nuit fut noire, il n’y eut plus, à l’horizon de Paris, que cet incendie immense.","Since the failure of Champigny, there had only been one new unsuccessful attempt, near Le Bourget; and on the evening when, under the fire of the heavy guns beating the forts, the Plateau d'Avron had to be evacuated, Maurice shared the irritation, the violence of which spread throughout the town. The breath of growing unpopularity which threatened to carry off General Trochu and the Government of National Defense was increased to the point of forcing them to attempt a supreme and useless effort. Why did they refuse to lead the three hundred thousand National Guards into the fire, who never ceased to offer themselves, to claim their share in the danger? It was the torrential outburst that had been demanded from the first day, Paris bursting its dykes, drowning the Prussians under the colossal flood of its people. It was necessary to yield to this vow of bravery, despite the certainty of a new defeat; but, to restrain the massacre, they contented themselves with employing, with the active army, the fifty-nine battalions of the mobilized National Guard. And, on the eve of January 19, it was like a party: an enormous crowd, on the boulevards and in the Champs-Élysées, watched the regiments parade, which, with music in the lead, sang patriotic songs. Children, women accompanied them, men mounted the benches to shout fiery wishes of victory. Then, the next day, the entire population went to the Arc de Triomphe, a madness of hope invaded them, when, in the morning, the news of the occupation of Montretout arrived. Epic tales circulated of the irresistible dash of the National Guard, the Prussians were overthrown, Versailles was about to be taken before evening. So what a collapse, at nightfall, when the inevitable failure was known! While the column on the left occupied Montretout, that in the centre, which had crossed the wall of the park of Buzenval, broke against a second interior wall. The thaw had come, a persistent little rain had soaked the roads, and the cannons, these cannons melted down with the help of subscriptions, into which Paris had put its soul, could not arrive. On the right, General Ducrot's column, engaged too late, remained in the rear. We were at the end of the effort, General Trochu had to give the order for a general retreat. They abandoned Montretout, they abandoned Saint-Cloud, which the Prussians set on fire. And, as soon as the night was dark, there was nothing left, on the horizon of Paris, but this immense fire.","Since the failure at Champigny there had been only one more unfortunate attempt, in the direction of Le Bourget, and on the evening when the plateau of Avron had to be evacuated under heavy artillery fire directed at the forts, Maurice shared the growing and violent irritation that possessed the whole city. The tide of unpopularity threatening to bring down Trochu and the Government of National Defence reached such a height that they were forced to make one supreme but unavailing effort. Why were they refusing to lead into the holocaust the three hundred thousand National Guards who were continually offering themselves and clamouring for their share in the danger? This was to be the torrential sortie everybody had been demanding since the first day, Paris bursting its dams and drowning the Prussians in the colossal flood of its people. The authorities were obliged to yield to this need for bravado, although a fresh defeat was inevitable, but in effect, to keep the massacre within limits, they only used the fifty-nine battalions of the National Guard already mobilized in addition to the regular army. The day before 19 January was like a public holiday: a vast crowd on the boulevards and in the Champs Elysées watched the regiments go by, led by bands and singing patriotic songs. Women and children marched along with them, men stood on seats and shouted emotional good wishes for victory. And then on the next day the whole population made for the Arc de Triomphe and was filled with wild hopes when the news of the occupation of Montretout came in during the morning. Epic stories were bandied about concerning the irresistible impetus of the National Guard, the Prussians were hurled back, Versailles would be taken before nightfall. And so what utter despair when evening came and the inevitable failure was known! While the left wing was occupying Montretout, the centre, which had got past the wall of Buzenval park, broke against a second inner wall. The thaw had set in and a persistent drizzle had turned the roads into slush and the guns, those guns cast with the help of public subscriptions, into which Paris had put its very soul, could not be moved up. On the right General Ducrot’s column began moving too late and remained too far in the rear. That was the end of the effort, and General Trochu had to give the order for a general retreat. Montretout was abandoned, Saint-Cloud was abandoned and the Prussians set fire to it. By the time it was dark the horizon of Paris was a sheet of flame.","Since the reverse of Champigny there had been but one other attempt, ending in disaster like the rest, in the direction of Bourget; and the evening when the plateau of Avron was evacuated, under the fire of the heavy siege artillery battering away at the forts, Maurice was a sharer in the rage and exasperation that possessed the entire city. The growing unpopularity that threatened to hurl from power General Trochu and the Government of National Defense was so augmented by this additional repulse that they were compelled to attempt a supreme and hopeless effort. What, did they refuse the services of the three hundred thousand National Guards, who from the beginning had been demanding their share in the peril and in the victory! This time it was to be the torrential sortie that had all along been the object of the popular clamor; Paris was to throw open its dikes and drown the Prussians beneath the on-pouring waves of its children. Notwithstanding the certainty of a fresh defeat, there was no way of avoiding a demand that had its origin in such patriotic motives; but in order to limit the slaughter as far as possible, the chiefs determined to employ, in connection with the regular army, only the fifty-nine mobilized battalions of the National Guard. The day preceding the 19th of January resembled some great public holiday; an immense crowd gathered on the boulevards and in the Champs-Elysees to witness the departing regiments, which marched proudly by, preceded by their bands, the men thundering out patriotic airs. Women and children followed them along the sidewalk, men climbed on the benches to wish them Godspeed. The next morning the entire population of the city hurried out to the Arc de Triomphe, and it was almost frantic with delight when at an early hour news came of the capture of Montretout; the tales that were told of the gallant behavior of the National Guard sounded like epics; the Prussians had been beaten all along the line, the French would occupy Versailles before night. As a natural result the consternation was proportionately great when, at nightfall, the inevitable defeat became known. While the left wing was seizing Montretout the center, which had succeeded in carrying the outer wall of Buzanval Park, had encountered a second inner wall, before which it broke. A thaw had set in, the roads were heavy from the effects of a fine, drizzling rain, and the guns, those guns that had been cast by popular subscription and were to the Parisians as the apple of their eye, could not get up. On the right General Ducrot's column was tardy in getting into action and saw nothing of the fight. Further effort was useless, and General Trochu was compelled to order a retreat. Montretout was abandoned, and Saint-Cloud as well, which the Prussians burned, and when it became fully dark the horizon of Paris was illuminated by the conflagration."
"Dans l’exaltation de cette lutte suprême, il y avait deux grands jours que Maurice n’avait pas songé à Jean. Et Jean non plus, depuis qu’il était entré dans Paris avec son régiment, dont on avait renforcé la division Bruat, ne s’était pas, une seule minute, souvenu de Maurice. La veille, il avait fait le coup de feu au Champ de Mars et sur l’esplanade des Invalides. Puis, ce jour-là, il n’avait quitté la place du Palais-Bourbon que vers midi, pour enlever les barricades du quartier, jusqu’à la rue des Saints-Pères. Lui, si calme, s’était peu à peu exaspéré, dans cette guerre fratricide, au milieu de camarades dont l’ardent désir était de se reposer enfin, après tant de mois de fatigue. Les prisonniers, qu’on ramenait d’Allemagne et qu’on incorporait, ne dérageaient pas contre Paris ; et il y avait encore les récits des abominations de la Commune, qui le jetaient hors de lui, en blessant son respect de la propriété et son besoin d’ordre. Il était resté le fond même de la nation, le paysan sage, désireux de paix, pour qu’on recommençât à travailler, à gagner, à se refaire du sang. Mais surtout, dans cette colère grandissante, qui emportait jusqu’à ses plus tendres préoccupations, les incendies étaient venus l’affoler. Brûler les maisons, brûler les palais, parce qu’on n’était pas les plus forts, ah çà, non, par exemple ! Il n’y avait que des bandits capables d’un coup pareil. Et lui dont les exécutions sommaires, la veille, avaient serré le cœur, ne s’appartenait plus, farouche, les yeux hors de la tête, tapant, hurlant.","In the excitement of this supreme struggle, Maurice had not thought of Jean for two great days. Nor had Jean, since he had entered Paris with his regiment, whose division Bruat had been reinforced, had not remembered Maurice for a single minute. The day before, he had fired the shot at the Champ de Mars and on the Esplanade des Invalides. Then, that day, he had only left the Place du Palais-Bourbon around noon, to clear the barricades in the neighborhood, as far as the Rue des Saints-Pères. He, so calm, had gradually become exasperated, in this fratricidal war, in the midst of comrades whose ardent desire was to finally rest after so many months of fatigue. The prisoners, who were brought back from Germany and incorporated, did not rage against Paris; and there were still the tales of the abominations of the Commune, which drove him mad, wounding his respect for property and his need for order. He had remained the very basis of the nation, the wise peasant, desirous of peace, so that we could begin to work again, to earn, to replenish our blood. But above all, in this growing anger, which carried away even his most tender preoccupations, the fires had come to panic him. Burning the houses, burning the palaces, because we weren't the strongest, ah, no, for example! There were only bandits capable of such a blow. And he, whose summary executions the day before had wrung his heart, no longer belonged to himself, fierce, his eyes bulging out of his head, beating, screaming.","In the excitement of this decisive struggle Maurice had not thought of Jean for two whole days. Similarly Jean, since he had entered Paris with his regiment to reinforce the Bruat division, had never remembered Maurice for a single moment. On the previous day he had been fighting on the Champ de Mars and on the Esplanade des Invalides. But today he had only left the Place du Palais-Bourbon at about noon to storm the barricades in that part of Paris as far as the rue des Saints-Pères. Placid though he was by nature, he had grown more and more angry in this fratricidal war, surrounded by comrades whose one great desire was to have a rest at last after so many months of fatigue. Prisoners sent back from Germany to be put into the army were in a constant state of fury with Paris, and on top of that there were the reports of the foul crimes of the Commune which incensed him by outraging his respect for property and desire for order. He had remained typical of the very heart of the nation, the sensible peasant, longing for peace so as to get back to work, earn some money and recover health and strength. In this increasing anger, which carried away even his most tender feelings, it was the fires more than anything else which had infuriated him. Burn down houses and public buildings just because you weren’t the strongest, no, that really was the end! Only criminals could be capable of such a thing. This man, whose heart had been sickened only the day before by the summary executions, was now beside himself, wild-eyed, yelling and laying about him.","For two whole days, in the fevered excitement of the supreme conflict, Maurice had not once thought of Jean, nor had Jean, since he entered Paris with his regiment, which had been assigned to Bruat's division, for a single moment remembered Maurice. The day before his duties had kept him in the neighborhood of the Champ de Mars and the Esplanade of the Invalides, and on this day he had remained in the Place du Palais-Bourbon until nearly noon, when the troops were sent forward to clean out the barricades of the quartier, as far as the Rue des Saints-Peres. A feeling of deep exasperation against the rioters had gradually taken possession of him, usually so calm and self-contained, as it had of all his comrades, whose ardent wish it was to be allowed to go home and rest after so many months of fatigue. But of all the atrocities of the Commune that stirred his placid nature and made him forgetful even of his tenderest affections, there were none that angered him as did those conflagrations. What, burn houses, set fire to palaces, and simply because they had lost the battle! Only robbers and murderers were capable of such work as that. And he who but the day before had sorrowed over the summary executions of the insurgents was now like a madman, ready to rend and tear, yelling, shouting, his eyes starting from their sockets."
"Du coup, le père Fouchard se leva, soulagé, criant à pleine voix :","Suddenly Father Fouchard got up, relieved, shouting at the top of his voice:","Old Fouchard jumped up at once, very relieved, and shouted at the top of his voice:",Old Fouchard felt as if a great load had been taken off his mind; he went to the door and shouted at the top of his voice:
– Ce n’est pas Dieu possible ! la rivière va prendre feu.,- It is not possible God! the river will catch fire.,"‘Oh God, it isn’t possible! The river itself will catch fire.’",“Did ever mortal man look on the like of this! the very river is on fire.”
"Ce fut encore le docteur Dalichamp qui offrit de le conduire à Bouillon, dans son cabriolet. Il était d’un courage, d’une bonté inépuisables. À Raucourt, que ravageait le typhus, apporté par les Bavarois, il avait des malades dans toutes les maisons, en dehors des deux ambulances qu’il visitait, celle de Raucourt même et celle de Remilly. Son ardent patriotisme, son besoin de protester contre les inutiles violences, l’avaient deux fois fait arrêter, puis relâcher par les Prussiens. Aussi riait-il d’un bon rire, le matin où il arriva avec sa voiture, pour prendre Jean, heureux de faire échapper un autre de ces vaincus de Sedan, tout ce pauvre et brave monde, comme il disait, qu’il soignait, qu’il aidait de sa bourse. Jean, qui souffrait de la question d’argent, sachant Henriette pauvre, avait accepté les cinquante francs que le docteur lui offrait pour son voyage.","It was again Doctor Dalichamp who offered to take him to Bouillon in his cabriolet. He was of inexhaustible courage and kindness. At Raucourt, which was ravaged by typhus, brought by the Bavarians, he had sick people in all the houses, apart from the two ambulances he visited, that of Raucourt itself and that of Remilly. His ardent patriotism, his need to protest against useless violence, had twice caused him to be arrested and then released by the Prussians. So he laughed a good laugh the morning he arrived with his carriage to pick up Jean, happy to help another of those vanquished from Sedan escape, all those poor and brave people, as he said, whom he was taking care of. , whom he helped out of his purse. Jean, who suffered from the question of money, knowing Henriette to be poor, had accepted the fifty francs which the doctor offered him for his journey.","And again it was Dr Dalichamp who offered to take him to Bouillon in his trap. His courage and kindness were inexhaustible. In Raucourt, which was ravaged by typhus brought by the Bavarians, he had patients in all the houses in addition to the two hospitals he visited, the Raucourt one itself and the one at Remilly. His burning patriotism and urge to protest against pointless violence had caused him to be arrested twice and then released by the Prussians. And so he was in a carefree laughing mood on the morning when he came for Jean with his trap, glad to be helping another Sedan victim to escape, one of these poor brave people, as he called those whom he looked after and helped out of his own pocket. Jean, who was embarrassed about money and knew how poor Henriette was, had accepted the fifty francs the doctor gave him for his journey.","It was Dr. Dalichamp again in this instance who offered the services of his gig and himself as driver to Bouillon. The good man's courage and kindness were boundless. At Raucourt, where typhus was raging, communicated by the Bavarians, there was not a house where he had not one or more patients, and this labor was additional to his regular attendance at the two hospitals at Raucourt and Remilly. His ardent patriotism, the impulse that prompted him to protest against unnecessary barbarity, had twice led to his being arrested by the Prussians, only to be released on each occasion. He gave a little laugh of satisfaction, therefore, the morning he came with his vehicle to take up Jean, pleased to be the instrument of assisting the escape of another of the victims of Sedan, those poor, brave fellows, as he called them, to whom he gave his professional services and whom he aided with his purse. Jean, who knew of Henriette's straitened circumstances and had been suffering from lack of funds since his relapse, accepted gratefully the fifty francs that the doctor offered him for traveling expenses."
"Puis, comme Henriette répétait sa question :","Then, as Henriette repeated her question:",Then as Henriette repeated her question:,"Then, in reply to Henriette's reiterated question: “"
"– Qui, toi ?",- Who you ?,Who’s me?’,"“Who, I?”"
"C’était vrai, une telle excitation nerveuse le tenait debout, qu’il était comme soulevé de terre. Dire que, de toute la campagne, il n’avait pas encore brûlé une cartouche ! Il était allé à la frontière, il avait passé devant Mulhouse la terrible nuit d’angoisse, sans voir un Prussien, sans lâcher un coup de fusil ; et il avait dû battre en retraite jusqu’à Belfort, jusqu’à Reims, et de nouveau il marchait à l’ennemi depuis cinq jours, son chassepot toujours vierge, inutile. Un besoin grandissant, une rage lente le prenait d’épauler, de tirer au moins, pour soulager ses nerfs. Depuis six semaines bientôt qu’il s’était engagé, dans une crise d’enthousiasme, rêvant de combat pour le lendemain, il n’avait fait qu’user ses pauvres pieds d’homme délicat à fuir et à piétiner, loin des champs de bataille. Aussi, dans l’attente fébrile de tous, était-il un de ceux qui interrogeaient avec le plus d’impatience cette route de Grand-Pré, filant toute droite, à l’infini, entre de beaux arbres. Au-dessous de lui, la vallée se déroulait, l’Aisne mettait comme un ruban d’argent parmi les saules et les peupliers ; et ses regards revenaient invinciblement à la route, là-bas.","It was true, such nervous excitement kept him upright, he was as if lifted from the ground. To think that, in the whole campaign, he had not yet burned a cartridge! He had gone to the frontier, he had passed the terrible night of anguish before Mulhouse, without seeing a Prussian, without firing a shot; and he had had to beat a retreat as far as Belfort, as far as Reims, and again he had been marching against the enemy for five days, his Chassepot still virgin, useless. A growing need, a slow rage seized him to support, to shoot at least, to relieve his nerves. For almost six weeks since he had been engaged, in a fit of enthusiasm, dreaming of a fight for the next day, he had only worn out his poor feet of a delicate man in fleeing and trampling, far from the fields. of battle. Also, in the feverish expectation of all, he was one of those who questioned with the most impatience this road to Grand-Pré, spinning straight, to infinity, between beautiful trees. Below him the valley unrolled, the Aisne laying like a silver ribbon among the willows and poplars; and his eyes returned invincibly to the road, over there.","It was true. He was upheld by such nervous excitement that he felt as if he were not touching the ground. To think that all through the campaign he hadn’t yet fired a single round. He had been to the frontier, he had spent the awful night of suspense outside Mulhouse, without setting eyes on a single Prussian or firing a shot, and he had had to retreat to Belfort, to Rheims, and once again he had been marching towards the enemy for five days with his rifle still virgin and useless. He was possessed by a growing need, a dull rage urging him to take aim and fire anyway, to steady his nerves. It was nearly six weeks since he had joined up in a burst of enthusiasm, dreaming of battle the next day, and all he had done was wear out his poor, delicate, civilian feet running away or marking time, miles from any battlefield. That was why, in this universal mood of expectation, he was one of the most impatient watchers of that main road to Grand-Pré stretching away dead straight between its fine trees. Beneath him the valley wound along, the Aisne making a kind of silver ribbon amid the willows and poplars, but his eyes could not help coming back to that road down there.","It was true; his nervous excitement was so great that he was hardly conscious of the ground on which he trod. To think that in the whole campaign he had not yet burned powder! He had gone forth to the frontier, he had endured the agony of that terrible night of expectation before Mulhausen, and had not seen a Prussian, had not fired a shot; then he had retreated with the rest to Belfort, to Rheims, had now been marching five days trying to find the enemy, and his useless chassepot was as clean as the day it left the shop, without the least smell of smoke on it. He felt an aching desire to discharge his piece once, if no more, to relieve the tension of his nerves. Since the day, near six weeks ago, when he had enlisted in a fit of enthusiasm, supposing that he would surely have to face the foe in a day or two, all that he had done had been to tramp up and down the country on his poor, sore feet—the feet of a man who had lived in luxury, far from the battle-field; and so, among all those impatient watchers, there was none who watched more impatiently than he the Grand-Pre road, extending straight away to a seemingly infinite distance between two rows of handsome trees. Beneath him was unrolled the panorama of the valley; the Aisne was, like a silver ribbon, flowing between its willows and poplars, and ever his gaze returned, solicited by an irresistible attraction, to that road down yonder that stretched away, far as the eye could see, to the horizon."
"Et il lui passa un quartier de pain et une gamelle, où il y avait une cuisse de l’oie, sur six grosses pommes de terre.","And he passed her a slice of bread and a bowl, in which was a leg of the goose, on six large potatoes.",And he slipped him half a loaf of bread and a messtin in which he put a thigh of the goose sitting on six large potatoes.,And he handed him half a loaf of bread and a wooden bowl in which there were a second joint of the bird and six big mealy potatoes.
"Ce fut, au delà du canal, à l’entrée du village de Courcelles, qu’il trouva le déjeuner rêvé. La veille, on lui avait dit que l’empereur était descendu dans une maison bourgeoise de ce village ; et il y était venu flâner par curiosité, il se souvenait d’avoir vu, à l’angle de deux routes, ce cabaret avec sa tonnelle, d’où pendaient de belles grappes de raisin, déjà dorées et mûres. Sous la vigne grimpante, il y avait des tables peintes en vert, tandis que, dans la vaste cuisine, par la porte grande ouverte, on apercevait l’horloge sonore, les images d’Épinal collées parmi les faïences, l’hôtesse énorme activant le tournebroche. Derrière, s’étendait un jeu de boules. Et c’était bon enfant, gai et joli, toute la vieille guinguette française.","It was beyond the canal, at the entrance to the village of Courcelles, that he found his dream lunch. The day before, he had been told that the Emperor had stayed in a bourgeois house in this village; and he had come to stroll there out of curiosity, he remembered having seen, at the corner of two roads, this cabaret with its arbor, from which hung beautiful bunches of grapes, already golden and ripe. Beneath the climbing vine there were tables painted green, while in the vast kitchen, through the wide open door, one could see the sounding clock, the images of Epinal pasted among the earthenware, the enormous hostess activating the turnspit. Behind lay a bowling alley. And it was good-natured, gay and pretty, the whole old French guinguette.","It was past the canal, as you enter the village of Courcelles, that he found the meal of his dreams. He had been told the day before that the Emperor was putting up in one of the grander houses of the village, and he had gone that way for a walk out of curiosity. He remembered noticing this inn on a corner, its arbour hanging with fine bunches of grapes already golden and ripe. Beneath this climbing vine there were some tables painted green, and through the open door could be seen the huge kitchen with its ticking clock, Epinal prints gummed to the walls amidst the crockery, and the massive hostess turning the spit. Behind the inn there was a bowling alley. It was friendly, gay and pretty, the typical old-fashioned French eating-house.","It was just at the entrance of the village of Courcelles, across the canal, that he found the breakfast for which his mouth was watering. He had been told the day before that the Emperor had taken up his quarters in one of the houses of the village, and having gone to stroll there out of curiosity, now remembered to have seen at the junction of the two roads this little inn with its arbor, the trellises of which were loaded with big clusters of ripe, golden, luscious grapes. There was an array of green-painted tables set out in the shade of the luxuriant vine, while through the open door of the vast kitchen he had caught glimpses of the antique clock, the colored prints pasted on the walls, and the comfortable landlady watching the revolving spit. It was cheerful, smiling, hospitable; a regular type of the good old-fashioned French hostelry."

"– Nous avons vu les canons, affirma le Provençal.

"– Les flanquer à la Meuse, oui, sans doute ! murmura Weiss, et leur passer sur le ventre pour reprendre le chemin de Carignan, ce serait très bien !","“To throw them into the Meuse, yes, no doubt! murmured Weiss, and going over their stomachs to take the road back to Carignan would be very good!","‘Chuck them into the Meuse, yes, no doubt,’ murmured Weiss, ‘and walk over their bodies to get back on to the Carignan road, very nice too!’","“Oh, of course! drive them into the Meuse, by all means,” muttered Weiss, “and while we are about it we might as well ride them down and regain possession of the Carignan road.”"

"Depuis un instant, les tirailleurs ennemis semblaient s’être rapprochés, des balles arrivaient, avec un bruit mat, dans les briques de la teinturerie ; et, abrités derrière le petit mur de la cour, les soldats maintenant ripostaient.

"En effet, des poings tapaient à la porte de la cuisine, et Prosper, ennuyé d’être seul, hésitait, parlementait. Quand le maître n’était pas là, il n’aimait guère ouvrir, par crainte des dégâts dont on l’aurait rendu responsable. Mais il eut la chance que, justement, à cette minute, la carriole du père Fouchard dévala par la route en pente, avec le trot assourdi du cheval dans la neige. Et ce fut le vieux qui reçut les hommes.","In fact, fists were banging on the kitchen door, and Prosper, annoyed at being alone, hesitated and argued. When the master was not there, he did not like to open, for fear of the damage for which he would have been held responsible.

And it was the old man who received the men.","By now fists were banging on the kitchen door and Prosper, worried because he was on his own, was gaining time by arguing. When the master was not at home he was not keen on opening the door for fear of damage for which he would be held responsible.

So it was the old man who let them in.","A loud knocking was heard at the kitchen door and Prosper, who was beginning to tire of his solitude, was holding a hesitating parley with the visitors. He did not like to admit strangers when the master was away, fearing he might be held responsible for any damage that might ensue.

"Puis, brusquement, comme on faisait halte, au bord de la route, le canon tonna, vers la droite. Les coups étaient si nets, si profonds, que le combat ne devait pas être à plus de deux lieues. Sur ces hommes las de se replier, énervés par l’attente, l’effet fut extraordinaire. Tous, debout, frémissaient, oubliant leur fatigue : pourquoi ne marchait-on pas ? ils voulaient se battre, se faire casser la tête, plutôt que de continuer à fuir ainsi à la débandade, sans savoir où, ni pourquoi.","Then, suddenly, as we halted by the side of the road, the cannon thundered to the right. The blows were so clean, so deep, that the fight couldn't have been more than two leagues away. On these men weary of retreating, enervated by waiting, the effect was extraordinary.

The firing was so clear and loud that the battle could not be more than two leagues away. The effect on these men, so weary of retreating and sick of waiting about, was extraordinary. They all leaped to their feet, full of excitement, forgetting their fatigue: why weren’t they marching? They wanted to fight, to be killed rather than go on running away helter-skelter like this, and without knowing where or why.","Soon after that, just as the men had been halted for a short rest along the roadside, the roar of artillery was heard away at their right; judging from the distinctness of the detonations the firing could not be more than two leagues distant. Upon the troops, weary with waiting, tired of retreating, the effect was magical; in the twinkling of an eye everyone was on his feet, eager, in a quiver of excitement, no longer mindful of his hunger and fatigue: why did they not advance? They preferred to fight, to die, rather than keep on flying thus, no one knew why or whither."

"D’un regard, là-bas, vers le bois impénétrable, tous deux disaient leur colère contre le bandit qui galopait, libre maintenant ; tandis qu’ils finissaient par se sentir pleins de pitié pour le pauvre diable, sa victime, un fricoteur qui ne valait sûrement pas cher, mais tout de même un garçon gai, débrouillard et pas bête. Voilà comment il se faisait que, si malin qu’on fût, on se laissait tout de même manger un jour !","With a glance, over there, towards the impenetrable wood, both expressed their anger against the bandit who galloped, free now; while they ended by feeling full of pity for the poor devil, his victim, a fricotor who was certainly not worth much, but all the same a gay boy, resourceful and not stupid. That's how it happened that, however clever we were, we still let ourselves be eaten one day!","The look they both cast at the impenetrable wood expressed their loathing of the criminal now running away in freedom, while in the end they felt full of pity for his victim, poor devil, who was a slippery customer and not much cop to be sure, but all the same a lively chap, resourceful and no fool. So however clever you were you got your packet sometime!","The two friends cast a look in the direction of the wood that sufficiently expressed their sentiments toward the scoundrel who had gained his freedom by such base means, while their hearts were stirred with feelings of deepest compassion for the poor devil whom he had made his victim, a guzzler and a toper, who certainly did not amount to much, but a merry, good-natured fellow all the same, and nobody's fool. And that was always the way with those who kept bad company, Jean moralizingly observed: they might be very fly, but sooner or later a bigger rascal was sure to come along and make a meal of them."
"Puis, brave homme au fond :","Then, good man in the background:",Then his real kindness came out:,"Then, dropping public for private matters, the kind-hearted man said: “Look here, my young friend, I am going to see what I can do for that foot of yours; then we'll give you some dinner and put you to bed in my apprentice's little room, who has cleared out.”"
"Lorsque Maurice et Henriette, que suivaient les autres, eurent tourné à gauche, puis à droite, entre deux interminables murailles, ils débouchèrent tout d’un coup devant la porte grande ouverte de l’Ermitage.

"D’un bond, Rochas, revenu sur ses pas, prit le drapeau, dont la hampe s’était brisée ; tandis que le sous-lieutenant murmurait, les mots empâtés d’une écume sanglante :","With a bound, Rochas, retracing his steps, took the flag, the staff of which had broken; while the second lieutenant murmured, the words thickened with bloody foam:","Rochas leaped back in one bound, took the flag, the staff of which had been broken, while the second lieutenant murmured in a voice choking with bloody foam:","Rochas turned and in a single bound was at his side.

"Telle était la crainte de la foule.

Même il revenait parfois le soir, s’attardait davantage ; et il était ainsi le seul lien avec le monde, ce vaste monde du dehors, si bouleversé de catastrophes. Les nouvelles n’entraient que par lui, il avait un cœur ardent de patriote qui débordait de colère et de chagrin, à chaque défaite. Aussi ne parlait-il guère que de la marche envahissante des Prussiens, dont le flot, depuis Sedan, s’étendait peu à peu sur toute la France, comme une marée noire. Chaque jour apportait son deuil, et il restait accablé sur l’une des deux chaises, contre le lit, il disait la situation de plus en plus grave, avec des gestes tremblants. Souvent, il avait les poches bourrées de journaux belges, qu’il laissait. À des semaines de distance, l’écho de chaque désastre arrivait ainsi au fond de cette chambre perdue, rapprochant encore, dans une commune angoisse, les deux pauvres êtres souffrants qui s’y trouvaient renfermés.","In the morning, when Doctor Dalichamp had bandaged the wounded man, he liked to forget himself there, for a few minutes. He even came back sometimes in the evening, lingered longer; and he was thus the only link with the world, that vast world outside, so convulsed with catastrophes. News only came through him, he had a fiery patriotic heart that overflowed with anger and grief at every defeat. So he hardly spoke of anything but the invading march of the Prussians, whose flood, from Sedan, spread little by little over the whole of France, like an oil slick. Every day brought his mourning, and he remained overwhelmed on one of the two chairs, against the bed, he told of the increasingly serious situation, with trembling gestures. Often his pockets were stuffed with Belgian newspapers, which he left behind. Weeks apart, the echo of each disaster thus reached the depths of this lost room, bringing still closer, in a common anguish, the two poor suffering beings who were shut up there.","In the mornings Dr Dalichamp, having dressed the wound, liked to linger there for a few minutes. He even came back sometimes in the evening and stayed longer, and thus he was the only link with the world, the great world outside, so convulsed by disasters. News only reached them through him, and his ardent patriotic heart boiled over with anger and grief at every defeat. So he hardly talked about anything except the invading march of the Prussians who since Sedan had been flooding steadily all over France, like a black host. Each day brought its own grief, and he would stay there lost in misery, slumped on one of the two chairs beside the bed, and, waving his trembling hands, tell of an ever worsening situation. Often his pockets were stuffed with Belgian newspapers which he left behind. Thus, weeks after the event, the echo of each disaster reached this hidden room and drew still closer, in a common bond of anguish, the two poor suffering souls shut in there.","In the morning, after Doctor Dalichamp had attended to his patient, he liked to sit a while and chat, putting his cares aside for the moment. Sometimes he also returned at evening and made a longer visit, and it was in this way that they learned what was going on in the great world outside their peaceful solitude and the terrible calamities that were desolating their country. He was their only source of intelligence; his heart, which beat with patriotic ardor, overflowed with rage and grief at every fresh defeat, and thus it was that his sole topic of conversation was the victorious progress of the Prussians, who, since Sedan, had spread themselves over France like the waves of some black ocean. Each day brought its own tidings of disaster, and resting disconsolately on one of the two chairs that stood by the bedside, he would tell in mournful tones and with trembling gestures of the increasing gravity of the situation. Oftentimes he came with his pockets stuffed with Belgian newspapers, which he would leave behind him when he went away. And thus the echoes of defeat, days, weeks, after the event, reverberated in that quiet room, serving to unite yet more closely in community of sorrow the two poor sufferers who were shut within its walls."
"Une colère l’envahit, lui si calme. Il serrait les poings, il se serait battu.","Anger came over him, he was so calm. He clenched his fists, he would have fought.",Normally so placid he began to fly into a rage. He clenched his fists and could have hit himself.,"He gave way to a fit of rage, he, always so self-contained. He clenched his fists, could have thumped himself."
"– Ah, tant pis ! c’est trop bête !","- Oh, too bad! it's too stupid !","‘Oh, what the hell! It’s too ridiculous!’","“Very well, so much the worse for her; it was too idiotic.”"
"Sa mère, follement, le prit dans ses bras, l’assit sur ses genoux. Ah ! le pauvre être, sa joie et son désespoir, qu’elle aimait de toute son âme et qu’elle ne pouvait regarder sans pleurer, ce fils de sa chair qu’elle souffrait d’entendre appeler méchamment le Prussien par les gamins de son âge, lorsqu’ils jouaient avec lui sur la route ! Elle le baisa, comme pour lui rentrer les paroles dans la bouche.","His mother, madly, took him in her arms, sitting him on her lap. Ah! the poor being, her joy and her despair, whom she loved with all her soul and whom she could not look at without crying, this son of her flesh whom she suffered from hearing maliciously called the Prussian by the kids of her age , when they played with him on the road! She kissed him, as if to force the words into his mouth.","His mother snatched him up in her arms and sat him on her lap. Poor little thing, her joy and her despair, whom she loved with all her soul but could never look at without crying, this child of her body it hurt so much to hear maliciously being called the Prussian by the kids of his age when they played with him in the street. She kissed him as though to force the words back into his mouth.","His mother went and caught him frantically in her arms and seated him on her lap. Ah! the poor little waif, at once her delight and her despair, whom she loved with all her soul and who brought the tears to her eyes every time she looked on him, flesh of her flesh, whom it wrung her heart to hear the urchins with whom he consorted in the street tauntingly call “the little Prussian!” She kissed him, as if she would have forced the words back into his mouth."
"Et il s’élança, il voulut le prendre à la gorge. Mais le paysan, s’imaginant qu’on allait de nouveau mettre sa maison à sac, sauta en arrière, se barricada. Il y eut un moment de confusion, tous les soldats présents se ruaient, pendant que le maréchal des logis, furieux, s’étranglait à crier :","And he rushed forward, he wanted to take him by the throat. But the peasant, imagining that his house was going to be ransacked again, jumped back and barricaded himself. There was a moment of confusion, all the soldiers present rushed, while the sergeant, furious, choked to cry:","He leaped up and made as if to fly at his throat. But the farmer, thinking his house was going to be sacked once again, jumped back and locked the door. There was a moment of scrimmage and all the soldiers rushed up as the furious sergeant shouted himself hoarse:","And he darted forward and would have caught him by the throat, but the peasant, foreseeing in his action a repetition of his yesterday's experience, jumped quickly within the house and locked the door behind him. For a moment confusion reigned about the premises; soldiers came rushing up to see what was going on, while the quartermaster-sergeant shouted at the top of his voice:"
"Dès lors, la vue de ce capitaine, de cette méprisante figure à gifles, lui devint insupportable. D’ailleurs, on entrait dans Sedan, on passait sur le pont de Meuse ; et les scènes de brutalité se renouvelaient, se multipliaient. Une femme, une mère sans doute, qui voulait embrasser un sergent tout jeune, venait d’être écartée d’un coup de crosse, si violemment, qu’elle en était tombée à terre. Sur la place Turenne, ce furent des bourgeois qu’on bouscula, parce qu’ils jetaient des provisions aux prisonniers. Dans la Grande-Rue, un de ceux-ci, ayant glissé en prenant une bouteille qu’une dame lui offrait, fut relevé à coups de botte. Sedan, qui depuis huit jours voyait ainsi passer ce misérable bétail de la défaite, conduit au bâton, ne s’y accoutumait pas, était agité, à chaque défilé nouveau, d’une fièvre sourde de pitié et de révolte.","From then on, the sight of this captain, of this contemptuous slapped face, became unbearable to him. Besides, you entered Sedan, you crossed the Pont de Meuse; and the scenes of brutality were renewed, multiplied. A woman, a mother no doubt, who wanted to kiss a very young sergeant, had just been pushed aside with a blow from the rifle butt, so violently that she had fallen to the ground. On the Place Turenne, it was the bourgeois who were jostled, because they were throwing provisions to the prisoners. In the Grande-Rue, one of them, having slipped while taking a bottle which a lady was offering him, was kicked back up. Sedan, which for a week had seen these wretched cattle of defeat thus pass, led to the stick, was not accustomed to it, was agitated, at each new defile, by a dull fever of pity and revolt.","After that he couldn’t bear the sight of this captain, with his supercilious face that cried out to be hit. Now that they were entering Sedan proper over the Meuse bridge, the scenes of brutality recurred, and there were more of them. A woman, probably a mother, wanted to kiss a young sergeant and was pushed away so violently with a rifle-butt that she fell on the ground. On the Place Turenne the townspeople were rough-handled because they threw food to the prisoners. In the Grande-Rue one of the prisoners slipped down as he was taking a bottle a lady gave him, and was kicked to his feet again. For a whole week now Sedan had been witnessing this human livestock from the defeat being driven along with sticks, but could not get used to it, and with each new lot was moved by a sullen fever of pity and revolt.","And during the remainder of their march he could not endure to look on that captain, with his ugly, supercilious face. They had entered Sedan and were crossing the Pont de Meuse, and the scenes of violence and brutality became more numerous than ever. A woman darted forward and would have embraced a boyish young sergeant — likely she was his mother—and was repulsed with a blow from a musket-butt that felled her to the ground. On the Place Turenne the guards hustled and maltreated some citizens because they cast provisions to the prisoners. In the Grande Rue one of the convoy fell in endeavoring to secure a bottle that a lady extended to him, and was assisted to his feet with kicks. For a week now Sedan had witnessed the saddening spectacle of the defeated driven like cattle through its streets, and seemed no more accustomed to it than at the beginning; each time a fresh detachment passed the city was stirred to its very depths by a movement of pity and indignation."

"Puis, lorsque le jeune homme s’en alla, en la rassurant, elle l’accompagna, se pencha au-dessus de la rampe.","Then, when the young man went away, reassuring her, she went with him, leaning over the banister.","When the young man took his leave, trying to cheer her up, she came with him and leaned over the banister.","And when the young man took leave of her with a few murmured words of comfort she went with him to the door, and leaning over the banister: “Look!”"
"À son tour, il l’interrogea, désireux de savoir ce que le régiment était devenu. Et, comme Jean racontait qu’on venait de voir le colonel traverser la ville, à la tête de ce qu’il lui restait d’hommes, pour aller camper au nord, Gilberte, de nouveau, parla trop vite, avec sa vivacité de jolie femme, qui ne réfléchissait guère.","He in turn questioned him, eager to know what had become of the regiment. And, as Jean was recounting that the colonel had just been seen crossing the town, at the head of what men he had left, to go encamp to the north, Gilberte again spoke too quickly, with her pretty, unthinking woman.","He interrogated Jean in his turn, for he was anxious to know what had happened to the regiment. And as Jean said that the colonel had recently been seen going through the town at the head of his remaining men, on the way to camp to the north, Gilberte once again spoke too quickly with the usual impulsiveness of a pretty young woman not given to much thought.","“He is a corporal in my company,” the captain finally said by way of cutting short the conversation, and inaugurated a series of questions on his own account to learn what had become of the regiment. As Jean went on to tell that the colonel had been seen crossing the city to reach his camp at the head of what few men were left him, Gilberte again thoughtlessly spoke up, with the vivacity of a woman whose beauty is supposed to atone for her indiscretion:"
"– Tu vois, se contenta de murmurer Jean à l’oreille de Maurice.","""You see,"" Jean contented himself with murmuring in Maurice's ear.","‘You see what I mean,’ was all Jean murmured in Maurice’s ear.","“You see,” was all that Jean said to Maurice."
"Mais, en bas, comme il partageait cette provision nouvelle avec le garçon jardinier, un soldat jeta un cri, tomba sur le ventre. Ils n’étaient plus que sept ; et, tout de suite, ils ne furent plus que six, le caporal ayant reçu, dans l’œil gauche, une balle qui lui fit sauter la cervelle.","But down below, as he was sharing this new provision with the gardener's boy, a soldier cried out and fell on his stomach. They were only seven; and immediately there were only six of them, the corporal having received a bullet in the left eye which blew out his brains.","Down below, as he was sharing this new supply with the gardener, a soldier uttered a scream and fell on his face. They were now only seven, and immediately after only six, the corporal getting a bullet through his left eye which blew out his brains.","Downstairs, as he was sharing his newly acquired treasure with the gardener's lad, a soldier uttered a piercing cry and sank to his knees. They were but seven; and presently they were but six, a bullet having entered the corporal's head at the eye and lodged in the brain."
"Puis, ils se ruèrent sur une maison de paysan, cassèrent les portes des armoires, arrachèrent le chaume de la toiture. Des officiers qui arrivaient au pas de course, en les menaçant de leurs revolvers, les mirent en fuite.","Then they rushed on a peasant's house, broke the doors of the cupboards, tore the thatch from the roof. Officers who arrived at a run, threatening them with their revolvers, put them to flight.","Then they made a rush at a peasant’s cottage, broke off cupboard doors and tore the thatch off the roof. Some officers with revolvers dashed up and drove them away.","Then they fell to work on the miserable cabin of a poor peasant, smashing the closet doors, tearing the thatch from the roof. Some officers, who came up on a run, threatened them with their revolvers and put them to flight."
"– Et « Pauvre enfant », comment va-t-il, aujourd’hui ?","– And “Poor child”, how is he today?","‘What about “Poor Kid”, how’s he doing today?’","“And 'Poor boy,' how is he getting on to-day?”"
"Depuis que régnait le silence, en effet, le bruit des détonations semblait grandir. Et elle sauta du lit, elle se fit aider, sans vouloir appeler la femme de chambre, se chaussant, passant tout de suite une robe, pour être prête à recevoir et à descendre, s’il le fallait. Comme elle achevait rapidement de se coiffer, on frappa, et elle courut ouvrir, en reconnaissant la voix de la vieille madame Delaherche.","Since silence had reigned, in fact, the noise of the detonations seemed to increase. And she jumped out of bed, she got help, without wanting to call the maid, put on her shoes, put on a dress right away, to be ready to receive and get off, if necessary. As she was quickly finishing her hair, someone knocked, and she ran to open it, recognizing the voice of old Madame Delaherche.","Since they had been silent the sound of gunfire had indeed seemed louder. She jumped out of bed, got Henriette to help her, not wanting to call her maid, putting on shoes, getting quickly into a dress so as to be ready to receive anybody or go downstairs if necessary. As she was quickly finishing her hair there was a knock, and recognizing old Madame Delaherche ’s voice she ran to open the door.","The reports sounded more distinctly in the silent room now that their conversation had ceased. Leaving her bed, the young woman accepted the assistance of her friend, not caring to summon her maid, and rapidly made her toilet for the day, in order that she might be ready to go downstairs should she be needed there. As she was completing the arrangement of her hair there was a knock at the door, and, recognizing the voice of the elder Madame Delaherche, she hastened to admit her."
"Cette fois, elle resta silencieuse, comme perdue elle-même dans la grande douleur de la défaite. Elle était déjà d’un autre âge, de cette vieille et rude bourgeoisie des frontières, si ardente autrefois à défendre ses villes. Sous la vive clarté de la lampe, son visage sévère, au nez sec, aux lèvres minces, disait sa colère et sa souffrance, toute la révolte qui l’empêchait de dormir.","This time she remained silent, as though lost herself in the great pain of defeat. She was already of another age, of that old and rough bourgeoisie of the frontiers, so ardent in the past to defend her towns. Under the bright light of the lamp, his stern face, with its dry nose and thin lips, spoke of his anger and his suffering, all the revolt which prevented him from sleeping.","This time she made no reply, herself lost in the great grief of the defeat. She belonged to an already bygone age, that of the old, sturdy frontier bourgeoisie, so fierce in former days in defence of its towns. In the strong lamplight her severe face with its thin nose and tight lips expressed her anger and suffering, the feeling of revolt which made sleep impossible for her.","She made him no answer this time, as if all her being, all her faculties were concentrated on contemplating the great calamity of their defeat. She was of another age; she was a survivor of that strong old race of frontier burghers who defended their towns so valiantly in the good days gone by. The clean-cut lines of her stern, set face, with its fleshless, uncompromising nose and thin lips, which the brilliant light of the lamp brought out in high relief against the darkness of the room, told the full extent of her stifled rage and grief and the wound sustained by her antique patriotism, the revolt of which refused even to let her sleep."
"Combien de temps Maurice tira-t-il encore ? Il n’avait plus conscience du temps ni des lieux. Il pouvait être neuf heures, dix heures peut-être. L’exécrable besogne qu’il faisait l’étouffait maintenant d’une nausée, ainsi qu’un vin immonde qui revient dans l’ivresse. Autour de lui, les maisons en flammes commençaient à l’envelopper d’une chaleur insupportable, d’un air brûlant d’asphyxie. Le carrefour, avec ses tas de pavés qui le fermaient, était devenu un camp retranché, défendu par les incendies, sous une pluie de tisons. N’étaient-ce pas les ordres ? incendier les quartiers en abandonnant les barricades, arrêter les troupes par une ligne dévorante de brasiers, brûler Paris à mesure qu’on le rendrait. Et, déjà, il sentait bien que les maisons de la rue du Bac ne brûlaient pas seules. Derrière son dos, il voyait le ciel s’embraser d’une immense lueur rouge, il entendait un grondement lointain, comme si toute la ville s’allumait. À droite, le long de la Seine, d’autres incendies géants devaient éclater. Depuis longtemps, il avait vu disparaître Chouteau, fuyant les balles. Les plus acharnés de ses camarades filaient eux-mêmes un à un, épouvantés par l’idée d’être tournés d’un moment à l’autre. Enfin, il restait seul, allongé entre deux sacs de terre, ne pensant qu’à tirer toujours, lorsque les soldats, qui avaient cheminé à travers les cours et les jardins, débouchèrent par une maison de la rue du Bac, et se rabattirent.","How long did Maurice still shoot? He was no longer aware of time or place. It could be nine o'clock, ten o'clock maybe. The execrable work he was doing now choked him with nausea, like a filthy wine that comes back in intoxication. Around him, the burning houses were beginning to envelope him in an unbearable heat, in an air burning with asphyxiation. The crossroads, with its heaps of paving stones which enclosed it, had become an entrenched camp, defended by fires, under a rain of embers. Weren't those the orders? to set fire to the quarters by abandoning the barricades, to stop the troops by a devouring line of braziers, to burn Paris as it was surrendered. And he already felt that the houses in the rue du Bac were not burning alone. Behind his back, he saw the sky ablaze with a huge red glow, he heard a distant rumble, as if the whole city was lighting up. To the right, along the Seine, other giant fires were to break out. For a long time he had seen Chouteau disappear, fleeing the bullets. The fiercest of his comrades themselves spun off one by one, terrified by the idea of being shot at any moment. Finally, he was left alone, lying between two sacks of earth, thinking only of continuing to fire, when the soldiers, who had made their way through the courtyards and the gardens, came out by a house in the rue du Bac, and fell back.","How much longer did Maurice stay there shooting? He had no sense of time or place. It might be nine, perhaps ten. The vile job he was doing now made him feel sick, like some disgusting wine coming back when you are drunk. The houses burning round him were beginning to encircle him with intolerable heat and choking hot air. The crossing, with the piles of paving stones enclosing it, had become a fortress defended by fires with sparks raining down. Were not these their orders? Set fire to districts as the barricades were abandoned, stop the troops with an all-destroying line of furnaces, burn Paris as they surrendered it. Already he had the impression that the houses in the rue du Bac were not the only ones burning. Behind his back he could see the sky lit up by an immense red glow and hear a distant roaring as though the whole city were catching fire. To his right along the Seine other huge fires must be breaking out. Chouteau had long since disappeared, dodging the bullets. Even the most fanatical of his comrades were sloping off one by one, terrified by the thought of being taken in the rear at any moment. In the end he was left alone, lying between two sandbags with only one thought, keep on firing, when the soldiers who had made their way through courtyards and gardens came from a house in the rue du Bac to take him in the rear.","How long did Maurice keep on firing? He could not tell; he had lost all consciousness of time and place. It might be nine o'clock, or ten, perhaps. He continued to load and fire; his condition of hopelessness and gloom was pitiable; death seemed to him long in coming. The detestable work he was engaged in gave him now a sensation of nausea, as the fumes of the wine he has drunk rise and nauseate the drunkard. An intense heat began to beat on him from the houses that were burning on every side—an air that scorched and asphyxiated. The carrefour, with the barricades that closed it in, was become an intrenched camp, guarded by the roaring flames that rose on every side and sent down showers of sparks. Those were the orders, were they not? to fire the adjacent houses before they abandoned the barricades, arrest the progress of the troops by an impassable sea of flame, burn Paris in the face of the enemy advancing to take possession of it. And presently he became aware that the houses in the Rue du Bac were not the only ones that were devoted to destruction; looking behind him he beheld the whole sky suffused with a bright, ruddy glow; he heard an ominous roar in the distance, as if all Paris were bursting into conflagration. Chouteau was no longer to be seen; he had long since fled to save his skin from the bullets. His comrades, too, even those most zealous in the cause, had one by one stolen away, affrighted at the approaching prospect of being outflanked. At last he was left alone, stretched at length between two sand bags, his every faculty bent on defending the front of the barricade, when the soldiers, who had made their way through the gardens in the middle of the block, emerged from a house in the Rue du Bac and pounced on him from the rear."
"– Comment ! c’est vous ? s’écria Delaherche, et dans quel état, bon Dieu !","- How ! it's you ? cried Delaherche, “and in what a state, good God!","‘What, you!’ exclaimed Delaherche. ‘Good Lord, what a state you’re in!’","Rumor had it that the captain had abdicated his position as first favorite and made way for the cloth merchant from motives of delicacy, not caring to stand in the way of the great good fortune that seemed coming to his fair friend. “Hallo, is that you?” exclaimed Delaherche. “Good Heavens, what a state you're in!”"
"Le capitaine Beaudoin, d’ailleurs, arrivait à peine, et le lieutenant Rochas n’avait ramené que vers deux heures la compagnie débandée, réduite des deux tiers. Maintenant, elle se retrouvait à peu près au complet. Quelques soldats étaient ivres, d’autres restaient à jeun, n’ayant pu se procurer un morceau de pain ; et les distributions, une fois de plus, venaient de manquer. Loubet, pourtant, s’était ingénié à faire cuire des choux, arrachés dans un jardin du voisinage ; mais il n’avait ni sel ni graisse, les estomacs continuaient à crier famine.","Captain Beaudoin, moreover, had barely arrived, and Lieutenant Rochas had not brought back the disbanded company until about two o'clock, reduced by two-thirds. Now she was almost complete. Some soldiers were drunk, others remained fasting, having been unable to obtain a piece of bread; and the distributions, once again, had just run out. Loubet, however, had contrived to cook cabbages, pulled up in a neighboring garden; but it had neither salt nor fat, the stomachs continued to cry out for hunger.","As a matter of fact Captain Beaudoin had only just got back, and Lieutenant Rochas had only returned at about two o’clock with the straggling company reduced by two thirds. Now it was more or less up to strength. Some of the soldiers were drunk, others were still famished, not having been able to scrounge a bit of bread. And once again rations had not turned up. Loubet, however, had contrived to cook some cabbages pinched from a garden somewhere, but he had neither salt nor fat and their stomachs were still crying out for something to eat.","Captain Beaudoin had made his appearance only a short time before, and it was about two o'clock when Lieutenant Rochas had brought in his collection of stragglers, about one-third of the company strength. Now the ranks were nearly full once more. Some of the men were drunk, others had not been able to secure even a morsel of bread and were sinking from inanition; again there had been no distribution of rations. Loubet, however, had discovered some cabbages in a neighboring garden, and cooked them after a fashion, but there was no salt or lard; the empty stomachs continued to assert their claims."
"– Dame ! aussi sûr qu’on peut l’être d’une chose qu’on a vue… C’était sur un petit monticule, à côté de trois arbres, et il me semble que j’irais, les yeux fermés.","- Lady ! sure as you can be of a thing you've seen... It was on a little mound, by the side of three trees, and I look like I'd go with my eyes closed.","‘Yes of course I am, as sure as you can be of anything you’ve seen… It was on a little mound, near three trees, and I think I could go there with my eyes shut.’","as certain as one can be of a thing he has seen with his own two eyes. It was on a little hillock, with three trees in a group right beside it; it seems to me I could go to the spot blindfolded.”"
"– Mademoiselle, on ne trouve plus rien, je ne puis pas mettre la main sur une bonne… Vous n’auriez pas un linge, un morceau de linge blanc ?","“Mademoiselle, we can’t find anything, I can’t get my hands on a good one… Do you have a piece of linen, a piece of white linen?”","‘Mademoiselle, we can’t find anything and I can’t run a maid to earth… You don’t happen to have any white material, a piece of white cloth?’","“Mademoiselle, the house is in confusion, I cannot find a servant.

"Mais, sur la route, le général Lebrun prit le galop, et il eut la chance, comme il arrivait à Balan, d’apercevoir le général de Wimpffen. Celui-ci, quelques minutes plus tôt, avait écrit à l’empereur : « Sire, venez vous mettre à la tête de vos troupes, elles tiendront à honneur de vous ouvrir un passage à travers les lignes ennemies. » Aussi entra-t-il dans une furieuse colère, au seul mot d’armistice. Non, non ! il ne signerait rien, il voulait se battre ! Il était trois heures et demie. Et ce fut peu de temps après qu’eut lieu la tentative héroïque et désespérée, cette poussée dernière, pour ouvrir une trouée au travers des Bavarois, en marchant une fois encore sur Bazeilles. Par les rues de Sedan, par les champs voisins, afin de rendre du cœur aux troupes, on mentait, on criait : « Bazaine arrive ! Bazaine arrive ! » Depuis le matin, c’était le rêve de beaucoup, on croyait entendre le canon de l’armée de Metz, à chaque batterie nouvelle que démasquaient les Allemands. Douze cents hommes environ furent réunis, des soldats débandés de tous les corps, où toutes les armes se mêlaient ; et la petite colonne se lança glorieusement, sur la route balayée de mitraille, au pas de course. D’abord, ce fut superbe, les hommes qui tombaient n’arrêtaient pas l’élan des autres, on parcourut près de cinq cents mètres avec une véritable furie de courage. Mais, bientôt, les rangs s’éclaircirent, les plus braves se replièrent. Que faire contre l’écrasement du nombre ? Il n’y avait là que la témérité folle d’un chef d’armée qui ne voulait pas être vaincu. Et le général de Wimpffen finit par se trouver seul avec le général Lebrun, sur cette route de Balan et de Bazeilles, qu’ils durent définitivement abandonner. Il ne restait qu’à battre en retraite sous les murs de Sedan.","But, on the road, General Lebrun took to the gallop, and he was lucky enough, as he was arriving at Balan, to see General de Wimpffen. The latter, a few minutes earlier, had written to the Emperor: “Sire, come and put yourself at the head of your troops, they will take it in their honor to open a passage for you through the enemy lines. So he flew into a fury at the mere word of armistice. No no ! he wouldn't sign anything, he wanted to fight! It was half past three. And it was soon after that the heroic and desperate attempt took place, that last push, to open a gap through the Bavarians, by marching once more on Bazeilles. Through the streets of Sedan, through the neighboring fields, in order to restore hearts to the troops, they lied, they shouted: ""Bazaine is coming!"" Bazaine is coming! Since the morning, it had been the dream of many, we thought we heard the cannon of the army of Metz, with each new battery that the Germans unmasked. About twelve hundred men were assembled, soldiers disbanded from all corps, in which all arms were mingled; and the little column set off gloriously, on the road swept with grapeshot, at a run. First, it was superb, the men who fell did not stop the momentum of the others, we covered nearly five hundred meters with a real fury of courage. But soon the ranks thinned, the bravest fell back. What to do against the crushing of the number? There was only the mad temerity of an army commander who did not want to be defeated. And General de Wimpffen ended up finding himself alone with General Lebrun, on this road to Balan and Bazeilles, which they had to abandon definitively. All that remained was to beat a retreat under the walls of Sedan.","Once out on the main road General Lebrun went at a gallop, and he was fortunate enough to see General de Wimpffen as soon as he reached Balan. The latter had written only a few minutes before to the Emperor: ‘Sir, come and put yourself at the head of your troops, and they will think it an honour to open up a way for you through the enemy lines.’ And so the very mention of the word armistice threw him into a furious rage. No, no, he wouldn’t sign anything, he was determined to fight! It was then half past three, and it was soon afterwards that the heroic and desperate attempt was made, the last thrust to open up a gap through the Bavarians by marching once again on Bazeilles. So as to put some heart back into the troops they spread a lie by shouting ‘Bazaine is coming, Bazaine is coming!’ Since first thing in the morning this had been the dream of so many who thought they could hear the guns of the army of Metz every time a new battery of the Germans was uncovered. About twelve hundred men were scraped together, stray soldiers from every corps and every arm, and the little column dashed gloriously at full speed along the bullet-swept road. At first it was sublime, falling men did not check the impetus of the rest, and they covered nearly five hundred metres with truly reckless courage. But soon the ranks began thinning, and even the bravest fell back. What could they do against overwhelming odds? It was simply the crazy folly of an army chief who did not want to be beaten. In the end General de Wimpffen found himself alone with General Lebrun on the Balan-Bazeilles road, which they had to abandon for good. There was nothing to be done but retreat into Sedan.","Once outside upon the road, however, General Lebrun struck into a gallop, and when near Balan had the good fortune to fall in with the chief. Only a few minutes previous to this the latter had written to the Emperor: “Sire, come and put yourself at the head of your troops; they will force a passage through the enemy's lines for you, or perish in the attempt;” therefore he flew into a furious passion at the mere mention of the word armistice. No, no! he would sign nothing, he would fight it out! This was about half-past three o'clock, and it was shortly afterward that occurred the gallant, but mad attempt, the last serious effort of the day, to pierce the Bavarian lines and regain possession of Bazeilles. In order to put heart into the troops a ruse was resorted to: in the streets of Sedan and in the fields outside the walls the shout was raised: “Bazaine is coming up! Bazaine is at hand!” Ever since morning many had allowed themselves to be deluded by that hope; each time that the Germans opened fire with a fresh battery it was confidently asserted to be the guns of the army of Metz. In the neighborhood of twelve hundred men were collected, soldiers of all arms, from every corps, and the little column bravely advanced into the storm of missiles that swept the road, at double time. It was a splendid spectacle of heroism and endurance while it lasted; the numerous casualties did not check the ardor of the survivors, nearly five hundred yards were traversed with a courage and nerve that seemed almost like madness; but soon there were great gaps in the ranks, the bravest began to fall back. What could they do against overwhelming numbers? It was a mad attempt, anyway; the desperate effort of a commander who could not bring himself to acknowledge that he was defeated. And it ended by General de Wimpffen finding himself and General Lebrun alone together on the Bazeilles road, which they had to make up their mind to abandon to the enemy, for good and all. All that remained for them to do was to retreat and seek security under the walls of Sedan."
"– Vous ne savez pas, ce soir, nous allons le suivre… Nous verrons s’il ose s’emplir tout seul, quand de pauvres bougres crèvent à côté de lui.","- You don't know, tonight we're going to follow him... We'll see if he dares fill himself up, when poor buggers are dying next to him.","‘Tell you what, we’ll follow him tonight. We’ll see if he dares to stuff his guts all on his own when other poor sods are dying of hunger all round him.’","“To-night we'll keep a watch on him, don't you see. We'll learn whether he dares to stuff himself on the sly, when so many poor devils are starving all around him.”"
"Maurice, lui aussi, avait les mains brûlantes du désir de lâcher au moins un coup de feu. Et il revenait sur la faute qu’on avait commise, la veille, en n’allant pas soutenir le 5e corps. Si les Prussiens n’attaquaient point, ce devait être qu’ils n’avaient pas encore assez d’infanterie à leur disposition ; de sorte que leurs démonstrations de cavalerie, à distance, ne pouvaient avoir d’autre but que d’attarder les corps en marche. De nouveau, on venait de tomber dans le piège. Et, en effet, à partir de ce moment, le 106e vit sans cesse les uhlans, sur sa gauche, à chaque accident de terrain : ils le suivaient, le surveillaient, disparaissaient derrière une ferme pour reparaître à la corne d’un bois.","Maurice, too, had his hands burning with the desire to fire at least one shot. And he went back to the mistake we had made the day before, by not going to support the 5th Corps. If the Prussians did not attack, it must have been that they did not yet have enough infantry at their disposal; so that their demonstrations of cavalry, at a distance, could have no other object than to delay the corps on the march. Once again, we had just fallen into the trap. And, in fact, from that moment on, the 106th constantly saw the Uhlans, on its left, at each uneven ground: they followed it, watched it, disappeared behind a farm to reappear at the edge of a wood.","Maurice too felt his hands itching with the desire to fire at least one shot. Once again he went over the mistake that had been made the day before by not going to support the 5th corps. If the Prussians were not attacking it must be because they still had not enough infantry at their disposal, which meant that their displays of cavalry in the distance could have no other object than to delay the movement of the French army corps. Once again they had fallen into the trap. And as a matter of fact from that moment onwards the 106th constantly spotted Uhlans to the left on every bit of high ground, following them, keeping an eye on them, disappearing behind a farmhouse only to reappear round the tip of a wood.","Maurice, too, had felt his finger-tips tingling with the desire to have just one shot. He kept harping on the theme of the mistake they had made the day before in not going to the support of the 5th corps. If the Prussians had not made their attack yet, it must be because their infantry had not got up in sufficient strength, whence it was evident that their display of cavalry in the distance was made with no other end than to harass us and check the advance of our corps. We had again fallen into the trap set for us, and thenceforth the regiment was constantly greeted with the sight of uhlans popping up on its left flank wherever the ground was favorable for them, tracking it like sleuthhounds, disappearing behind a farmhouse only to reappear at the corner of a wood."
"Longtemps, on continua de la sorte à se cribler de balles, d’un bord du vallon à l’autre. De temps en temps, dès qu’il avait l’imprudence de se découvrir, un homme tombait, la poitrine trouée. Dans l’allée, il y avait trois nouveaux morts. Un blessé, étendu sur la face, râlait affreusement, sans que personne songeât à l’aller retourner, pour lui adoucir l’agonie.","For a long time, we continued in this way to be riddled with bullets, from one side of the valley to the other. From time to time, as soon as he had the imprudence to uncover himself, a man would fall with a hole in his chest. In the driveway, there were three new dead. A wounded man, stretched out on his face, gasped horribly, without anyone thinking of turning him over, to ease his agony.","For a long time they went on riddling each other with bullets from one side of the valley to the other. Now and again any man who was unwise enough to emerge from cover went down with a bullet through his body. Three more were killed in the avenue. One wounded man had fallen on his face and was gasping horribly, but nobody dreamed of turning him over to relieve his agony.","For a quarter of an hour the bullets flew thick and fast from one side of the valley to the other. Now and again someone who was so incautious as to expose himself went down with a ball in his head or chest. There were three men lying dead in the avenue. The rattling in the throat of another man who had fallen prone upon his face was something horrible to listen to, and no one thought to go and turn him on his back to ease his dying agony."
"Cependant, Jean, lui aussi, songeait à Henriette ; et brusquement, l’idée de Delaherche lui vint. Il poussa du coude son ami.","However, Jean, too, was thinking of Henriette; and suddenly the idea of Delaherche came to him. He nudged his friend.","Jean was thinking of Henriette too, and then he suddenly thought of Delaherche. He nudged his friend.","Jean had recovered his equanimity; his thoughts, like Maurice's, reverted to Henriette, and the idea occurred to him that they might see Delaherche somewhere among the throng. He gave his friend a nudge of the elbow."
"Dehors, le ciel était très noir, sur la neige blanche. Pas un bruit ne venait du village enseveli, on n’entendait dans la salle que le couteau de Prosper, très appliqué à orner de losanges et de rosaces le manche de cornouiller. Par moments, il s’arrêtait, il regardait Charlot, dont la grosse tête blonde vacillait, prise de sommeil. L’enfant ayant fini par s’endormir, il sembla que le silence augmentait encore. Doucement, la mère avait écarté la chandelle, pour que son petit n’en eût pas la clarté sur les paupières ; puis, cousant toujours, elle était tombée dans une rêverie profonde.","Outside, the sky was very black, on the white snow. Not a sound came from the buried village, all that was heard in the room was Prosper's knife, very diligent in adorning the dogwood handle with lozenges and rosettes. From time to time he stopped, he looked at the Tramp, whose big blond head was wobbling, overcome with sleep. The child having finally fallen asleep, it seemed that the silence increased still further. Gently, the mother had pushed aside the candle, so that her little one would not have its light on his eyelids; then, still sewing, she fell into a deep reverie.","It was very dark outside against the white snow. Not a sound came from the shrouded village, and the only thing that could be heard was Prosper’s knife as he busied himself adorning the dogwood handle with lozenges and rosettes. He paused occasionally and glanced at Chariot, whose big blond head was beginning to fall about with sleep. When the child did eventually go to sleep the silence seemed still deeper. His mother gently moved the candle away so that the little boy should not have the light in his eyes, and then, without stopping her sewing, she fell into a daydream.","Outside a sky of inky blackness overhung the white expanse of snow. No sound came from the village, buried among the drifts; all that was to be heard in the kitchen was the scraping of Prosper's knife as he fashioned elaborate rosettes and lozenges on the dogwood stock. Now and then he stopped and cast a glance at Charlot, whose flaxen head was nodding drowsily. When the child fell asleep at last the silence seemed more profound than ever. The mother noiselessly changed the position of the candle that the light might not strike the eyes of her little one; then sitting down to her sewing again, she sank into a deep reverie."
"– Tu as boulotté l’argent de l’escouade, ose donc dire le contraire, bougre de fricoteur !","- You have eaten the squad's money, so dare to say the opposite, you bugger!","‘You’ve blued the squad’s money, and don’t you dare to deny it, you bleeding swindler!’","“You stole the money belonging to the squad; deny it if you dare, you bougre of a belly-god!”"
"Les feux, sur les deux rives, brûlaient plus haut, et leur clarté en ce moment devenait si vive, que la scène, dans son effroi, s’évoquait avec une netteté d’apparition. Sous le poids de la cavalerie et de l’artillerie défilant depuis le matin, les bacs qui supportaient les madriers, avaient fini par s’enfoncer, de sorte que le tablier se trouvait dans l’eau, à quelques centimètres. C’étaient maintenant les cuirassiers qui passaient, deux par deux, d’une file ininterrompue, sortant de l’ombre de l’une des berges pour rentrer dans l’ombre de l’autre ; et l’on ne voyait plus le pont, ils semblaient marcher sur l’eau, sur cette eau violemment éclairée, où dansait un incendie. Les chevaux hennissants, les crins effarés, les jambes raidies, s’avançaient dans la terreur de ce terrain mouvant, qu’ils sentaient fuir. Debout sur les étriers, serrant les guides, les cuirassiers passaient, passaient toujours, drapés dans leurs grands manteaux blancs, ne montrant que leurs casques tout allumés de reflets rouges. Et l’on aurait cru des cavaliers fantômes allant à la guerre des ténèbres, avec des chevelures de flammes.","The fires, on both banks, burned higher, and their brightness at this moment became so lively, that the scene, in its terror, was evoked with a clearness of apparition. Under the weight of the cavalry and artillery marching past since the morning, the tubs that supported the beams had ended up sinking, so that the apron was in the water, a few centimeters away. It was now the cuirassiers passing, two by two, in an unbroken file, emerging from the shadow of one of the banks to re-enter the shadow of the other; and the bridge could no longer be seen, they seemed to be walking on water, on this violently lit water, where a fire danced. The horses, whinnying, frightened mane, stiff legs, advanced in terror of this shifting ground, which they felt fleeing. Standing on the stirrups, clutching the guides, the cuirassiers passed, still passing, draped in their great white coats, showing only their helmets all lit up with red reflections. And it looked like phantom riders going to the war of darkness, with hair of flames.","The fires on both sides of the river were blazing higher and their light was so intense that the frightening scene stood out with nightmarish clarity. Under the weight of the cavalry and artillery passing over since morning the pontoons supporting the baulks of timber had sunk lower, so that the flooring was a few centimetres under water. At that moment the cuirassiers were crossing two by two in an uninterrupted line, emerging from the shadows on one bank and disappearing into the shadows on the other, and as the bridge itself could no longer be seen they appeared to be walking in the water, or on top of water luridly ablaze with dancing fires. The horses were whinnying as, manes standing on end and legs stiff, they moved forward in terror of the shifting ground they felt giving way beneath them. Standing in the stirrups and tugging the reins, the cuirassiers went on and on, draped in their long white cloaks and showing only their helmets flaming with red reflected fire. They might have been taken for phantom horsemen riding to a ghostly war with hair flaming.","The fires upon both banks blazed up more brightly just then, and their light was so intense that the whole fearful scene was pictured on the darkness with vivid distinctness. The boats on which the longitudinal girders rested, owing to the weight of the cavalry and artillery that had been crossing uninterruptedly since morning, had settled to such an extent that the floor of the bridge was covered with water. The cuirassiers were passing at the time, two abreast, in a long unbroken file, emerging from the obscurity of the hither shore to be swallowed up in the shadows of the other, and nothing was to be seen of the bridge; they appeared to be marching on the bosom of the ruddy stream, that flashed and danced in the flickering firelight. The horses snorted and hung back, manifesting every indication of terror as they felt the unstable pathway yielding beneath their feet, and the cuirassiers, standing erect in their stirrups and clutching at the reins, poured onward in a steady, unceasing stream, wrapped in their great white mantles, their helmets flashing in the red light of the flames. One might have taken them for some spectral band of knights, with locks of fire, going forth to do battle with the powers of darkness."
"– Caporal, si vous le permettez…","– Corporal, if you allow it…","‘Do you mind, corporal?’","“Corporal, will you allow me—”"
"Mais Chouteau, ricanant, le hua. Il s’en fichait pas mal de son rapport ! Il se battrait ou il ne se battrait pas, à son idée ; et il ne fallait plus qu’on l’embêtât, parce qu’il n’avait pas des cartouches que pour les Prussiens. À présent que la bataille était commencée, le peu de discipline, maintenue par la peur, s’effondrait : qu’est-ce qu’on pouvait lui faire ? il filerait, dès qu’il en aurait assez. Et il fut grossier, excitant les autres contre le caporal, qui les laissait mourir de faim. Oui, c’était sa faute, si l’escouade n’avait rien mangé depuis trois jours, tandis que les camarades avaient eu de la soupe et de la viande. Mais monsieur était allé se goberger avec l’aristo chez des filles. On les avait bien vus, à Sedan.","But Chouteau, sneering, hooted him. He didn't really care about his report! He would fight or he would not fight, as he thought; and it was no longer necessary to bother him, because he had cartridges only for the Prussians. Now that the battle had begun, the little discipline, held together by fear, was crumbling: what could be done to him? he would spin, as soon as he had had enough. And he was rude, inciting the others against the corporal, who starved them to death. Yes, it was his fault that the squad hadn't eaten anything for three days, while the comrades had had soup and meat. But Monsieur had gone to eat with the aristo at the girls' house. We had seen them well, at Sedan.","But Chouteau sneered and booed at him. He didn’t give a hoot for his report! He would fight or he wouldn’t, just as he felt inclined, and they’d better not get across him any more, because he hadn’t got bullets for Prussians only! Now that the battle was under way what little discipline had been maintained by fear was collapsing: what could anyone do to him? He’d just piss off when he had had enough. He began a slanging match, working the others up against the corporal who let them die of hunger. Yes, it was his fault that the squad hadn’t had anything to eat for three days while the other blokes had had soup and meat. But of course the gentleman went out guzzling with his lordship and the tarts. Oh yes, they’d been seen in Sedan all right!","But Chouteau sneered and jeered at him; what did he care whether he reported him or not! He was not going to fight unless he chose, and they need not try to ride him rough-shod, because he had cartridges in his box for other people beside the Prussians. They were going into action now, and what discipline had been maintained by fear would be at an end: what could they do to him, anyway? he would just skip as soon as he thought he had enough of it. And he was profane and obscene, egging the men on against the corporal, who had been allowing them to starve. Yes, it was his fault that the squad had had nothing to eat in the last three days, while their neighbors had soup and fresh meat in plenty, but “monsieur” had to go off to town with the “aristo” and enjoy himself with the girls. People had spotted 'em, over in Sedan."
"Henriette tardait à répondre, prise d’un grand trouble intérieur. N’était-ce pas, au fond, pour Jean qu’elle venait, pour être certaine que, l’oncle relâché, on n’inquiéterait plus son cher malade ? Cela l’avait emplie de confusion, d’entendre Gilberte parler de lui, et elle n’osait plus dire le motif véritable de sa visite, la conscience désormais souffrante, répugnant à employer l’influence louche qu’elle lui croyait.","Henriette was slow to answer, seized with great inner turmoil. Wasn't it really for Jean that she had come, to be certain that, once her uncle was released, her dear patient would no longer be disturbed? It had filled her with confusion, to hear Gilberte speak of him, and she no longer dared to say the real reason for her visit, her conscience henceforth suffering, reluctant to use the suspicious influence she believed him to be.","Henriette hesitated to answer, feeling very embarrassed. For wasn’t it really for Jean’s sake that she was coming, in order to make sure that once her uncle was released they wouldn’t worry her beloved invalid any more? Merely hearing Gilberte mention him had filled her with confusion, and she now dared not reveal the real motive of her visit, for her conscience began to worry her and she recoiled from using the questionable influence she believed Gilberte to have.","Henriette's conscience smote her, and she did not answer. Was it not really for Jean's sake that she had come, in order that, the old uncle being released, the invalid, who had grown so dear to her, might have no further cause for alarm? It distressed her to hear his name mentioned by Gilberte; she could not endure the thought of enlisting in his favor an influence that was of so ambiguous a character. Her inbred scruples of a pure, honest woman made themselves felt, now it seemed to her that the rumors of a liaison with the Prussian captain had some foundation."
"Mais il branlait la tête, on lui avait toujours fait peur de la République, lorsqu’il était paysan. Et puis, devant l’ennemi, ça ne lui semblait guère bon, de n’être pas d’accord. Enfin, il fallait bien qu’il vînt autre chose, puisque l’Empire était pourri décidément, et que personne n’en voulait plus.","But he shook his head, he had always been afraid of the Republic when he was a peasant. And then, in front of the enemy, it did not seem good to him to disagree. Finally, something else had to happen, since the Empire was decidedly rotten, and no one wanted it anymore.","But he shook his head, for he had always been led to fear a republic when he worked on the land. And besides, in the face of the enemy he didn’t think it was a good thing not to be all of one mind. Anyway there would have to be something else because the Empire was thoroughly corrupt, and nobody wanted any more truck with it.","But he shook his head; he had always been taught to look distrustfully on republics when he was a peasant. And then, too, it did not seem to him a good thing that they should be of differing minds when the enemy was fronting them. After all, though, it was manifest there had to be a change of some kind, since everyone knew the Empire was rotten to the core and the people would have no more of it."
"– Comment ! hier, on s’est battu ?","- How ! yesterday, we fought?","‘What, was there fighting yesterday?’","“What, yesterday? There was fighting yesterday?”"
"Au milieu, sur le fond sombre de la forêt des Ardennes, drapée à l’horizon ainsi qu’un rideau d’antique verdure, Sedan se détachait, avec les lignes géométriques de ses fortifications, que les prés inondés et le fleuve noyaient au sud et à l’ouest. Dans Bazeilles, des maisons flambaient déjà, une poussière de bataille embrumait le village. Puis, à l’est, de la Moncelle à Givonne, on ne voyait, pareils à des lignes d’insectes, traversant les chaumes, que quelques régiments du 12e corps et du 1er, qui disparaissaient par moments dans l’étroit vallon, où les hameaux étaient cachés ; et, en face, l’autre revers apparaissait, des champs pâles, que le bois Chevalier tachait de sa masse verte. Mais surtout, au nord, le 7e corps était bien en vue, occupant de ses mouvants points noirs le plateau de Floing, une large bande de terres rougeâtres qui descendait du petit bois de la Garenne aux herbages du bord de l’eau. Au delà, c’était encore Floing, Saint-Menges, Fleigneux, Illy, des villages perdus parmi la houle des terrains, toute une région tourmentée, coupée d’escarpements. Et c’était aussi, à gauche, la boucle de la Meuse, les eaux lentes, d’argent neuf au clair soleil, enfermant la presqu’île d’Iges de son vaste et paresseux détour, barrant tout chemin vers Mézières, ne laissant, entre la berge extrême et les inextricables forêts, que la porte unique du défilé de Saint-Albert.","In the middle, against the dark background of the Ardennes forest, draped on the horizon like a curtain of ancient greenery, Sedan stood out, with the geometric lines of its fortifications, which the flooded meadows and the river drowned to the south. and west. In Bazeilles, houses were already on fire, the dust of battle clouded the village. Then, to the east, from La Moncelle to Givonne, one saw, like lines of insects, crossing the stubble fields, only a few regiments of the 12th corps and the 1st, which disappeared at times into the narrow valley, where the hamlets were hidden; and, opposite, the other side appeared, pale fields, which the Bois Chevalier stained with its green mass. But above all, to the north, the 7th corps was in full view, occupying with its moving black spots the plateau of Floing, a wide strip of reddish land which descended from the small wood of La Garenne to the grasslands of the edge of the water. Beyond, there was still Floing, Saint-Menges, Fleigneux, Illy, villages lost among the swell of the terrain, a whole tormented region, cut by escarpments. And there was also, on the left, the loop of the Meuse, the slow waters, new silver in the bright sunshine, enclosing the peninsula of Iges with its vast and lazy detour, barring all paths towards Mézières, leaving , between the extreme bank and the inextricable forests, that the single door of the parade of Saint-Albert.","In the middle, against the dark background of the forest of the Ardennes, draped across the horizon like a curtain of antique verdure, Sedan stood out with the geometrical lines of its fortifications, lapped by the flooded meadows and river on the south and west. In Bazeilles houses were already on fire and the village was half obscured with the dust of battle. Then eastwards, from La Moncelle to Givonne, all that could be seen was a few regiments of the 12th corps and the 1st, crawling like lines of insects across the stubble and sometimes disappearing in the narrow valley where the hamlets were hidden; and on the opposite side the other rising ground could be seen, light-coloured fields with the green patch of the Chevalier wood. But what could be most clearly seen was the 7th corps, to the north, filling with its moving black dots the plateau of Floing, a broad band of reddish earth stretching from the little Garenne wood down to the grassland by the river. Beyond that there was still Floing, Saint-Menges, Fleigneux, Illy, villages huddled away in the ups and downs of the land in a rugged piece of country broken up by escarpments. To the left also was the loop of the Meuse, with its slow waters, pale silver in the bright sun, enclosing the peninsula of Iges in its vast meandering detour, cutting off all routes to Mézières and only leaving between its further bank and the impassable forests the one outlet of the Saint-Albert gap.","In the central foreground of the picture, and standing out in bold relief against the venerable forests of the Ardennes, that stretched away on either hand from right to left, filling the northern horizon like a curtain of dark verdure, was the city of Sedan, with the geometrical lines and angles of its fortifications, protected on the south and west by the flooded meadows and the river. In Bazeilles houses were already burning, and the dark cloud of war hung heavy over the pretty village. Turning his eyes eastward he might discover, holding the line between la Moncelle and Givonne, some regiments of the 12th and 1st corps, looking like diminutive insects at that distance and lost to sight at intervals in the dip of the narrow valley in which the hamlets lay concealed; and beyond that valley rose the further slope, an uninhabited, uncultivated heath, of which the pale tints made the dark green of Chevalier's Wood look black by contrast. To the north the 7th corps was more distinctly visible in its position on the plateau of Floing, a broad belt of sere, dun fields, that sloped downward from the little wood of la Garenne to the verdant border of the stream. Further still were Floing, Saint-Menges, Fleigneux, Illy, small villages that lay nestled in the hollows of that billowing region where the landscape was a succession of hill and dale. And there, too, to the left was the great bend of the Meuse, where the sluggish stream, shimmering like molten silver in the bright sunlight, swept lazily in a great horseshoe around the peninsula of Iges and barred the road to Mezieres, leaving between its further bank and the impassable forest but one single gateway, the defile of Saint-Albert."
"Alors, pendant qu’on revenait vers le camp, Maurice songea à ces compagnies franches, sur lesquelles on avait fondé tant d’espérances, et qui déjà, de partout, soulevaient des plaintes. Elles devaient faire la guerre d’embuscade, attendre l’ennemi derrière les haies, le harceler, lui tuer ses sentinelles, tenir les bois d’où pas un Prussien ne sortirait. Et, à la vérité, elles étaient en train de devenir la terreur des paysans, qu’elles défendaient mal et dont elles ravageaient les champs. Par exécration du service militaire régulier, tous les déclassés se hâtaient d’en faire partie, heureux d’échapper à la discipline, de battre les buissons comme des bandits en goguette, dormant et godaillant au hasard des routes. Dans certaines de ces compagnies, le recrutement fut vraiment déplorable.","Then, while they were returning to the camp, Maurice thought of those free companies, on which so many hopes had been founded, and which were already raising complaints from everywhere. They were to wage war by ambush, wait for the enemy behind the hedges, harass him, kill his sentinels, hold the woods from which not a Prussian would emerge. And, in truth, they were in the process of becoming the terror of the peasants, whom they defended badly and whose fields they ravaged. Out of loathing for regular military service, all the downgraded hurried to join it, happy to escape discipline, beat the bushes like bandits on the run, sleeping and jiggling haphazardly along the roads. In some of these companies, recruiting was truly deplorable.","On their way back to camp Maurice thought about these freelance companies on whom so many hopes had been built, and who already were giving rise to complaints on all sides. They were supposed to carry on guerrilla warfare, lie in wait for the enemy behind hedges, harass him, pick off his sentries and keep an eye on the woods from which no Prussian would ever get out alive. But the truth of the matter was that they were becoming the terror of the peasants, whom they were not defending at all and whose fields they were plundering. Out of hatred for regular military service all the drop-outs were rushing to join these gangs and enjoy freedom from discipline, roam at large like a lot of bandits out on the spree, sleeping and guzzling any old where. The recruits in some of these companies were deplorable types.","On the way back to the camp Maurice reflected on those free companies that had excited such great expectations at the time of their formation, and had since been the object of such bitter denunciation throughout the country. Their professed purpose was to wage a sort of guerilla warfare, lying in ambush behind hedges, harassing the enemy, picking off his sentinels, holding the woods, from which not a Prussian was to emerge alive; while the truth of the matter was that they had made themselves the terror of the peasantry, whom they failed utterly to protect and whose fields they devastated. Every ne'er-do-well who hated the restraints of the regular service made haste to join their ranks, well pleased with the chance that exempted him from discipline and enabled him to lead the life of a tramp, tippling in pothouses and sleeping by the roadside at his own sweet will. Some of the companies were recruited from the very worst material imaginable."
"Le fusil tourna deux fois sur lui-même, alla s’abattre dans un sillon et resta là, très long, immobile, pareil à un mort. Déjà, d’autres volaient, le rejoignaient. Le champ bientôt fut plein d’armes gisantes, d’une tristesse raidie d’abandon, sous le lourd soleil. Ce fut une épidémique folie, la faim qui tordait les estomacs, les chaussures qui blessaient les pieds, cette marche dont on souffrait, cette défaite imprévue dont on entendait derrière soi la menace. Plus rien à espérer de bon, les chefs qui lâchaient pied, l’intendance qui ne les nourrissait seulement pas, la colère, l’embêtement, l’envie d’en finir tout de suite, avant d’avoir commencé. Alors, quoi ? le fusil pouvait aller rejoindre le sac. Et, dans une rage imbécile, au milieu de ricanements de fous qui s’amusent, les fusils volaient, le long de la queue sans fin des traînards, épars au loin dans la campagne.","The gun turned twice on itself, went down in a furrow and remained there, very long, motionless, like a corpse. Already, others were flying, joining him. The field was soon full of arms lying in the stiff sadness of abandonment under the heavy sun. It was an epidemic madness, the hunger which twisted the stomachs, the shoes which hurt the feet, this walk from which one suffered, this unforeseen defeat whose threat one heard behind one. Nothing good to hope for anymore, the leaders who gave up, the stewardship that simply did not feed them, the anger, the annoyance, the desire to end it immediately, before having started. So what ? the rifle could join the bag. And, in imbecile rage, amid the sneers of amused madmen, the rifles flew, along the endless queue of stragglers, scattered far and wide in the countryside.","The rifle turned two somersaults and landed in a furrow where it lay at full length, still as a corpse. Others were already flying to join it. Soon the field was full of weapons lying there stiff and forlorn beneath the sweltering sun. An infectious madness spread, hunger was twisting their guts, boots were hurting their feet, this march was a torture, with unforeseen defeat growling threateningly in their rear. Nothing good left to expect, their leaders losing their grip, the commissariat not even feeding them, anger, frustration, desire to have done with it at once, before even beginning. So what! Let their guns join their packs. In a silly burst of temper and amid the gigglings of a lot of grinning idiots, the guns flew away all down the long, long tail of stragglers stretching back over the countryside.","The musket made two revolutions in the air and fell into a furrow, where it lay, long and motionless, reminding one somehow of a corpse. Others soon flew to join it, and presently the field was filled with abandoned arms, lying in long winrows, a sorrowful spectacle beneath the blazing sky. It was an epidemic of madness, caused by the hunger that was gnawing at their stomach, the shoes that galled their feet, their weary march, the unexpected defeat that had brought the enemy galloping at their heels. There was nothing more to be accomplished; their leaders were looking out for themselves, the commissariat did not even feed them; nothing but weariness and worriment; better to leave the whole business at once, before it was begun. And what then? why, the musket might go and keep the knapsack company; in view of the work that was before them they might at least as well keep their arms free. And all down the long line of stragglers that stretched almost far as the eye could reach in the smooth and fertile country the muskets flew through the air to the accompaniment of jeers and laughter such as would have befitted the inmates of a lunatic asylum out for a holiday."
"– Tout va bien, on hisse le drapeau blanc, on va cesser le feu !","– All is well, we hoist the white flag, we will cease fire!","‘Everything’s all right, they’re running up the white flag and there’s going to be a cease fire!’",“It is all right! they are hoisting the white flag; the cannonade won't last much longer.”
"À ce moment, Henriette, ayant levé la tête, fut saisie d’apercevoir, à quelques pas d’elle, au milieu d’un groupe, Delaherche, racontant les terribles dangers qu’il venait de courir, de Bazeilles à Sedan. Comment se trouvait-il là ? Elle ne l’avait pas vu entrer.","At this moment Henriette, having raised her head, was startled to see, a few paces from her, in the midst of a group, Delaherche, relating the terrible dangers he had just run from Bazeilles to Sedan. How was he there? She hadn't seen him come in.","Just then Henriette looked up and was amazed to see, standing in a group of people a few steps away, Delaherche, holding forth about the terrible dangers he had just come through between Bazeilles and Sedan. How had he got here? She hadn’t seen him come in.","At that moment, just as Henriette raised her head to listen to the cannonade, which was then roaring with increased viciousness, she was thunderstruck to see Delaherche standing only a few steps away in the middle of a group of men, to whom he was telling the story of the frightful dangers he had encountered in getting from Bazeilles to Sedan. How did he happen to be there? She had not seen him come in. She darted toward him."
"– Dites donc, vous gênez pas, si vous avez soif… Y en a encore pour les camarades…","- Say, don't bother if you're thirsty... There's still some for the comrades...","‘Look here, don’t worry if you’re thirsty… Plenty left for my pals.’","“Say, fellows, don't stand on ceremony if you're thirsty. There's enough left for the comrades.”"
– C’est juré… Attends-moi.,- It's sworn... Wait for me.,‘We’ve sworn… wait for me.’,“It is a promise. Wait for me.”
"– Oh ! ma chère dame, nous ne tenons plus debout. Maman vient d’aller se reposer un peu. Pensez donc ! la nuit entière, il a fallu être sur pied, avec ces allées et venues continuelles.","- Oh ! my dear lady, we can no longer stand. Mom just went to rest a bit. So think! the whole night, it was necessary to be on foot, with these continual comings and goings.","‘Oh, dear lady, we’re simply dropping! Mother has just gone for a little rest. Just think, all night long and we have had to be on our feet with these continual comings and goings!’","“Oh! dear lady, we are so tired we can scarcely stand; mamma has gone to lie down and rest a while. Just think! all night long people have been coming and going, and we have not been able to get a wink of sleep.”"
"Des heures encore s’écoulèrent, il ne se battait plus que dans la détresse, ne retrouvant en lui, debout, que la sombre volonté de mourir. S’il s’était trompé, qu’il payât au moins l’erreur de son sang ! La barricade qui fermait la rue de Lille, à la hauteur de la rue du Bac, était très forte, faite de sacs et de tonneaux de terre, précédée d’un fossé profond. Il la défendait avec une douzaine à peine d’autres fédérés, tous à demi couchés, tuant à coup sûr chaque soldat qui se montrait. Lui, jusqu’à la nuit tombante, ne bougea pas, épuisa ses cartouches, silencieux, dans l’entêtement de son désespoir. Il regardait grossir les grandes fumées du palais de la Légion d’honneur, que le vent rabattait au milieu de la rue, sans qu’on pût encore voir les flammes, sous le jour finissant. Un autre incendie avait éclaté dans un hôtel voisin. Et, brusquement, un camarade vint l’avertir que les soldats, n’osant prendre la barricade de front, étaient en train de cheminer à travers les jardins et les maisons, trouant les murs à coups de pioche. C’était la fin, ils pouvaient déboucher là, d’un instant à l’autre. Et, en effet, un coup de feu plongeant étant parti d’une fenêtre, il revit Chouteau et ses hommes qui montaient frénétiquement, à droite et à gauche, dans les maisons d’angle, avec leur pétrole et des torches. Une demi-heure plus tard, sous le ciel devenu noir, tout le carrefour flambait ; pendant que lui, toujours couché derrière les tonneaux et les sacs, profitait de l’intense clarté pour abattre les soldats imprudents qui se risquaient dans l’enfilade de la rue, hors des portes.","Hours more passed, he only fought in distress, finding in himself, standing, only the dark will to die. If he was wrong, let him at least pay for the error with his blood! The barricade which closed the rue de Lille, at the height of the rue du Bac, was very strong, made of sacks and barrels of earth, preceded by a deep ditch. He was defending it with barely a dozen other Federals, all half lying down, sure to kill every soldier who showed himself. He, until nightfall, did not move, exhausted his cartridges, silent, in the stubbornness of his despair. He watched the great smoke swell from the Palace of the Legion of Honor, which the wind blew back into the middle of the street, without the flames still being visible in the dying light. Another fire had broken out in a nearby hotel. And, suddenly, a comrade came to warn him that the soldiers, not daring to take the barricade head-on, were marching through the gardens and the houses, piercing the walls with pickaxes. That was the end, they could come out there any minute. And, indeed, a plunging shot having gone out from a window, he saw again Chouteau and his men who were climbing frantically, to the right and to the left, in the corner houses, with their oil and torches. Half an hour later, under the darkened sky, the whole intersection was on fire; while he, still lying behind the barrels and the sacks, took advantage of the intense light to shoot down the imprudent soldiers who ventured into the enfilade of the street, outside the gates.","Still more hours went by and he was only fighting now with sickness in his heart, finding nothing left intact within him but a sullen wish for death. If he had been mistaken, then at least he could redeem the error with his blood! The barricade across the rue de Lille at the junction with the rue du Bac was very strongly built of sandbags and barrels full of earth with a deep trench in front. He was defending it with barely a dozen Federals, all lying almost flat and picking off any soldier who showed himself. Until nightfall he stayed there and used up his ammunition in obstinate, despairing silence. He watched the clouds of smoke from the Palace of the Legion of Honour getting denser as the wind blew them down into the middle of the road, but so far no flames could be seen in the failing light. Another fire had broken out in a mansion nearby. Suddenly a comrade came and told him that the soldiers, not wanting to risk a frontal attack on the barricades, were making their way through gardens and houses, battering holes through the walls with picks. This was the end, they might emerge here at any moment. And indeed a shot had been fired down on them from a window. He caught sight of Chouteau and his gang rushing madly into the corner houses on each side with their paraffin and torches. Half an hour later, when the sky was quite black, the whole crossroad was ablaze while he, still lying behind the barrels and sandbags, could take advantage of the brilliant light and shoot down soldiers who unwisely ventured out of doorways into the open roadway.","Hours passed, and still he fought on, but with a bitter feeling of distress, with no other wish than that he might die. If he had erred, let him at least atone for his error with his blood! The barricade across the Rue de Lille, near its intersection with the Rue du Bac, was a formidable one, composed of bags and casks filled with earth and faced by a deep ditch. He and a scant dozen of other federates were its only defenders, resting in a semi-recumbent position on the ground, infallibly causing every soldier who exposed himself to bite the dust. He lay there, without even changing his position, until nightfall, using up his cartridges in silence, in the dogged sullenness of his despair. The dense clouds of smoke from the Palace of the Legion of Honor were billowing upward in denser masses, the flames undistinguishable as yet in the dying daylight, and he watched the fantastic, changing forms they took as the wind whirled them downward to the street. Another fire had broken out in an hotel not far away. And all at once a comrade came running up to tell him that the enemy, not daring to advance along the street, were making a way for themselves through the houses and gardens, breaking down the walls with picks. The end was close at hand; they might come out in the rear of the barricade at any moment. A shot having been fired from an upper window of a house on the corner, he saw Chouteau and his gang, with their petroleum and their lighted torch, rush with frantic speed to the buildings on either side and climb the stairs, and half an hour later, in the increasing darkness, the entire square was in flames, while he, still prone on the ground behind his shelter, availed himself of the vivid light to pick off any venturesome soldier who stepped from his protecting doorway into the narrow street."
"Et, pour rien, pour la rigolade, parce que l’idée de la soupe le rendait gai et farceur, il flanqua la pierre avec la viande dans la marmite pleine d’eau.","And, for nothing, for fun, because the idea of the soup made him cheerful and playful, he threw the stone with the meat into the pot full of water.","And for no reason, except that it was a lark and the thought of the stew made him feel gay and full of fun, he chucked the stone into the pot of water, together with the meat.","And for no reason at all except the joke of it, because the prospect of the soup made him gay and sportive, he tossed the stone along with the meat into the kettle filled with water."
"Elle ne trouva pas un mot, elle le regarda de toute son âme, d’un dernier et long regard, comme il sautait par la fenêtre, pour rejoindre sa batterie, au pas de course.","She couldn't think of a word, she looked at him with all her soul, with one last long look, as he jumped out of the window to join his battery at a run.","She could find nothing to say, but put her whole soul into a last long look as he leaped out of the window, racing off to rejoin his battery.","She could find no word to say in answer, but all her soul went out to him in one long, last look, as he leaped from the window and hurried away to find his battery."
"– Eh ! mon brave, fichez-moi la paix ! répondit le général contrarié. Il faudrait en fusiller une douzaine par jour, de ces coquins ! Est-ce qu’on peut ?","– Hey! my good man, leave me alone! answered the annoyed general. We should shoot a dozen of these rascals a day! Can we ?","‘Oh, leave us alone, my good man,’ said the general, irritated. ‘I should have to shoot a dozen of these characters everyday. How can I?’","“Eh! will you hold your tongue, old man!” shouted the general in disgust. “Those rascals ought to be shot at the rate of a dozen a day. What is one to do?”"
Mais une servante venait de paraître.,But a servant had just appeared.,A maid had just come in.,At that moment a servant came to the door.
"– Ah ! oui, foutre ! répondit le lieutenant en agitant ses grands bras. Vous verrez s’il fait chaud, tout à l’heure !","– Ah! yes, fuck! replied the lieutenant, waving his long arms. You'll see if it's hot, just now!","‘Yes, it bloody well is!’ he answered, waving his long arms. ‘You’ll see whether it’s hot enough in a minute.’","Maurice ventured to ask Rochas. “Yes, thank goodness,” replied the Lieutenant, his long arms going like windmills. “Wait a little; you'll find it warm enough!”"
"Mais, à ce moment, il y eut des rires, des cris de fille qu’on force et qui plaisante. C’était le lieutenant Rochas, qui, dans la vieille cuisine enfumée, égayée d’images d’Épinal, tenait entre ses bras la jolie servante, en troupier conquérant. Il parut sous la tonnelle, où il se fit servir un café ; et, comme il avait entendu les dernières paroles de Coutard et de Picot, il intervint gaiement :","But at that moment there was laughter, the cries of a girl being forced and joking. It was Lieutenant Rochas, who, in the smoky old kitchen, enlivened with images of Epinal, held the pretty servant in his arms like a conquering trooper. He appeared under the arbor, where he ordered coffee; and, as he had heard the last words of Coutard and Picot, he cheerfully intervened:","But just then there was a noise of laughing and screaming, of a girl struggling with a man and enjoying the fun. It was Lieutenant Rochas in the old dark kitchen with its gay Epinal prints, and he was holding the pretty waitress in his arms, like a conquering hero. He came out into the arbour, where he had a coffee brought to him, and as he had overheard the last words of Coutard and Picot he gaily chipped in:","But just then there came from the smoke-blackened kitchen, where the walls were bright with the colored prints of Epinal, a sound of voices and the squalling of a girl who submits, not unwillingly, to be tousled. It was Lieutenant Rochas, availing himself of his privilege as a conquering hero, to catch and kiss the pretty waitress. He came out into the arbor, where he ordered a cup of coffee to be served him, and as he had heard the concluding words of Picot's narrative, proceeded to take a hand in the conversation:"
"– Dites donc, capitaine, c’est moi qui vous ai démoli tant de monde, et qu’on me fusille, ça va bien. D’autant plus que je n’ai personne, ni mère, ni femme, ni enfant… Tandis que monsieur est marié… Dites, lâchez-le donc, puis vous me réglerez mon affaire…","“I say, captain, it is I who have demolished so many people for you, and that they shoot me, that is all right. Especially since I have no one, neither mother, nor wife, nor child... While Monsieur is married... Say, let him go, then you will settle my business...","‘I say, captain, I was the one who bumped off so many of your lot, so let me be shot, that’s all right. And what’s more I’ve got nobody, neither mother, wife nor child… But this gentleman is married… So let him go and then you can settle my account.’","“See here, Captain, I am the man who killed so many of your men; go ahead and shoot me—that will be all right, especially as I have neither chick nor child in all the world. But this gentleman's case is different; he is a married man, don't you see. Come, now, let him go; then you can settle my business as soon as you choose.”"
"– Ah ! mon Dieu ! murmura Henriette oppressée, combien de temps tout cela durera-t-il, et le reverrons-nous jamais !","– Ah! my God ! murmured Henriette oppressed, how long will all this last, and will we ever see him again!","‘Oh God!’ murmured Henriette, weighed down by grief. ‘How long is it all going to last, and shall we ever see him again?’","“Ah, merciful heaven!” she murmured, “how long will all this last, and shall we ever see him more!”"
"En effet, le colonel rouvrait les yeux, les fixait sur Delaherche, sans remuer la tête. Il le reconnut, il demanda aussitôt d’une voix que la fièvre faisait trembler :","In fact, the colonel opened his eyes again, fixed them on Delaherche, without moving his head. He recognized him, he immediately asked in a voice trembling with fever:","The colonel was indeed opening his eyes again, and he gazed at Delaherche without moving his head. Then he recognized him and at once asked in a voice weak with fever:","It was so; the colonel, without moving his head, had reopened his eyes and bent them on Delaherche. He recognized him, and immediately asked in a voice that his exhausted condition made tremulous:"
"Une douleur croissante serrait le cœur d’Henriette, à l’étouffer, devant l’immensité de la catastrophe. Pendant quelques minutes, son malheur personnel disparut, emporté dans cette expiation de tout un peuple. La pensée du feu dévorant des vies humaines, la vue de la ville embrasée à l’horizon, jetant la lueur d’enfer des capitales maudites et foudroyées, lui arrachaient des cris involontaires. Elle joignit les mains, elle demanda :","A growing pain gripped Henriette's heart, suffocating her, faced with the immensity of the catastrophe. For a few minutes, his personal misfortune disappeared, carried away in this expiation of a whole people. The thought of fire devouring human lives, the sight of the city ablaze on the horizon, casting the hellish glow of cursed and blasted capitals, tore involuntary cries from him. She clasped her hands, she asked:","As she took in the immensity of the disaster Henriette felt more and more sick at heart until the pain was unbearable. For a few minutes her own misfortunes vanished, carried away in this expiation of a whole nation. The thought of fire devouring human lives, the sight of this blazing city on the horizon, throwing up the hellish glare of cities accursed and destroyed, made her cry out in spite of herself. She clasped her hands together and asked:","It seemed to Henriette as if her heart would break in presence of that dire catastrophe. Her personal grief was lost to sight for some minutes, swallowed up in the great drama of a people's atonement that was being enacted before her eyes. The thought of the lives that would be sacrificed to the devouring flames, the sight of the great capital blazing on the horizon, emitting the infernal light of the cities that were accursed and smitten for their iniquity, elicited from her an involuntary cry of anguish. She clasped her hands, asking:"
"– Nom de Dieu ! remuez-vous ! cria Bouroche aux infirmiers figés de terreur. Lavez-moi la table, apportez-moi le numéro trois !","- For God Sake ! get moving! Bouroche cried to the orderlies frozen with terror. Clean the table, bring me number three!","‘For God’s sake, stir your stumps!’ Bouroche bawled to the orderlies. ‘ Come on, wash down the table and bring me number three!’","“Thunder and lightning! Stir yourselves, will you!” Bouroche shouted to his staff, who were standing about with pallid faces, transfixed by terror. “Wash off the table; go and bring me in number three!”"
"Elle l’avait entraînée dans sa chambre, elle la fit asseoir sur la chaise longue, se serra contre elle.","She had dragged her into her room, she made her sit down on the chaise-longue, pressed herself against her.","She dragged her into her own room, sat her down on the couch and hugged her.","Thus running on she dragged her friend to her bedroom, where she seated her on the lounge and snuggled down close beside her."
"Alors, quand elle vit Bouroche s’approcher avec le couteau mince, Gilberte ne put en supporter davantage.","So when she saw Bouroche approaching with the thin knife, Gilberte couldn't bear it any longer.",When she saw Bouroche drawing near with his narrow knife Gilberte could bear it no longer.,"Gilberte, when she saw Bouroche approach the victim with the glittering steel, could endure no more."
"– Et, dès que je passerai à Remilly, je monterai dire à l’oncle Fouchard que je vous ai vu et que vous vous portez bien.","“And, as soon as I pass Remilly, I will go upstairs to tell Uncle Fouchard that I have seen you and that you are well.",‘And as I’m going up Remilly way I’ll go and tell Uncle Fouchard I’ve seen you and you are all right.’,"“The first time I am anywhere in the neighborhood,” he said, “I will run up to Remilly and tell Uncle Fouchard that I saw you and that you are well.”"
"– Seigneur, prenez pitié de lui…","“Lord, have mercy on him…","‘Lord, have mercy upon him…’","“Merciful God, have pity on him. Let him, good Lord, depart in peace—”"

"Il ne criait pas, il ne s’exaltait pas, et l’énormité de sa joie tranquille terrifiait Henriette. Ah ! ces Prussiens qui voyaient ça ! Elle le sentait insultant par son calme, par son demi-sourire, comme s’il avait prévu et attendu depuis longtemps ce désastre sans exemple. Enfin, Paris brûlait, Paris dont les obus allemands n’avaient pu qu’écorner les gouttières ! Toutes ses rancunes se trouvaient satisfaites, il semblait vengé de la longueur démesurée du siège, des froids terribles, des difficultés sans cesse renaissantes, dont l’Allemagne gardait encore l’irritation. Dans l’orgueil du triomphe, les provinces conquises, l’indemnité des cinq milliards, rien ne valait ce spectacle de Paris détruit, frappé de folie furieuse, s’incendiant lui-même et s’envolant en fumée, par cette claire nuit de printemps.","He was not shouting, he was not exulting, and the enormity of his quiet joy terrified Henrietta. Ah! those Prussians who saw that! She felt him insulting by his calmness, by his half-smile, as if he had foreseen and waited a long time for this unprecedented disaster. Finally, Paris was burning, Paris whose German shells had only been able to scratch the gutters! All his grudges were satisfied, he seemed avenged for the inordinate length of the siege, the terrible cold, the constantly recurring difficulties, from which Germany still retained the irritation. In the pride of triumph, the provinces conquered, the indemnity of five billion, nothing was worth this spectacle of Paris destroyed, stricken with furious madness, setting itself on fire and flying away in smoke, on this clear night of spring.","He was not shouting or getting excited, but the outrageousness of his quiet joy terrified Henriette. Oh, these Prussians who could watch this! She felt the insult of his calm, faint smile, as though he had foreseen this unparalleled disaster and had been waiting for it for a long time. At last Paris was burning down, Paris where German shells had only succeeded in knocking off a few gutters. All his rancour was satisfied and he seemed avenged for the endless siege, the terrible cold and the ever renewed difficulties which still rankled with Germany. In the triumph of their pride the conquered provinces, the indemnity of five milliards, none of it was as good as this spectacle of Paris destroyed, gone raving mad and setting fire to herself and going up in smoke on this clear spring night.","He did not raise his voice or manifest any sign of feeling, and it froze Henriette's blood that a human being could stand by and witness such a spectacle unmoved. Ah, that those Prussians should be there to see that sight! She saw an insult in his studied calmness, in the faint smile that played upon his lips, as if he had long foreseen and been watching for that unparalleled disaster. So, Paris was burning then at last, Paris, upon whose monuments the German shells had scarce been able to inflict more than a scratch! and he was there to see it burn, and in the spectacle found compensation for all his grievances, the inordinate length to which the siege had been protracted, the bitter, freezing weather, the difficulties they had surmounted only to see them present themselves anew under some other shape, the toil and trouble they had had in mounting their heavy guns, while all the time Germany from behind was reproaching them with their dilatoriness. Nothing in all the glory of their victory, neither the ceded provinces nor the indemnity of five milliards, appealed to him so strongly as did that sight of Paris, in a fit of furious madness, immolating herself and going up in smoke and flame on that beautiful spring night."
– Je crois bien que non !,- I think not!,‘Afraid not.’,“I should say not!”
"– Ah ! pour ce qu’on nous les a montrés, ça ne vaut guère la peine !… Puisque ça n’est plus bon à rien, la cavalerie, qu’à se faire tuer quand tout est fini, pourquoi voulez-vous que je retourne là-bas ?… Ma foi, non ! ils m’ont trop embêté, à ne rien me faire faire de propre !","– Ah! for what they were shown to us, it's hardly worth the trouble!… Since cavalry is no longer good for anything except getting killed when it's all over, why do you want me to go back there? - low?... Well, no! they bothered me too much, not making me do anything proper!","‘Well, from what we’ve seen of them it’s not much use… Since the cavalry is no good for anything except to get killed after it’s all over, what do you want me to go back for? Oh no , I’ve got so fed up with them never giving me anything worth doing!’","“It don't strike me that it is worth while, from what we were allowed to see of them before. Why should you wish me to go back there, when the only use our generals can find for the cavalry is to send it in after the battle is ended and let it be cut to pieces? No, faith, I'm sick of the business, giving us such dirty work as that to do!”"
"Mais, à Balan, un régiment d’infanterie de marine barrait la route. C’était une masse compacte d’hommes attendant des ordres, à l’abri des grands arbres qui les cachaient. Elle se haussa sur les pieds, n’en vit pas la fin. Cependant, elle essaya de se faire plus petite encore, de se faufiler. Des coudes la repoussaient, elle sentait dans ses flancs les crosses des fusils. Au bout de vingt pas, des cris, des protestations s’élevèrent. Un capitaine tourna la tête et s’emporta.","But, at Balan, a regiment of marine infantry blocked the way. It was a compact mass of men awaiting orders, sheltered by the tall trees that hid them. She rose to her feet, saw no end. However, she tried to make herself even smaller, to squeeze in. Elbows pushed her back, she felt the butts of rifles in her sides. After twenty steps, cries and protests arose. A captain turned his head and lost his temper.","But in Balan itself there was a regiment of marines blocking the road, a solid mass of men waiting for orders in the shade of the big trees which concealed them. She stood on tiptoe but could not see the end of them. Yet she tried to make herself smaller still and wriggle through. Elbows shoved her away and she felt rifle-butts sticking into her. She had done some twenty steps when there were shouts and protests. A captain turned round and let fly at her:","At Balan, however, she found the road blocked by a regiment of infanterie de marine. It was a compact mass of men, drawn up under the tall trees that concealed them from the enemy's observation, awaiting orders. She raised herself on tiptoe, and could not see the end; still, she made herself as small as she could and attempted to worm her way through. The men shoved her with their elbows, and the butts of their muskets made acquaintance with her ribs; when she had advanced a dozen paces there was a chorus of shouts and angry protests. A captain turned on her and roughly cried:"
"– Écoute, mon petit, dit alors le caporal, tu ne vas pas me quitter, parce que, vois-tu, il faut savoir, si l’on ne veut pas attraper de mauvais coups… Moi, j’ai déjà vu ça, j’ouvrirai l’œil pour toi et pour moi.","- Listen, my child, then said the corporal, you're not going to leave me, because, you see, you have to know, if you don't want to get bad shots... Me, I've already seen that, I will open my eyes for you and for me.","‘Look here chum,’ the corporal said, ‘you and I aren’t going to get separated because, you see, you’ve got to have the know-how if you don’t want to land in trouble. I’ve already been through all this, and I’ll keep my eyes open for you as well as myself.’","“Look here, youngster,” said the corporal, “you are going to stick close by me to-day, for unless a man has his wits about him , don't you see, he is likely to get in trouble. Now, I have been there before, and can keep an eye out for both of us.”"
"Il fallut retenir Rochas, qui parlait de lui casser la tête. D’ailleurs, Loubet lui-même, avec ses bouteilles dans les bras, s’efforçait de mettre la paix.","We had to restrain Rochas, who was talking about breaking his head. Besides, Loubet himself, with his bottles in his arms, tried to bring peace.","They had to hold back Rochas, who was threatening to do him in. Loubet, of all people, bottle in hand, was trying to keep the peace.","The others had to restrain the lieutenant to keep him from assaulting the socialist. Loubet himself, dandling his bottles affectionately in his arms, did what he could to pour oil upon the troubled waters."
"– Mais à la Sous-Préfecture, pour savoir si l’empereur se moque de nous, quand il parle de faire hisser le drapeau blanc.","“But to the Sub-Prefecture, to find out if the Emperor is making fun of us when he talks about raising the white flag.","‘The Sub-Prefecture, of course, to find out whether the Emperor is having us on when he talks about running up the white flag.’","“Why, to the Sous-Prefecture, to see what the Emperor means by fooling us in this way, with his talk of hoisting the white flag.”"
"Il continua, de son air raisonnable, il expliqua ses craintes : la Prusse grandie après Sadowa, le mouvement national qui la plaçait à la tête des autres États allemands, tout ce vaste empire en formation, rajeuni, ayant l’enthousiasme et l’irrésistible élan de son unité à conquérir ; le système du service militaire obligatoire, qui mettait debout la nation en armes, instruite, disciplinée, pourvue d’un matériel puissant, rompue à la grande guerre, encore glorieuse de son triomphe foudroyant sur l’Autriche ; l’intelligence, la force morale de cette armée, commandée par des chefs presque tous jeunes, obéissant à un généralissime qui semblait devoir renouveler l’art de se battre, d’une prudence et d’une prévoyance parfaites, d’une netteté de vue merveilleuse. Et, en face de cette Allemagne, il osa ensuite montrer la France : l’Empire vieilli, acclamé encore au plébiscite, mais pourri à la base, ayant affaibli l’idée de patrie en détruisant la liberté, redevenu libéral trop tard et pour sa ruine, prêt à crouler dès qu’il ne satisferait plus les appétits de jouissances déchaînés par lui ; l’armée, certes, d’une admirable bravoure de race, toute chargée des lauriers de Crimée et d’Italie, seulement gâtée par le remplacement à prix d’argent, laissée dans sa routine de l’école d’Afrique, trop certaine de la victoire pour tenter le grand effort de la science nouvelle ; les généraux enfin, médiocres pour la plupart, dévorés de rivalités, quelques-uns d’une ignorance stupéfiante, et l’empereur à leur tête, souffrant et hésitant, trompé et se trompant, dans l’effroyable aventure qui commençait, où tous se jetaient en aveugles, sans préparation sérieuse, au milieu d’un effarement, d’une débandade de troupeau mené à l’abattoir.","He continued, with his reasonable air, he explained his fears: Prussia growing after Sadowa, the national movement which placed it at the head of the other German states, all this vast empire in formation, rejuvenated, having the enthusiasm and the irresistible momentum of his unity to conquer; the system of compulsory military service, which put the nation on its feet in arms, educated, disciplined, equipped with powerful equipment, experienced in the great war, still glorious from its overwhelming triumph over Austria; the intelligence, the moral force of this army, commanded by chiefs almost all young, obeying a generalissimo who seemed to have to renew the art of fighting, with perfect prudence and foresight, with a clearness of marvelous view. And, facing this Germany, he then dared to show France: the aged Empire, still acclaimed in the plebiscite, but rotten at the base, having weakened the idea of fatherland by destroying freedom, having become liberal again too late and for its ruin, ready to crumble as soon as he no longer satisfies the appetites for enjoyment unleashed by him; the army, certainly, of admirable racial bravery, laden with the laurels of Crimea and Italy, only spoiled by the replacement at a price of money, left in its routine of the school of Africa, too certain of victory to attempt the great effort of the new science; finally the generals, mediocre for the most part, devoured by rivalries, some of a stupefying ignorance, and the emperor at their head, suffering and hesitating, deceived and mistaken, in the terrible adventure which was beginning, where all cast blind, without serious preparation, in the midst of a bewilderment, a stampede of herds led to the slaughterhouse.","He proceeded in his reasonable way to explain his fears: the growth of Prussia after Sadowa, the nationalist movement which put her at the head of the other German states, a great empire in formation, rejuvenated with the enthusiasm and irresistible impetus to achieve its unity; the system of compulsory military service which set up a whole nation in arms, trained, disciplined and with powerful weapons, ready for a long war and still intoxicated with her shattering triumph over Austria; the intelligence and moral strength of this ‘army, under the command of officers almost all young and obeying a commander-in-chief who seemed about to modernize the whole art of war, a man of incomparable prudence and foresight and miraculous clarity of vision. And with that Germany he had the courage to contrast France: the Empire grown old, still acclaimed in a plebiscite but basically rotten because it had weakened the idea of patriotism by destroying liberty, and then turning back to liberalism too late and thereby hastening its own undoing because it was ready to collapse as soon as it stopped satisfying the lust for pleasure it had let loose; the army certainly admirable as a brave lot of men, and still wearing the laurels of the Crimea and Italy, but adulterated by the system of paid substitutes, still in the old routine of the Africa school, too cocksure of victory to face the great effort of modern techniques; and then the generals, most of them nonentities and eaten up with rivalries and some of them quite stupefyingly ignorant, and at their head the Emperor, a sick man and vacillating, deceived and self-deceiving, and all facing this terrible adventure into which they were blindly hurling themselves, with no serious preparation, like a stampede of scared sheep being led to the slaughter.","And he went on in his clear, demonstrative way to explain the reason of his fears: how Prussia had increased her resources since Sadowa; how the national movement had placed her at the head of the other German states, a mighty empire in process of formation and rejuvenation, with the constant hope and desire for unity as the incentive to their irresistible efforts; the system of compulsory military service, which made them a nation of trained soldiers, provided with the most effective arms of modern invention, with generals who were masters in the art of strategy, proudly mindful still of the crushing defeat they had administered to Austria; the intelligence, the moral force that resided in that army, commanded as it was almost exclusively by young generals, who in turn looked up to a commander-in-chief who seemed destined to revolutionize the art of war, whose prudence and foresight were unparalleled, whose correctness of judgment was a thing to wonder at. And in contrast to that picture of Germany he pointed to France: the Empire sinking into senile decrepitude, sanctioned by the plebiscite, but rotten at its foundation, destroying liberty, and therein stifling every idea of patriotism, ready to give up the ghost as soon as it should cease to satisfy the unworthy appetites to which it had given birth; then there was the army, brave, it was true, as was to be expected from men of their race, and covered with Crimean and Italian laurels, but vitiated by the system that permitted men to purchase substitutes for a money consideration, abandoned to the antiquated methods of African routine, too confident of victory to keep abreast with the more perfect science of modern times; and, finally, the generals, men for the most part not above mediocrity, consumed by petty rivalries, some of them of an ignorance beyond all belief, and at their head the Emperor, an ailing, vacillating man, deceiving himself and everyone with whom he had dealings in that desperate venture on which they were embarking, into which they were all rushing blindfold, with no preparation worthy of the name, with the panic and confusion of a flock of sheep on its way to the shambles."
"– Nom de Dieu ! dit-il enfin, faudrait savoir… Moi, je m’en fous d’ailleurs !","- For God Sake ! he said finally, you should know… Me, I don't care anyway!",‘Good God!’ he said. ‘So long as we know… For my part I don’t give a damn anyway!’,"“Nom de Dieu!” he at last succeeded in ejaculating, “one would like to know— But it is no business of mine, anyhow.”"

And don't think I say it to find fault, but really you are not so light as you were when you were a boy.”"
"– Écoute, ma chère, je n’ai pas la force de te gronder, et pourtant tu sais si je te blâme ! Mais on m’avait fait une telle peur avec ton Prussien, j’ai redouté des choses si laides, que l’autre histoire, ma foi ! est un soulagement… Calme-toi, tout peut s’arranger.","“Listen, my dear, I haven’t the strength to scold you, and yet you know if I blame you!

But I had been given such a scare over your Prussian, and had dreaded such nasty things that this other affair is really a relief… Cheer up, it will all work out.’","“Listen, my dear; I cannot bring myself to scold you, and yet you know what my sentiments must be. But I was so alarmed by the stories I heard about the Prussian, the business wore such an extremely ugly aspect, that this affair really comes to me as a sort of relief by comparison. Cease weeping; things may come out all right.”"

"Un hasard fit alors que Maurice reconnut Prosper, qui avait poussé son cheval au bord d’une mare ; et ils purent causer un instant. Le chasseur paraissait étourdi, hébété, ne sachant rien, n’ayant rien vu depuis Reims : si pourtant, il avait vu deux uhlans encore, des bougres qui apparaissaient, qui disparaissaient, sans qu’on sût d’où ils sortaient ni où ils rentraient. Déjà, on contait des histoires, quatre uhlans entrant au galop dans une ville, le revolver au poing, la traversant, la conquérant, à vingt kilomètres de leur corps d’armée. Ils étaient partout, ils précédaient les colonnes d’un bourdonnement d’abeilles, mouvant rideau derrière lequel l’infanterie dissimulait ses mouvements, marchait en toute sécurité, comme en temps de paix. Et Maurice eut un grand serrement au cœur, en regardant la route encombrée de chasseurs et de hussards, qu’on utilisait si mal.","By chance Maurice recognized Prosper, who had pushed his horse to the edge of a pond; and they were able to talk for a moment. The hunter seemed dazed, dazed, knowing nothing, having seen nothing since Reims: if, however, he had seen two more uhlans, buggers who appeared, who disappeared, without anyone knowing where they came from or where they were returning. Already, stories were being told of four Uhlans galloping into a city, revolver in hand, crossing it, conquering it, twenty kilometers from their army corps. They were everywhere, they preceded the columns with a buzz of bees, a moving curtain behind which the infantry concealed their movements, marched in complete safety, as in peacetime. And Maurice had a great pang in his heart, looking at the road encumbered with chasseurs and hussars, which was being used so badly.","By sheer chance Maurice caught sight of Prosper, who had taken his horse to a pond, and they could talk for a moment. He seemed quite lost and dazed, knowing nothing and having seen nothing since Rheims. Oh, but yes, he had seen two Uhlans, chaps who appeared and disappeared and nobody knew where they came from or where they went. Stories were already going round about four Uhlans galloping into a town with revolvers in their hands, dashing through it, conquering it, and twenty kilometres away from their own army corps at that. They were everywhere, they preceded the enemy columns like a swarm of buzzing bees, a moving curtain behind which the infantry could disguise its movements, marching with complete security as in peace time. Maurice felt sick at heart as he saw the road jammed with cavalry and hussars being so badly employed.","A squadron of chasseurs d'Afrique were halted for near two hours at the gate of Vouziers, and by the merest chance Maurice stumbled on Prosper, who had ridden his horse down to the bank of a neighboring pond to let him drink, and the two men were enabled to exchange a few words. The chasseur appeared stunned, dazed, knew nothing and had seen nothing since they left Rheims; yes, though, he had: he had seen two uhlans more; oh! but they were will o' the wisps, phantoms , they were, that appeared and vanished, and no one could tell whence they came nor whither they went. Their fame had spread, and stories of them were already rife throughout the country, such, for instance, as that of four uhlans galloping into a town with drawn revolvers and taking possession of it, when the corps to which they belonged was a dozen miles away. They were everywhere, preceding the columns like a buzzing, stinging swarm of bees, a living curtain, behind which the infantry could mask their movements and march and countermarch as securely as if they were at home upon parade. And Maurice's heart sank in his bosom as he looked at the road, crowded with chasseurs and hussars which our leaders put to such poor use."
"– Mais c’est certain, caporal, dit-il gaiement, nous les rosserons !","- But it is certain, corporal, he said cheerfully, we will thrash them!","‘Yes, that’s a fact, corporal,’ he said perkily. ‘We’ll give them what for!’","“Why, of course, Corporal,” he gayly replied, “we shall give them a basting!”"
"– Eh bien ! mon garçon, puisque tu es si gentil, nous boirons un coup.","- Well ! Boy, since you're so nice, we'll have a drink.","All the same, as he was coming very civilly it would be best to be polite in return. ‘Well, my boy, as you are so kind we must have a drink.’","First of all, however, it would be best to treat him politely, as he seemed to have come there in a friendly spirit. “Well, my lad, since you are so pleasant we'll have a glass together for old times' sake.”"
"Le malheur voulut que Pache, buttant contre une pierre, s’abattit. Déjà les trois autres arrivaient, jurant, hurlant, fouettés par la course, pareils à des loups lâchés sur une proie.","Unfortunately, Pache, stumbling against a stone, fell down. Already the three others were arriving, swearing, howling, whipped by the race, like wolves unleashed on a prey.","As ill-luck would have it Pache tripped over a stone and went down. Already the three others had caught up, swearing, yelling and worked up by the chase, like a pack of wolves let loose on their prey.","As luck would have it, Pache tripped over a stone and fell. In an instant the others were on top of him—shouting, swearing, their passion roused to such a pitch of frenzy that they were like wolves that had run down their prey."
"Un homme encore venait d’avoir la tête emportée, deux chevaux d’un caisson râlaient, le ventre ouvert, et le tir ennemi continuait, tellement meurtrier, que la batterie entière allait être démontée, si l’on s’entêtait sur la même position. Il fallait dérouter ce tir terrible, malgré les inconvénients d’un changement de place. Le capitaine n’hésita plus, cria l’ordre :","Another man had just had his head blown off, two horses in a caisson were groaning, their bellies open, and the enemy fire continued, so deadly that the entire battery was going to be dismantled if they persisted in the same way. position. It was necessary to reroute this terrible shot, despite the inconvenience of a change of place. The captain hesitated no longer, shouted the order:","Yet another man had had his head blown off, two of the horses on one van were agonizing with their bellies ripped open, and the enemy was keeping up such a murderous fire that the whole battery was going to be put out of action if they hung on to the same position. This terrible bombardment must be foiled in spite of the difficulties of a change of position. Without further hesitation the captain called out the order:","Another man had been killed, two horses of a caisson had been disemboweled, and the enemy kept up such a murderous fire that there was a prospect of the entire battery being knocked to pieces should they persist in holding that position longer. It was time to take some step to baffle that tremendous fire, notwithstanding the danger there was in moving, and the captain unhesitatingly gave orders to bring up the limbers."
"Mais un coin des vastes bâtiments de la fabrique, surtout, restait clos, comme inhabité : c’était, sur la rue, à l’extrémité des appartements de maître, la chambre que le colonel de Vineuil habitait toujours. Tandis que les autres fenêtres s’ouvraient, laissaient passer tout un va-et-vient, tout un bruit de vie, celles de cette pièce semblaient mortes, avec leurs persiennes obstinément fermées. Le colonel s’était plaint de ses yeux, dont la grande lumière avivait les souffrances, disait-il ; et l’on ne savait s’il mentait, on entretenait près de lui une lampe, nuit et jour, pour le contenter. Pendant deux longs mois, il avait dû garder le lit, bien que le major Bouroche n’eût diagnostiqué qu’une fêlure de la cheville : la plaie ne se fermait pas, toutes sortes de complications étaient survenues. Maintenant, il se levait, mais dans un tel accablement moral, en proie à un mal indéfini, si têtu, si envahissant, qu’il vivait ses journées étendu sur une chaise longue, devant un grand feu de bois. Il maigrissait, devenait une ombre, sans que le médecin qui le soignait, très surpris, pût trouver une lésion, la cause de cette mort lente. Ainsi qu’une flamme, il s’éteignait.","But one corner of the vast factory buildings, above all, remained closed off, as if uninhabited: it was, on the street, at the end of the master's apartments, the room in which Colonel de Vineuil still lived. While the other windows opened, letting in a whole coming and going, a whole noise of life, those in this room seemed dead, with their blinds stubbornly closed. The colonel had complained of his eyes, the bright light of which heightened the suffering, he said; and no one knew if he was lying, they kept a lamp near him, night and day, to satisfy him. For two long months he had to stay in bed, although Major Bouroche had only diagnosed a crack in his ankle: the wound was not closing, all sorts of complications had arisen. Now he got up, but in such a moral depression, prey to an indefinite illness, so stubborn, so pervasive, that he spent his days stretched out on a chaise-longue, in front of a big wood fire. He was losing weight, becoming a shadow, without the doctor who was treating him, very surprised, being able to find a lesion, the cause of this slow death. Like a flame, it was extinguished.","But one corner of the great factory block remained shut up and looked uninhabited – the room looking on to the road at one end of the proprietor’s quarters, where Colonel de Vineuil was still living. Whereas the other windows were open and revealed quite a lot of activity and bustle of life, the windows of this room seemed dead, with their blinds obstinately closed. The colonel had complained about his eyes and said that strong light made them hurt. Nobody knew whether it was true or not, but a lamp was kept burning in his room night and day to humour him. He had had to stay in bed for two whole months, although all Major Bouroche had diagnosed was a cracked ankle-bone, but the wound would not heal and all sorts of complications had developed. Now he did get up, but he was in such a state of dejection, afflicted by some indefinable ill which was so intractable and all-pervading that he spent his days lying on a couch in front of a big wood fire. He was losing weight and becoming a wraith, and the doctor who attended him was very puzzled because he could find nothing wrong, no reason for this slow death. He was flickering out like a flame.","There was one corner, however, of the immense structure that was always closed, as if it had no occupant: it was the chamber that Colonel de Vineuil still continued to inhabit, at the extreme end of the suite where the master and his family spent their daily life. While the other windows were thrown open, affording evidence by sight and sound of the activity that prevailed within, those of that room were dark and lifeless, their blinds invariably drawn. The colonel had complained that the daylight hurt his eyes; no one knew whether or not this was strictly true, but a lamp was kept burning at his bedside day and night to humor him in his fancy. For two long months he had kept his bed, although Major Bouroche asserted there was nothing more serious than a contusion of the ankle and a fragment of bone chipped away; the wound refused to heal and complications of various kinds had ensued. He was able to get up now, but was in such a state of utter mental prostration, his mysterious ailment had taken such firm hold upon his system, that he was content to spend his days in idleness, stretched on a lounge before a great wood fire. He had wasted away until he was little more than a shadow, and still the physician who was attending him could find no lesion to account for that lingering death. He was slowly fading away, like the flame of a lamp in which the supply of oil is giving out. Mme."
"– Oh ! madame, que vous seriez bonne d’intervenir !… Mon oncle est dans une position terrible, on parle de l’envoyer en Allemagne.","- Oh ! madame, how good you would be to intervene!

It is exactly like the colored plate I have at home, and then the photograph that Cousin Gunther sent us—” She stopped suddenly, and with her unconcerned, fearless air, before anyone could make a motion to detain her, walked up to the corpse, bent down and read the number of the regiment."
"Elle le faisait taire, lui mettait la main sur la bouche, lorsque Delaherche entra, bouleversé, hors de lui. Il avait fini par descendre de la terrasse, repris d’une fringale, d’une de ces faims nerveuses, que la fatigue exaspère ; et, comme il était retourné dans la cuisine pour boire quelque chose de chaud, il venait de trouver là, avec la cuisinière, un parent à elle, un menuisier de Bazeilles, à qui elle servait justement du vin chaud. Alors, cet homme, un des derniers habitants restés là-bas, au milieu des incendies, lui avait conté que sa teinturerie était absolument détruite, un tas de décombres.","She was making him shut up, putting her hand over his mouth, when Delaherche came in, upset, out of his mind. He had finally descended from the terrace, seized with a craving, with one of those nervous hungers which fatigue exasperates; and, as he had returned to the kitchen to drink something hot, he had just found there, with the cook, a relative of hers, a carpenter from Bazeilles, to whom she was just serving mulled wine. So this man, one of the last inhabitants left there, in the midst of the fires, had told him that his dyeing plant was absolutely destroyed, a pile of rubble.","She stopped him by putting her hand on his mouth, and at that moment Delaherche came in, almost out of his mind with exhaustion. He had finally come down from the roof, ravenous again with one of those nervous hungers made worse still by fatigue, and as he had gone back to the kitchen to get something warm to drink he had come upon the cook with a relation of hers, a carpenter from Bazeilles, whom she was giving some mulled wine. And this man, one of the last to stay behind in the midst of the fires, had told him that his dyeworks was completely destroyed, a heap of rubble.","She was silencing him, placing her hand upon his mouth, when Delaherche came into the room, beside himself with indignation. While still on the terrace he had been seized by one of those uncontrollable nervous fits of hunger that are aggravated by fatigue, and had descended to the kitchen in quest of something warm to drink, where he had found, keeping company with his cook, a relative of hers, a carpenter of Bazeilles, whom she was in the act of treating to a bowl of hot wine. This person, who had been one of the last to leave the place while the conflagrations were at their height, had told him that his dyehouse was utterly destroyed, nothing left of it but a heap of ruins."

"Mais la compagnie Beaudoin les avait vus, et elle les voyait toujours là. Les chassepots étaient partis d’eux-mêmes. Maurice, le premier, déchargea le sien. Jean, Pache, Lapoulle, tous les autres l’imitèrent. Il n’y avait pas eu d’ordre, le capitaine voulut arrêter le feu ; et il ne céda que sur un grand geste de Rochas, disant la nécessité de ce soulagement. Enfin, on tirait donc, on employait donc ces cartouches qu’on promenait depuis plus d’un mois, sans en brûler une seule ! Maurice surtout en était ragaillardi, occupant sa peur, s’étourdissant des détonations. La lisière du bois restait morne, pas une feuille ne bougeait, pas un Prussien n’avait reparu ; et l’on tirait toujours sur les arbres immobiles.","But the Beaudoin company had seen them, and they always saw them there. The Chassepots had left on their own. Maurice was the first to unload his. Jean, Pache, Lapoulle, all the others imitated him. There had been no order, the captain wanted to stop the fire; and he yielded only on a grand gesture from Rochas, expressing the necessity of this relief. Finally, we fired, we used these cartridges that we had been walking around for more than a month, without burning a single one! Maurice especially was cheered up by it, occupying his fear, deafening himself with the explosions. The edge of the wood remained dull, not a leaf stirred, not a Prussian had reappeared; and they were still shooting at the motionless trees.","But the Beaudoin company had spotted them and could still see them there. Rifles had gone off of their own accord. Maurice was the first to fire his, and Jean, Pache, Lapoulle and all the others followed. No order had been given, and the captain wanted to stop the firing and only gave in when Rochas waved his arm indicating that the men needed this relief. So at last they were firing, they were using this ammunition they had been carting round for over a month without ever letting any off! Maurice above all was heartened, with something to do for his fear, intoxicating himself with detonations. The edge of the wood looked dreary and not a leaf stirred, nor had a single Prussian reappeared. They were firing all the time at motionless trees.","But Beaudoin's company had seen them there once, and to their eyes they were there still; the chassepots seemed to go off of their own accord. Maurice was the first man to discharge his piece; Jean, Pache, Lapoulle and the others all followed suit. There had been no order given to commence firing, and the captain made an attempt to check it, but desisted upon Rochas's representation that it was absolutely necessary as a measure of relief for the men's pent-up feelings. So, then, they were at liberty to shoot at last, they could use up those cartridges that they had been lugging around with them for the last month, without ever burning a single one! The effect on Maurice in particular was electrical; the noise he made had the effect of dispelling his fear and blunting the keenness of his sensations. The little wood had resumed its former deserted aspect; not a leaf stirred, no more Prussians showed themselves; and still they kept on blazing away as madly as ever at the immovable trees."

"Pache et Lapoulle, qui écoutaient, serraient les poings, en hochant furieusement la tête. D’autres, aussi, se fâchaient, car l’effet de ces continuels mensonges des journaux avait fini par être désastreux. Toute confiance était morte, on ne croyait plus à rien. L’imagination de ces grands enfants, si fertile d’abord en espérances extraordinaires, tombait maintenant à des cauchemars fous.","Pache and Lapoulle, who were listening, clenched their fists, shaking their heads furiously. Others, too, became angry, for the effect of these continual lies from the newspapers had ended up being disastrous. All confidence was dead, we no longer believed in anything. The imagination of these grown-up children, so fertile at first in extraordinary hopes, now fell into wild nightmares.","Pache and Lapoulle listened and clenched their fists, nodding furiously. And others were getting worked up too, for the final effect of these continuous lies in the papers was disastrous. The men had lost all confidence and no longer believed anything. The imaginings of these overgrown children, at first so fertile in wild hopes, were now collapsing into wild nightmares.","Pache and Lapoulle, who were standing near, shook their heads and clenched their fists ominously. There were others, also, who made no attempt to conceal their anger, for the course of the newspapers in constantly printing bogus news had had most disastrous results; all confidence was destroyed, men had ceased to believe anything or anybody. And so it was that in the soldiers, children of a larger growth, their bright dreams of other days had now been supplanted by exaggerated anticipations of misfortune."
"Le 23 août, un mardi, à six heures du matin, le camp fut levé, les cent mille hommes de l’armée de Châlons s’ébranlèrent, coulèrent bientôt en un ruissellement immense, comme un fleuve d’hommes, un instant épandu en lac, qui reprend son cours ; et, malgré les rumeurs qui avaient couru la veille, ce fut une grande surprise pour beaucoup, de voir qu’au lieu de continuer le mouvement de retraite, on tournait le dos à Paris, allant là-bas, vers l’est, à l’inconnu.","On August 23, a Tuesday, at six o'clock in the morning, the camp was broken up, the hundred thousand men of the Army of Châlons set off, soon flowed in an immense stream, like a river of men, lake, which resumes its course; and, in spite of the rumors which had circulated the day before, it was a great surprise for many to see that instead of continuing the movement of retreat, they were turning their backs on Paris, going there, towards the east, to the unknown.","ON 23 August, a Tuesday, at six in the morning, camp was struck and a hundred thousand men of the army of Châlons were on the move and soon flowing in an immense stream, a river of men momentarily spreading out into a lake and then resuming its course. In spite of yesterday’s rumours it came as a great surprise to many of them that instead of continuing the retreat they were turning their backs on Paris and going somewhere eastwards into the unknown.","On Tuesday, the 23d of August, at six o'clock in the morning, camp was broken, and as a stream that has momentarily expanded into a lake resumes its course again, the hundred and odd thousand men of the army of Chalons put themselves in motion and soon were pouring onward in a resistless torrent; and notwithstanding the rumors that had been current since the preceding day, it was a great surprise to most to see that instead of continuing their retrograde movement they were leaving Paris behind them and turning their faces toward the unknown regions of the East."
"– Où l’on se bat ? c’est à Bazeilles qu’on se bat depuis ce matin !… Un soldat à cheval est venu le dire au maréchal, qui tout de suite s’est rendu chez l’empereur, pour l’avertir… Voici dix minutes déjà que le maréchal est parti, et je crois bien que l’empereur va le rejoindre, car on l’habille, là-haut… Je viens de voir à l’instant qu’on le peignait et qu’on le bichonnait, avec toutes sortes d’histoires sur la figure.","- Where are we fighting? it's at Bazeilles that we've been fighting since this morning!... A soldier on horseback came to tell the Marshal, who immediately went to the Emperor, to warn him... Ten minutes already since the Marshal has left, and I believe the Emperor is going to join him, because they dress him up there... I just saw that they were combing and pampering him, with all sorts of clothes. stories on the figure.","‘Where the fighting is? At Bazeilles, they’ve been fighting there since first thing. A soldier on horseback came to report it to the marshal who went straight to the Emperor to warn him… It’s already ten minutes since the marshal went off, and I think the Emperor must be joining him because up there they’re dressing him… I saw just now they were combing his hair and dolling him up with all sorts of stuff on his face.’","The fighting? there has been fighting at Bazeilles this morning. A mounted officer brought word of it to the marshal, who went immediately to notify the Emperor. The marshal has been gone ten minutes, and I shouldn't wonder if the Emperor intends to follow him, for they are dressing him upstairs. I just now saw them combing him and plastering his face with all sorts of cosmetics.”"
"Et elle le serra éperdument dans ses bras, à son cou, tandis qu’Honoré, livide, constatait l’extraordinaire ressemblance de Charlot avec Goliath : c’était la même tête carrée et blonde, toute la race germanique, dans une belle santé d’enfance, souriante et fraîche. Le fils du Prussien, le Prussien, comme les farceurs de Remilly le nommaient ! Et cette mère française qui était là, à l’étreindre sur son cœur, encore toute bouleversée, toute saignante du spectacle de l’invasion !","And she hugged him wildly in her arms, around her neck, while Honoré, livid, noted the extraordinary resemblance between Charlot and Goliath: it was the same square, blond head, the whole Germanic race, in the beautiful health of childhood, smiling and fresh. The son of the Prussian, the Prussian, as the pranksters of Remilly called him! And that French mother who was there, hugging him to her heart, still quite upset, all bleeding from the spectacle of the invasion!","She crushed him wildly in her arms and held him to her, while Honoré, deathly pale, saw the extraordinary likeness between Charlot and Goliath, the same square, blond head, the whole Germanic race in a lovely, healthy child, fresh and smiling. The son of the Prussian, or ‘that Prussian’, as all the jokers in Remilly called him! And here was this French mother holding him to her heart while she was still overwhelmed and haunted by the sight of the invaders!","she exclaimed, and clasped him wildly to her breast, while Honore, ghastly pale, noted how strikingly like the little one was to Goliah; the same broad, pink face, the true Teutonic type, in all the health and strength of rosy, smiling childhood. The son of the Prussian, the Prussian, as the pothouse wits of Remilly had styled him! And the French mother, who sat there, pressing him to her bosom, her heart still bleeding with the recollection of the cruel sights she had witnessed that day!"
"– Mais oui, mon général, le 5e corps s’est battu en se repliant, et il doit être, cette nuit, à Beaumont… Alors, pendant que des camarades sont allés le renseigner sur les mouvements de l’ennemi, nous autres, nous avons eu l’idée de venir vous dire la situation, pour que vous lui portiez secours, car il va avoir sûrement soixante mille hommes sur les bras, demain matin.","“Yes, sir, the 5th Corps fought back, and it must be at Beaumont tonight… So, while some comrades went to inform it of the enemy's movements, the rest of us, we had the idea of coming to tell you the situation, so that you could help him, because he will surely have sixty thousand men on his hands tomorrow morning.","‘There certainly was, sir. The 5th corps was in a battle and withdrew, and it must be at Beaumont tonight… So while some of our comrades have gone to tell them about the enemy movements, we thought we would come and tell you what the situation is so that you can go to their aid, for they are certainly going to be up against sixty thousand men tomorrow morning.’","“Yes, General, the 5th corps was engaged as it was falling back; it must have been at Beaumont last night. So, while some of us hurried off to report to it the movements of the enemy, we thought it best to come and let you know how matters stood, so that you might go to its assistance, for it will certainly have sixty thousand men to deal with in the morning.”"
– Ah ! le bougre ! en voilà un rude lapin ! Mais à quoi bon ? puisqu’on n’a encore su que nous faire patauger dans la boue !,– Ah! the bugger! here is a rough rabbit!

All they could think about was making us paddle about in the mud.’,"“Ah, the bougre! the enemy will catch a Tartar in him! But what's the good talking? the only use they can find for us is to send us pottering about in the mud.”"

"Mais il y eut une diversion. Loubet remarqua que Pache, pendant la querelle, avait, lui aussi, abandonné enfin son fusil, doucement, en le couchant au bas d’un talus. Pourquoi ? Il n’essaya point de l’expliquer, riant en dessous, de la façon gourmande et un peu honteuse d’un garçon sage à qui on reproche son premier péché. Très gai, ragaillardi, il marcha les bras ballants. Et, par les longues routes ensoleillées, entre les blés mûrs et les houblonnières qui se succédaient toujours pareils, la débandade continuait, les traînards n’étaient plus, sans sacs et sans fusils, qu’une foule égarée, piétinante, un pêle-mêle de vauriens et de mendiants, à l’approche desquels les portes des villages épouvantés se fermaient.","But there was a diversion. Loubet noticed that Pache, during the quarrel, had also finally abandoned his gun, gently, laying it down at the bottom of an embankment. Why ? He made no attempt to explain it, laughing to himself, in the greedy and somewhat ashamed manner of a wise boy who is reproached for his first sin. Very cheerful, cheered up, he walked with his arms dangling. And, along the long sunny roads, between the ripe wheat and the hop fields which always followed one another the same, the stampede continued, the stragglers were no longer, without bags and without guns, but a bewildered crowd, trampling, a pell-mell. rascals and beggars, at whose approach the gates of the terrified villages were closed.","But then there was a diversion. Loubet noticed that during the row Pache, too, had quietly got rid of his rifle, putting it down at the foot of a bank. Why? He didn’t attempt to find an explanation, laughing sheepishly, half pleased with himself and half ashamed like a good little boy being scolded for his first naughtiness. He walked along with arms hanging free, very jolly and cock-a-hoop. Along the interminable sun-baked roads, between the fields of ripe corn or hops, one after another and all looking the same, the stampede went on, and the stragglers, with neither packs nor rifles, were nothing but a wandering rabble tramping along, a hotchpotch of rascals and beggars at whose approach village doors shut in panic.","But an incident occurred to divert their thoughts; Loubet noticed that while the dispute was going on Pache had also abandoned his musket, laying it down tenderly at the foot of an embankment. Why? What were the reasons that had made him resist the example of his comrades in the first place, and what were the reasons that influenced him now? He probably could not have told himself, nor did he trouble his head about the matter, chuckling inwardly with silent enjoyment, like a schoolboy who, having long been held up as a model for his mates, commits his first offense. He strode along with a self-contented, rakish air, swinging his arms; and still along the dusty, sunlit roads, between the golden grain and the fields of hops that succeeded one another with tiresome monotony, the human tide kept pouring onward; the stragglers, without arms or knapsacks, were now but a shuffling, vagrant mob, a disorderly array of vagabonds and beggars, at whose approach the frightened villagers barred their doors."
"Delaherche, indigné, intervint. Mais, déjà, l’empereur avait disparu. Le gros bruit de la Meuse continuait, une plainte d’infinie tristesse semblait avoir passé dans l’ombre croissante. D’autres clameurs éparses grondaient au loin. Était-ce le : Marche ! marche ! l’ordre terrible crié de Paris, qui avait poussé cet homme d’étape en étape, traînant par les chemins de la défaite l’ironie de son impériale escorte, acculé maintenant à l’effroyable désastre qu’il prévoyait et qu’il était venu chercher ? Que de braves gens allaient mourir par sa faute, et quel bouleversement de tout l’être, chez ce malade, ce rêveur sentimental, silencieux dans la morne attente de la destinée !","Delaherche, indignant, intervened. But already the Emperor had disappeared. The great noise of the Meuse continued, a complaint of infinite sadness seemed to have passed through the growing darkness. Other scattered shouts rumbled in the distance. Was it the: Walk! walk ! the terrible order shouted from Paris, which had pushed this man from stage to stage, dragging along the paths of defeat the irony of his imperial escort, now driven to the terrible disaster which he foresaw and which he was come looking? How many good people were going to die through his fault, and what an upheaval of the whole being, in this invalid, this sentimental dreamer, silent in the gloomy expectation of destiny!","Delaherche intervened in great indignation. But the Emperor had already disappeared. The loud swash of the Meuse went on and an unspeakably doleful moan seemed to have passed by in the deepening shadows. Other vague sounds could be heard far away. Was it the terrible order: March on! March on! shouted from Paris, which had hounded this man on from stage to stage, dragging the irony of his imperial escort along the roads of defeat until he was now cornered in the frightful disaster he had foreseen and come deliberately to meet? How many decent, ordinary people were about to die through his fault, and what an utter breakdown of this sick man’s whole being, this sentimental dreamer, silent while dully awaiting his doom!","Delaherche remonstrated angrily, but by that time the Emperor had disappeared. The hoarse murmur of the Meuse continued uninterruptedly; a wailing lament, inexpressibly mournful, seemed to pass above them through the air, where the darkness was gathering intensity. Other sounds rose in the distance, like the hollow muttering of the rising storm; were they the “March! march!” that terrible order from Paris that had driven that ill-starred man onward day by day, dragging behind him along the roads of his defeat the irony of his imperial escort, until now he was brought face to face with the ruin he had foreseen and come forth to meet? What multitudes of brave men were to lay down their lives for his mistakes, and how complete the wreck, in all his being, of that sick man, that sentimental dreamer, awaiting in gloomy silence the fulfillment of his destiny!"
"– Je vais mourir, je vais mourir… Ah ! c’est affreux…","“I'm going to die, I'm going to die… Ah! it's horrible…","‘I’m going to die, I’m going to die… Oh it’s awful!’ Then he caught sight of his dirty, torn uniform and black hands and seemed to be embarrassed about being in such a state in front of women.","“I am going to die, I am going to die. Oh! ' tis horrible—”"
"D’un geste de révolte, Jean refusa la cruelle besogne. Cette pauvre bête agonisante, oh ! non, non ! Son premier mouvement venait d’être de fuir, d’emmener Maurice, pour ne prendre part ni l’un ni l’autre à l’affreuse boucherie. Mais, en voyant son compagnon si pâle, il se gronda ensuite de sa sensibilité. Après tout, mon Dieu ! les bêtes, c’était fait pour nourrir les gens. On ne pouvait pas se laisser mourir de faim, quand il y avait là de la viande. Et il fut content de voir Maurice se ragaillardir un peu à l’espoir qu’on dînerait, il dit lui-même de son air de bonne humeur :","With a gesture of revolt, Jean refused the cruel task. This poor dying beast, oh! no no ! His first impulse had just been to flee, to take Maurice away, so that neither of them would take part in the dreadful butchery. But, seeing his companion so pale, he later scolded himself for his sensitivity. After all, my God! animals were made to feed people. You couldn't starve yourself to death when there was meat there. And he was glad to see Maurice perk up a little in the hope that we would have dinner, he said himself in his air of good humor:","With a gesture of disgust Jean refused to do the cruel job. That poor dying creature, oh no, no! His first impulse had been to run away and take Maurice with him so that neither should take part in this horrible butchery. But seeing how ill his friend looked, he reproached himself for being so squeamish. After all, good heavens, that’s what animals are for, to feed men. They couldn’t let themselves die of starvation when there was meat there. He was glad to see Maurice cheering up a little in the hope that they would get a meal, so he said in his good-humoured way:","Jean refused the cruel task with a gesture of disgust. What, kill that poor beast that was even then in its death agony! oh, no, no! His first impulse had been to fly and take Maurice with him, that neither of them might be concerned in the revolting butchery; but looking at his companion and beholding him so pale and faint, he reproached himself for such an excess of sensibility. What were animals created for after all, mon Dieu, unless to afford sustenance to man! They could not allow themselves to starve when there was food within reach. And it rejoiced him to see Maurice cheer up a little at the prospect of eating; he said in his easy, good-natured way:"
"– Parbleu ! cria simplement Rochas, de sa voix de tonnerre.","– Parbleu! cried Rochas simply, in his voice of thunder.","‘There you are!’ was all Rochas exclaimed, in his booming voice.","“Didn't I tell you so!” shouted Rochas, in his most thundering voice."

"– Attends, murmura-t-elle, je crois qu’il t’a entendu, le voici qui se réveille encore.","- Wait, she whispered, I think he heard you, here he is waking up again.","‘Just a minute,’ she murmured, ‘I think he’s heard you, he’s waking up again.’","“I think he must have heard you,” she murmured; “he is awaking again.”"
"Puis, ayant levé la tête, Maurice fut surpris d’apercevoir à quelques pas le colonel de Vineuil, sur son grand cheval, l’homme et la bête impassibles, comme s’ils étaient de pierre. Face à l’ennemi, le colonel attendait sous les balles. Tout le 106e devait s’être replié là, d’autres compagnies étaient terrées dans les champs voisins, la fusillade gagnait de proche en proche. Et le jeune homme vit aussi, un peu en arrière, le drapeau, au bras solide du sous-lieutenant qui le portait. Mais ce n’était plus le fantôme de drapeau, noyé dans le brouillard du matin. Sous le soleil ardent, l’aigle dorée rayonnait, la soie des trois couleurs éclatait en notes vives, malgré l’usure glorieuse des batailles. En plein ciel bleu, au vent de la canonnade, il flottait comme un drapeau de victoire.","Then, having raised his head, Maurice was surprised to see Colonel de Vineuil a few paces away, on his high horse, the man and the beast impassive, as if they were made of stone. Facing the enemy, the colonel was waiting under the bullets. The whole 106th must have fallen back there, other companies were holed up in the neighboring fields, the firefight was gaining step by step. And the young man also saw, a little behind, the flag, on the strong arm of the second lieutenant who carried it. But it was no longer the ghost of a flag, drowned in the morning fog. Under the blazing sun, the golden eagle shone, the silk of the three colors burst into bright notes, despite the glorious wear of battle. In the blue sky, in the wind of the cannonade, it floated like a flag of victory.","Having glanced up, Maurice was surprised to see Colonel de Vineuil a few paces away, on his big horse, man and beast quite undisturbed as though made of stone. With his face to the enemy the colonel waited in the hail of bullets. The whole 106th must have closed in there, other companies were lying in the adjoining fields and the rifle-fire was spreading from one to another. A little to the rear Maurice also saw the flag and the strong arm of the subaltern who was bearing it. But now it was not that ghostly flag half lost in the morning mist. In the blazing sun the golden eagle shone forth and the silk tricolor gleamed in brilliant tones in spite of all the wear and tear of battles. Against the blue sky, in the hurricane of gunfire, it floated like a flag of victory.","Raising his eyes presently Maurice was startled to see Colonel de Vineuil sitting his big horse at no great distance, man and steed impassive and motionless as if carved from stone, patient were they under the leaden hail, with face turned toward the enemy. The entire regiment was now collected in that vicinity, the other companies being posted in the adjacent fields; the musketry fire seemed to be drawing nearer. The young man also beheld the regimental colors a little to the rear, borne aloft by the sturdy arm of the standard-bearer, but it was no longer the phantom flag that he had seen that morning, shrouded in mist and fog; the golden eagle flashed and blazed in the fierce sunlight, and the tri-colored silk, despite the rents and stains of many a battle, flaunted its bright hues defiantly to the breeze. Waving in the breath of the cannon, floating proudly against the blue of heaven, it shone like an emblem of victory."
"– Dites donc, nous en sommes. C’est une riche idée, de foutre le camp. Déjà, des camarades sont partis, nous n’allons bien sûr pas nous laisser traîner comme des chiens jusque dans le pays à ces cochons… Hein ? à nous quatre, ça va-t-il, de prendre un courant d’air ?","– Say, we are. It's a rich idea, to get the hell out of here. Already, comrades have left, of course we are not going to let ourselves be dragged like dogs into the country of these pigs... Huh? Are the four of us ok to take a draft?","‘Look here, we’re in on this. It’s a grand idea to fuck off. Some of the blokes have got away already, and we’re certainly not going to let ourselves be dragged like a lot of dogs to the country of those bastards… So what about it for the four of us – O.K. to go for a stroll and take the air?’","“Say, comrades, count us in on that. That's a capital idea of yours, to skip the ranch. Some of the boys have gone already, and sure we're not going to be such fools as to let those bloody pigs drag us away like dogs into their infernal country. What do you say, eh? Shall we four make a break for liberty?”"
"Jean et Maurice, saisis d’horreur, avaient détourné la tête. Cependant, la faim les pressait, ils suivirent la bande, quand elle galopa, pour ne point se faire surprendre près du cheval entamé. Chouteau venait de faire une trouvaille, trois grosses betteraves, oubliées, qu’il emportait. Loubet, pour se décharger les bras, avait jeté la viande sur les épaules de Lapoulle ; tandis que Pache portait la marmite de l’escouade, qu’ils traînaient avec eux, en cas de chasse heureuse. Et les six galopaient, galopaient, sans reprendre haleine, comme poursuivis.","Jean and Maurice, seized with horror, had turned their heads away. However, hunger pressed them, they followed the band, when it galloped, so as not to be surprised near the attacked horse. Chouteau had just made a discovery, three large forgotten beets, which he was taking away. Loubet, to relieve his arms, had thrown the meat on Lapoulle's shoulders; while Pache carried the squad's pot, which they dragged with them, in case of a successful hunt. And the six galloped, galloped, without taking breath, as if pursued.","Sick with horror, Jean and Maurice had turned away. Nevertheless hunger was driving them, and they followed the rest when they ran away so as not to be caught near a horse that had been cut open. Chouteau had made a discovery, three large beetroots somebody had dropped, and took them. Loubet, to get his arms free, had thrown the meat over Lapoulle’s shoulders, and Pache carried the squad’s saucepan, which they took about with them in case they had any lucky find. All six ran and ran without stopping to breathe, as though they were being chased.","Jean and Maurice had averted their eyes in horror from the disgusting spectacle; still, however, the pangs of hunger were gnawing at their vitals, and when the band slunk rapidly away, so as not to be caught in the vicinity of the incriminating carcass, they followed it. Chouteau had discovered three large beets, that had somehow been overlooked by previous visitors to the field, and carried them off with him. Loubet had loaded the meat on Lapoulle's shoulders so as to have his own arms free, while Pache carried the kettle that belonged to the squad, which they had brought with them on the chance of finding something to cook in it. And the six men ran as if their lives were at stake, never stopping to take breath, as if they heard the pursuers at their heels."
"La blessure n’était presque rien, une simple éraflure du cuir chevelu, qui avait saigné beaucoup. Les cheveux, que le sang collait à présent, avaient formé tampon. Aussi se garda-t-il bien de les mouiller, pour ne pas rouvrir la plaie.","The wound was almost nothing, a simple scrape on the scalp, which had bled a lot. The hair, which the blood was sticking to now, had formed a buffer. So he was careful not to wet them, so as not to reopen the wound.","The wound was nothing much, just a grazing of the scalp, which had bled a lot. The hair, now matted with blood, had acted as a pad. So he took care not to wet it, so as not to reopen the place.","The wound was not serious; the bullet had plowed its way through the scalp and considerable blood had flowed. The hair, which was now matted with the coagulated gore, had served to stanch the current, therefore Maurice refrained from applying water to the hurt, so as not to cause it to bleed afresh."

"La veille, grâce à l’activité du maire de Vouziers, il y avait eu une distribution de pain, de viande et de fourrage ; et, vers dix heures, ce matin-là, on venait d’autoriser les hommes à faire la soupe, dans la crainte qu’ils n’en eussent ensuite plus le temps, lorsqu’un second départ de troupes, le départ de la brigade Bordas, qui prenait le chemin suivi par les hussards, occupa de nouveau toutes les têtes. Quoi donc ? est-ce qu’on partait ? est-ce qu’on n’allait pas les laisser manger tranquilles, maintenant que la marmite était au feu ? Mais les officiers expliquèrent que la brigade Bordas avait la mission d’occuper Buzancy, à quelques kilomètres de là. D’autres, à la vérité, disaient que les hussards s’étaient heurtés à un grand nombre d’escadrons ennemis, et qu’on envoyait la brigade, afin de les dégager.","The day before, thanks to the activity of the mayor of Vouziers, there had been a distribution of bread, meat and fodder; and, about ten o'clock that morning, the men had just been authorized to make the soup, fearing that they would not have time afterwards, when a second departure of troops, the departure of the Bordas brigade, which took the path followed by the hussars, again occupied all the heads. What ? were we leaving? weren't they going to let them eat in peace, now that the pot was on the fire? But the officers explained that the Bordas brigade had the mission of occupying Buzancy, a few kilometers away. Others, indeed, said that the hussars had come up against a large number of enemy squadrons, and that the brigade was being sent to extricate them.","On the previous day, thanks to the energy of the mayor of Vouziers, there had been an issue of bread, meat and forage, and that morning at about ten the men had just been authorized to make some stew for fear they might never have time later, when a second departure of troops, the Bordas brigade, which set off down the road taken by the hussars, once again set everyone speculating. What now? Were they off again? Weren’t they going to be left to eat in peace now that the pot was on the fire? But the officers explained that the Bordas brigade was detailed to occupy Buzancy, a few kilometres away. But others, to be sure, said that the hussars had run into a large number of enemy detachments and that the brigade was being sent to relieve them.","There had been an issue of bread, meat, and forage the day before, thanks to the efficient mayor of Vouziers, and about ten o'clock that morning permission had been granted the men to make soup, in the fear that they might not soon again have so good an opportunity, when another movement of troops, the departure of Bordas' brigade over the road taken by the hussars, set all tongues wagging afresh. What! were they going to march again? were they not to be given a chance to eat their breakfast in peace, now that the kettle was on the fire? But the officers explained that Bordas' brigade had only been sent to occupy Buzancy, a few kilometers from there. There were others, indeed, who asserted that the hussars had encountered a strong force of the enemy's cavalry and that the brigade had been dispatched to help them out of their difficulty."
"– De Bazeilles à Balan, j’ai failli être tué vingt fois.

"Le drapeau, le colonel disparurent, noyés sous une nouvelle vague, et le bataillon avançait toujours, sans savoir où, comme dans une ouate humide. On avait descendu une pente, on remontait maintenant par un chemin étroit. Puis, le cri de halte retentit. Et l’on resta là, l’arme au pied, les épaules alourdies par le sac, avec défense de bouger.

It was seven o'clock, the cannon seemed to have come closer, new batteries were firing on the other side of Sedan, closer and closer.","Flag and colonel disappeared, swallowed up in a new cloud, and the battalion still advanced without knowing where it was going, as though in damp cotton wool. They had come downhill and were now climbing again up a narrow lane. The command to halt rang out. And there they stood easy, their packs weighing down on their shoulders, forbidden to move. They must be on some high land, but it was still impossible to see twenty paces and nothing could be made out. It was now seven, and the gunfire seemed to have come nearer, fresh batteries were firing on the other side of Sedan, nearer and nearer.","Another billow of vapor came scurrying up from the river, enshrouding in its fleecy depths colonel, standard, and all, and the battalion passed on, whitherward no one could tell. First their route had conducted them over descending ground, now they were climbing a hill. On reaching the summit the command, halt! started at the front and ran down the column; the men were cautioned not to leave the ranks, arms were ordered, and there they remained, the heavy knapsacks forming a grievous burden to weary shoulders. It was evident that they were on a plateau, but to discern localities was out of the question; twenty paces was the extreme range of vision. It was now seven o'clock; the sound of firing reached them more distinctly, other batteries were apparently opening on Sedan from the opposite bank."
"Henriette l’avait écoutée, très grave. Ces choses la surprenaient, car elle ne les comprenait pas. Sans doute, elle était autre. Depuis le matin, son cœur était avec son mari, avec son frère, là-bas, sous les balles. Comment pouvait-on dormir si paisible, s’égayer de cet air amoureux, quand les êtres aimés se trouvaient en péril ?","Henriette had listened to her, very serious. These things surprised her, because she did not understand them. No doubt she was different. Since morning, her heart had been with her husband, with her brother, over there, under the bullets. How could one sleep so peacefully, be cheerful with this air of love, when loved ones were in danger?",Henriette had looked very serious while she was listening. Such things took her aback because she did not understand them. Perhaps she was different. Since first thing that morning her heart had been with her husband and her brother out there under fire. How could anyone sleep so peacefully and go in for such carefree dallying when loved ones were in peril?,"Henriette had listened to her confidences with a very grave face. Such things surprised her, for she could not understand them; it must be that she was constituted differently from other women. Her heart that morning was with her husband, her brother, down there where the battle was raging. How was it possible that anyone could sleep so peacefully and be so gay and cheerful when the loved ones were in peril?"
"Et ce fut son dernier souffle, il expira, la face droite et têtue, les yeux ouverts, regardant toujours la bataille. Des mouches déjà volaient et se posaient sur la tête broyée de Françoise ; tandis que le petit Auguste, dans son lit, pris du délire de la fièvre, appelait, demandait à boire, d’une voix basse et suppliante.","And it was his last breath, he exhaled, his face straight and stubborn, his eyes open, still watching the battle. Flies were already flying and landing on Françoise's crushed head; while little Auguste, in his bed, seized with the delirium of fever, called, asked for a drink, in a low, supplicating voice.","That was his last breath, and he expired, head up and steadfast, eyes open, still watching the battle. Already the flies were hovering and settling on the smashed face of Françoise, and the child Auguste from his bed in a feverish delirium, kept calling and asking for a drink in a low, imploring voice.","It was his last utterance; his spirit passed, his ingenuous, resolute face and his wide open eyes still turned on the battle. The flies already were beginning to buzz about Francoise's head and settle there, while lying on his bed little Charles, in an access of delirium, was calling on his mother in pitiful, beseeching tones to give him something to quench his thirst."
"Maurice approuva la création d’un Comité de salut public. Des pages d’histoire lui revenaient, l’heure n’avait-elle pas sonné des mesures énergiques, si l’on voulait sauver la patrie ? De toutes les violences, une seule lui avait serré le cœur d’une angoisse secrète, le renversement de la colonne Vendôme ; et il s’accusait de cela comme d’une faiblesse d’enfant, il entendait toujours son grand-père lui raconter Marengo, Austerlitz, Iéna, Eylau, Friedland, Wagram, la Moskowa, des récits épiques dont il frémissait encore. Mais que l’on rasât la maison de Thiers l’assassin, que l’on gardât les otages comme une garantie et une menace, est-ce que cela n’était pas de justes représailles, dans cette rage grandissante de Versailles contre Paris, qu’il bombardait, où les obus crevaient les toits, tuaient des femmes ? Le sombre besoin de destruction montait en lui, à mesure que la fin de son rêve approchait. Si l’idée justicière et vengeresse devait être écrasée dans le sang, que s’entr’ouvrît donc la terre, transformée au milieu d’un de ces bouleversements cosmiques, qui ont renouvelé la vie ! Que Paris s’effondrât, qu’il brûlât comme un immense bûcher d’holocauste, plutôt que d’être rendu à ses vices et à ses misères, à cette vieille société gâtée d’abominable injustice ! Et il faisait un autre grand rêve noir, la ville géante en cendre, plus rien que des tisons fumants sur les deux rives, la plaie guérie par le feu, une catastrophe sans nom, sans exemple, d’où sortirait un peuple nouveau. Aussi s’enfiévrait-il davantage aux récits qui couraient : les quartiers minés, les catacombes bourrées de poudre, tous les monuments prêts à sauter, des fils électriques réunissant les fourneaux pour qu’une seule étincelle les allumât tous d’un coup, des provisions considérables de matières inflammables, surtout du pétrole, de quoi changer les rues et les places en torrents, en mers de flammes. La Commune l’avait juré, si les Versaillais entraient, pas un n’irait au delà des barricades qui fermaient les carrefours, les pavés s’ouvriraient, les édifices crouleraient, Paris flamberait et engloutirait tout un monde.","Maurice approved the creation of a Committee of Public Safety. Pages of history came back to him, hadn't the hour struck for energetic measures, if we wanted to save the country? Of all the acts of violence, only one had seized his heart with secret anguish, the overthrow of the Vendôme Column; and he accused himself of this as of a childish weakness, he always heard his grandfather tell him Marengo, Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau, Friedland, Wagram, Moskowa, epic tales from which he still shuddered. But to raze the house of Thiers the assassin, to keep the hostages as a guarantee and a threat, wasn't that just reprisals, in this growing rage of Versailles against Paris, that he bombarded, where the shells burst the roofs, killed women? The dark need for destruction rose in him, as the end of his dream approached. If the idea of justice and vengeance were to be crushed in blood, may the earth open up, transformed in the midst of one of those cosmic upheavals which have renewed life! May Paris collapse, may it burn like an immense pyre of holocaust, rather than be returned to its vices and its miseries, to this old society spoiled with abominable injustice! And he had another great dark dream, the giant city in ashes, nothing but smoking embers on both banks, the wound healed by fire, a nameless catastrophe, without example, from which a new people would emerge. So he became more feverish with the stories that went around: the mined quarters, the catacombs stuffed with gunpowder, all the monuments ready to blow up, electric wires bringing together the furnaces so that a single spark lit them all at once, considerable supplies of inflammable materials, especially petroleum, enough to turn the streets and squares into torrents, into seas of flames. The Commune had sworn that if the Versaillese entered, not one would go beyond the barricades which closed the crossroads, the cobblestones would open, the buildings would crumble, Paris would go up in flames and swallow up a whole world.","Maurice approved of the setting up of a Committee of Public Safety. He recalled pages of history – had not the time come for energetic measures if their country was to be saved? Only one of the many acts of violence had really given him a secret pang of sorrow, and that was the overthrowing of the Vendôme column, and he reproached himself for that as though it were a childish weakness, for he still had ringing in his ears his grandfather’s stories of Marengo, Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau, Friedland, Wagram and Borodino, and these epic tales thrilled him still. But that the murderer Thiers’s house should be razed to the ground, that they should keep hostages as a safeguard and threat, wasn’t that fair reprisal for the increasing fury of Versailles in its shelling of Paris, where shells were smashing in roofs and killing women? The black lust of destruction was mounting in him as the awakening from his dream drew near. If the ideal of justice and vengeance were to be crushed in bloodshed, well, let the earth open and be transformed in one of those cosmic upheavals by which life has been renewed! Let Paris collapse and burn like a huge sacrificial fire rather than be given back to its vices, miseries and the old social system corrupted with abominable injustice! And he indulged in another bleak dream, the gigantic city in ashes, nothing left on both sides of the river but smoking embers, the wound cauterized by fire, an unspeakable, unparalleled catastrophe out of which a new people would emerge. So the tales going round excited him more and more: whole neighbourhoods mined, the catacombs filled with gunpowder, all the great public buildings ready to be blown up, electric wires connecting the blast-holes so that one single spark could detonate them all together, large stocks of inflammable material, especially oil, enough to turn streets and squares into torrents and seas of flame. The Commune had sworn it would be so if the Versailles forces entered; not one would get past the barricades blocking the main crossings, for the roadways themselves would open up and buildings crumble into dust, and Paris would go up in flames and swallow a whole world.","Maurice favored the creation of a Committee of Public Safety. The warnings of history came to his mind; had not the hour struck for adopting energetic methods if they wished to save the country? There was but one of their barbarities that really pained him, and that was the destruction of the Vendome column; he reproached himself for the feeling as being a childish weakness, but his grandfather's voice still sounded in his ears repeating the old familiar tales of Marengo, Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau, Friedland, Wagram, the Moskowa—those epic narratives that thrilled his pulses yet as often as he thought of them. But that they should demolish the house of the murderer Thiers, that they should retain the hostages as a guarantee and a menace, was not that right and just when the Versaillese were unchaining their fury on Paris, bombarding it, destroying its edifices, slaughtering women and children with their shells? As he saw the end of his dream approaching dark thoughts of ruin and destruction filled his mind. If their ideas of justice and retribution were not to prevail, if they were to be crushed out of them with their life-blood, then perish the world, swept away in one of those cosmic upheavals that are the beginning of a new life. Let Paris sink beneath the waves, let it go up in smoke and flame, like a gigantic funeral pyre, sooner than let it be again delivered over to its former state of vice and misery, to that old vicious social system of abominable injustice. And he dreamed another dark, terrible dream, the great city reduced to ashes, naught to be seen on either side the Seine but piles of smoldering ruins, the festering wound purified and healed with fire, a catastrophe without a name, such as had never been before, whence should arise a new race. Wild stories were everywhere circulated, which interested him intensely, of the mines that were driven under all the quarters of the city, the barrels of powder with which the catacombs were stuffed, the monuments and public buildings ready to be blown into the air at a moment's notice; and all were connected by electric wires in such a way that a single spark would suffice to set them off; there were great stores of inflammable substances, too, especially petroleum, with which the streets and avenues were to be converted into seething lakes of flame. The Commune had sworn that should the Versaillese enter the city not one of them would ever get beyond the barricades that closed the ends of the streets; the pavements would yawn, the houses would sink in ruins, Paris would go up in flames, and bury assailants and assailed under its ashes."
"En effet, l’ennemi devait préparer une nouvelle attaque, car la fusillade redoublait et le sifflement des obus ne cessait plus. Deux déjà étaient tombés sur la route, à une centaine de mètres ; un autre venait de s’enfoncer dans la terre molle du jardin voisin, sans éclater.","Indeed, the enemy had to prepare a new attack, because the shooting redoubled and the whistling of the shells did not cease any more. Two had already fallen on the road, a hundred yards away; another had just sunk into the soft earth of the neighboring garden, without bursting.","And indeed the enemy must have been working up for a fresh attack, for the fusillade redoubled its intensity and the screaming of shells never let up. Two had already come down on the road a hundred metres away and another had buried itself in the soft earth of the garden without exploding.","There were indications, indeed, that the enemy were making ready for another assault. The infantry fire was spluttering away more furiously than ever, and the screaming of the shells was incessant. Two had already fallen in the street a hundred yards away, and a third had imbedded itself, without bursting, in the soft ground of the adjacent garden."
"– Dites donc, répéta Delaherche, vous entendez, ça commence bien… Il serait sage de rentrer tout de suite à Sedan.","“I say so,” repeated Delaherche, “you hear, things are starting well… It would be wise to go back to Sedan right away.","‘I say,’ Delaherche said again, ‘can you hear that, it’s really starting… It would be wise to get straight back to Sedan.’","“I say,” Delaherche continued, “do you hear that? It is a promising beginning. Our best course is to get back to Sedan as soon as possible.”"
"– Ne marche donc pas si vite, sacré bon Dieu ! répétait Jean dans le dos de Maurice. Tu vas nous faire reprendre.","""Don't walk so fast, damn it!"" repeated Jean behind Maurice's back. You're gonna take us back.","‘Not so fast, for God’s sake!’ Jean kept saying behind Maurice’s back. ‘You’ll give us away!’","“Don't walk so fast, confound it!” Jean breathed in a whisper behind Maurice's back. “You'll have them after us.”"
"– Vous ne savez donc pas, mon cher garçon, que l’empereur est descendu chez les Desroches… On a réquisitionné la maison pour lui, et ils ne sont guère satisfaits du grand honneur, je vous assure. Quand on pense qu’on a forcé la pauvre vieille maman, une femme de soixante-dix ans passés, à donner sa chambre et à monter se coucher sous les toits, dans un lit de bonne !… Tenez, tout ce que vous voyez là, sur la place, c’est à l’empereur, ce sont ses malles enfin, vous comprenez !","""So you don't know, my dear boy, that the Emperor has stayed with the Desroches. The house has been requisitioned for him, and they are hardly satisfied with the great honour, I assure you."" When you think that they forced the poor old mother, a woman past seventy, to give up her room and go up to bed under the roof, in a maid's bed!... Look, everything you see there , on the square, it's the Emperor's, it's his trunks after all, you understand!","‘So you don’t know, my dear boy, that the Emperor is lodging at the Desroches’s. The house has been commandeered for him and they are not all that pleased with the great honour, I can tell you. When you think that the poor old mother, a woman well past seventy has been forced to give up her own room and go and sleep up in the garret in a maid’s bed!… Look, all you can see out there on the square is to do with the Emperor – his luggage in fact, if you see what I mean!’","You could not know, my dear boy, that the Emperor is at the Desvallieres. His officers took possession of the house in his name and the family are not any too well pleased with the great honor done them, I can tell you. To think that the poor old mother, a woman more than seventy, was compelled to give up her room and go up and occupy a servant's bed in the garret! Look, there, on the place. All that you see there is the Emperor's; those are his trunks, don't you see!”"
"Dans le bois, dans le grand silence noir des arbres immobiles, quand ils n’entendirent plus rien, que plus rien ne remua et qu’ils se crurent sauvés, une émotion extraordinaire les jeta aux bras l’un de l’autre. Maurice pleurait à gros sanglots, tandis que des larmes lentes ruisselaient sur les joues de Jean. C’était la détente de leur long tourment, la joie de se dire que la douleur allait peut-être avoir pitié d’eux. Et ils se serraient d’une étreinte éperdue, dans la fraternité de tout ce qu’ils venaient de souffrir ensemble ; et le baiser qu’ils échangèrent alors leur parut le plus doux et le plus fort de leur vie, un baiser tel qu’ils n’en recevraient jamais d’une femme, l’immortelle amitié, l’absolue certitude que leurs deux cœurs n’en faisaient plus qu’un, pour toujours.","In the wood, in the great black silence of the motionless trees, when they no longer heard anything, when nothing moved and they thought themselves saved, an extraordinary emotion threw them into each other's arms. Maurice wept deeply, while slow tears streamed down Jean's cheeks. It was the relaxation of their long torment, the joy of knowing that the pain might perhaps take pity on them. And they pressed each other in a desperate embrace, in the fraternity of all that they had just suffered together; and the kiss they then exchanged seemed to them the sweetest and strongest of their lives, a kiss such as they would never receive from a woman, the immortal friendship, the absolute certainty that their two hearts were one, forever.","In the wood, in the great dark stillness of the trees, when they could not hear a sound and nothing stirred and they thought they were secure, an extraordinary emotion made them fall into each other’s arms. Maurice was crying like a child, and tears rolled slowly down Jean’s cheeks. It was the reaction after their long torment, the joy of telling themselves that suffering might perhaps take pity on them at last. They hugged each other in a passionate embrace, made brothers by all they had gone through together, and the kiss they exchanged seemed the gentlest yet the strongest in their lives, a kiss the like of which they would never have from a woman, undying friendship and absolute certainty that their two hearts were henceforth one for ever.","Once they were in the wood, in the deep, dark silence of the slumbering trees, where no sound reached their ears, where nothing stirred and they believed their safety was assured them, they sank into each other's arms in an uncontrollable impulse of emotion. Maurice was sobbing violently, while big tears trickled slowly down Jean's cheeks. It was the natural revulsion of their overtaxed feelings after the long-protracted ordeal they had passed through, the joy and delight of their mutual assurance that their troubles were at an end, and that thenceforth suffering and they were to be strangers. And united by the memory of what they had endured together in ties closer than those of brotherhood, they clasped each other in a wild embrace, and the kiss that they exchanged at that moment seemed to them to possess a savor and a poignancy such as they had never experienced before in all their life; a kiss such as they never could receive from lips of woman, sealing their undying friendship, giving additional confirmation to the certainty that thereafter their two hearts would be but one, for all eternity."
"C’était vrai, il eut un geste pour s’excuser de sa question sotte. Pourtant, l’idée de cette conversation suprême le tracassait : quel intérêt elle avait dû offrir ! à quel parti avaient-ils pu s’arrêter ?","It was true, he gestured to apologize for his foolish question. Yet the idea of this supreme conversation bothered him: what interest it must have offered! where could they have stopped?","Of course it was true, and with a gesture he apologized for his silly question. Yet he was haunted by the thought of this fateful conversation: how important it must have been and what decision had they reached?",She was right; he made an apologetic gesture in recognition of the stupidity of his question. But the thought of that fateful conversation haunted him; the interest there was in it for him who could have heard it! What decision had they arrived at?
"Rochas, cependant, triomphait. Autour de lui, le feu des quelques soldats, qu’il excitait de sa voix tonnante, avait pris une telle vivacité, à la vue des Prussiens, que ceux-ci, reculant, rentraient dans le petit bois.","Rochas, however, triumphed. Around him the fire of the few soldiers, whom he excited with his thundering voice, had taken on such vivacity at the sight of the Prussians that the latter, recoiling, re-entered the little wood.","Meanwhile Rochas was having his moment of triumph. Round him the firing of a handful of soldiers, inspired by his stentorian voice, had so intensified at the sight of the Prussians that the latter fell back into the little wood.","Rochas, meantime, was in his element. He had excited the few zouaves and other troops around him to such a pitch of frenzy, their fire had become so murderously effective at sight of the Prussians, that the latter first wavered and then retreated to the shelter of their wood."

"De son bras valide, il évoquait les galas de Gomorrhe et de Sodome, les musiques, les fleurs, les jouissances monstrueuses, les palais crevant de telles débauches, éclairant l’abomination des nudités d’un tel luxe de bougies, qu’ils s’étaient incendiés eux-mêmes. Soudain, il y eut un fracas épouvantable. C’était, aux Tuileries, le feu, venu des deux bouts, qui atteignait la salle des Maréchaux. Les tonneaux de poudre s’enflammaient, le pavillon de l’Horloge sautait, avec une violence de poudrière. Une gerbe immense monta, un panache qui emplit le ciel noir, le bouquet flamboyant de l’effroyable fête.","With his good arm, he evoked the galas of Gomorrah and Sodom, the music, the flowers, the monstrous pleasures, the palaces bursting with such debauchery, lighting up the abomination of nudity with such a luxury of candles, that they were set on fire themselves. Suddenly there was a terrible crash. It was, at the Tuileries, the fire, coming from both ends, which reached the Salle des Maréchaux. The barrels of gunpowder ignited, the Pavillon de l'Horloge exploded with the violence of a powder keg. An immense sheaf rose, a plume that filled the black sky, the flamboyant bouquet of the dreadful celebration.","With his good arm he sketched visions of the galas in Sodom and Gomorrah, with music, flowers and unnatural orgies, palaces bursting with such debaucheries, the disgusting nudities illuminated with such a riot of candles that they themselves were set on fire. Then there was a fearful crash. The fire in the Tuileries had worked its way along from both ends and reached the Salle des Maréchaux. The barrels of gunpowder had caught and the Pavillon de l’Horloge went up like an exploding magazine. An immense fountain of fire rose like a plume and filled the black sky – the final set-piece of the gruesome fête.","And he drew a picture of the feasts of Sodom and Gomorrah, the music, the lights, the flowers, the unmentionable orgies of lust and drunkenness, until the candles on the walls blushed at the shamelessness of the display and fired the palaces that sheltered such depravity. Suddenly there was a terrific explosion. The fire, approaching from either extremity of the Tuileries, had reached the Salle des Marechaux, the casks of powder caught, the Pavilion de l'Horloge was blown into the air with the violence of a powder mill. A column of flame mounted high in the heavens, and spreading, expanded in a great fiery plume on the inky blackness of the sky, the crowning display of the horrid fete."

"Alors, Jean eut une sensation extraordinaire. Il lui sembla, dans cette lente tombée du jour, au-dessus de cette cité en flammes, qu’une aurore déjà se levait. C’était bien pourtant la fin de tout, un acharnement du destin, un amas de désastres tels, que jamais nation n’en avait subi d’aussi grands : les continuelles défaites, les provinces perdues, les milliards à payer, la plus effroyable des guerres civiles noyée sous le sang, des décombres et des morts à pleins quartiers, plus d’argent, plus d’honneur, tout un monde à reconstruire ! Lui-même y laissait son cœur déchiré, Maurice, Henriette, son heureuse vie de demain emportée dans l’orage. Et pourtant, par delà la fournaise, hurlante encore, la vivace espérance renaissait, au fond du grand ciel calme, d’une limpidité souveraine. C’était le rajeunissement certain de l’éternelle nature, de l’éternelle humanité, le renouveau promis à qui espère et travaille, l’arbre qui jette une nouvelle tige puissante, quand on en a coupé la branche pourrie, dont la sève empoisonnée jaunissait les feuilles.","Then, Jean had an extraordinary feeling. It seemed to him, in this slow fall of day, above this city in flames, that a dawn was already rising. It was, however, the end of everything, a relentlessness of fate, a mass of disasters such as never had a nation suffered such great ones: the continual defeats, the provinces lost, the billions to be paid, the most appalling Civil wars drowned in blood, rubble and full quarters of dead, more money, more honor, a whole world to rebuild! He himself left his torn heart there, Maurice, Henriette, his happy future life swept away in the storm. And yet, beyond the furnace, still howling, the vivacious hope was reborn, at the bottom of the great calm sky, of a sovereign limpidity. It was the certain rejuvenation of eternal nature, of eternal humanity, the renewal promised to him who hopes and works, the tree which throws up a new powerful stem, when the rotten branch has been cut, whose poisonous sap yellowed the leaves.","Then Jean felt an extraordinary sensation. It seemed to him, as day was slowly dying over this burning city, that a new dawn was already breaking. Yet it was the end of everything, fate pursuing its relentless course in a series of disasters greater than any nation had ever undergone: continual defeats, provinces lost, milliards to pay, the blood-bath of the most dreadful of civil wars, whole districts full of ruins and dead, no money left, no honour left, a whole world to build up again. He himself was leaving his broken heart here, Maurice, Henriette, his happy future life swept away in the storm. And yet, beyond the still roaring furnace, undying hope was reviving up in that great calm sky so supremely limpid. It was the sure renewal of eternal nature, eternal humanity, the renewal promised to all who hope and toil, the tree throwing up a strong new shoot after the dead branch, whose poisonous sap had yellowed the leaves, had been cut away.","Then Jean had a strange experience. It seemed to him that in the slowly fading daylight, above the roofs of that flaming city, he beheld the dawning of another day. And yet the situation might well be considered irretrievable. Destiny appeared to have pursued them with her utmost fury; the successive disasters they had sustained were such as no nation in history had ever known before; defeat treading on the heels of defeat, their provinces torn from them, an indemnity of milliards to be raised, a most horrible civil war that had been quenched in blood, their streets cumbered with ruins and unburied corpses, without money, their honor gone, and order to be re-established out of chaos! His share of the universal ruin was a heart lacerated by the loss of Maurice and Henriette, the prospect of a happy future swept away in the furious storm! And still, beyond the flames of that furnace whose fiery glow had not subsided yet, Hope, the eternal, sat enthroned in the limpid serenity of the tranquil heavens. It was the certain assurance of the resurrection of perennial nature, of imperishable humanity; the harvest that is promised to him who sows and waits; the tree throwing out a new and vigorous shoot to replace the rotten limb that has been lopped away, which was blighting the young leaves with its vitiated sap. “Farewell!”"
"Ce fut, chez les Delaherche, une surprise presque joyeuse. Leur visage, pâli de pitié, s’éclaira, tandis que des gestes, heureux de la rencontre, leur échappaient. Et Gilberte tint à jeter elle-même le dernier pain dans les bras de Jean, ce qu’elle fit avec une si aimable maladresse, qu’elle en éclata d’un joli rire.","It was, at the Delaherches, an almost joyous surprise. Their faces, pale with pity, lit up, while gestures, happy at the meeting, escaped them. And Gilberte insisted on throwing the last loaf herself into Jean's arms, which she did with such amiable awkwardness that she burst out laughing.","It was almost a happy surprise for the Delaherches. Their sombre, compassionate faces lit up and they could not restrain gestures of joy at the meeting. Gilberte insisted on throwing the last loaf into Jean’s arms, which she did with such charming clumsiness that she burst into a peal of pretty laughter.","The Delaherches seemed delighted to see them in the midst of their surprise. Their faces, pallid with emotion, suddenly brightened, and they displayed by the warmth of their gestures the pleasure they experienced in the encounter. There was one solitary loaf left, which Gilberte insisted on throwing with her own hands, and pitched it into Jean's extended arms in such a charmingly awkward way that she gave a winsome laugh at her own expense."
– Est-ce que tu es blessée ?… C’est fou d’être venue…,– Are you hurt?… It’s crazy to have come…,"‘Are you wounded, dear?… You were mad to come.’",“Are you hurt?” he asked. “You were mad to come—”
"– Mais, nom de Dieu ! nous allons y rester tous ! On ne peut pas se laisser détruire ainsi !","- But, for God's sake! we will all stay there! We cannot allow ourselves to be destroyed like this!","‘But fucking hell, we shall stay here for good, the whole lot of us. We can’t just let ourselves be done in like this!’","“But, good God! there won't a man of us escape! We can't allow the men to be murdered like this!”"
"Dehors, Delaherche éprouva une difficulté plus grande à se frayer un passage parmi les groupes qui avaient grossi. Les rues, de minute en minute, s’emplissaient davantage, du flot des soldats débandés. Il questionna plusieurs des officiers qu’il rencontra : aucun n’avait aperçu le drapeau blanc sur la citadelle. Enfin, un colonel déclara l’avoir entrevu un instant, le temps de le hisser et de l’abattre. Cela aurait tout expliqué, soit que les Allemands n’eussent pu le voir, soit que, l’ayant vu apparaître et disparaître, ils eussent redoublé leur feu, en comprenant que l’agonie était proche. Même une histoire circulait déjà, la folle colère d’un général, qui s’était précipité, à l’apparition du drapeau blanc, l’avait arraché de ses mains, brisant la hampe, foulant le linge. Et les batteries prussiennes tiraient toujours, les projectiles pleuvaient sur les toits et dans les rues, des maisons brûlaient, une femme venait d’avoir la tête broyée, au coin de la place Turenne.","Outside, Delaherche found it more difficult to make his way through the groups that had grown. The streets, from minute to minute, filled more and more with the stream of disbanded soldiers. He questioned several of the officers he met: none had seen the white flag on the citadel. Finally, a colonel declared having glimpsed it for a moment, the time to hoist it up and bring it down. That would have explained everything, either that the Germans could not see him, or that, having seen him appear and disappear, they would have redoubled their fire, realizing that the agony was near. Even a story was already circulating, the mad anger of a general, who had rushed, at the appearance of the white flag, had torn it from his hands, breaking the pole, trampling the laundry. And the Prussian batteries were still firing, the projectiles rained down on the roofs and in the streets, houses were burning, a woman had just had her head crushed, at the corner of the Place Turenne.","Outside Delaherche found it more difficult to push his way through the troops who had swelled in numbers. Every minute the streets were getting more crowded with the stream of straggling soldiers. He questioned some of the officers he met and none had seen the white flag over the citadel. Finally a colonel said he had caught a momentary glimpse of it – just being run up and lowered again. That would explain everything, for either the Germans had not had time to see it or, seeing it appear and disappear, they had redoubled their fire realizing that the end was near. There was even a rumour already about the crazy anger of a general who had dashed forward when the white flag appeared, snatched it down with his own hands, breaking the staff and trampling the cloth underfoot. So the Prussian batteries were still firing, shells were raining down on roofs and in the streets, houses were burning and a woman had her head smashed at the corner of the Place Turenne.","On leaving the factory Delaherche found it no easy task to squeeze his way through the throng; at every instant the crowd of straggling soldiers that filled the streets received fresh accessions. He questioned several of the officers whom he encountered; not one of them had seen the white flag on the citadel. Finally he met a colonel, who declared that he had caught a momentary glimpse of it: that it had been run up and then immediately hauled down. That explained matters; either the Germans had not seen it, or seeing it appear and disappear so quickly, had inferred the distressed condition of the French and redoubled their fire in consequence. There was a story in circulation how a general officer, enraged beyond control at the sight of the flag, had wrested it from its bearer, broken the staff, and trampled it in the mud. And still the Prussian batteries continued to play upon the city, shells were falling upon the roofs and in the streets, houses were in flames; a woman had just been killed at the corner of the Rue Pont de Meuse and the Place Turenne."
"– Oh ! maman, maman, emmène-moi, j’ai peur !","- Oh ! mom, mom, take me away, I'm scared!","‘Oh Mummy, Mummy, take me away, I’m frightened!’","“Oh! mammy, mammy, take me away, I'm 'fraid!”"
"Les yeux du capitaine Beaudoin pâlirent, se troublèrent d’une sorte de petite fumée rousse. Il avait compris. Mais, malgré l’insupportable peur qui l’étranglait, il répondit simplement, avec bravoure :","Captain Beaudoin's eyes grew pale, clouded with a kind of little red smoke. He understood. But, in spite of the unbearable fear which strangled him, he answered simply, with bravery:","Beaudoin’s eyes lost their lustre and seemed to cloud over with a sort of reddish mist. He had understood. But in spite of the unbearable fear choking him, he answered simply and with courage:","To Captain Beaudoin it seemed as if a sort of reddish vapor arose before his eyes through which he saw things obscurely. He understood. But notwithstanding the intolerable fear that appeared to be clutching at his throat, he replied, unaffectedly and bravely:"
– L’empereur !,- The emperor !,‘The Emperor!’,“The Emperor!”
"– Rue Maqua, presque au coin de la rue au Beurre, une grande belle maison, avec des sculptures.","– Rue Maqua, almost at the corner of rue au Beurre, a large beautiful house, with sculptures.","‘Rue Maqua, almost at the corner of the rue au Beurre, a nice big house with carvings on it.’","“In the Rue Maqua, near the corner of the Rue au Beurre; you can't mistake it; it is a big house, with statues in the garden.”"
"Mais, cette fois, on les avait entendus. Des branches s’étaient cassées, des pierres roulaient. Et, comme au qui vive de la sentinelle, ils se mirent à galoper, sans répondre, le poste prit les armes, des coups de feu partirent, criblant de balles le taillis.","But this time, we had heard them. Branches had broken, stones were rolling. And, as though alert to the sentinel, they began to gallop, without replying, the post took up arms, shots were fired, riddled the copse with bullets.","This time they had been heard. Branches had been snapped and stones dislodged. As, challenged by the sentry, they began to run without answering, the whole post took up arms and shots were fired which whistled through the thicket.","This time, however, they had been heard. The sound of snapping twigs and rolling stones betrayed them. And as they did not answer the challenge of the sentry, but made off at the double-quick, the men seized their muskets and sent a shower of bullets crashing through the thicket, into which the fugitives had plunged incontinently."
"À Berlin ! à Berlin ! Maurice entendit ce cri hurlé par la foule grouillante des boulevards, pendant la nuit de fol enthousiasme, qui l’avait décidé à s’engager. Le vent venait de tourner, sous un coup de tempête ; et il y avait une saute terrible, et tout le tempérament de la race était dans cette confiance exaltée, qui tombait brusquement, dès le premier revers, à la désespérance dont le galop l’emportait parmi ces soldats errants, vaincus et dispersés, avant d’avoir combattu.","In Berlin ! in Berlin ! Maurice heard this cry howled by the swarming crowd of the boulevards, during the night of mad enthusiasm, which had decided him to enlist. The wind had just changed, under a stormy blow; and there was a terrible leap, and the whole temperament of the race was in this exalted confidence, which fell suddenly, at the first reverse, to the despair whose gallop carried it away among these wandering soldiers, vanquished and dispersed, before to have fought.","To Berlin! To Berlin! Maurice could still hear that cry yelled by the milling crowds on the boulevards during that night of wild excitement which had made him decide to enlist. The wind had changed in a violent storm and here was a terrible about-turn: the whole temperament of the race showed itself in this sublime confidence suddenly crashing down at the very first reverse into the despair which galloped away with these lost soldiers, defeated and scattered before ever striking a blow.","To Berlin! To Berlin! The cry rang in Maurice's ears, the yell of the swarming mob that filled the boulevards on that midsummer night of frenzied madness when he had determined to enlist. The gentle breeze had become a devastating hurricane; there had been a terrific explosion, and all the sanguine temper of his nation had manifested itself in his absolute, enthusiastic confidence, which had vanished utterly at the very first reverse, before the unreasoning impulse of despair that was sweeping him away among those vagrant soldiers, vanquished and dispersed before they had struck a stroke."
"– D’où viennent-ils ? Qu’est-ce qu’ils veulent ?… Ah ! c’est vous, les francs-tireurs ! Encore des traîne-la-patte, hein !","- Where do they come from ? What do they want?... Ah! it's you, snipers! More paw-dragging, huh!","‘Where have they come from? What do they want? Oh, it’s you, the guerrillas! Another lot of Weary Willies, eh?’","Who were they? Whence did they come? What did they want? Ah, some of those francs-tireurs gentlemen—eh! Same thing as skulkers and riff-raff!"
"Le lieutenant d’infanterie de marine, qui regardait lui aussi, eut un geste d’absolue certitude, en disant :","The marine infantry lieutenant, who was also watching, made a gesture of absolute certainty, saying:","The lieutenant was watching too, and he made a gesture of absolute certainty as he said:","The lieutenant of marines, who had turned his eyes in the same direction, spoke up confidently:"
"Comme le régiment marquait le pas, attendant de repartir, il en éclata un sur la droite, qui, heureusement, ne blessa personne. Cinq minutes s’écoulèrent, infinies, effroyables. On ne bougeait toujours point, il y avait là-bas un obstacle qui barrait la route, quelque brusque muraille qui s’était bâtie. Et le colonel, droit sur les étriers, regardait, frémissant, sentant derrière lui monter la panique de ses hommes.","As the regiment marked time, waiting to move on, one burst on the right, which fortunately did not injure anyone. Five minutes passed, infinite, appalling. They still did not move, there was an obstacle there which blocked the way, some sudden wall which had been built. And the colonel, straight in the stirrups, watched, quivering, feeling the panic of his men mounting behind him.","As the regiment was marking time, waiting to set off again, one exploded to their right which fortunately did not wound anyone. Five interminable, terrifying minutes went by and still they made no move , there was some obstacle blocking the road further on, some wall had apparently sprung up. The colonel stood up in his stirrups and shuddered as he looked, for he was conscious of the mounting panic of his men behind.","The regiment had not yet reached Harancourt, and the shells were still tumbling about them; while the men were marking time, awaiting the word to go ahead again, one burst, on the right of the column, without injuring anyone, fortunately. Five minutes passed, that seemed to them long as an eternity, and still they did not move; there was some obstacle on ahead that barred their way as effectually as if a strong wall had been built across the road. The colonel, standing up in his stirrups, peered nervously to the front, for he saw that it would require but little to create a panic among his men."
"Le général Bourgain-Desfeuilles venait précisément de monter, à droite, sur un mamelon, emmenant avec lui le colonel de Vineuil, afin de reconnaître le pays. On les voyait là-haut, entre deux petits bois, leurs lorgnettes braquées ; et, tout de suite, ils dépêchèrent un aide de camp qui se trouvait avec eux, pour dire qu’on leur envoyât les francs-tireurs, s’ils étaient là encore. Quelques hommes, Jean, Maurice, d’autres, accompagnèrent ceux-ci, dans le cas où l’on aurait besoin d’une aide quelconque.","General Bourgain-Desfeuilles had just mounted a hill on the right, taking Colonel de Vineuil with him, in order to reconnoitre the country. You could see them up there, between two little woods, their opera glasses trained; and they immediately dispatched an aide-de-camp who was with them, to say that the franc-tireurs should be sent to them, if they were still there. A few men, Jean, Maurice, others, accompanied them, in case any help was needed.","General Bourgain-Desfeuilles had just gone up a hill to the right, with Colonel de Vineuil, to reconnoitre the country. They could be seen on the top, between two clumps of trees, field-glasses raised, and at once they sent down an aide-de-camp who was with them to ask for the guerrillas to be sent up if they were still there. A few men, Jean, Maurice and some others, went up with them in case any help should be needed.","General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, accompanied by Colonel de Vineuil, had climbed a hill on the right to reconnoiter the country. They were visible up there in a little clearing between two belts of wood, scanning the surrounding hills with their field-glasses, when all at once they dispatched an aide-de-camp to the column, with instructions to send up to them the francs-tireurs if they were still there. A few men, Jean and Maurice among them, accompanied the latter, in case there should be need of messengers."
"Devant ce meurtre imbécile et fou, Maurice, immobile jusque-là, parut lui-même être pris brusquement de folie. Il menaçait les trois hommes du geste, il les traitait d’assassins, avec une telle véhémence, que tout son corps en tremblait. Mais Lapoulle ne semblait même pas l’entendre. Resté par terre, accroupi près du corps, il dévorait le pain, éclaboussé de gouttes rouges ; il avait un air de stupidité farouche, comme étourdi par le gros bruit de ses mâchoires ; tandis que Chouteau et Loubet, à le voir si terrible dans son assouvissement, n’osaient pas même lui réclamer leur part.","Faced with this imbecile and mad murder, Maurice, motionless until then, seemed himself to be suddenly seized with madness. He threatened the three men with a gesture, he called them assassins, with such vehemence that his whole body trembled. But Lapoulle did not even seem to hear him. Remaining on the ground, squatting close to the body, he devoured the bread, spattered with red drops; he had an air of fierce stupidity, as if stunned by the loud noise of his jaws; while Chouteau and Loubet, seeing him so terrible in his satisfaction, did not even dare to ask him for their share.","In the face of this stupid, insane murder Maurice, who had not moved until then, seemed to go suddenly out of his mind as well. He threatened the three men with his fists and called them murderers with such vehemence that his whole body was shaking. But Lapoulle did not seem even to hear. He stayed on the ground, crouching by the body, devouring the bread, red splashes of blood and all, with a wild, brutish look as though besotted by the noise of his own jaws, while Chouteau and Loubet, seeing how terrible he was as he appeased his hunger, did not even dare to ask for their shares.","At sight of the imbecile, uncalled-for murder, Maurice, who had until then been a silent spectator of the scene, appeared as if stricken by a sudden fit of madness. He raved and gesticulated, shaking his fist in the face of the three men and calling them murderers, assassins, with a violence that shook his frame from head to foot. But Lapoulle seemed not even to hear him. Squatted on the ground beside the corpse, he was devouring the bloodstained bread, an expression of stupid ferocity on his face, with a loud grinding of his great jaws, while Chouteau and Loubet, seeing him thus terrible in the gratification of his wild-beast appetite, did not even dare claim their portion."
– Tu es donc là ? Ah ! que je suis content de te voir avant de mourir !,"""So are you there?"" Ah! How glad I am to see you before I die!","‘So you are here. Oh, how glad I am to see you before I die!’","“You here! Ah, how glad I am to see you once more before I die!”"
"Et il ne se sentit un peu en sûreté que lorsqu’il eut fait descendre à Maurice l’escalier de la berge, à gauche du pont Royal, en aval. Là, sous le bouquet de grands arbres, au bord de l’eau, ils étaient cachés. Pendant près d’un quart d’heure, des ombres noires qui s’agitaient en face, sur l’autre quai, les inquiétèrent. Il y eut des coups de feu, on entendit un grand cri, puis un plongeon, avec un brusque rejaillissement d’écume. Le pont était évidemment gardé.","And he did not feel a little safe until he had led Maurice down the bank stairway, to the left of the Pont Royal, downstream. There, under the clump of tall trees, by the water's edge, they were hidden. For nearly a quarter of an hour, black shadows moving opposite, on the other platform, worried them. There were shots, a great cry was heard, then a dive, with a sudden splash of foam. The bridge was obviously guarded.","He didn’t feel the slightest bit safer until he had got Maurice down the steps to the towpath to the left of the Pont Royal, downstream. They remained hidden there under the big trees by the water. For a quarter of an hour they were worried about some black figures moving about on the opposite bank. Some shots were fired, there was a shriek and something plopped into the water throwing up a big splash. Obviously the bridge was guarded.","And it was only when he had helped Maurice down the steps to the left and a little way down stream from the bridge that he felt somewhat easy in mind. There was a clump of tall trees standing on the bank of the stream, whose shadow gave them a measure of security. For near a quarter of an hour the dark forms moving to and fro on the opposite quai kept them in a fever of apprehension. There was firing, a scream was heard, succeeded by a loud splash, and the bosom of the river was disturbed. The bridge was evidently guarded."
"– Mon pauvre enfant, ayez du courage… Ce ne sera rien, on vous sauvera…","– My poor child, have courage… It will be nothing, we will save you…","‘Poor old chap, be brave… It won’t be anything much, and they’ll soon put you right.’","“Cheer up, my poor boy; have courage. You are in no danger; the doctors will save your leg.”"
"Huit longs jours encore s’écoulèrent. Paris agonisait, sans une plainte. Les boutiques ne s’ouvraient plus, les rares passants ne rencontraient plus de voitures, dans les rues désertes. On avait mangé quarante mille chevaux, on en était arrivé à payer très cher les chiens, les chats et les rats. Depuis que le blé manquait, le pain, fait de riz et d’avoine, était un pain noir, visqueux, d’une digestion difficile ; et, pour en obtenir les trois cents grammes du rationnement, les queues interminables, devant les boulangeries, devenaient mortelles. Ah ! ces douloureuses stations du siège, ces pauvres femmes grelottantes sous les averses, les pieds dans la boue glacée, toute la misère héroïque de la grande ville qui ne voulait pas se rendre ! La mortalité avait triplé, les théâtres étaient transformés en ambulances. Dès la nuit, les anciens quartiers luxueux tombaient à une paix morne, à des ténèbres profondes, pareils à des faubourgs de cité maudite, ravagée par la peste. Et, dans ce silence, dans cette obscurité, on n’entendait que le fracas continu du bombardement, on ne voyait que les éclairs des canons, qui embrasaient le ciel d’hiver.","Another eight long days passed. Paris was dying, without a complaint. The shops no longer opened, the rare passers-by no longer encountered cars in the deserted streets. We had eaten forty thousand horses, we had come to pay very dearly for dogs, cats and rats. Since the shortage of wheat, the bread, made of rice and oats, was a black, viscous bread, difficult to digest; and, to obtain the three hundred grammes of the ration, the interminable queues in front of the bakeries became deadly. Ah! those painful stations of the siege, those poor women shivering under the showers, their feet in the icy mud, all the heroic misery of the great city which refused to surrender! Mortality had tripled, theaters were transformed into ambulances. At night, the old luxurious quarters fell into a gloomy peace, into deep darkness, like the suburbs of a cursed city, ravaged by the plague. And, in this silence, in this darkness, one only heard the continuous din of the bombardment, one saw only the flashes of the cannons, which set the winter sky ablaze.","Eight more long days dragged on. Paris was in its death-throes, but never complained. Shops no longer opened, and the few people walking about never saw a vehicle in the deserted streets. Forty thousand horses had been eaten, and now dogs, cats and rats were becoming expensive. Since corn had vanished, the bread, made of rice and oats, was black, clammy and most indigestible, and to get the ration of three hundred grammes the interminable queues in front of bakers’ shops were becoming killing. What a painful business these waits were in the siege, when poor women shivered in pouring rain, with their feet in freezing mud! It was the heroic misery of a great city that refused to give in. The death rate had tripled, and theatres had been turned into hospitals. By nightfall the formerly fashionable neighbourhoods fell into a gloomy silence and pitch darkness, like quarters of an accursed city ravaged by plague. In the silence and darkness the only thing to be heard was the ceaseless din of the bombardment, and the only thing to be seen the flashes of guns lighting up the winter sky.","Then a long week went by, during which Paris lay agonizing without a murmur. The shops had ceased to open their doors; in the lonely streets the infrequent wayfarer never met a carriage. Forty thousand horses had been eaten; dogs, cats and rats were now luxuries, commanding a high price. Ever since the supply of wheat had given out the bread was made from rice and oats, and was black, damp, and slimy, and hard to digest; to obtain the ten ounces that constituted a day's ration involved a wait, often of many hours, in line before the bake-house. Ah, the sorrowful spectacle it was, to see those poor women shivering in the pouring rain, their feet in the ice-cold mud and water! the misery and heroism of the great city that would not surrender! The death rate had increased threefold; the theaters were converted into hospitals. As soon as it became dark the quarters where luxury and vice had formerly held carnival were shrouded in funereal blackness, like the faubourgs of some accursed city, smitten by pestilence. And in that silence, in that obscurity, naught was to be heard save the unceasing roar of the cannonade and the crash of bursting shells, naught to be seen save the red flash of the guns illuminating the wintry sky."
"Le cœur serré, Maurice, qui allait attaquer un morceau de gruyère, remarqua leurs yeux voraces, fixés sur son assiette.","Heartbroken, Maurice, who was about to attack a piece of Gruyere, noticed their voracious eyes, fixed on his plate.","Deeply touched, Maurice, on the point of attacking a piece of Gruyère, noticed their eyes staring voraciously at his plate.","Maurice, who had a piece of Gruyere before him, noticed the hungry eyes fixed on his plate."
"– Mais il n’y est pas, il n’y est pas !… Vous aurez mal vu… Oui ! une idée comme ça, une idée fausse qui vous aura passé par les yeux !","– But he is not there, he is not there!... You will have seen badly... Yes! an idea like that, a false idea that will have passed through your eyes!","‘But he’s not here, he’s not here! You can’t have seen properly… Yes, it must have been one of those funny ideas that made you see things!’","“He is not here! He is not here! You cannot have seen aright. Yes, that is it; some delusion must have cheated your eyes.”"
"Mais un souvenir, pourtant, restait très net dans la mémoire de Maurice : sa rencontre brusque avec Jean. Depuis trois jours, ce dernier se trouvait à Paris, où il était arrivé sans un sou, hâve encore, épuisé par la fièvre de deux mois qui l’avait retenu au fond d’un hôpital de Bruxelles ; et, tout de suite, ayant retrouvé un ancien capitaine du 106e, le capitaine Ravaud, il s’était fait engager dans la nouvelle compagnie du 124e, que celui-ci commandait. Il y avait repris ses galons de caporal, il venait, ce soir-là, de quitter justement la caserne du Prince-Eugène le dernier, avec son escouade, pour gagner la rive gauche, où toute l’armée avait reçu l’ordre de se concentrer, lorsque, sur le boulevard Saint-Martin, un flot de foule arrêta ses hommes. On criait, on parlait de les désarmer. Très calme, il répondait qu’on lui fichât la paix, que tout ça ne le regardait pas, qu’il voulait simplement obéir à sa consigne, sans faire de mal à personne. Mais il y eut un cri de surprise, Maurice qui s’était approché, se jetait à son cou, l’embrassait fraternellement.","But one memory, however, remained very clear in Maurice's memory: his sudden encounter with Jean. For three days the latter had been in Paris, where he had arrived penniless, still emaciated, exhausted by the fever of two months which had kept him at the bottom of a hospital in Brussels; and, having immediately found a former captain of the 106th, Captain Ravaud, he had himself engaged in the new company of the 124th, which the latter commanded. He had resumed his corporal's stripes there, he had just that evening left the barracks of Prince-Eugene the last, with his squad, to reach the left bank, where the whole army had received the order to to concentrate, when, on the boulevard Saint-Martin, a flood of crowd stopped his men. We were shouting, we were talking about disarming them. Very calm, he replied that he should be left alone, that all that was none of his business, that he simply wanted to obey his instructions, without hurting anyone. But there was a cry of surprise, Maurice, who had approached, threw himself on her neck, kissed her fraternally.","Yet there was one memory that stayed quite clear in Maurice ’s mind – his sudden meeting with Jean. The latter had been in Paris for three days, having reached there penniless and still emaciated and run down by two months of fever that had kept him in a Brussels hospital, and having found a former captain of the 106th, Captain Ravaud, he had at once joined up in the new company of the 124th under his command. He had regained his corporal’s stripes and that evening had been the last to leave the Prince Eugene barracks, with his squad, to go across to the left bank where the whole army was under orders to concentrate, when a dense crowd had brought them to a halt. There was a lot of shouting and talk of disarming the soldiers. He was quite coolly telling them to bugger off, and all this was nothing to do with him – he was just carrying out orders and doing no harm to anybody – when he uttered a cry of amazement, for Maurice rushed up and threw his arms round him in an affectionate embrace.","There was one memory, however, that remained very distinct to Maurice's mind: his unexpected meeting with Jean. It was three days now since the latter had reached Paris, without a sou in his pocket, emaciated and enfeebled by the illness that had consigned him to a hospital in Brussels and kept him there two months, and having had the luck to fall in with Captain Ravaud, who had commanded a company in the 106th, he had enlisted at once in his former acquaintance's new company in the 124th. His old rank as corporal had been restored to him, and that evening he had just left the Prince Eugene barracks with his squad on his way to the left bank, where the entire army was to concentrate, when a mob collected about his men and stopped them as they were passing along the boulevard Saint-Martin. The insurgents yelled and shouted, and evidently were preparing to disarm his little band. With perfect coolness he told them to let him alone, that he had no business with them or their affairs; all he wanted was to obey his orders without harming anybody. Then a cry of glad surprise was heard, and Maurice, who had chanced to pass that way, threw himself on the other's neck and gave him a brotherly hug."
"Combette, le pharmacien, un petit homme sec et remuant, rentra chez lui, très excité par tout ce qu’il venait de voir et d’entendre. Il semblait être dans le secret des choses, étant adjoint au maire. C’était vers trois heures et demie que Mac-Mahon avait télégraphié à Bazaine que l’arrivée du prince royal de Prusse à Châlons le forçait à se replier sur les places du Nord ; et une autre dépêche allait partir pour le ministre de la guerre, l’avertissant également de la retraite, lui expliquant le danger terrible où se trouvait l’armée d’être coupée et écrasée. La dépêche à Bazaine pouvait courir, si elle avait de bonnes jambes, car toutes les communications semblaient interrompues avec Metz depuis plusieurs jours. Mais, l’autre dépêche, c’était plus grave ; et, baissant la voix, le pharmacien raconta qu’il avait entendu un officier supérieur dire : « S’ils sont prévenus à Paris, nous sommes foutus ! » Personne n’ignorait avec quelle âpreté l’impératrice-régente et le conseil des ministres poussaient à la marche en avant. D’ailleurs, la confusion augmentait d’heure en heure, les renseignements les plus extraordinaires arrivaient sur l’approche des armées allemandes. Le prince royal de Prusse à Châlons, était-ce possible ? Et contre quelles troupes venait donc de se heurter le 7e corps, dans les défilés de l’Argonne ?","Combette, the pharmacist, a lean, restless little man, returned home, very excited by all he had just seen and heard. He seemed to be in on the secret, being deputy mayor. It was about half-past three that Mac-Mahon had telegraphed Bazaine that the arrival of the Prince Royal of Prussia at Châlons was forcing him to withdraw to the northern squares; and another despatch was about to leave for the Minister of War, also warning him of the retreat, explaining to him the terrible danger in which the army lay of being cut off and crushed. The despatch to Bazaine could run if it had good legs, for all communications with Metz seemed to have been interrupted for several days. But the other dispatch was more serious; and, lowering his voice, the pharmacist related that he had heard a superior officer say: ""If they are warned in Paris, we are done for!"" No one was unaware of the bitterness with which the Empress-Regent and the Council of Ministers pushed forward. Besides, the confusion was increasing hour by hour, the most extraordinary information was arriving on the approach of the German armies. The Prince Royal of Prussia at Châlons, was it possible? And against which troops had the 7th corps come into collision, in the defiles of the Argonne?","Combette the chemist, a bustling little man, came in very excited by all he had seen and heard. He seemed to be in the know, being deputy mayor. It appeared that at about half past three MacMahon had wired Bazaine that the arrival of the Crown Prince of Prussia at Châlons forced him to fall back on the northern fortresses, and another telegram was going off to the Minister of War warning him also about the retreat, explaining the terrible danger the army was in of being cut off and annihilated. The wire to Bazaine could run there if it had good legs, for all communication with Metz seemed to have been cut off for some days. But the other wire was more disturbing, and lowering his voice the chemist said he had heard a high officer say: ‘If anybody tells them in Paris, we’re up the spout!’ Everybody was aware of the pertinacity with which the Empress-Regent and the cabinet were urging an advance. Anyhow the confusion was getting worse every hour, and the most extraordinary tales came in about the approaching German armies. The Crown Prince of Prussia at Châlons – was it possible? Then, what troops had the 7th corps run into in the gorges of the Argonne?","Combette, a bustling, wizened little man, came in from the street in a great state of excitement from all that he had seen and heard. His position as deputy-mayor gave him facilities for knowing what was going on. It was about half-past three o'clock when MacMahon had telegraphed Bazaine that the Crown Prince of Prussia was approaching Chalons, thus necessitating the withdrawal of the army to the places along the Belgian frontier, and further dispatches were also in preparation for the Minister of War, advising him of the projected movement and explaining the terrible dangers of their position. It was uncertain whether or not the dispatch for Bazaine would get through, for communication with Metz had seemed to be interrupted for the past few days, but the second dispatch was another and more serious matter; and lowering his voice almost to a whisper the apothecary repeated the words that he had heard uttered by an officer of rank: “If they get wind of this in Paris, our goose is cooked!” Everyone was aware of the unrelenting persistency with which the Empress and the Council of Ministers urged the advance of the army. Moreover, the confusion went on increasing from hour to hour, the most conflicting advices were continually coming in as to the whereabouts of the German forces. Could it be possible that the Crown Prince was at Chalons? What, then, were the troops that the 7th corps had encountered among the passes of the Argonne?"
"– Mon lieutenant, expliqua un zouave à Rochas, ce sont des salops de Prussiens, que nous avons trouvés en train de tout saccager ici. Vous voyez, nous leur avons réglé leur compte… Seulement, les salops reviennent dix contre un, ça ne va pas être commode.","“Lieutenant,” a Zouave explained to Rochas, “these are some Prussian bastards we found looting everything here. You see, we've settled their account… Only, the bastards come back ten against one, it's not going to be easy.","‘Sir,’ a Zouave told Rochas, ‘we found those Prussian sods in the middle of sacking everything. You can see we’ve put paid to their account… Only the buggers always come back ten to one, and it’s not going to be a picnic.’","“Lieutenant,” a zouave said to Rochas, by way of explanation, “we found a pack of those dirty Prussian hounds here, smashing things and raising Cain generally. We settled their hash for them, as you can see for yourself; only they will be coming back here presently, ten to our one, and that won't be so pleasant.”"
"Maurice, l’estomac délabré, eut un cri de regret.","Maurice, his stomach crumbling, gave a cry of regret.","Maurice, whose stomach was in a bad way, moaned:","Maurice, who began to feel a twinging sensation in his stomach, uttered a regretful cry:"
"Prosper, voulant couper au plus court, avait résolu de traverser Sedan. Mais, avant Pont-Maugis, un poste prussien arrêta la charrette, la retint pendant plus d’une heure ; et, lorsque le laissez-passer eut circulé entre les mains de quatre ou cinq chefs, l’âne put reprendre sa marche, à la condition de faire le grand tour par Bazeilles, en s’engageant à gauche dans un chemin de traverse. Aucune raison ne fut donnée, sans doute craignait-on d’encombrer la ville davantage. Quand Silvine passa la Meuse sur le pont du chemin de fer, ce pont funeste qu’on n’avait pas fait sauter et qui du reste avait coûté si cher aux Bavarois, elle aperçut le cadavre d’un artilleur descendant d’un air de flânerie, au fil de l’eau. Une touffe d’herbe l’accrocha, il demeura un instant immobile, puis il tourna sur lui-même, il repartit.","Prosper, wanting to cut as short as possible, had resolved to cross Sedan. But, before Pont-Maugis, a Prussian post stopped the cart, detained it for more than an hour; and, when the pass had passed through the hands of four or five chiefs, the donkey could resume its march, on condition of making the grand tour by Bazeilles, taking a side road to the left. No reason was given, no doubt they feared to encumber the city more. When Silvine crossed the Meuse over the railway bridge, that fatal bridge which had not been blown up and which, moreover, had cost the Bavarians so dear, she saw the corpse of an artilleryman descending with an air of stroll along the water. A tuft of grass caught him, he remained motionless for a moment, then he turned on himself, he started again.","Prosper had made up his mind to take the shortest route by going straight through Sedan. But just before Pont-Maugis a Prussian post stopped the trap and held it up for over an hour, and when the pass had been through the hands of several officers the donkey was allowed to go on its way on condition that it went the long way round through Bazeilles by taking a side road to the left. No reason was given – perhaps they were afraid of adding to the traffic in the town. When Silvine crossed the Meuse by the railway bridge, that fatal bridge that had not been blown up, and which incidentally had cost the Bavarians so many lives, she saw the body of an artilleryman floating down as though he were having a nice swim. He was caught by a tuft of grass, stayed still a moment, then turned over and set off again.","Prosper, wishing to save all the distance he could, had determined on taking the route that lay through the city of Sedan, but before they reached Pont-Maugis a Prussian outpost halted the cart and held it for over an hour, and finally, after their pass had been referred, one after another, to four or five officials, they were told they might resume their journey, but only on condition of taking the longer, roundabout route by way of Bazeilles, to do which they would have to turn into a cross-road on their left. No reason was assigned; their object was probably to avoid adding to the crowd that encumbered the streets of the city. When Silvine crossed the Meuse by the railroad bridge, that ill-starred bridge that the French had failed to destroy and which, moreover, had been the cause of such slaughter among the Bavarians, she beheld the corpse of an artilleryman floating lazily down with the sluggish current. It caught among some rushes near the bank, hung there a moment, then swung clear and started afresh on its downward way."
"Au retour de ses longues stations inutiles devant le hangar, Jean, malgré son calme habituel, s’emportait.","Coming back from his long useless stops in front of the shed, Jean, despite his usual calm, lost his temper.","When he got back from these long fruitless waits in front of the shed, Jean, usually so phlegmatic, lost his temper.","On his return from his wearisome and fruitless expedition to the shed, Jean forgot his usual placidity and gave way to anger."
"C’était encore une charge des chevaux errants, libres et affamés. Ils arrivaient cette fois par un vaste chaume plat, en une masse profonde, les crinières au vent, les naseaux couverts d’écume ; et un rayon oblique du rouge soleil projetait à l’autre bout du plateau le vol frénétique de leur course. Tout de suite, Silvine s’était jetée devant la charrette, les deux bras en l’air, comme pour les arrêter, d’un geste de furieuse épouvante. Heureusement, ils dévièrent à gauche, détournés par une pente du terrain. Ils auraient tout broyé. La terre tremblait, leurs sabots lancèrent une pluie de cailloux, une grêle de mitraille qui blessa l’âne à la tête. Et ils disparurent, au fond d’un ravin.","It was another load of wandering horses, free and hungry. They came this time through a vast flat stubble, in a deep mass, their manes in the wind, their nostrils covered with foam; and an oblique ray of the red sun projected across the plateau the frantic flight of their course. Immediately, Silvine had thrown herself in front of the cart, both arms in the air, as if to stop them, with a gesture of furious terror. Fortunately, they deviated to the left, diverted by a slope of the ground. They would have crushed everything. The earth shook, their hooves threw up a shower of pebbles, a hail of grapeshot that injured the donkey in the head. And they disappeared, at the bottom of a ravine.","It was another charge of the horses roaming at large and famished. This time they were coming across a huge flat field in a solid mass, manes flying and nostrils flecked with foam, and a slanting ray of the red sun sent the shadow of their frantic race right across the plain. Silvine at once threw herself in front of the trap with her arms in the air as though to stop them with a gesture of fury and fear. Mercifully they swerved to the left, turned aside by the slope of the land. They would have pounded everything to pieces. The earth shook and their hoofs sent up a shower of stones like a hail of shrapnel that hurt the donkey’s head. Then they vanished into a deep ravine.","It was the starving, abandoned cavalry mounts making another charge. They came up this time in a deep mass across a wide, smooth field, manes and tails streaming in the wind, froth flying from their nostrils, and the level rays of the fiery setting sun sent the shadow of the infuriated herd clean across the plateau. Silvine rushed forward and planted herself before the cart, raising her arms above her head as if her puny form might have power to check them. Fortunately the ground fell off just at that point, causing them to swerve to the left; otherwise they would have crushed donkey, cart, and all to powder. The earth trembled, and their hoofs sent a volley of clods and small stones flying through the air, one of which struck the donkey on the head and wounded him. The last that was seen of them they were tearing down a ravine."
"– Comment, c’est toi ! Pourquoi donc ? puisque nous allions te reprendre !","- What, it's you! Why is that ? since we were going to take you back!","‘What, you! Why? We were going to pick you up!’","“What, is it you? What is the meaning of this? I thought you were to wait until we came along.”"
"Et l’intimité de Jean et d’Henriette, alors, se trouva réglée. Des habitudes leur vinrent, il leur semblait qu’ils n’avaient jamais vécu autrement, qu’ils devaient toujours vivre ainsi. Elle passait avec lui toutes les heures qu’elle ne donnait pas à l’ambulance, veillait à ce qu’il bût, à ce qu’il mangeât régulièrement, l’aidait à se retourner, d’une force de poignet qu’on n’aurait pas soupçonnée dans ses bras minces. Parfois ils causaient ensemble, le plus souvent ils ne disaient rien, surtout dans les commencements. Mais jamais ils n’avaient l’air de s’ennuyer, c’était une vie très douce, au fond de ce grand repos, lui tout massacré encore de la bataille, elle en robe de deuil, le cœur broyé par la perte qu’elle venait de faire. D’abord, il avait éprouvé quelque gêne, car il sentait bien qu’elle était au-dessus de lui, presque une dame, tandis qu’il n’avait jamais été qu’un paysan et qu’un soldat. À peine savait-il lire et écrire. Puis, il s’était rassuré un peu, en voyant qu’elle le traitait sans fierté, comme son égal, ce qui l’avait enhardi à se montrer ce qu’il était, intelligent à sa manière, à force de tranquille raison. D’ailleurs, lui-même s’étonnait d’avoir la sensation de s’être aminci, allégé, avec des idées nouvelles : était-ce l’abominable vie qu’il menait depuis deux mois ? il sortait affiné de tant de souffrances physiques et morales. Mais ce qui acheva de le conquérir, ce fut de comprendre qu’elle n’en savait pas beaucoup plus que lui. Toute jeune, après la mort de sa mère, devenue la cendrillon, la petite ménagère ayant la charge de ses trois hommes, comme elle disait, son grand-père, son père et son frère, elle n’avait pas eu le temps d’apprendre. La lecture, l’écriture, un peu d’orthographe et de calcul, il ne fallait point lui en demander davantage. Et elle ne l’intimidait encore, elle ne lui apparaissait bien au-dessus de toutes les autres, que parce qu’il la savait d’une bonté supérieure, d’un courage extraordinaire, sous son apparence de petite femme effacée qui se plaisait aux menus soins de la vie.","And the intimacy of Jean and Henriette, then, was settled. Habits came to them, it seemed to them that they had never lived otherwise, that they always had to live like this. She spent all the hours with him that she didn't give to the ambulance, saw that he drank, that he ate regularly, helped him to turn over, with the strength of her wrist that one could would not have suspected in her slender arms. Sometimes they talked together, more often they said nothing, especially at the beginning. But they never seemed to be bored, it was a very sweet life, in the depths of this great rest, he still massacred from the battle, she in mourning dress, her heart crushed by the loss that she had just done. At first he had felt some embarrassment, for he felt that she was above him, almost a lady, whereas he had never been anything but a peasant and a soldier. He barely knew how to read and write. Then he had reassured himself a little, seeing that she treated him without pride, as her equal, which had emboldened him to show himself what he was, intelligent in his own way, by dint of calm reason. Moreover, he himself was surprised to have the feeling of having become thinner, lighter, with new ideas: was this the abominable life he had been leading for two months? he emerged refined from so much physical and moral suffering. But what won him over was realizing that she didn't know much more than he did. Very young, after the death of her mother, who had become the Cinderella, the little housewife having the charge of her three men, as she said, her grandfather, her father and her brother, she had not had time to to learn. Reading, writing, a little spelling and arithmetic, you couldn't ask him for more. And she still only intimidated him, she appeared to him far above all the others, only because he knew her to be of superior kindness, of extraordinary courage, under her appearance of a small, self-effacing woman who liked to the small cares of life.","And so Jean and Henriette settled down to a regular life together. They fell into a routine and it seemed as though they had never lived any other way and would go on living like this. All the time she was not at the hospital she spent with him, seeing that he ate and drank regularly, helping him to turn over with a strength of wrist one would not have suspected in such slender arms. Sometimes they talked, but more often said nothing, especially in the early days. But they never seemed bored; it was a very peaceful life in this most restful atmosphere – for him, still shattered by the battle, and for her, in her mourning dress, still heartbroken after her recent loss. At first he felt a little awkward because he was aware that she was above him in station, almost a grand lady, while he had never been anything more than a peasant and soldier. He could only just about read and write. But later he felt somewhat reassured when he saw that she treated him without any pride, as an equal, and that gave him the courage to show that he was intelligent in his own way, through his sweet reasonableness. Moreover he himself was amazed to feel that he had become more refined, more agile in mind, with new ideas. Was it something to do with the abominable life he had been leading for two months? He had emerged more delicate-minded from so much physical and moral suffering. But what finally reassured him was that he realized that she did not know all that much more than he did. After the death of her mother she had become at a very early age the Cinderella, the little housewife looking after her three men, as she called them – her grandfather, father and brother – and she had not had time for study. Reading, writing, a bit of spelling and arithmetic was about as far as she could go. The only reason why she still intimidated him and seemed so far above all other women was that he knew that beneath her exterior of an unremarkable little person, occupied with the trivial affairs of daily life, was a woman of the greatest goodness and the utmost courage.","Then Jean's and Henriette's relations began to be established on a more systematic basis. Fixed habits commenced to prevail; it seemed to them that they had never lived otherwise—that they were to go on living forever in that way. All the hours and moments that she did not devote to the ambulance were spent with him; she saw to it that he had his food and drink at proper intervals. She assisted him to turn in bed with a strength of wrist that no one, seeing her slender arms, would have supposed was in her. At times they would converse; but as a general thing, especially in the earlier days, they had not much to say. They never seemed to tire of each other's company, though. On the whole it was a very pleasant life they led in that calm, restful atmosphere, he with the horrible scenes of the battlefield still fresh in his memory, she in her widow's weeds, her heart bruised and bleeding with the great loss she had sustained. At first he had experienced a sensation of embarrassment, for he felt she was his superior, almost a lady, indeed, while he had never been aught more than a common soldier and a peasant. He could barely read and write. When finally he came to see that she affected no airs of superiority, but treated him on the footing of an equal, his confidence returned to him in a measure and he showed himself in his true colors, as a man of intelligence by reason of his sound, unpretentious common sense. Besides, he was surprised at times to think he could note a change was gradually coming over him; it seemed to him that his mind was less torpid than it had been, that it was clearer and more active, that he had novel ideas in his head, and more of them; could it be that the abominable life he had been leading for the last two months, his horrible sufferings, physical and moral, had exerted a refining influence on him? But that which assisted him most to overcome his shyness was to find that she was really not so very much wiser than he. She was but a little child when, at her mother's death, she became the household drudge, with her three men to care for, as she herself expressed it—her grandfather, her father, and her brother— and she had not had the time to lay in a large stock of learning. She could read and write, could spell words that were not too long, and “do sums,” if they were not too intricate; and that was the extent of her acquirement. And if she continued to intimidate him still, if he considered her far and away the superior of all other women upon earth, it was because he knew the ineffable tenderness, the goodness of heart, the unflinching courage, that animated that frail little body, who went about her duties silently and met them as if they had been pleasures."
"Dans la confusion de la retraite, le long du canal du Rhône au Rhin, près du pont, le 106e dut s’arrêter, au premier kilomètre de l’étape. Les ordres de marche, mal donnés et plus mal exécutés encore, venaient d’accumuler là toute la 2e division ; et le passage était si étroit, un passage de cinq mètres à peine, que le défilé s’éternisait.","In the confusion of the retreat, along the Canal du Rhône au Rhin, near the bridge, the 106th had to stop at the first kilometer of the stage. The marching orders, badly given and even worse executed, had just piled up the whole 2nd Division there; and the passage was so narrow, a passage of barely five meters, that the procession dragged on.","In the confusion of the retreat, along the Rhône–Rhine canal, the 106th had to halt after only one kilometre. Marching orders, badly expressed and even more badly carried out, had jammed the whole 2nd division at this point, and the way through was so narrow, scarcely five metres wide, that the procession looked like going on for ever.","In the hurry and confusion of the movement the 106th was brought to a halt at the very first kilometer of their march, near the bridge over the canal of the Rhone and Rhine. The order of march had been badly planned and still more badly executed, so that the entire 2d division was collected there in a huddle, and the way was so narrow, barely more than sixteen feet in width, that the passage of the troops was obstructed."
"La nuit, de nouveau, on n’eut pas besoin de les bercer. Les six digérèrent la bête, à poings fermés. Et ils eurent à remercier le caporal de la façon solide dont il avait planté la tente, car ils ne s’aperçurent même pas d’un violent coup de vent qui souffla vers deux heures, accompagné d’une rafale de pluie : des tentes furent emportées, des hommes réveillés en sursaut, trempés, forcés de courir au milieu des ténèbres ; tandis que la leur résistait et qu’ils étaient bien à couvert, sans une goutte d’eau, grâce aux rigoles où ruisselait l’averse.","At night, again, there was no need to rock them. The six digested the beast, with closed fists. And they had to thank the corporal for the solid way in which he had pitched the tent, for they did not even notice a violent gust of wind which blew around two o'clock, accompanied by a gust of rain: tents were carried away, men awakened with a start, soaked, forced to run in the middle of the darkness; while theirs resisted and they were well covered, without a drop of water, thanks to the channels where the downpour trickled.","They didn’t need rocking to sleep that night either. All six were digesting the bird for all they were worth. And they had the corporal to thank for the solid way he had pitched the tent, for they didn’t even notice a violent squall at about two in the morning, with a deluge of rain; tents were blown away, men woke up in a panic, soaked to the skin and forced to run for it in the dark, but theirs stood up to it and they were perfectly sheltered, without a single drop of wet, thanks to the gulleys that took away the storm water.","That night again the six men required no rocking; they digested their dinner while sleeping the sleep of the just. They had reason to thank the corporal for the scientific way in which he had set up their tent, for they were not even conscious of a small hurricane that blew up about two o'clock, accompanied by a sharp down-pour of rain; some of the tents were blown down, and the men, wakened out of their sound slumber, were drenched and had to scamper in the pitchy darkness, while theirs stood firm and they were warm and dry, thanks to the ingenious device of the trench."
"Lorsque la marmite fut enfin au feu, pleine d’eau, avec la viande dedans, la nuit noire était venue. Loubet avait épluché les betteraves, pour les faire cuire dans le bouillon, un vrai fricot de l’autre monde, comme il disait ; et tous activaient la flamme, en poussant sous la marmite les débris de la brouette. Leurs grandes ombres dansaient bizarrement, au fond de ce trou de roches. Puis, il leur devint impossible d’attendre davantage, ils se jetèrent sur le bouillon immonde, ils se partagèrent la viande avec leurs doigts égarés et tremblants, sans prendre le temps d’employer le couteau. Mais, malgré eux, leur cœur se soulevait. Ils souffraient surtout du manque de sel, leur estomac se refusait à garder cette bouillie fade des betteraves, ces morceaux de chair à moitié cuite, gluante, d’un goût d’argile. Presque tout de suite, des vomissements se déclarèrent. Pache ne put continuer, Chouteau et Loubet injurièrent cette satanée rosse de cheval, qu’ils avaient eu tant de peine à mettre en pot-au-feu, et qui leur fichait la colique. Seul, Lapoulle dîna copieusement ; mais il faillit en crever, la nuit, lorsqu’il fut retourné avec les trois autres, sous les peupliers du canal, pour y dormir.","When the pot was finally on the fire, full of water, with the meat in it, the dark night had come. Loubet had peeled the beets, to cook them in the broth, a real fricot from the other world, as he said; and they all kindled the flame, pushing the remains of the wheelbarrow under the pot. Their great shadows danced strangely at the bottom of this hole of rocks. Then, it became impossible for them to wait any longer, they threw themselves on the filthy broth, they shared the meat with their wandering and trembling fingers, without taking the time to use the knife. But, in spite of themselves, their hearts were heaving. They suffered especially from the lack of salt, their stomachs refused to keep this bland porridge of beets, these pieces of half-cooked, sticky flesh, with a taste of clay. Almost immediately, vomiting started. Pache couldn't go on, Chouteau and Loubet cursed that damn horse whore, which they had had so much trouble putting in a pot-au-feu, and which was giving them the colic. Alone, Lapoulle dined copiously; but he almost died of it at night, when he was returned with the three others, under the poplars of the canal, to sleep there.","By the time the pan was on the fire, full of water and with the meat in it, it was really dark. Loubet had peeled the beetroots so as to cook them in the broth – a stew that would be out of this world, as he put it – and they all kept the flames up by pushing pieces of the barrow under the pan. Their long shadows danced weirdly in this rocky cavern. But then they could wait no longer and threw themselves on to this disgusting brew and tore the meat into shares with wild, impatient fingers, without waiting to use a knife. But all the same it made them heave. It was the lack of salt in particular that upset them, for their stomachs refused to keep down this insipid mess of beetroot and bits of half-cooked, gluey meat tasting like earth. Almost at once they began throwing it up. Pache could not go on, Chouteau and Loubet cursed the devil’s own nag they had had so much trouble to turn into a stew and which was now giving them the belly-ache. Lapoulle was the only one who dined copiously, but later in the night it nearly did him in when he had gone back with the three others to sleep under the poplars.","By the time they got the kettle filled and on the fire it was quite dark. Loubet had peeled the beets and thrown them into the water to cook—a feast fit for the gods, he declared it would be—and fed the fire with fragments of the wheelbarrow, for they were all suffering so from hunger that they could have eaten the meat before the pot began to boil. Their huge shadows danced fantastically in the firelight on the rocky walls of the quarry. Then they found it impossible longer to restrain their appetite, and threw themselves upon the unclean mess, tearing the flesh with eager, trembling fingers and dividing it among them, too impatient even to make use of the knife. But, famishing as they were, their stomachs revolted; they felt the want of salt, they could not swallow that tasteless, sickening broth, those chunks of half-cooked, viscid meat that had a taste like clay. Some among them had a fit of vomiting. Pache was very ill. Chouteau and Loubet heaped maledictions on that infernal old nag, that had caused them such trouble to get him to the pot and then given them the colic. Lapoulle was the only one among them who ate abundantly, but he was in a very bad way that night when, with his three comrades, he returned to their resting-place under the poplars by the canal."
"– Puis, il y a trop de travail ici, maintenant. Voilà les grands labours qui viennent, ensuite ce seront les semailles. Faut aussi songer à la terre, n’est-ce pas ? parce que ça va bien de se battre, mais qu’est-ce qu’on deviendrait, si l’on ne labourait plus ?… Vous comprenez, je ne peux pas lâcher l’ouvrage. Ce n’est pas que le père Fouchard soit raisonnable, car je me doute que je ne verrai guère la couleur de son argent ; mais les bêtes commencent à m’aimer, et ma foi ! ce matin, pendant que j’étais, là-haut, dans la pièce du Vieux-Clos, je regardais au loin ce sacré Sedan, je me sentais quand même tout réconforté, d’être tout seul, au grand soleil, avec mes bêtes, à pousser ma charrue !","– Then, there is too much work here, now. Here comes the great plowing, then it will be the sowing. You also have to think about the land, right? because it's fine to fight, but what would become of us if we stopped plowing?... You understand, I can't let go of the work. It is not that Father Fouchard is reasonable, for I suspect that I will hardly see the color of his money; but the beasts are beginning to love me, and my faith! this morning, while I was up there in the room in the Vieux-Clos, I was looking at that sacred Sedan in the distance, I still felt very comforted, to be all alone, in the bright sun, with my animals , to push my plow!","‘Besides, there’s too much work to do here. The big ploughing is coming soon, and then there will be the sowing. You’ve got to think of the land as well, haven’t you? Because of course it’s all very well to fight, but what would become of us all if we didn’t plough the fields? … You see, I can’t just leave the job. It isn’t that old Fouchard is much good, for I very much doubt whether I shall ever see the colour of his money, but the animals are beginning to take to me, and really this morning when I was up there in the Vieux-Clos and looked down at that bloody old Sedan in the distance I felt jolly glad to be on my own again in the bright sunshine with my animals and pushing my plough!’","There was silence between them for a moment; then he went on, doubtless to quiet the reproaches of his conscience as a soldier: “And then the work is too heavy here just now; the plowing is just commencing, and then there'll be the fall sowing to be looked after. We must think of the farm work, mustn't we? for fighting is well enough in its way, but what would become of us if we should cease to till the ground? You see how it is; I can't leave my work. Not that I am particularly in love with Father Fouchard, for I doubt very strongly if I shall ever see the color of his money, but the beasties are beginning to take to me, and faith! when I was up there in the Old Field this morning, and gave a look at that d——d Sedan lying yonder in the distance, you can't tell how good it made me feel to be guiding my oxen and driving the plow through the furrow, all alone in the bright sunshine.”"
"Dans Bazeilles, l’estafette galopait toujours, cherchant les chefs pour leur donner les ordres.

And the news also galloped, Marshal de Mac-Mahon wounded, General Ducrot appointed commander-in-chief, the whole army falling back on Illy.","In Bazeilles the dispatch-rider went on galloping, looking for officers to give orders to. And the news galloped too – Marshal MacMahon wounded, General Ducrot appointed commander-in-Chief, the whole army falling back on Illy.","The estafette tore through Bazeilles on a gallop, disseminating the news, hunting up the commanders to give them their instructions, and as he sped swiftly on the intelligence spread among the troops: Marshal MacMahon wounded, General Ducrot in command, the army falling back on Illy!"

"Dans la salle à manger, cependant, la cuisinière venait de servir des bols de café au lait pour tout le monde. Henriette et Gilberte s’étaient réveillées, cette dernière reposée par un bon sommeil, le visage clair, les yeux gais ; et elle embrassait tendrement son amie, qu’elle plaignait, disait-elle, du plus profond de son âme. Maurice se plaça près de sa sœur, tandis que Jean, un peu gauche, ayant dû accepter lui aussi, se trouva en face de Delaherche. Jamais madame Delaherche ne consentit à venir s’attabler, on lui porta un bol, qu’elle se contenta de boire. Mais, à côté, le déjeuner des cinq, d’abord silencieux, s’anima bientôt. On était délabré, on avait très faim, comment ne pas se réjouir de se retrouver là, intacts, bien portants, lorsque des milliers de pauvres diables couvraient encore les campagnes environnantes ? Dans la grande salle à manger fraîche, la nappe toute blanche était une joie pour les yeux, et le café au lait, très chaud, semblait exquis.","In the dining room, however, the cook had just served bowls of cafe au lait for everyone. Henriette and Gilberte had woken up, the latter rested by a good sleep, her face clear, her eyes gay; and she tenderly embraced her friend, whom she pitied, she said, from the depths of her soul. Maurice took his place near his sister, while Jean, a little clumsy, having also had to accept, found himself facing Delaherche. Madame Delaherche never consented to come and sit down to a table; a bowl was brought to her, which she contented herself with drinking. But, next door, the lunch of the five, silent at first, soon came alive. We were dilapidated, we were very hungry, how not to rejoice to find ourselves there, intact, in good health, when thousands of poor devils still covered the surrounding countryside? In the large, cool dining room, the all-white tablecloth was a delight to the eyes, and the very hot café au lait seemed exquisite.","Meanwhile in the dining-room cook had served bowls of coffee for everybody. Henriette and Gilberte were up, the latter refreshed after a good night’s sleep, with bright face and laughing eyes, and she tenderly embraced her friend Henriette, saying she felt for her from the depths of her heart. Maurice sat next to his sister while Jean, feeling a bit awkward, had to accept coffee, too, and sat opposite Delaherche. Madame Delaherche would not hear of sitting down at table, and she was taken a bowl which she agreed to drink. But the breakfast of the five people there, at first silent, soon livened up. They were all the worse for wear and very hungry, and how could they help being glad to be there alive and well when thousands of poor devils were still lying all over the countryside? In the big cool dining-room the snow-white cloth was a joy to look at, and the piping hot coffee and milk seemed delicious.","In the dining room the cook had meantime served bowls of hot coffee and milk for the entire party. Henriette and Gilberte had awakened, the latter, completely restored by her long and refreshing slumber, with bright eyes and smiling face; she embraced most tenderly her friend, whom she pitied, she said, from the bottom of her heart. Maurice seated himself beside his sister, while Jean, who was unused to polite society, but could not decline the invitation that was extended to him, was Delaherche's right-hand neighbor. It was Mme. Delaherche's custom not to come to the table with the family; a servant carried her a bowl, which she drank while sitting by the colonel. The party of five, however, who sat down together, although they commenced their meal in silence, soon became cheerful and talkative. Why should they not rejoice and be glad to find themselves there, safe and sound, with food before them to satisfy their hunger, when the country round about was covered with thousands upon thousands of poor starving wretches? In the cool, spacious dining room the snow-white tablecloth was a delight to the eye and the steaming cafe au lait seemed delicious."
"Puis, comme il revenait vers Bouroche, pour lui rappeler le capitaine, il eut l’étonnement de le trouver par terre, au milieu d’une botte de paille, couché sur le ventre, les deux bras nus jusqu’aux épaules, enfoncés dans deux seaux d’eau glacée. À bout de force morale et physique, le major se délassait là, anéanti, terrassé par une tristesse, une désolation immense, dans une de ces minutes d’agonie du praticien qui se sent impuissant. Celui-ci pourtant était un solide, une peau dure et un cœur ferme. Mais il venait d’être touché par l’« à quoi bon ? » Le sentiment qu’il ne ferait jamais tout, qu’il ne pouvait pas tout faire, l’avait brusquement paralysé. À quoi bon ? puisque la mort serait quand même la plus forte !","Then, as he returned to Bouroche, to remind him of the captain, he was astonished to find him on the ground, in the middle of a bale of straw, lying on his stomach, his two arms bare to the shoulders, buried in two buckets of ice water. At the end of his moral and physical strength, the major was relaxing there, devastated, overwhelmed by sadness, immense desolation, in one of those minutes of agony of the practitioner who feels helpless. This one, however, was solid, with hard skin and a firm heart. But he had just been touched by the “what’s the point? The feeling that he would never do everything, that he couldn't do everything, had suddenly paralyzed him. What's the point ? since death would still be the strongest!","Then as he was making for Bouroche to remind him about the captain, he was astonished to find him on a bale of straw on the ground, lying on his front with both arms bare to the shoulders and thrust into two buckets of ice-cold water. At the end of his moral and physical resources, the major was trying to relax like this, for he was stunned and knocked out by immense sadness and despair – at one of those moments when a practitioner is in agony over his own apparent powerlessness. Yet he was a strong man, thick-skinned and stout-hearted. But he had been struck by the ‘what’s the use?’ and the feeling that he would never do it all, could never do it all, had suddenly paralysed him. What was the use? Death would always come out the strongest!","Returning to Bouroche to remind him of his promise and conduct him to the captain, he was astonished to find him seated on a bundle of straw before two pails of iced water, into which he had plunged both his arms, bared to the shoulder. The major, weary and disheartened, overwhelmed by a sensation of deepest melancholy and dejection, had reached one of those terrible moments when the practitioner becomes conscious of his own impotency; he had exhausted his strength, physical and moral, and taken this means to restore it. And yet he was not a weakling; he was steady of hand and firm of heart; but the inexorable question had presented itself to him: “What is the use?” The feeling that he could accomplish so little, that so much must be left undone, had suddenly paralyzed him. What was the use? since Death, in spite of his utmost effort, would always be victorious."
"La petite ville est riche, avec ses nombreuses fabriques, sa grande rue bien bâtie aux deux bords de la route, son église et sa mairie coquettes. Seulement, la nuit qu’y avaient passée l’empereur et le maréchal de Mac-Mahon, dans l’encombrement de l’état-major et de la maison impériale, et le passage ensuite du 1er corps entier, qui, toute la matinée, avait coulé par la route comme un fleuve, venaient d’y épuiser les ressources, vidant les boulangeries et les épiceries, balayant jusqu’aux miettes des maisons bourgeoises. On ne trouvait plus de pain, plus de vin, plus de sucre, plus rien de ce qui se boit et de ce qui se mange. On avait vu des dames, devant leurs portes, distribuant des verres de vin et des tasses de bouillon, jusqu’à la dernière goutte des tonneaux et des marmites. Et c’était fini, et, lorsque les premiers régiments du 7e corps, vers trois heures, se mirent à défiler, ce fut un désespoir. Quoi donc ? ça recommençait, il y en avait toujours ! De nouveau, la grande rue charriait des hommes exténués, couverts de poussière, mourants de faim, sans qu’on eût une bouchée à leur donner. Beaucoup s’arrêtaient, frappaient aux portes, tendaient les mains vers les fenêtres, suppliant qu’on leur jetât un morceau de pain. Et il y avait des femmes qui sanglotaient, en leur faisant signe qu’elles ne pouvaient pas, qu’elles n’avaient plus rien.","The small town is rich, with its many factories, its well-built main street on both sides of the road, its pretty church and town hall. Only, the night that the Emperor and Marshal MacMahon had spent there, in the clutter of the staff and the imperial household, and the subsequent passage of the entire 1st Corps, which, all morning , had flowed by the road like a river, had just exhausted the resources there, emptying the bakeries and the grocers, sweeping up the crumbs from the bourgeois houses. There was no more bread, no more wine, no more sugar, nothing to drink or eat. Ladies had been seen, in front of their doors, distributing glasses of wine and cups of broth, to the last drop from barrels and pots. And it was all over, and when the first regiments of the 7th corps, around three o'clock, began to march past, there was despair. What ? it started again, there were always some! Again the main street was carrying exhausted men, covered with dust, dying of hunger, without a bite to give them. Many stopped, knocked on doors, held out their hands to the windows, begging for a piece of bread to be thrown to them. And there were women who were sobbing, making signs to them that they couldn't, that they had nothing left.","This little town is prosperous, with its numerous factories, main street with fine buildings on each side, its charming church and town hall. But the night spent there by the Emperor and Marshal MacMahon, with all the paraphernalia of General Headquarters and the imperial household, followed by the passage through the town of the whole of the 1st army corps which had flowed along the street all the morning like a river, had exhausted all the town’s resources, emptying bakeries and grocers’ and making a clean sweep even of the crumbs in the townspeople’s homes. There was no more bread, wine or sugar to be found – nothing drinkable or eatable. There had been ladies standing at their front doors giving away glasses of wine and cups of broth until the last drops had gone from casks and saucepans. And now it was all gone, and by the time the first regiments of the 7th corps began to come through at about three the people were in despair. What, was it starting all over again? And still going on and on? Once again the main street was thronged with men, dead beat, covered with dust, dying of hunger, and they hadn’t a mouthful of anything to offer them. Many of the men stopped and knocked at doors, held out their hands in front of windows, begging for a crust of bread to be thrown to them. There were women in tears as they made signs that they couldn’t, that they had nothing left.","The little town is rich, with its numerous factories, its handsome thoroughfare lined with two rows of well-built houses, and its pretty church and mairie; but the night before Marshal MacMahon and the Emperor had passed that way with their respective staffs and all the imperial household, and during the whole of the present morning the entire 1st corps had been streaming like a torrent through the main street. The resources of the place had not been adequate to meet the requirements of these hosts; the shelves of the bakers and grocers were empty, and even the houses of the bourgeois had been swept clean of provisions; there was no bread, no wine, no sugar, nothing capable of allaying hunger or thirst. Ladies had been seen to station themselves before their doors and deal out glasses of wine and cups of bouillon until cask and kettle alike were drained of their last drop. And so there was an end, and when, about three o'clock, the first regiments of the 7th corps began to appear the scene was a pitiful one; the broad street was filled from curb to curb with weary, dust-stained men, dying with hunger, and there was not a mouthful of food to give them. Many of them stopped, knocking at doors and extending their hands beseechingly toward windows, begging for a morsel of bread, and women were seen to cry and sob as they motioned that they could not help them, that they had nothing left."

"Le jeune homme en convint, et il leur donnait raison, connaissant le pays, lui aussi, tourmenté d’une mortelle inquiétude, à l’idée de savoir les Prussiens dans les bois de Dieulet, en branle vers Sommauthe et Beaumont. Il s’était assis, harassé déjà, avant d’avoir marché, l’estomac vide, le cœur serré d’angoisse, à l’aube de cette journée qu’il sentait devoir être affreuse.","The young man agreed, and he gave them reason, knowing the country too, tormented with a mortal anxiety, at the idea of knowing the Prussians in the woods of Dieulet, moving towards Sommauthe and Beaumont. He had sat down, exhausted already, before he had walked, his stomach empty, his heart tight with anguish, at the dawn of this day which he felt must be dreadful.","Maurice agreed, and he knew the men were right, for he too knew the district, and he was just as much a prey to deadly anxiety at the thought that the Prussians were in the Dieulet woods and on the move towards Sommauthe and Beaumont. He was sitting down now, already feeling wretched before the march had even begun, his stomach empty and his heart sick with anguish at the dawn of a day he felt was bound to be terrible.","The young man agreed with him and commended their action, knowing as he did the country, and deeply alarmed to hear that the Prussians were in Dieulet forest and moving on Sommanthe and Beaumont. He had flung himself down by the roadside, exhausted before the march had commenced, with a sorrowing heart and an empty stomach, at the dawning of that day which he felt was to be so disastrous for them all."
"– Ne vous pressez pas, retournez-vous et lâchez votre coup… Nous nous rallierons là-bas, derrière ce petit mur.","– Do not hurry, turn around and let go… We will rally there, behind this small wall.","‘Don’t rush, turn round and fire as you go. We’ll find each other down there by that low wall.’","“Be cool, don't hurry; face about and give 'em another shot. Rally behind that low wall that you see down there.”"
"– Oui, c’est moi. J’en ai assez de me battre pour rien, et j’ai filé… Dites donc, père Fouchard, vous n’avez pas besoin d’un garçon de ferme ?","- Yes it's me. I've had enough of fighting for nothing, and I've slipped away. Tell me, Père Fouchard, you don't need a farm boy?","‘Yes, it’s me. I’ve had enough of fighting for nothing, so I’ve sloped off… I say, Pa Fouchard, I suppose you don’t want a farm-hand?’","“Yes, it is I. I have had enough of fighting for nothing, and I cut my lucky. Say, Father Fouchard, you don't happen to be in need of a laborer on your farm, do you?”"
"– Dame ! répondit Pache interloqué, je n’y suis pas pour mon plaisir… Seulement, les gendarmes…","- Lady ! answered Pache taken aback, I am not here for my pleasure… Only, the gendarmes…","‘Well, er…’ said Pache, quite taken aback, ‘I’m not here for my enjoyment… Only there’s the police…’","“Dame!” Pache doubtfully replied, “it is not for any pleasure of mine that I am here—but the gendarmes—”"

He knows well enough that now, when he orders, there is nothing left for me but to obey.”"
"Vers deux heures, tout habillée, Henriette vint se jeter sur son lit, en négligeant même de fermer la fenêtre. La fatigue, l’anxiété l’écrasaient. Qu’avait-elle, à grelotter ainsi de fièvre, elle si calme d’habitude, marchant d’un pas si léger, qu’on ne l’entendait pas vivre ? Et elle sommeilla péniblement, engourdie, avec la sensation persistante du malheur qui pesait dans le ciel noir. Tout d’un coup, au fond de son mauvais sommeil, le canon recommença, des détonations sourdes, lointaines ; et il ne cessait plus, régulier, entêté. Frissonnante, elle se mit sur son séant. Où était-elle donc ? Elle ne reconnaissait plus, elle ne voyait plus la chambre, qu’une épaisse fumée semblait emplir. Puis, elle comprit : des brouillards, qui s’étaient levés du fleuve voisin, avaient dû envahir la pièce. Dehors, le canon redoublait. Elle sauta du lit, elle courut à la fenêtre, pour écouter.","Around two o'clock, fully dressed, Henriette threw herself on her bed, even neglecting to close the window. Fatigue and anxiety crushed him. What was the matter with her, shivering thus with fever, she was usually so calm, walking with such a light step that one could not hear her living? And she slumbered painfully, numb, with the lingering sense of unhappiness hanging in the black sky. Suddenly, in the depths of its bad sleep, the cannon began again, dull, distant detonations; and he never stopped, regular, stubborn. Shivering, she sat up. Where was she? She no longer recognized, she no longer saw the room, which seemed to be filled with thick smoke. Then she understood: fog, which had risen from the nearby river, must have invaded the room. Outside, the cannon redoubled. She jumped out of bed, she ran to the window, to listen.","At about two Henriette threw herself on the bed, fully clothed, not even bothering to shut the window. She was overcome with fatigue and anxiety. What was the matter with her, shivering like this as though she had a temperature, for she was usually so placid, so light on her feet that you hardly heard her busying herself about. She fell into a troubled doze, numbed with a persistent sensation of impending doom in the black sky. Suddenly she was dragged from the depths of her uneasy sleep by the gunfire starting again with dull, distant boomings, but this time it went on, regular and persistent. She sat up, shuddering. Where was she? She did not recognize or even see the room, which seemed to be filled with dense smoke. Then she understood – the fog rising from the river near by must have got into the room. Out there the gunfire was getting heavier. She jumped up and ran to the window to listen.","It was about two o'clock when Henriette, forgetting even to close her window, at last threw herself, fully dressed, upon her bed. Her anxiety and fatigue had stupefied her and benumbed her faculties. What could ail her, thus to shiver and burn alternately, she who was always so calm and self-reliant, moving with so light a step that those about her were unconscious of her existence? Finally she sank into a fitful, broken slumber that brought with it no repose, in which was present still that persistent sensation of impending evil that filled the dusky heavens. All at once, arousing her from her unrefreshing stupor, the firing commenced again, faint and muffled in the distance, not a single shot this time, but peal after peal following one another in quick succession. Trembling, she sat upright in bed. The firing continued. Where was she? The place seemed strange to her; she could not distinguish the objects in her chamber, which appeared to be filled with dense clouds of smoke. Then she remembered: the fog must have rolled in from the near-by river and entered the room through the window. Without, the distant firing was growing fiercer. She leaped from her bed and ran to the casement to listen."
"– Nom de Dieu ! nom de Dieu ! répéta Lapoulle dévorant, ne trouvant pas d’autre mot, dans le grognement de sa satisfaction, tandis que Pache disait tout bas un Pater et un Ave, pour être certain que le ciel, le lendemain, lui enverrait encore sa nourriture.","- For God Sake ! For God Sake ! repeated Lapoulle devouring, finding no other word, in the groan of his satisfaction, while Pache whispered a Pater and an Ave, to be certain that Heaven would send him his nourishment the next day.","‘Oh Christ, oh Christ!’ Lapoulle kept on saying as he chewed, finding no other word in his growl of satisfaction, while Pache said under his breath a Paternoster and an Ave to make sure that God would send him his daily bread again tomorrow.",“Name o' God! Name o' God!” grunted Lapoulle as he contentedly munched the dry bread; it was all he could find to say; while Pache repeated a Pater and an Ave under his breath to make sure that Heaven should not forget to send him his breakfast in the morning.

"– J’ai vu le métier brûler comme un fagot de bois sec… Le lit, les meubles ont flambé plus vite que des poignées de paille… Et il y avait même la pendule, oui ! la pendule que je n’ai pas eu le temps d’emporter dans mes bras.","– I saw the loom burn like a bundle of dry wood… The bed, the furniture caught fire faster than handfuls of straw… And there was even the clock, yes! the clock that I did not have time to carry in my arms.","‘I saw the loom burning like dry firewood. The bed and the furniture blazed up quicker than handfuls of straw… And even the clock, I didn’t have time to bring that away.’","“The loom, I saw it burn like seasoned kindling wood, and the bed, the chairs and tables, they blazed like so much straw.

"Sept heures sonnaient, lorsque le capitaine Beaudoin, débarbouillé, brossé, ayant sous l’uniforme une chemise du mari, parut dans la salle à manger aux boiseries grises, très haute de plafond. Madame Delaherche, la mère, était déjà là, toujours debout à l’aube, malgré ses soixante-dix-huit ans. Toute blanche, elle avait un nez qui s’était aminci et une bouche qui ne riait plus, dans une longue face maigre. Elle se leva, se montra d’une grande politesse, en invitant le capitaine à s’asseoir devant une des tasses de café au lait qui étaient servies.","Seven o'clock was striking when Captain Beaudoin, washed and brushed, wearing the husband's shirt under his uniform, appeared in the dining room with gray paneling and a very high ceiling. Madame Delaherche, the mother, was already there, still up at dawn, despite her seventy-eight years. All white, she had a nose that had grown thinner and a mouth that no longer laughed, in a long, thin face. She got up, showed great politeness, inviting the captain to sit down before one of the cups of cafe au lait that were being served.","It was striking seven when Captain Beaudoin, all washed and brushed up, wearing one of the husband’s shirts under his uniform, appeared in the grey-panelled dining-room with its lofty ceiling. Madame Delaherche senior was there already, for she always rose at dawn in spite of her seventy-eight years. She was quite white, and her nose had got even more pointed and her mouth never laughed now in her long, thin face. She rose to her feet and was exceedingly polite, inviting the captain to sit down in front of one of the cups of coffee and milk already poured out.","It was seven o'clock when Captain Beaudoin, having done what he could with the means at his disposal to improve his appearance, and comforted by the sensation of wearing under his uniform a clean shirt of his host's, made his appearance in the spacious, high-ceiled dining room with its somber wainscoting. The elder Madame Delaherche was already there, for she was always on foot at daybreak, notwithstanding she was seventy-eight years old. Her hair was snowy white; in her long, lean face was a nose almost preternaturally thin and sharp and a mouth that had long since forgotten how to laugh. She rose, and with stately politeness invited the captain to be seated before one of the cups of cafe au lait that stood on the table."
"Mais Maurice, sans quitter des yeux les quartiers qui brûlaient, là-bas, bégaya lentement, avec peine :","But Maurice, without taking his eyes off the burning quarters over there, stammered slowly, with difficulty:","But Maurice, still gazing at the areas burning out there, said haltingly and with difficulty:","But Maurice, without taking his eyes from the fires that were raging in the distance, feebly, and with an effort, murmured:"
"Raillait-il ? Voulait-il expliquer pourquoi il la gardait, cette fille qui l’avait fâché avec son fils, et malgré l’enfant du Prussien dont elle refusait de se séparer ? De nouveau, il eut son coup d’œil oblique, son rire muet.","Was he kidding? Did he want to explain why he was keeping her, this girl who had made him angry with her son, and in spite of the Prussian's child from whom she refused to part? Again he had his sidelong glance, his silent laugh.","Was he teasing? Or was he trying to explain why he was keeping on this girl who had come between him and his son, and that in spite of the Prussian’s child from whom she refused to be parted?

"Et, déjà, de lui-même, il l’avait jetée entre les bras du Bavarois, qui l’emportait.

Il avait ménagé la blessure, à peine quelques gouttes jaillirent-elles, sous la poussée du cœur. Si la mort en fut plus lente, on n’en vit même pas les convulsions, car les cordes étaient solides, l’immobilité du corps resta complète. Pas une secousse et pas un râle. On ne put suivre l’agonie que sur le visage, sur ce masque labouré par l’épouvante, d’où le sang se retirait goutte à goutte, la peau décolorée, d’une blancheur de linge. Et les yeux se vidaient, eux aussi. Ils se troublèrent et s’éteignirent.","They advanced it, and Sambuc proceeded quietly, neatly. With a single stroke of the large knife, he opened his throat, crosswise. Immediately, from the severed carotid, blood began to flow into the tub, with a little fountain noise. He had spared the wound, barely a few drops spurted out, under the pressure of the heart. If death was slower, we did not even see the convulsions, because the cords were solid, the immobility of the body remained complete. Not a jolt and not a rattle. The agony could only be traced on the face, on that mask plowed by terror, from which the blood was withdrawing drop by drop, the discolored skin, as white as linen. And the eyes were emptying, too. They became confused and died out.","They moved him over, and Sambuc proceeded calmly and neatly. With a single cut of the big knife he slit the throat across. The blood from the severed carotid poured out at once into the tub with a little noise like falling water. He had taken care with the cut and only a few drops pumped out with the heartbeats. Although this made death slower, there were no struggles visible, for the ropes were strong and the body remained quite motionless. Not a single jerk or gasp. The only way the march of death could be followed was on the face, a mask distorted by terror, from which the blood was receding drop by drop as the skin lost its colour and went white as a sheet. The eyes also emptied themselves. They dimmed and then went out.","They drew him forward, and Sambuc went about his task in a tranquil, decent manner. With a single stroke of the keen knife he slit the throat crosswise from ear to ear, and immediately the blood from the severed carotid artery commenced to drip, drip into the tub with the gentle plashing of a fountain. He had taken care not to make the incision too deep; only a few drops spurted from the wound, impelled by the action of the heart. Death was the slower in coming for that, but no convulsion was to be seen, for the cords were strong and the body was utterly incapable of motion. There was no death-rattle, not a quiver of the frame. On the face alone was evidence of the supreme agony, on that terror-distorted mask whence the blood retreated drop by drop, leaving the skin colorless, with a whiteness like that of linen. The expression faded from the eyes; they became dim, the light died from out them."
"– Lâches, le Rhin n’est pas là… Le Rhin est là-bas, lâches, lâches !","– Cowards, the Rhine is not there… The Rhine is over there, cowards, cowards!","‘Cowards, the Rhine isn’t that way… The Rhine is over there, cowards, cowards!’","“Cowards, the Rhine is not there! The Rhine lies yonder! Cowards, cowards!”"
"– Bonjour, père Fouchard.","“Hello, Father Fouchard.","‘Good morning, Monsieur Fouchard.’","“How are you, Father Fouchard?”"
"– Oh ! c’est bien ça, oui ! c’est bien ça qui me rend folle. Pourquoi ai-je consenti, puisque je ne vous aimais point ?… Je ne puis pas me souvenir, j’étais si triste, si malade du départ d’Honoré, et ç’a été peut-être parce que vous me parliez de lui et que vous aviez l’air de l’aimer… Mon Dieu ! que de nuits j’ai passées à pleurer toutes les larmes de mon corps, en songeant à ça ! C’est abominable d’avoir fait une chose qu’on ne voulait pas faire, sans pouvoir s’expliquer ensuite pourquoi on l’a faite… Et il m’avait pardonné, il m’avait dit que, si ces cochons de Prussiens ne le tuaient pas, il m’épouserait tout de même, quand il rentrerait du service… Et vous croyez que je vais retourner avec vous ? Ah ! tenez ! sous le couteau, je dirai non, non, jamais !","- Oh ! that's right, yes! that's what drives me crazy. Why did I consent, since I didn't love you?... I can't remember, I was so sad, so ill at Honoré's departure, and it was perhaps because you were talking to me about him. and that you seemed to love her… My God! How many nights have I spent crying all the tears in my body, thinking of that! It's abominable to have done something you didn't want to do, without being able to explain why you did it... And he forgave me, he told me that if those Prussian pigs didn't kill him, he'd marry me all the same, when he got back from service… And you think I'm going back with you? Ah! hold ! under the knife, I will say no, no, never!","‘Oh, yes, I know, yes, it’s just that that’s driving me crazy. Why did I let you when I didn’t love you? … I can’t remember, I was so miserable and so ill after Honoré had gone, and it may have been perhaps because you talked about him and seemed to be fond of him. Oh God, how many nights have I spent crying my eyes out thinking about it! It’s horrible to have done something you didn’t mean to do and not to be able to understand afterwards why you did it … And he had forgiven me, he had told me that if those Prussian swine didn’t kill him he would marry me just the same when he came back home from the army. And you think I’m going back with you? Now look, even with a knife at my throat I shall say no, no, never!’","“Oh! that is just it; yes, it is that which seems as if it would drive me wild. Why, oh! why did I yield when I never loved you? Honore's departure left me so broken down, I was so sick in mind and body that never have I been able to recall any portion of the circumstances; perhaps it was because you talked to me of him and appeared to love him. My God! the long nights I have spent thinking of that time and weeping until the fountain of my tears was dry! It is dreadful to have done a thing that one had no wish to do and afterward be unable to explain the reason of it. And he had forgiven me, he had told me that he would marry me in spite of all when his time was out, if those hateful Prussians only let him live. And you think I will return to you. No, never, never! not if I were to die for it!”"
"Et son geste embrassait l’immense vallée, pleine d’ombre. Le ciel n’était pas si obscur, qu’on ne pût distinguer, dans le déroulement des prés noirs, le cours pâle du fleuve. Les bouquets d’arbres faisaient des masses plus lourdes, une rangée de peupliers surtout, à gauche, qui barrait l’horizon d’une digue fantastique. Puis, dans les fonds, derrière Sedan, piqueté de petites clartés vives, c’était un entassement de ténèbres, comme si toutes les forêts des Ardennes eussent jeté là le rideau de leurs chênes centenaires.","And his gesture embraced the immense valley, full of shadow. The sky was not so dark that one could not distinguish, in the unrolling of the black meadows, the pale course of the river. The clumps of trees made heavier masses, a row of poplars especially, on the left, which barred the horizon with a fantastic dyke. Then, in the depths, behind Sedan, speckled with small bright lights, there was a heap of darkness, as if all the forests of the Ardennes had thrown there the curtain of their hundred-year-old oaks.","His gesture took in the immense valley, full of darkness. The sky was not so black that you could not make out the pale course of the river across the panorama of black fields. Clumps of trees made darker patches, especially a row of poplars to the left, which cut off the horizon like a fantastic dike. Then in the background behind Sedan, with its sprinkling of bright little lights, was a heap of blackness as if all the forests of the Ardennes had drawn across their curtain of age-old oaks.","And his sweeping gesture embraced the entire valley that lay beneath them, enfolded in shadow. There was sufficient light remaining in the sky that they could distinguish the pale gleam of the river where it ran its course among the dusky meadows. The scattered trees made clumps of denser shade, especially a row of poplars to the left, whose tops were profiled on the horizon like the fantastic ornaments on some old castle gateway. And in the background, behind Sedan, dotted with countless little points of brilliant light, the shadows had mustered, denser and darker, as if all the forests of the Ardennes had collected the inky blackness of their secular oaks and cast it there."
"– Retiens bien ce que je vais te dire, Silvine… Je sais tout ce qui se passe ici. Vous recevez les francs-tireurs des bois de Dieulet, ce Sambuc qui est le frère de votre garçon de ferme, un bandit que vous fournissez de pain. Et je sais que ce garçon, ce Prosper, est un chasseur d’Afrique, un déserteur, qui nous appartient ; et je sais encore que vous cachez un blessé, un autre soldat qu’un mot de moi ferait conduire en Allemagne, dans une forteresse… Hein ? tu le vois, je suis bien renseigné…","– Remember what I'm going to tell you, Silvine… I know everything that's going on here. You receive the francs-tireurs from the woods of Dieulet, this Sambuc who is the brother of your farm boy, a bandit whom you supply with bread. And I know that this boy, this Prosper, is a hunter from Africa, a deserter, who belongs to us; and I also know that you are hiding a wounded man, another soldier whom a word from me would lead to Germany, to a fortress... Eh? you see, I am well informed...","‘Just bear in mind what I’m going to say, Silvine… I know everything that’s going on here. You harbour the guerrillas from the Dieulet woods, that chap Sambuc, the brother of your farm-hand, a bandit you’re supplying with bread. And I know that this labourer Prosper is a Chasseur d’Afrique and a deserter who belongs to us. And I know too that you are hiding a wounded man, another soldier who would be taken off to prison in Germany at a word from me… So you see, I’m well informed.’","“Bear in mind what I am about to tell you, Silvine. I know all that happens at this farm. You harbor the francs-tireurs from the wood of Dieulet, among them that Sambuc who is brother to your hired man; you supply the bandits with provisions. And I know that that hired man, Prosper, is a chasseur d'Afrique and a deserter, and belongs to us by rights. Further, I know that you are concealing on your premises a wounded man, another soldier, whom a word from me would suffice to consign to a German fortress. What do you think: am I not well informed?”"
"Il poussait son cheval, barrait le chemin aux fuyards, trouvait des paroles pour chacun, parlait de la France, d’une voix où tremblaient des larmes.","He pushed his horse, barred the way to fugitives, found words for everyone, spoke of France in a voice trembling with tears.","He urged on his horse and blocked the way against those who were turning tail, finding some word for each one, talking of France in a voice breaking with emotion.","And he spurred his charger across the path of the fugitives, addressing them individually, speaking to them, of their country, in a voice that trembled with emotion."
"Sur la terrasse, vivement, Delaherche tâcha de se rendre compte de la situation. La ville avait moins souffert qu’on ne croyait, un seul incendie jetait une grosse fumée noire, dans le faubourg de la Cassine. Le fort du Palatinat ne tirait plus, faute sans doute de munitions. Seules, les pièces de la porte de Paris lâchaient encore un coup, de loin en loin. Et, tout de suite, ce qui l’intéressa, ce fut de constater qu’on avait de nouveau hissé un drapeau blanc sur le donjon ; mais on ne devait pas l’apercevoir du champ de bataille, car le feu continuait, aussi intense. Des toitures voisines lui cachaient la route de Balan, il ne put y suivre le mouvement des troupes. D’ailleurs, ayant mis son œil à la lunette qui était restée braquée, il venait de retomber sur l’état-major allemand, qu’il avait déjà vu à cette place, dès midi. Le maître, le minuscule soldat de plomb, haut comme la moitié du petit doigt, dans lequel il croyait avoir reconnu le roi de Prusse, se trouvait toujours debout, avec son uniforme sombre, en avant des autres officiers, la plupart couchés sur l’herbe, étincelants de broderies. Il y avait là des officiers étrangers, des aides de camp, des généraux, des maréchaux de cour, des princes, tous pourvus de lorgnettes, suivant depuis le matin l’agonie de l’armée française, comme au spectacle. Et le drame formidable s’achevait.","On the terrace, Delaherche quickly tried to take stock of the situation. The town had suffered less than was thought; a single fire threw up great black smoke in the Faubourg de la Cassine. The Palatinate fort was no longer firing, no doubt for lack of ammunition. Only the guns of the Porte de Paris still let loose a blow, from time to time. And, immediately, what interested him was to see that a white flag had once again been hoisted over the keep; but it was not to be seen from the field of battle, for the fire continued, just as intense. Nearby roofs hid the road to Balan from him, he could not follow the movement of the troops there. Moreover, having put his eye to the telescope which had remained pointed, he had just fallen upon the German general staff, which he had already seen in this place, at noon. The master, the tiny tin soldier, as high as half a finger, in which he believed he had recognized the King of Prussia, was still standing, in his dark uniform, in front of the other officers, most of them lying on the grass, sparkling embroidery. There were foreign officers there, aides-de-camp, generals, court-marshals, princes, all provided with telescopes, following the agony of the French army since the morning, as if at a spectacle. And the formidable drama was over.","Up on his flat roof Delaherche tried to get a quick impression of the situation. The town had been less damaged than had been feared and only one fire was sending up thick black smoke in the Cassine district. The Palatinate fort had stopped firing, having probably run out of ammunition. Only the guns at the Paris gate were still firing an odd round now and again. What interested him immediately was that they had once again run up the white flag over the Keep, but they couldn’t be seeing it from the battlefield, for the firing was still as heavy as ever. Some roofs in the foreground concealed the Balan road and he could not follow the movements of troops there. Moreover, having put his eye to the telescope which was still trained in that direction, he once again had picked out the German Headquarters which he had already seen there at noon. The master, that diminutive tin soldier, as big as half your little finger, in whom he thought he had recognized the King of Prussia, was still standing there in his dark uniform, in front of the other officers, most of whom were lying on the grass and all shining with gold braid. There were foreign officers there, aides-de-camp, generals, court officials, princes, all provided with field glasses, and since early morning they had been following the death-struggles of the French army like a play. And now the terrible drama was drawing to its close.","Rapidly climbing the stairs to his terrace, Delaherche endeavored to form some idea for himself of how matters stood. The city had suffered less injury than was generally supposed; there was one great conflagration, however, over in the Faubourg de la Cassine, from which dense volumes of smoke were rising. Fort Palatinat had discontinued its fire, doubtless because the ammunition was all expended; the guns mounted on the Porte de Paris alone continued to make themselves heard at infrequent intervals. But something that he beheld presently had greater interest for his eyes than all beside; they had run up the white flag on the citadel again, but it must be that it was invisible from the battlefield, for there was no perceptible slackening of the fire. The Balan road was concealed from his vision by the neighboring roofs; he was unable to make out what the troops were doing in that direction. Applying his eye to the telescope, however, which remained as he had left it, directed on la Marfee, he again beheld the cluster of officers that he had seen in that same place about midday. The master of them all, that miniature toy-soldier in lead, half finger high, in whom he had thought to recognize the King of Prussia, was there still, erect in his plain, dark uniform before the other officers, who, in their showy trappings, were for the most part reclining carelessly on the grass. Among them were officers from foreign lands, aides-de-camp, generals, high officials, princes; all of them with field glasses in their hands, with which, since early morning, they had been watching every phase of the death-struggle of the army of Chalons, as if they were at the play. And the direful drama was drawing to its end."
"Les préparatifs avaient traîné, il était près de sept heures, lorsque Silvine et Prosper, derrière l’étroite charrette que le petit âne gris tirait, la tête basse, descendirent les pentes raides de Remilly. Il avait plu abondamment pendant la nuit, les chemins se trouvaient changés en fleuves de boue ; et de grandes nuées livides couraient dans le ciel, d’une tristesse morne.","The preparations had dragged on, it was nearly seven o'clock, when Silvine and Prosper, behind the narrow cart which the little gray donkey was pulling, head bowed, descended the steep slopes of Remilly. It had rained heavily during the night, the roads had changed into rivers of mud; and great livid clouds ran across the sky in a gloomy sadness.","Preparations had taken a long time, and it was nearly seven when Silvine and Prosper, walking behind the little trap drawn by the grey donkey with its head down, descended the steep slopes of Remilly. It had rained heavily during the night, and the roads had turned into rivers of mud, and great angry clouds were racing across the dreary, depressing sky.","They were late in getting off; it was near seven o'clock when the little procession, the donkey, hanging his head and drawing the narrow cart, leading, descended the steep hill of Remilly. It had rained heavily during the night, and the roads were become rivers of mud; great lowering clouds hung in the heavens, imparting an air of cheerless desolation to the scene."
"Au bord du chemin, se trouvait une maison isolée, la demeure de quelque paysan pauvre, dont le maigre bien s’étendait derrière. Celui-là n’avait pas voulu quitter son champ, attaché au sol par des racines trop profondes ; et il restait, ne pouvant s’éloigner, sans laisser là des lambeaux de sa chair. On l’apercevait dans une salle basse, écrasé sur un banc, regardant d’un œil vide défiler ces soldats, dont la retraite allait livrer son blé mûr à l’ennemi. Debout à son côté, sa femme, jeune encore, tenait un enfant, tandis qu’un autre se pendait à ses jupes ; et tous les trois se lamentaient. Mais, tout d’un coup, dans le cadre de la porte violemment ouverte, parut la grand’mère, une très vieille femme, haute, maigre, avec des bras nus, pareils à des cordes noueuses, qu’elle agitait furieusement. Ses cheveux gris, échappés de son bonnet, s’envolaient autour de sa tête décharnée, et sa rage était si grande, que les paroles qu’elle criait, s’étranglaient dans sa gorge, indistinctes.","By the side of the road was a lonely house, the dwelling of some poor peasant, whose meager property lay behind. This one had not wanted to leave his field, attached to the ground by too deep roots; and he remained, unable to depart, without leaving there shreds of his flesh. He could be seen in a low room, crushed on a bench, watching with empty eyes these soldiers march past, whose retreat was about to deliver its ripe corn to the enemy. Standing by his side, his wife, still young, held a child, while another clung to her skirts; and all three were lamenting. But suddenly, within the framework of the violently opened door, appeared the grandmother, a very old woman, tall, thin, with bare arms, like knotted ropes, which she waved furiously. Her gray hair, which escaped from her bonnet, flew around her emaciated head, and her rage was so great that the words she cried choked in her throat, indistinct.","By the roadside there was an isolated house, the dwelling of some poor peasant, the whole of whose little property lay stretched out behind it. He had refused to leave his field, where his roots were too deeply sunk in the soil, and there he was, unable to go unless he left some of his very flesh there. He could be seen in a low-ceilinged room, slumped on a seat, staring with unseeing eyes at these passing soldiers, whose retreat would hand his ripe corn over to the enemy. Standing by him his wife, still quite young, was holding a child while another was clinging to her skirt, and all three were wailing. Then suddenly the front door was flung open and the grandmother appeared, a very old woman, tall and skinny, with bare arms like knotted ropes, furiously waving. Wisps of grey hair came out from under her bonnet and blew round her wizened face, and she was in such a rage that the words she was yelling stuck in her throat and could hardly be heard.","Standing by the road-side was a lonely house, the abode of some poor peasant, whose lean acres extended up the mountainside in the rear. The man had been unwilling to leave the little field that was his all and had remained, for to go away would have been to him like parting with life. He could be seen within the low-ceiled room, sitting stupidly on a bench, watching with dull, lack-luster eyes the passing of the troops whose retreat would give his ripe grain over to be the spoil of the enemy. Standing beside him was his wife, still a young woman, holding in her arms a child, while another was hanging by her skirts; all three were weeping bitterly. Suddenly the door was thrown open with violence and in its enframement appeared the grandmother, a very old woman, tall and lean of form, with bare, sinewy arms like knotted cords that she raised above her head and shook with frantic gestures. Her gray, scanty locks had escaped from her cap and were floating about her skinny face, and such was her fury that the words she shouted choked her utterance and came from her lips almost unintelligible."
"– Allons, toi aussi !","- Come on, you too!","‘All right, you too.’","“Well, thou too!”"
"– Ah ! ma sœur est ici ! répétait Maurice. C’est donc ça que Monsieur Delaherche voulait me dire, avec son grand geste que je ne comprenais pas !… Eh bien ! si elle est ici, ça va tout seul, nous restons.","– Ah! my sister is here! repeated Maurice. So that's what Monsieur Delaherche wanted to say to me, with his big gesture that I didn't understand!... Well! if she's here, it's fine, we stay.","‘Oh, so my sister’s here! So that’s what Monsieur Delaherche meant by the big gesture I couldn’t understand! Oh well, if she’s here it goes without saying, we stay!’","“Ah! so my sister is here,” said Maurice. “That must have been what M. Delaherche wished to tell me, with his gestures that I could not understand. Very well; if she is here, that settles it; we shall remain.”"
"Et ce fut tout, elle descendit de la passerelle, sans dire même un adieu, fuyant avec sa petite valise ; tandis que lui resta longtemps encore là-haut, immobile et mince, sanglé dans son uniforme, noyé de nuit, s’emplissant les yeux de la monstrueuse fête que lui donnait le spectacle de la Babylone en flammes.","And that was all, she descended from the bridge, without even saying a goodbye, fleeing with her little suitcase; while he remained up there for a long time yet, motionless and thin, strapped in his uniform, drowned in the night, filling his eyes with the monstrous feast given him by the spectacle of Babylon in flames.","That was all, and she walked down from the footbridge without even saying good-bye, and ran off, holding her little case. But he stayed up there a long time, slender and motionless, tightly buttoned in his uniform, lost in the night and letting his eyes drink their fill of this monstrous spectacle of Babylon in flames.","And that was all; she left the bridge, without even bidding him good-by, flying, she knew not whither, with her little satchel, while he remained yet a long time at his post of observation, a motionless figure, rigid and erect, lost in the darkness of the night, feasting his eyes on the spectacle of that Babylon in flames."
"Le matin, Delaherche, en apprenant que l’armée allait passer à Mouzon, avait fait avec Weiss, son comptable, cette promenade en cabriolet, dont le père Fouchard avait parlé à Maurice. Gros et grand, le teint coloré, le nez fort et les lèvres épaisses, il était de tempérament expansif, il avait la curiosité gaie du bourgeois français qui aime les beaux défilés de troupes. Ayant su par le pharmacien de Mouzon que l’empereur se trouvait à la ferme de Baybel, il y était monté, l’avait vu, avait même failli causer avec lui, toute une histoire énorme, dont il ne tarissait pas depuis son retour. Mais quel terrible retour, à travers la panique de Beaumont, par les chemins encombrés de fuyards ! Vingt fois, le cabriolet avait failli culbuter dans les fossés. Les deux hommes n’étaient rentrés qu’à la nuit, au milieu d’obstacles sans cesse renaissants. Et cette partie de plaisir, cette armée que Delaherche était allé voir défiler, à deux lieues, et qui le ramenait violemment dans le galop de sa retraite, toute cette aventure imprévue et tragique lui avait fait répéter, à dix reprises, le long de la route :","In the morning, Delaherche, on learning that the army was going to pass through Mouzon, had taken that ride in a cabriolet with Weiss, his accountant, of which Father Fouchard had spoken to Maurice. Big and tall, with a colorful complexion, a strong nose and thick lips, he was of an expansive temperament, he had the gay curiosity of the French bourgeois who loves beautiful parades of troops. Having learned from the pharmacist of Mouzon that the Emperor was at Baybel's farm, he had gone up there, had seen him, had even come close to chatting with him, a whole enormous story, which he had not dried up since his return. But what a terrible return, through the panic of Beaumont, along the paths encumbered with fugitives! Twenty times the cabriolet had almost tumbled into the ditches. The two men had not returned until nightfall, amid ever-recurring obstacles. And this pleasure party, this army that Delaherche had gone to see march past, two leagues away, and which was bringing him back violently in the gallop of his retreat, all this unforeseen and tragic adventure had made him repeat, ten times, along the road :","The day before, in the morning, Delaherche, learning that the army was to pass through Mouzon, had been out with Weiss, his book-keeper, for the drive that old Fouchard had mentioned to Maurice. Tall and heavily built, with a high colour, strong nose and thick lips, he was an outgoing kind of man with the middle-class Frenchman’s enjoyment and interest in watching fine parades of troops. Having been told by the chemist at Mouzon that the Emperor was at Baybel farmhouse, he had gone up as far as there, had seen him, and even almost spoken to him – quite a thrilling adventure that he had never stopped narrating since his return. But what a terrible return it was, through the panic at Beaumont and on the roads blocked with fugitives! A score of times the carriage had nearly capsized in ditches, and it was dark before the two men had made their way back through ever recurring obstacles. This pleasure jaunt, the army that Delaherche had travelled two leagues to see go by and which carried him brutally back in the stampede of its retreat, this whole unforeseen and tragic tale had made him say ten times over on the way back:","That morning Delaherche, when he learned that the army was to pass through Mouzon, had invited Weiss, his accountant, to accompany him on that carriage ride of which we have heard Father Fouchard speak to Maurice. Tall and stout, with a florid complexion, prominent nose and thick lips, he was of a cheerful, sanguine temperament and had all the French bourgeois' boyish love for a handsome display of troops. Having ascertained from the apothecary at Mouzon that the Emperor was at Baybel, a farm in the vicinity, he had driven up there; had seen the monarch, and even had been near speaking to him, an adventure of such thrilling interest that he had talked of it incessantly ever since his return. But what a terrible return that had been, over roads choked with the panic-stricken fugitives from Beaumont! twenty times their cabriolet was near being overturned into the ditch. Obstacle after obstacle they had encountered, and it was night before the two men reached home. The element of the tragic and unforeseen there was in the whole business, that army that Delaherche had driven out to pass in review and which had brought him home with it, whether he would or no, in the mad gallop of its retreat, made him repeat again and again during their long drive:"
Mais Maurice se désespérait.,But Maurice was in despair.,But Maurice was in desperation.,Maurice was in despair; he knew not what to do.
"– Ah ! ouiche ! c’est nous autres qui claquons de misère, et à qui on donnerait un sou, quand nous passons avec nos godillots crevés et nos frusques de chienlits… Et leurs grandes victoires donc ! Encore de jolis farceurs, lorsqu’ils nous racontaient qu’on venait de faire Bismarck prisonnier et qu’on avait culbuté toute une armée dans une carrière… Non, ce qu’ils se sont foutus de nous !","– Ah! yes! it's us who are dying of misery, and to whom we would give a penny, when we pass by with our punctured boots and our shabby togs... And their great victories then! More pretty pranksters, when they told us that we had just taken Bismarck prisoner and that we had knocked an entire army into a quarry... No, they didn't care about us!","He was a real Parisian smart aleck, who had dabbled in all the dubious jobs at the Markets. ‘Don’t you believe it, we’re the ones pegging out in poverty, the ones people’d give a penny to when we go by with our cracked boots and scarecrow’s clothes. And what about those famous victories? And that was a nice joke too, when they told us how Bismarck had been taken prisoner and that they had kicked a whole army of them into a quarry… Balls! They were fucking well having us on!’","“Oh, that's all in my eye! it is we fellows who have been catching it right along; we are the poor devils whose leaky brogans and tattered toggery would make folks throw us a copper. And then those great victories about which they made such a fuss! What precious liars they must be, to tell us that old Bismarck had been made prisoner and that a German army had been driven over a quarry and dashed to pieces! Oh yes, they fooled us in great shape.”"
– Mais pourquoi restez-vous ?,"""But why are you staying?""","‘Why stay, then?’",“But why do you stay here?”
"Ainsi que Maurice l’avait prévu, les milliers de chevaux emprisonnés avec l’armée, et qu’on ne pouvait nourrir, étaient un danger qui croissait de jour en jour. D’abord, ils avaient mangé l’écorce des arbres, ensuite ils s’étaient attaqués aux treillages, aux palissades, à toutes les planches qu’ils rencontraient, et maintenant ils se dévoraient entre eux. On les voyait se jeter les uns sur les autres, pour s’arracher les crins de la queue, qu’ils mâchaient furieusement, au milieu d’un flot d’écume. Mais, la nuit surtout, ils devenaient terribles, comme si l’obscurité les eût hantés de cauchemars. Ils se réunissaient, se ruaient sur les rares tentes debout, attirés par la paille. Vainement, les hommes, pour les écarter, avaient allumé de grands feux, qui semblaient les exciter davantage. Leurs hennissements étaient si lamentables, si effrayants, qu’on aurait dit des rugissements de bêtes fauves. On les chassait, ils revenaient plus nombreux et plus féroces. Et, à chaque instant, dans les ténèbres, on entendait le long cri d’agonie de quelque soldat perdu, que l’enragé galop venait d’écraser.","As Maurice had foreseen, the thousands of horses imprisoned with the army, and which could not be fed, were a danger which increased day by day. First they had eaten the bark of the trees, then they had attacked the trellises, the palisades, all the planks they found, and now they were devouring each other. They could be seen throwing themselves on each other, to tear the hairs from their tails, which they chewed furiously, in the midst of a flood of foam. But, especially at night, they became terrible, as if the darkness had haunted them with nightmares. They gathered together, rushing to the few standing tents, attracted by the straw. In vain, the men, to ward them off, had lit great fires, which seemed to excite them the more. Their whinnies were so lamentable, so terrifying, that they sounded like the roars of wild beasts. They were chased away, they came back more numerous and more ferocious. And, every moment, in the darkness, one heard the long cry of agony of some lost soldier, whom the enraged gallop had just crushed.","As Maurice had foreseen, the thousands of horses interned with the army and which could not be fed were a menace that increased in seriousness each day. They had begun by eating the bark of trees, then they had attacked trellises and fences, any sort of planks they could find, and now they were devouring each other. They could be seen hurling themselves on each other to tear the hair from their tails, which they chewed madly, foaming at the mouth. But it was above all at night that they became terrible, as though darkness brought them nightmares. They would gather together and charge at the few tents standing, looking for straw. It was useless for the men to light big fires to keep them off; the fires seemed to excite them still more. Their whinnyings were so pitiful and unnerving that they seemed like the roaring of wild beasts. If you drove them away they came back fiercer and more numerous than ever. And every minute during the hours of darkness you could hear a long cry of agony from some stray soldier trampled to death in this mad stampede.","As Maurice had foreseen, the thousands of horses that shared the captivity of the army, and for which it was impossible to provide forage, constituted a peril that grew greater day by day. At first they had nibbled the vegetation and gnawed the bark off trees, then had attacked the fences and whatever wooden structures they came across, and now they seemed ready to devour one another. It was a frequent occurrence to see one of them throw himself upon another and tear out great tufts from his mane or tail, which he would grind between his teeth, slavering meanwhile at the mouth profusely. But it was at night that they became most terrible, as if they were visited by visions of terror in the darkness. They collected in droves, and, attracted by the straw, made furious rushes upon what few tents there were, overturning and demolishing them. It was to no purpose that the men built great fires to keep them away; the device only served to madden them the more. Their shrill cries were so full of anguish, so dreadful to the ear, that they might have been mistaken for the howls of wild beasts. Were they driven away, they returned, more numerous and fiercer than before. Scarce a moment passed but out in the darkness could be heard the shriek of anguish of some unfortunate soldier whom the crazed beasts had crushed in their wild stampede."
"Et, avec une adresse extraordinaire, sans se reprendre, il trancha les muscles d’une seule entaille, jusqu’aux os. Il dénuda le tibia et le péroné, introduisit entre eux la compresse à trois chefs, pour les maintenir. Puis, d’un trait de scie unique, il les abattit. Et le pied resta aux mains de l’infirmier qui le tenait.","And, with extraordinary dexterity, without stopping himself, he sliced through the muscles with a single cut, down to the bone. He stripped the tibia and the fibula, introduced between them the compress with three heads, to maintain them. Then, with a single kerf, he knocked them down. And the foot remained in the hands of the nurse who held it.","With wonderful skill, and without any hesitation, he cut the muscles with a single stroke right down to the bones, laying bare the tibia and fibula between which he put a three-tailed compress to keep them in position. Then he cut them through with one stroke of the saw. The foot remained in the hands of the orderly who was holding it.","And with wonderful dexterity, never changing his position, he cut through the muscles clean down to the bone with a single motion of his wrist. He laid bare the tibia and fibula, introduced between them an implement to keep them in position, drew the saw across them once, and they were sundered. And the foot remained in the hands of the attendant who was holding it."
"Mais, quand le calme fut un peu revenu, Fouchard fut très ennuyé d’entendre que Silvine parlait toujours d’aller chercher le corps d’Honoré, là-bas. Elle s’obstinait, sans cris maintenant, dans un silence désespéré et invincible ; et il ne la reconnaissait plus, elle si docile, faisant toutes les besognes en fille résignée : ses grands yeux de soumission qui suffisaient à la beauté de son visage avaient pris une décision farouche, tandis que son front restait pâle, sous le flot de ses épais cheveux bruns. Elle venait d’arracher un fichu rouge qu’elle avait aux épaules, elle s’était mise toute en noir, comme une veuve. Vainement, il lui représenta la difficulté des recherches, les dangers qu’elle pouvait courir, le peu d’espoir qu’il y avait de retrouver le corps. Elle cessait même de répondre, il voyait bien qu’elle partirait seule, qu’elle ferait quelque folie, s’il ne s’en occupait pas, ce qui l’inquiétait plus encore, à cause des complications où cela pouvait le jeter avec les autorités prussiennes. Aussi finit-il par se décider à se rendre chez le maire de Remilly, qui était un peu son cousin, et à eux deux ils arrangèrent une histoire : Silvine fut donnée pour la veuve véritable d’Honoré, Prosper devint son frère ; de sorte que le colonel bavarois, installé en bas du village, à l’hôtel de la Croix de Malte, voulut bien délivrer un laissez-passer pour le frère et la sœur, les autorisant à ramener le corps du mari, s’ils le découvraient. La nuit était venue, tout ce qu’on put obtenir de la jeune femme, ce fut qu’elle attendrait le jour pour se mettre en marche.","But, when calm had returned a little, Fouchard was very annoyed to hear that Silvine was still talking about going to get Honoré's body over there. She persisted, without shouting now, in a desperate and invincible silence; and he no longer recognized her, her so docile, doing all the chores like a resigned girl: her large eyes of submission, which sufficed for the beauty of her face, had made a fierce decision, while her forehead remained pale under the flood of her thick brown hair. She had just torn off a red kerchief from her shoulders, she had put on all black, like a widow. In vain he represented to her the difficulty of the search, the dangers she might run, the little hope there was of finding the body. She even stopped answering, he could clearly see that she would leave alone, that she would do something crazy, if he didn't take care of it, which worried him even more, because of the complications into which it could throw him. the Prussian authorities. So he ended up deciding to go to the mayor of Remilly, who was something of a cousin to him, and between them they arranged a story: Silvine was given for the real widow of Honoré, Prosper became his brother; so that the Bavarian colonel, installed at the bottom of the village, at the Hotel de la Croix de Malte, was kind enough to issue a pass for the brother and sister, authorizing them to bring back the body of the husband, if they wanted to. were discovering. Night had come, all that could be obtained from the young woman was that she would wait for daylight to set off.","But when some sort of calm was restored Fouchard was very put out to hear Silvine still talking about going to find Honoré’s body out there. She was quite set now in a desperate, unshakable silence, with no more lamenting, and he hardly recognized her, normally so docile, doing everything with resignation, for her big submissive eyes that alone gave her such beauty had taken on a fierce decision in her pale face under the thick, dark hair. She had snatched off a red scarf from round her shoulders and was all in black like a widow. He pointed out the difficulties of the search, the risks she might run, how little hope there was of finding the body, but all in vain. She gave up even anwering him, and he realized that she would go off on her own and do something silly unless he did something about it, and that worried him still more because of the possible complications he might run into with the Prussian authorities. So in the end he decided to go and see the Mayor of Remilly, who was a distant cousin of his, and between them they made up a tale: Silvine was given out to be the real widow of Honoré and Prosper became her brother, and on the strength of that the Bavarian colonel, billeted at the lower end of the village in the Hôtel de la Croix de Malte, agreed to issue a pass for the brother and sister authorizing them to bring back the husband ’s body if they could find it. By now it was dark, and the utmost they could get out of Silvine was that she would wait until daylight before setting out.","When their agitation had in a measure subsided, however, Fouchard was annoyed that Silvine still continued to talk of going to search for Honore's body out there on the battlefield. She made no further noisy demonstration, but harbored her purpose with the dogged silence of despair, and he failed to recognize in her the docile, obedient servant who was wont to perform her daily tasks without a murmur; her great, submissive eyes, in which lay the chief beauty of her face, had assumed an expression of stern determination, while beneath her thick brown hair her cheeks and brow wore a pallor that was like death. She had torn off the red kerchief that was knotted about her neck, and was entirely in black, like a widow in her weeds. It was all in vain that he tried to impress on her the difficulties of the undertaking, the dangers she would be subjected to, the little hope there was of recovering the corpse; she did not even take the trouble to answer him, and he saw clearly that unless he seconded her in her plan she would start out alone and do some unwise thing, and this aspect of the case worried him on account of the complications that might arise between him and the Prussian authorities. He therefore finally decided to go and lay the matter before the mayor of Remilly, who was a kind of distant cousin of his, and they two between them concocted a story: Silvine was to pass as the actual widow of Honore, Prosper became her brother, so that the Bavarian colonel, who had his quarters in the Hotel of the Maltese Cross down in the lower part of the village, made no difficulty about granting a pass which authorized the brother and sister to bring home the body of the husband, provided they could find it. By this time it was night; the only concession that could be obtained from the young woman was that she would delay starting on her expedition until morning."

"Aux pieds du roi Guillaume, de Remilly à Frénois, les batteries presque ininterrompues tonnaient sans relâche, couvrant d’obus la Moncelle et Daigny, allant, par-dessus la ville de Sedan, balayer les plateaux du nord. Et il n’était guère plus de huit heures, et il attendait l’inévitable résultat de la bataille, les yeux sur l’échiquier géant, occupé à mener cette poussière d’hommes, l’enragement de ces quelques points noirs, perdus au milieu de l’éternelle et souriante nature.","At the feet of King William, from Remilly to Frénois, the almost uninterrupted batteries thundered relentlessly, covering La Moncelle and Daigny with shells, going over the town of Sedan to sweep across the northern plateaus.

"Ah ! cette marche au fond du défilé de Stonne, entre les hautes crêtes, tandis qu’à droite, derrière les bois, le canon continuait de tonner ! À la tête du 106e, le colonel de Vineuil se tenait raidi sur son cheval, la face blême et droite, les paupières battantes, comme pour contenir des larmes. Muet, le capitaine Beaudoin mordait ses moustaches, tandis que le lieutenant Rochas, sourdement, mâchait des gros mots, des injures contre tous et contre lui-même. Et, même parmi les soldats qui n’avaient pas envie de se battre, parmi les moins braves, un besoin de hurler et de cogner montait, la colère de la continuelle défaite, la rage de s’en aller encore à pas lourds et vacillants, pendant que ces sacrés Prussiens égorgeaient là-bas des camarades.","Ah! that march at the end of the defile of Stonne, between the high crests, while on the right, behind the woods, the cannon continued to thunder! At the head of the 106th, Colonel de Vineuil sat rigid on his horse, his face pale and erect, his eyelids fluttering as if to hold back tears. Mute, Captain Beaudoin bit his mustache, while Lieutenant Rochas silently chewed swear words, insults against everyone and himself. And, even among the soldiers who did not feel like fighting, among the less brave, a need to shout and thump rose, the anger of the continual defeat, the rage to still go with heavy and unsteady steps. , while those sacred Prussians cut the throats of their comrades over there.","And what a march! Deep in the gorge of Stonne between the high peaks, while to the right behind the woods the cannon went on roaring. At the head of the 106th Colonel de Vineuil rode bolt upright on his horse, with his ashen face raised and his eyelids blinking as though he were holding back his tears. Captain Beaudoin silently chewed his moustache, while Lieutenant Rochas was softly muttering obscenities and curses against everybody including himself. And even among those soldiers who did not want to fight, among the least brave, there was developing an urge to bawl and bang in anger at the continual defeat and rage at sloping off yet again with weary, uncertain steps while these bloody Prussians were slaughtering their comrades over yonder.","Ah, what a march was that through that dismal pass of Stonne, with the lofty summits o'erhanging them on either side, while through the woods on their right came the incessant volleying of the artillery. Colonel de Vineuil rode at the head of his regiment, bracing himself firmly in his saddle, his face set and very pale, his eyes winking like those of one trying not to weep. Captain Beaudoin strode along in silence, gnawing his mustache, while Lieutenant Rochas let slip an occasional imprecation, invoking ruin and destruction on himself and everyone besides. Even the most cowardly among the men, those who had the least stomach for fighting, were shamed and angered by their continuous retreat; they felt the bitter humiliation of turning their backs while those beasts of Prussians were murdering their comrades over yonder."

"En bas, il trouva Delaherche, qui avait voulu également coucher à sa teinturerie, un grand bâtiment de briques, dont le mur était mitoyen.

"Cependant, Maurice s’était remis à causer avec son beau-frère Weiss et son cousin Honoré Fouchard, le maréchal des logis. La retraite, venue de loin, peu à peu grossie, passa près d’eux, sonnante, battante, dans la paix mélancolique du crépuscule ; et ils ne semblèrent même pas l’entendre. Petit-fils d’un héros de la Grande Armée, le jeune homme était né, au Chesne-Populeux, d’un père détourné de la gloire, tombé à un maigre emploi de percepteur. Sa mère, une paysanne, avait succombé en les mettant au monde, lui et sa sœur jumelle Henriette, qui, toute petite, l’avait élevé. Et, s’il se trouvait là, engagé volontaire, c’était à la suite de grandes fautes, toute une dissipation de tempérament faible et exalté, de l’argent qu’il avait jeté au jeu, aux femmes, aux sottises de Paris dévorateur, lorsqu’il y était venu terminer son droit et que la famille s’était saignée pour faire de lui un monsieur. Le père en était mort, la sœur, après s’être dépouillée, avait eu la chance de trouver un mari, cet honnête garçon de Weiss, un Alsacien de Mulhouse, longtemps comptable à la Raffinerie générale du Chesne-Populeux, aujourd’hui contremaître chez M. Delaherche, un des principaux fabricants de drap de Sedan. Et Maurice se croyait bien corrigé, dans sa nervosité prompte à l’espoir du bien comme au découragement du mal, généreux, enthousiaste, mais sans fixité aucune, soumis à toutes les sautes du vent qui passe. Blond, petit, avec un front très développé, un nez et un menton menus, le visage fin, il avait des yeux gris et caressants, un peu fous parfois.","However, Maurice had resumed talking with his brother-in-law Weiss and his cousin Honoré Fouchard, the quartermaster. The retreat, coming from afar, gradually increasing, passed close to them, ringing, beating, in the melancholy peace of the twilight; and they didn't even seem to hear him. The grandson of a hero of the Grande Armée, the young man was born, in Chesne-Populeux, to a father diverted from glory, who fell into a meager job as a tax collector. His mother, a peasant, had died giving birth to him and his twin sister Henriette, who had raised him as a child. And, if he found himself there, enlisted as a volunteer, it was as a result of great faults, a whole dissipation of a weak and exalted temperament, of the money he had thrown at gambling, at women, at the nonsense of Paris. devourer, when he had come there to finish his right and the family had bled to make him a gentleman. The father had died of it, the sister, after stripping herself, had been lucky enough to find a husband, that honest fellow Weiss, an Alsatian from Mulhouse, a long-time accountant at the General Refinery of Chesne-Populeux, now foreman at M. Delaherche, one of the principal cloth-makers in Sedan. And Maurice thought himself well corrected, in his nervousness prompt to hope for good as well as discouragement of evil, generous, enthusiastic, but without any fixity, subject to all the swings of the passing wind. Fair-haired, small, with a very developed forehead, a small nose and chin, a fine face, he had caressing gray eyes, a little crazy at times.","Meanwhile Maurice had gone on talking to his brother-in-law Weiss and his cousin Honoré Fouchard, the artillery sergeant. Retreat, at first far distant, then gradually getting louder, passed near them, with its brass and drums in the melancholy quiet of dusk, but they did not even appear to notice it. The young man, grandson of a hero of the Grande Armée, was born at Le Chêne-Populeux, where his father, fighting shy of glory, had come down to a humble job of tax-collector. His mother, of peasant stock, had died bringing him and his twin sister Henriette into the world, and Henriette had looked after him from their earliest childhood. He was now here as a volunteer after a long series of misdeeds, the typical dissipations of a weak and excitable temperament, money thrown away on gambling, women and the follies of all-devouring Paris; and all that when he had gone there to finish his law studies and his people had bled themselves white to make a grand gentleman of him. This had hastened his father’s death, and his sister, having spent her all, had had the good fortune to find a husband, this reliable fellow Weiss, an Alsatian from Mulhouse, who had been a book-keeper for years at the General Refinery at Le Chêne-Populeux, and was now an overseer for Monsieur Delaherche, one of the biggest clothmakers in Sedan. And Maurice thought he had quite turned over a new leaf, with his nervy nature as quick to hope for the best as to be discouraged by the bad, generous, enthusiastic, but without the slightest stability, blown hither and thither by every passing gust of wind. Fair, small, with a very large head, small neat nose and chin, he had a clever face, with grey, affectionate eyes, a bit wild at times.","Meantime Maurice had resumed his conversation with his brother-in-law Weiss and his cousin Honore Fouchard, the quartermaster-sergeant. Retreat, commencing in the remote distance, then gradually swelling in volume as it drew near with its blare and rattle, reached them, passed them, and died away in the solemn stillness of the twilight; they seemed to be quite unconscious of it. The young man was grandson to a hero of the Grand Army, and had first seen the light at Chene-Populeux, where his father, not caring to tread the path of glory, had held an ill-paid position as collector of taxes. His mother, a peasant, had died in giving him birth, him and his twin sister Henriette, who at an early age had become a second mother to him, and that he was now what he was, a private in the ranks, was owing entirely to his own imprudence, the headlong dissipation of a weak and enthusiastic nature, his money squandered and his substance wasted on women, cards, the thousand follies of the all-devouring minotaur, Paris, when he had concluded his law studies there and his relatives had impoverished themselves to make a gentleman of him. His conduct had brought his father to the grave; his sister, when he had stripped her of her little all, had been so fortunate as to find a husband in that excellent young fellow Weiss, who had long held the position of accountant in the great sugar refinery at Chene-Populeux, and was now foreman for M. Delaherche, one of the chief cloth manufacturers of Sedan. And Maurice, always cheered and encouraged when he saw a prospect of amendment in himself, and equally disheartened when his good resolves failed him and he relapsed, generous and enthusiastic but without steadiness of purpose, a weathercock that shifted with every varying breath of impulse, now believed that experience had done its work and taught him the error of his ways. He was a small, light-complexioned man, with a high, well-developed forehead, small nose, and retreating chin, and a pair of attractive gray eyes in a face that indicated intelligence; there were times when his mind seemed to lack balance."
"Brusquement, il sentit le sol frémir sous le galop d’une charge enragée. Il se retourna, il n’eut que le temps de crier à sa compagne :","Suddenly, he felt the ground quiver under the gallop of an enraged charge. He turned around, he had only time to shout to his companion:",Suddenly he felt the ground shake under the galloping hoofs of a furious charge. He turned round and just had time to shout to Silvine:,"Suddenly he became aware that the ground was trembling under the thundering hoof-beats of a headlong charge. He turned to look, and had barely time to shout to his companion:"
"– Comment, vous ne vous êtes pas couchée ?","""What, you didn't go to bed?""","‘What, not in bed yet?’","“What, have you not been abed to-night?”"

Uhlans.","‘Look over there!’ he said, nudging Jean who was next to him. ‘Uhlans!’","“Look there!” he said, nudging Jean, who was marching at his side. “Uhlans!”"
"Dès le réveil, chaque matin, Honoré allait voir sa pièce, la faisait, sous ses yeux, essuyer de la rosée de la nuit, comme s’il eût bouchonné une bête aimée, par crainte des rhumes qu’elle pourrait prendre. Et il était là, paternellement, à la regarder luire dans l’air frais de l’aube, lorsqu’il reconnut Maurice.","As soon as he awoke, each morning, Honoré went to see his play, had it, under his eyes, wipe it with the dew of the night, as if he had corked a beloved animal, for fear of the colds it might catch. And he was there, fatherly, watching her glow in the cool dawn air, when he recognized Maurice.","Every morning as soon as he woke up Honoré went to inspect his gun and saw to it that the night’s dew was wiped off, just as he might have rubbed down a beloved horse for fear it might catch a chill. There he was with a fatherly eye, watching it gleaming in the cool morning air, when he caught sight of Maurice.","Not a morning passed that Honore failed to go and look after his piece, seeing to it that it was carefully dried and cleansed from the night dew, as if it had been a favorite animal that he was fearful might take cold, and there it was that Maurice found him, exercising his paternal supervision in the crisp morning air."
"– Et ça m’embête tout de même, parce que j’allais me marier, en rentrant chez moi.","– And it bothers me all the same, because I was going to get married, on my way home.","‘Still, it’s annoying, because I was going to get married when I got home.’","“And it is a pity, all the same, because I was to be married when I got my discharge.”"
"Puis, comme on faisait une courte halte pour laisser souffler les hommes, il lui donna un bon conseil.","Then, as we made a short halt to let the men breathe, he gave her some good advice.","Then, as they called a short halt to let the men get their breath back, he gave him a bit of good advice.","And as the men were halted just then for a breathing spell, he gave him a bit of good advice."
"Silvine, en approchant de la ferme, remarqua d’autres paysans, en train de creuser à la pioche de longues tranchées. Mais ceux-là étaient sous les ordres directs d’officiers prussiens, qui, une simple badine aux doigts, raides et muets, surveillaient l’ouvrage. On avait ainsi réquisitionné les habitants des villages pour enterrer les morts, dans la crainte que le temps pluvieux ne hâtât la décomposition. Deux chariots de cadavres étaient là, une équipe les déchargeait, les couchait rapidement côte à côte, en un rang pressé, sans les fouiller ni même les regarder au visage ; tandis que trois hommes, armés de grandes pelles, suivaient, recouvraient le rang d’une couche de terre si mince, que déjà, sous les averses, des gerçures fendillaient le sol. Avant quinze jours, tant ce travail était hâtif, la peste soufflerait par toutes ces fentes. Et Silvine ne put s’empêcher de s’arrêter au bord de la fosse, de les dévisager, à mesure qu’on les apportait, ces misérables morts. Elle frémissait d’une horrible crainte, avec l’idée, à chaque visage sanglant, qu’elle reconnaissait Honoré. N’était-ce pas ce malheureux dont l’œil gauche manquait ? ou celui-ci peut-être qui avait les mâchoires fendues ? Si elle ne se hâtait pas de le découvrir, sur ce plateau vague et sans fin, certainement qu’on allait le lui prendre et l’enfouir dans le tas, parmi les autres.","Silvine, approaching the farm, noticed other peasants digging long trenches with pickaxes. But these were under the direct orders of Prussian officers, who, with a simple cane on their fingers, stiff and mute, supervised the work. The inhabitants of the villages had thus been requisitioned to bury the dead, in fear that the rainy weather would hasten the decomposition. Two carts of corpses were there, a team was unloading them, quickly laying them down side by side, in a tight row, without searching them or even looking them in the face; while three men, armed with large shovels, followed, covering the row with a layer of earth so thin that already, under the showers, cracks were cracking the ground. Before two weeks, this work was so hasty, the plague would blow through all these cracks. And Silvine could not help stopping at the edge of the pit, staring at them as they were brought in, these wretched dead. She shuddered with horrible fear, with the idea, in each bleeding face, that she recognized Honoré. Wasn't it that wretch whose left eye was missing? Or maybe this one with split jaws? If she didn't hasten to discover it, on this vague and endless plateau, it would certainly be taken from her and buried in the heap, among the others.","As they were making for the farm Silvine saw other peasants digging long trenches. But these people were working under the direct orders of Prussian officers who were standing stiff and silent with just a switch in their hands, superintending the work. The inhabitants of the villages had been set to work to bury the dead for fear that the rainy weather might hasten decomposition. There were two cartloads of bodies and a gang was unloading them and quickly laying them side by side very close together, without searching them or even looking at their faces, and three men with large shovels followed on and covered the row with such a thin layer of earth that already the rain was opening up little cracks. So hastily was the job done that before a fortnight was up a pestilence would be rising through all these cracks. Silvine could not help stopping on the edge of the trench and looking at these pitiful bodies as they were brought along. She was shuddering with the horrible fear that in each bloody face she would recognize Honoré. Was he that dreadful one with no left eye? Or the one with the broken jaw? If she didn’t hurry up and find him on this featureless, endless plain they would certainly take him away from her and bury him in the dump with the others.","As they approached the farmhouse Silvine noticed other peasants engaged with spades and picks in digging long trenches; but these men were under the direct command of Prussian officers, who, with nothing more formidable than a light walking-stick in their hands, stood by, stiff and silent, and superintended the work. They had requisitioned the inhabitants of all the villages of the vicinity in this manner, fearing that decomposition might be hastened, owing to the rainy weather. Two cart-loads of dead bodies were standing near, and a gang of men was unloading them, laying the corpses side by side in close contiguity to one another, not searching them, not even looking at their faces, while two men followed after, equipped with great shovels, and covered the row with a layer of earth, so thin that the ground had already begun to crack beneath the showers. The work was so badly and hastily done that before two weeks should have elapsed each of those fissures would be breathing forth pestilence. Silvine could not resist the impulse to pause at the brink of the trench and look at those pitiful corpses as they were brought forward, one after another. She was possessed by a horrible fear that in each fresh body the men brought from the cart she might recognize Honore. Was not that he, that poor wretch whose left eye had been destroyed? No! Perhaps that one with the fractured jaw was he? The one thing certain to her mind was that if she did not make haste to find him, wherever he might be on that boundless, indeterminate plateau, they would pick him up and bury him in a common grave with the others."

"Delaherche, dès qu’il avait perdu de vue le général, s’était hâté de retourner à la fabrique, possédé d’une idée unique, celle de monter de nouveau à son observatoire, pour suivre au loin les événements. Mais, comme il arrivait, il fut un instant arrêté, en se heurtant, sous le porche, au colonel de Vineuil, qu’on amenait, avec sa botte sanglante, à moitié évanoui sur du foin, au fond d’une carriole de maraîcher. Le colonel s’était obstiné à vouloir rallier les débris de son régiment, jusqu’au moment où il était tombé de cheval. Tout de suite, on le monta dans une chambre du premier étage, et Bouroche qui accourut, n’ayant trouvé qu’une fêlure de la cheville, se contenta de panser la plaie, après en avoir retiré des morceaux de cuir de la botte. Il était débordé, exaspéré, il redescendit en criant qu’il aimerait mieux se couper une jambe à lui-même, que de continuer à faire son métier si salement, sans le matériel convenable ni les aides nécessaires. En bas, en effet, on ne savait plus où mettre les blessés, on s’était décidé à les coucher sur la pelouse, dans l’herbe. Déjà, il y en avait deux rangées, attendant, se lamentant au plein air, sous les obus qui continuaient à pleuvoir. Le nombre des hommes amenés à l’ambulance, depuis midi, dépassait quatre cents, et le major avait fait demander des chirurgiens, sans qu’on lui envoyât autre chose qu’un jeune médecin de la ville. Il ne pouvait suffire, il sondait, taillait, sciait, recousait, hors de lui, désolé de voir qu’on lui apportait toujours plus de besogne qu’il n’en faisait. Gilberte, ivre d’horreur, prise de la nausée de tant de sang et de larmes, était restée près de son oncle, le colonel, laissant en bas madame Delaherche donner à boire aux fiévreux et essuyer les visages moites des agonisants.","Delaherche, as soon as he had lost sight of the general, had hastened to return to the factory, possessed of a single idea, that of going up again to his observatory, to follow events from afar. But, as he arrived, he was stopped for a moment, when he bumped into Colonel de Vineuil under the porch, who was being led with his bloody boot, half fainting on some hay, at the bottom of a market gardener's cart. . The colonel had persisted in trying to rally the remnants of his regiment until he fell from his horse. He was immediately taken up to a room on the first floor, and Bouroche, who rushed up, having found only a crack in his ankle, contented himself with dressing the wound, after removing pieces of leather from the boot. He was overwhelmed, exasperated, he came downstairs shouting that he would rather cut off his own leg than continue to do his job so dirty, without the proper equipment or the necessary aids. Downstairs, in fact, we no longer knew where to put the wounded, we had decided to lay them down on the lawn, in the grass. Already there were two rows of them, waiting, lamenting in the open air, under the shells which continued to rain. The number of men brought to the ambulance since noon exceeded four hundred, and the major had asked for surgeons, but nothing but a young doctor from the town was sent to him. He couldn't do enough, he probed, hewed, sawed, sewed up, beside himself, sorry to see that more work was always brought to him than he was doing. Gilberte, intoxicated with horror, seized with the nausea of so much blood and tears, had remained near her uncle, the Colonel, leaving Madame Delaherche downstairs to give the feverish people a drink and to wipe the clammy faces of the dying.","As soon as he had lost sight of the general, Delaherche hurried back to his mill with but one idea in his head, which was to go up again to his observation post and follow events from a distance. But on reaching home he was held up for a moment by running into Colonel de Vineuil, who was being brought in with his blood-soaked boot, half unconscious on some hay in the bottom of a farm cart. The colonel had insisted on trying to rally the remnants of his regiment until he had fallen off his horse. He was taken straight up to a first-floor room, and Bouroche hurried up but found it was only a cracked ankle-bone and so merely bandaged the wound after extracting bits of boot-leather. He was overwhelmed and at the end of his tether, and rushed down again shouting that he would rather cut off one of his own legs than go on doing his job in such a messy way, without proper materials or the essential assistance. And indeed down below they had reached the stage of not knowing where to put the wounded, and had decided to put them on the lawn, in the grass. There were already two rows of them waiting and loudly complaining in the open air, with shells still coming down. The number of men brought in to the station since noon was over four hundred, and the major had asked for more surgeons, but all they had sent was one young doctor from the town. He simply could not cope with it, and he examined, cut through flesh, sawed through bones and sewed up again almost beside himself and in despair at seeing more work being brought than he was getting through. Gilberte was sick with horror and overcome with nausea at so much blood and tears, and she had stayed with her uncle the colonel, leaving Madame Delaherche down below to give drinks to the fevered and wipe the sweating faces of the dying.","Upon losing sight of the general at the Minil gate Delaherche had hurried back to the factory at the best speed he was capable of, impelled by an irresistible longing to have another look from his observatory at what was going on in the distance. Just as he reached his door, however, his progress was arrested a moment by encountering Colonel de Vineuil, who, with his blood-stained boot, was being brought in for treatment in a condition of semi-consciousness, upon a bed of straw that had been prepared for him on the floor of a market-gardener's wagon. The colonel had persisted in his efforts to collect the scattered fragments of his regiment until he dropped from his horse. He was immediately carried upstairs and put to bed in a room on the first floor, and Bouroche, who was summoned at once, finding the injury not of a serious character, had only to apply a dressing to the wound, from which he first extracted some bits of the leather of the boot. The worthy doctor was wrought up to a high pitch of excitement; he exclaimed, as he went downstairs, that he would rather cut off one of his own legs than continue working in that unsatisfactory, slovenly way, without a tithe of either the assistants or the appliances that he ought to have. Below in the ambulance, indeed, they no longer knew where to bestow the cases that were brought them, and had been obliged to have recourse to the lawn, where they laid them on the grass. There were already two long rows of them, exposed beneath the shrieking shells, filling the air with their dismal plaints while waiting for his ministrations. The number of cases brought in since noon exceeded four hundred, and in response to Bouroche's repeated appeals for assistance he had been sent one young doctor from the city. Good as was his will, he was unequal to the task; he probed, sliced, sawed, sewed like a man frantic, and was reduced to despair to see his work continually accumulating before him. Gilberte, satiated with sights of horror, unable longer to endure the sad spectacle of blood and tears, remained upstairs with her uncle, the colonel, leaving to Mme. Delaherche the care of moistening fevered lips and wiping the cold sweat from the brow of the dying."

"– Ah ! mes pauvres amis ! balbutia-t-il, stupéfait, bouleversé, lui qui arrivait le sourire aux lèvres, l’air bonhomme et pas fier, dans son désir de popularité.","– Ah! my poor friends! he stammered, amazed, upset, he who arrived with a smile on his face, looking good-natured and not proud, in his desire for popularity.","And Delaherche hadn’t even noticed. ‘Oh my poor friends,’ he stammered, dumbfounded, deflated, having come with a smile on his lips and the jolly man-to-man tone he adopted in his desire for popularity.","“Ah, my poor friends!” he stammered, utterly crestfallen in his bewilderment and stupefaction, he who but a moment before had come through the gate with a smile on his lips and an air of good-fellowship, magnanimously forgetting his superior advantages in his desire for popularity."
"Il fallait se résigner pourtant. Maurice expliqua que l’eau, après avoir bouilli, ne serait plus dangereuse.","However, we had to resign ourselves.

"Déjà, Silvine entrait dans la maison, dont les fenêtres et les portes défoncées bâillaient à l’air humide. En effet, il n’y avait évidemment là personne, les maîtres devaient être partis avant la bataille. Puis, comme elle s’entêtait et qu’elle pénétrait dans la cuisine, elle laissa de nouveau échapper un cri d’effroi. Sous l’évier, deux corps avaient roulé, un zouave, un bel homme à barbe noire, et un Prussien énorme, les cheveux rouges, tous les deux enlacés furieusement. Les dents de l’un étaient entrées dans la joue de l’autre, les bras raidis n’avaient pas lâché prise, faisant encore craquer les colonnes vertébrales rompues, nouant les deux corps d’un tel nœud d’éternelle rage, qu’il allait falloir les enterrer ensemble.","Already Silvine was entering the house, whose broken windows and doors gaped in the damp air. Indeed, there was obviously no one there, the masters must have left before the battle. Then, as she persisted and entered the kitchen, she again let out a cry of fear. Under the sink two bodies had rolled, a Zouave, a handsome man with a black beard, and an enormous Prussian, with red hair, both entwined furiously. The teeth of one had entered the cheek of the other, the stiffened arms had not let go, still cracking the broken spinal columns, tying the two bodies in such a knot of eternal rage, that they would have to be buried together.","Silvine was already entering the house, the battered doors and windows of which were gaping and open to the wet. There was nobody there, of course, the owners must have gone before the battle. But as she insisted on going on as far as the kitchen she uttered another scream. Two bodies had rolled under the sink, a Zouave, a fine man with a black beard, and a huge Prussian with red hair, and the two were locked in a furious embrace. One had his teeth sunk into the other’s cheek, their arms had stiffened in death but not let go and were still cracking each other’s broken spines. The two bodies were tied together in such a knot of eternal hatred that they would have to be buried together.","Silvine entered the house, the doors and windows of which had been battered in and afforded admission to the damp, cold air from without. It was clear enough that there was no one there; the masters must have taken their departure before the battle. She continued to prosecute her search, however, and had entered the kitchen, when she gave utterance to another cry of terror. Beneath the sink were two bodies, fast locked in each other's arms in mortal embrace, one of them a zouave, a handsome, brown-bearded man, the other a huge Prussian with red hair. The teeth of the former were set in the latter's cheek, their arms, stiff in death, had not relaxed their terrible hug, binding the pair with such a bond of everlasting hate and fury that ultimately it was found necessary to bury them in a common grave."
"Même les hommes n’avaient plus le soulagement de décharger leurs chassepots. Le capitaine Beaudoin était parvenu à faire cesser le feu, cette furieuse et inutile fusillade contre le petit bois d’en face, où pas un Prussien ne paraissait être resté. Le soleil devenait accablant, on brûlait, ainsi allongé par terre, sous le ciel en flammes.","Even the men no longer had the relief of unloading their Chassepots. Captain Beaudoin had succeeded in putting an end to the fire, this furious and useless fusillade against the little wood opposite, where not a Prussian seemed to have remained. The sun was becoming oppressive, we were burning, thus lying on the ground, under the sky in flames.","And now the men had not even the relief of letting off their own rifles. Captain Beaudoin had managed to stop the firing, a furious and pointless fusillade against the little wood opposite, in which not a single Prussian seemed to have stayed. The sun was scorching and they were baked alive, lying like this on the ground under a blazing sky.","They were even denied the relief of discharging their chassepots. Captain Beaudoin had at last put his foot down and stopped the firing, that senseless fusillade against the little wood in front of them, which seemed entirely deserted by the Prussians. The heat was stifling; it seemed to them that they should roast, stretched there on the ground under the blazing sky."

"Mais les chevaux avaient sauté l’obstacle, il n’y eut qu’un roulement de foudre, et déjà ils galopaient de l’autre côté, s’engouffrant dans un chemin creux, jusqu’à la corne d’un bois, derrière lequel ils disparurent.","But the horses had jumped the obstacle, there was only a roll of lightning, and already they were galloping on the other side, engulfing themselves in a sunken path, up to the horn of a wood, behind which they disappeared.","But they leaped over the obstacle and nothing was left but the rumbling of thunder, and already they were galloping off in another direction and diving into a sunken road and on to the corner of a wood behind which they vanished.","But the horses had taken the obstacle in their stride and were already scouring away in the distance on the other side with a rumble like that of a receding thunder-storm; striking into a sunken road they pursued it as far as the corner of a little wood, behind which they were lost to sight."
"Mais, plus loin, les abominables chansons, les cris sauvages recommencèrent. Et il arriva ainsi, un peu après Chaumont, que le train en croisa un autre, chargé d’artilleurs, que l’on devait conduire à Metz. La marche venait d’être ralentie, les soldats des deux trains fraternisèrent dans une effroyable clameur. Du reste, ce furent les artilleurs, plus ivres sans doute, debout, les poings hors des wagons, qui l’emportèrent, en jetant ce cri, avec une telle violence désespérée, qu’il couvrait tout :","But, further on, the abominable songs, the savage cries began again. And so it happened, a little after Chaumont, that the train passed another, loaded with artillerymen, who were to be taken to Metz. The march had just been slowed down, the soldiers of the two trains fraternized in a terrible clamor. For the rest, it was the artillerymen, no doubt more drunk, standing with their fists out of the wagons, who carried it off, uttering this cry, with such desperate violence, that it drowned out everything:","Yet a little further on the filthy songs and savage yellings began again. A little beyond Chaumont the train happened to pass another one full of artillerymen being taken to Metz. Speed had been reduced, and the soldiers in the two trains fraternized in an infernal din. And possibly because they were more drunk, it was the artillerymen who won as they stood waving their fists out of the trucks and shouting everything else down with the violence of desperation:","But as soon as they were under way again the filthy songs and the wild shouts began afresh, and so it went on until, a little while after leaving Chaumont, they met another train that was conveying some batteries of artillery to Metz. The locomotives slowed down and the soldiers in the two trains fraternized with a frightful uproar. The artillerymen were also apparently very drunk; they stood up in their seats, and thrusting hands and arms out of the car-windows, gave this cry with a vehemence that silenced every other sound:"
"Le major resta quelques secondes étourdi par cette idée du drapeau blanc, de la défaite, de la capitulation, qui tombait au milieu de son impuissance à sauver tous les pauvres bougres en bouillie, qu’on lui amenait.

Rage and grief were in his voice as he shouted:"
"D’ailleurs, une nouvelle voiture d’ambulance entrait, ils durent la laisser passer. Celle-ci, plus petite, à deux roues seulement, contenait deux grands blessés, couchés sur des sangles. Le premier qu’on descendit, avec toutes sortes de précautions, n’était plus qu’une masse de chairs sanglantes, une main cassée, le flanc labouré par un éclat d’obus. Le second avait la jambe droite broyée. Et tout de suite Bouroche, faisant placer celui-ci sur la toile cirée du matelas, commença la première opération, au milieu du continuel va-et-vient des infirmiers et de ses aides. Madame Delaherche et Gilberte, assises près de la pelouse, roulaient des bandes.","Besides, a new ambulance car was coming in, they had to let it pass. This one, smaller, with only two wheels, contained two seriously wounded, lying on straps. The first one to be lowered, with all sorts of precautions, was nothing more than a mass of bloody flesh, a broken hand, the side plowed by a shrapnel. The second had his right leg crushed. And immediately Bouroche, having him placed on the oilcloth of the mattress, began the first operation, in the midst of the continual coming and going of the orderlies and their assistants. Madame Delaherche and Gilberte, seated near the lawn, were rolling up tapes.","But as another ambulance vehicle was coming in they had to let it pass. This was smaller, with only two wheels, containing two badly wounded lying on stretchers. The first one they brought out, with infinite care, was nothing but a mass of bleeding flesh with one hand smashed and the whole of one side torn through by a shell splinter. The second one had his right leg crushed. At once Bouroche had this one placed on the mattress and began the first operation, with orderlies and his assistants ceaselessly running to and fro. Madame Delaherche and Gilberte were sitting near the lawn, rolling bandages.","Another ambulance had driven up, moreover, and they had to wait to let it pass in. It was smaller than the other, having but two wheels, and the two men whom it contained, both severely wounded, rested on stretchers placed upon the floor. The first one whom the attendants took out, using the most tender precaution, had one hand broken and his side torn by a splinter of shell; he was a mass of bleeding flesh. The second had his left leg shattered; and Bouroche, giving orders to extend the latter on one of the oil-cloth-covered mattresses, proceeded forthwith to operate on him, surrounded by the staring, pushing crowd of dressers and assistants. Madame Delaherche and Gilberte were seated near the grass-plot, employed in rolling bandages."
"Et, le dos contre son oreiller, en face de la fenêtre qu’il avait forcé sa sœur à ouvrir, montrant la ville redevenue noire, qu’un nouveau reflet de fournaise éclairait :","And, with his back against his pillow, facing the window he had forced his sister to open, showing the town, which had turned black again, lit by a new reflection of a furnace:","Propped against his pillow, facing the window he had forced his sister to open, he pointed to the city, now in darkness again but lit up by a new glow from a fire:","And supported by the pillows at his back, his face to the window which he had forced his sister to open for him, he pointed with his finger to the city, where, on the gathering darkness, the lambent flames were beginning to rise anew."
"Mais il n’osait l’emmener ainsi, en manches de chemise. Une brusque inspiration le fit courir dans une rue voisine, où il avait vu un soldat mort, et il revint avec une capote et un képi. Il lui jeta la capote sur les épaules, l’aida à passer son bras valide, dans la manche gauche. Puis, quand il l’eut coiffé du képi :","But he dared not take her like this, in shirt sleeves. A sudden inspiration made him run into a nearby street, where he had seen a dead soldier, and he came back with a greatcoat and a kepi. He threw the greatcoat over her shoulders, helped her put his good arm through her left sleeve. Then, when he had put the cap on his head:","But he dared not take him away like that, in his shirtsleeves. On a sudden inspiration he ran round the corner, where he had seen a dead soldier, and he came back with a greatcoat and a képi. He threw the coat over his shoulders and helped him to put his good arm into the left sleeve. Then, having stuck the képi on his head:","But he did not dare to take him through the streets thus, in his shirt sleeves. Remembering to have seen a dead soldier lying in an adjacent street, he hurried off and presently came back with a capote and a kepi. He threw the greatcoat over his friend's shoulders and assisted him to slip his uninjured arm into the left sleeve. Then, when he had put the kepi on his head:"
"Alors, Delaherche se sentit isolé, envahi d’une détresse affreuse. La faim le reprenait, intolérable, et il crut que la faiblesse seule lui ôtait ainsi tout courage. Sur la pointe des pieds, il quitta la chambre, descendit de nouveau dans la cuisine, avec le bougeoir. Mais il y trouva plus de mélancolie encore, le fourneau éteint, le buffet vide, les torchons jetés en désordre, comme si le vent du désastre avait soufflé là aussi, emportant toute la gaieté vivante de ce qui se mange et de ce qui se boit. D’abord, il crut qu’il ne découvrirait pas même une croûte, les restes de pain ayant passé à l’ambulance, dans la soupe. Puis, au fond d’une armoire, il tomba sur des haricots de la veille, oubliés. Et il les mangea sans beurre, sans pain, debout, n’osant remonter pour faire un pareil repas, se hâtant au milieu de cette cuisine morne, que la petite lampe vacillante empoisonnait d’une odeur de pétrole.","So Delaherche felt isolated, overwhelmed with terrible distress. Hunger seized him again, intolerable, and he believed that weakness alone thus deprived him of all courage. On tiptoe, he left the bedroom, went down again into the kitchen, with the candlestick. But he found even more melancholy there, the stove extinguished, the sideboard empty, the dishcloths thrown in disorder, as if the wind of disaster had blown there too, carrying away all the living gaiety of what is eaten and what is drunk. . At first he thought he wouldn't find even a crust, the remains of the bread having gone to the ambulance, in the soup. Then, at the bottom of a cupboard, he came across beans from the day before, forgotten. And he ate them without butter, without bread, standing up, not daring to go back upstairs to have such a meal, hurrying through the dreary kitchen, which the flickering little lamp poisoned with the smell of petroleum.","So Delaherche felt isolated and filled with dreadful distress. His unbearable hunger was coming on again, and he thought it must just be weakness that was draining him in this way of all his courage. He tiptoed out of the room and went down to the kitchen again, candlestick in hand. But he found it drearier than ever, with the stove out, the cupboard bare and cloths thrown all over the place as if the wind of disaster had blown through there and taken with it all the life and joy of anything that can be eaten or drunk. At first he thought he would not discover even a crust, for the odd bits of bread had gone down to the ambulance station in the soup. But then in the back of a cupboard he came upon some of yesterday’s beans that had been overlooked. He devoured them with neither butter nor bread, standing there and not daring to go upstairs for such a meal, which he hurried through in this dismal kitchen which the guttering little lamp made stink of paraffin.","About that time Delaherche became conscious of a sensation of isolation, accompanied by a most uncomfortable feeling of physical distress. His hunger was asserting itself again, a griping, intolerable hunger, and he persuaded himself that it was debility alone that was thus robbing him of courage and resolution. He tiptoed softly from the room and, with his candle, again made his way down to the kitchen, but the spectacle he witnessed there was even still more cheerless; the range cold and fireless, the closets empty, the floor strewn with a disorderly litter of towels, napkins, dish-clouts and women's aprons; as if the hurricane of disaster had swept through that place as well, bearing away on its wings all the charm and cheer that appertain naturally to the things we eat and drink. At first he thought he was not going to discover so much as a crust, what was left over of the bread having all found its way to the ambulance in the form of soup. At last, however, in the dark corner of a cupboard he came across the remainder of the beans from yesterday's dinner, where they had been forgotten, and ate them. He accomplished his luxurious repast without the formality of sitting down, without the accompaniment of salt and butter, for which he did not care to trouble himself to ascend to the floor above, desirous only to get away as speedily as possible from that dismal kitchen, where the blinking, smoking little lamp perfumed the air with fumes of petroleum."
Mais elle eut un geste d’indifférence.,But she made a gesture of indifference.,She made a gesture of indifference.,But she apathetically replied:
"Dans le village de Balan, la pluie cessa. Prosper décida Silvine à manger un morceau de pain qu’il avait eu la précaution d’emporter. Il était déjà onze heures. Mais, comme ils arrivaient près de Sedan, un poste prussien les arrêta encore ; et, cette fois, ce fut terrible, l’officier s’emportait, refusait même de rendre le laissez-passer, qu’il déclarait faux, en un français très correct, d’ailleurs. Des soldats, sur son ordre, avaient poussé l’âne et la petite charrette sous un hangar. Que faire ? comment continuer la route ? Silvine, qui se désespérait, eut alors une idée, en songeant au cousin Dubreuil, ce parent du père Fouchard, qu’elle connaissait et dont la propriété, l’Ermitage, se trouvait à quelques cents pas, en haut des ruelles dominant le faubourg. Peut-être l’écouterait-on, lui, un bourgeois. Elle emmena Prosper, puisqu’on les laissait libres, à la condition de garder la charrette. Ils coururent, ils trouvèrent la grille de l’Ermitage grande ouverte. Et, de loin, comme ils s’engageaient dans l’allée des ormes séculaires, un spectacle qu’ils aperçurent les étonna beaucoup.","In the village of Balan, the rain stopped. Prosper persuaded Silvine to eat a piece of bread which he had taken the precaution of taking away. It was already eleven o'clock. But, as they arrived near Sedan, a Prussian post again stopped them; and, this time, it was terrible, the officer lost his temper, even refused to return the laissez-passer, which he declared to be false, in very correct French, moreover. Soldiers, at his command, had pushed the donkey and the little cart under a shed. What to do ? how to continue the road? Silvine, who was in despair, then had an idea, thinking of cousin Dubreuil, this relative of Father Fouchard, whom she knew and whose property, the Hermitage, was a few hundred paces away, at the top of the alleys dominating the faubourg . Perhaps we would listen to him, a bourgeois. She took Prosper away, since they were left free, on condition that they keep the cart. They ran, they found the gate of the Hermitage wide open. And, from afar, as they entered the alley of secular elms, a sight which they saw astonished them greatly.","The rain stopped when they were in the village of Balan. Prosper persuaded Silvine to eat a bit of bread that he had had the forethought to bring with him. It was eleven already. As they neared Sedan a Prussian post stopped them once again, and this time it was terrible, for the officer shouted at them and even refused to return their pass, which he said was forged – in very good French, moreover. On his orders soldiers had taken the donkey and trap into a shed. What was to be done? How could they go on? Almost at her wit ’s end, Silvine had an idea; she thought of cousin Dubreuil, a relation of old Fouchard, whom she knew and whose property, L’Ermitage, was only about a hundred paces away up the lanes, overlooking the neighbourhood. Perhaps they would take some notice of him, a local resident. She took Prosper with her, for they were quite free to come and go so long as they left the cart. They hurried up there and found the gate of L’Ermitage wide open. As they began to walk along the avenue of great elms they were amazed at the sight that met their eyes.","By the time they reached Balan the rain had ceased, and Prosper prevailed on Silvine to eat a bit of the bread he had had the foresight to bring with them. When they were near Sedan, however, they were brought to a halt by another Prussian post, and this time the consequences threatened to be serious; the officer stormed at them, and even refused to restore their pass, which he declared, in excellent French, to be a forgery. Acting on his orders some soldiers had run the donkey and the little cart under a shed. What were they to do? were they to be forced to abandon their undertaking? Silvine was in despair, when all at once she thought of M. Dubreuil, Father Fouchard's relative, with whom she had some slight acquaintance and whose place, the Hermitage, was only a few hundred yards distant, on the summit of the eminence that overlooked the faubourg. Perhaps he might have some influence with the military, seeing that he was a citizen of the place. As they were allowed their freedom, conditionally upon abandoning their equipage, she left the donkey and cart under the shed and bade Prosper accompany her. They ascended the hill on a run, found the gate of the Hermitage standing wide open, and on turning into the avenue of secular elms beheld a spectacle that filled them with amazement."
"Et Gaude, alors, avec sa face douloureuse d’homme qui avait eu des chagrins dont il ne parlait jamais, fut pris d’une folie héroïque. Dans cette défaite dernière, tout en sachant que la compagnie était anéantie, que pas un homme ne pouvait venir à son appel, il empoigna son clairon, l’emboucha, sonna au ralliement, d’une telle haleine de tempête, qu’il semblait vouloir faire se dresser les morts. Et les Prussiens arrivaient, et il ne bougeait pas, sonnant plus fort, à toute fanfare. Une volée de balles l’abattit, son dernier souffle s’envola en une note de cuivre, qui emplit le ciel d’un frisson.","And Gaude, then, with the sorrowful face of a man who had had sorrows of which he never spoke, was seized with heroic madness. In this last defeat, while knowing that the company was annihilated, that not a man could come to his call, he seized his bugle, mouthed it, sounded the rallying sound, with such a stormy breath, that it seemed want to raise the dead. And the Prussians were coming, and he didn't move, ringing louder, to all fanfare. A volley of bullets felled him, his last breath flowing away in a note of copper, which filled the sky with a shiver.","Then Gaude, with that doleful face of his, suggesting the man who has had his troubles but never refers to them, was seized with heroic bravado. In this final defeat, well knowing that the company was wiped out and not a single man could answer his call, he seized his bugle, put it to his lips and blew Fall In with such a blast that he seemed to want to make the dead rise to their feet. The Prussians were nearly there, but he never budged, blowing louder still, a complete fanfare. A shower of bullets struck him down, and his last breath flew away in a brassy note and filled the sky with shuddering.","Then Gaude, with his sorrowful face, the face of a man who has had his troubles of which he does not care to speak, was seized with a sort of sudden heroic madness. At that moment of irretrievable defeat, when he must have known that the company was annihilated and that there was not a man left to answer his summons, he grasped his bugle, carried it to his lips and sounded the general, in so tempestuous, ear-splitting strains that one would have said he wished to wake the dead. Nearer and nearer came the Prussians, but he never stirred, only sounding the call the louder, with all the strength of his lungs. He fell, pierced with many bullets, and his spirit passed in one long-drawn, parting wail that died away and was lost upon the shuddering air."

"À la porte, Henriette embrassa tendrement Maurice. Puis, elle tendit la main à Jean, garda la sienne quelques secondes, dans une étreinte amicale.","At the door, Henriette kissed Maurice tenderly. Then she held out her hand to Jean, held hers for a few seconds, in a friendly embrace.","As they were leaving Henriette kissed Maurice tenderly. Then she put out her hand to Jean and held his in her own for a few seconds, in a friendly grip.","Henriette went with them to the door, where she embraced Maurice tenderly and gave Jean a warm clasp of the hand."

"Elle se leva toute droite, elle eut un cri et tomba entre les bras du jeune homme. Elle ne pouvait parler, tout le sang de ses veines était à son visage. Il s’était assis sur la chaise, il l’avait prise sur ses genoux.","She got up straight, she gave a cry and fell into the arms of the young man. She couldn't speak, all the blood in her veins was in her face. He had sat down on the chair, he had taken her on his knees.","She jumped up, and with a cry fell into the young man’s arms. She could not speak, and all the blood in her veins seemed to be in her face. He sat down on the chair and took her on his knee.","She rose and stood erect upon her feet, gave a cry of joy, and threw herself upon the young man's bosom. She could not speak a word; every drop of blood in her veins was in her cheeks. He seated himself upon the chair and drew her down upon his lap."
"Vers cinq heures, comme Maurice et les camarades se repliaient décidément derrière les barricades de la rue du Bac, descendant de porte en porte la rue de Lille, en tirant toujours, il vit tout d’un coup une grosse fumée noire sortir par une fenêtre ouverte du palais de la Légion d’honneur. C’était le premier incendie allumé dans Paris ; et, sous le coup de furieuse démence qui l’emportait, il en eut une joie farouche. L’heure avait sonné, que la ville entière flambât donc comme un bûcher immense, que le feu purifiât le monde ! Mais une apparition brusque l’étonna : cinq ou six hommes venaient de sortir précipitamment du palais, ayant à leur tête un grand gaillard, dans lequel il reconnut Chouteau, son ancien camarade d’escouade du 106e. Il l’avait aperçu déjà avec un képi galonné, après le 18 mars, il le retrouvait monté en grade, ayant des galons partout, attaché à l’état-major de quelque général qui ne se battait pas. Une histoire lui revint, qu’on lui avait contée : ce Chouteau installé au palais de la Légion d’honneur, vivant là en compagnie d’une maîtresse dans une bombance continuelle, s’allongeant avec ses bottes au milieu des grands lits somptueux, cassant les glaces à coups de revolver, pour rire. Même on assurait que sa maîtresse, sous le prétexte d’aller faire son marché aux Halles, partait chaque matin en voiture de gala, déménageant des ballots de linge volé, des pendules et jusqu’à des meubles. Et Maurice, à le voir courir avec ses hommes, tenant encore à la main un bidon de pétrole, éprouva un malaise, un doute affreux où il sentit vaciller toute sa foi. L’œuvre terrible pouvait donc être mauvaise, qu’un tel homme en était l’ouvrier ?","Around five o'clock, as Maurice and his comrades were resolutely withdrawing behind the barricades of the rue du Bac, going down the rue de Lille from door to door, still firing, he suddenly saw a thick black smoke coming out of a window. open to the Palace of the Legion of Honor. It was the first fire lit in Paris; and, under the stroke of furious madness which carried him away, he felt a fierce joy. The hour had come, that the whole city should blaze like an immense pyre, that the fire purify the world! But a sudden appearance astonished him: five or six men had just left the palace in a hurry, led by a tall fellow, in whom he recognized Chouteau, his former squad mate of the 106th. He had already seen him with a braided kepi, after March 18, he found him raised in rank, with braids everywhere, attached to the staff of some general who did not fight. A story came back to him, which had been told to him: this Chouteau installed in the palace of the Legion of Honor, living there in the company of a mistress in a continual feast, stretching out with his boots in the middle of the large sumptuous beds, breaking the windows with revolver shots, for fun. It was even said that his mistress, under the pretext of going to the market at Les Halles, left every morning in a gala car, moving bales of stolen linen, clocks and even furniture. And Maurice, seeing him running with his men, still holding a can of oil in his hand, felt a sense of uneasiness, a terrible doubt in which he felt all his faith waver. The terrible work could therefore be bad, that such a man was the workman?","By five, as Maurice and his comrades were definitely withdrawing behind the barricades in the rue du Bac, going down the rue de Lille from doorway to doorway firing the while, he suddenly saw a lot of black smoke coming out of a window of the Palace of the Legion of Honour. It was the first case of incendiarism in Paris, and in his state of wild rage it filled him with fierce joy. The hour had struck, let the whole city go up in flames like a huge bonfire, and let fire purify the world! Then he was amazed at what he suddenly saw – five or six men had rushed out of the Palace with a great lout at their head whom he recognized as Chouteau, his old comrade in the squad in the 106th. He had already seen him once since 18 March and found him much up-graded, his képi covered all over with gold braid, and attached to the staff of some general who had kept clear of the fighting. He recalled a story somebody had told about Chouteau being installed in the Palace of the Legion of Honour and living there with a mistress on one continual binge, sprawling on great sumptuous beds with his boots on and breaking the mirrors with pistol shots just for a lark. It was even alleged that his mistress, on the pretext of going shopping in the market, went off every morning in a state coach taking bundles of stolen linen, clocks and even furniture. Now, seeing him running along with his men, still holding a can of paraffin oil, Maurice suddenly felt uneasy and a dreadful doubt came over him and made his whole faith waver. Could this terrible work of destruction be an evil thing, since it was being done by a man like that?","About five o'clock, as Maurice and his companions were finally falling back to seek the shelter of the barricades in the Rue du Bac, descending the Rue de Lille and pausing at every moment to fire another shot, he suddenly beheld volumes of dense black smoke pouring from an open window in the Palace of the Legion of Honor. It was the first fire kindled in Paris, and in the furious insanity that possessed him it gave him a fierce delight. The hour had struck; let the whole city go up in flame, let its people be cleansed by the fiery purification! But a sight that he saw presently filled him with surprise: a band of five or six men came hurrying out of the building, headed by a tall varlet in whom he recognized Chouteau, his former comrade in the squad of the 106th. He had seen him once before, after the 18th of March, wearing a gold-laced kepi; he seemed by his bedizened uniform to have risen in rank, was probably on the staff of some one of the many generals who were never seen where there was fighting going on. He remembered the account somebody had given him of that fellow Chouteau, of his quartering himself in the Palace of the Legion of Honor and living there, guzzling and swilling, in company with a mistress, wallowing with his boots on in the great luxurious beds, smashing the plate-glass mirrors with shots from his revolver, merely for the amusement there was in it. It was even asserted that the woman left the building every morning in one of the state carriages, under pretense of going to the Halles for her day's marketing, carrying off with her great bundles of linen, clocks, and even articles of furniture, the fruit of their thieveries. And Maurice, as he watched him running away with his men, carrying a bucket of petroleum on his arm, experienced a sickening sensation of doubt and felt his faith beginning to waver. How could the terrible work they were engaged in be good, when men like that were the workmen?"
"Elle ne nommait ni les Prussiens, ni Weiss. Tout le monde devait comprendre. Maurice, en effet, comprit. Il l’adorait, il eut un sanglot.","She named neither the Prussians nor Weiss. Everyone had to understand. Maurice, indeed, understood. He adored her, he sobbed.","She never named the Prussians or Weiss. Everybody must understand, and Maurice certainly did. He was devoted to his sister and he burst into tears.",She did not mention either Weiss or the Prussians by name; it seemed to her that everyone must understand. Maurice did understand. It made his heart bleed; he gave a great sob.

La jeune femme eut un bel éclat de rire.,The young woman chuckled.,Gilberte went into a peal of laughter.,The young woman laughed merrily.
"Mais, devant eux, une longue figure s’était dressée. Ils reconnurent Rochas, drapé encore de son manteau, et que les bruits errants, le souffle de la défaite peut-être venait de tirer de son dur sommeil. Il questionna, voulut savoir.","But before them a long figure had risen. They recognized Rochas, still draped in his cloak, and whom the wandering noises, perhaps the breath of defeat had just awakened from his hard sleep. He questioned, wanted to know.","At that moment a lanky figure rose up in front of them. It was Rochas, still draped in his greatcoat, who had been awakened out of his heavy sleep by the vague noises, and possibly by the wind of defeat. He questioned them, wanted to know.","But a tall figure arose before them. They recognized Rochas, still wrapped in his long mantle, whom the fugitive sounds about him, or it may have been the intuition of disaster, had awakened from his uneasy slumber. He questioned them, insisted on knowing all."

"Lapoulle, ahuri, se souleva, parut comprendre, hurla un : Présent ! D’une telle voix de sauvage, que Loubet en tomba sur le derrière, tant il le trouva farce. Pache, qui avait fini sa couture, répondit, à peine distinct, d’un marmottement de prière. Chouteau, dédaigneusement, sans même se lever, jeta le mot et s’étala davantage.","Lapoulle, bewildered, rose, seemed to understand, shouted a: Present! In such a savage voice that Loubet fell on his ass, he thought it so much of a joke. Pache, who had finished his sewing, replied, barely distinct, with a prayerful mumble. Chouteau, disdainfully, without even getting up, threw the note away and sprawled further.","Lapoulle leaped up in a daze, seemed to understand and bellowed ‘Present’ in such a savage roar that it made Loubet fall on his backside, it was such a scream. Pache, who had finished his sewing, answered almost inaudibly, like muttering a prayer. Chouteau, full of scorn, didn’t even get up, but called out the word and stretched himself out a little more.","Lapoulle rose to his feet with a dazed look on his face, then appeared to grasp the situation and yelled: “Present!” in such stentorian tones that Loubet, pretending to be upset by the concussion, sank to the ground in a sitting posture. Pache had finished mending his trousers and answered in a voice that was barely audible, that sounded more like the mumbling of a prayer. Chouteau, not even troubling himself to rise, grunted his answer unconcernedly and turned over on his side."

"Quand ils eurent à leur tour quitté la ferme, Maurice et Jean galopèrent par les pentes raides. En bas, ils ne trouvèrent plus le 106e ; tous les régiments étaient déjà en branle ; et ils durent courir encore, on les renvoya, à droite, à gauche. Enfin, la tête perdue, au milieu d’une effroyable confusion, ils tombèrent sur leur compagnie, que conduisait le lieutenant Rochas ; quant au capitaine Beaudoin et au régiment lui-même, ils étaient sans doute ailleurs. Et Maurice fut alors stupéfié, en constatant que cette cohue d’hommes, de bêtes, de canons, sortait de Remilly et remontait du côté de Sedan, par la route de la rive gauche. Quoi donc ? qu’arrivait-il ? on ne passait plus la Meuse, on battait en retraite vers le nord !","When they in turn had left the farm, Maurice and Jean galloped up the steep slopes. Below, they could not find the 106th; all the regiments were already in motion; and they had to run again, they were sent back, to the right, to the left. At last, their heads lost, in the midst of a frightful confusion, they fell upon their company, led by Lieutenant Rochas; as for Captain Beaudoin and the regiment itself, they were doubtless elsewhere. And Maurice was then amazed, on noticing that this throng of men, beasts, cannons, was leaving Remilly and going up towards Sedan, by the road on the left bank. What ? what happened? we were no longer crossing the Meuse, we were beating a retreat towards the north!","When they too had left the farmhouse, Maurice and Jean galloped down the steep slopes. At the bottom they found no sign of the 106th; all the regiments were already on the move, and they had to keep running and were redirected right and left. But in the end, when they were frantic in the dreadful confusion, they fell in with their company, led by Lieutenant Rochas. As for Captain Beaudoin and the regiment itself, they were somewhere or other, no doubt. And then Maurice was astounded to see that this multitude of men, horses and guns was leaving Remilly and making for Sedan along the road on the left bank. What on earth was going on? So they had given up crossing the Meuse and were retreating northwards!","Maurice and Jean also left the farmhouse, and descended the steep hill on a run. When they reached the bottom the 106th was nowhere to be found; the regiments had all moved off. They made inquiries, running this way and that, and were directed first one way and then another. At last, when they had near lost their wits in the fearful confusion, they stumbled on their company, under the command of Lieutenant Rochas; as for the regiment and Captain Beaudoin, no one could say where they were. And Maurice was astounded when he noticed for the first time that that mob of men, guns, and horses was leaving Remilly and taking the Sedan road that lay on the left bank. Something was wrong again; the passage of the Meuse was abandoned, they were in full retreat to the north!"

It bothers me a lot to be forced to leave tonight… But my wife will arrange that for you, she is irresistible, she gets everything she wants.","‘So you have come to consult us about Papa Fouchard’s fate?’ Delaherche went on. ‘I’m so sorry to have to go away tonight… But my wife will fix it up for you, she’s irresistible and gets everything she wants.’","“So you want us to interest ourselves in Father Fouchard's case, and it's to that we owe the pleasure of your visit, eh?” said the manufacturer. “I'm extremely sorry that I have to go away to-night, but my wife will set things straight for you in a jiffy; there's no resisting her, she has only to ask for a thing to get it.”"

"– Oh ! répétait rageusement Maurice, le tenir, celui-là, et lui tirer tout son sang, goutte à goutte !","- Oh ! repeated Maurice furiously, hold him, that one, and draw all his blood out of him, drop by drop!","‘Oh!’ Maurice raged again. ‘Oh to get hold of that man and let out all his blood, drop by drop!’","“Oh!” Maurice furiously exclaimed, “to get the puppy in my hands and drain him of his blood, drop by drop!”"
"Non, il était de la compagnie Ravaud. Mais il connaissait tout de même le caporal Jean Macquart, il crut pouvoir dire que l’escouade de celui-ci n’avait pas encore été engagée. Et ce renseignement, si vague, suffit pour donner de la joie à la jeune femme : son frère vivait, elle serait tout à fait soulagée, lorsqu’elle aurait embrassé son mari, qu’elle continuait à attendre d’une minute à l’autre.","No, he was from the Ravaud company. But he knew Corporal Jean Macquart all the same, he thought he could say that his squad had not yet been engaged. And this information, so vague, was enough to give joy to the young woman: her brother was alive, she would be quite relieved when she had kissed her husband, when she continued to wait from one minute to the next. other.","No, he was in Ravaud’s. But he did know Corporal Jean Macquart, and thought he was right in saying that his squad had not yet been in action. This very vague piece of information was enough to cheer her up, though; her brother was alive so far, and she would be quite all right when she had embraced her husband, whom she was still expecting at any minute.","No, he belonged to Captain Bonnaud's company, but for all that he was well acquainted with Corporal Macquart and felt pretty certain that his squad had not been under fire as yet. The tidings, meager as they were, sufficed to remove a great load from the young woman's heart: her brother was alive and well; if now her husband would only return, as she was expecting every moment he would do, her mind would be quite at rest."
"Mais les ordres étaient formels, les officiers durent commander la retraite, désolés de ne pouvoir tirer profit de l’avantage qu’ils venaient de remporter. Évidemment, le général Ducrot, hanté par la crainte du mouvement tournant de l’ennemi, sacrifiait tout à la tentative folle d’échapper à son étreinte. La place de l’Église fut évacuée, les troupes se replièrent de ruelle en ruelle, bientôt la route se vida. Des cris et des sanglots de femmes s’élevaient, des hommes juraient, brandissaient les poings, dans la colère de se voir ainsi abandonnés. Beaucoup s’enfermaient chez eux, résolus à s’y défendre et à mourir.","But the orders were formal, the officers had to order the retreat, sorry not to be able to take advantage of the advantage they had just gained. Obviously, General Ducrot, haunted by the fear of the turning movement of the enemy, sacrificed everything to the mad attempt to escape his embrace. The Place de l'Eglise was evacuated, the troops retreated from alley to alley, soon the road emptied. Screams and sobs of women arose, men swore, brandished their fists, in anger at seeing themselves thus abandoned. Many locked themselves in their homes, determined to defend themselves there and die.","But the command was clear, officers had to order a retreat, however upset they were at not being able to take advantage of the success they had had. Obviously General Ducrot, haunted by fear of being encircled by the enemy, was sacrificing everything to the crazy attempt to get out of their clutches. The church square was evacuated, the troops fell back from alley to alley and soon the street was empty. Women were heard crying and wailing, men were swearing and brandishing their fists in anger at seeing themselves abandoned in this way. Many shut themselves in their houses, resolved to defend themselves and die.","But the instructions of the new chief were imperative, and the officers, vexed and grieved to see the successes they had achieved thus rendered nugatory, had nothing for it but to give orders for the retreat. It was plain that the commander-in-chief, possessed by a haunting dread of the enemy's turning movement, was determined to sacrifice everything in order to escape from the toils. The Place de l'Eglise was evacuated, the troops fell back from street to street; soon the broad avenue was emptied of its defenders. Women shrieked and sobbed, men swore and shook their fists at the retiring troops, furious to see themselves abandoned thus. Many shut themselves in their houses, resolved to die in their defense."
"Mais, entre les doigts crispés d’Honoré, elle aperçut un papier, taché de sang. Alors, elle s’inquiéta, tâcha d’avoir ce papier, à petites secousses. Le mort ne voulait pas le rendre, le retenait, si étroitement, qu’on ne l’aurait arraché qu’en morceaux. C’était la lettre qu’elle lui avait écrite, la lettre gardée par lui entre sa peau et sa chemise, serrée ainsi comme pour un adieu, dans la convulsion dernière de l’agonie. Et, lorsqu’elle l’eut reconnue, elle fut pénétrée d’une joie profonde, au milieu de sa douleur, toute bouleversée de voir qu’il était mort en pensant à elle. Ah ! certes, oui ! elle la lui laisserait, la chère lettre ! elle ne la reprendrait pas, puisqu’il tenait si obstinément à l’emporter dans la terre. Une nouvelle crise de larmes la soulagea, des larmes tièdes et douces maintenant. Elle s’était relevée, elle lui baisait les mains, elle lui baisa le front, en ne répétant toujours que ce mot d’infinie caresse :","But, between Honoré's clenched fingers, she saw a piece of paper, stained with blood. Then she got worried, tried to get this paper, with little jerks. The dead man did not want to give it up, held it so tightly that it could only be torn off in pieces. It was the letter she had written to him, the letter kept by him between his skin and his shirt, squeezed thus as if for a farewell, in the final convulsion of agony. And, when she had recognized him, she was filled with deep joy, in the midst of her pain, completely overwhelmed to see that he had died thinking of her. Ah! of course, yes! she would leave it to him, the dear letter! she would not take it back, since he insisted so obstinately on carrying it into the earth. Another burst of tears relieved her, warm, sweet tears now. She got up, she kissed his hands, she kissed his forehead, always repeating only this word of infinite caress:","Then she caught sight of a bloodstained piece of paper clutched in Honoré’s fingers, and anxiously tried to pull it out in little jerks. The dead man refused to give it up and held on so tight that it could only have been torn away in pieces. It was the letter she had written him, that he had kept between his skin and his shirt, and he had squeezed it in his hand for a farewell in death’s final convulsion. Recognizing it, she was filled with a deep joy in the midst of her grief and quite overwhelmed by this proof that he had died thinking of her. Oh yes, yes, she would let him keep the beloved letter, and not take it from him as he was so determined to take it with him into the earth. A fresh outburst of weeping brought her some relief, for her tears were warm and sweet now. She stood up, kissed his hands and his forehead, repeating the one word of infinite love:","She caught sight of a bit of blood-stained paper between Honore's stiffened fingers. It troubled her; she tried to gain possession of the paper, pulling at it gently, but the dead man would not surrender it, seemingly tightening his hold on it, guarding it so jealously that it could not have been taken from him without tearing it in bits. It was the letter she had written him, that he had always carried next his heart, and that he had taken from its hiding place in the moment of his supreme agony, as if to bid her a last farewell. It seemed so strange, was such a revelation, that he should have died thinking of her; when she saw what it was a profound delight filled her soul in the midst of her affliction. Yes, surely, she would leave it with him, the letter that was so dear to him! she would not take it from him, since he was so bent on carrying it with him to the grave. Her tears flowed afresh, but they were beneficent tears this time, and brought healing and comfort with them. She arose and kissed his hands, kissed him on the forehead, uttering meanwhile but that one word, which was in itself a prolonged caress:"
"– Comment peuvent-ils encore être là ? murmurait Prosper, de plus en plus stupéfié, à mesure qu’il avançait. Les bougres, ils se fichent donc des Prussiens ?","- How can they still be there? muttered Prosper, more and more stupefied as he advanced. So the buggers don't care about the Prussians?","‘But how can they still be here?’ muttered Prosper, still more amazed as he went nearer. ‘Don’t the buggers care two hoots about the Prussians?’","“But how in the world do they happen to be here?” murmured Prosper, whose stupefaction increased as he drew nearer to them. “Have the rascals forgotten there are Prussians about?”"
"Il sembla qu’un grand froid, un vent glacial de charnier passait.

"– Pardi ! ce n’est pas malin, reprit Chouteau, ça s’explique, puisque nous sommes vendus… Vous le savez bien tous.","- Go away! it's not smart, Chouteau went on, it's understandable, since we're sold. You all know it.","The imaginings of these overgrown children, at first so fertile in wild hopes, were now collapsing into wild nightmares. ‘Of course it’s easy enough to see,’ went on Chouteau, ‘it’s got a simple explanation, we’ve been sold down the river… You all know that.’","“Pardi!” continued Chouteau, “the thing is accounted for easily enough, since our rulers have been selling us to the enemy right from the beginning.

General de Wimpffen has set out again for the German headquarters to sign the capitulation.” Ah, how much those words meant to him, what comfort there was in them,"
"Mais le roi Guillaume, fatigué, lâcha un instant sa lorgnette ; et il continua de regarder à l’œil nu. Le soleil oblique descendait vers les bois, allait se coucher dans un ciel d’une pureté sans tache. Toute la vaste campagne en était dorée, baignée d’une lumière si limpide, que les moindres détails prenaient une netteté singulière. Il distinguait les maisons de Sedan, avec les petites barres noires des fenêtres, les remparts, la forteresse, ce système compliqué de défense dont les arêtes se découpaient d’un trait vif. Puis, alentour, épars au milieu des terres, c’étaient les villages, frais et vernis, pareils aux fermes des boîtes de jouets, Donchery à gauche, au bord de sa plaine rase, Douzy et Carignan à droite, dans les prairies. Il semblait qu’on aurait compté les arbres de la forêt des Ardennes, dont l’océan de verdure se perdait jusqu’à la frontière. La Meuse, aux lents détours, n’était plus, sous cette lumière frisante, qu’une rivière d’or fin. Et la bataille atroce, souillée de sang, devenait une peinture délicate, vue de si haut, sous l’adieu du soleil : des cavaliers morts, des chevaux éventrés semaient le plateau de Floing de taches gaies ; vers la droite, du côté de Givonne, les dernières bousculades de la retraite amusaient l’œil du tourbillon de ces points noirs, courant, se culbutant ; tandis que, dans la presqu’île d’Iges, à gauche, une batterie bavaroise, avec ses canons gros comme des allumettes, avait l’air d’être une pièce mécanique bien montée, tellement la manœuvre pouvait se suivre, d’une régularité d’horlogerie. C’était la victoire, inespérée, foudroyante, et le roi n’avait pas de remords, devant ces cadavres si petits, ces milliers d’hommes qui tenaient moins de place que la poussière des routes, cette vallée immense où les incendies de Bazeilles, les massacres d’Illy, les angoisses de Sedan, n’empêchaient pas l’impassible nature d’être belle, à cette fin sereine d’un beau jour.","But King William, tired, dropped his telescope for a moment; and he continued to watch with the naked eye. The slanting sun was descending towards the woods, about to set in a sky of spotless purity. The whole vast countryside was gilded with it, bathed in a light so limpid that the smallest details took on a singular clarity. He could make out the houses of Sedan, with the little black bars of the windows, the ramparts, the fortress, that complicated system of defense whose edges stood out with a sharp line. Then, all around, scattered in the middle of the land, there were the villages, fresh and varnished, like toy-box farms, Donchery on the left, on the edge of its level plain, Douzy and Carignan on the right, in the meadows. It seemed as if one could have counted the trees of the forest of the Ardennes, whose ocean of greenery was lost as far as the border. The Meuse, with its slow detours, was nothing more, under this curling light, than a river of fine gold. And the atrocious battle, stained with blood, became a delicate painting, seen from so high, under the farewell of the sun: dead horsemen, disemboweled horses strewn the plateau of Floing with gay spots; to the right, on the side of Givonne, the last jostling of the retreat amused the eye with the whirlwind of these black points, running, tumbling; while, in the peninsula of Iges, on the left, a Bavarian battery, with its guns the size of matches, looked like a well-assembled mechanical piece, so easily could the maneuver be followed. clockwork regularity. It was victory, unexpected, overwhelming, and the king had no remorse, in front of these corpses so small, these thousands of men who took up less space than the dust of the roads, this immense valley where the fires of Bazeilles , the massacres of Illy, the anguish of Sedan, did not prevent the impassive nature from being beautiful, at this serene end of a fine day.","King William, who was getting tired, gave up using his field glasses for a minute and went on watching with the naked eye. The slanting sun was descending towards the woods and was about to set in a pure cloudless sky. It gilded the whole vast panorama, and shed on it such a clear light that the smallest details stood out with striking clarity. He could pick out the houses of Sedan, with their little black bars across the windows, the ramparts, the fortress, the complicated defensive system with its ridges in high relief. And scattered all round in the countryside, the fresh, gaily-painted villages looked like toy farms, Donchery to his left, on the edge of its flat plain, Douzy and Carignan to his right in the meadows. You could almost have counted the trees of the forest of the Ardennes, and its ocean of green stretched out of sight to the frontier. In this horizontal light the Meuse, with its meanderings, had become a river of pure gold. The atrocious, bloody battle itself, seen from such a height in the setting sun, was like a delicate painting: dead horsemen and disembowelled horses flecked the plateau of Floing with gay splashes of colour; further to the right, towards Givonne, the final scramble of the retreat made an interesting picture with the whirling of black dots running about and falling over themselves; and again in the Iges peninsula to the left a Bavarian battery with its guns the size of matches looked like a piece of nicely adjusted mechanism, for the eye could follow its regular, clockwork movements. It was unhoped-for, overwhelming victory, and the King had no remorse, faced as he was by these tiny corpses, these thousands of men less than the dust on the roads, the great vale in which the fires of Bazeilles, the slaughter of Illy, the anguish of Sedan, could not prevent unfeeling nature from being beautiful at this serene end of a perfect day.","But King William, to give his tired eyes a moment's rest, dropped his glass to his side and continued his observations with unassisted vision. The sun was slanting downward to the woods on his left, about to set in a sky where there was not a cloud, and the golden light that lay upon the landscape was so transcendently clear and limpid that the most insignificant objects stood out with startling distinctness. He could almost count the houses in Sedan, whose windows flashed back the level rays of the departing day-star, and the ramparts and fortifications, outlined in black against the eastern sky, had an unwonted aspect of frowning massiveness. Then, scattered among the fields to right and left, were the pretty, smiling villages, reminding one of the toy villages that come packed in boxes for the little ones; to the west Donchery, seated at the border of her broad plain; Douzy and Carignan to the east, among the meadows. Shutting in the picture to the north was the forest of the Ardennes, an ocean of sunlit verdure, while the Meuse, loitering with sluggish current through the plain with many a bend and curve, was like a stream of purest molten gold in that caressing light. And seen from that height, with the sun's parting kiss resting on it, the horrible battlefield, with its blood and smoke, became an exquisite and highly finished miniature; the dead horsemen and disemboweled steeds on the plateau of Floing were so many splashes of bright color; on the right, in the direction of Givonne, those minute black specks that whirled and eddied with such apparent lack of aim, like motes dancing in the sunshine, were the retreating fragments of the beaten army; while on the left a Bavarian battery on the peninsula of Iges, its guns the size of matches, might have been taken for some mechanical toy as it performed its evolutions with clockwork regularity. The victory was crushing, exceeding all that the victor could have desired or hoped, and the King felt no remorse in presence of all those corpses, of those thousands of men that were as the dust upon the roads of that broad valley where, notwithstanding the burning of Bazeilles, the slaughter of Illy, the anguish of Sedan, impassive nature yet could don her gayest robe and put on her brightest smile as the perfect day faded into the tranquil evening."

"Et ce fut, pour Maurice, une véritable stupéfaction, lorsqu’il vit arriver, par cette route de Monthois, la division Margueritte, toute cette cavalerie de réserve, chargée de soutenir le 7e corps et d’éclairer le flanc gauche de l’armée. Le bruit courut qu’elle remontait vers le Chesne-Populeux. Pourquoi dégarnissait-on ainsi l’aile qui seule était menacée ? Pourquoi faisait-on passer au centre, où ils devaient être d’une inutilité absolue, ces deux mille cavaliers, qu’on aurait dû lancer en éclaireurs, à des lieues de distance ? Le pis était que, tombant au milieu des mouvements du 7e corps, ils avaient failli en couper les colonnes, dans un inextricable embarras d’hommes, de canons et de chevaux. Des chasseurs d’Afrique durent attendre pendant près de deux heures, à la porte de Vouziers.","And it was, for Maurice, a real stupefaction, when he saw arriving, by this road of Monthois, the division Margueritte, all this cavalry of reserve, charged to support the 7th corps and to illuminate the left flank of the army. . It was rumored that she was going up towards Chesne-Populeux. Why were they stripping the wing, which alone was threatened? Why were these two thousand horsemen, who should have been sent as scouts, leagues away, passed through the centre, where they must have been absolutely useless? The worst was that, falling in the midst of the movements of the 7th Corps, they had nearly cut off its columns, in an inextricable embarrassment of men, cannons and horses. Chasseurs d'Afrique had to wait for nearly two hours at the Porte de Vouziers.","Maurice was completely thunderstruck when he saw coming along the Monthois road the Margueritte division – all the reserve cavalry whose job was to support the 7th corps and scout for the left flank of the army. It was rumoured that it was making for Le Chêne-Populeux. Why leave unprotected the one wing that was threatened? Why take these two thousand horsemen, who should have been deployed as scouts many leagues away, and move them to the centre where they must be absolutely useless? The worst of it was that as they blundered right into the manoeuvres of the 7th they nearly cut up its columns into an inextricable muddle of men, guns and horses. Some of the Chasseurs d’Afrique had to wait nearly two hours outside Vouziers.","Soon after midday, however, the 1st and 3d divisions had passed through the city and encamped in the meadows on the farther bank of the Aisne, while a brigade of the second, which included the 106th, had remained upon the left bank, bivouacking among the waste lands of which the low foot-hills overlooked the valley, observing from their position the Monthois road, which skirts the stream and by which the enemy was expected to make his appearance. And Maurice was dumfoundered to behold advancing along that Monthois road Margueritte's entire division, the body of cavalry to which had been assigned the duty of supporting the 7th corps and watching the left flank of the army. The report was that it was on its way to Chene-Populeux. Why was the left wing, where alone they were threatened by the enemy, stripped in that manner? What sense was there in summoning in upon the center, where they could be of no earthly use, those two thousand horsemen, who should have been dispersed upon our flank, leagues away, as videttes to observe the enemy? And what made matters worse was that they caused the greatest confusion among the columns of the 7th corps, cutting in upon their line of march and producing an inextricable jam of horses, guns, and men. A squadron of chasseurs d'Afrique were halted for near two hours at the gate of Vouziers, and by the merest chance Maurice stumbled on Prosper, who had ridden his horse down to the bank of a neighboring pond to let him drink, and the two men were enabled to exchange a few words."
"Et il le dévisageait, vêtu d’une sorte de capote en gros drap bleu, coiffé d’une casquette de même étoffe, l’air cossu et content de lui. Du reste, il n’avait aucun accent, parlait avec la lenteur empâtée des paysans du pays.","And he was staring at him, dressed in a kind of greatcoat made of coarse blue cloth, wearing a cap of the same material, looking well-to-do and pleased with himself. Besides, he had no accent, spoke with the thick slowness of the peasants of the country.","He had a good look at him; he was wearing a sort of cape of coarse blue cloth and a cap of the same material, and looking prosperous and pleased with himself. Of course he had no German accent, but spoke the thick, slow speech of the peasants of that region.","And he eyed him from head to foot as he stood there, clad in a sort of soldier's greatcoat of coarse blue cloth, with a cap of the same material, wearing a comfortable, prosperous air of self-content.

"– Ah ! répéta Rose, ça se gâte, je le comprends bien, à la mine de ces messieurs.

It's like my tablecloth, I won't see it again, some people say it was torn... the Marshal, he would be better off in his bed than in this room, where he gnaws at himself constantly walking.","‘Oh,’ Rose said again, ‘it’s all going to pieces, I can tell from those gentlemen’s faces. Now there’s that cloth of mine, that I shan’t see again! Some of them say it’s been torn up… In all this it’s the Emperor who makes me feel so sorry, for he’s more of a sick man than the marshal, and would be better off in bed than in that room where he’s wearing himself out with always walking up and down.’","“Ah!” said Rose, “things are going badly; I can see that clearly enough by all those gentlemen's faces. It is bad for my tablecloth, too; I am afraid I shall never see it again; somebody told me it had been torn in pieces. But it is for the Emperor that I feel most sorry in all this business, for he is in a great deal worse condition than the marshal; he would be much better off in his bed than in that room, where he is wearing himself out with his everlasting walking.”"

"Malgré l’abomination des temps, un garçon de plus n’était pas de trop, chez le père Fouchard, dont les affaires prospéraient.

Lui, qui, le 30, défendait sa porte contre les soldats du 7e corps, le fusil au poing, refusant de leur vendre une miche, leur criant que la maison était vide, s’était établi marchand de tout, le 31, à l’apparition du premier soldat ennemi, avait déterré de ses caves des provisions extraordinaires, ramené des trous inconnus, où il les avait cachés, de véritables troupeaux. Et, depuis ce jour, il était un des plus gros fournisseurs de viande des armées allemandes, étonnant d’adresse pour placer sa marchandise et se la faire payer, entre deux réquisitions. Les autres souffraient de l’exigence parfois brutale des vainqueurs : lui n’avait pas encore fourni un boisseau de farine, un hectolitre de vin, un quartier de bœuf, sans trouver au bout du bel argent sonnant. On en causait bien, dans Remilly, on trouvait cela vilain de la part d’un homme qui venait de perdre à la guerre son fils, dont il ne visitait point la tombe, que Silvine seule entretenait. Mais, tout de même, on le respectait, de s’enrichir, quand les plus malins y laissaient leur peau. Et lui, goguenard, haussait les épaules, grognait, avec sa carrure têtue :","Despite the abomination of the times, one more boy was not too much, with Father Fouchard, whose business was prospering. While the whole country groaned, bleeding in all four limbs, he had found a way to expand his trade as an itinerant butcher so much that he slaughtered at this hour triple and quadruple the number of animals. It was said how, from the 31st of August, he had made superb bargains with the Prussians. He, who on the 30th was defending his door against the soldiers of the 7th corps, gun in hand, refusing to sell them a loaf, shouting to them that the house was empty, had established himself as a dealer in everything on the 31st, at the The appearance of the first enemy soldier, had unearthed from his cellars extraordinary provisions, brought back from the unknown holes, where he had hidden them, veritable herds. And, from that day on, he was one of the biggest suppliers of meat to the German armies, surprisingly skillful in placing his goods and getting paid for them, between two requisitions. The others suffered from the sometimes brutal demands of the victors: he had not yet provided a bushel of flour, a hectolitre of wine, a quarter of beef, without finding handsome silver at the end of it. We talked about it a lot, in Remilly, we thought it ugly on the part of a man who had just lost his son in the war, whose grave he never visited, whom Silvine alone cared for. But, all the same, we respected it, to get rich, when the smartest lost their skin. And he, mockingly, shrugged his shoulders, growled, with his stubborn build:","In spite of the terrible times an additional hand was not superfluous at old Fouchard’s, for his business affairs were doing well. While the whole region was in agonies and bleeding in every limb he had contrived to increase his trade as itinerant butcher to such an extent that he was now slaughtering three or four times as many animals. It was said that by 31 August he had had highly profitable dealings with the Prussians. The man who on the 30th had defended his door against the soldiers of the 7th corps, with his gun cocked and refusing to sell them a single crumb, shouting that his house was empty, had set up as a general trader on the 31st at the appearance of the first enemy soldier, and had unearthed from his cellars huge quantities of provisions, and brought back vast flocks from remote fastnesses where they had been hidden. From that day onwards he had been one of the biggest suppliers of meat to the German armies, and quite astonishing in his skill at finding a market for his goods and getting paid between two requisitions. Other people suffered from the often brutal commandeerings of the victors, but he had not yet supplied a single bushel of flour, cask of wine or quarter of beef without picking up good hard cash at the end of the transaction. This gave rise to much talk in Remilly, and it was considered pretty low on the part of a man who had just lost his son in the war and never went to visit his grave, which Silvine was the only one to look after. Yet all the same he was respected for making money when even the most astute came off so badly. And he just grinned, shrugged and growled in his straight-from-the-shoulder manner:","Notwithstanding the hardness of the times Father Fouchard could well afford to take on another hand, for his affairs were prospering. While the whole country was in the throes of dissolution and bleeding at every limb, he had succeeded in so extending his butchering business that he was now slaughtering three and even four times as many animals as he had ever done before. It was said that since the 31st of August he had been carrying on a most lucrative business with the Prussians. He who on the 30th had stood at his door with his cocked gun in his hand and refused to sell a crust of bread to the starving soldiers of the 7th corps had on the following day, upon the first appearance of the enemy, opened up as dealer in all kinds of supplies, had disinterred from his cellar immense stocks of provisions, had brought back his flocks and herds from the fastnesses where he had concealed them; and since that day he had been one of the heaviest purveyors of meat to the German armies, exhibiting consummate address in bargaining with them and in getting his money promptly for his merchandise. Other dealers at times suffered great inconvenience from the insolent arbitrariness of the victors, whereas he never sold them a sack of flour, a cask of wine or a quarter of beef that he did not get his pay for it as soon as delivered in good hard cash. It made a good deal of talk in Remilly; people said it was scandalous on the part of a man whom the war had deprived of his only son, whose grave he never visited, but left to be cared for by Silvine; but nevertheless they all looked up to him with respect as a man who was making his fortune while others, even the shrewdest, were having a hard time of it to keep body and soul together. And he, with a sly leer out of his small red eyes, would shrug his shoulders and growl in his bull-headed way:"
"Bouleversée, elle répondit affirmativement, d’un signe de tête ; et, comme elle venait enfin lui donner ses deux mains, dans un besoin d’affection et de secours, il reprit :","Shocked, she answered in the affirmative, with a nod; and, as she finally came to give him her two hands, in need of affection and help, he continued:","But she was shattered, and merely nodded an affirmative. Then, as she came over and gave him both her hands, in need of affection and help, he went on:","She answered with an affirmative motion of the head, and as she came toward him, extending her two hands in her great need of sympathy and support, he added:"
"Il n’avait pas ouvert la bouche depuis le réveil, l’air enfoncé dans une rêverie, avec sa grêle figure aux grands beaux yeux et au petit nez pincé.","He hadn't opened his mouth since waking up, looking sunk in reverie, with his slender face with large beautiful eyes and a pinched little nose.","He hadn’t opened his mouth since reveille, but was lost in a dream, with his delicate face, large beautiful eyes and prim little nose.","It was the first time he had opened his lips that morning; an expression of dreamy melancholy had rested on his thin face, with its big, handsome eyes and thin, pinched nose."

"Sur le plateau de l’Algérie, à dix heures, la compagnie Beaudoin était toujours couchée parmi les choux, dans le champ dont elle n’avait pas bougé depuis le matin. Les feux croisés des batteries du Hattoy et de la presqu’île d’Iges, qui redoublaient de violence, venaient encore de lui tuer deux hommes ; et aucun ordre de marcher en avant n’arrivait : allait-on passer la journée là, à se laisser mitrailler, sans se battre ?","On the plateau of Algeria, at ten o'clock, the Beaudoin company was still lying among the cabbage, in the field from which it had not moved since the morning. The crossfire from the batteries of Hattoy and the peninsula of Iges, which redoubled in violence, had just killed two more men; and no order to march forward arrived: were we going to spend the day there, letting ourselves be machine-gunned, without a fight?","AT ten o’clock up on the plateau of Algérie Beaudoin’s company was still lying among the cabbages, not having moved from that field since first thing. The cross-fire from the batteries of Le Hattoy and the Iges peninsula was increasing in intensity and had just killed two more of their men, and still no order to advance. Were they going to spend all day there, to be shot down without a fight?","It was nearly ten o'clock up on the Plateau de l'Algerie, and still the men of Beaudoin's company were resting supine, among the cabbages, in the field whence they had not budged since early morning. The cross fire from the batteries on Hattoy and the peninsula of Iges was hotter than ever; it had just killed two more of their number, and there were no orders for them to advance. Were they to stay there and be shelled all day, without a chance to see anything of the fighting?"
"À Mouzon, malgré cette leçon terrible, Maurice fut de nouveau hanté par son idée fixe de fuir. On était arrivé dans un tel état de lassitude, que les Prussiens durent aider les prisonniers, pour dresser les quelques tentes mises à leur disposition. Le campement se trouvait, près de la ville, dans un terrain bas et marécageux ; et le pis était qu’un autre convoi y ayant campé la veille, le sol disparaissait sous l’ordure : un véritable cloaque, d’une saleté immonde. Il fallut, pour se protéger, étaler à terre de larges pierres plates, qu’on eut la chance de découvrir près de là. La soirée, d’ailleurs, fut moins dure, la surveillance des Prussiens se relâchait un peu, depuis que le capitaine avait disparu, installé sans doute dans quelque auberge. D’abord, les sentinelles tolérèrent que des enfants jetassent aux prisonniers des fruits, des pommes et des poires, par-dessus leurs têtes. Ensuite, elles laissèrent les habitants du voisinage envahir le campement, de sorte qu’il y eut bientôt une foule de marchands improvisés, des hommes et des femmes qui débitaient du pain, du vin, même des cigares. Tous ceux qui avaient de l’argent, mangèrent, burent, fumèrent. Sous le pâle crépuscule, cela mettait comme un coin de marché forain, d’une bruyante animation.","In Mouzon, despite this terrible lesson, Maurice was again haunted by his fixed idea of fleeing. We had arrived in such a state of weariness that the Prussians had to help the prisoners to erect the few tents placed at their disposal. The encampment was near the town, in low, marshy ground; and the worst was that another convoy having camped there the day before, the ground was disappearing under the filth: a veritable cesspool, filthy filth. To protect themselves, they had to spread large flat stones on the ground, which we were lucky enough to discover near there. The evening, moreover, was less harsh, the surveillance of the Prussians had relaxed a little since the captain had disappeared, installed no doubt in some inn. At first, the sentries tolerated children throwing fruits, apples and pears, over their heads at the prisoners. Then they let the people of the neighborhood invade the camp, so that there was soon a crowd of improvised merchants, men and women selling bread, wine, even cigars. Everyone who had money ate, drank, smoked. In the pale twilight, it looked like a corner of a fairground market, bustling with activity.","At Mouzon, in spite of this terrible object-lesson, Maurice was once again plagued by his obsession to escape. They were now in such a state of weariness that the Prussians had to help their prisoners to put up the few tents available. The camp site was in a low-lying and marshy position near the town, and the worst of it was that as another party had camped there the day before the ground was almost covered with excrement – it was a real cesspool, disgustingly filthy. They had to keep themselves out of it by putting on the ground some big flat stones which fortunately they discovered not far away. But the evening was not so bad, as the Prussians relaxed their discipline a little now that the captain had disappeared, presumably to some inn. First of all the sentries did not object when some children threw the prisoners some fruit, apples and pears, over their heads. Then they allowed people from round about to come into the camp, and soon there was a crowd of impromptu dealers, men and women, selling bread, wine and even cigars. Everyone who had any money was eating, drinking and smoking. In the fading evening light it looked like the corner of a fair, busy and noisy.","Notwithstanding this terrible lesson Maurice, upon reaching Mouzon, was still possessed by his unalterable determination to attempt an escape. The prisoners were in such an exhausted condition when they reached the place that the Prussians had to assist them to set up the few tents that were placed at their disposal. The camp was formed near the town, on low and marshy ground, and the worst of the business was that another convoy having occupied the spot the day before, the field was absolutely invisible under the superincumbent filth; it was no better than a common cesspool, of unimaginable foulness. The sole means the men had of self-protection was to scatter over the ground some large flat stones, of which they were so fortunate as to find a number in the vicinity. By way of compensation they had a somewhat less hard time of it that evening; the strictness of their guardians was relaxed a little once the captain had disappeared, doubtless to seek the comforts of an inn. The sentries began by winking at the irregularity of the proceeding when some children came along and commenced to toss fruit, apples and pears, over their heads to the prisoners; the next thing was they allowed the people of the neighborhood to enter the lines, so that in a short time the camp was swarming with impromptu merchants, men and women, offering for sale bread, wine, cigars, even. Those who had money had no trouble in supplying their needs so far as eating, drinking, and smoking were concerned. A bustling animation prevailed in the dim twilight; it was like a corner of the market place in a town where a fair is being held."

"Et il avait deviné. Le général Douay, qui voyait l’extrême fatigue des troupes, désespérait de jamais atteindre la Besace, ce jour-là. Mais ce qui le décida surtout, ce fut l’arrivée du convoi, de ce fâcheux convoi qu’il traînait depuis Reims, et dont les trois lieues de voitures et de bêtes alourdissaient si terriblement sa marche. De Quatre-Champs, il avait donné l’ordre de le diriger directement sur Saint-Pierremont ; et c’était seulement à Oches que les attelages ralliaient le corps, dans un tel état d’épuisement, que les chevaux refusaient d’avancer. Il était déjà cinq heures. Le général, craignant de s’engager dans le défilé de Stonne, crut devoir renoncer à achever l’étape indiquée par le maréchal. On s’arrêta, on campa, le convoi en bas, dans les prairies, gardé par une division, tandis que l’artillerie s’établissait en arrière, sur les coteaux, et que la brigade qui devait servir d’arrière-garde le lendemain, restait sur une hauteur, en face de Saint-Pierremont. Une autre division, dont faisait partie la brigade Bourgain-Desfeuilles, bivouaqua, derrière l’église, sur un large plateau, que bordait un bois de chênes.","And he had guessed. General Douay, who saw the extreme fatigue of the troops, despaired of ever reaching La Besace that day. But what decided him above all was the arrival of the convoy, of that unfortunate convoy which he had been dragging from Reims, and whose three leagues of carriages and animals so terribly weighed down his march. From Quatre-Champs he had given the order to direct it directly to Saint-Pierremont; and it was only at Oches that the teams joined the corps, in such a state of exhaustion that the horses refused to advance. It was already five o'clock. The general, fearing to enter the defile of Stonne, thought he had to give up trying to complete the stage indicated by the marshal. We stopped, we encamped, the convoy below, in the meadows, guarded by a division, while the artillery established itself in the rear, on the hillsides, and the brigade which was to serve as the rearguard next day, remained on a height, in front of Saint-Pierremont. Another division, which included the Bourgain-Desfeuilles brigade, bivouacked behind the church on a large plateau bordered by a wood of oaks.","He had guessed right. General Douay, seeing the exhaustion of his troops, gave up hope of ever making La Besace that day. But what settled it for him was the arrival of the supply train, this damned convoy he had been dragging after him ever since Rheims, the three leagues of which – vehicles and animals – so terribly hampered his march. From Quatre-Champs he had ordered it to be sent straight on to Saint-Pierremont, and it was only at Oches that the vehicles rejoined the main body, and in such a state of exhaustion that the horses were refusing to move. It was five o’clock already and fearing to get involved in the gorge of Stonne, the general thought he should give up the idea of finishing the day’s march laid down by the marshal. So they stopped and camped, the baggage down below in the meadows, guarded by one division, while the artillery took up a position behind on the higher ground, and the brigade that was to act as rearguard the next day stayed on a bluff opposite Saint-Pierremont. Another division, of which the Bourgain-Desfeuilles brigade was a part, bivouacked behind the church on a broad plateau flanked by an oak wood.","He had guessed aright; General Douay saw the exhausted condition of the troops, and was convinced that it would be useless to attempt to reach la Besace that day. What particularly influenced his determination, however, was the arrival of the train, that ill-starred train that had been trailing in his rear since they left Rheims, and of which the nine long miles of vehicles and animals had so terribly impeded his movements. He had given instructions from Quatre-Champs to direct it straight on Saint-Pierremont, and it was not until Osches that the teams came up with the corps, in such a state of exhaustion that the horses refused to stir. It was now five o'clock; the general, not liking the prospect of attempting the pass of Stonne at that late hour, determined to take the responsibility of abridging the task assigned them by the marshal. The corps was halted and proceeded to encamp; the train below in the meadows, guarded by a division, while the artillery took position on the hills to the rear, and the brigade detailed to act as rear-guard on the morrow rested on a height facing Saint-Pierremont. The other division, which included Bourgain-Desfeuilles' brigade, bivouacked on a wide plateau, bordered by an oak wood, behind the church."

Mais un arrêt se produisit.","Then Sergeant Sapin, a pinched little man with large, vague eyes, began the roll call. His thin voice threw out the names, while the soldiers who had approached answered in every key, from the cello to the flute. But a halt occurred.","Then Sergeant Sapin, a skinny little man with big cowlike eyes, began roll-call. He snapped out the names in his high-pitched voice, and the soldiers who had gathered round answered on every note from cello to flute. But then there was a hold-up.","Forthwith Sergeant Sapin, a ceremonious little man with large vague eyes, stepped forward and began to call the roll. He rattled off the names in a thin, piping voice, while the men, who had come up and ranged themselves in front of him, responded in accents of varying pitch, from the deep rumble of the violoncello to the shrill note of the piccolo. But there came a hitch in the proceedings."
"– Nous sommes fichus ! dit-il à Jean, pris de désespoir, dans une soudaine et courte lucidité.","- We're finished! he said to Jean, seized with despair, in a sudden and brief lucidity.","‘We’re finished,’ he said to Jean, seized with despair in a sudden brief moment of lucidity.","“It is all up with us!” said he, as the whole truth flashed through his mind, to Jean, who had given way to despair."

Perhaps, all the same, the youth of the wounded man would triumph over the accidents he feared.",Indeed Bouroche had shaken his head and been unable to make any promise as yet. It was still possible that the patient’s youth would bring him through the complications he was afraid of.,"Bouroche, in fact, had shaken his head ominously, saying he could promise nothing as yet. Nevertheless the patient might pull through, in spite of all the evil consequences he feared; he had youth on his side."

"Jean, d’esprit pratique et de peau plus dure, ne songeait qu’à leur sottise, de n’avoir pas emporté chacun un pain. Dans l’effarement de leur départ, ils s’en étaient même allés à jeun ; et la faim, une fois encore, leur cassait les jambes. D’autres prisonniers devaient être dans le même cas, car plusieurs tendaient de l’argent, suppliaient qu’on leur vendît quelque chose. Il y en avait un, très grand, l’air très malade, qui agitait une pièce d’or, l’offrant au bout de son long bras, par-dessus la tête des soldats de l’escorte, avec le désespoir de ne rien trouver à acheter. Et ce fut alors que Jean, qui guettait, aperçut de loin, devant une boulangerie, une douzaine de pains en tas. Tout de suite, avant les autres, il jeta cent sous, voulut prendre deux de ces pains. Puis, comme le Prussien qui se trouvait près de lui, le repoussait brutalement, il s’entêta à ramasser au moins sa pièce. Mais, déjà, le capitaine, auquel la surveillance de la colonne était confiée, un petit chauve, de figure insolente, accourait. Il leva sur Jean la crosse de son revolver, il jura qu’il fendrait la tête au premier qui oserait bouger. Et tous avaient plié les épaules, baissé les yeux, tandis que la marche continuait, avec le sourd roulement des pieds, dans cette soumission frémissante du troupeau.","Jean, of a practical mind and of tougher skin, thought only of their folly, of not having each brought a loaf of bread. In the horror of their departure, they had even gone away on an empty stomach; and hunger, once again, broke their legs. Other prisoners must have been in the same situation, for several were handing out money, begging someone to sell them something. There was one, very tall, looking very ill, waving a gold coin, offering it at the end of his long arm, over the heads of the escorting soldiers, in despair not to find nothing to buy. And it was then that Jean, who was watching, saw from afar, in front of a bakery, a dozen loaves in a heap. Immediately, before the others, he threw down a hundred sous, wanted to take two of these loaves. Then, as the Prussian who was near him pushed him back brutally, he stubbornly persisted in picking up at least his gun. But already the captain, to whom the supervision of the column was entrusted, a little bald man with an insolent face, was running up. He raised the butt of his revolver at Jean, he swore that he would split the head off the first who dared to move. And all had bent their shoulders, lowered their eyes, while the march continued, with the dull rolling of the feet, in this quivering submission of the herd.","Jean, more down-to-earth and more thick-skinned, was only concerned with their silliness in not having brought away a loaf each. In the sudden scurry of their departure they had even left without eating anything, and now once again hunger was tiring them out. Other prisoners must have been in the same state, for many were holding out money and begging to be sold something. One very tall man in particular, who looked terribly ill, was waving a gold coin with his long arm over the heads of the escorting soldiers, and despairing of finding anything to buy. Then it was that Jean, who was certainly on the look-out, spotted in the distance a pile of a dozen loaves in front of a baker’s shop. Quickly, before the others, he threw down five francs and tried to pick up two of the loaves. Then as the Prussian near him brutally shoved him back, he insisted on trying at any rate to recover his money. But already the captain in charge of the column was running up. He was a bald-headed little man with an arrogant face, and he threatened Jean with the butt of his revolver and swore he would crack open the skull of the first man who dared to move. They all lowered their heads and looked down, and the march continued with the thud of feet and the resentful submissiveness of a herd of animals.","Jean, whose epidermis was thicker and mind more practical, thought only of their stupidity in not having brought off with them a loaf of bread apiece. In the hurry of their abrupt departure they had even gone off without breakfasting, and hunger soon made its presence felt by the nerveless sensation in their legs. Others among the prisoners appeared to be in the same boat, for they held out money, begging the people of the place to sell them something to eat. There was one, an extremely tall man, apparently very ill, who displayed a gold piece, extending it above the heads of the soldiers of the escort; and he was almost frantic that he could purchase nothing. Just at that time Jean, who had been keeping his eyes open, perceived a bakery a short distance ahead, before which were piled a dozen loaves of bread; he immediately got his money ready and, as the column passed, tossed the baker a five-franc piece and endeavored to secure two of the loaves; then, when the Prussian who was marching at his side pushed him back roughly into the ranks, he protested, demanding that he be allowed to recover his money from the baker. But at that juncture the captain commanding the detachment, a short, bald-headed man with a brutal expression of face, came hastening up; he raised his revolver over Jean's head as if about to strike him with the butt, declaring with an oath that he would brain the first man that dared to lift a finger. And the rest of the captives continued to shamble on, stirring up the dust of the road with their shuffling feet, with eyes averted and shoulders bowed, cowed and abjectly submissive as a drove of cattle."

"Bien que la pitié fût grande, tous deux ne pouvaient parler de Gutmann sans une sorte de gaieté attendrie. Lorsque la jeune femme était entrée à l’ambulance, le premier jour, elle avait eu le saisissement de reconnaître, dans ce soldat bavarois, l’homme à la barbe et aux cheveux rouges, aux gros yeux bleus, au large nez carré, qui l’avait emportée entre ses bras, à Bazeilles, pendant qu’on fusillait son mari. Lui, également, la reconnut ; mais il ne pouvait parler, une balle, entrée par la nuque, lui avait enlevé la moitié de la langue. Et, après deux jours d’un recul d’horreur, d’un involontaire frisson, chaque fois qu’elle s’approchait de son lit, elle fut conquise par les regards désespérés et très doux dont il la suivait. N’était-ce donc plus le monstre, au poil éclaboussé de sang, aux prunelles chavirées de rage, qui la hantait d’un affreux souvenir ? Il lui fallait un effort pour le retrouver maintenant chez ce malheureux, l’air si bonhomme, si docile, au milieu de ses atroces souffrances. Son cas, peu fréquent, cette infirmité brusque, touchait l’ambulance entière. On n’était même pas bien sûr qu’il se nommât Gutmann, on l’appelait ainsi, parce que l’unique son qu’il arrivait à proférer était un grognement de deux syllabes qui faisait à peu près ce nom. Sur tout le reste, on croyait seulement savoir qu’il était marié et qu’il avait des enfants. Il devait comprendre quelques mots de français, il répondait parfois d’un signe violent de la tête. Marié ? oui, oui ! Des enfants ? oui, oui ! Son attendrissement, un jour, à voir de la farine, avait encore fait supposer qu’il pouvait être meunier. Et rien autre. Où était-il, le moulin ? Dans quel lointain village de la Bavière pleuraient-ils à cette heure, les enfants et la femme ? Allait-il donc mourir, inconnu, sans nom, laissant les siens, là-bas, dans une éternelle attente ?","Although the pity was great, both could not speak of Gutmann without a kind of fond gaiety. When the young woman had entered the ambulance on the first day, she had been shocked to recognize in this Bavarian soldier the man with the beard and red hair, the big blue eyes, the large square nose, who had carried her away in his arms, at Bazeilles, while her husband was being shot. He, too, recognized her; but he could not speak, a bullet, entering through the back of the neck, had taken away half of his tongue. And, after two days of a recoil of horror, of an involuntary shudder, each time she approached his bed, she was conquered by the desperate and very gentle looks with which he followed her. Was it no longer the monster, with blood spattered hair, eyes capsized with rage, who haunted her with a terrible memory? She had to make an effort to find him now in this unfortunate man, who looked so good-natured, so docile, in the midst of his atrocious suffering. His rare case, this sudden infirmity, touched the entire ambulance. We weren't even quite sure that his name was Gutmann, we called him that, because the only sound he could make was a two-syllable growl that went something like that name. Above all else, it was only believed that he was married and had children. He must have understood a few words of French, he sometimes replied with a violent nod of the head. Married ? yes yes ! Children? yes yes ! His tenderness, one day, at seeing flour, had once again led one to suppose that he might be a miller. And nothing else. Where was the mill? In what distant Bavarian village were they crying at this hour, the children and the wife? Was he then going to die, unknown, nameless, leaving his family there, in eternal expectation?","In spite of really great pity, they could not refer to Gutmann without a sort of affectionate flippancy. On the very first day she had gone to work at the hospital she had been horrified to recognize in this Bavarian soldier the man with the red beard and hair, bulging blue eyes and wide, square nose, who had carried her off in his arms at Bazeilles when they shot her husband. He recognized her too, but he could not speak, for a bullet had gone through the back of his neck and taken away half his tongue. After two days of horror and revulsion and an uncontrollable shuddering every time she went near his bed, she was won over by his most desperate and appealing look as he followed her round with his eyes. Was he no longer the monster with bloodstained hair and eyes, mad with frenzy, who haunted her with a terrible memory? It needed an effort to recognize him now in this poor wretch with such a friendly, gentle expression in spite of all his atrocious suffering. His case, an uncommon one involving this sudden incapacity, touched the whole hospital. They were not even quite sure his name was Gutmann, but that is what they called him because the only sound he could manage to get out was a growl in two syllables which made roughly that name. As far as the rest was concerned, they only thought they knew that he was married and had children, because he knew a few words of French and sometimes answered with a vigorous nod. Married? Yes, yes! Children? Yes, yes! His emotion one day when he saw some flour had also made them guess he might be a miller. But that was all. Where was the mill? Were a wife and children weeping at this very moment in some remote village in Bavaria? Was he going to die unknown, nameless, leaving his own folk over there to wait for him for ever?","Although they both felt the deepest compassion for him, they never spoke of Gutman but a smile of gentle amusement came to their lips. Almost immediately upon entering on her duties at the hospital the young woman had been shocked to recognize in that Bavarian soldier the features: big blue eyes, red hair and beard and massive nose, of the man who had carried her away in his arms the day they shot her husband at Bazeilles. He recognized her as well, but could not speak; a musket ball, entering at the back of the neck, had carried away half his tongue. For two days she recoiled with horror, an involuntary shudder passed through her frame, each time she had to approach his bed, but presently her heart began to melt under the imploring, very gentle looks with which he followed her movements in the room. Was he not the blood-splashed monster, with eyes ablaze with furious rage, whose memory was ever present to her mind? It cost her an effort to recognize him now in that submissive, uncomplaining creature, who bore his terrible suffering with such cheerful resignation. The nature of his affliction, which is not of frequent occurrence, enlisted for him the sympathies of the entire hospital. It was not even certain that his name was Gutman; he was called so because the only sound he succeeded in articulating was a word of two syllables that resembled that more than it did anything else. As regarded all other particulars concerning him everyone was in the dark; it was generally believed, however, that he was married and had children. He seemed to understand a few words of French, for he would answer questions that were put to him with an emphatic motion of the head: “Married?” yes, yes! “Children?” yes, yes! The interest and excitement he displayed one day that he saw some flour induced them to believe he might have been a miller. And that was all. Where was the mill, whose wheel had ceased to turn? In what distant Bavarian village were the wife and children now weeping their lost husband and father? Was he to die, nameless, unknown, in that foreign country, and leave his dear ones forever ignorant of his fate?"
"Alors, le cri du capitaine retentit une seconde fois :",Then the captain's cry rang out a second time:,Then the captain’s voice rang out a second time:,Again the captain's ringing voice was heard ordering up the limbers.
"Il était environ sept heures, et il avait trop tardé. Tant qu’il put marcher le long des maisons, il profita des portes, des bouts de muraille, se collant dans les moindres encoignures, à chaque décharge. Jamais il ne se serait cru si jeune ni si agile, tellement il s’allongeait avec des souplesses de couleuvre. Mais, au bout de Bazeilles, lorsqu’il lui fallut suivre pendant près de trois cents mètres la route déserte et nue, que balayaient les batteries du Liry, il se sentit grelotter, bien qu’il fût trempé de sueur. Un moment encore, il s’avança courbé en deux, dans un fossé. Puis, il prit sa course follement, il galopa droit devant lui, les oreilles pleines de détonations, pareilles à des coups de tonnerre. Ses yeux brûlaient, il croyait marcher dans des flammes. Cela dura une éternité. Subitement, il aperçut une petite maison, sur la gauche ; et il se précipita, il s’abrita, la poitrine soulagée d’un poids énorme. Du monde l’entourait, des hommes, des chevaux. D’abord, il n’avait distingué personne. Ensuite, ce qu’il vit l’étonna.","It was about seven o'clock, and he had gone too long. As long as he was able to walk alongside the houses, he took advantage of the doors, of the bits of wall, sticking to the smallest corners, at each discharge. He would never have thought himself so young or so agile, he stretched out with the suppleness of a snake. But, at the end of Bazeilles, when he had to follow for nearly three hundred meters the deserted and bare road swept by the batteries of the Liry, he felt himself shivering, although he was drenched in sweat. For a moment longer he advanced, bent double, into a ditch. Then he raced madly, he galloped straight ahead, his ears full of detonations, like claps of thunder. His eyes were burning, he thought he was walking through flames. It lasted forever. Suddenly he saw a small house on the left; and he rushed forward, he took shelter, his chest relieved of an enormous weight. People surrounded him, men, horses. First, he hadn't singled out anyone. Then what he saw amazed him.","It was now about seven, and he had hung about too long. As long as the houses lasted he took advantage of doorways and bits of wall, squeezing into the tiniest corners at each burst of firing. He would never have believed he was so young and agile as he glided along as lithe as a snake. But at the end of Bazeilles, when he had to negotiate nearly three hundred metres of empty, open road, raked by the batteries at Le Liry, he felt himself shivering although he was soaked in sweat. For one moment he was able to get along bent double in a ditch, but then he had to run for it, madly, straight ahead, his ears full of explosions like peals of thunder. His eyes smarted as though he were walking through fire. It seemed to go on for an eternity. Suddenly he saw a little house on the left, and he leaped for it and shelter, and a huge weight was lifted from him. There were people all round him, men and horses. At first he had not recognized anyone. Then what he saw amazed him.","It was seven o'clock, and he had delayed his departure too long. So long as the houses were there to afford him shelter he took advantage of every doorway, of every bit of projecting wall, shrinking at every volley into cavities that were ridiculously small in comparison with his bulk. He turned and twisted in and out with the sinuous dexterity of the serpent; he would never have supposed that there was so much of his youthful agility left in him. When he reached the end of the village, however, and had to make his way for a space of some three hundred yards along the deserted, empty road, swept by the batteries on Liry hill, although the perspiration was streaming from his face and body, he shivered and his teeth chattered. For a minute or so he advanced cautiously along the bed of a dry ditch, bent almost double, then, suddenly forsaking the protecting shelter, burst into the open and ran for it with might and main, wildly, aimlessly, his ears ringing with detonations that sounded to him like thunder-claps. His eyes burned like coals of fire; it seemed to him that he was wrapt in flame. It was an eternity of torture. Then he suddenly caught sight of a little house to his left, and he rushed for the friendly refuge, gained it, with a sensation as if an immense load had been lifted from his breast. The place was tenanted, there were men and horses there. At first he could distinguish nothing. What he beheld subsequently filled him with amazement."
"Mais l’explication courut d’un bout à l’autre de la colonne. C’était le camp de Châlons qui flambait depuis deux jours, incendié par ordre de l’empereur, pour sauver des mains des Prussiens les richesses entassées. La cavalerie d’arrière-garde avait, disait-on, été chargée de mettre le feu à un grand baraquement, appelé le magasin jaune, plein de tentes, de piquets, de nattes, et au magasin neuf, un immense hangar fermé, où s’empilaient des gamelles, des souliers, des couvertures, de quoi équiper cent autres mille hommes. Des meules de fourrage, allumées elles aussi, fumaient comme des torches gigantesques. Et, à ce spectacle, devant ces tourbillons livides qui débordaient des collines lointaines, emplissant le ciel d’un irréparable deuil, l’armée, en marche par la grande plaine triste, était tombée dans un lourd silence. Sous le soleil, on n’entendait plus que la cadence des pas, tandis que les têtes, malgré elles, se tournaient toujours vers les fumées grossissantes, dont la nuée de désastre sembla suivre la colonne pendant toute une lieue encore.","But the explanation ran from one end of the column to the other. It was the camp of Châlons, which had been on fire for two days, set on fire by order of the Emperor, to save the treasures heaped up from the hands of the Prussians. The rear-guard cavalry had, it was said, been instructed to set fire to a large barracks, called the yellow store, full of tents, pickets, mats, and to the new store, a huge closed shed, where there were piles of bowls, shoes, blankets, enough to equip another hundred thousand men. Haystacks, also lit, smoked like gigantic torches. And, at this spectacle, before these livid whirlwinds which overflowed from the distant hills, filling the sky with irreparable mourning, the army, marching across the great sad plain, had fallen into a heavy silence. Under the sun, only the cadence of footsteps could be heard, while heads, in spite of themselves, were still turned towards the swelling smoke, whose cloud of disaster seemed to follow the column for a whole league yet.","The explanation ran from end to end of the column. It was the Châlons camp which had been blazing for two days, set on fire by the Emperor’s order to prevent hoards of supplies falling into Prussian hands. The rearguard cavalry, it was said, had been ordered to set fire to a great warehouse called the yellow store, full of tents, tent-pegs, matting beds, and to the new store, a huge enclosed shed in which were piles of messtins, boots, blankets, enough to equip another hundred thousand men. Stacks of forage, also fired, were burning like giant torches. At this sight, witnessing these livid, swirling clouds rolling over the distant hills and filling the sky with mourning for the irreplaceable, the army marching across the dreary plain fell into a sullen silence. Under the sun no sound could be heard except the beat of their steps, but heads were turned willy-nilly towards the ever spreading smoke which, like a doom-laden cloud, seemed to be following the column for yet another league.","The answer was quickly given and ran through the column from front to rear. The camp of Chalons had been fired, it was said, by order of the Emperor, to keep the immense collection of stores there from falling into the hands of the Prussians, and for the last two days it had been going up in flame and smoke. The cavalry of the rear-guard had been instructed to apply the torch to two immense warehouses, filled with tents, tent-poles, mattresses, clothing, shoes, blankets, mess utensils, supplies of every kind sufficient for the equipment of a hundred thousand men. Stacks of forage also had been lighted, and were blazing like huge beacon-fires, and an oppressive silence settled down upon the army as it pursued its march across the wide, solitary plain at sight of that dusky, eddying column that rose from behind the distant hills, filling the heavens with desolation. All that was to be heard in the bright sunlight was the measured tramp of many feet upon the hollow ground, while involuntarily the eyes of all were turned on that livid cloud whose baleful shadows rested on their march for many a league."
"Et il ne trouvait plus les mots, la bouche empâtée de fatigue ; et, tout d’un coup, il s’abattit à son tour, foudroyé par le sommeil.","And he couldn't find the words, his mouth thick with fatigue; and all of a sudden he fell down in his turn, overwhelmed with sleep.","He couldn’t find his words, for his mouth was clogged by fatigue, and suddenly he went over as well, knocked out by sleep.","And that was as far as he could proceed, for fatigue sealed his lips, and like the rest he suddenly sank down and was lost in slumber."
"– Ça ne peut pas durer, vous vous fichez de nous… Je suis venu moi-même pour vous avertir que, si le cas se reproduit, je vous en rendrai responsable, oui ! je saurai prendre des mesures !","– This can't last, you don't care about us… I came myself to warn you that, if the case happens again, I will hold you responsible, yes! I can take action!","‘This can’t go on any longer, what do you take us for? … So I’ve come myself to warn you that if this happens again I shall hold you responsible. Yes, I shall know what steps to take!’","“Things can't go on in this way; you are not dealing squarely by us. I came myself to give you warning, once for all, that if the thing happens again I shall take other steps to remedy it; and I promise you the consequences will not be agreeable.”"
"C’était la révolte du moi, l’enragement égoïste de l’individu qui ne veut pas se sacrifier pour l’espèce et finir.","It was the revolt of the self, the selfish enrage of the individual who does not want to sacrifice himself for the species and end.","It was the revolt of the self, the self-centred rage of the individual unwilling to sacrifice himself for mankind and cease to be.","It was the revolt of the individual Ego, the unaltruistic refusal of the one to make himself a sacrifice for the benefit of the species."
"– Écoutez, je n’ai pas voulu vous faire de la peine tout à l’heure, mais je crois bien qu’Honoré est resté là-bas.","“Listen, I didn’t want to upset you just now, but I really believe that Honoré stayed over there.","‘Look, I didn’t want to upset you just now, but I believe Honoré is still out there.’","“See here, I did not wish to grieve you just now, but I don't believe Honore will ever come back.”"
"– Les Prussiens, oh ! oui, oui, je les ai vus.","“The Prussians, oh! yes, yes, I saw them.","‘The Prussians, oh yes, yes, I saw them!’","“The Prussians— Oh! yes, yes, I saw them.”"
"Fouchard entretenait ainsi de bonnes relations avec les francs-tireurs des bois de Dieulet, qui, depuis bientôt trois mois, sortaient au crépuscule de leurs taillis impénétrables, rôdaient par les routes, tuaient et dévalisaient les Prussiens qu’ils pouvaient surprendre, se rabattaient sur les fermes, rançonnaient les paysans, quand le gibier ennemi venait à manquer. Ils étaient la terreur des villages, d’autant plus qu’à chaque convoi attaqué, à chaque sentinelle égorgée, les autorités allemandes se vengeaient sur les bourgs voisins, qu’ils accusaient de connivence, les frappant d’amendes, emmenant les maires prisonniers, brûlant les chaumières. Et, si les paysans, malgré la bonne envie qu’ils en avaient, ne livraient pas Sambuc et sa bande, c’était simplement par crainte de recevoir quelque balle, au détour d’un sentier, dans le cas où le coup n’aurait pas réussi.","Fouchard thus maintained good relations with the francs-tireurs of the Bois de Dieulet, who for almost three months had been emerging at dusk from their impenetrable thickets, prowling the roads, killing and robbing the Prussians they could surprise, falling back on the farms, ransomed the peasants, when the enemy game ran out. They were the terror of the villages, especially since with each convoy attacked, with each sentry slaughtered, the German authorities took revenge on the neighboring towns, which they accused of connivance, hitting them with fines, taking the mayors prisoners , burning the cottages. And, if the peasants, in spite of the good desire they had for it, did not hand over Sambuc and his band, it was simply for fear of receiving some bullet, at the bend of a path, in the event that the shot did not would not have succeeded.","Fouchard kept on good terms with the guerrillas of Dieulet woods, who for nearly three months had been emerging from their impenetrable thickets at dusk and prowling on the roads, killing and robbing any Prussians they could surprise, and falling back on the farms and extorting money from the peasants when enemy game was scarce. They were the terror of the villages, particularly because after every attack on a convoy or killing of a sentry the German authorities took reprisals on places in the district, accusing them of aiding and abetting, levying fines, imprisoning mayors, burning cottages. Much as they would have liked to, the peasants did not betray Sambuc and his band simply out of fear of stopping a bullet round some corner if the deal misfired.","Fouchard maintained amicable relations with these francs-tireurs from Dieulet wood, who for some three months past had been emerging at nightfall from the fastnesses where they made their lurking place, killing and robbing a Prussian whenever they could steal upon him unawares, descending on the farms and plundering the peasants when there was a scarcity of the other kind of game. They were the terror of all the villages in the vicinity, and the more so that every time a provision train was attacked or a sentry murdered the German authorities avenged themselves on the adjacent hamlets, the inhabitants of which they accused of abetting the outrages, inflicting heavy penalties on them, carrying off their mayors as prisoners, burning their poor hovels. Nothing would have pleased the peasants more than to deliver Sambuc and his band to the enemy, and they were only deterred from doing so by their fear of being shot in the back at a turn in the road some night should their attempt fail of success."
"– Tenez ! monsieur, dans celle qui est là devant nous… Vous ne voyez pas la maison, elle est derrière ce grand mur que des arbres dépassent.","- Hold ! sir, in the one in front of us... You can't see the house, it's behind this big wall with trees sticking out.","‘Tell me, isn’t it in one of these houses that the Emperor is staying?’ ‘Yes, look, sir, the one straight in front of you. You can’t see the house itself, it’s behind that high wall with the trees hiding it.’","“There, monsieur, in that one right before you. Only you can't see it, for it is concealed by the high wall with the overhanging trees.”"
"Le père Fouchard avait repris la chandelle. Sans doute, il le reconnut. Mais il s’obstinait, dans sa volonté de ne pas même donner un verre d’eau.","Father Fouchard had taken up the candle again.

But he persisted in his determination not to give away even a glass of water.,"Father Fouchard took up his candle. He recognized his nephew, beyond a doubt, but was firm in his resolve not to give so much as a glass of water."

"Sur son grand cheval, le colonel de Vineuil avait tourné la tête. Et il eut un sourire, le seul depuis le matin. Puis, il retomba dans son immobilité, toujours impassible sous les obus, attendant des ordres.","On his high horse, Colonel de Vineuil had turned his head. And he smiled, the only one since morning. Then he fell back into his immobility, still impassive under the shells, waiting for orders.","Colonel de Vineuil, riding by on his tall horse, turned his head, and he smiled for the only time since the early morning. Then he relapsed into his immobility, always unmoved under fire, waiting for orders.","Colonel de Vineuil, sitting his tall horse, turned his head and gave a smile, the first that had been seen on his face that morning. Then he resumed his statue-like attitude, waiting for orders as impassively as ever under the tumbling shells."
"– Oh ! non, monsieur, ce n’est pas possible. Le médecin a bien dit que je le tuerais… Si encore son pauvre père était en vie ! Mais nous ne sommes plus que tous les deux, il faut que nous nous conservions l’un pour l’autre… Et puis, ces Prussiens, ils ne vont peut-être pas faire du mal à une femme seule et à un enfant malade.","- Oh ! no, sir, it is not possible. The doctor said that I would kill him… If his poor father were still alive! But we are no longer just the two of us, we have to save ourselves for each other... And then, these Prussians, they may not hurt a lonely woman and a sick child.","‘Oh no, sir, it isn’t possible. The doctor said I would kill him… If only his poor father were still alive! But there are only the two of us now and we must save ourselves for each other… And besides, those Prussians surely won’t do any harm to a woman on her own and a sick child!’","“Oh, no, sir, I cannot. The doctor told me it would kill him. If only his poor father were alive! but we two are all that are left, and we must live for each other. And then, perhaps the Prussians will be merciful; perhaps they won't harm a lone woman and a sick boy.”"
"Derrière la haie, tranquillement, ils s’arrêtèrent une minute. Mais l’eau-de-vie, au lieu de les désaltérer, leur brûlait l’estomac. C’était exaspérant, ce goût de roussi dans la bouche. Et ils se mouraient aussi d’inanition, ils auraient volontiers mordu à la moitié de pain que Maurice avait dans son sac ; seulement, était-ce possible ? Derrière eux, le long de la haie, d’autres hommes arrivaient sans cesse, qui les poussaient. Enfin, d’un bond, ils franchirent la dernière pente. Ils étaient sur le plateau, au pied même du calvaire, la vieille croix rongée par les vents et la pluie, entre deux maigres tilleuls.","Behind the hedge, quietly, they stopped for a minute. But the brandy, instead of quenching their thirst, burned their stomachs. It was infuriating, that scorched taste in your mouth. And they were also dying of starvation, they would gladly have bitten off half the bread that Maurice had in his bag; only, was it possible? Behind them, along the hedge, other men kept coming, pushing them. Finally, with a bound, they crossed the last slope. They were on the plateau, at the very foot of the Calvary, the old cross eaten away by the winds and the rain, between two thin lime trees.","They coolly stopped there for a moment, behind the hedge. But far from quenching their thirst the brandy burned their insides. It was the limit, this taste of scorching in their mouths. And they were dying of hunger too. They would have liked to take a bite at the half loaf Maurice had in his pack, only how could it be done? All along the hedge behind them other men were constantly coming up and pushing into them. At last they dashed with one bound across the last slope and were on the plateau at the foot of the Calvary, the old cross weatherbeaten by wind and rain between two scraggy lime trees.","And they paused behind the hedge a moment and raised the flask to their lips, but the brandy, instead of relieving their thirst, burned their stomach. It irritated them, that nasty taste of burnt rags in their mouths. Moreover they perceived that their strength was commencing to fail for want of sustenance and would have liked to take a bite from the half loaf that Maurice had in his knapsack, but it would not do to stop and breakfast there under fire, and then they had to keep up with their comrades. There was a steady stream of men coming up behind them along the hedge who pressed them forward, and so, doggedly bending their backs to the task before them, they resumed their course. Presently they made their final rush and reached the crest. They were on the plateau, at the very foot of the Calvary, the old weather-beaten cross that stood between two stunted lindens."
"Le major acheva de le mettre hors de lui, en ajoutant que des officiers qu’il venait de voir, à l’hôtel de l’Europe, parlaient d’une sortie en masse, avant le jour. Depuis que les exigences allemandes étaient connues, une surexcitation extrême se déclarait, on risquait les projets les plus extravagants. L’idée même qu’il ne serait pas loyal de profiter des ténèbres pour rompre la trêve, sans avertissement aucun, n’arrêtait personne ; et c’étaient des plans fous, la marche reprise sur Carignan, au travers des Bavarois, grâce à la nuit noire, le plateau d’Illy reconquis, par une surprise, la route de Mézières débloquée, ou encore un élan irrésistible, pour se jeter d’un saut en Belgique. D’autres, à la vérité, ne disaient rien, sentaient la fatalité du désastre, auraient tout accepté, tout signé, pour en finir, dans un cri heureux de soulagement.","The Major completed his bewilderment by adding that the officers he had just seen at the Hotel de l'Europe were talking of a mass sortie before daybreak. Ever since the German demands became known, an extreme over-excitement broke out, and the most extravagant projects were risked. The very idea that it would be unfair to take advantage of the darkness to break the truce, without any warning, stopped anyone; and these were crazy plans, the march resumed on Carignan, through the Bavarians, thanks to the dark night, the plateau of Illy reconquered, by a surprise, the road to Mézières unblocked, or even an irresistible dash, to throw a jump in Belgium. Others, in truth, said nothing, sensed the inevitability of the disaster, would have accepted everything, signed everything, to put an end to it, in a happy cry of relief.","The major put the finishing touch to his panic when he added that some officers he had seen at the Hôtel de l’Europe were talking of a mass break-out before daybreak. Since the German demands had become known emotion had risen to fever-pitch, and the most extravagant projects were being put forward. Even the idea that it would not be honest to take advantage of the darkness and violate the truce stopped nobody, and the most crazy plans were bandied about – resumption of the march on Carignan right through the Bavarians, under cover of darkness, the plateau of Illy recaptured by surprise, the Mézières road cleared, or again an irrestible dash to leap with one bound into Belgium. Others, it was true, said nothing, for they were conscious of the inevitability of the disaster and, with a happy cry of relief, would have accepted anything, signed anything so as to be done with it. ‘","The major gave him still further food for anxiety by adding that some officers whom he had met at the Hotel de l'Europe were talking of making a sortie en masse just before daylight. An extremely excited state of feeling had prevailed since the tenor of the German demands had become known, and measures the most extravagant were proposed and discussed. No one seemed to be deterred by the consideration that it would be dishonorable to break the truce, taking advantage of the darkness and giving the enemy no notification, and the wildest, most visionary schemes were offered; they would resume the march on Carignan, hewing their way through the Bavarians, which they could do in the black night; they would recapture the plateau of Illy by a surprise; they would raise the blockade of the Mezieres road, or, by a determined, simultaneous rush, would force the German lines and throw themselves into Belgium. Others there were, indeed, who, feeling the hopelessness of their position, said nothing; they would have accepted any terms, signed any paper, with a glad cry of relief, simply to have the affair ended and done with."
"Puis, un instant, il l’écouta s’irriter contre le gouvernement, contre l’armée, rappeler tout ce qu’on avait souffert, expliquer qu’on allait enfin être les maîtres, punir les incapables et les lâches, sauver la République. Et, à mesure qu’il s’efforçait de le comprendre, sa calme figure de paysan illettré s’assombrissait d’un chagrin croissant.","Then, for a moment, he listened to her grow angry with the government, with the army, recall all that we had suffered, explain that we were finally going to be the masters, punish the incapable and the cowardly, save the Republic . And as he struggled to understand it, his calm face of an illiterate peasant darkened with increasing grief.","For a few minutes he listened while Maurice worked himself up against the government and against the army, recalling all that the people had gone through, explaining that at last they were going to be the masters, punish the incompetent and the cowards and save the Republic. As he strove to follow all this Jean’s calm face, the face of an unlettered peasant, darkened with growing distress.","I don't understand.” Then for a moment he listened while Maurice railed against the government, against the army, raking up old sores and recalling all their sufferings, telling how at last they were going to be masters, punish dolts and cowards and preserve the Republic. And as he struggled to get the problems the other laid before him through his brain, the tranquil face of the unlettered peasant was clouded with an increasing sorrow."

"– C’est bon, répondit Jean, de sa voix tranquille, faites-vous empoigner, je m’en fiche.","“It’s okay,” replied Jean, in his calm voice, “get caught, I don’t care.","‘All right,’ Jean quietly answered, ‘get yourself run in , it’s all the same to me.’","“Very well,” Jean tranquilly replied; “don't blame me if your friend finds his way to the guardhouse.”"
"Puis, comme Jean le regardait, il ajouta avec une tranquille certitude, les yeux au loin dans l’ombre :","Then, as Jean looked at him, he added with quiet certainty, his eyes far away in the shadows:","As Jean looked at him he added with quiet certainty, gazing far away into the darkness:","Then, as he saw Jean looking at him inquiringly, he added with calm conviction, his eyes bent upon the blackness of the night, as if reading there the destiny that he predicted:"
"– La maîtresse du Prussien… Ah ! non, par exemple ! Il est affreux, il me répugne… Pour qui me prend-on ? comment peut-on me croire capable d’une pareille infamie ? Non, non, jamais ! j’aimerais mieux mourir !","“The Prussian’s mistress… Ah! no, for example! He's awful, he's repugnant to me… Who do they take me for? how can anyone believe me capable of such infamy? No, no, never! I would rather die!","‘Mistress of that Prussian… Oh no, the very idea of such a thing! He’s horrible and gives me the creeps … What do they take me for? How could anyone think me capable of such infamy! No, no, never! I’d rather die!’","“ The Prussian my lover? No, thank you! He's detestable; I can't endure him. I wonder what they take me for? What have I ever done that they should suppose I could be guilty of such baseness? No, never! I would rather die than do such a thing!”"

"Mais il y eut un grognement de surprise goguenarde. C’était Jean, le caporal, qui, accompagné de Maurice, revenait de la distribution, avec du bois à brûler. Enfin, on distribuait le bois, que les troupes avaient vainement attendu la veille, pour cuire la soupe. Douze heures de retard seulement.","But there was a growl of mocking surprise. It was Jean, the corporal, who, accompanied by Maurice, was returning from the distribution with some firewood. Finally, they distributed the wood, which the troops had waited in vain the day before, to cook the soup. Only twelve hours late.","But then a growl of surprise and jeering went up as Jean, the corporal, accompanied by Maurice, came back from the ration issue with some firewood. At last they were handing out the wood that the troops had waited for in vain last night to warm up the stew. Only twelve hours late.","But there arose a murmur of pleased surprise. It was occasioned by Jean, the corporal, coming back from the commissary's, accompanied by Maurice, with a load of firewood.

"C’était le cri que Jean, si dur au mal et si muet, ne pouvait plus retenir, qu’il jetait malgré lui, dans le délire de sa faim, n’ayant rien mangé depuis près de trente-six heures. Alors, Maurice se décida, en voyant que, de deux ou trois heures peut-être, leur régiment ne passerait pas la Meuse.","It was the cry that Jean, so hard on pain and so mute, could no longer restrain, that he uttered in spite of himself, in the delirium of his hunger, having eaten nothing for nearly thirty-six hours. Then Maurice made up his mind, seeing that for two or three hours perhaps their regiment would not cross the Meuse.","This was the cry that Jean, usually so tough and so silent, could not hold in any longer, but let out in spite of himself in the delirium of hunger, having had nothing to eat for nearly thirty-six hours.

"Tout de suite, il fut un peu rassuré. Le combat avait lieu par-dessus la ville, les batteries allemandes de la Marfée et de Frénois allaient, au delà des maisons, balayer le plateau de l’Algérie ; et il s’intéressa même au vol des obus, à la courbe immense de légère fumée qu’ils laissaient sur Sedan, pareils à des oiseaux invisibles au fin sillage de plumes grises. Il lui parut d’abord évident que les quelques obus qui avaient crevé des toitures, autour de lui, étaient des projectiles égarés. On ne bombardait pas encore la ville. Puis, en regardant mieux, il crut comprendre qu’ils devaient être des réponses aux rares coups tirés par les canons de la place. Il se tourna, examina, vers le nord, la citadelle, tout cet amas compliqué et formidable de fortifications, les pans de murailles noirâtres, les plaques vertes des glacis, un pullulement géométrique de bastions, surtout les trois cornes géantes, celles des Écossais, du Grand Jardin et de la Rochette, aux angles menaçants ; et c’était ensuite, comme un prolongement cyclopéen, du côté de l’ouest, le fort de Nassau, que suivait le fort du Palatinat, au-dessus du faubourg du Ménil. Il en eut à la fois une impression mélancolique d’énormité et d’enfantillage. À quoi bon, maintenant, avec ces canons, dont les projectiles volaient si aisément d’un bout du ciel à l’autre ? La place, d’ailleurs, n’était pas armée, n’avait ni les pièces nécessaires, ni les munitions, ni les hommes. Depuis trois semaines à peine, le gouverneur avait organisé une garde nationale, des citoyens de bonne volonté, qui devaient servir les quelques pièces en état. Et c’était ainsi qu’au Palatinat trois canons tiraient, tandis qu’il y en avait bien une demi-douzaine à la porte de Paris. Seulement, on n’avait que sept ou huit gargousses à brûler par pièce, on ménageait les coups, on n’en lâchait qu’un par demi-heure, et pour l’honneur simplement, car les obus ne portaient pas, tombaient dans les prairies, en face. Aussi, dédaigneuses, les batteries ennemies ne répondaient-elles que de loin en loin, comme par charité.","Immediately, he was a little reassured. The battle was taking place above the town, the German batteries of La Marfée and Frénois went, beyond the houses, to sweep the plateau of Algeria; and he was even interested in the flight of the shells, in the immense curve of light smoke which they left over Sedan, like invisible birds with a fine trail of gray feathers. At first it seemed obvious to him that the few shells which had burst the roofs around him were stray projectiles. We weren't bombing the city yet. Then, looking better, he thought he understood that they must be responses to the rare shots fired by the cannons in the square. He turned, examined the citadel to the north, all that complicated and formidable mass of fortifications, the blackish sections of walls, the green slabs of the glacis, a geometric proliferation of bastions, especially the three giant horns, those of the Scots, the Grand Jardin and La Rochette, with threatening angles; and then, like a cyclopean prolongation, on the western side, the fort of Nassau, followed by the fort of the Palatinate, above the Faubourg du Ménil. He had a melancholy impression of enormity and childishness at the same time. What was the use now of these guns, whose projectiles flew so easily from one end of the sky to the other? The place, moreover, was not armed, had neither the necessary guns, nor ammunition, nor men. Barely three weeks ago, the governor had organized a national guard, citizens of goodwill, who were to serve the few pieces that were in good condition. And so it was that in the Palatinate three guns fired, while there were half a dozen at the Porte de Paris. Only, we only had seven or eight canisters to burn per gun, we sparing our blows, we only let one go every half hour, and simply for honor, because the shells didn't hit, fell in the meadows opposite. Also, disdainful, the enemy batteries only responded from time to time, as if out of charity.","He was at once reassured, for they were firing right over the town and the German batteries on La Marfée and Frénois were aiming beyond the built-up area so as to rake the plateau of Algérie. He even found the flight of the shells interesting – the immense curve of light smoke they left above Sedan, like invisible birds leaving trails of grey feathers. To begin with it seemed clear that the few shells that had smashed roofs round him had been strays. They were not yet bombarding the town. But on a more careful examination he felt that they must be in reply to the odd shots fired from the fort. So he turned round and studied the citadel to the north, a complicated and formidable system of fortifications, blackened walls, green panels of glacis, innumerable geometrical bastions and topping all the three gigantic hornworks, that of the Ecossais and the Grand Jardin and La Rochette, with menacing angles; and further west, like a Cyclopean projection, the Nassau fort, followed by the Palatinate fort, towering above the Ménil district. The impression they made on him was a melancholy one of enormity and childishness. What was the point of it now, with these guns whose projectiles flew so easily from one end of the sky to the other? In any case the fortress was unarmed, with neither the necessary pieces of artillery nor the ammunition nor the men. For the past three weeks, or barely as long as that, the governor had been organizing a National Guard of citizens willing to man the few guns in working order. That was why three cannon were firing from the Palatinate while a good half dozen were at the Paris gate. But there were only seven or eight rounds available per gun, and so they spaced out the shots, letting one off every half hour and only for honour’s sake at that , for the shells went no distance, but fell in the fields opposite. So the enemy batteries contemptuously sent an occasional answer back, out of charity.","The consequences would be dreadful if they should shell Sedan; he made his way back to the Rue Maqua on a keen run, and was seized by such an imperious desire to learn the truth that he did not pause below stairs, but hurried to the roof, where there was a terrace that commanded a view of the city and its environs. A glance of the situation served to reassure him; the German fire was not directed against the city; the batteries at Frenois and la Marfee were shelling the Plateau de l'Algerie over the roofs of the houses, and now that his alarm had subsided he could even watch with a certain degree of admiration the flight of the projectiles as they sailed over Sedan in a wide, majestic curve, leaving behind them a faint trail of smoke upon the air, like gigantic birds, invisible to mortal eye and to be traced only by the gray plumage shed by their pinions. At first it seemed to him quite evident that what damage had been done so far was the result of random practice by the Prussian gunners: they were not bombarding the city yet; then, upon further consideration, he was of opinion that their firing was intended as a response to the ineffectual fire of the few guns mounted on the fortifications of the place. Turning to the north he looked down from his position upon the extended and complex system of defenses of the citadel, the frowning curtains black with age, the green expanses of the turfed glacis, the stern bastions that reared their heads at geometrically accurate angles, prominent among them the three cyclopean salients, the Ecossais, the Grand Jardin, and la Rochette, while further to the west, in extension of the line, were Fort Nassau and Fort Palatinat, above the faubourg of Menil. The sight produced in him a melancholy impression of immensity and futility. Of what avail were they now against the powerful modern guns with their immense range? Besides, the works were not manned; cannon, ammunition, men were wanting. Some three weeks previously the governor had invited the citizens to organize and form a National Guard, and these volunteers were now doing duty as gunners; and thus it was that there were three guns in service at Palatinat, while at the Porte de Paris there may have been a half dozen. As they had only seven or eight rounds to each gun, however, the men husbanded their ammunition, limiting themselves to a shot every half hour, and that only as a sort of salve to their self-respect, for none of their missiles reached the enemy; all were lost in the meadows opposite them. Hence the enemy's batteries, disdainful of such small game, contemptuously pitched a shell at them from time to time, out of charity, as it were."

"Le docteur, justement, passait aux nouvelles de Paris, qui étaient désastreuses. Il fit remarquer que le journal portait la date du 5 novembre. La reddition de Metz était du 27 octobre, et la nouvelle n’en avait été connue à Paris que le 30. Après les échecs subis déjà à Chevilly, à Bagneux, à la Malmaison, après le combat et la perte du Bourget, cette nouvelle avait éclaté en coup de foudre, au milieu de la population désespérée, irritée de la faiblesse et de l’impuissance du gouvernement de la Défense nationale. Aussi, le lendemain, le 31 octobre, toute une insurrection avait-elle grondé, une foule immense s’étouffant sur la place de l’Hôtel-de-Ville, envahissant les salles, retenant prisonniers les membres du gouvernement, que la garde nationale avait enfin délivrés, dans la crainte de voir triompher les révolutionnaires qui réclamaient la Commune. Et le journal belge ajoutait les réflexions les plus insultantes pour le grand Paris, que la guerre civile déchirait, au moment où l’ennemi était aux portes. N’était-ce pas la décomposition finale, la flaque de boue et de sang où allait s’effondrer un monde ?","The doctor was just passing on the news from Paris, which was disastrous.

Also, the next day, October 31, a whole insurrection had rumbled, an immense crowd choking on the square of the Hôtel-de-Ville, invading the halls, holding the members of the government prisoner, that the national guard had finally delivered, in fear of seeing the revolutionaries who demanded the Commune triumph. And the Belgian newspaper added the most insulting reflections for the greater Paris, which the civil war was tearing apart, at the moment when the enemy was at the gates. Wasn't this the final decomposition, the puddle of mud and blood where a world would crumble?","The doctor passed on to the Paris news, which was disastrous.

And so on the next day, 31 October, a full-scale insurrection had taken place, with an immense crowd packing the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville, bursting into the debating chambers, taking prisoner members of the government who were later rescued by the National Guard because they feared the triumph of the revolutionaries who were demanding a Commune. The Belgian paper went on to make the most insulting reflections about this wonderful Paris, tearing itself to pieces with civil war as soon as the enemy was at the gates. Was this not the final dissolution, the morass of mud and blood into which a world was about to collapse?","The doctor was just coming to the news from Paris, which was of a disastrous character.

Coming, as it did, upon the heels of the reverses recently sustained at Chevilly, Bagneux and la Malmaison, after the conflict at Bourget and the loss of that position, the intelligence had burst like a thunderbolt over the desperate populace, angered and disgusted by the feebleness and impotency of the government of National Defense. And thus it was that on the following day, the 31st, the city was threatened with a general insurrection, an immense throng of angry men, a mob ripe for mischief, collecting on the Place de l'Hotel de Ville , whence they swarmed into the halls and public offices, making prisoners the members of the Government, whom the National Guard rescued later in the day only because they feared the triumph of those incendiaries who were clamoring for the commune. And the Belgian journal wound up with a few stinging comments on the great City of Paris, thus torn by civil war when the enemy was at its gates. Was it not the presage of approaching decomposition, the puddle of blood and mire that was to engulf a world?"

"Les yeux élargis dans sa face pâle, Silvine s’était levée.

"Plus rien n’existait que sa rage, cette fureur inextinguible de la lutte, à l’idée que l’étranger entrerait chez lui, s’assoirait sur sa chaise, boirait dans son verre. Cela soulevait tout son être, emportait son existence accoutumée, sa femme, ses affaires, sa prudence de petit bourgeois raisonnable. Et il s’enferma dans sa maison, s’y barricada, y tourna comme une bête en cage, passant d’une pièce dans une autre, s’assurant que toutes les ouvertures étaient bien bouchées. Il compta ses cartouches, il en avait encore une quarantaine. Puis, comme il allait donner un dernier coup d’œil vers la Meuse, pour s’assurer qu’aucune attaque n’était à craindre par les prairies, la vue des coteaux de la rive gauche l’arrêta de nouveau un instant. Des envolements de fumée indiquaient nettement les positions des batteries prussiennes. Et, dominant la formidable batterie de Frénois, à l’angle d’un petit bois de la Marfée, il retrouva le groupe d’uniformes, plus nombreux, d’un tel éclat au grand soleil, qu’en mettant son binocle par-dessus ses lunettes, il distinguait l’or des épaulettes et des casques.","Nothing existed except his rage, that inextinguishable fury of the struggle, at the idea that the stranger would come into his house, sit down in his chair, drink from his glass. It upset his whole being, carried away his accustomed existence, his wife, his business, his reasonable petty bourgeois prudence. And he locked himself in his house, barricaded himself there, turned around like a caged animal, going from one room to another, making sure that all the openings were well sealed. He counted his cartridges, he still had about forty. Then, as he was about to cast a last glance towards the Meuse, to assure himself that no attack was to be feared from the meadows, the sight of the hills of the left bank stopped him again for a moment. Puffs of smoke clearly indicated the positions of the Prussian batteries. And, dominating the formidable battery of Frénois, at the corner of a small wood of Marfée, he found the group of uniforms, more numerous, of such brilliance in the bright sun, than by putting on his binoculars. over his glasses he could make out the gold of the epaulets and the helmets.","Nothing else now existed but his rage, the inextinguishable fury of the conflict when he thought that the foreigner might enter his home, sit on his chair, drink out of his glass.

He shut and barricaded himself in his house, and there he roamed round and round like a caged beast, going from room to room making sure that all openings were blocked. He counted his ammunition, he had about forty rounds left. Then, as he was going to have a last look towards the Meuse to make sure that there was no attack to fear from the meadows, his eye was caught once again by the range of hills on the left bank. Puffs of smoke clearly indicated the positions of the Prussian batteries. Once again he saw, dominating the formidable batteries of Frénois, at the angle of the little wood on La Marfée, the group of uniforms, this time more of them and looking so brilliant in the bright sunshine that by putting his folding glasses over his spectacles he could see the gold of epaulettes and helmets.","Wrath filled his mind to the exclusion of all else, a wild, fierce desire to fight, to kill, at the thought that the hated foreigner should enter his house, sit in his chair, drink from his glass. It wrought a change in all his nature; everything that went to make up his daily life—wife, business, the methodical prudence of the small bourgeois—seemed suddenly to become unstable and drift away from him. And he shut himself up in his house and barricaded it, he paced the empty apartments with the restless impatience of a caged wild beast, going from room to room to make sure that all the doors and windows were securely fastened. He counted his cartridges and found he had forty left, then, as he was about to give a final look to the meadows to see whether any attack was to be apprehended from that quarter, the sight of the hills on the left bank arrested his attention for a moment. The smoke-wreaths indicated distinctly the position of the Prussian batteries, and at the corner of a little wood on la Marfee, over the powerful battery at Frenois, he again beheld the group of uniforms, more numerous than before, and so distinct in the bright sunlight that by supplementing his spectacles with his binocle he could make out the gold of their epaulettes and helmets."
"– Cochons, les Prussiens !","– Pigs, the Prussians!",‘Prussian swine!’,"“Dey're loafers, de Prussians!”"
"Un moment, ce fut du désespoir. Eh quoi ! on marchait depuis le matin sans manger, on venait encore de se tirer, à force de jambes, du terrible défilé d’Haraucourt, tout cela pour buter, dans ce désarroi, dans cet effarement, contre un mur infranchissable ! Avant des heures peut-être, le tour des derniers venus n’arriverait pas ; et chacun sentait bien que, si les Prussiens n’osaient continuer de nuit leur poursuite, ils seraient là dès la pointe du jour. Pourtant, l’ordre de former les faisceaux fut donné, on campa sur les vastes coteaux nus dont les pentes, longées par la route de Mouzon, descendent jusqu’aux prairies de la Meuse. En arrière, couronnant un plateau, l’artillerie de réserve s’établit en bataille, braqua ses pièces vers le défilé, pour en battre la sortie, au besoin. Et, de nouveau, l’attente commença, pleine de révolte et d’angoisse.","For a moment, it was despair. Oh what! they had been walking since morning without eating, they had just dragged themselves out of the terrible defile of Haraucourt, all this to stumble, in this disarray, in this bewilderment, against an impassable wall! Before hours perhaps, the turn of the last comers would not arrive; and everyone felt that, if the Prussians did not dare to continue their pursuit by night, they would be there at daybreak. However, the order to form the beams was given, we camped on the vast bare hillsides whose slopes, skirted by the Mouzon road, descend to the meadows of the Meuse. In the rear, crowning a plateau, the reserve artillery established themselves in line, pointed their guns towards the defile, to beat the exit, if necessary. And again the wait began, full of revolt and anguish.","There was a moment of despair. What! They’d been marching since first thing with no food, they had just got themselves out of the terrible gorge of Haraucourt by putting a sprint on, and all that so as to bang their heads, in this alarm and confusion, against an impassable wall! It might be hours and hours before the turn of the last comers, and everyone was fully aware that even if the Prussians dared not continue pursuing them through the night they would be there by daybreak. But the order to pile arms was given, and they camped on the great bare hills along the sides of which the Mouzon road runs, and the lower slopes of which run down to the meadows by the Meuse. Behind them, on the top of a plateau, the reserve artillery took up battle positions and trained their guns on the gorge so as to bombard the exit should need arise. And once again the waiting set in, full of resentment and anxiety.","For a while despair reigned. What! they had been marching since morning with nothing to eat, they had summoned up all their energies to escape that deadly trap at Harancourt pass, only in the end to be landed in that slough of despond, with an insurmountable wall staring them in the face! It would be hours, perhaps, before it became the last comer's turn to cross, and everyone knew that even if the Prussians should not be enterprising enough to continue their pursuit in the darkness they would be there with the first glimpse of daylight. Orders came for them to stack muskets, however, and they made their camp on the great range of bare hills which slope downward to the meadows of the Meuse, with the Mouzon road running at their base. To their rear and occupying the level plateau on top of the range the guns of the reserve artillery were arranged in battery, pointed so as to sweep the entrance of the pass should there be necessity for it. And thus commenced another period of agonized, grumbling suspense."
"– Mais, ma chère enfant, je n’ai aucun pouvoir… Il ne faut pas s’adresser à moi…","– But, my dear child, I have no power… You must not address me…","‘But my dear child, I have no power at all… I’m not the one to ask!’","“I am powerless to help you, my child; you should not apply to me.”"

"– Beaumont, Beaumont, on ne sait jamais dans ce sacré pays…","– Beaumont, Beaumont, you never know in this sacred country…","‘Beaumont, Beaumont, you never know in this bloody part of the world.’","The general muttered below his breath: “Beaumont, Beaumont—a man can never tell where he is in this d——d country.”"
"Et il passa, il s’éteignit, sans hoquet, et son visage tranquille, aminci, garda une expression d’infinie tristesse.","And he passed, he died, without a hiccup, and his calm, thin face retained an expression of infinite sadness.","And he departed, snuffed out with not even a gasp, and his face, calm but drawn, had kept its expression of infinite sadness.","And so he passed from life, peacefully, without a struggle; and on his wasted, tranquil face rested an expression of unspeakable melancholy."
"Le canon grondait, il savait bien que d’un instant à l’autre la besogne allait arriver, des voitures pleines de chair saignante ; et il installait violemment la grande salle encore vide. Puis, sous le hangar, ce furent d’autres préparatifs : les caisses de pansement et de pharmacie rangées, ouvertes sur une planche, des paquets de charpie, des bandes, des compresses, des linges, des appareils à fractures ; tandis que, sur une autre planche, à côté d’un gros pot de cérat et d’un flacon de chloroforme, les trousses s’étalaient, l’acier clair des instruments, les sondes, les pinces, les couteaux, les ciseaux, les scies, un arsenal, toutes les formes aiguës et coupantes de ce qui fouille, entaille, tranche, abat. Mais les cuvettes manquaient.","The cannon rumbled, he knew very well that at any moment the job was going to happen, cars full of bleeding flesh; and he violently set up the large hall, which was still empty. Then, under the shed, there were other preparations: the boxes of dressings and medicine ranged, open on a board, bundles of lint, bandages, compresses, linens, broken bones; while on another shelf, next to a large jar of cerate and a flask of chloroform, the kits were spread out, the bright steel of the instruments, the probes, the pliers, the knives, the scissors, the saws, an arsenal, all the sharp and cutting forms of what digs, cuts, slices, knocks down. But the bowls were missing.","The guns were roaring, and he knew that the work would be coming in at any moment now, vehicles full of bleeding flesh, and he was frantically fitting up the big and still empty room. Then there were other preparations going on in the shed: boxes of dressings and medicaments all open and set out on a plank, packets of lint, bandages, compresses, linen, splints for fractures; while on another shelf beside a large pot of ointment and a bottle of chloroform the sets of instruments were laid out, all of shining steel, probes, pincers, knives, scissors, saws, an arsenal of every kind of point and blade for probing, making incisions, slicing, cutting off. But there were no bowls.","The guns were barking, preparing his work for him; he knew that at any moment now the first carriage might drive up and discharge its load of maimed and bleeding flesh, and he hastened to get all in readiness in the great, bare room. Outside in the shed the preparations were of another nature: the chests were opened and their contents arranged in order on a table, packages of lint, bandages, compresses, rollers, splints for fractured limbs, while on another table, alongside a great jar of cerate and a bottle of chloroform, were the surgical cases with their blood-curdling array of glittering instruments, probes, forceps, bistouries, scalpels, scissors, saws, an arsenal of implements of every imaginable shape adapted to pierce, cut, slice, rend, crush. But there was a deficient supply of basins."
"Du coup, Maurice la plaisanta, prenant sa revanche.","Suddenly, Maurice joked, taking his revenge.","Thereupon Maurice teased her, taking his revenge:","Maurice, seeing an opportunity to retort her sermon to him, immediately took her up:"

"En elle, c’était un écroulement. Ce garçon qui lui avait pardonné, qui s’était lié d’une promesse, qu’elle devait épouser, dès qu’il rentrerait du service, la campagne finie ! Et on le lui avait tué, il était là-bas, avec un trou sous le cœur ! Jamais elle n’avait senti qu’elle l’aimait si fort, tellement un besoin de le revoir, de l’avoir malgré tout à elle, même dans la terre, la soulevait, la jetait hors de sa passivité habituelle.","In her, there was a collapse. This boy who had forgiven her, who had bound himself to a promise, whom she was to marry, as soon as he returned from service, the campaign over! And they had killed him, he was over there, with a hole in his heart! She had never felt that she loved him so much, so much a need to see him again, to have him in spite of everything, even in the dirt, lifted her up, threw her out of her habitual passivity.","For her it was the end of the world. This man who had forgiven her, bound himself with a promise, whom she was to marry as soon as he came back from the army after the campaign was over! And they had taken him away from her , he was out there with a hole under the heart! Never had she felt she loved him so much, and now an urge to see him again, to have him to herself in spite of all, even though buried in the ground, lifted her out of her usual passivity.","If it was true she had nothing left to live for. That lad who had been so good to her, who had forgiven her her fault, had plighted his troth and was to marry her when he came home at the end of the campaign! and they had robbed her of him, they had murdered him, and he was lying out there on the battlefield with a wound under the heart! She had never known how strong her love for him had been, and now the thought that she was to see him no more, that he who was hers was hers no longer, aroused her almost to a pitch of madness and made her forget her usual tranquil resignation."
"Très sombre, Maurice marchait en silence, la tête penchée sous le ciel de feu. Il n’avançait plus que dans un cauchemar d’atroce lassitude, halluciné de fantômes, comme s’il allait à un gouffre, là-bas, devant lui ; et c’était une dépression de toute sa culture d’homme instruit, un abaissement qui le tirait à la bassesse des misérables dont il était entouré.","Very dark, Maurice walked in silence, his head bent under the fiery sky. He only advanced in a nightmare of atrocious weariness, hallucinated by ghosts, as if he were going to an abyss, over there, in front of him; and it was a depression of all his culture as an educated man, a lowering which drew him to the baseness of the wretches with whom he was surrounded.","Maurice marched on in sullen silence, head down under the scorching sky. All that was left was to go on in a nightmare of atrocious weariness, haunted by phantoms, as though he were going on into an abyss straight in front of him. His whole upbringing as an educated man was collapsing and he was sinking to the low level of these creatures round him.","Maurice toiled along dejectedly in silence, bowing his head beneath the blazing sun. At every step he took he seemed to be advancing deeper into a horrid, phantom-haunted nightmare; it was as if he saw a yawning, gaping gulf before him toward which he was inevitably tending; it meant that he was suffering himself to be degraded to the level of the miserable beings by whom he was surrounded, that he was prostituting his talents and his position as a man of education."
"Sa chemise avait glissé, une de ses épaules était nue, d’une chair rose et fine, sous les mèches éparses de la noire chevelure ; tandis qu’une odeur pénétrante, une odeur d’amour s’exhalait de son réveil.","His shirt had slipped, one of his shoulders was bare, with a pink and fine flesh, under the scattered strands of black hair; while a penetrating odor, an odor of love exhaled from his awakening.","Her nightdress had slipped down and one of her shoulders was bare, showing her soft pink skin through the strands of her dark hair, and a strong aroma of love came from her awakening body.","Her chemise had slipped downward, exposing a rosy, rounded shoulder, half hidden beneath the wandering raven tresses, and her person exhaled a subtle, penetrating odor, the odor of love."
"Et il succomba, il s’évanouit, entre les bras de Jean, dont l’inquiétude et l’embarras furent extrêmes. Il en oublia de refermer la porte de la rue, et dut le monter à tâtons, dans cet escalier inconnu, en évitant les chocs, de peur d’amener du monde. Puis, en haut, il se perdit, il lui fallut poser le blessé sur une marche, chercher la porte, à l’aide d’allumettes qu’il avait heureusement ; et ce fut seulement lorsqu’il l’eut trouvée, qu’il redescendit le prendre. Enfin, il le coucha sur le petit lit de fer, en face de la fenêtre, dominant Paris, qu’il ouvrit toute large, dans un besoin de grand air et de lumière. Le jour naissait, il tomba devant le lit, sanglotant, assommé et sans force, sous le réveil de cette affreuse pensée qu’il avait tué son ami.","And he succumbed, he fainted, in the arms of Jean, whose anxiety and embarrassment were extreme. He forgot to close the street door, and had to grope up the unknown staircase, avoiding the bumps, for fear of bringing in people. Then, at the top, he got lost, he had to put the wounded man on a step, look for the door, using matches which he fortunately had; and it was only when he had found it that he came down to fetch it. Finally, he laid him on the little iron bed, opposite the window overlooking Paris, which he opened wide, in need of fresh air and light. The day was breaking, he fell in front of the bed, sobbing, stunned and without strength, under the awakening of this dreadful thought that he had killed his friend.","Then he collapsed fainting in Jean’s arms, which worried and embarrassed him terribly, so much so that he forgot to shut the street door behind them, and had to grope his way up this unknown staircase, trying not to bump into anything for fear of attracting attention. At the top he was quite lost and had to put the wounded man down on a step and look for the door by striking some matches which fortunately he had on him, and it was only when he had found it that he came down again and picked him up. At last he laid the boy on the little iron bed opposite the window with its view over Paris, and he opened it wide, wanting some light and air. Day was now breaking, and he fell down beside the bed, weeping and utterly broken and exhausted, as the dreadful thought came back that he had killed his friend.","He succumbed and fainted dead away in Jean's arms, whose alarm and distress were extreme. They made him forget to close the outer door, and he had to grope his way up that strange, dark staircase, bearing his lifeless burden and observing the greatest caution not to stumble or make any noise that might arouse the sleeping inmates of the rooms. When he had gained the top he had to deposit the wounded man on the floor while he searched for the chamber door by striking matches, of which he fortunately had a supply in his pocket, and only when he had found and opened it did he return and raise him in his arms again. Entering, he laid him on the little iron bed that faced the window, which he threw open to its full extent in his great need of air and light. It was broad day; he dropped on his knees beside the bed, sobbing as if his heart would break, suddenly abandoned by all his strength as the fearful thought again smote him that he had slain his friend."

"Ah ! quel soulagement immense, sa fabrique sauvée, l’atroce cauchemar dissipé, la vie qui allait reprendre, douloureuse, mais la vie, la vie enfin ! Neuf heures sonnaient, c’était la petite Rose, accourue dans le quartier, chez une tante boulangère, pour avoir du pain, au travers des rues un peu désencombrées, qui venait de lui conter les événements de la matinée, à la Sous-Préfecture. Dès huit heures, le général de Wimpffen avait réuni un nouveau conseil de guerre, plus de trente généraux, auxquels il avait dit les résultats de sa démarche, ses efforts inutiles, les dures exigences de l’ennemi victorieux. Ses mains tremblaient, une émotion violente lui emplissait les yeux de larmes. Et il parlait encore, lorsqu’un colonel de l’état-major prussien s’était présenté en parlementaire, au nom du général de Moltke, pour rappeler que si, à dix heures, une résolution n’était pas prise, le feu serait rouvert sur la ville de Sedan. Le conseil, alors, devant l’effroyable nécessité, n’avait pu qu’autoriser le général à se rendre de nouveau au château de Bellevue, pour accepter tout. Déjà, le général devait y être, l’armée française entière était prisonnière, avec armes et bagages.","Ah! what an immense relief, his factory saved, the atrocious nightmare dissipated, the life which was about to resume, painful, but life, life at last! Nine o'clock was striking, it was little Rose, who had run to the neighborhood, to a baker's aunt, to get some bread, through the somewhat uncluttered streets, who had just told her about the events of the morning, at the Sub-Prefecture. . At eight o'clock General de Wimpffen had assembled a new council of war, more than thirty generals, to whom he had told the results of his step, his useless efforts, the harsh demands of the victorious enemy. Her hands were shaking, a violent emotion filled her eyes with tears. And he was still talking, when a colonel of the Prussian general staff had presented himself as a parliamentarian, in the name of General de Moltke, to remind them that if, at ten o'clock, a resolution was not taken, the fire would be fired. reopened on the city of Sedan. The council, then, faced with the terrible necessity, had only been able to authorize the general to go again to the castle of Bellevue, to accept everything. Already, the general had to be there, the entire French army was prisoner, with arms and baggage.","Oh, what a tremendous relief, his factory saved, the dreadful nightmare lifted, life going to start up again, painful no doubt, but life, life! It was nine o’clock and young Rose, who had come to this part of the town to get some bread from an aunt who had a baker’s shop – the streets were now somewhat clearer – had told him all that had happened that morning at the Sub-Prefecture. At eight o’clock General de Wimpffen had called a new council of war, more than thirty generals, and told them the outcome of his move, his useless efforts and the harsh demands of the victorious enemy. His hands were shaking and deep emotion filled his eyes with tears. He was still speaking when a colonel from the Prussian headquarters had appeared as an emissary on behalf of General von Moltke to remind them that if a decision was not reached by ten firing would begin again on Sedan. So the council, in the face of dire necessity, could only authorize the general to go again to the Château de Bellevue and accept everything. He must be there by now and the whole French army must be prisoners, together with arms and baggage.","what relief! his horrid nightmare dispelled, his property saved from destruction, his daily life to be resumed, under changed conditions, it is true, but still it was to go on , it was not to cease! It was little Rose who had told him of the occurrences of the morning at the Sous-Prefecture; the girl had come hastening through the streets, now somewhat less choked than they had been, to obtain a supply of bread from an aunt of hers who kept a baker's shop in the quarter; it was striking nine o'clock. As early as eight General de Wimpffen had convened another council of war, consisting of more than thirty generals, to whom he related the results that had been reached so far, the hard conditions imposed by the victorious foe, and his own fruitless efforts to secure a mitigation of them. His emotion was such that his hands shook like a leaf, his eyes were suffused with tears. He was still addressing the assemblage when a colonel of the German staff presented himself, on behalf of General von Moltke, to remind them that, unless a decision were arrived at by ten o'clock, their guns would open fire on the city of Sedan. With this horrible alternative before them the council could do nothing save authorize the general to proceed once more to the Chateau of Bellevue and accept the terms of the victors. He must have accomplished his mission by that time, and the entire French army were prisoners of war."

"Ah ! cette journée du 18 mars, de quelle exaltation décisive elle souleva Maurice ! Plus tard, il ne put se souvenir nettement de ce qu’il avait dit, de ce qu’il avait fait. D’abord, il se revoyait galopant, furieux de la surprise militaire qu’on avait tentée avant le jour, pour désarmer Paris, en reprenant les canons de Montmartre. Depuis deux jours, Thiers, arrivé de Bordeaux, méditait évidemment ce coup de force, afin que l’Assemblée pût sans crainte proclamer la monarchie, à Versailles. Puis, il se revoyait, à Montmartre même, vers neuf heures, enflammé par les récits de victoire qu’on lui faisait, l’arrivée furtive de la troupe, l’heureux retard des attelages qui avait permis aux gardes nationaux de prendre les armes, les soldats n’osant tirer sur les femmes et les enfants, mettant la crosse en l’air, fraternisant avec le peuple. Puis, il se revoyait courant Paris, comprenant dès midi que Paris appartenait à la Commune, sans même qu’il y eût de bataille : Thiers et les ministres en fuite du ministère des Affaires étrangères où ils s’étaient réunis, tout le gouvernement en déroute sur Versailles, les trente mille hommes de troupes emmenés à la hâte, laissant plus de cinq mille des leurs, au travers des rues. Puis, vers cinq heures et demie, à un angle du boulevard extérieur, il se revoyait au milieu d’un groupe de forcenés, écoutant sans indignation le récit abominable du meurtre des généraux Lecomte et Clément Thomas. Ah ! des généraux ! il se rappelait ceux de Sedan, des jouisseurs et des incapables ! un de plus, un de moins, ça n’importait guère ! Et le reste de la journée s’achevait dans la même exaltation, qui déformait pour lui toutes choses, une insurrection que les pavés eux-mêmes semblaient avoir voulue, grandie et d’un coup maîtresse dans la fatalité imprévue de son triomphe, livrant enfin à dix heures du soir l’Hôtel de Ville aux membres du Comité central, étonnés d’y être.","Ah! On that day of March 18, with what decisive exaltation it aroused Maurice! Later, he could not remember clearly what he had said, what he had done. At first he saw himself again galloping, furious at the military surprise which had been attempted before daybreak, to disarm Paris, by retaking the guns of Montmartre. For two days Thiers, who had arrived from Bordeaux, had evidently been meditating on this coup de force, so that the Assembly might fearlessly proclaim the monarchy at Versailles. Then he saw himself again, in Montmartre itself, around nine o'clock, inflamed by the tales of victory that were told to him, the furtive arrival of the troops, the happy delay of the teams which had enabled the National Guardsmen to take up arms. , the soldiers not daring to shoot at the women and children, putting their butts in the air, fraternizing with the people. Then he saw himself again running around Paris, realizing at noon that Paris belonged to the Commune, without even a battle: Thiers and the ministers fleeing from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where they had met, the whole government in rout on Versailles, the thirty thousand troops hastily led away, leaving more than five thousand of their own, through the streets. Then, about half-past five, at a corner of the outer boulevard, he saw himself again in the midst of a group of madmen, listening without indignation to the abominable story of the murder of Generals Lecomte and Clément Thomas. Ah! generals! he remembered those of Sedan, the pleasure-seekers and the incompetents! one more, one less, it didn't matter! And the rest of the day ended in the same exaltation, which distorted everything for him, an insurrection that the cobblestones themselves seemed to have wanted, increased and suddenly masterful in the unforeseen fatality of its triumph, finally delivering at ten o'clock in the evening the Hôtel de Ville to the members of the Central Committee, astonished to be there.","What a day that 18 March was, and how it lifted his heart into a fateful elation! He could never remember later exactly what he had said and done. First he recalled that he had rushed off in a furious rage at the surprise action the military had attempted before daylight, to disarm Paris by getting the guns away again from Montmartre. It was obvious that Thiers, who had returned from Bordeaux, had been planning this coup so that the Assembly could safely proclaim a monarchy at Versailles. His next recollection was that he was in Montmartre himself at about nine in the morning, inflamed by the tales of victory he was told – the furtive arrival of the troops, the fortunate hold-up in the arrival of the drag-ropes which had given time for the National Guards to get their arms, and the soldiers not daring to shoot women and children, but holding their rifles upside down and fraternizing with the people. Then he saw himself hurrying through Paris, realizing by midday that Paris belonged to the Commune without there having been a fight, that Thiers and his cabinet were in flight from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where they had been assembled, in fact that the whole government was running away to Versailles and the thirty thousand soldiers were being hastily withdrawn, leaving over five thousand of their number lying in the streets. Then again, at half past five, he saw himself at a bend in the outer boulevards in the middle of a group of hotheads, listening without any indignation to the horrible story of the murder of Generals Lecomte and Clément Thomas. Oh well, what are generals? He recalled them at Sedan, a comfort-loving, incompetent lot, one more or less didn’t make much difference! The rest of that day went on in the same state of frenzied excitement that distorted everything, an insurrection that the very paving-stones seemed to have willed and which, unforeseen yet inevitable, grew and at a stroke found it had the mastery, eventually handing the Hôtel de Ville over to the members of the Central Committee, who were astonished to find themselves there.","Ah, that day of the 18th of March, the elation and enthusiasm that it aroused in Maurice! In after days he could never remember clearly what he said and did. First he beheld himself dimly, as through a veil of mist, convulsed with rage at the recital of how the troops had attempted, in the darkness and quiet that precedes the dawn, to disarm Paris by seizing the guns on Montmartre heights. It was evident that Thiers, who had arrived from Bordeaux, had been meditating the blow for the last two days, in order that the Assembly at Versailles might proceed without fear to proclaim the monarchy. Then the scene shifted, and he was on the ground at Montmartre itself—about nine o'clock it was—fired by the narrative of the people's victory: how the soldiery had come sneaking up in the darkness, how the delay in bringing up the teams had given the National Guards an opportunity to fly to arms, the troops, having no heart to fire on women and children, reversing their muskets and fraternizing with the people. Then he had wandered desultorily about the city, wherever chance directed his footsteps, and by midday had satisfied himself that the Commune was master of Paris, without even the necessity of striking a blow, for Thiers and the ministers had decamped from their quarters in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the entire government was flying in disorder to Versailles, the thirty thousand troops had been hastily conducted from the city, leaving more than five thousand deserters from their numbers along the line of their retreat. And later, about half-past five in the afternoon, he could recall being at a corner of the exterior boulevard in the midst of a mob of howling lunatics, listening without the slightest evidence of disapproval to the abominable story of the murder of Generals Lecomte and Clement Thomas. Generals, they called themselves; fine generals, they! The leaders they had had at Sedan rose before his memory, voluptuaries and imbeciles; one more, one less, what odds did it make! And the remainder of the day passed in the same state of half-crazed excitement, which served to distort everything to his vision; it was an insurrection that the very stones of the streets seemed to have favored, spreading, swelling, finally becoming master of all at a stroke in the unforeseen fatality of its triumph, and at ten o'clock in the evening delivering the Hotel de Ville over to the members of the Central Committee, who were greatly surprised to find themselves there."
"– Nom de Dieu ! jura d’une voix sourde Jean, qui retint un cri de douleur.","- For God Sake ! Jean swore in a muffled voice, suppressing a cry of pain.","‘Oh Christ!’ Jean swore under his breath, stifling a cry of pain.","“Nom de Dieu!” ejaculated Jean, with a stifled cry of pain."
"Ils s’attablèrent, ravis. Et lui, envahi d’un froid grandissant, les regardait, dans leur déchéance lamentable de soldats sans armes, vêtus de pantalons rouges et de capotes si rattachés de ficelles, rapiécés de tant de lambeaux différents, qu’ils ressemblaient à des pillards, à des bohémiens achevant d’user la défroque de quelque champ de bataille.","They sat down, delighted. And he, invaded by a growing coldness, watched them, in their lamentable decay of unarmed soldiers, dressed in red trousers and greatcoats so fastened with strings, patched with so many different shreds, that they looked like looters, gypsies wearing out the cast-offs of some battlefield.","They sat down, thrilled. But he felt a chill come over him as he looked at these disarmed soldiers in their pitiful state, with their red trousers and capes so tied up with string and patched with so many odds and ends that they looked like rag-pickers or gypsies wearing out the clothes picked up on some battlefield.","They drew their chairs up to the table, only too delighted with the invitation. Their entertainer watched them as they attacked the food, and a thrill of pity ran through him as he beheld their sorry plight, dirty, ragged, arms gone, their sole attire a pair of red trousers and the capote, kept in place by bits of twine and so patched and pieced with shreds of vari-colored cloth that one would have taken them for men who had been looting some battle-field and were wearing the spoil they had gathered there."
"Et, sèchement, au caporal :","And, curtly, to the corporal:",And to the corporal he snapped:,"“Stay where you are, Weiss,” he said, and turning to the corporal, curtly added: “This gentleman is my brother-in-law."
"Lui et un camarade prirent le corps, l’emportèrent au charnier qu’on avait établi derrière les cytises. Une douzaine de morts, déjà, s’y trouvaient rangés, raidis dans le dernier râle, les uns les pieds étirés, comme allongés par la souffrance, les autres déjetés, tordus en des postures atroces. Il y en avait qui ricanaient, les yeux blancs, les dents à nu sous les lèvres retroussées ; tandis que plusieurs, la figure longue, affreusement triste, pleuraient encore de grosses larmes. Un, très jeune, petit et maigre, la tête à moitié emportée, serrait sur son cœur, de ses deux mains convulsives, une photographie de femme, une de ces pâles photographies de faubourg, éclaboussée de sang. Et, aux pieds des morts, pêle-mêle, des jambes et des bras coupés s’entassaient aussi, tout ce qu’on rognait, tout ce qu’on abattait sur les tables d’opération, le coup de balai de la boutique d’un boucher, poussant dans un coin les déchets, la chair et les os.","He and a comrade took the body, carried it to the mass grave which had been established behind the laburnum. A dozen dead were already lined up there, stiffened in the last death rattle, some with their feet stretched out, as if elongated by suffering, others thrown off, twisted in atrocious postures. There were those who sneered, their eyes white, their teeth bared under their upturned lips; while several, long-faced, terribly sad, were still crying big tears. One, very young, small and thin, his head half blown off, clutched to his heart, with his two convulsive hands, a photograph of a woman, one of those pale photographs of the suburbs, splattered with blood. And, at the feet of the dead, pell-mell, severed arms and legs were also piled up, everything that was trimmed, everything that was knocked down on the operating tables, the sweep of the shop of a butcher, pushing waste, flesh and bones into a corner.","And he and a comrade took the corpse and carried it off to the charnel-house they had made behind the laburnums. There were already a dozen or so dead put out there just as they had stiffened at the end, some with feet thrust out as though they had been on the rack with pain, others all deformed and twisted in horrible postures. Some were grinning, with white eyes and teeth showing between turned-back lips, and many of them, with drawn and terribly sad faces, were still weeping bitterly. One very young fellow, short and thin with half his head gone, was still convulsively clasping on his heart with both hands a woman’s photo, one of those dim photos from a suburban shop, and it was splashed with blood. And at the feet of the dead were the heaps of arms and legs, and in fact anything cut out or hacked off on the operating tables, the sweepings of a butcher’s shop when he had swept the refuse of flesh and bones into a corner.","He and one of his mates took the body by the arms and legs and carried it off to the morgue that had been extemporized behind the lilac bushes. A dozen corpses were already there in a row, stiff and stark, some drawn out to their full length as if in an attempt to rid themselves of the agony that racked them, others curled and twisted in every attitude of suffering. Some seemed to have left the world with a sneer on their faces, their eyes retroverted till naught was visible but the whites, the grinning lips parted over the glistening teeth, while in others, with faces unspeakably sorrowful, big tears still stood on the cheeks. One, a mere boy, short and slight, half whose face had been shot away by a cannon-ball, had his two hands clasped convulsively above his heart, and in them a woman's photograph, one of those pale, blurred pictures that are made in the quarters of the poor, bedabbled with his blood. And at the feet of the dead had been thrown in a promiscuous pile the amputated arms and legs, the refuse of the knife and saw of the operating table, just as the butcher sweeps into a corner of his shop the offal, the worthless odds and ends of flesh and bone."

"Le 106e, entraîné, s’ébranla. Une des premières, la compagnie Beaudoin s’était mise debout, au milieu des plaisanteries, les hommes disant qu’ils étaient rouillés, qu’ils avaient de la terre dans les jointures. Mais, dès les premiers pas, on dut se jeter au fond d’une tranchée-abri qu’on rencontra, tellement le feu devenait vif. Et l’on fila en pliant l’échine.","The 106th, trained, set off. One of the first, the Beaudoin company, had stood up, amid jokes, the men saying that they were rusty, that they had dirt in their joints. But, from the very first steps, we had to throw ourselves into the bottom of a trench-shelter which we came across, the fire was so fierce. And we sped off, bending our backs.","Deeply stirred, the 106th began to move. The Beaudoin company was one of the first to get to its feet, amid jokes among the chaps who said they were rusty and had earth in their joints. But after a few steps they had to throw themselves into a trench that they came across because the fire got so fierce. Then they ran on bent double.","A thrill of enthusiasm ran through the ranks at the brief address, and the regiment put itself in motion. Beaudoin's company was among the first to get on its feet, which it did to the accompaniment of much good-natured chaff, the men declaring they were so rusty they could not move; the gravel must have penetrated their joints. The fire was so hot, however, that by the time they had advanced a few feet they were glad to avail themselves of the protection of a shelter trench that lay in their path, along which they crept in an undignified posture, bent almost double. “Now, young fellow, look out for yourself!”"
– Et Bazaine ? demanda Rochas.,"""And Bazaine?"" Rochas asked.",‘And what about Bazaine?’ asked Rochas.,“And what of Bazaine?” asked Rochas.

"Ils ne l’écoutaient pas, ne l’entendaient pas, ne songeaient qu’à eux, dans l’instinct surexcité de la conservation. Déjà, ils se glissaient sur les genoux, disparaissaient, au galop, vers le petit mur. Les Prussiens n’étaient plus qu’à cent mètres.","They did not listen to him, did not hear him, thought only of themselves, in the overexcited instinct of self-preservation. Already they were slipping on their knees, disappearing at a gallop towards the low wall. The Prussians were only a hundred yards away.","They took no notice, couldn’t hear, were only concerned with themselves, with the sharpened instinct of self-preservation. Already they were moving along on their knees as fast as they could go, out of sight behind the wall. The Prussians were now only a hundred metres away.","They were deaf to his entreaties; all they could hear was the voice that urged them to seek safety for themselves. The Prussians were now not more than a hundred yards from them; already they were on their hands and knees, crawling as fast as they could go toward the wall."
"Alors, Henriette retira ses mains, frissonnante, toute blanche, avec des yeux de terreur qui le regardaient fixement. C’était donc la fin de tout, et rien n’allait donc survivre, dans son cœur broyé ? Ah ! ce Jean, à qui elle pensait le soir même, heureuse du vague espoir de le revoir peut-être ! Et il avait fait cette chose abominable, et il venait pourtant de sauver encore Maurice, puisque c’était lui qui l’avait rapporté là, au travers de tant de dangers ! Elle ne pouvait plus lui abandonner ses mains, sans un recul de tout son être. Mais elle eut un cri, où elle mit la dernière espérance de son cœur combattu.","Then Henriette withdrew her hands, shivering, quite white, with eyes of terror that stared at him. So it was the end of everything, and nothing was going to survive, in his crushed heart? Ah! that Jean, of whom she was thinking that very evening, happy in the vague hope of perhaps seeing him again! And he had done this abominable thing, and yet he had just saved Maurice again, since it was he who had brought him back there, through so many dangers! She could no longer leave her hands to him, without a recoil of her whole being. But she gave a cry, in which she placed the last hope of her battered heart.","Then Henriette withdrew her hands, shuddering, white and staring at him with horrified eyes. So this was the end of it all, and nothing would survive in her broken heart? Oh, Jean, she had been thinking about him that very evening and been so happy in the faint hope of seeing him again! And he had done this unspeakable thing, and yet he had saved Maurice once again, for he had brought him back here through so many dangers! She could not give him her hands again without a revulsion in her whole being. Yet she uttered a cry into which she put the last hope of her divided heart.","Then Henriette, shivering, pale as death, withdrew her hands, fixing on him a gaze that was full of horror. Father of Mercy, was the end of all things come! was her crushed and bleeding heart to know no peace for ever more! Ah, that Jean, of whom she had been thinking that very day, happy in the unshaped hope that perhaps she might see him once again! And it was he who had done that abominable thing; and yet he had saved Maurice, for was it not he who had brought him home through so many perils? She could not yield her hands to him now without a revolt of all her being, but she uttered a cry into which she threw the last hope of her tortured and distracted heart."
– Faut-il lui casser la gueule ? demanda-t-il.,"""Should we kick his ass?"" he asked.",‘Shall I blow his face in?’ he asked.,“Shall I let him have it?” he asked.
"– Tout de même, dit Jean à Maurice, comme ils revenaient plier la tente, ce sont trois bons bougres, d’avoir fait quatre lieues à travers champs pour nous prévenir.","""All the same,"" said Jean to Maurice, as they came back to fold up the tent, ""they're three good buggers to have come four leagues across the fields to warn us.""","‘All the same,’ Jean said to Maurice as they went back to fold the tent, ‘those three are decent blokes to have done four leagues cross-country to warn us.’","“They are good fellows, all the same,” Jean said to Maurice, as they were returning to fold the tent, “to have tramped three leagues across lots to let us know.”"
"– Je vais à Bazeilles rejoindre mon mari, déclara Henriette de sa voix douce, tandis que ses yeux d’un bleu pâle gardaient leur tranquille décision.","“I am going to Bazeilles to join my husband,” declared Henriette in her soft voice, while her pale blue eyes retained their calm decision.","‘I’m going to Bazeilles to join my husband,’ Henriette declared in her gentle voice, and her light blue eyes kept their quiet determination.","“I am going to Bazeilles to look for my husband,” Henriette declared, in her gentle voice, while her blue eyes shone with undiminished resolution."

"– Eh bien ! reprit Weiss, ce sont les Prussiens… Depuis ce matin, je les regarde, et il en passe, il en passe toujours ! Ah ! je vous promets que, si nos soldats les attendent, eux se dépêchent d’arriver !… Et tous les habitants de la ville les ont vus comme moi, il n’y a vraiment que les généraux qui ont les yeux bouchés. J’ai causé tout à l’heure avec un général, il a haussé les épaules, il m’a dit que le maréchal de Mac-Mahon était absolument convaincu d’avoir à peine soixante-dix mille hommes devant lui. Dieu veuille qu’il soit bien renseigné !… Mais, regardez-les donc ! la terre en est couverte, elles viennent, elles viennent, les fourmis noires !","- Well ! resumed Weiss, it's the Prussians. Since this morning, I've been watching them, and they're going on, they're always going on! Ah! I promise you that, if our soldiers are waiting for them, they will hurry to arrive! … And all the inhabitants of the city have seen them like me, it is really only the generals who have their eyes closed. I was talking to a general just now, he shrugged his shoulders, he told me that Marshal de Mac-Mahon was absolutely convinced that he had barely seventy thousand men in front of him. God grant that he is well informed!... But look at them! the earth is covered with them, they come, they come, the black ants!","‘Well,’ said Weiss, ‘those are the Prussians… I’ve been watching them ever since this morning, and they keep going on and on! Oh, I can tell you, if our soldiers are waiting for them they are in a hurry to get here! And all the inhabitants of this town have seen them, same as me, and really the generals are the only ones with their eyes blindfolded. I was talking just now to a general and he shrugged his shoulders and told me that Marshal MacMahon was absolutely convinced he had scarcely seventy thousand men opposing him. God grant he is well informed… But just look at them, the ground is covered with them, and still they come and come, like black ants!’","“Well,” continued Weiss, “those are Prussians. I have been watching them since morning, and they have been coming, coming, as if there were no end to them! You may be sure of one thing: if our troops are waiting for them, they have no intention of disappointing us. And not I alone, but every soul in the city saw them; it is only the generals who persist in being blind. I was talking with a general officer a little while ago; he shrugged his shoulders and told me that Marshal MacMahon was absolutely certain that he had not over seventy thousand men in his front. God grant he may be right! But look and see for yourselves; the ground is hid by them! they keep coming, ever coming, the black swarm!”"
"– C’est bon, dit de son air sage ce dernier, qui ne pouvait engager une lutte. Nous réglerons ça ce soir.","- It's good, said with his wise air the latter, who could not engage in a fight. We'll fix that tonight.","‘All right,’ said Jean in his sensible voice, for he couldn’t risk starting a fight, ‘we’ll settle this tonight.’","“Very well,” said the other in his quiet way, knowing that resistance would be of no avail, “we will settle accounts to-night.”"
"Dehors, Maurice tâcha de se procurer des journaux. Il se bourra les poches de tous les numéros qu’il put acheter ; et il les lisait en marchant, sous les grands arbres des magnifiques promenades qui bordent la ville. Où étaient donc les armées allemandes ? Il semblait qu’on les eût perdues. Deux sans doute se trouvaient du côté de Metz : la première, celle que le général Steinmetz commandait, surveillant la place ; la seconde, celle du prince Frédéric-Charles, tâchant de remonter la rive droite de la Moselle, pour couper à Bazaine la route de Paris. Mais la troisième armée, celle du prince royal de Prusse, l’armée victorieuse à Wissembourg et à Frœschwiller, et qui poursuivait le 1er corps et le 5e, où était-elle réellement, au milieu du gâchis des informations contradictoires ? Campait-elle encore à Nancy ? Arrivait-elle devant Châlons, pour qu’on eût quitté le camp avec une telle hâte, en incendiant les magasins, des objets d’équipement, des fourrages, des provisions de toutes sortes ? Et la confusion, les hypothèses les plus contraires recommençaient d’ailleurs, à propos des plans qu’on prêtait aux généraux. Maurice, comme séparé du monde, apprit seulement alors les événements de Paris : le coup de foudre de la défaite sur tout un peuple certain de la victoire, l’émotion terrible des rues, la convocation des Chambres, la chute du ministère libéral qui avait fait le plébiscite, l’empereur déchu de son titre de général en chef, forcé de passer le commandement suprême au maréchal Bazaine. Depuis le 16, l’empereur était au camp de Châlons, et tous les journaux parlaient d’un grand conseil, tenu le 17, où avaient assisté le prince Napoléon et des généraux ; mais ils ne s’accordaient guère entre eux sur les véritables décisions prises, en dehors des faits qui en résultaient : le général Trochu nommé gouverneur de Paris, le maréchal de Mac-Mahon mis à la tête de l’armée de Châlons, ce qui impliquait le complet effacement de l’empereur. On sentait un effarement, une irrésolution immenses, des plans opposés, qui se combattaient, qui se succédaient d’heure en heure. Et toujours cette question : où donc étaient les armées allemandes ? Qui avait raison, de ceux qui prétendaient Bazaine libre, en train d’opérer sa retraite par les places du Nord, ou de ceux qui le disaient déjà bloqué sous Metz ? Un bruit persistant courait de gigantesques batailles, de luttes héroïques soutenues du 14 au 20, pendant toute une semaine, sans qu’il s’en dégageât autre chose qu’un formidable retentissement d’armes, lointain et perdu.","Outside, Maurice tried to get some newspapers. He stuffed his pockets with all the numbers he could buy; and he read them as he walked, under the tall trees of the magnificent promenades which border the town. Where were the German armies? It looked like we had lost them. Two, no doubt, were on the side of Metz: the first, that which General Steinmetz commanded, watching the place; the second, that of Prince Frederic-Charles, endeavoring to ascend the right bank of the Moselle, to cut Bazaine off from the road to Paris. But the third army, that of the Royal Prince of Prussia, the victorious army at Wissembourg and Frœschwiller, and which was pursuing the 1st Corps and the 5th, where was it really, amidst the mess of contradictory information? Was she still camping in Nancy? Was it arriving in front of Châlons, for they had left the camp in such haste, setting fire to the stores, articles of equipment, fodder, provisions of all kinds? And the confusion, the most contrary hypotheses began again, in connection with the plans attributed to the generals. Maurice, as if separated from the world, only then learned of the events in Paris: the thunderbolt of defeat on an entire people certain of victory, the terrible emotion of the streets, the convocation of the Chambers, the fall of the liberal ministry which had made the plebiscite, the emperor stripped of his title of general-in-chief, forced to hand over supreme command to Marshal Bazaine. Since the 16th, the Emperor had been in the camp of Châlons, and all the newspapers spoke of a great council, held on the 17th, at which Prince Napoleon and some generals had been present; but they hardly agreed among themselves on the real decisions taken, apart from the facts which resulted from them: General Trochu appointed governor of Paris, Marshal de Mac-Mahon placed at the head of the army of Châlons, which implied the complete obliteration of the emperor. One felt a bewilderment, an immense irresolution, opposing plans, which fought each other, which succeeded each other from hour to hour. And always this question: where were the German armies? Who was right, of those who claimed Bazaine was free, in the process of effecting his retreat through the northern squares, or of those who said he was already blocked under Metz? There was a persistent noise of gigantic battles, of heroic struggles sustained from the 14th to the 20th, for a whole week, without anything being emanating from them other than a formidable sound of arms, distant and lost.","Out in the street Maurice tried to find some newspapers, and stuffed his pockets with all the ones he could buy, reading them as he walked along under the big trees in the magnificent boulevards which surround the town. Where were the German armies, then? They seemed to have got lost. There were probably two on the Metz front: the first under the command of General Steinmetz covering the fortress, the second under Prince Friedrich Karl trying to follow the right bank of the Moselle so as to cut Bazaine’s route to Paris. But the third army, that of the Crown Prince of Prussia, and the victorious army of Wissembourg and Froeschwiller which was pursuing the 1st and 5th corps, where was it really, in the muddle of contradictory reports? Still in camp at Nancy? Had it been threatening Châlons, which would explain their leaving the camp in such haste, burning stores, equipment, forage and all kinds of provisions? And then again more confusion and the most contradictory theories about plans the generals might have. As though he had been cut off from the world, Maurice only learned then what had happened in Paris: the stupefying shock of defeat on a whole people certain of victory, the terrible outburst of emotion in the streets, the recall of both Chambers, the fall of the liberal administration that had organized the plebiscite, the Emperor deprived of the title of Commander-in-Chief and forced to hand over the supreme command to Marshal Bazaine. Since the 16th the Emperor had been in the Châlons camp, and all the papers mentioned a grand council held on the 17th at which Prince Napoleon and several generals had been present. But there was no agreement between them about the real decisions made, as distinct from facts which had resulted: General Trochu appointed governor of Paris, Marshal MacMahon put at the head of the army of Châlons, which implied complete elimination of the Emperor. One could sense infinite dismay and indecision, contrary plans fighting each other and replacing each other hour by hour. And always the question, where were the German armies? Who were right, those who made out that Bazaine was a free agent, carrying out his withdrawal towards the northern fortresses, or those who said he was already beleaguered in Metz? A persistent rumour told of gigantic battles and heroic struggles going on between the 14th and 20th, a whole week, but nothing was clear except a tremendous clash of arms somewhere far away and out of ken.","When outside upon the street Maurice hailed a newsboy and purchased a copy of every paper he could lay hands on, stuffing some in his pockets and reading others as he walked along under the stately trees that line the pleasant avenues of the old city. Where could the German armies be? It seemed as if obscurity had suddenly swallowed them up. Two were over Metz way, of course: the first, the one commanded by General von Steinmetz, observing the place; the second, that of Prince Frederick Charles, aiming to ascend the right bank of the Moselle in order to cut Bazaine off from Paris. But the third army, that of the Crown Prince of Prussia, the army that had been victorious at Wissembourg and Froeschwiller and had driven our 1st and 5th corps, where was it now, where was it to be located amid the tangled mess of contradictory advices? Was it still in camp at Nancy, or was it true that it had arrived before Chalons, and was that the reason why we had abandoned our camp there in such hot haste, burning our stores, clothing, forage, provisions, everything—property of which the value to the nation was beyond compute? And when the different plans with which our generals were credited came to be taken into consideration, then there was more confusion, a fresh set of contradictory hypotheses to be encountered. Maurice had until now been cut off in a measure from the outside world, and now for the first time learned what had been the course of events in Paris; the blasting effect of defeat upon a populace that had been confident of victory, the terrible commotions in the streets, the convoking of the Chambers, the fall of the liberal ministry that had effected the plebiscite, the abrogation of the Emperor's rank as General of the Army and the transfer of the supreme command to Marshal Bazaine. The Emperor had been present at the camp of Chalons since the 16th, and all the newspapers were filled with a grand council that had been held on the 17th, at which Prince Napoleon and some of the generals were present, but none of them were agreed upon the decisions that had been arrived at outside of the resultant facts, which were that General Trochu had been appointed governor of Paris and Marshal MacMahon given the command of the army of Chalons, and the inference from this was that the Emperor was to be shorn of all his authority. Consternation, irresolution, conflicting plans that were laid aside and replaced by fresh ones hour by hour; these were the things that everybody felt were in the air. And ever and always the question: Where were the German armies? Who were in the right, those who asserted that Bazaine had no force worth mentioning in front of him and was free to make his retreat through the towns of the north whenever he chose to do so, or those who declared that he was already besieged in Metz? There was a constantly recurring rumor of a series of engagements that had raged during an entire week, from the 14th until the 20th, but it failed to receive confirmation."
"– Ah ! oui, fini ! jusqu’à ce que ça recommence !… Rien n’est signé.","– Ah! yes, finished! until it starts again!... Nothing is signed.","‘Oh yes, all over until it starts again! Nothing’s been signed.’","“Oh, yes, all over! until it begins again! There is nothing signed.”"
"À midi, toujours pas un seul Prussien. À une heure, à deux heures, rien encore. Et la lassitude arrivait, le doute aussi. Des voix goguenardes commençaient à blaguer les généraux. Peut-être bien qu’ils avaient vu leur ombre sur le mur. On leur votait des lunettes. De jolis farceurs, si rien ne venait, d’avoir ainsi dérangé tout le monde ! Un loustic cria :","At noon, still not a single Prussian. At one o'clock, at two o'clock, nothing yet. And the weariness arrived, the doubt too. Jerking voices began to prank the generals. Maybe they had seen their shadow on the wall. We voted them glasses. Pretty pranksters, if nothing happened, to have disturbed everyone! A wag shouted:","By noon still not a single Prussian. By one, by two, still nothing. Everybody was getting sick of it, and sceptical as well. Jeering voices began to poke fun at the generals. Perhaps they had seen their own shadows on the wall. They voted to get them some glasses. A fine lot of jokers to have upset everybody like this if nothing was coming! Some wag called out:","Midday came, and not a sign of the Prussians. At one o'clock, at two, it was the same, and a reaction of lassitude and doubt began to prevail among the troops. Derisive jeers were heard at the expense of the generals: perhaps they had seen their shadow on the wall; they should be presented with a pair of spectacles. A pretty set of humbugs they were, to have caused all that trouble for nothing! A fellow who passed for a wit among his comrades shouted:"
"Une décharge, partie du grenier et du premier étage, coucha par terre trois des Bavarois qui s’avançaient, en rasant les murs. Les autres se replièrent, s’embusquèrent à tous les angles de la route ; et le siège de la maison commença, une telle pluie de balles fouetta la façade qu’on aurait dit un ouragan de grêle. Pendant près de dix minutes, cette fusillade ne cessa pas, trouant le plâtre, sans faire grand mal. Mais un des hommes que le capitaine avait pris avec lui dans le grenier, ayant commis l’imprudence de se montrer à une lucarne, fut tué raide, d’une balle en plein front.","A volley from the attic and the first floor knocked down three of the Bavarians who were advancing, skimming the walls. The others fell back, took up ambush at every angle of the road; and the siege of the house began, such a rain of bullets lashed the facade that it looked like a hailstorm. For nearly ten minutes, this shooting did not stop, piercing the plaster, without doing much harm. But one of the men whom the captain had taken with him into the attic, having committed the imprudence of showing himself at a skylight, was killed stiffly, with a bullet in the forehead.","A volley from the attic and the first floor laid low three Bavarians who were creeping along by the walls. The others fell back and took cover in all the corners along the road; the siege of the house began, such a rain of bullets lashed the front that it was like a hailstorm. For nearly ten minutes this fusillade went on, making holes in the plaster but not doing much harm. But one of the men the captain had taken up with him into the attic was imprudent enough to show himself at a dormer window, and he was killed instantly with a bullet through the forehead.","A simultaneous discharge from the attic and the first floor laid low three of the Bavarians, who had come forward hugging the walls. The remainder of the body fell back and posted themselves under cover wherever the street offered facilities, and the siege of the house began; the bullets pelted on the front like rattling hail. For nearly ten minutes the fusillade continued without cessation, damaging the stucco, but not doing much mischief otherwise, until one of the men whom the lieutenant had taken with him to the garret was so imprudent as to show himself at a window, when a bullet struck him square in the forehead, killing him instantly. It was plain that whoever exposed himself would do so at peril of his life."
"Les premiers jours, la fièvre du blessé fut si intense, qu’Henriette ne le quitta guère. Chaque matin, en passant, le docteur Dalichamp entrait, sous le prétexte de la prendre, pour se rendre avec elle à l’ambulance ; et il examinait Jean, le pansait. La balle, après avoir cassé le tibia, étant ressortie, il s’étonnait du mauvais aspect de la plaie, il craignait que la présence d’une esquille, introuvable pourtant sous la sonde, ne l’obligeât à une résection de l’os. Il en avait causé avec Jean ; mais celui-ci, à la pensée d’un raccourcissement de la jambe, qui l’aurait rendu boiteux, s’était révolté : non, non ! il préférait mourir que de rester infirme. Et le docteur, laissant la blessure en observation, se contentait donc de la panser avec de la charpie imbibée d’huile d’olive et d’acide phénique, après avoir placé au fond de la plaie un drain, un tube de caoutchouc, pour l’écoulement du pus. Seulement, il l’avait averti que, s’il n’intervenait pas, la guérison pourrait être extrêmement longue. Dès la seconde semaine, cependant, la fièvre diminua, l’état devint meilleur, à la condition d’une immobilité complète.","For the first few days, the wounded man's fever was so intense that Henriette hardly left him. Every morning, as he passed, Doctor Dalichamp came in, under the pretext of picking her up, to go with her to the ambulance; and he examined Jean, bandaged him. The bullet, after having broken the tibia, having come out, he was surprised at the bad aspect of the wound, he feared that the presence of a splinter, however not found under the probe, would oblige him to resection the bone. . He had talked about it with Jean; but this one, at the thought of a shortening of the leg, which would have made him lame, had revolted: no, no! he would rather die than remain crippled. And the doctor, leaving the wound under observation, contented himself with dressing it with lint soaked in olive oil and carbolic acid, after having placed a drain, a rubber tube, at the bottom of the wound, to the discharge of pus. Only, he had warned him that, if he did not intervene, the recovery could be extremely long. From the second week, however, the fever subsided, the state became better, on condition of complete immobility.","During the first days he had such a high temperature that Henriette hardly ever left him. Every morning on his rounds Dr Dalichamp looked in, on the pretext of taking her to the hospital, and he examined Jean and dressed his wound. As the bullet had come out again after breaking the tibia, he was surprised at the ugly look of the wound and was afraid that the presence of a splinter of bone, which he could not find with the probe, might necessitate a resection of the bone. He had discussed it with Jean, who was horrified at the thought of a short leg which would make him lame – no, no, he’d rather die than be permanently disabled! And so the doctor, keeping the wound under observation, simply went on dressing it with a pad soaked in olive oil and carbolic, after inserting a drain, a rubber tube to take away the pus. But the doctor had warned him that if he did not intervene it might take a very long time indeed to heal. But by the second week the temperature did go down and things improved so long as complete immobility was maintained.","The patient's fever was so violent during the first few days that Henriette scarce ever left him. Doctor Dalichamp dropped in every morning on his way to the hospital and examined and dressed the wound. As the ball had passed out, after breaking the tibia, he was surprised that the case presented no better aspect; he feared there was a splinter of the bone remaining there that he had not succeeded in finding with the probe, and that might make resection necessary. He mentioned the matter to Jean, but the young man could not endure the thought of an operation that would leave him with one leg shorter than the other and lame him permanently. No, no! he would rather die than be a cripple for life. So the good doctor, leaving the wound to develop further symptoms, confined himself for the present to applying a dressing of lint saturated with sweet oil and phenic acid having first inserted a drain—an India rubber tube—to carry off the pus. He frankly told his patient, however, that unless he submitted to an operation he must not hope to have the use of his limb for a very long time. Still, after the second week, the fever subsided and the young man's general condition was improved, so long as he could be content to rest quiet in his bed."

"Elle vit alors seulement ce grand gaillard blond, à la barbe et aux cheveux frisés, à l’épaisse face rose, dont les gros yeux bleus luisaient d’un éclat de faïence. Et c’était bien vrai, le petit avait la même tignasse jaune, les mêmes joues, les mêmes yeux clairs, toute la race de là-bas en lui. Elle-même se sentait autre, avec les mèches de ses cheveux noirs, qui glissaient de son chignon sur son épaule, dans son désordre.","It was only then that she saw this tall blond fellow, with the beard and curly hair, the thick pink face, whose large blue eyes shone with a gleam of earthenware. And it was very true, the little one had the same yellow mop of hair, the same cheeks, the same light eyes, the whole race from there in him. She herself felt different, with the locks of her black hair, which slipped from her bun over her shoulder, in her mess.","And only then did she really see this tall, fair man with his curly hair and beard, wide pink face and big blue eyes shining like porcelain. It was quite true, the child had the same yellow mop of hair, same cheeks, same light-coloured eyes, all that race was in him. She felt she was the different one, with her straight dark hair, strands of which had come out of her chignon and were hanging down her back.","She turned her eyes on the big, strapping lothario, with his curling hair and beard and his broad, pink face, in which the great blue eyes gleamed like globes of polished porcelain; and it was only too true, the little one had the same yellow thatch, the same rounded cheeks, the same light eyes; every feature of the hated race was reproduced faithfully in him. A tress of her jet black hair that had escaped from its confinement and wandered down upon her shoulder in the agitation of the moment showed her how little there was in common between the child and her."
"Jamais encore Jean n’avait embrassé Henriette. Avant de remonter dans le cabriolet, avec le docteur, il voulut la remercier de ses bons soins, de l’avoir soigné et aimé comme un frère. Mais il ne trouva pas les mots, il ouvrit les bras, il l’embrassa en sanglotant. Elle était éperdue, elle lui rendit son baiser. Quand le cheval partit, il se retourna, leurs mains s’agitèrent, tandis qu’ils répétaient d’une voix bégayante :","Never before had Jean kissed Henriette. Before getting back into the cabriolet with the doctor, he wanted to thank her for her good care, for having cared for and loved him like a brother. But he couldn't find the words, he opened his arms, he kissed her sobbing. She was distraught, she kissed him back. When the horse left, he turned around, their hands waved, while they repeated in a stammering voice:","Until then Jean had never embraced Henriette. Before climbing into the trap with the doctor he wanted to thank her for her care and kindness, for having looked after him and loved him like a brother. But the words would not come, so he opened his arms and embraced her, in tears. She was almost distraught and returned his kiss. When the horse started off he turned and they waved to one another and managed to say:","In all their intimacy Jean had never yet kissed Henriette. Before resuming his seat in the gig with the doctor he endeavored to thank her for all her devoted kindness, for having nursed and loved him as a brother, but somehow the words would not come at his command; he opened his arms and, with a great sob, clasped her in a long embrace, and she, beside herself with the grief of parting, returned his kiss. Then the horse started, he turned about in his seat, there was a waving of hands, while again and again two sorrowful voices repeated in choking accents:"
"Mais, derrière leur tente, Maurice s’exaltait, répétait à Jean :","But, behind their tent, Maurice was getting excited, repeating to Jean:","But behind their tent Maurice was getting worked up again, and saying over and over again to Jean:","But Maurice drew Jean behind their tent and again said to him in his nervous, flighty way:"
"Mais, dans les journaux que le docteur Dalichamp apportait, Bazaine restait le grand homme, le brave soldat, dont la France attendait encore son salut. Et Jean se faisait relire des passages, pour bien comprendre comment la troisième armée allemande, avec le prince royal de Prusse, avait pu les poursuivre, tandis que la première et la deuxième bloquaient Metz, toutes les deux si fortes en hommes et en canons, qu’il était devenu possible d’y puiser et d’en détacher cette quatrième armée, qui, sous les ordres du prince royal de Saxe, avait achevé le désastre de Sedan. Puis, renseigné enfin, sur ce lit de douleur où le clouait sa blessure, il se forçait quand même à l’espoir.","But, in the newspapers which Doctor Dalichamp brought, Bazaine remained the great man, the brave soldier, from whom France still awaited his salvation. And Jean had passages re-read to him, to understand how the Third German Army, with the Royal Prince of Prussia, had been able to pursue them, while the First and Second were blockading Metz, both so strong in men and guns, that it had become possible to draw from it and detach from it that fourth army, which, under the orders of the Prince Royal of Saxony, had completed the disaster of Sedan. Then, finally informed, on this bed of pain where his wound nailed him, he still forced himself to hope.","But in the papers brought by Dr Dalichamp Bazaine was still the great man, the gallant soldier by whom France still expected to be saved. Jean made her re-read certain passages in order to grasp how the third German army, with the Crown Prince of Prussia, had been able to pursue them while the first and second were blocking Metz, both of them so strong in men and guns that it had been possible to take some from them and form this fourth army which, under the command of the Crown Prince of Saxony, had made the disaster of Sedan certain. When at last he understood, on this bed of pain to which his wound pinned him down, he forced himself to go on hoping.","But in the papers that Doctor Dalichamp brought them Bazaine was still the great man and the gallant soldier, to whom France looked for her salvation. And Jean wanted certain passages read to him again, in order that he might more clearly understand how it was that while the third German army, under the Crown Prince of Prussia, had been leading them such a dance, and the first and second were besieging Metz, the latter were so strong in men and guns that it had been possible to form from them a fourth army, which, under the Crown Prince of Saxony, had done so much to decide the fortune of the day at Sedan. Then, having obtained the information he desired, resting on that bed of suffering to which his wound condemned him, he forced himself to hope in spite of all."
"Déjà, Maurice, Jean, d’autres arrivaient, lorsqu’une voix enrouée s’éleva :","Already, Maurice, Jean, others were arriving, when a hoarse voice arose:","Maurice, Jean and others were already running up when a hoarse voice croaked:","Maurice, Jean, and others came running up in haste, when a hoarse voice made itself heard:"
"Il était neuf heures, la nuit menaçait d’être glaciale, car des brumes étaient montées de la Meuse, cachant les étoiles. Et Maurice, couché près de Jean, au pied d’une haie, frissonna, en disant qu’on ferait bien d’aller s’allonger sous la tente. Mais, brisés, plus courbaturés encore, depuis le repos qu’ils avaient pris, ni l’un ni l’autre ne pouvait dormir. À côté d’eux, ils enviaient le lieutenant Rochas, qui, dédaigneux de tout abri, simplement enveloppé d’une couverture, ronflait en héros, sur la terre humide. Longtemps, ensuite, ils s’intéressèrent à la petite flamme d’une bougie, qui brûlait dans une grande tente, où veillaient le colonel et quelques officiers. Toute la soirée, M. de Vineuil avait paru très inquiet de ne pas recevoir d’ordre, pour le lendemain matin. Il sentait son régiment en l’air, trop en avant, bien qu’il eût reculé déjà, abandonnant le poste avancé, occupé le matin. Le général Bourgain-Desfeuilles n’avait pas paru, malade, disait-on, couché à l’hôtel de la Croix d’Or ; et le colonel dut se décider à lui envoyer un officier, pour l’avertir que la nouvelle position paraissait dangereuse, dans l’éparpillement du 7e corps, forcé de défendre une ligne trop étendue, de la boucle de la Meuse au bois de la Garenne. Certainement, dès le jour, la bataille serait livrée. On n’avait plus devant soi que sept ou huit heures de ce grand calme noir. Maurice fut tout étonné, comme la petite clarté s’éteignait dans la tente du colonel, de voir le capitaine Beaudoin passer près de lui, le long de la haie, d’un pas furtif, et disparaître vers Sedan.","It was nine o'clock, the night threatened to be freezing, for mists had risen from the Meuse, hiding the stars. And Maurice, lying near Jean, at the foot of a hedge, shivered, saying that we had better go and lie down in the tent. But, broken, more sore still, since the rest they had taken, neither of them could sleep. Beside them, they envied Lieutenant Rochas, who, disdainful of any shelter, simply wrapped in a blanket, snored like a hero on the damp earth. For a long time afterwards they were interested in the little flame of a candle, which was burning in a large tent, where the colonel and a few officers were watching. All evening M. de Vineuil had seemed very worried at not receiving any orders for the next morning. He felt his regiment in the air, too far forward, although he had already fallen back, abandoning the advanced post occupied in the morning. General Bourgain-Desfeuilles had not appeared, ill, it was said, slept at the Hotel de la Croix d'Or; and the colonel had to decide to send him an officer, to warn him that the new position seemed dangerous, in the scattering of the 7th corps, forced to defend a line that was too long, from the loop of the Meuse to the Bois de la Garenne. . Certainly, from the day the battle would be fought. We had only seven or eight hours of this great dark calm ahead of us. Maurice was quite astonished, as the little light was extinguished in the colonel's tent, to see Captain Beaudoin pass near him, along the hedge, with a furtive step, and disappear towards Sedan.","By now it was nine, and the night looked like being bitterly cold, for the mists had risen off the Meuse, hiding the stars. Maurice, lying beside Jean under a hedge, shivered and said they would do well to go and lie down in the tent. But neither of them could get to sleep, for since the rest they had had they were more tired and aching than ever. They envied Lieutenant Rochas near them who, scorning any cover, and simply wrapped in a blanket, was snoring like an old campaigner on the wet ground. Then for a long time they watched with interest the little candle flame burning in a large tent where the colonel and some officers were sitting up late. All the evening Monsieur de Vineuil had looked very worried because he had had no orders for the following morning. He felt his regiment was exposed too far forward, although he had already drawn back and abandoned the forward outpost occupied that morning. General Bourgain-Desfeuilles had not been seen – he was said to be ill in bed at the Hôtel de la Croix d’Or, and the colonel had to decide to send an officer to warn him that the new position looked dangerous, the 7th corps being so spread out because it was obliged to defend too long a line from the loop of the Meuse to the Garenne woods. It was certain that the battle would begin with the daylight, so there were not more than seven or eight hours of this great black calm left. Maurice was very surprised to see, as the little glimmer of light in the colonel’s tent went out, Captain Beaudoin pass quite close to him, skirting the hedge with furtive steps, and disappear in the direction of Sedan.","It was nine o'clock, with promise of a chilly, uncomfortable night, for a dense mist had risen from the surface of the river, so that the stars were no longer visible. Maurice shivered, where he lay with Jean beneath a hedge, and said they would do better to go and seek the shelter of the tent; the rest they had taken that day had left them wakeful, their joints seemed stiffer and their bones sorer than before; neither could sleep. They envied Lieutenant Rochas, who, stretched on the damp ground and wrapped in his blanket, was snoring like a trooper, not far away. For a long time after that they watched with interest the feeble light of a candle that was burning in a large tent where the colonel and some officers were in consultation. All that evening M. de Vineuil had manifested great uneasiness that he had received no instructions to guide him in the morning. He felt that his regiment was too much “in the air,” too much advanced, although it had already fallen back from the exposed position that it had occupied earlier in the day. Nothing had been seen of General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, who was said to be ill in bed at the Hotel of the Golden Cross, and the colonel decided to send one of his officers to advise him of the danger of their new position in the too extended line of the 7th corps, which had to cover the long stretch from the bend in the Meuse to the wood of la Garenne. There could be no doubt that the enemy would attack with the first glimpse of daylight; only for seven or eight hours now would that deep tranquillity remain unbroken. And shortly after the dim light in the colonel's tent was extinguished Maurice was amazed to see Captain Beaudoin glide by, keeping close to the hedge, with furtive steps, and vanish in the direction of Sedan."
"Il pouvait être neuf heures et demie. La lueur rouge, qui incendiait le ciel, grandissait toujours. À l’est, le vol de petits nuages ensanglantés s’était perdu, il ne restait au zénith qu’un tas d’encre, où se reflétaient les flammes lointaines. Maintenant, toute la ligne de l’horizon était en feu ; mais, par endroits, on distinguait des foyers plus intenses, des gerbes d’un pourpre vif, dont le jaillissement continu rayait les ténèbres, au milieu de grandes fumées volantes. Et l’on aurait dit que les incendies marchaient, que quelque forêt géante s’allumait là-bas, d’arbre en arbre, que la terre elle-même allait flamber, embrasée par ce colossal bûcher de Paris.","It could have been nine-thirty. The red glow, which set the sky on fire, grew ever larger. To the east, the flight of small bloody clouds was lost, only a heap of ink remained in the zenith, where the distant flames were reflected. Now the whole line of the horizon was on fire; but, in places, one could distinguish more intense fires, sheaves of a vivid purple, whose continuous gush streaked the darkness, in the midst of great flying smoke. And one would have said that the fires were going on, that some giant forest was kindling over there, from tree to tree, that the earth itself was about to go up in flames, set ablaze by this colossal pyre of Paris.","It must have been about half past nine. The red glow in the sky was still spreading. In the east the flight of little bloodstained clouds had gone and the vault was simply a wall of ink on which distant flames were reflected. Now the whole line of the horizon was ablaze, but in certain places more intense fires could be seen, bright red fountains playing continuously against the dark background of the great billows of smoke. It looked as though the fires themselves were on the move like some gigantic forest with the flames leaping from tree to tree, or as though the earth itself was about to flare up, kindled by the colossal bonfire of Paris.","It was in the neighborhood of ten o'clock. The fierce red glare that lit the southern sky was ever mounting higher. The blood-red clouds had disappeared from where they had floated in the east; the zenith was like a great inverted bowl of inky blackness, across which ran the reflections of the distant flames. The horizon was one unbroken line of fire, but to the right they could distinguish spots where the conflagration was raging with greater fury, sending up great spires and pinnacles of flame, of the most vivid scarlet, to pierce the dense opacity above, amid billowing clouds of smoke. It was like the burning of some great forest, where the fire bridges intervening space, and leaps from tree to tree; one would have said the very earth must be calcined and reduced to ashes beneath the heat of Paris' gigantic funeral pyre."
"Il s’avançait, menaçant.","He advanced, menacing.",He advanced menacingly.,He came forward threateningly.
"Pendant l’agonie du capitaine, la canonnade semblait avoir augmenté encore, un deuxième obus était tombé dans le jardin, brisant un des arbres centenaires. Des gens affolés criaient que tout Sedan brûlait, un incendie considérable s’étant déclaré dans le faubourg de la Cassine. C’était la fin de tout, si ce bombardement continuait longtemps avec une pareille violence.","During the captain's agony, the cannonade seemed to have increased still more, a second shell had fallen in the garden, breaking one of the hundred-year-old trees. Terrified people shouted that the whole of Sedan was burning, a considerable fire having broken out in the Faubourg de la Cassine. It would be the end of everything, if this bombardment continued long with such violence.","During the death agony of the captain the bombardment seemed to have got still worse, and a second shell had come down in the garden and had snapped one of the century-old trees. Terrified people were screaming that the whole of Sedan was on fire, and indeed a major fire had broken out in the Cassine district. It was the end of everything if this bombardment went on with such violence for long.","While the captain lay dying the cannonade seemed, if that were possible, to have increased in violence; another shell had landed in the garden, shattering one of the old elms. Terror-stricken men came running in to say that all Sedan was in danger of destruction; a great fire had broken out in the Faubourg de la Cassine. If the bombardment should continue with such fury for any length of time there would be nothing left of the city."
"Et, très haut, elle se décida à crier sa marchandise : « Du pain ! du pain ! qui achète du pain ? » Mais, quand Maurice voulut lui glisser vingt francs, elle retira la main d’un geste brusque, elle se sauva, après leur avoir laissé le panier. Ils la virent pourtant qui se retournait encore, qui leur jetait le rire tendre et ému de ses beaux yeux.","And, very loudly, she decided to shout her wares: ""Bread!"" bread ! who buys bread? But when Maurice wanted to slip her twenty francs, she withdrew her hand with a sudden gesture and ran away, after leaving them the basket. They saw her, however, turning round again, giving them the tender and moved laughter of her beautiful eyes.","Then she made up her mind to cry her wares very loud: ‘Bread! Bread! Who wants to buy bread?’ But when Maurice tried to slip her twenty francs she quickly drew back her hand and ran off, leaving the basket behind. But they saw her look back and give them an affectionate and deeply concerned smile with her beautiful eyes.","Then she began to cry her merchandise aloud: “Bread! bread! who'll buy my bread?” But when Maurice would have slipped a twenty-franc piece into her fingers she drew back her hand abruptly and ran away, leaving the basket with them.

Ils étaient tellement brisés, tellement éperdus de fatigue et de désespoir, qu’ils n’avaient pu aller plus loin, tombés contre un mur.","But for a moment Henriette had found herself distracted in her haste to advance. She had just recognized, stranded by the side of the road, a whole family from Bazeilles, poor weavers, the husband, the wife, with three daughters, the eldest of whom was only nine years old. They were so broken, so desperate with fatigue and despair, that they couldn't go any further, falling against a wall.","But for a moment Henriette had had her mind taken off her hurry to get on. She had recognized a Bazeilles family stranded there at the roadside, a family of poor weavers, the man and wife and three girls, the eldest of whom was only nine. They were so shattered and dazed with exhaustion and despair that they could go no further and had collapsed by a wall.","But Henriette, meantime, had made an encounter that caused her to forget her project for a moment. In some poor outcasts; stranded by the wayside, she had recognized a family of honest weavers from Bazeilles, father, mother, and three little girls, of whom the largest was only nine years old. They were utterly disheartened and forlorn, and so weary and footsore that they could go no further, and had thrown themselves down at the foot of a wall. “Alas!"
"Et, sur une nouvelle question de Maurice, il dit leur débarquement à Toulon, leur long et pénible voyage jusqu’à Lunéville. C’était là qu’ils avaient appris Wissembourg et Frœschwiller. Ensuite, il ne savait plus, confondait les villes : de Nancy à Saint-Mihiel, de Saint-Mihiel à Metz. Le 14, il devait y avoir eu une grande bataille, l’horizon était en feu ; mais lui n’avait vu que quatre uhlans, derrière une haie. Le 16, on s’était battu encore, le canon faisait rage dès six heures du matin ; et on lui avait dit que, le 18, la danse avait recommencé, plus terrible. Seulement, les chasseurs n’étaient plus là, parce que, le 16, à Gravelotte, comme ils attendaient d’entrer en ligne, le long d’une route, l’empereur, qui filait dans une calèche, les avait pris en passant, pour l’accompagner à Verdun. Une jolie trotte, quarante-deux kilomètres au galop, avec la peur, à chaque instant, d’être coupés par les Prussiens !","And, on a new question from Maurice, he tells of their landing at Toulon, their long and painful journey to Lunéville. It was there that they had learned Wissembourg and Frœschwiller. Then, he no longer knew, confused the towns: from Nancy to Saint-Mihiel, from Saint-Mihiel to Metz. On the 14th there must have been a great battle, the horizon was on fire; but he had only seen four uhlans, behind a hedge. On the 16th, we had fought again, the guns were raging from six o'clock in the morning; and he had been told that on the 18th the dance had begun again, more terrible. Only the chasseurs were no longer there because, on the 16th, at Gravelotte, as they were waiting to line up along a road, the Emperor, who was speeding by in a carriage, had caught them as they passed. , to accompany him to Verdun. A pretty trot, forty-two kilometers at a gallop, with the constant fear of being cut off by the Prussians!","Answering a fresh question from Maurice, he told of their disembarking at Toulon and long and difficult journey to Lunéville, where they had heard about Wissembourg and Froeschwiller. After that he wasn’t sure, he got the towns all mixed up: from Nancy to Saint-Mihiel, from Saint-Mihiel to Metz. On the 14th there must have been a big battle, the horizon was on fire, but all he had seen was four Uhlans behind a hedge. On the 16th more fighting and heavy gunfire from six in the morning, and he had been told that on the 18th the dance had started up again, more terrible still. But the Chasseurs weren’t there then because on the 16th, while they were waiting by the roadside at Gravelotte to go up to the line, the Emperor, tearing off in his carriage, had picked them up to escort him to Verdun. A nice ride that was, forty-two kilometres at the gallop for fear of being cut off by the Prussians at every moment.","And in reply to a question asked by Maurice, he told the story of their landing at Toulon and the long and wearisome march to Luneville. It was there that they first received news of Wissembourg and Froeschwiller. After that his account was less clear, for he got the names of towns mixed, Nancy and Saint-Mihiel, Saint-Mihiel and Metz. There must have been heavy fighting on the 14th, for the sky was all on fire, but all he saw of it was four uhlans behind a hedge. On the 16th there was another engagement; they could hear the artillery going as early as six o'clock in the morning, and he had been told that on the 18th they started the dance again, more lively than ever. But the chasseurs were not in it that time, for at Gravelotte on the 16th, as they were standing drawn up along a road waiting to wheel into column, the Emperor, who passed that way in a victoria, took them to act as his escort to Verdun. And a pretty little jaunt it was, twenty-six miles at a hard gallop, with the fear of being cut off by the Prussians at any moment!"
"Maurice venait d’avoir conscience de l’irréparable faute qu’on avait commise, en ne se retirant pas sur Mézières, pendant la nuit. Mais, pour lui, les conséquences restaient confuses. Seul, un sourd instinct du danger lui faisait regarder avec inquiétude les hauteurs voisines, qui dominaient le plateau de l’Algérie. Si l’on n’avait pas eu le temps de battre en retraite, pourquoi ne s’était-on pas décidé à occuper ces hauteurs, en s’adossant contre la frontière, quitte à passer en Belgique, dans le cas où l’on serait culbuté ? Deux points surtout semblaient menaçants, le mamelon du Hattoy, au-dessus de Floing, à gauche, et le calvaire d’Illy, une croix de pierre entre deux tilleuls, à droite. La veille, le général Douay avait fait occuper le Hattoy par un régiment, qui, dès le petit jour, s’était replié, trop en l’air. Quant au calvaire d’Illy, il devait être défendu par l’aile gauche du 1er corps. Les terres s’étendaient entre Sedan et la forêt des Ardennes, vastes et nues, profondément vallonnées ; et la clef de la position était visiblement là, au pied de cette croix et de ces deux tilleuls, d’où l’on balayait toute la contrée environnante.","Maurice had just become aware of the irreparable fault they had committed in not withdrawing to Mézières during the night. But, for him, the consequences remained confused. Alone, a dull instinct of danger made him gaze uneasily at the neighboring heights, which overlooked the plateau of Algeria. If we hadn't had time to beat a retreat, why hadn't we decided to occupy these heights, leaning against the border, even if it meant crossing into Belgium, in case the would we be knocked over? Two points above all seemed threatening, the hillock of Hattoy, above Floing, on the left, and the Calvary of Illy, a stone cross between two lime trees, on the right. The day before, General Douay had occupied Hattoy by a regiment, which, at daybreak, had fallen back, too much in the air. As for the ordeal of Illy, it was to be defended by the left wing of the 1st corps. The land stretched between Sedan and the forest of the Ardennes, vast and bare, deeply undulating; and the key to the position was visibly there, at the foot of this cross and these two lime trees, whence one swept all the surrounding country.","That was when Maurice fully realized the irreparable mistake that had been made in not falling back on Mézières during the night. But the consequences were not yet quite clear to him. It simply was that some deep instinct of danger made him glance anxiously at the neighbouring heights overlooking the plateau of Algérie. If they hadn’t had time to effect a retreat, then why hadn’t they decided to occupy those heights backing on to the frontier so that they could go into Belgium if they were thrown back? Two points looked especially menacing, the round hilltop of Le Hattoy, above Floing to the left, and the Calvary of Illy, a stone cross between two lime trees on the right. On the previous day General Douay had put a regiment in occupation on Le Hattoy, but being too exposed it was withdrawn at dusk. As for the Calvary of Illy, it was to be defended by the left wing of the 1st corps. The land extending between Sedan and the Ardennes was a vast expanse of bare earth, deeply indented with valleys, and the key to the position was obviously there, at the foot of that cross and those two lime trees, from which the whole of the surrounding country could be raked by gunfire.","Maurice suddenly perceived the enormity of their blunder in not retreating on Mezieres during the night; but as yet the consequences were not clear to him; he could not foresee all the disaster that was to result from that fatal error of judgment. Moved by some indefinable instinct of danger, he looked with apprehension on the adjacent heights that commanded the plateau de l'Algerie. If time had not been allowed them to make good their retreat, why had they not backed up against the frontier and occupied those heights of Illy and Saint-Menges, whence, if they could not maintain their position, they would at least have been free to cross over into Belgium? There were two points that appeared to him especially threatening, the mamelon of Hattoy, to the north of Floing on the left, and the Calvary of Illy, a stone cross with a linden tree on either side, the highest bit of ground in the surrounding country, to the right. General Douay was keenly alive to the importance of these eminences, and the day before had sent two battalions to occupy Hattoy; but the men, feeling that they were “in the air” and too remote from support, had fallen back early that morning. It was understood that the left wing of the 1st corps was to take care of the Calvary of Illy. The wide expanse of naked country between Sedan and the Ardennes forest was intersected by deep ravines, and the key of the position was manifestly there, in the shadow of that cross and the two lindens, whence their guns might sweep the fields in every direction for a long distance."
"– Non, quelle trouvaille ? demanda gaiement Gilberte, en tournant vers le jeune sergent ses jolis yeux de caresse.","– No, what discovery? asked Gilberte gaily, turning her pretty caressing eyes towards the young sergeant.","‘No, what?’ Gilberte gaily asked, turning her pretty, beaming eyes on the young sergeant.","“No; what discovery?” asked Gilberte, turning her pretty caressing eyes full on the young sergeant."
"Mais la nouvelle, maintenant, courait, certaine. On ne se repliait plus sur Paris, on marchait de nouveau vers la Meuse. Un aide de camp du maréchal venait d’apporter au 7e corps l’ordre d’aller camper à Nouart ; tandis que le 5e, se dirigeant sur Beauclair, prendrait la droite de l’armée, et que le 1er remplacerait au Chesne le 12e, en marche sur la Besace, à l’aile gauche. Et, si, depuis près de trois heures, trente et quelques mille hommes restaient là, l’arme au pied, à attendre, sous les furieuses rafales, c’était que le général Douay, au milieu de la confusion déplorable de ce nouveau changement de front, éprouvait l’inquiétude la plus vive sur le sort du convoi, envoyé en avant, la veille, vers Chagny. Il fallait bien attendre qu’il eût rallié le corps. On racontait que ce convoi avait été coupé par celui du 12e corps, au Chesne. D’autre part, une partie du matériel, toutes les forges d’artillerie, s’étant trompées de route, revenaient de Terron par la route de Vouziers, où elles allaient sûrement tomber entre les mains des Allemands. Jamais désordre ne fut plus grand, et jamais anxiété plus vive.","But the news, now, was circulating, certain. We were no longer falling back on Paris, we were marching again towards the Meuse. An aide-de-camp to the marshal had just brought the order to the 7th corps to encamp at Nouart; while the 5th, moving on Beauclair, would take the right of the army, and the 1st would replace at Chesne the 12th, marching on the Besace, on the left wing. And if, for nearly three hours, thirty-some thousand men remained there, arms at their feet, waiting, under the furious gusts, it was because General Douay, in the midst of the deplorable confusion of this new change abreast, felt the liveliest anxiety about the fate of the convoy, sent forward the day before towards Chagny. It was necessary to wait until he had joined the corps. It was said that this convoy had been cut off by that of the 12th Corps at Le Chesne. On the other hand, part of the equipment, all the artillery forges, having taken the wrong road, were returning from Terron by the road to Vouziers, where they were surely going to fall into the hands of the Germans. Never was disorder greater, and never anxiety greater.","By now the news was going round, and it was official. The retreat to Paris was off, and once again they were marching towards the Meuse. An aide-de-camp from the marshal had just brought orders for the 7th corps to go and camp at Nouart, whilst the 5th, heading for Beauclair, would take the right flank and the 1st would replace at Le Chêne the 12th, which was marching on La Besace, on the left wing. The reason why thirty-odd thousand men had been standing about there waiting in the furious gales for three hours was that General Douay, in all the deplorable muddle of this fresh change of plan, was terribly worried about the whereabouts of the baggage train sent on ahead the day before towards Chagny. They had to wait until it had rejoined the main body. It was being said that this convoy had been cut in half by that of the 12th at Le Chêne. On top of that, part of the equipment – all the smithies for the artillery – having taken the wrong road was now on its way back from Terron via the Vouziers road, where it was certain to fall into German hands. Never had there been a greater muddle, nor more anxiety.","And now the tidings became more definite and spread among the men; they were no longer retreating on Paris; the advance to the Meuse was again the order of the day. An aide-de-camp had brought to the 7th corps instructions from the marshal to go and encamp at Nonart; the 5th was to take the direction of Beauclair, where it would be the right wing of the army, while the 1st was to move up to Chene and relieve the 12th, then on the march to la Besace on the extreme left. And the reason why more than thirty thousand men had been kept waiting there at ordered arms, for nearly three hours in the midst of a blinding storm, was that General Douay, in the deplorable confusion incident on this new change of front, was alarmed for the safety of the train that had been sent forward the day before toward Chagny; the delay was necessary to give the several divisions time to close up. In the confusion of all these conflicting movements it was said that the 12th corps train had blocked the road at Chene, thus cutting off that of the 7th. On the other hand, an important part of the materiel, all the forges of the artillery, had mistaken their road and strayed off in the direction of Terron; they were now trying to find their way back by the Vouziers road, where they were certain to fall into the hands of the Germans. Never was there such utter confusion, never was anxiety so intense."
"– Dites donc, ils en ont fait une histoire, pour ces deux uhlans qu’ils ont ramassés sans tête, près de Villecourt… Vous savez que Villecourt brûle depuis hier : une sentence, comme ils disent, qu’ils ont portée contre le village, pour le punir de vous avoir accueillis… Faut être prudent, vous savez, et ne pas revenir tout de suite. On vous portera le pain là-bas.","– Say, they made a story out of it, for these two uhlans they picked up headless, near Villecourt… You know that Villecourt has been burning since yesterday: a sentence, as they say, that they brought against the village , to punish him for welcoming you… You have to be careful, you know, and not come back right away. We'll bring you the bread there.","‘By the way, they’ve made quite a thing of those two Uhlans they picked up near Villecourt, with their heads chopped off… You know Villecourt’s been on fire since yesterday, what they call a sentence on the village to punish them for harbouring you … Must be careful, you know, and don’t you come back here too soon. We’ll deliver your bread elsewhere.’","Then, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand: “Say, have you heard of the fuss they're making over the two headless uhlans that they picked up over there near Villecourt? Villecourt was burned yesterday, you know; they say it was the penalty the village had to pay for harboring you. You'll have to be prudent, don't you see, and not show yourselves about here for a time. I'll see the bread is sent you somewhere.”"
"– Allons, dit Jean, c’est notre tour.","- Come on, said Jean, it's our turn.","‘Here we come,’ said Jean.","“Our turn is coming now,” said Jean."
"– On ne peut pas manger tranquille ! cria brusquement le général. Qu’est-ce qu’ils ont à brailler comme ça ?… Allez donc voir, l’Alsacien !","- We can't eat in peace! suddenly shouted the general. Why are they bawling like that? Go and see, the Alsatian!","‘You can’t eat in peace!’ the general shouted. ‘What are they yapping like that for? Go and find out, you.’","“It's too bad that a man can't eat his dinner in peace!” the general suddenly blurted out. “What does all that uproar mean? Go and see what the matter is, you Alsatian fellow!”"
"Elle était tombée à genoux, sur la terre détrempée, les mains jointes, dans un élan de folle douleur. Ce mot d’ami, qu’elle trouvait seul, disait la tendresse qu’elle venait de perdre, cet homme si bon qui lui avait pardonné, qui consentait à faire d’elle sa femme, malgré tout. Maintenant, c’était la fin de son espoir, elle ne vivrait plus. Jamais elle n’en avait aimé un autre, et elle l’aimerait toujours. La pluie cessait, un vol de corbeaux qui tournoyait en croassant au-dessus des trois arbres, l’inquiétait comme une menace. Est-ce qu’on voulait le lui reprendre, ce cher mort si péniblement retrouvé ? Elle s’était traînée sur les genoux, elle chassait, d’une main tremblante, les mouches voraces bourdonnant au-dessus des deux yeux grands ouverts, dont elle cherchait encore le regard.","She had fallen to her knees, on the sodden earth, her hands clasped, in a surge of mad pain. This word friend, which she found alone, spoke of the tenderness she had just lost, this man so good who had forgiven her, who consented to make her his wife, in spite of everything. Now was the end of her hope, she would live no more. She had never loved another, and she always would. The rain was stopping, a flock of crows circling and cawing above the three trees worried him like a threat. Did they want to take it back from him, this dear dead so painfully found? She had dragged herself on her knees, she was chasing away, with a trembling hand, the voracious flies buzzing above the two wide-open eyes, whose gaze she was still seeking.","She fell on her knees on the wet ground and joined her hands in a spasm of wild grief. This word darling, the only one she could find, expressed the love she had lost, this man who in his goodness had forgiven her and consented to take her for his wife in spite of everything. Now her hope was at an end and she would cease to be really alive. She had never loved another and would love him for ever. The rain was giving over, and a flight of crows cawing above the three trees frightened her like some evil menace. Was her beloved dead, recovered with such difficulty, to be taken from her again? She dragged herself over on her knees and with a trembling hand drove away the greedy flies buzzing above the wide open eyes she still hoped would look at her.","She had fallen to her knees on the damp, cold ground, her hands joined as if in prayer, in an outburst of frantic grief. The word friend, the only name by which it occurred to her to address him, told the story of the tender affection she had lost in that man, so good, so loving, who had forgiven her, had meant to make her his wife, despite the ugly past. And now all hope was dead within her bosom, there was nothing left to make life desirable. She had never loved another; she would put away her love for him at the bottom of her heart and hold it sacred there. The rain had ceased; a flock of crows that circled above the three trees, croaking dismally, affected her like a menace of evil. Was he to be taken from her again, her cherished dead, whom she had recovered with such difficulty? She dragged herself along upon her knees, and with a trembling hand brushed away the hungry flies that were buzzing about her friend's wide-open eyes."
"Pourquoi ne vaincrait-on pas, maintenant qu’on se battait ? Et Maurice, et tous les autres, s’enrageaient, brûlaient leur poudre, à fusiller le bois lointain, où tombait une pluie lente et silencieuse de petites branches.","Why shouldn't we win, now that we were fighting? And Maurice, and all the others, were enraged, burning their gunpowder, shooting the distant wood, where a slow and silent rain of small branches was falling.","Why shouldn’t they win now that they were fighting? Maurice and all the others went mad and fired as though to kill the distant wood, in which a slow silent rain of twigs came down.","And why, now that the day of battle had arrived, should not victory perch upon that banner? With that reflection Maurice and his companions kept on industriously wasting their powder on the distant wood, producing havoc there among the leaves and twigs."
"– Ah ! mon enfant, dans quel affreux moment faut-il qu’on se retrouve !… Je la lui aurais donnée bien volontiers, ma maison, à l’empereur ; mais il a, avec lui, des gens trop mal élevés !

I would have gladly given it to him, my house, to the Emperor; but he has with him people who are too badly brought up!

He, the poor man, looks like someone who has been dug up and looks so sad...","‘Oh my child, what a dreadful time to meet again! I would gladly have given up my house to the Emperor, but some of the people with him really are too uncouth!

I would cheerfully have surrendered my house to the Emperor, but the people he has about him have no sense of decency.

He, poor man, looks like a corpse, and such sadness in his face—”"
"– C’était sûr, murmura Rochas. Ça ne vaut rien de tant remuer, et ce qu’on doit gober, on le gobe.","“It was sure,” murmured Rochas. It is worth nothing to stir so much, and what one must swallow, one swallows it.","‘It was bound to happen,’ muttered Rochas. ‘It’s no good fidgeting about so much.","“He might have known as much,” Rochas muttered. “There's no use his making such a fuss over it; when the dose is fixed for one, he has to take it.”"
"– Silvine, sans vous commander, je voudrais bien avoir un baquet.","– Silvine, without commanding you, I would like to have a tub.","‘Silvine, I’m not giving you orders, but I should like to have a wash-tub.’","“Silvine, if it's not troubling you too much, I would like to have a tub.”"
"La nuit était complètement venue, une nuit claire, au beau ciel étoilé ; et Maurice et Jean, qui avaient gagné leur petit bois, ne virent bientôt plus que Lapoulle, rôdant le long de la Meuse. Les deux autres avaient disparu, retournés sans doute au bord du canal, inquiets de ce corps qu’ils laissaient derrière eux. Lui, au contraire, semblait craindre d’aller là-bas, rejoindre les camarades. Après l’étourdissement du meurtre, alourdi par la digestion du gros morceau de pain avalé trop vite, il était évidemment saisi d’une angoisse, qui le faisait s’agiter, n’osant reprendre la route que barrait le cadavre, piétinant sans fin sur la berge, d’un pas vacillant d’irrésolution. Le remords s’éveillait-il, au fond de cette âme obscure ? ou bien n’était-ce que la terreur d’être découvert ? Il allait et venait ainsi qu’une bête devant les barreaux de sa cage, avec un besoin subit et grandissant de fuir, un besoin douloureux comme un mal physique, dont il sentait qu’il mourrait, s’il ne le contentait pas. Au galop, au galop, il lui fallait sortir tout de suite de cette prison où il venait de tuer. Pourtant, il s’affaissa, il resta longtemps vautré parmi les herbes de la rive.","The night had come completely, a clear night, with a beautiful starry sky; and Maurice and Jean, who had reached their little wood, soon saw only Lapoulle prowling along the Meuse. The other two had disappeared, no doubt returned to the edge of the canal, worried about the body they left behind. He, on the contrary, seemed afraid to go there, to join the comrades. After the stun of the murder, weighed down by the digestion of the large piece of bread swallowed too quickly, he was obviously seized with an anguish, which made him agitate, not daring to take the road blocked by the corpse, trampling endlessly on the bank, with a wavering step of irresolution. Was remorse awakening in the depths of this obscure soul? or was it only the terror of being discovered? He came and went like an animal before the bars of its cage, with a sudden and growing need to flee, a painful need like a physical illness, of which he felt he would die if he did not satisfy it. At a gallop, at a gallop, he had to get out immediately of this prison where he had just killed. However, he sank, he remained for a long time wallowing among the grasses of the bank.","The real night had come, but it was a bright night with a beautiful starlit sky, and Maurice and Jean, who had come back to their copse, could now only see Lapoulle prowling to and fro along the Meuse. The two others had gone, no doubt back to the canal towpath, worried about the body they had left behind. But Lapoulle seemed afraid to go back there and rejoin his mates. Clearly what with the shock of the murder and the heavy discomfort after bolting the big hunk of bread too fast, he was overcome with uneasiness, and that kept him on the move but he did not dare to go back along the path blocked by the corpse, hesitating, unable to make up his mind. Was it remorse awakening in his muddled soul, or merely fear of being discovered? So he roamed up and down like an animal behind the bars of its cage, with a sudden, growing urge to run away, an urge that hurt like a physical pain which he felt would kill him if he did not satisfy it. He must run, run at once and get away from this prison in which he had killed a man. But he threw himself down and for a long time he stayed there cowering in the grass on the river bank.","By this time night had fallen, a pleasant night with a clear sky thick-set with stars, and Maurice and Jean, who had regained the shelter of their little wood, presently perceived Lapoulle wandering up and down the river bank. The two others had vanished, had doubtless returned to the encampment by the canal, their mind troubled by reason of the corpse they left behind them. He, on the other hand, seemed to dread going to rejoin the comrades. When he was more himself and his brutish, sluggish intellect showed him the full extent of his crime, he had evidently experienced a twinge of anguish that made motion a necessity, and not daring to return to the interior of the peninsula, where he would have to face the body of his victim, had sought the bank of the stream, where he was now tramping to and fro with uneven, faltering steps. What was going on within the recesses of that darkened mind that guided the actions of that creature, so degraded as to be scarce higher than the animal? Was it the awakening of remorse? or only the fear lest his crime might be discovered? He could not remain there; he paced his beat as a wild beast shambles up and down its cage, with a sudden and ever-increasing longing to fly, a longing that ached and pained like a physical hurt, from which he felt he should die, could he do nothing to satisfy it. Quick, quick, he must fly, must fly at once, from that prison where he had slain a fellow-being. And yet, the coward in him, it may be, gaining the supremacy, he threw himself on the ground, and for a long time lay crouched among the herbage."
"Lorsque tous les trois revinrent, cachant la bête dans un sac, avec les pommes de terre, ils trouvèrent Jean et Pache, qui rentraient, heureux également de leur expédition, chargés de quatre pains frais et d’un fromage, achetés chez une vieille brave femme.","When all three returned, hiding the animal in a sack, with the potatoes, they found Jean and Pache, who were returning, equally happy with their expedition, laden with four fresh loaves of bread and a cheese, bought from a brave old woman. woman.","When the three got back, hiding the beast in a sack with the potatoes, they found Jean and Pache just coming back and equally pleased with their expedition, carrying four loaves and a cheese they had bought from some nice old girl. ‘The water’s boiling, we’ll make some coffee,’ said the corporal.","When they got back to camp, with the unfortunate gander and the potatoes hidden in a bag, they found that Jean and Pache had also been successful in their expedition, and had enriched the common larder with four loaves of fresh bread and a cheese that they had purchased from a worthy old woman."
"– Ah ! murmura Silvine, les yeux vers le corps d’Honoré, bouleversée de ce qu’elle voyait, les morts peut-être sont plus heureux !","– Ah! murmured Silvine, her eyes fixed on Honoré's body, overwhelmed by what she saw, perhaps the dead are happier!","‘Ah’, murmured Silvine, glancing towards Honoré’s body and distressed at what she saw, ‘perhaps the dead are happiest!’","“Ah!” murmured Silvine, distressed by what she had just seen, fixing her eyes on Honore's body, “it may be that the dead have the better part!”"
"Quand les Prussiens furent partis, le père Fouchard haussa les épaules, avec un ricanement d’infini dédain. Des bêtes crevées, bien sûr qu’il leur en vendait, il ne leur faisait même manger que de ça ! Toutes les charognes que les paysans lui apportaient, ce qui mourait de maladie et ce qu’il ramassait dans les fossés, est-ce que ce n’était pas bon pour ces sales bougres ?","When the Prussians had left, Father Fouchard shrugged his shoulders with a sneer of infinite disdain. Dead animals, of course he sold them, he only made them eat that! All the carrion that the peasants brought him, what died of disease and what he picked up in the ditches, wasn't that good for those filthy buggers?","When the Prussians had gone old Fouchard shrugged his shoulders and sneered with infinite contempt. Cattle that had died of disease, well of course that’s what he sold them, that’s what he made them eat, and nothing else! All the corpses the peasants brought him that had died of diseases and the ones he picked up himself in the ditches – wasn’t that good enough for those filthy bastards?","When the Prussians were gone Father Fouchard shrugged his shoulders with a contemptuous sneer. Why, yes, of course he sold them carcasses that had never been near the slaughter house; that was all they would ever get to eat from him. If a peasant had a cow die on his hands of the rinderpest, or if he found a dead ox lying in the ditch, was not the carrion good enough for those dirty Prussians? To say nothing of the pleasure there was in getting a big price out of them for tainted meat at which a dog would turn up his nose."
"Des minutes durent s’écouler, il fut à peine surpris, en apercevant soudain Henriette. Rien n’était plus naturel, son frère était mourant, elle arrivait. Il ne l’avait pas même vue entrer, peut-être se trouvait-elle là depuis des heures. Maintenant, affaissé sur une chaise, il la regardait stupidement s’agiter, sous le coup de mortelle douleur qui l’avait frappée, à la vue de son frère sans connaissance, couvert de sang. Il finit par avoir un souvenir, il demanda :","Minutes must have passed, he was hardly surprised when he suddenly saw Henriette. Nothing was more natural, her brother was dying, she was coming. He hadn't even seen her come in, maybe she had been there for hours. Now, slumped in a chair, he looked at her stupidly tossing about, under the mortal pain that had struck her, at the sight of her unconscious brother, covered in blood. He ended up having a memory, he asked:","Some minutes must have gone by and he was scarcely surprised when he saw Henriette. Nothing was more natural, her brother was dying and she had come. He had not even noticed her come in, and she might have been there for hours. Now he slumped into a chair and listlessly watched her as she moved about in mortal grief at the sight of her brother unconscious and covered with blood. At last something came back into his mind and he asked:","Minutes passed; he was hardly surprised when, raising his eyes, he saw Henriette standing by the bed. It was perfectly natural: her brother was dying, she had come. He had not even seen her enter the room; for all he knew she might have been standing there for hours. He sank into a chair and watched her with stupid eyes as she hovered about the bed, her heart wrung with mortal anguish at sight of her brother lying there senseless, in his blood-stained garments. Then his memory began to act again; he asked:"
"Comme les brancardiers, après avoir bandé fortement la jambe, pour la maintenir, emportaient le capitaine assis sur leurs poings noués, un bras passé au cou de chacun d’eux, le colonel de Vineuil, averti, arriva, en poussant son cheval. Il avait connu le jeune homme dès sa sortie de Saint-Cyr, il l’aimait et se montrait très ému.","As the stretcher-bearers, after bandaging the leg tightly to maintain it, carried off the captain, seated on their knotted fists, one arm around the neck of each of them, Colonel de Vineuil, warned, arrived, pushing his horse. He had known the young man as soon as he left Saint-Cyr, he loved him and was very moved.","The ambulance men had bound the leg up tight to hold it in place, and then were carrying the captain on a bandy-chair with his arms round their necks, when Colonel de Vineuil, who had been informed, came up as fast as he could urge his horse. He had known the young man since he graduated from Saint-Cyr and was fond of him, and he was visibly very upset.","The bearers had tightly bandaged the injured limb in order to keep the bones in position and were about to bear the captain off the field on what children call a “chair,” formed by joining their hands and slipping an arm of the patient over each of their necks, when Colonel de Vineuil, who had heard of the accident, came up, spurring his horse. He manifested much emotion, for he had known the young man ever since his graduation from Saint-Cyr."
"– Ah ! oui, crièrent-ils ensemble. En voici une ligne, en voici une autre, une autre, une autre ! Il y en a partout.","– Ah! yes, they shouted together. Here's a line, here's another, another, another! It's everywhere.","‘Oh yes,’ they exclaimed together. ‘There’s one line, and there’s another, and another and another! It’s crawling with them.’","“Yes, yes!” they cried. “There is a line, there is another, and another, and another! They are everywhere.”"
"– Vous trouvez, major ?","""Do you think so, Major?""","‘You think so, major?’","“What were you saying, major?”"

It’s so silly to fight!’","“They are fighting, so early in the morning, mon Dieu! It would be ridiculous if it were not for the horror of it.”"
"– Mais enfin, pourquoi tire-t-on toujours, puisque j’ai fait hisser le drapeau blanc ?","""But after all, why are we still shooting, since I had the white flag hoisted?""","‘But why are they still firing, since I had the white flag run up?’","“I gave orders to raise the white flag; tell me, why do they continue firing?”"
"– Mesdames, ce n’est pas dehors, c’est ici qu’on a besoin de vous !","- Ladies, it's not outside, it's here that we need you!","‘Ladies, it isn’t there you are wanted, but in here!’","A hail, in no gentle terms, was heard proceeding from the courtyard: “Now then, ladies, here is where you are wanted, not outside!”"
"– Allons, au revoir, dit-il en serrant la main de Prosper. Peut-être tout de même qu’on a besoin de vous, là-haut.","“Come, good-bye,” he said, shaking hands with Prosper. Maybe we still need you up there.","‘Oh well, so long,’ he said, shaking Prosper’s hand. ‘Perhaps they’ll still need you up there.’","“Well, then, au revoir,” said he, shaking Prosper by the hand; “perhaps they will find something for you to do down yonder, after all.”"
"D’autres légers bourdonnements d’ailes passèrent. Toute l’escouade tournait la tête, s’intéressait. C’était irrésistible, les hommes renversaient le cou, ne pouvaient rester en place.","More faint hums of wings passed. The whole squad turned their heads, interested. It was irresistible, the men threw back their necks, couldn't stay still.","Other faint buzzings passed over. The whole squad looked round and began to take interest. It was irresistible, the men screwed their necks round and couldn’t keep still.",Again and again the hum of those invisible wings made itself heard. The men craned their necks and looked about them with eager interest; their curiosity was uncontrollable—would not allow them to remain quiet.
"En bas, sur le canapé, Maurice s’éveilla, au petit jour. Courbaturé, il ne bougea pas, les yeux sur les vitres, peu à peu blanchies d’une aube livide. Les abominables souvenirs lui revenaient, la bataille perdue, la fuite, le désastre, dans la lucidité aiguë du réveil. Il revit tout, jusqu’au moindre détail, il souffrit affreusement de la défaite, dont le retentissement descendait aux racines de son être, comme s’il s’en était senti le coupable. Et il raisonnait le mal, s’analysant, retrouvant aiguisée la faculté de se dévorer lui-même. N’était-il pas le premier venu, un des passants de l’époque, certes d’une instruction brillante, mais d’une ignorance crasse en tout ce qu’il aurait fallu savoir, vaniteux avec cela au point d’en être aveugle, perverti par l’impatience de jouir et par la prospérité menteuse du règne ? Puis, c’était une autre évocation : son grand-père, né en 1780, un des héros de la Grande Armée, un des vainqueurs d’Austerlitz, de Wagram et de Friedland ; son père, né en 1811, tombé à la bureaucratie, petit employé médiocre, percepteur au Chesne-Populeux, où il s’était usé ; lui, né en 1841, élevé en monsieur, reçu avocat, capable des pires sottises et des plus grands enthousiasmes, vaincu à Sedan, dans une catastrophe qu’il devinait immense, finissant un monde ; et cette dégénérescence de la race, qui expliquait comment la France victorieuse avec les grands-pères avait pu être battue dans les petits-fils, lui écrasait le cœur, telle qu’une maladie de famille, lentement aggravée, aboutissant à la destruction fatale, quand l’heure avait sonné. Dans la victoire, il se serait senti si brave et triomphant ! Dans la défaite, d’une faiblesse nerveuse de femme, il cédait à un de ces désespoirs immenses, où le monde entier sombrait. Il n’y avait plus rien, la France était morte. Des sanglots l’étouffèrent, il pleura, il joignit les mains, retrouvant les bégaiements de prière de son enfance :","Downstairs, on the sofa, Maurice woke up at daybreak. Ached, he did not move, his eyes on the windows, little by little whitened by a livid dawn. The abominable memories came back to him, the lost battle, the flight, the disaster, in the acute lucidity of awakening. He saw everything again, down to the smallest detail, he suffered terribly from the defeat, the repercussions of which descended to the roots of his being, as if he had felt guilty. And he reasoned evil, analyzing himself, rediscovering sharpened the faculty of devouring himself. Wasn't he the first comer, one of the passers-by of the time, certainly of a brilliant education, but of a filthy ignorance in all that one should have known, vain with that to the point of being blind, perverted by the impatience to enjoy and by the lying prosperity of the kingdom? Then there was another evocation: his grandfather, born in 1780, one of the heroes of the Grande Armée, one of the victors of Austerlitz, Wagram and Friedland; his father, born in 1811, fallen into the bureaucracy, mediocre little employee, tax collector at Chesne-Populeux, where he had worn himself out; he, born in 1841, brought up as a gentleman, accepted as a lawyer, capable of the worst foolishness and the greatest enthusiasm, defeated at Sedan, in a catastrophe which he guessed was immense, ending a world; and this degeneration of the race, which explained how victorious France with the grandfathers had been beaten in the grandsons, crushed his heart, like a family disease, slowly aggravated, ending in fatal destruction, when the hour had struck. In victory, he would have felt so brave and triumphant! In defeat, with the nervous weakness of a woman, he yielded to one of those immense despairs in which the whole world sank. There was nothing left, France was dead. Sobs choked him, he wept, he clasped his hands, rediscovering the prayerful stutters of his childhood:","Down below Maurice woke up on the sofa at daybreak. Aching all over, he lay still and stared at the window gradually lightening in a grey dawn. Horrible memories came back, the lost battle, flight, disaster, all with the sharp clarity of the morning after. He could see it all again in the minutest detail, and the defeat pained him terribly, penetrating to the depths of his being as if he felt personally guilty. He considered his own pain, analysed himself and recovered his old faculty of tearing himself to pieces, but more successfully than ever. Was he not just the ordinary man, the man in the street of the period, highly educated no doubt, but crassly ignorant of all the things that ought to be known, and moreover conceited to the point of blindness, perverted by the lust for pleasure and the deceptive prosperity of the régime? Then his mind moved on to another vision – his grandfather, born in 1780, one of the heroes of the Grande Armée, the victors of Austerlitz, Wagram and Friedland; his father, born in 1811, who had come down to bureaucracy, a humdrum salaried official, tax-collector at Le Chêne-Populeux, where he had burnt himself out; and finally himself, born in 1841, brought up to be a gentleman, a qualified lawyer and capable of the worst sillinesses and greatest enthusiasms, beaten at Sedan in a catastrophe that he knew must be immense and mark the end of a world. The degeneration of his race, which explained how France, victorious with the grandfathers, could be beaten in the time of their grandsons, weighed down on his heart like a hereditary disease getting steadily worse and leading to inevitable destruction when the appointed hour came. If it had been victory he would have felt so brave, so triumphant! In defeat he was as weak and nervous as a woman and giving in to one of those fits of despair in which the whole world collapsed. There was nothing left. France was dead. He began sobbing and cried, putting his hands together and going back to the faltering prayers of his childhood:","Below-stairs, at early daybreak, Maurice awoke upon his sofa. He was sore and stiff as if he had been racked; he did not stir, but lay looking listlessly at the windows, which gradually grew white under the light of a cloudy dawn. The hateful memories of the day before all came back to him with that distinctness that characterizes the impressions of our first waking, how they had fought, fled, surrendered. It all rose before his vision, down to the very least detail, and he brooded with horrible anguish on the defeat, whose reproachful echoes seemed to penetrate to the inmost fibers of his being, as if he felt that all the responsibility of it was his. And he went on to reason on the cause of the evil, analyzing himself, reverting to his old habit of bitter and unavailing self-reproach. He would have felt so brave, so glorious had victory remained with them! And now, in defeat, weak and nervous as a woman, he once again gave way to one of those overwhelming fits of despair in which the entire world, seemed to him to be foundering. Nothing was left them; the end of France was come. His frame was shaken by a storm of sobs, he wept hot tears, and joining his hands, the prayers of his childhood rose to his lips in stammering accents."
"– Paraît que nous sommes de l’arrière-garde, dit la voix blagueuse de Loubet.","“Seems we're in the rearguard,” said Loubet's joking voice.","‘We’re the rearguard, I suppose,’ said Loubet in his sarcastic voice.","“Guess we must be the rear-guard,” Loubet observed with good-natured raillery."
"Cependant, il sentit la cuisson du pansement à l’alcool. Et, comme on approchait le brancard pour le remporter, une terrible détonation ébranla la fabrique entière : c’était un obus qui venait d’éclater en arrière du hangar, dans la petite cour où se trouvait la pompe. Des vitres volèrent en éclats, tandis qu’une épaisse fumée envahissait l’ambulance. Dans la salle, une panique avait soulevé les blessés de leur couche de paille, et tous criaient d’épouvante, et tous voulaient fuir.","However, he felt the alcohol bandage cooking. And, as they approached the stretcher to take it away, a terrible explosion shook the whole factory: it was a shell which had just burst behind the shed, in the little yard where the pump was. Windows shattered as thick smoke filled the ambulance. In the room, a panic had lifted the wounded from their layer of straw, and all were screaming in terror, and all wanted to flee.","But then he felt the sting of the spirit dressing. And as the stretcher was being brought up to take him away a terrible explosion shook the whole factory. It was a shell that had exploded behind the shed, in the little yard where the pump was. Windows were shattered and a thick smoke came into the ambulance station. In the other hall the wounded had risen in panic from their straw beds and were all screaming with fear and trying to run away.","He was conscious of the pain, however, when the alcohol of the dressing touched the raw flesh. He flinched a little, complaining that they were burning him. And just as they were bringing up the stretcher preparatory to carrying him back into the other room the factory was shaken to its foundations by a most terrific explosion; a shell had burst directly in the rear of the shed, in the small courtyard where the pump was situated. The glass in the windows was shattered into fragments, and a dense cloud of smoke came pouring into the ambulance. The wounded men, stricken with panic terror, arose from their bed of straw; all were clamoring with affright; all wished to fly at once."
"Elle l’interrompit, en se récriant.","She interrupted him, crying out.","She protested, cutting him short.","She interrupted him, protesting:"

"Gaude, le clairon, qui attendait l’ordre de sonner au ralliement, adossé à la grille, venait de s’endormir, glissant d’une seule coulée, s’étalant sur le dos. Tous succombaient un à un, ronflaient à poings fermés. Et, seul, le sergent Sapin restait les yeux grands ouverts, avec son nez pincé dans sa petite figure pâle, comme s’il lisait son malheur à l’horizon de cette ville inconnue.","Gaude, the bugler, who was waiting for the order to sound for rallying, leaning against the railing, had just fallen asleep, slipping in a single motion, sprawling on his back. All succumbed one by one, snoring soundly. And, alone, Sergeant Sapin remained with his eyes wide open, his nose pinched in his little pale face, as if reading his misfortune on the horizon of this unknown city.","Gaude the bugler, leaning against the railings while waiting for the order to blow fall-in, had slipped straight down and gone to sleep flat on his back. One by one they all gave in to sleep and were snoring away dead to the world. Only Sergeant Sapin was still standing, with his eyes wide open and his nose screwed up in his little pale face as though he were reading his own doom on the horizon of this unknown town.","Gaude, the bugler, was leaning against the iron railing, waiting for the lieutenant's order to sound the assembly; sleep came to him so suddenly that he slid from his position and within a second was lying flat on his back, unconscious.

"Le vieux continuait de marcher, avec des coups d’œil sur Jean, en train d’engloutir d’énormes bouchées de pain ; et, sans se presser, comme après une longue réflexion :","The old man kept walking, glancing at Jean, swallowing huge mouthfuls of bread; and, without hurrying, as if after a long reflection:","The old man was still walking up and down, casting glances at Jean, who was putting away enormous hunks of bread; and then, without hurrying, as though after long reflection:","The old man was pacing up and down the room, casting an occasional glance at Jean, who was bolting huge mouthfuls of bread; after apparently giving the subject long consideration he deliberately answered:"

"Et, sans que Fouchard s’y opposât, il alla ouvrir la fenêtre. Toute la vallée noire se creusa, roulant sa mer de ténèbres. Pourtant, lorsque les yeux s’étaient habitués, on distinguait très nettement le pont, éclairé par les feux des deux berges. Des cuirassiers passaient toujours, dans leurs grands manteaux blancs, pareils à des cavaliers fantômes, dont les chevaux, fouettés d’un vent de terreur, marchaient sur l’eau. Et cela sans fin, interminable, toujours du même train de vision lente. Vers la droite, les coteaux nus, où dormait l’armée, restaient dans une immobilité, un silence de mort.","And, without Fouchard objecting, he went and opened the window. The whole black valley hollowed out, rolling its sea of darkness. However, when the eyes had become accustomed, one could very clearly distinguish the bridge, lit by the lights of the two banks. Cuirassiers were still passing, in their great white cloaks, like phantom horsemen, whose horses, whipped by a wind of terror, marched on the water. And that without end, interminable, always from the same train of slow vision. To the right, the bare hillsides, where the army slept, remained in an immobility, a deathly silence.","He went over and opened the window, and Fouchard did not object. The whole black valley was scooped out below like a rolling sea of shadows. Nevertheless, when your eyes became accustomed to it you could make out quite clearly the bridge lit by the fires on either bank. There were still cuirassiers crossing, looking in their big white cloaks like phantom riders whose horses, whipped on by a wind of terror, were walking on the water. And that went on and on endlessly, and always at the same speed like a slow-moving vision. To the right the bare hills, where the army was sleeping, were still wrapped in a death-like stillness and silence.","He stepped to the window and opened it, Fouchard making no objection. Beneath lay the valley, a great bowl filled to the brim with blackness; presently, however, when his eyes became more accustomed to the obscurity, he had no difficulty in distinguishing the bridge, illuminated by the fires on the two banks. The cuirassiers were passing still, like phantoms in their long white cloaks, while their steeds trod upon the bosom of the stream and a chill wind of terror breathed on them from behind; and so the spectral train moved on, apparently interminable, in an endless, slow-moving vision of unsubstantial forms. Toward the right, over the bare hills where the slumbering army lay, there brooded a stillness and repose like death."
"– Tenez ! on s’est battu là-bas aujourd’hui, on attend les nouvelles. Eh bien ! les nouvelles, je vais vous les donner, moi !… On a rossé les Prussiens, rossé à ne leur laisser ni ailes ni pattes, rossé à en balayer les miettes !","- Hold ! we fought there today, we are waiting for the news. Well ! the news, I'll give them to you, me!... The Prussians were thrashed, thrashed until they left neither wings nor legs, thrashed until they swept away the crumbs!","‘Look! There has been fighting over yonder today and we are expecting news. Well, I’ll tell you what the news is… They have whacked the Prussians, whacked them so as to leave them neither wings nor feet, so that we’ll have to sweep up the crumbs!’","He drew his tall form up higher still and raised his arm aloft, like the staff of a battle-flag. “Look you, there has been a fight to-day, down yonder, and we are waiting for the news. Well! I will tell you what the news is—I will tell you, I! We have flogged the Prussians, flogged them until they didn't know whether they were a-foot or a-horseback, flogged them to powder, so that they had to be swept up in small pieces!”"
"Dans l’épaisse nuit, Jean regardait. La route était bordée d’arbres, et il lui semblait bien qu’elle traversait de vastes prairies. Puis, des montées, des descentes se produisirent. On arrivait à un village, qui devait être Ballay, lorsque la lourde nuée dont le ciel était obscurci, creva en une pluie violente. Les hommes avaient déjà reçu tant d’eau, qu’ils ne se fâchaient même plus, enflant les épaules. Mais Ballay était dépassé ; et, à mesure qu’ils s’approchaient de Quatre-Champs, se levaient des rafales de vent furieux. Au delà, quand ils eurent monté sur le vaste plateau dont les terres nues vont jusqu’à Noirval, l’ouragan fit rage, ils furent battus par un effroyable déluge. Et ce fut au milieu de ces vastes terres, qu’un ordre de halte arrêta, un à un, tous les régiments. Le 7e corps entier, trente et quelques mille hommes, s’y trouva réuni, comme le jour naissait, un jour boueux dans un ruissellement d’eau grise. Que se passait-il ? pourquoi cette halte ? Une inquiétude courait déjà dans les rangs, certains prétendaient que les ordres de marche venaient d’être changés. On leur avait fait mettre l’arme au pied, avec défense de rompre les rangs et de s’asseoir. Par instants, le vent balayait le haut plateau avec une violence telle, qu’ils devaient se serrer les uns contre les autres, pour n’être pas emportés. La pluie les aveuglait, leur lardait la peau, une pluie glaciale qui coulait sous leurs vêtements. Et deux heures s’écoulèrent, une interminable attente, on ne savait pourquoi, au milieu de l’angoisse qui de nouveau serrait tous les cœurs.","In the thick night, Jean watched. The road was lined with trees, and it seemed to him that it crossed vast meadows. Then, ascents, descents occurred. They were arriving at a village, which must have been Ballay, when the heavy cloud with which the sky was obscured burst in a violent rain. The men had already received so much water, that they weren't even angry anymore, puffing up their shoulders. But Ballay was overwhelmed; and, as they approached Quatre-Champs, there arose furious gusts of wind. Beyond, when they had climbed onto the vast plateau whose bare land extends as far as Noirval, the hurricane raged, they were beaten by a terrible deluge. And it was in the midst of these vast lands that an order to halt, one by one, all the regiments. The entire 7th Corps, thirty-odd thousand men, was assembled there, as day was breaking, a muddy day in a trickle of gray water. What was happening ? why this stop? There was already concern in the ranks, some claimed that the marching orders had just been changed. They had been made to take up arms, with the prohibition of breaking ranks and sitting down. At times the wind swept across the high plateau with such violence that they had to squeeze together to avoid being swept away. The rain blinded them, larding their skin, an icy rain that ran under their clothes. And two hours went by, an interminable wait, no one knew why, in the midst of the anguish that once again gripped all hearts.","Jean peered into the thick darkness. The road was lined with trees and it looked to him as though it went across open meadows. Then there were some ups and downs. They were entering a village which must be Ballay when the heavy clouds which darkened the sky burst into a deluge of rain. The men had already had so much wet that they had even given up grousing about it and just hunched their shoulders. But after Ballay, as they were approaching Quatre-Champs, the wind began to blow in furious squalls. Beyond there, when they had climbed up on to the great plateau stretching with its bare fields all the way to Noirval, the hurricane raged and they were lashed by a frightful cloudburst. And there, in the middle of this endless plain, came an order to halt which stopped all the regiments one by one. The whole 7th corps, thirty-odd thousand men, was standing there in a mass when day dawned – a muddy day in streams of grey water. What was up now? Why this halt? Already the ranks were getting restive, and some were suggesting that the order to march had been reversed. They had been made to stand easy but forbidden to break ranks and sit down. Sometimes the gale swept over the high plain with such force that they had to move close to each other so as not to be blown along. The rain blinded them and stung their skin, a freezing rain which got under their clothes. Two hours went by, an interminable wait, nobody knew why, and once again anxiety gripped every heart.","Jean looked out into the thick blackness. The road was bordered with trees on either hand and, as far as he could see, appeared to lie between wide meadows. Presently the country became rougher; there was a succession of sharp rises and descents, and just as they were entering a village which he supposed to be Balay, two straggling rows of houses bordering the road, the dense cloud that had obscured the heavens burst in a deluge of rain. The men had received so many duckings within the past few days that they took this one without a murmur, bowing their heads and plodding patiently onward; but when they had left Balay behind them and were crossing a wide extent of level ground near Quatre-Champs a violent wind began to rise. Beyond Quatre-Champs, when they had fought their way upward to the wide plateau that extends in a dreary stretch of waste land as far as Noirval, the wind increased to a hurricane and the driving rain stung their faces. There it was that the order, proceeding from the head of the column and re-echoed down the line, brought the regiments one after another to a halt, and the entire 7th corps, thirty-odd thousand men, found itself once more reunited in the mud and rain of the gray dawn. What was the matter? Why were they halted there? An uneasy feeling was already beginning to pervade the ranks; it was asserted in some quarters that there had been a change of orders. The men had been brought to ordered arms and forbidden to leave the ranks or sit down. At times the wind swept over the elevated plateau with such violence that they had to press closely to one another to keep from being carried off their feet. The rain blinded them and trickled in ice-cold streams beneath their collars down their backs. And two hours passed, a period of waiting that seemed as if it would never end, for what purpose no one could say, in an agony of expectancy that chilled the hearts of all."

"En quelques minutes, Jean fut débarrassé de sa marchandise. On se pressait, on riait : en voilà donc un qui était raisonnable, qui ne volait pas le pauvre monde ! Attirés par le bon marché, des Prussiens s’approchèrent aussi, et il dut faire du commerce avec eux. Il avait manœuvré de façon à franchir l’enceinte gardée, il vendit ses deux derniers cigares à un gros sergent barbu, qui ne parlait pas un mot de français.","In a few minutes, Jean was rid of his goods. We hurried, we laughed: here was one who was reasonable, who didn't steal from the poor people! Attracted by the cheapness, Prussians also approached, and he had to trade with them. He had maneuvered in such a way as to cross the guarded enclosure, he sold his last two cigars to a fat bearded sergeant who did not speak a word of French.","In a few minutes Jean got rid of his wares. They hurried on, laughing: at any rate there was somebody who sold things cheap and didn’t swindle poor people! Interested by the cheapness, some Prussians came up as well, and he had to have dealings with them. He had manoeuvred so as to pass through the enemy lines, and sold his last two cigars to a big bearded sergeant who couldn’t speak a word of French.","It took Jean less than two minutes to dispose of his stock of merchandise. The men came crowding about him with chaff and laughter: a reasonable fellow, that; he didn't rob poor chaps of their money! The Prussians themselves were attracted by such unheard-of bargains, and he was compelled to trade with them. He had all the time been working his way toward the edge of the enceinte, and his last two cigars went to a big sergeant with an immense beard, who could not speak a word of French."
"Désespéré de le voir si pâle, le caporal lui demanda paternellement :","Desperate to see him so pale, the corporal asked him paternally:","Upset at seeing him looking so pale, Jean asked in a fatherly way:","Distressed to see him looking so pale, the corporal affectionately asked him:"

"– Bonsoir ! conclut Bouroche. Je vais tâcher de dormir deux heures, j’en ai grand besoin.","- Good evening ! concludes Bouroche. I'm going to try to sleep two hours, I really need it.","Good night,’ concluded Bouroche. ‘I’m going to try and get a couple of hours’ sleep.

"Pourquoi Weiss ne revenait-il pas ? Il avait si formellement promis de rentrer, à la première attaque ! Et l’inquiétude d’Henriette croissait, elle s’imaginait des obstacles, la route coupée, les obus rendant déjà la retraite trop dangereuse. Peut-être même était-il arrivé un malheur. Elle en écartait la pensée, trouvant dans l’espoir un ferme soutien d’action. Puis, elle forma un instant le projet d’aller là-bas, de partir à la rencontre de son mari. Des incertitudes la retinrent : peut-être se croiseraient-ils ; et que deviendrait-elle, si elle le manquait ? et quel serait son tourment, à lui, s’il rentrait sans la trouver ? Du reste, la témérité d’une visite à Bazeilles en ce moment lui apparaissait naturelle, sans héroïsme déplacé, rentrant dans son rôle de femme active, faisant en silence ce que nécessitait la bonne tenue de son ménage. Où son mari était, elle devait être, simplement.","Why didn't Weiss come back? He had so formally promised to return, at the first attack! And Henriette's anxiety grew, she imagined obstacles, the road cut off, the shells already making the retreat too dangerous. Perhaps some misfortune had even happened. She dismissed the thought of it, finding in hope firm support for action. Then, she formed for a moment the project of going there, of going to meet her husband. Uncertainties held her back: perhaps they would meet; and what would become of her if she missed him? and what would be his torment if he returned without finding her? Moreover, the temerity of a visit to Bazeilles at this moment seemed natural to her, without undue heroism, returning to her role as an active woman, doing in silence what the good behavior of her household required. Where her husband was, she simply had to be.","Why wasn’t Weiss back? He had so solemnly promised to come home at the first attack! Henriette’s anxiety steadily grew as in her imagination she saw obstacles, the road cut, shells already making retreat too perilous. Perhaps something dreadful had happened to him. She thrust the thought aside, finding in hope a strong incentive for action. She thought for a moment of setting off in that direction to meet her husband, but second thoughts held her back – they might cross, and then what would happen to her if she missed him? And what agonies he would go through if he came back and didn’t find her. But the courage needed for a visit to Bazeilles at that moment seemed perfectly natural to her and not a case of foolhardy heroism, just part of her function as an active wife quietly carrying out whatever the proper running of her home demanded. Where her husband was she would be, that was all.","Why did not Weiss return? He had pledged himself so faithfully not to outstay the first attack! And Henriette began to be seriously alarmed, depicting to herself the various obstacles that might have detained him: perhaps he had not been able to leave the village, perhaps the roads were blocked or rendered impassable by the projectiles. It might even be that something had happened him, but she put the thought aside and would not dwell on it, preferring to view things on their brighter side and finding in hope her safest mainstay and reliance. For an instant she harbored the design of starting out and trying to find her husband, but there were considerations that seemed to render that course inadvisable: supposing him to have started on his return, what would become of her should she miss him on the way? and what would be his anxiety should he come in and find her absent? Her guiding principle in all her thoughts and actions was her gentle, affectionate devotedness, and she saw nothing strange or out of the way in a visit to Bazeilles under such extraordinary circumstances, accustomed as she was, like an affectionate little woman, to perform her duty in silence and do the thing that she deemed best for their common interest. Where her husband was, there was her place; that was all there was about it."
"– Comment, c’est toi !… Ma sœur m’a écrit. Moi qui voulais, ce matin, aller te demander aux bureaux de la guerre !","– What, it’s you!… My sister wrote to me. I wanted to go and ask you at the war offices this morning!","‘What, it’s you, Jean?… My sister wrote to me. And to think that this morning I meant to go and inquire about you at the War Ministry!’","“What, is it you! My sister wrote me about you. And just think, no later than this very morning I was going to look you up at the war office!”"
"Aussi, lorsque Maurice leur proposa de remettre le drapeau à quelqu’un de sûr, qui le cacherait, le défendrait au besoin, jusqu’au jour où il le rendrait intact, tous acceptèrent.","Also, when Maurice offered to give the flag to someone safe, who would hide it, defend it if necessary, until the day he returned it intact, everyone accepted.","So when Maurice proposed giving the flag to somebody quite reliable who would hide it and if necessary defend it until the day it could be returned intact, they all agreed.","When Maurice, therefore, proposed to entrust the standard to a reliable person who would conceal it and, in case of necessity, defend it, until such day as he should restore it to them intact, they all gave their assent."
"Cette réflexion frappa beaucoup Henriette. En effet, Delaherche n’était pas un homme à s’exposer inutilement. Elle en fut toute rassurée, elle alla tirer les rideaux, rabattre les persiennes ; et la chambre s’éclaira de la grande lumière rousse du ciel, où le soleil commençait à percer et à dorer le brouillard. Une des fenêtres était restée entr’ouverte, on entendait maintenant le canon, dans cette grande pièce tiède, si close et si étouffée tout à l’heure.","This reflection struck Henriette very much. Indeed, Delaherche was not a man to expose himself unnecessarily. She was quite reassured, she went to draw the curtains, pull down the shutters; and the room was lighted up with the great red light of the sky, where the sun was beginning to pierce and gild the mist. One of the windows had remained half open; the cannon could now be heard in this large warm room, so closed and so muffled just now.","no need to worry.’ This thought made a strong impression on Henriette, for it was quite true that Delaherche was not the sort of man to take pointless risks. She was quite reassured, went over and pulled back the curtains and pushed open the shutters, and the room was lit up by the bright pinkish light from the sky in which the sun was beginning to pierce the fog with gold. One of the windows was half open and you could now hear the gunfire in this big warm room, so close and shut in until a moment ago.","Henriette was struck by the justness of the argument; Delaherche, it was true, was distinctly not a man to expose himself uselessly. She was reassured, and went and drew the curtains and threw back the blinds; the tawny light from without, where the sun was beginning to pierce the fog with his golden javelins, streamed in a bright flood into the apartment. One of the windows was part way open, and in the soft air of the spacious bedroom, but now so close and stuffy, the two women could hear the sound of the guns."
"– Bien le bonsoir, au plaisir !","– Good evening, have fun!","‘Good night, see you again soon!’","“Good-night, good-night! an plaisir!”"
"– À Bazeilles… Ah ! non, ça n’est pas mon affaire… Moi, je vas ailleurs. Bien le bonsoir !","– At Bazeilles… Ah! no, that's none of my business... I'm going somewhere else. Good evening!","‘Bazeilles… Oh no, I don’t want that, I’m off somewhere else. Ta-ta!’","“To Bazeilles—oh, no, I guess not; I don't think my business lies that way —I have another engagement. Bye-bye, ta-ta!”"
"– Ah ! ouiche ! répondit Chouteau, puisqu’on a de tout, on nous en donnera d’autre, à l’étape.","– Ah! yes! replied Chouteau, since we have everything, we will be given more at the stage.","‘Don’t you believe it,’ answered Chouteau. ‘As they’ve got everything, they’ll give us some more at the next stop.’",you ought not to do that. The comrades will be hungry by and by.” “Let be!” replied Chouteau. “There is plenty of rice; they will give us more at the end of the march.”
"– En voilà un qui est dans le vrai, murmura Chouteau.","“Here is one who is right,” murmured Chouteau.","‘There’s somebody with some sense,’ murmured Chouteau.","“There's a man who knows what he is about,” muttered Chouteau."
"Mais le capitaine n’avait pas la joie du réveil, qui suit les opérations heureuses. Il se redressa un peu, retomba, bégayant d’une voix molle :","But the captain had not the joy of revival which follows successful operations. He straightened up a little, fell back, stammering in a soft voice:","But the captain had nothing like that happy awakening that follows successful operations. He sat up a little and then fell back, gasping in a lifeless voice:","But the captain did not show the cheeriness that follows a successful operation. He opened his eyes and made an attempt to raise himself, then fell back on his pillow, murmuring wearily, in a faint voice:"
"– Mon capitaine, expliqua-t-il, c’est un camarade que ces brigands viennent de blesser, et que je conduis à l’ambulance.","“Captain,” he explained, “is a comrade whom these brigands have just wounded, and whom I am taking to the ambulance.","‘Sir,’ he explained to the captain, ‘this is a comrade of mine those buggers have wounded, and I’m taking him to an ambulance station.’","“Captain,” he explained, “this is a comrade of mine, who has just been wounded by those bandits. I am taking him to the hospital.”"
"– Sois tranquille, ajouta-t-il avec un sourire, je n’ai pas d’autre idée que de veiller sur nos quatre meubles. Et je te promets, si le village est attaqué, s’il y a un danger quelconque, de revenir tout de suite.","- Don't worry, he added with a smile, I have no other idea but to watch over our four pieces of furniture. And I promise you, if the village is attacked, if there is any danger, to come back immediately.","‘Don’t you worry,’ he went on with a smile, ‘all I want to do is to keep an eye on our few sticks of furniture. I promise you that if the village is attacked or there is the slightest danger I shall come back at once.’","“You need not be alarmed,” he added, with a smile; “I harbor no darker design than the protection of our property, and I pledge my word that if the village is attacked, or if there is any appearance of danger, I will come home at once.”"
"Des voix, autour de lui, disaient de même ; et c’était une sombre satisfaction, le besoin de s’évader de ce cauchemar, de les voir enfin, ces Prussiens, qu’on était venu chercher, et devant lesquels on fuyait depuis tant de mortelles heures ! On allait donc leur envoyer des coups de fusil, s’alléger de ces cartouches qu’on avait apportées de si loin, sans en brûler une seule ! Cette fois, tous le sentaient, c’était l’inévitable bataille.","Voices around him said the same; and it was a gloomy satisfaction, the need to escape from this nightmare, to see them at last, these Prussians, whom we had come to look for, and before whom we had been fleeing for so many mortal hours! So we were going to send them shots, lighten up the cartridges we had brought from so far away, without burning a single one! This time, everyone felt it, it was the inevitable battle.","Voices round him were saying the same thing, and there was a feeling of grim satisfaction, the need to get out of this nightmare at last by seeing those Prussians, whom they had come to find and from whom they had been running away for so many mortal hours. So they were going to give them a bit of rifle-fire and unload themselves of these cartridges they had carted so far without firing a single one! This time, they all felt, it was the inevitable battle.","There was a feeling of stern satisfaction that at last their long nightmare was to be dispelled, that at last they were to have a sight of those Prussians whom they had come out to look for, and before whom they had been retreating so many weary days; that they were to be given a chance to try a shot at them, and lighten the load of cartridges that had been tugging at their belts so long, with never an opportunity to burn a single one of them. Everyone felt that, this time, the battle would not, could not be avoided."
"Il serrait les poings, il fallut que Silvine, très pâle, le calmât du regard, à chaque factionnaire qu’ils rencontraient, le long de la route. Les Bavarois avaient en effet posé des sentinelles près des maisons qui brûlaient encore ; et ces hommes, le fusil chargé, la baïonnette au canon, semblaient garder les incendies, pour que la flamme achevât son œuvre. D’un geste menaçant, d’un cri guttural, quand on s’entêtait, ils en écartaient les simples curieux, les intéressés aussi qui rôdaient aux alentours. Des groupes d’habitants, à distance, restaient muets, avec des frémissements de rage contenus. Une femme, toute jeune, les cheveux épars, la robe souillée de boue, s’obstinait devant le tas fumant d’une petite maison, dont elle voulait fouiller les braises ardentes, malgré le factionnaire qui en défendait l’approche. On disait que cette femme avait eu son enfant brûlé dans cette maison. Et, tout d’un coup, comme le Bavarois l’écartait d’une main brutale, elle se retourna, elle lui vomit à la face son furieux désespoir, des injures de sang et de fange, des mots immondes qui la soulageaient un peu, enfin. Il devait ne pas comprendre, il la regardait, inquiet, reculant. Trois camarades accoururent, le délivrèrent de la femme, qu’ils emmenèrent, hurlante. Devant les décombres d’une autre maison, un homme et deux fillettes, tous les trois tombés sur le sol de fatigue et de misère, sanglotaient, ne sachant où aller, ayant vu là s’envoler en cendre tout ce qu’ils possédaient. Mais une patrouille passa, qui dissipa les curieux, et la route redevint déserte, avec les seules sentinelles, mornes et dures, veillant d’un œil oblique à faire respecter leur consigne scélérate.","He clenched his fists, Silvine, very pale, had to calm him down with her gaze at each sentry they met along the road. The Bavarians had in fact posted sentries near the houses which were still burning; and these men, with loaded guns and fixed bayonets, seemed to be watching the fires, so that the flame might finish its work. With a threatening gesture, a guttural cry, when we were stubborn, they pushed aside the simple curious, the interested ones also who prowled around. Groups of inhabitants, at a distance, remained silent, with tremors of suppressed rage. A very young woman, her hair disheveled, her dress soiled with mud, persisted in front of the smoking heap of a little house, the burning embers of which she wanted to search, in spite of the sentry who forbade approach. It was said that this woman had her child burned in this house. And all of a sudden, as the Bavarian pushed her away with a brutal hand, she turned round, she spewed her furious despair in his face, insults of blood and filth, filthy words which relieved her a little. , finally. He must not have understood, he looked at her, worried, recoiling. Three comrades ran up, freed him from the woman, whom they led away, screaming. In front of the rubble of another house, a man and two little girls, all three fallen to the ground from exhaustion and misery, were sobbing, not knowing where to go, having seen everything they owned go to ashes. But a patrol passed, which dissipated the curious, and the road became deserted again, with only the sentinels, gloomy and hard, watching with oblique eyes to enforce their villainous instructions.","He was clenching his fists, and Silvine, very scared, had to calm him down with a look every time they met a picket along the road. The Bavarians had posted sentries in front of houses still burning, and these men, with rifles loaded and fixed bayonets, seemed to be guarding the fires so as to let the flames finish their work. Sightseers or interested parties wandering round were headed off with a threatening gesture and a guttural oath if they persisted. Groups of inhabitants, keeping their distance, said nothing but were boiling with rage inside. One quite young woman, with unkempt hair and mud-stained dress, would not be moved from in front of the ruins of a little house, wanting to search among the red-hot cinders in spite of the sentry keeping people away. It was said that her child had been burnt to death in that house. Suddenly, as the Bavarian was savagely pushing her away, she spat her furious despair in his face, curses made up of blood and filth, obscene words in which she at last found some slight relief. He obviously did not understand, but looked at her nervously and moved back. Three of his companions ran up and freed him from the woman, whom they took away screaming. In front of the ruins of another house a man and two little girls had collapsed on the ground with fatigue and misery, and they were crying together, with nowhere to go, having seen everything they possessed disappear into ashes. A patrol came along and cleared off the sightseers, and the street was left empty with only the grim, hard sentries keeping a watch to make sure that their dastardly orders were respected.","He doubled his fists, and Silvine, who was white as a ghost, had to exert the influence of her glance to calm him every time they encountered a sentry on their way. The Bavarians had posted sentinels near all the houses that were still burning, and it seemed as if those men, with loaded muskets and fixed bayonets, were guarding the fires in order that the flames might finish their work. They drove away the mere sightseers who strolled about in the vicinity, and the persons who had an interest there as well, employing first a menacing gesture, and in case that was not sufficient, uttering a single brief, guttural word of command. A young woman, her hair streaming about her shoulders, her gown plastered with mud, persisted in hanging about the smoking ruins of a little house, of which she desired to search the hot ashes, notwithstanding the prohibition of the sentry. The report ran that the woman's little baby had been burned with the house. And all at once, as the Bavarian was roughly thrusting her aside with his heavy hand, she turned on him, vomiting in his face all her despair and rage, lashing him with taunts and insults that were redolent of the gutter, with obscene words which likely afforded her some consolation in her grief and distress. He could not have understood her, for he drew back a pace or two, eying her with apprehension. Three comrades came running up and relieved him of the fury, whom they led away screaming at the top of her voice. Before the ruins of another house a man and two little girls, all three so weary and miserable that they could not stand, lay on the bare ground, sobbing as if their hearts would break; they had seen their little all go up in smoke and flame, and had no place to go, no place to lay their head. But just then a patrol went by, dispersing the knots of idlers, and the street again assumed its deserted aspect, peopled only by the stern, sullen sentries, vigilant to see that their iniquitous instructions were enforced."
"Mais, derrière lui, un autre petit bruit mou l’étonna. Et, comme il se retournait, il vit un soldat, frappé en plein cœur, qui tombait sur le dos. Les jambes eurent une courte convulsion, la face resta jeune et tranquille, foudroyée. C’était le premier mort, et il fut surtout bouleversé par le fracas du chassepot, rebondissant sur le pavé de la cour.","But, behind him, another small soft noise startled him. And, as he turned around, he saw a soldier, struck in the heart, who fell on his back. The legs had a short convulsion, the face remained young and calm, thunderstruck. It was the first death, and he was especially upset by the crash of the Chassepot, bouncing on the pavement of the courtyard.","Then he was startled by another little thud behind him. He looked round and saw a soldier, who had been shot through the heart, falling on his back. The legs made a few convulsive movements, the face stayed young and calm, suddenly still. This was the first man killed, and Weiss was particularly upset by the crash of his rifle as it fell on the cobbles of the yard.","Then close behind him there was a little dull, strange sound that he had never heard before, and turning quickly he saw a soldier, shot through the heart, in the act of falling backward. There was a brief convulsive movement of the legs; the youthful, tranquil expression of the face remained, stamped there unalterably by the hand of death. It was the first casualty, and the accountant was startled by the crash of the musket falling and rebounding from the stone pavement of the courtyard."
"D’un air grave, Jean interrompit Henriette.","Seriously, Jean interrupted Henriette.",In a serious voice Jean broke in:,"Here Jean, a thoughtful expression on his face, interrupted Henriette."
"Enfin, après une heure encore d’attente, le 106e reçut l’ordre d’avancer. Seulement, le pont était toujours si encombré par la queue de la division, que le plus fâcheux désordre se produisit. Plusieurs régiments se mêlèrent, des compagnies filèrent quand même, emportées ; tandis que d’autres, rejetées au bord de la route, durent marquer le pas. Et, pour mettre le comble à la confusion, un escadron de cavalerie s’entêta à passer, refoulant dans les champs voisins les traînards que l’infanterie semait déjà. Au bout de la première heure de marche, toute une débandade traînait le pied, s’allongeait, attardée comme à plaisir.","Finally, after another hour of waiting, the 106th received the order to advance. Only, the bridge was always so encumbered by the tail of the division, that the most annoying disorder occurred. Several regiments mingled, companies slipped away all the same, carried away; while others, pushed to the side of the road, had to mark time. And, to add to the confusion, a squadron of cavalry stubbornly pushed through, driving back into the neighboring fields the stragglers whom the infantry had already scattered. At the end of the first hour of walking, a whole stampede was dragging its feet, stretching out, lingering as if at pleasure.","At last, after yet another hour’s wait, the 106th received the order to proceed. But the bridge was still so jammed with the tail end of the division that there was hell’s own muddle. Several regiments got mixed up, some companies got carried along willy-nilly, but others were pushed to the side of the road and had to mark time. And to complete the confusion, a squadron of cavalry insisted on riding through and pushed back into the fields some of the stragglers already dropping out of the infantry. After one hour of marching it was an out-and-out rabble, dragging its feet, stringing out in a line and dallying about as though nothing mattered.","At last, after another hour's waiting, the order was given for the 106th to advance, but the bridge was still so encumbered by the rear of the division that the greatest confusion prevailed. Several regiments became inextricably mingled, and whole companies were swept away and compelled to cross whether they would or no, while others, crowded off to the side of the road, had to stand there and mark time; and by way of putting the finishing touch to the muddle; a squadron of cavalry insisted on passing, pressing back into the adjoining fields the stragglers that the infantry had scattered along the roadside. At the end of an hour's march the column had entirely lost its formation and was dragging its slow length along, a mere disorderly rabble."
"– Sales bougres, je vas vous monter là-haut à coups de botte dans le derrière, moi ! Voulez-vous bien obéir, ou je casse la gueule au premier qui tourne les talons !","- Dirty buggers, I'm going to get you up there kicking in the behind, me! Will you obey, or I'll beat the crap out of whoever turns on my heels!","‘You bleeding lot of sods, I’ll get you up there with kicks up the arse! Will you do as you’re told, if not, the first man to turn on his heels – I’ll sock him one on the jaw!’","“You dirty loafers, I'll see whether you will go up there or not! I'll kick you up! About face! and I'll break the jaw of the first man that refuses to obey!”"
"Dès le lendemain matin, le 106e partit un des premiers, entassé dans des wagons à bestiaux. Le wagon où se trouvait l’escouade de Jean, fut particulièrement empli, à ce point que Loubet prétendait qu’il n’avait pas la place pour éternuer. Comme les distributions, une fois de plus, venaient d’avoir lieu dans le plus grand désordre, les soldats ayant reçu en eau-de-vie ce qu’ils auraient dû recevoir en vivres, presque tous étaient ivres, d’une ivresse violente et hurlante, qui se répandait en chansons obscènes. Le train roulait, on ne se voyait plus dans le wagon, que la fumée des pipes noyait d’un brouillard ; il y régnait une insupportable chaleur, la fermentation de ces corps empilés ; tandis que, de la voiture noire et fuyante, sortaient des vociférations, dominant le grondement des roues, allant s’éteindre au loin, dans les mornes campagnes. Et ce fut seulement à Langres que les troupes comprirent qu’on les ramenait vers Paris.","The next morning, the 106th left one of the first, crammed into cattle cars. The car where Jean's squad was was particularly full, so much so that Loubet claimed he had no room to sneeze. As the distributions, once again, had just taken place in the greatest disorder, the soldiers having received in brandy what they should have received in food, almost all were drunk, with a violent intoxication and screaming, which spilled out into obscene songs. The train was rolling, we could no longer see each other in the carriage, which the smoke from the pipes drowned in a mist; there reigned an unbearable heat, the fermentation of these piled up bodies; while, from the black and receding car, came vociferations, dominating the roar of the wheels, going to die off in the distance, in the gloomy countryside. And it was only in Langres that the troops understood that they were being brought back to Paris.","The next morning the 106th was among the first to leave, piled up in cattle trucks. It was particularly crowded in the truck where Jean’s unit was, so much so that Loubet made out he hadn’t room to sneeze. As once again the issue of rations had been a complete muddle, and the soldiers had received in spirits what they should have had in food, they were nearly all drunk with a violent and bawling drunkenness that worked itself off in obscene singing. The train went on and on and you couldn’t see the others in the truck, so thick was the haze of pipe smoke; the heat was unbearable, with the stink of all these bodies in a heap, and as the truck sped along there issued out of the blackness shoutings that drowned the noise of the wheels and died away across the dreary countryside. It was only at Langres that the troops realized they were being taken back to Paris.","Early the next morning the 106th was bundled into cattle-cars and started off among the first. The car that contained Jean's squad was particularly crowded, so much so that Loubet declared there was not even room in it to sneeze. It was a load of humanity, sent off to the war just as a load of sacks would have been dispatched to the mill, crowded in so as to get the greatest number into the smallest space, and as rations had been given out in the usual hurried, slovenly manner and the men had received in brandy what they should have received in food, the consequence was that they were all roaring drunk, with a drunkenness that vented itself in obscene songs, varied by shrieks and yells. The heavy train rolled slowly onward; pipes were alight and men could no longer see one another through the dense clouds of smoke; the heat and odor that emanated from that mass of perspiring human flesh were unendurable, while from the jolting, dingy van came volleys of shouts and laughter that drowned the monotonous rattle of the wheels and were lost amid the silence of the deserted fields. And it was not until they reached Langres that the troops learned that they were being carried back to Paris."
"– Partons, je vais vous conduire, déclara-t-il. J’ai appris tout à l’heure où campait le 106e.","“Let's go, I'll drive you,” he said. I learned just now where the 106th was camped.","‘Let’s be off, I’ll show you the way,’ he said. ‘I found out just now where the 106th is camping.’",“Come along; I will go with you. I learned this afternoon where the 106th's camp is situated.”
"Le projet d’Henriette fut alors d’atteindre Bazeilles par ces vastes prés bordant la Meuse. Cela, d’ailleurs, n’était pas très net en elle. Soudain, elle resta plantée, au bord d’une petite mer immobile, qui, de ce côté-ci, lui barrait le chemin. C’était l’inondation, les terres basses changées en un lac de défense, auxquelles elle n’avait point songé. Un instant, elle voulut retourner en arrière ; puis, au risque d’y laisser ses chaussures, elle continua, suivit le bord, dans l’herbe trempée, où elle enfonçait jusqu’à la cheville. Pendant une centaine de mètres, ce fut praticable. Ensuite, elle buta contre le mur d’un jardin : le terrain dévalait, l’eau battait le mur, profonde de deux mètres. Impossible de passer. Ses petits poings se serrèrent, elle dut se raidir de toute sa force, pour ne pas fondre en larmes. Après le premier saisissement, elle longea la clôture, trouva une ruelle qui filait entre les maisons éparses. Cette fois, elle se crut sauvée, car elle connaissait ce dédale, ces bouts de sentiers enchevêtrés, dont l’écheveau aboutissait tout de même au village.","Henriette's plan was then to reach Bazeilles by these vast meadows bordering the Meuse. This, moreover, was not very clear in her. Suddenly, she remained planted, at the edge of a small motionless sea, which, on this side, barred her way. It was the inundation, the lowlands changed into a defensive lake, of which she had not thought. For a moment she wanted to go back; then, at the risk of leaving her shoes there, she continued, followed the edge, in the wet grass, where she sank to the ankle. For a hundred yards it was passable. Then she stumbled against the wall of a garden: the ground was falling, the water beating the wall, two meters deep. Unable to pass. Her little fists clenched, she had to stiffen with all her strength, not to burst into tears. After the first shock, she walked along the fence, found an alley that ran between the scattered houses. This time, she thought she was saved, because she knew this maze, these tangled ends of paths, the skein of which ended all the same in the village.","Henriette’s plan was to reach Bazeilles through these stretches of meadow that bordered the Meuse. Not that she was very clear about it herself. Suddenly she stopped, stuck on the edge of a little pool that prevented her from going on in that direction. It was the flooding, this low-lying ground turned into a defensive lake, and she had not thought of that. For a moment she thought of going back, but then, at the risk of leaving her shoes in it, she went on, working along the edge, sinking ankle-deep in the muddy grass. For a hundred metres it was possible, but then she ran up against a garden wall and the land sloped downwards, so that the waters lapped the wall and were two metres deep. Impossible to get through. She clenched her small fists and had to take the firmest grip on herself so as not to burst into tears. When the first shock was over she skirted the wall the other way and found a narrow lane between a few houses. This time she thought she was saved, for she knew this maze of odd, twisting alleys, a tangle that did in the end lead to the village.","Henriette's plan now was to reach Bazeilles by those broad levels that border the Meuse. She was not very clear about it in her mind, however, and continued to hasten onward in obedience to that blind instinct which had originally imparted to her its impulse. She had not gone far before she found herself standing and gazing in dismay at a miniature ocean which barred her further progress in that direction. It was the inundated fields, the low-lying lands that a measure of defense had converted into a lake, which had escaped her memory. For a single moment she thought of turning back; then, at the risk of leaving her shoes behind, she pushed on, hugging the bank, through the water that covered the grass and rose above her ankles. For a hundred yards her way, though difficult, was not impracticable; then she encountered a garden-wall directly in her front; the ground fell off sharply, and where the wall terminated the water was six feet deep. Her path was closed effectually; she clenched her little fists and had to summon up all her resolution to keep from bursting into tears. When the first shock of disappointment had passed over she made her way along the enclosure and found a narrow lane that pursued a tortuous course among the scattered houses. She believed that now her troubles were at an end, for she was acquainted with that labyrinth, that tangled maze of passages, which, to one who had the key to them, ended at the village."
"Aussi Delaherche finit-il par se départir de son attitude froide. Les familles bourgeoises s’étaient enfermées au fond de leurs appartements, évitant tout rapport avec les officiers qu’elles logeaient. Mais lui, agité de son continuel besoin de parler, de plaire, de jouir de la vie, souffrait beaucoup de ce rôle de vaincu boudeur. Sa grande maison silencieuse et glacée, où chacun vivait à part, dans une raideur de rancune, lui pesait terriblement aux épaules. Aussi commença-t-il, un jour, par arrêter M. de Gartlauben dans l’escalier, pour le remercier de ses services. Et, peu à peu, l’habitude fut prise, les deux hommes échangèrent quelques paroles, quand ils se rencontrèrent ; de sorte qu’un soir le capitaine prussien se trouva assis, dans le cabinet du fabricant, au coin de la cheminée où brûlaient d’énormes bûches de chêne, fumant un cigare, causant en ami des nouvelles récentes. Pendant les premiers quinze jours, Gilberte ne parut pas, il affecta d’ignorer son existence, bien qu’au moindre bruit il tournât vivement les yeux vers la porte de la chambre voisine. Il semblait vouloir faire oublier sa situation de vainqueur, se montrait d’esprit dégagé et large, plaisantait volontiers certaines réquisitions qui prêtaient à rire. Ainsi, un jour qu’on avait réquisitionné un cercueil et un bandage, ce bandage et ce cercueil l’amusèrent beaucoup. Pour le reste, le charbon de terre, l’huile, le lait, le sucre, le beurre, le pain, la viande, sans compter des vêtements, des poêles, des lampes, enfin tout ce qui se mange et tout ce qui sert à la vie quotidienne, il avait un haussement d’épaules : mon Dieu ! que voulez-vous ? c’était vexatoire sans doute, il convenait même qu’on demandait trop ; seulement, c’était la guerre, il fallait bien vivre en pays ennemi. Delaherche, qu’irritaient ces réquisitions incessantes, gardait son franc-parler, les épluchait chaque soir, comme s’il eût examiné le livre de sa cuisine. Pourtant, ils n’eurent qu’une discussion vive, au sujet de la contribution d’un million, dont le préfet prussien de Rethel venait de frapper le département des Ardennes, sous le prétexte de compenser les pertes causées à l’Allemagne par les vaisseaux de guerre français et par l’expulsion des Allemands domiciliés en France. Dans la répartition, Sedan devait payer quarante-deux mille francs. Et il s’épuisa à faire comprendre à son hôte que cela était inique, que la situation de la ville se trouvait exceptionnelle, qu’elle avait déjà trop souffert pour être ainsi frappée. D’ailleurs, tous deux sortaient plus intimes de ces explications, lui enchanté de s’être étourdi du flot de sa parole, le Prussien content d’avoir fait preuve d’une urbanité toute parisienne.","So Delaherche ended up abandoning his cold attitude. The bourgeois families had locked themselves in the back of their apartments, avoiding any contact with the officers they lodged. But he, agitated by his continual need to talk, to please, to enjoy life, suffered greatly from this role of sulky vanquished. His big, silent, frozen house, where everyone lived apart, in a stiffness of resentment, weighed terribly on his shoulders. So he began one day by stopping M. de Gartlauben on the stairs to thank him for his services. And, little by little, the habit was taken, the two men exchanged a few words, when they met; so that one evening the Prussian captain found himself seated, in the cabinet of the manufacturer, at the corner of the chimney where enormous logs of oak were burning, smoking a cigar, talking as a friend of recent news. During the first fortnight Gilberte did not appear, he affected to be unaware of her existence, although at the slightest noise he quickly turned his eyes towards the door of the adjoining room. He seemed to want to make people forget his position as the winner, showed himself to be open-minded and broad, willingly joked about certain requisitions that made people laugh. Thus, one day when a coffin and a bandage had been requisitioned, this bandage and this coffin amused him greatly. For the rest, charcoal, oil, milk, sugar, butter, bread, meat, not to mention clothes, stoves, lamps, in short everything that is eaten and everything that is useful to everyday life, he had a shrug of the shoulders: my God! what do you want ? it was no doubt vexatious, it was even true that too much was being asked; only, it was war, you had to live in an enemy country. Delaherche, irritated by these incessant requisitions, kept his outspokenness, going through them every evening, as if he had been examining his cookbook. However, they had only a lively discussion, on the subject of the contribution of a million, which the Prussian prefect of Rethel had just imposed on the department of the Ardennes, under the pretext of compensating for the losses caused to Germany by the French warships and by the expulsion of Germans domiciled in France. In the apportionment, Sedan was to pay forty-two thousand francs. And he exhausted himself trying to make his host understand that this was iniquitous, that the situation of the town was exceptional, that it had already suffered too much to be so struck. Moreover, both came out of these explanations more intimate, he delighted to have been dazed by the flow of his words, the Prussian happy to have shown proof of a very Parisian urbanity.","So it came about that Delaherche eventually gave up his unfriendly attitude. The better class families had shut themselves up in their apartments and avoided any contact with the officers they had billeted on them. But he, with his continual urge to talk, please people and enjoy life, found this role of sulking victim very irksome. His big, cold, silent house in which each one kept to himself in the stiffness of resentment, got terribly on his nerves. So one day he began by stopping von Gartlauben on the staircase and thanking him for his kind services. Gradually the habit grew and the two men exchanged a few words when they met, and thus one evening the Prussian captain found himself sitting in the manufacturer’s study, by the fire on which enormous oak logs were blazing, smoking a cigar and discussing recent events in a friendly way. For the first two weeks Gilberte did not appear and he pretended to be unaware of her existence, although at the slightest sound he glanced quickly at the door of the next room. He seemed to want everybody to forget his position as one of the conquerors, displayed a fair and broad-minded attitude, and often joked about some of the more laughable requisitions. For instance one day a coffin and a bandage had been requisitioned and that bandage and coffin struck him as very funny. For the rest, coal, oil, milk, sugar, butter, bread, meat, to say nothing of clothes, stoves, lamps, in fact anything that can be eaten or used in daily life, he just shrugged his shoulders about it. After all, what can you expect? It was annoying, no doubt, and he even admitted that they were asking for too much, but it was war, and you had to live in an enemy country. Delaherche, who was irritated by these incessant requisitionings, spoke out plainly and went over them in detail every evening as though he were going through his kitchen accounts. There was, however, just one fierce argument between them about the levy of a million francs which the Prussian prefect in Rethel had imposed upon the department of the Ardennes on the pretext that Germany needed compensation for losses caused by French warships and through the expulsion of Germans resident in France. The share to be paid by Sedan was forty-two thousand. Delaherche wore himself out trying to make his guest understand that that was iniquitous, that the situation of the town was exceptional because it had already suffered too much to be struck again in this way. As a matter of fact they both emerged from these explanations on more intimate terms, for he was delighted at having made himself drunk with his own verbosity, and the Prussian was pleased with himself for having displayed a quite Parisian urbanity.","Owing to these circumstances, Delaherche at last began to lay aside his frostiness of manner. As a general thing the bourgeois families shut themselves in their apartments and avoided all communication with the officers who were billeted on them; but to him, who was of a sociable nature and liked to extract from life what enjoyment it had to offer, this enforced sulkiness in the end became unbearable. His great, silent house, where the inmates lived apart from one another in a chill atmosphere of distrust and mutual dislike, damped his spirits terribly. He began by stopping M. de Gartlauben on the stairs one day to thank him for his favors, and thus by degrees it became a regular habit with the two men to exchange a few words when they met. The result was that one evening the Prussian captain found himself seated in his host's study before the fireplace where some great oak logs were blazing, smoking a cigar and amicably discussing the news of the day. For the first two weeks of their new intimacy Gilberte did not make her appearance in the room; he affected to ignore her existence, although, at every faintest sound, his glance would be directed expectantly upon the door of the connecting apartment. It seemed to be his object to keep his position as an enemy as much as possible in the background, trying to show he was not narrow-minded or a bigoted patriot, laughing and joking pleasantly over certain rather ridiculous requisitions. For example, a demand was made one day for a coffin and a shroud; that shroud and coffin afforded him no end of amusement. As regarded other things, such as coal, oil, milk, sugar, butter, bread, meat, to say nothing of clothing, stoves and lamps—all the necessaries of daily life, in a word—he shrugged his shoulders: mon Dieu! what would you have? No doubt it was vexatious; he was even willing to admit that their demands were excessive, but that was how it was in war times; they had to keep themselves alive in the enemy's country. Delaherche, who was very sore over these incessant requisitions, expressed his opinion of them with frankness, pulling them to pieces mercilessly at their nightly confabs, in much the same way as he might have criticised the cook's kitchen accounts. On only one occasion did their discussion become at all acrimonious, and that was in relation to the impost of a million francs that the Prussian prefet at Rethel had levied on the department of the Ardennes, the alleged pretense of which was to indemnify Germany for damages caused by French ships of war and by the expulsion of Germans domiciled in French territory. Sedan's proportionate share of the assessment was forty-two thousand francs. And he labored strenuously with his visitor to convince him of the iniquity of the imposition; the city was differently circumstanced from the other towns, it had had more than its share of affliction, and should not be burdened with that new exaction. The pair always came out of their discussions better friends than when they went in; one delighted to have had an opportunity of hearing himself talk, the other pleased with himself for having displayed a truly Parisian urbanity."
"Mais, à ce moment, Maurice s’aperçut avec joie que Jean rouvrait les yeux ; et, comme il courait à un ruisseau voisin, voulant lui laver la figure, il fut très surpris de revoir, à sa droite, au fond du vallon écarté, protégé par des pentes rudes, le paysan qu’il avait vu le matin et qui continuait à labourer sans hâte, poussant sa charrue attelée d’un grand cheval blanc. Pourquoi perdre un jour ? Ce n’était pas parce qu’on se battait, que le blé cesserait de croître et le monde de vivre.","But, at this moment, Maurice noticed with joy that Jean opened his eyes; and, as he was running to a nearby stream, wanting to wash his face, he was very surprised to see again, on his right, at the bottom of the remote valley, protected by steep slopes, the peasant whom he had seen in the morning and who continued to plough without haste, pushing his plow harnessed to a large white horse. Why waste a day? It wasn't because we fought that the wheat would stop growing and the world stop living.","And then Maurice saw with joy that Jean’s eyes were opening, and as he ran over to a little stream for water to wash his face, he was very surprised to see once again on his right, down in a quiet valley, sheltered by the steep hills, the same peasant he had seen in the morning, who was still slowly ploughing, guiding his plough behind a big white horse. Why lose a day? They might be fighting, but that was no reason why the corn should stop growing and the world stop living.","But to Maurice, at that moment, was granted the satisfaction of seeing Jean unclose his eyes, and as he was running to a stream that flowed near by, for water with which to bathe his friend's face, he was surprised, looking down on his right into a sheltered valley that lay between rugged slopes, to behold the same peasant whom he had seen that morning, still leisurely driving the plow through the furrow with the assistance of his big white horse. Why should he lose a day? Men might fight, but none the less the corn would keep on growing; and folks must live."
"Tout d’un coup, dans un petit vallon, l’horreur cessa. Sans doute, la bataille avait passé ailleurs, sans toucher à ce coin de nature délicieux. Pas un arbre n’était effleuré, pas une blessure n’avait saigné sur la mousse. Un ruisseau coulait parmi des lentilles d’eau, le sentier qui le suivait était ombragé de grands hêtres. C’était d’un charme pénétrant, d’une paix adorable, cette fraîcheur des eaux vives, ce silence frissonnant des verdures.","Suddenly, in a small valley, the horror ceased. Doubtless the battle had passed elsewhere, without touching this delightful corner of nature. Not a tree was touched, not a wound had bled on the moss. A stream flowed among duckweed, the path that followed it was shaded by tall beeches. It was of a penetrating charm, of an adorable peace, this freshness of running waters, this quivering silence of greenery.","When they reached a little coomb the horror suddenly came to an end. The battle must have passed over without touching this lovely corner of nature. Not a single tree had been touched, no wound had bled on the mossy bank. A brook swirled its little eddies along and the path that followed it was shaded by lofty beech trees. The cool running water and soft rustle of greenery had a pervasive charm and was delightfully peaceful.","Presently they came to a little valley, where the sights of horror abruptly ended. The battle had evidently turned at this point and expended its force in another direction, leaving this peaceful nook of nature untouched. The trees were all uninjured; the carpet of velvety moss was undefiled by blood. A little brook coursed merrily among the duckweed, the path that ran along its bank was shaded by tall beeches. A penetrating charm, a tender peacefulness pervaded the solitude of the lovely spot, where the living waters gave up their coolness to the air and the leaves whispered softly in the silence."
"Mais, après Saint-Étienne, le chemin devint abominable, un chemin qui montait par ondulations lentes, au milieu de vastes champs stériles, dans lesquels ne poussaient que les éternels bois de pins, à la verdure noire, si triste au milieu des terres blanches. On n’avait pas encore traversé une pareille désolation. Mal empierré, détrempé par les dernières pluies, le chemin était un véritable lit de boue, de l’argile grise délayée, où les pieds se collaient comme dans de la poix. La fatigue fut extrême, les hommes n’avançaient plus, épuisés. Et, pour comble d’ennui, des averses brusques se mirent à tomber, d’une violence terrible. L’artillerie, embourbée, faillit rester en route.","But, after Saint-Étienne, the path became abominable, a path that rose in slow undulations, in the middle of vast sterile fields, in which only the eternal pine woods grew, with their black greenery, so sad in the middle of the white lands. . We had never been through such desolation before. Badly paved, soaked by the recent rains, the path was a veritable bed of mud, thin gray clay, where the feet stuck together as if in pitch. The fatigue was extreme, the men were no longer advancing, exhausted. And, to make matters worse, sudden showers began to fall, with terrible violence. The artillery, bogged down, almost stayed on the road.","Past Saint-Etienne the road became atrocious, climbing by gentle humps amid the vast barren fields in which the only growth was the eternal pinewoods with their black foliage, so depressing against the chalky earth. They hadn’t crossed such a desolate area before. Badly surfaced, soaked by the recent rains, the road was a real sea of mud, diluted grey clay in which your feet stuck as if it were pitch. Everybody was extremely tired, and the exhausted men seemed to make no headway. And then to cap it all, it suddenly began to pour with terrible violence. The artillery almost stuck there in the quagmire.","After leaving Saint-Etienne, however, there was a change for the worse, and the road from bad became abominable, rising by an easy ascent between great sterile fields in which the only signs of vegetation were the everlasting pine woods with their dark verdure, forming a dismal contrast with the gray-white soil. It was the most forlorn spot they had seen yet. The ill-paved road, washed by the recent rains, was a lake of mud, of tenacious, slippery gray clay, which held the men's feet like so much pitch. It was wearisome work; the troops were exhausted and could not get forward, and as if things were not bad enough already, the rain suddenly began to come down most violently. The guns were mired and had to be left in the road."
"Avec son étourderie habituelle, elle l’introduisit, sans remarquer que les gants d’ordonnance étaient là encore, sur le guéridon. Vainement, Henriette se précipita pour les saisir et les jeter derrière un fauteuil. Madame Delaherche avait dû les voir, car elle demeura quelques secondes suffoquée, comme si elle ne pouvait reprendre haleine. Elle eut un involontaire regard autour de la chambre, s’arrêta au lit drapé de rouge, resté grand ouvert, dans son désordre.","With her usual thoughtlessness, she ushered him in, not noticing that the prescription gloves were still there, on the side table. In vain, Henriette rushed to seize them and throw them behind an armchair. Madame Delaherche must have seen them, for she remained choked for a few seconds, as if she could not catch her breath. She took an involuntary look around the room, stopped at the bed draped in red, which had remained wide open, in its disorder.","With her usual thoughtlessness she let her in without noticing that the army gloves were still there on the table. Henriette rushed to seize them and throw them behind an armchair, but in vain. Madame Delaherche must have noticed them, for she remained speechless for several seconds, as though she could not get her breath. She instinctively ran her eyes round the room, let them pause on the red curtained bed, still all unmade and in disorder.","With the thoughtlessness that was part of her nature, she allowed the old lady to enter without having first removed the gauntlets from the table. It was in vain that Henriette darted forward to seize them and throw them behind a chair. Madame Delaherche stood glaring for some seconds at the spot where they had been with an expression on her face as if she were slowly suffocating. Then her glance wandered involuntarily from object to object in the room, stopping finally at the great red-curtained bed, the coverings thrown back in disorder."
"Déjà, Otto levait le bras, dans un geste d’apostrophe. Il allait parler, avec la véhémence de ce froid et dur protestantisme militaire qui citait des versets de la Bible. Mais un regard sur la jeune femme, dont il venait de rencontrer les beaux yeux de clarté et de raison, l’arrêta. Et, d’ailleurs, son geste avait suffi, il avait dit sa haine de race, sa conviction d’être en France le justicier, envoyé par le Dieu des armées pour châtier un peuple pervers. Paris brûlait en punition de ses siècles de vie mauvaise, du long amas de ses crimes et de ses débauches. De nouveau, les Germains sauveraient le monde, balayeraient les dernières poussières de la corruption latine.","Already, Otto was raising his arm, in a gesture of apostrophe. He was about to speak, with the vehemence of that cold, hard military Protestantism which quoted verses from the Bible. But a look at the young woman, whose beautiful eyes of clarity and reason he had just met, stopped him. And, moreover, his gesture had been enough, he had expressed his hatred of race, his conviction of being in France the vigilante, sent by the God of armies to chastise a perverse people. Paris was burning in punishment for its centuries of bad life, for the long heap of its crimes and its debaucheries. Again, the Germans would save the world, sweep away the last dust of Latin corruption.","But Otto at once raised his arm as though delivering a reproof. He was about to speak with the vehemence of that cold, hard, militaristic Protestantism that can always quote verses of the Bible. But he caught the young woman’s beautiful, clear and reasonable eyes, and one glance stopped him. In any case his gesture had been enough, it had expressed his racial hatred and his conviction that he was in France as a judge sent by the Lord of Hosts to chastise a perverse people. Paris was burning as a punishment for centuries of wickedness, for the long tale of its crimes and debauches. Once again the Germanic tribes would save the world and sweep away the last remains of Latin corruption.","Otto raised his arm in an oratorical attitude. He was on the point of speaking, with the stern, cold-blooded vehemence of the military bigot who has ever a quotation from Holy Writ at his tongue's end, but glancing at the young woman, the look he encountered from her candid, gentle eyes checked him. Besides, his gesture had spoken for him; it told his hatred for the nation, his conviction that he was in France to mete out justice, delegated by the God of Armies, to chastise a perverse and stiff-necked generation. Paris was burning off there on the horizon in expiation of its centuries of dissolute life, of its heaped-up measure of crime and lust. Once again the German race were to be the saviors of the world, were to purge Europe of the remnant of Latin corruption."
"De toutes parts, d’ailleurs, du Nord comme du Centre, les nouvelles s’aggravaient. Dans le Nord, le 22e corps d’armée, formé de gardes mobiles, de compagnies de dépôt, de soldats et d’officiers échappés aux désastres de Sedan et de Metz, avait dû abandonner Amiens, pour se retirer du côté d’Arras ; et, à son tour, Rouen venait de tomber entre les mains de l’ennemi, sans que cette poignée d’hommes, débandés, démoralisés, l’eussent défendu sérieusement. Dans le Centre, la victoire de Coulmiers, remportée le 9 novembre par l’armée de la Loire, avait fait naître d’ardentes espérances : Orléans réoccupé, les Bavarois en fuite, la marche par Étampes, la délivrance prochaine de Paris. Mais, le 5 décembre, le prince Frédéric-Charles reprenait Orléans, coupait en deux l’armée de la Loire, dont trois corps se repliaient sur Vierzon et Bourges, tandis que deux autres, sous les ordres du général Chanzy, reculaient jusqu’au Mans, dans une retraite héroïque, toute une semaine de marches et de combats. Les Prussiens étaient partout, à Dijon comme à Dieppe, au Mans comme à Vierzon. Puis c’était, presque chaque matin, le lointain fracas de quelque place forte qui capitulait sous les obus. Dès le 28 septembre, Strasbourg avait succombé, après quarante-six jours de siège et trente-sept de bombardement, les murs hachés, les monuments criblés par près de deux cent mille projectiles. Déjà, la citadelle de Laon avait sauté, Toul s’était rendu ; et venait ensuite le défilé sombre : Soissons avec ses cent vingt-huit canons, Verdun qui en comptait cent trente-six, Neufbrisach cent, La Fère soixante-dix, Montmédy soixante-cinq. Thionville était en flammes, Phalsbourg n’ouvrait ses portes que dans sa douzième semaine de furieuse résistance. Il semblait que la France entière brûlât, s’effondrât, au milieu de l’enragée canonnade.","From all sides, moreover, from the North as well as from the Center, the news was getting worse. In the North, the 22nd Army Corps, made up of mobile guards, depot companies, soldiers and officers who had escaped the disasters of Sedan and Metz, had had to abandon Amiens to withdraw towards Arras; and, in its turn, Rouen had just fallen into the hands of the enemy, without this handful of men, disbanded, demoralized, having seriously defended it. In the Center, the victory of Coulmiers, won on November 9 by the Army of the Loire, had given rise to ardent hopes: Orléans reoccupied, the Bavarians in flight, the march through Étampes, the imminent deliverance of Paris. But on December 5, Prince Frederic-Charles retook Orléans, cut the Army of the Loire in two, three corps of which fell back on Vierzon and Bourges, while two others, under the orders of General Chanzy, fell back as far as the Mans, in a heroic retreat, a whole week of marches and battles. The Prussians were everywhere, in Dijon as in Dieppe, in Le Mans as in Vierzon. Then, almost every morning, there was the distant crash of some stronghold which capitulated under the shells. From September 28, Strasbourg had succumbed, after forty-six days of siege and thirty-seven of bombardment, the walls chopped down, the monuments riddled with nearly two hundred thousand projectiles. Already the citadel of Laon had been blown up, Toul had surrendered; and then came the dark defile: Soissons with its one hundred and twenty-eight guns, Verdun which had one hundred and thirty-six, Neufbrisach one hundred, La Fère seventy, Montmedy sixty-five. Thionville was in flames, Phalsbourg only opened its doors in its twelfth week of furious resistance. It seemed that the whole of France was burning, collapsing, in the midst of the furious cannonade.","Moreover the news from all directions, north as well as centre, was getting worse. In the north the 22nd army corps, made up of militia, men from supply depots and soldiers and officers who had escaped from the disasters of Sedan and Metz, had had to abandon Amiens and fall back towards Arras, while Rouen had fallen into enemy hands, for a handful of unattached, demoralized men had not seriously defended it. In the centre the victory at Coulmiers won on the 9 November by the army of the Loire had given rise to wild hopes: Orleans reoccupied, the Bavarians in flight, a march on Etampes and the early relief of Paris. But on 5 December Prince Friedrich Karl recaptured Orleans and cut in two the army of the Loire, three corps of which fell back to Vierzon and Bourges while two others under the command of General Chanzy withdrew to Le Mans in a heroic retreat during a whole week of marching and fighting. The Prussians were everywhere, Dijon and Dieppe, Le Mans and Vierzon. And every morning there was the distant crash of some fortress capitulating to shell fire. Strasbourg had fallen as early as 28 September, after forty-six days of siege and thirty-seven of bombardment, with its walls gashed and monuments riddled by nearly two hundred thousand projectiles. The citadel of Laon was already blown up, Toul had surrendered, and then came the dismal procession, Soissons with its hundred and twenty-eight guns, Verdun with its hundred and thirty-six, Neuf-Brisach a hundred, La Fère seventy, Montmédy sixty-five. Thionville was in flames. Phalsbourg only opened its gates in the twelfth week of its desperate resistance. The whole of France seemed to be ablaze and collapsing in this furious bombardment.","From every quarter, moreover, from the northern as well as from the central districts, most discouraging advices continued to arrive. In the north the 22d army corps, composed of gardes mobiles, depot companies from various regiments and such officers and men as had not been involved in the disasters of Sedan and Metz, had been forced to abandon Amiens and retreat on Arras, and on the 5th of December Rouen had also fallen into the hands of the enemy, after a mere pretense of resistance on the part of its demoralized, scanty garrison. In the center the victory of Coulmiers, achieved on the 3d of November by the army of the Loire, had resuscitated for a moment the hopes of the country: Orleans was to be reoccupied, the Bavarians were to be put to flight, the movement by way of Etampes was to culminate in the relief of Paris; but on December 5 Prince Frederick Charles had retaken Orleans and cut in two the army of the Loire, of which three corps fell back on Bourges and Vierzon, while the remaining two, commanded by General Chanzy, retired to Mans, fighting and falling back alternately for a whole week, most gallantly. The Prussians were everywhere, at Dijon and at Dieppe, at Vierzon as well as at Mans. And almost every morning came the intelligence of some fortified place that had capitulated, unable longer to hold out under the bombardment. Strasbourg had succumbed as early as the 28th of September, after standing forty-six days of siege and thirty-seven of shelling, her walls razed and her buildings riddled by more than two hundred thousand projectiles. The citadel of Laon had been blown into the air; Toul had surrendered; and following them, a melancholy catalogue, came Soissons with its hundred and twenty-eight pieces of artillery, Verdun, which numbered a hundred and thirty-six, Neufbrisach with a hundred, La Fere with seventy, Montmedy, sixty-five. Thionville was in flames, Phalsbourg had only opened her gates after a desperate resistance that lasted eighty days. It seemed as if all France were doomed to burn and be reduced to ruins by the never-ceasing cannonade."
"Mais Jean s’était approché du corps de Maurice. Il le regarda, avec son grand front qui semblait plus grand, sa longue face mince, ses yeux vides, jadis un peu fous, où la folie s’était éteinte. Il aurait bien voulu l’embrasser, son cher petit, comme il l’avait nommé tant de fois, et il n’osa pas. Il se voyait couvert de son sang, il reculait devant l’horreur du destin. Ah ! quelle mort, sous l’effondrement de tout un monde ! Au dernier jour, sous les derniers débris de la Commune expirante, il avait donc fallu cette victime de plus ! Le pauvre être s’en était allé, affamé de justice, dans la suprême convulsion du grand rêve noir qu’il avait fait, cette grandiose et monstrueuse conception de la vieille société détruite, de Paris brûlé, du champ retourné et purifié, pour qu’il y poussât l’idylle d’un nouvel âge d’or.","But Jean had approached Maurice's body. He looked at him, with his big forehead that seemed bigger, his long thin face, his empty eyes, once a little crazy, where the madness had died out. He would have liked to kiss him, his dear little one, as he had called him so many times, and he dared not. He saw himself covered in his blood, he recoiled before the horror of fate. Ah! what death, under the collapse of a whole world! On the last day, under the last remains of the expiring Commune, this more victim had been needed! The poor being had gone away, hungry for justice, in the supreme convulsion of the great dark dream he had had, this grandiose and monstrous conception of the old society destroyed, of Paris burned, of the field turned over and purified, so that he grew there the idyll of a new golden age.","Yet Jean went over to Maurice’s body. He looked at him, and his lofty brow looked even more lofty, and from his long, thin face and expressionless eyes, formerly a bit wild, the wildness had gone. He would have liked to kiss his dear kid, as he had called him so many times, but he dared not. He saw himself covered with his blood, and recoiled before the horror of fate. What a death, beneath the ruins of a world! On the last day, amid the last bits of wreckage of the dying Commune, one more victim had been claimed! The poor man had departed still thirsting for justice in the final convulsion of the great dark dream he had dreamed, in the grandiose and monstrous conception of the destruction of the old society, Paris destroyed by fire, the field ploughed up and cleansed so that the idyll of a new golden age might spring up into life.","But Jean could not tear himself away thus. Advancing to the bedside he sorrowfully scanned the dead man's face, with its lofty forehead that seemed loftier still in death, its wasted features, its dull eyes, whence the wild look that had occasionally been seen there in life had vanished. He longed to give a parting kiss to his little one, as he had called him so many times, but dared not. It seemed to him that his hands were stained with his friend's blood; he shrank from the horror of the ordeal. Ah, what a death to die, amid the crashing ruins of a sinking world! On the last day, among the shattered fragments of the dying Commune, might not this last victim have been spared? He had gone from life, hungering for justice, possessed by the dream that haunted him, the sublime and unattainable conception of the destruction of the old society, of Paris chastened by fire, of the field dug up anew, that from the soil thus renewed and purified might spring the idyl of another golden age."
"Henriette avait absolument voulu accompagner Jean jusqu’à Sedan. Il était en bourgeois, avec un paletot et un chapeau rond, prêtés par le docteur. Ce jour-là, le soleil luisait sur la neige, par le grand froid terrible. On ne devait que traverser la ville ; mais, lorsque Jean sut que son colonel était toujours chez les Delaherche, une grande envie lui vint d’aller le saluer ; et, en même temps, il remercierait le fabricant de ses bontés. Ce fut sa dernière douleur, dans cette ville de désastre et de deuil. Comme ils arrivaient à la fabrique de la rue Maqua, une fin tragique y bouleversait la maison. Gilberte s’effarait, madame Delaherche pleurait de grosses larmes silencieuses, tandis que son fils, remonté de ses ateliers, où le travail avait un peu repris, poussait des exclamations de surprise. On venait de trouver le colonel, sur le parquet de sa chambre, tombé comme une masse, mort. L’éternelle lampe brûlait seule, dans la pièce close. Appelé en hâte, un médecin n’avait pas compris, ne découvrant aucune cause probable, ni anévrisme, ni congestion. Le colonel était mort, foudroyé, sans qu’on sût d’où était venue la foudre ; et, le lendemain seulement, on ramassa un morceau de vieux journal, qui avait servi de couverture à un livre, et où se trouvait le récit de la reddition de Metz.","Henriette had absolutely wanted to accompany Jean to Sedan. He was dressed as a citizen, with an overcoat and a round hat, lent by the doctor. That day, the sun shone on the snow, in the terrible cold. We only had to cross the town; but, when Jean learned that his colonel was still with the Delaherches, a great desire came to him to go and greet him; and, at the same time, he would thank the manufacturer for his kindness. It was his last pain, in this city of disaster and mourning. As they arrived at the factory in the rue Maqua, a tragic end shook the house there. Gilberte was startled, Madame Delaherche wept great silent tears, while her son, coming up from his workshops, where work had somewhat resumed, uttered exclamations of surprise. The colonel had just been found, on the floor of his room, fallen like a heap, dead. The eternal lamp burned alone, in the closed room. Hastily called, a doctor did not understand, discovering no probable cause, neither aneurysm nor congestion. The colonel was dead, struck down, no one knew where the lightning had come from; and only the next day they picked up a piece of old newspaper, which had served as the cover of a book, and in which was found the account of the surrender of Metz.","Henriette had insisted on going with Jean as far as Sedan. He was dressed like an ordinary civilian, in an overcoat and round felt hat lent by the doctor. On that day the sun was dazzling on the snow and it was bitterly cold. They were intending to go straight through the town without stopping, but when Jean realized that his colonel was still with the Delaherches he was filled with a great desire to go and see him and at the same time he could thank Monsieur Delaherche for his many kindnesses. This was to be his crowning distress in this town of disaster and grief. As they reached the mill in the rue Maqua they found the place turned upside down by a tragic end. Gilberte was in a flurry of dismay. Madame Delaherche said nothing but was weeping bitter tears, and her son had come up from the workshops, where work was coming back to normal, and was uttering exclamations of astonishment. The colonel had just been found on the floor of his room, where he had collapsed and died. The eternal lamp was burning alone in the closed room. A doctor summoned in haste had not understood why, for he could discover no likely cause such as an aneurism or stroke. He had been struck down as it were by a thunderbolt, but nobody knew whence it had fallen, and it was only the next day that they picked up a piece of an old newspaper that had been used to cover a book, and in it was a report on the fall of Metz.","Henriette would not let Jean go away without accompanying him as far as Sedan. He was in citizen's dress, wearing a frock coat and derby hat that the doctor had loaned him. The day was piercingly cold; the sun's rays were reflected from a crust of glittering snow. Their intention had been to pass through the city without stopping, but when Jean learned that his old colonel was still at the Delaherches' he felt an irresistible desire to go and pay his respects to him, and at the same time thank the manufacturer for his many kindnesses. His visit was destined to bring him an additional, a final sorrow, in that city of mournful memories. On reaching the structure in the Rue Maqua they found the household in a condition of the greatest distress and disorder, Gilberte wringing her hands, Madame Delaherche weeping great silent tears, while her son, who had come in from the factory, where work was gradually being resumed, uttered exclamations of surprise. The colonel had just been discovered, stone dead, lying exactly as he had fallen, in a heap on the floor of his chamber. The physician, who was summoned with all haste, could assign no cause for the sudden death; there was no indication of paralysis or heart trouble. The colonel had been stricken down, and no one could tell from what quarter the blow came; but the following morning, when the room was thrown open, a piece of an old newspaper was found, lying on the carpet, that had been wrapped around a book and contained the account of the surrender of Metz."
"– Weiss, nous partirons ensemble… Mais, en attendant, allons donc jusqu’à la Sous-Préfecture, nous apercevrons peut-être l’empereur.","– Weiss, we will leave together… But, in the meantime, let’s go to the Sub-Prefecture, we may see the Emperor.","‘Weiss, we’ll go there together, but first let us go down to the Sub-Prefecture where we might catch a glimpse of the Emperor.’","“We'll go together and be company for each other, Weiss. But first let's go as far as the Sous-Prefecture; we may be able to catch a glimpse of the Emperor.”"
"– Le plaisir a été pour moi, camarades ! répondit Maurice à Coutard et à Picot qui s’en allaient, en le remerciant de son fromage et de sa bouteille de vin.","""The pleasure was mine, comrades!"" replied Maurice to Coutard and Picot, who were leaving, thanking him for his cheese and his bottle of wine.","‘The pleasure was mine, chums,’ Maurice said to Coutard and Picot, who thanked him for his cheese and bottle of wine and went off.","“The pleasure was all mine, comrades!” Maurice replied to Coutard and Picot, who, as they were leaving, thanked him for the cheese and wine."
"Au bout de la route, à trois cents mètres environ, la place de l’Église était en ce moment attaquée par une forte colonne bavaroise, qui débouchait du chemin de Douzy. Le régiment d’infanterie de marine chargé de défendre la place parut un instant ralentir le feu, comme pour la laisser s’avancer. Puis, tout d’un coup, quand elle fut massée bien en face, il y eut une manœuvre extraordinaire et imprévue : les soldats s’étaient rejetés aux deux bords de la route, beaucoup se couchaient par terre ; et, dans le brusque espace qui s’ouvrait ainsi, les mitrailleuses, mises en batterie à l’autre bout, vomirent une grêle de balles. La colonne ennemie en fut comme balayée. Les soldats s’étaient relevés d’un bond, couraient à la baïonnette sur les Bavarois épars, achevaient de les pousser et de les culbuter. Deux fois, la manœuvre recommença, avec le même succès. À l’angle d’une ruelle, dans une petite maison, trois femmes étaient restées ; et, tranquillement, à une des fenêtres, elles riaient, elles applaudissaient, l’air amusé d’être au spectacle.","At the end of the road, about three hundred yards away, the Place de l'Eglise was at this moment attacked by a strong Bavarian column, which debouched from the road to Douzy. The marine infantry regiment in charge of defending the place seemed for a moment to slow down the fire, as if to let it advance. Then, all of a sudden, when it was massed right in front of it, there was an extraordinary and unforeseen manoeuvre: the soldiers had fled to the two sides of the road, many were lying on the ground; and, in the space thus suddenly opened up, the machine-guns, placed in battery at the other end, vomited a hail of bullets. The enemy column was swept away. The soldiers jumped to their feet, ran with bayonets on the scattered Bavarians, pushed and knocked them over. Twice the maneuver was repeated, with the same success. At the corner of an alley, in a little house, three women had remained; and, quietly, at one of the windows, they laughed, they applauded, with the amused air of being at the show.","At the end of the street, about three hundred metres away, the Place de l’Eglise was being attacked by a strong force of Bavarians coming from the Douzy road. The regiment of marines responsible for defending the square appeared to slacken fire for a moment as if to let them advance. Then suddenly, when they were massed right in front of them, there was an extraordinary and unforeseen manoeuvre: the French soldiers threw themselves to one side or the other of the road and many lay flat on the ground, and, through the space thus suddenly opened, the machine guns, concentrated in a battery at the other end, suddenly belched forth a hail of bullets, sweeping the enemy force away. The soldiers leaped up again with one bound and charged with bayonets on the scattered Bavarians, which pushed and toppled them right back. Twice the process was repeated with the same success. At the corner of a narrow lane three women were still in a little house and there, in one of the windows, they were calmly laughing and applauding, apparently delighted to see the show.","At the end of the street, some three hundred yards from where they stood, a strong Bavarian column had debouched from the Douzy road and was charging up the Place de l'Eglise. The square was held by a regiment of sailor-boys, who appeared to slacken their fire for a moment as if with the intention of drawing their assailants on; then, when the close-massed column was directly opposite their front, a most surprising maneuver was swiftly executed: the men abandoned their formation, some of them stepping from the ranks and flattening themselves against the house fronts, others casting themselves prone upon the ground, and down the vacant space thus suddenly formed the mitrailleuses that had been placed in battery at the farther end poured a perfect hailstorm of bullets. The column disappeared as if it had been swept bodily from off the face of the earth. The recumbent men sprang to their feet with a bound and charged the scattered Bavarians with the bayonet, driving them and making the rout complete. Twice the maneuver was repeated, each time with the same success. Two women, unwilling to abandon their home, a small house at the corner of an intersecting lane, were sitting at their window; they laughed approvingly and clapped their hands, apparently glad to have an opportunity to behold such a spectacle."
"– Eh ! camarades, par ici !… Mais vous êtes du 7e corps, vous !","– Hey! comrades, this way!... But you are from the 7th corps, you!","‘Come over here, mates… But you belong to the 7th corps!’","“Hallo there, comrades, this way! You are 7th corps men, aren't you?”"

"Des larmes lui emplissaient les yeux, au souvenir de ses folies. Son beau-frère, ému lui-même, coupa court, en s’adressant à Honoré Fouchard, l’artilleur.","Tears filled her eyes, remembering her follies. His brother-in-law, moved himself, cut him short, addressing Honoré Fouchard, the artilleryman.","Tears came into his eyes as he thought of his follies.

"De cette hauteur de la butte des Moulins, toute une grande moitié de Paris s’étendait sous eux, d’abord les quartiers du centre, du faubourg Saint-Honoré jusqu’à la Bastille, puis le cours entier de la Seine, avec le pullulement lointain de la rive gauche, une mer de toitures, de cimes d’arbres, de clochers, de dômes et de tours. Le jour grandissait, l’abominable nuit, une des plus affreuses de l’histoire, était finie. Mais, dans la pure clarté du soleil levant, sous le ciel rose, les incendies continuaient. En face, on apercevait les Tuileries qui brûlaient toujours, la caserne d’Orsay, les palais du Conseil d’État et de la Légion d’Honneur, dont les flammes, pâlies par la pleine lumière, donnaient au ciel un grand frisson. Même, au delà des maisons de la rue de Lille et de la rue du Bac, d’autres maisons devaient flamber, car des colonnes de flammèches montaient du carrefour de la Croix-Rouge, et plus loin encore, de la rue Vavin et de la rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs. Sur la droite, tout près, s’achevaient les incendies de la rue Saint-Honoré, tandis que, sur la gauche, au Palais-Royal et au nouveau Louvre, avortaient des feux tardifs, mis vers le matin. Mais, surtout, ce qu’ils ne s’expliquèrent pas d’abord, c’était une grosse fumée noire que le vent d’ouest poussait jusque sous la fenêtre. Depuis trois heures du matin, le ministère des Finances brûlait, sans flammes hautes, se consumait en épais tourbillons de suie, tellement le prodigieux amas des paperasses s’étouffait, sous les plafonds bas, dans ces constructions de plâtre. Et, s’il n’y avait plus là, au-dessus du réveil de la grande ville, l’impression tragique de la nuit, l’épouvante d’une destruction totale, la Seine roulant des braises, Paris allumé aux quatre bouts, une tristesse désespérée et morne passait sur les quartiers épargnés, avec cette épaisse fumée continue, dont le nuage s’élargissait toujours. Bientôt le soleil, qui s’était levé limpide, en fut caché ; et il ne resta que ce deuil, dans le ciel fauve.","From this height of the Butte des Moulins, a whole large half of Paris stretched out beneath them, first the central districts, from the Faubourg Saint-Honoré to the Bastille, then the entire course of the Seine, with the distant swarming of the left bank, a sea of roofs, treetops, steeples, domes and towers. The day was growing, the abominable night, one of the most dreadful in history, was over. But, in the pure light of the rising sun, under the pink sky, the fires continued. Opposite, you could see the Tuileries which were still burning, the barracks of Orsay, the palaces of the Council of State and the Legion of Honor, whose flames, paled by the full light, gave the sky a great shiver. Even beyond the houses in the rue de Lille and the rue du Bac, other houses must have gone up in flames, for columns of sparks rose from the crossroads of the Croix-Rouge, and further still, from the rue Vavin and rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs. On the right, very close, the fires in the rue Saint-Honoré ended, while, on the left, at the Palais-Royal and the new Louvre, late fires aborted, set towards morning. But, above all, what they did not explain at first was a big black smoke that the west wind was pushing right under the window. Since three o'clock in the morning, the Ministry of Finance had been burning, without high flames, was consumed in thick whirlwinds of soot, so smothered was the prodigious heap of paperwork, under the low ceilings, in these plaster constructions. And, if there were no longer there, above the awakening of the big city, the tragic impression of the night, the terror of total destruction, the Seine rolling with embers, Paris lit at the four ends , a desperate and gloomy sadness passed over the spared quarters, with this thick continuous smoke, the cloud of which grew ever wider. Soon the sun, which had risen limpid, was hidden from it; and there remained only this mourning, in the wild sky.","From this high position on the Butte des Moulins quite half of Paris stretched out below them, first the central area from the Faubourg Saint-Honoré as far as the Bastille, then the whole course of the Seine with the distant busy life of the left bank, a sea of roofs, treetops, steeples, domes and towers. It was getting much lighter, and that unspeakable night, one of the most terrible in history, was over. But in the pure light of the rising sun, under the rose-pink sky, the fires went on burning. Straight opposite them the Tuileries was still burning, and the flames, and those of the Orsay barracks, the palaces of the Conseil d’Etat and the Legion of Honour, scarcely visible in the strong light, made the air quiver. Even beyond the houses in the rue de Lille and the rue du Bac other buildings must be burning, for columns of sparks were going up from the Croix-Rouge crossroads, and still further away in the rue Vavin and rue Notre-Dame des Champs. Quite near, to the right, the fires in the rue Saint-Honoré were burning themselves out and to the left, at the Palais-Royal and new Louvre, later fires lit in the small hours were petering out. But the thing they could not understand at first was dense black smoke that the west wind was blowing right under their window. Since three in the morning the Ministry of Finance had been burning, but without any high flames, in thick clouds of soot, because there were such enormous masses of paper in low-ceilinged rooms in a rough-cast building. It was true that the great city, awakening to a new day, no longer gave the tragic impression of the night, the horror of total destruction, with the Seine a river of blazing fire and Paris lit up from end to end, but now a hopeless, dreary misery hovered over the districts that had been spared, with this continual thick smoke in an ever-widening cloud. Soon the sun, which had come up clear and bright, was hidden by it, leaving nothing but gloom in the menacing sky.","From that elevated point of the Butte des Moulins a good half of Paris lay stretched beneath their eyes in a vast panorama: first the central districts, from the Faubourg Saint-Honore to the Bastille, then the Seine in its entire course through the city, with the thickly-built, densely-populated regions of the left bank, an ocean of roofs, treetops, steeples, domes, and towers. The light was growing stronger, the abominable night, than which there have been few more terrible in history, was ended; but beneath the rosy sky, in the pure, clear light of the rising sun, the fires were blazing still. Before them lay the burning Tuileries, the d'Orsay barracks, the Palaces of the Council of State and the Legion of Honor, the flames from which were paled by the superior refulgence of the day-star. Even beyond the houses in the Rue de Lille and the Rue du Bac there must have been other structures burning, for clouds of smoke were visible rising from the carrefour of la Croix-Rouge, and, more distant still, from the Rue Vavin and the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs. Nearer at hand and to their right the fires in the Rue Saint-Honore were dying out, while to the left, at the Palais-Royal and the new Louvre, to which the torch had not been applied until near morning, the work of the incendiaries was apparently a failure. But what they were unable to account for at first was the dense volume of black smoke which, impelled by the west wind, came driving past their window. Fire had been set to the Ministry of Finance at three o'clock in the morning and ever since that time it had been smoldering, emitting no blaze, among the stacks and piles of documents that were contained in the low-ceiled, fire-proof vaults and chambers. And if the terrific impressions of the night were not there to preside at the awakening of the great city —the fear of total destruction, the Seine pouring its fiery waves past their doors, Paris kindling into flame from end to end—a feeling of gloom and despair, hung heavy over the quartiers that had been spared, with that dense, on-pouring smoke, whose dusky cloud was ever spreading. Presently the sun, which had risen bright and clear, was hid by it, and the golden sky was filled with the great funeral pall."
"Au bruit, elle leva la tête, elle eut un frisson, à voir entrer Jean. Lui, éperdu, allait se précipiter, prendre ses mains, mêler d’une étreinte sa douleur à la sienne. Mais il sentit les petites mains tremblantes, tout l’être frémissant et révolté qui se reculait, qui s’arrachait, à jamais. N’était-ce pas fini entre eux, maintenant ? La tombe de Maurice les séparait, sans fond. Et lui aussi ne put que tomber à genoux, en sanglotant tout bas.","At the noise, she raised her head, she shuddered to see Jean enter. He, distraught, was about to rush up, take her hands, mingle his pain with hers in an embrace. But he felt the trembling little hands, the whole quivering and rebellious being which drew back, which tore itself away, forever. Wasn't it over between them now? Maurice's tomb separated them, bottomless. And he too could only fall to his knees, sobbing softly.","Hearing a noise she looked up and seeing Jean enter shuddered visibly. He, distraught with grief, was on the point of rushing forward and taking her hands to unite his sorrow and hers in an embrace. But he felt her little trembling hands, her whole being chilled and repelled, recoiling, snatching herself away for ever. Was it not all over between them now? Maurice’s grave separated them for ever, like a bottomless abyss. All he too could do was fall on his knees, quietly sobbing.","At the noise of footsteps she raised her head, and shuddered on beholding Jean. He, in his wild despair, was about to hurry toward her and seize her hands, mingle his grief with hers in a sympathetic clasp, but he saw the little hands were trembling, he felt as by instinct the repulsion that pervaded all her being and was to part them for evermore. Was not all ended between them now? Maurice's grave would be there, a yawning chasm, to part them as long as they should live. And he could only fall to his knees by the bedside of his dead friend, sobbing softly."

"Il se calma, il eut un abandon d’épaules, plein d’accablement.","He calmed down, his shoulders dropped, full of despondency.","His emotion subsided, and he slumped his shoulders in utter weariness.","He became calmer, allowing his arms to fall by his side in discouragement."
"La vieille dame, qui l’aimait pourtant, eut un geste de colère.","The old lady, who nevertheless loved him, gave a gesture of anger.","The old lady, although she was fond of Henriette, made an angry gesture.","The old lady, although she had a sincere affection for Henriette, could scarce conceal her anger as she replied:"
"À cette parole, le cœur de Maurice s’était serré, dans l’angoisse du souvenir. Il se rappelait cette fuite imbécile, cette panique qui avait emporté le 7e corps, sans qu’un Allemand eût paru, à dix lieues de là. Et l’aventure recommençait, il en avait maintenant la sensation nette, la certitude. Pour que l’ennemi ne les eût pas attaqués, vingt-quatre heures après l’escarmouche de Grand-Pré, il fallait que le 4e hussards s’y fût heurté simplement à quelque reconnaissance de cavalerie. Les colonnes devaient être loin encore, peut-être à deux journées de marche. Tout d’un coup, cette pensée le terrifia, lorsqu’il réfléchit au temps qu’on venait de perdre. En trois jours, on n’avait pas fait deux lieues, de Contreuve à Vouziers. Le 25 et le 26, les autres corps d’armée étaient montés au nord, sous prétexte de se ravitailler ; tandis que, maintenant, le 27, les voilà qui descendaient au midi, pour accepter une bataille que personne ne leur offrait. À la suite du 4e hussards, vers les défilés de l’Argonne abandonnés, la brigade Bordas s’était crue perdue, entraînant à son secours toute la division, puis le 7e corps, puis l’armée entière, inutilement. Et Maurice, songeait au prix inestimable de chaque heure, dans ce projet fou de donner la main à Bazaine, un plan que, seul, un général de génie aurait pu exécuter, avec des soldats solides, à la condition d’aller en tempête, droit devant lui, au travers des obstacles.","At this word, Maurice's heart sank in the anguish of remembrance. He remembered that foolish flight, that panic which had swept away the 7th Corps, without a German having appeared, ten leagues away. And the adventure was beginning again, he now had the clear feeling of it, the certainty. For the enemy not to have attacked them, twenty-four hours after the skirmish at Grand-Pré, the 4th Hussars must have simply come up against some reconnaissance cavalry there. The columns must still be a long way off, perhaps two days' march. Suddenly, this thought terrified him, when he reflected on the time we had just lost. In three days we had not covered two leagues, from Contreuve to Vouziers. On the 25th and 26th, the other army corps had gone up to the north, under the pretext of revictualling; whereas now, on the 27th, they were descending to the south, to accept a battle that no one offered them. Following the 4th Hussars, towards the abandoned defiles of the Argonne, the Bordas brigade had thought itself lost, dragging to its aid the entire division, then the 7th corps, then the entire army, uselessly. And Maurice thought of the inestimable price of each hour, in this mad project of joining hands with Bazaine, a plan which only a general of genius could have executed, with solid soldiers, on condition of storming. straight ahead, through obstacles.","This wrung Maurice’s heart with bitter memories. He recalled that idiotic flight and panic that had swept the 7th corps along without a single German being seen for ten leagues around. And now it was all starting again, he felt it quite clearly, with no mistake about it. Now that the enemy had not attacked twenty-four hours after the skirmish at Grand-Pré it must have been that the 4th hussars simply ran into some mounted reconnaissance. The main forces must still be a long way off, possibly even two days’ march. All at once this thought horrified him as he considered how much time had been lost. In three days they had not covered two leagues, from Contreuve to Vouziers. On the 25th and 26th the other army corps had gone northwards on the pretext that they had to restock with foodstuffs, whereas now, on the 27th, lo and behold they were going southwards to accept a challenge nobody was offering. Following the 4th hussars towards the abandoned passes in the Argonne, the Bordas brigade had thought it was lost and dragged in the whole division to help, then the 7th corps and then the whole army, all to no purpose. Maurice thought of the inestimable value of each hour in this wild scheme of joining up with Bazaine, a plan which none but a general of genius could have carried out, and with seasoned troops, on condition that he took everything by storm, straight ahead through every obstacle.","The words recalled to Maurice's mind a flood of bitter memories. He thought of that idiotic flight, that panic that had swept away the 7th corps when there was not a German visible, nor within ten leagues of where they were, and now he had a distinct certainty that they were to have a renewal of that experience. It was plain that if twenty-four hours had elapsed since the skirmish at Grand-Pre and they had not been attacked, the reason was that the 4th hussars had merely struck up against a reconnoitering body of cavalry; the main body of the Prussians must be far away, probably a day's march or two. Then the thought suddenly struck him of the time they had wasted, and it terrified him; in three days they had only accomplished the distance from Contreuve to Vouziers, a scant two leagues. On the 25th the other corps, alleging scarcity of supplies, had diverted their course to the north, while now, on the 27th, here they were coming southward again to fight a battle with an invisible enemy. Bordas' brigade had followed the 4th hussars into the abandoned passes of the Argonne, and was supposed to have got itself into trouble; the division had gone to its assistance, and that had been succeeded by the corps, and that by the entire army, and all those movements had amounted to nothing. Maurice trembled as he reflected how pricelessly valuable was every hour, every minute, in that mad project of joining forces with Bazaine, a project that could be carried to a successful issue only by an officer of genius, with seasoned troops under him, who should press forward to his end with the resistless energy of a whirlwind, crushing every obstacle that lay in his path."
"– Hein ? les cochons ! sont-ils assez crétins ! De fameux lièvres qu’on nous a donnés là ! S’ils se sont cavalés ainsi, quand il n’y avait personne, hein ? auraient-ils pris leurs jambes à leur cou, s’ils s’étaient trouvés en face d’une vraie armée !","- Eh ? pigs ! are they stupid enough! Famous hares that we were given there! If they ran away like that, when there was no one, huh? would they have taken to their heels if they had found themselves face to face with a real army!","‘What, those swine?

"Henriette, dont le malaise avait grandi, ne put rester davantage. C’était, en elle, une irritation sans cause précise, un besoin de ne plus être là ; et elle se leva doucement, elle sortit, à la recherche de Gilberte, qui se faisait si longtemps attendre.","Henriette, whose discomfort had increased, could not stay longer. It was, in her, an irritation without precise cause, a need not to be there any more; and she rose gently, she went out, in search of Gilberte, who had been waiting for so long.","Henriette, who had grown more and more embarrassed, could not stay there any longer. She felt an irritation without any clear reason, a need not to be there, so she rose softly and went to look for Gilberte, who had kept her waiting so long.","Henriette, whose feeling of distress had been increasing, could stand their talk no longer. She could assign no definite reason for the sensation of inquietude that possessed her; it was only a longing to get away, and she rose and left the room quietly in quest of Gilberte, whose absence had been so long protracted."

"Les yeux de M. de Vineuil s’étaient refermés, un long frisson l’agita, pendant que cette lamentation sourde lui échappait :","M. de Vineuil's eyes had closed again, a long shudder shook him, while this dull lamentation escaped him:",Monsieur de Vineuil shut his eyes again and he gave a long shudder and moaned softly:,"M. de Vineuil's eyes closed again, his long frame was shaken with a protracted shiver of supremely bitter grief, and this deep, long-drawn moan escaped his lips:"

Death!’","“All I have to say,” shouted the Provencal, “is that we are wasting a deal of breath in settling that scoundrel's hash.

"Dix jours après la bataille, on avait encore amené des blessés, oubliés, retrouvés dans les coins. Quatre étaient restés dans une maison vide de Balan, sans aucun soin médical, vivant on ne savait comment, grâce à la charité de quelque voisin sans doute ; et leurs blessures fourmillaient de vers, ils étaient morts, empoisonnés par ces plaies immondes. C’était cette purulence que rien ne pouvait combattre, qui soufflait et vidait des rangées de lits. Dès la porte, une odeur de nécrose prenait à la gorge. Les drains suppuraient, laissaient tomber goutte à goutte le pus fétide. Souvent, il fallait rouvrir les chairs, en extraire encore des esquilles ignorées. Puis, des abcès se déclaraient, des flux qui allaient crever plus loin. Épuisés, amaigris, la face terreuse, les misérables enduraient toutes les tortures. Les uns, abattus, sans souffle, passaient leurs journées sur le dos, les paupières closes et noires, ainsi que des cadavres à demi décomposés déjà. Les autres, sans sommeil, agités d’une insomnie inquiète, trempés d’abondantes sueurs, s’exaltaient, comme si la catastrophe les eût frappés de folie. Et, qu’ils fussent violents ou calmes, quand le frisson de la fièvre infectieuse les gagnait, c’était la fin, le poison triomphant, volant des uns aux autres, les emportant tous dans le même flot de pourriture victorieuse.","Ten days after the battle, more wounded had been brought in, forgotten, found in the corners. Four had remained in an empty house in Balan, without any medical care, living somehow, thanks to the charity of some neighbor no doubt; and their wounds swarmed with worms, they were dead, poisoned by these filthy wounds. It was this purulence that nothing could fight, which blew and emptied rows of beds. From the door, a smell of necrosis took in the throat. The drains festered, dripping fetid pus. Often, it was necessary to reopen the flesh, to extract even more ignored splinters. Then, abscesses broke out, flows that would burst further on. Exhausted, emaciated, with earthy faces, the wretches endured all the tortures. Some, dejected, breathless, passed their days on their backs, their eyelids closed and black, like corpses already half decomposed. The others, sleepless, agitated by an uneasy insomnia, drenched in profuse sweats, were elated, as if the catastrophe had struck them with madness. And whether they were violent or calm, when the shiver of infectious fever overcame them, it was the end, the triumphant poison, flying from one to another, carrying them all away in the same wave of victorious decay.","Even ten days after the battle wounded had still been brought in, forgotten men found in odd corners. Four had stayed in an empty house at Balan with no medical attention whatever, living God knows how but probably thanks to the charity of some neighbour; and their wounds were crawling with maggots and they had died, poisoned by their own filthy sores. This purulence, which nothing could check, raged through the place and emptied rows of beds. As soon as you reached the door a smell of necrosis caught you by the throat. Drainage tubes suppurated, dripping fetid pus drop by drop. Often flesh had to be reopened to get out still more unsuspected splinters of bone. Then abscesses appeared, that were going to discharge in some other part of the body. The wretched men, exhausted, emaciated, their faces grey, endured every kind of torture. Some, prostrate and scarcely able to breathe, spent all their days on their backs with eyelids closed and black, like corpses already half decomposed. Others, the sleepless ones, plagued with restless insomnia and soaked in copious sweat, got wildly excited as though the catastrophe had driven them out of their minds. And whether they were violent or inert, once the shivering of infectious fever seized them it was all over, the poison won, flitting from the one to the other and carrying them all off in the same tide of victorious corruption.","As late even as ten days after the battle wounded men had been discovered in obscure corners, where they had been overlooked, and brought in for treatment. There were four who had crawled into a vacant house at Balan and remained there, without attendance, kept from starving in some way, no one could tell how, probably by the charity of some kind-hearted neighbor, and their wounds were alive with maggots; they were as dead men, their system poisoned by the corruption that exuded from their wounds. There was a purulency, that nothing could check or overcome, that hovered over the rows of beds and emptied them. As soon as the door was passed one's nostrils were assailed by the odor of mortifying flesh. From drains inserted in festering sores fetid matter trickled, drop by drop. Oftentimes it became necessary to reopen old wounds in order to extract a fragment of bone that had been overlooked. Then abscesses would form, to break out after an interval in some remote portion of the body. Their strength all gone, reduced to skeletons, with ashen, clayey faces, the miserable wretches suffered the torments of the damned. Some, so weakened they could scarcely draw their breath, lay all day long upon their back, with tight shut, darkened eyes, like corpses in which decomposition had already set in; while others, denied the boon of sleep, tossing in restless wakefulness, drenched with the cold sweat that streamed from every pore, raved like lunatics, as if their suffering had made them mad. And whether they were calm or violent, it mattered not; when the contagion of the fever reached them, then was the end at hand, the poison doing its work, flying from bed to bed, sweeping them all away in one mass of corruption."
"Et le petit raconta, avec des gestes, agitant son pain.","And the little one told, with gestures, waving his bread.","The smaller one told him, waving his bread about by way of illustration.","And the little man told his story with many gestures, describing figures on the air with his bread."
"Il avait reçu, sur le sommet de la tête, comme un fort coup de marteau, et son képi, déchiré, emporté, gisait derrière lui. D’abord, il crut que son crâne était ouvert, qu’il avait la cervelle à nu. Pendant quelques secondes, il n’osa y porter la main, certain de trouver là un trou. Puis, s’étant hasardé, il ramena ses doigts rouges d’un épais flot de sang. Et la sensation fut si forte, qu’il s’évanouit.","He had received, on the top of the head, a strong blow from a hammer, and his kepi, torn, blown off, lay behind him. At first he thought his skull was split open, that his brains were bare. For a few seconds, he dared not put his hand there, certain to find a hole there. Then, having ventured, he drew his fingers red with a thick stream of blood. And the sensation was so strong that he fainted.","It had been like a violent hammer-blow on the top of his head, and his képi was knocked off and lay in shreds on the ground behind him. For a moment he thought his skull was open and his brains exposed, and for a second or two he dared not feel with his hand for he was certain there would be a hole. When he did venture his fingers came away red from a copious bleeding. The pain was so terrible that he fainted.","He had received what seemed to him like a smart blow of a hammer on the crown of his head, and his kepi lay behind him with a great furrow plowed through its top. At first he thought that the bullet had certainly penetrated the skull and laid bare the brain; his dread of finding a yawning orifice there was so great that for some seconds he dared not raise his hand to ascertain the truth. When finally he ventured, his fingers, on withdrawing them, were red with an abundant flow of blood, and the pain was so intense that he fainted."

One does not thus send a regiment in the air, without supporting it immediately.","‘It’s ridiculous, ridiculous!’ Captain Beaudoin kept on saying as he went on with his jerky walking up and down. ‘You don’t send a regiment up into the air like this without supporting it immediately.’","“It is absurd, ridiculous!” declared Beaudoin, who was again fidgeting up and down before the company. “Who ever heard of placing a regiment in the air like this and giving it no support!”"

"N’était-ce point l’empereur, avec tout un état-major ? Il hésitait, bien qu’il se vantât de le connaître, depuis qu’il avait failli lui parler, à Baybel ; puis, il resta béant. C’était bien Napoléon III, qui lui apparaissait plus grand, à cheval, et les moustaches si fortement cirées, les joues si colorées, qu’il le jugea tout de suite rajeuni, fardé comme un acteur. Sûrement, il s’était fait peindre, pour ne pas promener, parmi son armée, l’effroi de son masque blême, décomposé par la souffrance, au nez aminci, aux yeux troubles. Et, averti dès cinq heures qu’on se battait à Bazeilles, il était venu, de son air silencieux et morne de fantôme, aux chairs ravivées de vermillon.","Was it not the Emperor, with a whole staff? He hesitated, though he boasted of knowing him, since he had nearly spoken to him at Baybel; then he gaped. It was indeed Napoleon III, who seemed to him taller, on horseback, and with his mustaches so strongly waxed, his cheeks so tinted, that he thought him immediately rejuvenated, made up like an actor. Surely he had had his face depicted, so as not to parade among his army the terror of his pale mask, disfigured by suffering, with its thinned nose, and cloudy eyes. And, warned at five o'clock that they were fighting at Bazeilles, he had come, with his silent and gloomy air of a phantom, with flesh revived with vermilion.","Surely it was the Emperor with all his staff? For all the personal knowledge he had been boasting about since he nearly spoke to him at Baybel, he hesitated, and then stood gaping. It was indeed Napoleon III, who looked taller now that he was on horseback, and his moustache was so waxed and his cheeks were so rouged that he at once thought he looked much younger, and made up like an actor. Surely he must have had himself made up so as not to go round displaying to the army the horror of his colourless face all twisted with pain, his fleshless nose and muddy eyes. Having been warned at five in the morning that there was fighting at Bazeilles, he had come like a silent, gloomy ghost with its flesh all brightened up with vermilion.","Was not that the Emperor, attended by his brilliant staff? He hesitated, although for the last two days he had been boasting of his acquaintance with him, then stood staring, open-mouthed. It was indeed Napoleon III. ; he appeared larger, somehow, and more imposing on horseback, and his mustache was so stiffly waxed, there was such a brilliant color on his cheeks, that Delaherche saw at once he had been “made up” and painted like an actor. He had had recourse to cosmetics to conceal from his army the ravages that anxiety and illness had wrought in his countenance, the ghastly pallor of his face, his pinched nose, his dull, sunken eyes, and having been notified at five o'clock that there was fighting at Bazeilles, had come forth to see, sadly and silently, like a phantom with rouged cheeks."

"Le clairon de Gaude sonnait, impérieux. Ce fut une consternation, une colère sourde. Eh quoi ! partir sans manger, ne pas attendre une heure que la soupe fût possible ! L’escouade voulut quand même boire le bouillon ; mais ce n’était encore que de l’eau chaude ; et la viande, pas cuite, résistait, pareille à du cuir sous les dents. Chouteau grogna des paroles rageuses. Jean dut intervenir, afin de hâter les préparatifs de ses hommes. Qu’y avait-il donc de si pressé, à filer ainsi, à bousculer les gens, sans leur laisser le temps de reprendre des forces ? Et, comme, devant Maurice, on disait qu’on marchait à la rencontre des Prussiens, pour la revanche, il haussa les épaules, incrédule. En moins d’un quart d’heure, le camp fut levé, les tentes pliées, rattachées sur les sacs, les faisceaux défaits, et il ne resta, sur la terre nue, que les feux des cuisines qui achevaient de s’éteindre.","Gaude's bugle sounded, imperious. There was consternation, a dull anger. Oh what! leaving without eating, not waiting an hour for the soup to be possible! The squad still wanted to drink the broth; but it was still only hot water; and the meat, uncooked, resisted, like leather under the teeth. Chouteau growled angry words. Jean had to intervene, in order to hasten the preparations of his men. So what was so rushed, running away like this, pushing people around, without giving them time to regain their strength? And, as, in front of Maurice, it was said that they were marching to meet the Prussians, for revenge, he shrugged his shoulders incredulously. In less than a quarter of an hour, the camp was up, the tents folded, reattached to the sacks, the beams undone, and there remained, on the bare earth, only the kitchen fires which were dying out.","Gaude blew an imperious call on his bugle. There was consternation and sullen anger. What, leave without food! Not wait even one hour until the stew was eatable! The squad was for drinking the broth anyway, but so far it was nothing but hot water and the uncooked meat was impenetrable, like leather between your teeth. Chouteau muttered terrible oaths. Jean had to intervene and hurry his men on with the preparations. What was all the hurry, then? Clearing off like this, shoving people about with no time to get their strength back! Somebody said in Maurice’s hearing that they were marching to meet the Prussians and take their revenge, but he shrugged his shoulders in disbelief. Camp was struck in less than a quarter of an hour, tents folded and strapped on to packs, piles of arms dismantled, and nothing was left on the bare ground but the cooking fires dying down.","Gaude's bugle rang out in imperious accents. Then everywhere was consternation; dumb, deep rage was depicted on every countenance. What, march on an empty stomach! Could they not wait a little hour until the soup was ready! The squad resolved that their bouillon should not go to waste, but it was only so much hot water, and the uncooked meat was like leather to their teeth. Chouteau growled and grumbled, almost mutinously. Jean had to exert all his authority to make the men hasten their preparations. What was the great urgency that made it necessary for them to hurry off like that? What good was there in hazing people about in that style, without giving them time to regain their strength? And Maurice shrugged his shoulders incredulously when someone said in his hearing that they were about to march against the Prussians and settle old scores with them. In less than fifteen minutes the tents were struck, folded, and strapped upon the knapsacks, the stacks were broken, and all that remained of the camp was the dying embers of the fires on the bare ground."
"– Dame ! ça me semble indiqué… Il faudrait qu’il ne fût guère curieux, puisqu’il n’a jamais vu le petit, tout en sachant qu’il existe… Et, en outre, il y a vous, pas plus laide que ça, qui êtes bonne à revoir.","- Lady ! that seems appropriate to me... He shouldn't be very curious, since he's never seen the little one, even though he knows he exists... And, besides, there's you, no uglier than that, who are good to see again.","‘Do you think he’ll come here?’ ‘Well of course, it seems obvious to me… He would have to be very lacking in curiosity, as he has never set eyes on the kid, although he knows he exists… And besides, there’s you, and you’re not all that bad-looking, and nice to see again.’","“Dame! it appears to me extremely probable he will. It would show great lack of curiosity if he didn't, since he knows he has a young one here that he has never seen. And then there's you, besides, and you're not so very homely but he might like to have another look at you.”"

"Il s’était remis debout, il montrait le poing aux Bavarois, dont les casques commençaient à reparaître, du côté de l’église.

And the sight of the roof of his house, half punctured by the fall of the chimney, completed throwing him into mad exasperation.",He was now standing up again and shaking his fist at the Bavarians whose helmets were beginning to reappear by the church. The sight of the roof of his house half stove-in by the falling chimney put the finishing touch to his mad fury.,"He had risen to his feet; he shook his fist at the Bavarians, whose braid-trimmed helmets were commencing to appear again in the direction of the church. The chimney, in falling, had crushed a great hole in the roof of his house, and the sight of the havoc made him furious."
"Lentement, Maurice s’était relevé. Il se tâtait, n’avait rien, pas une égratignure. Pourquoi donc ne fuyait-il pas ? Il était temps encore, il pouvait atteindre le petit mur en quelques sauts, et ce serait le salut. La peur renaissait, l’affolait. D’un bond, il prenait sa course, lorsque des liens plus forts que la mort le retinrent. Non ! ce n’était pas possible, il ne pouvait abandonner Jean. Toute sa chair en aurait saigné, la fraternité qui avait grandi entre ce paysan et lui, allait au fond de son être, à la racine même de la vie. Cela remontait peut-être aux premiers jours du monde, et c’était aussi comme s’il n’y avait plus eu que deux hommes, dont l’un n’aurait pu renoncer à l’autre, sans renoncer à lui-même.","Slowly, Maurice got up. He felt himself, had nothing, not a scratch. Why didn't he run away? There was still time, he could reach the small wall in a few jumps, and that would be salvation. Fear reappeared, maddened him. With a bound, he was on his way, when bonds stronger than death held him back. Nope ! it was not possible, he could not abandon Jean. All his flesh would have bled, the fraternity which had grown between this peasant and him, went to the bottom of his being, to the very root of life. It may have gone back to the earliest days of the world, and it was also as if there were only two men left, one of whom could not give up the other, without giving up himself. .","But he slowly got up again, felt himself all over, nothing wrong, not a scratch. Why not run away? There was still time, he could reach that low wall in a few bounds and would be safe. His fear came back and was turning into panic. He took one leap and was rushing away when he was checked by a bond stronger than death. No, it was impossible, he couldn’t abandon Jean. His whole body would have bled, the brotherly love that had grown up between this peasant and himself went down into the depths of his being, the very root of life itself. Perhaps it went back to the earliest days of the world, and it was as if there were only two men left in existence, and the one could not abandon the other without abandoning himself.","Slowly, cautiously, Maurice picked himself up. He felt his body, arms, and legs; nothing, not a scratch. Why should he not look out for himself and fly, alone? There was time left still; a few bounds would take him to the wall and he would be saved. His horrible sensation of fear returned and made him frantic. He was collecting his energies to break away and run, when a feeling stronger than death intervened and vanquished the base impulse. What, abandon Jean! he could not do it. It would be like mutilating his own being; the brotherly affection that had bourgeoned and grown between him and that rustic had struck its roots down into his life, too deep to be slain like that. The feeling went back to the earliest days, was perhaps as old as the world itself; it was as if there were but they two upon earth, of whom one could not forsake the other without forsaking himself, and being doomed thenceforth to an eternity of solitude. Molded of the same clay, quickened by the same spirit, duty imperiously commanded to save himself in saving his brother."
"– Bah ! conclut Jean, elle est très gentille, sa lettre, et ça fait plaisir d’avoir des nouvelles… Il ne faut jamais désespérer.","- Bah ! concludes Jean, she is very nice, her letter, and it's nice to have news... You must never despair.","‘Ah well,’ Jean concluded, ‘it’s a very nice letter and it’s a pleasure to get news… We mustn’t ever despair.’","“Bah!” rejoined Jean, “that's a very nice letter of his, and it's a comfort to have heard from him. We must not despair.”"
"Les jours suivants, Maurice oublia d’abord, au milieu des événements extraordinaires qui se précipitaient. Le 19, Paris s’était réveillé sans gouvernement, plus surpris qu’effrayé d’apprendre le coup de panique qui venait d’emporter à Versailles, pendant la nuit, l’armée, les services publics, les ministres ; et, comme le temps était superbe, par ce beau dimanche de mars, Paris descendit tranquillement dans les rues regarder les barricades. Une grande affiche blanche du Comité central, convoquant le peuple pour des élections communales, semblait très sage. On s’étonnait simplement de la voir signée par des noms profondément inconnus. À cette aube de la Commune, Paris était contre Versailles, dans la rancune de ce qu’il avait souffert et dans les soupçons qui le hantaient. C’était, d’ailleurs, l’anarchie absolue, la lutte des maires et du Comité central, les inutiles efforts de conciliation tentés par les premiers, tandis que l’autre, peu sûr encore d’avoir pour lui toute la garde nationale fédérée, continuait à ne revendiquer modestement que les libertés municipales. Les coups de feu tirés contre la manifestation pacifique de la place Vendôme, les quelques victimes dont le sang avait rougi le pavé, jetèrent, au travers de la ville, le premier frisson de terreur. Et, pendant que l’insurrection triomphante s’emparait définitivement de tous les ministères et de toutes les administrations publiques, la colère et la peur étaient grandes à Versailles, le gouvernement se pressait de réunir des forces militaires suffisantes, pour repousser une attaque qu’il sentait prochaine. Les meilleures troupes des armées du Nord et de la Loire étaient appelées en hâte, une dizaine de jours avaient suffi pour réunir près de quatre-vingt mille hommes, et la confiance revenait si rapide, que, dès le 2 avril, deux divisions, ouvrant les hostilités, enlevèrent aux fédérés Puteaux et Courbevoie.","In the following days, Maurice forgot at first, amid the rushing extraordinary events. On the 19th, Paris had woken up without a government, more surprised than frightened to learn of the stroke of panic which had just carried off at Versailles, during the night, the army, the public services, the ministers; and, as the weather was superb, on this beautiful Sunday in March, Paris quietly descended into the streets to watch the barricades. A large white poster of the Central Committee, summoning the people for communal elections, seemed very wise. We were simply surprised to see it signed by deeply unknown names. At the dawn of the Commune, Paris was against Versailles, resentful of what it had suffered and the suspicions that haunted it. It was, moreover, absolute anarchy, the struggle between the mayors and the Central Committee, the useless efforts at conciliation attempted by the former, while the latter, still unsure of having the whole National Guard on his side. federated, continued to modestly claim only municipal liberties. The shots fired against the peaceful demonstration in the Place Vendôme, the few victims whose blood had reddened the pavement, sent the first shudder of terror through the town. And, while the triumphant insurrection definitively seized all the ministries and all the public administrations, anger and fear were great at Versailles, the government was in a hurry to assemble sufficient military forces to repel an attack that he felt next. The best troops of the armies of the North and the Loire were called up in haste, ten days had sufficed to bring together nearly eighty thousand men, and confidence returned so quickly that, from April 2, two divisions, opening the hostilities took Puteaux and Courbevoie from the Federals.","During the days which followed it was at first crowded out of Maurice’s mind because of the extraordinary events happening one after another. On the 19th Paris had woken up without a government, more surprised than frightened to hear about the sudden panic that during the night had swept away the army, public services and government ministers to Versailles, and as the weather was superb on this lovely March Sunday, Paris calmly came down into the streets to have a look at the barricades. A big white poster put up by the Central Committee summoning people for communal elections sounded very sensible, though it was a little surprising that it was signed by such utterly unknown names. In this first fine flush of the Commune Paris was hostile to Versailles because of the resentment it felt for what it had suffered and its haunting suspicions. In any case there was absolute anarchy, a struggle between the local mayors and the Central Committee, the former making fruitless efforts at conciliation while the latter, still unsure of having all the federal National Guards on its side, was still modestly campaigning only for municipal liberty. The shots fired against the peaceful demonstration in the Place Vendôme and the handful of victims whose blood stained the roadway sent the first shudder of horror through the city. While the insurrection was triumphantly and definitely taking over all the ministries and public administration, anger and fear were mounting at Versailles and the government was hastening to assemble sufficient military strength to repulse an attack it felt must be imminent. The best troops from the armies of the north and the Loire were hurriedly brought in and ten days sufficed for concentrating nearly eighty thousand men. Confidence was so rapidly restored that by 2 April two divisions opened hostilities and recaptured Puteaux and Courbevoie from the Federals.","The extraordinary occurrences of the next and the succeeding days crowded on the heels of one another in such swift sequence that Maurice had scarcely time to think. On the morning of the 19th Paris awoke without a government, more surprised than frightened to learn that a panic during the night had sent army, ministers, and all the public service scurrying away to Versailles, and as the weather happened to be fine on that magnificent March Sunday, Paris stepped unconcernedly down into the streets to have a look at the barricades. A great white poster, bearing the signature of the Central Committee and convoking the people for the communal elections, attracted attention by the moderation of its language, although much surprise was expressed at seeing it signed by names so utterly unknown. There can be no doubt that at this incipient stage of the Commune Paris, in the bitter memory of what it had endured, in the suspicions by which it was haunted, and in its unslaked thirst for further fighting, was against Versailles. It was a condition of absolute anarchy, moreover, the conflict for the moment being between the mayors and the Central Committee, the former fruitlessly attempting to introduce measures of conciliation, while the latter, uncertain as yet to what extent it could rely on the federated National Guard, continued modestly to lay claim to no higher title than that of defender of the municipal liberties. The shots fired against the pacific demonstration in the Place Vendome, the few corpses whose blood reddened the pavements, first sent a thrill of terror circulating through the city. And while these things were going on, while the insurgents were taking definite possession of the ministries and all the public buildings, the agitation, rage and alarm prevailing at Versailles were extreme, the government there hastening to get together sufficient troops to repel the attack which they felt sure they should not have to wait for long. The steadiest and most reliable divisions of the armies of the North and of the Loire were hurried forward. Ten days sufficed to collect a force of nearly eighty thousand men, and the tide of returning confidence set in so strongly that on the 2d of April two divisions opened hostilities by taking from the federates Puteaux and Courbevoie."

"Et, d’une poche profonde de sa capote, il tira une bouteille d’eau-de-vie, en ajoutant, de son air triomphal, que c’était un cadeau d’une dame. La veille, en effet, on l’avait vu, attablé au fond d’un cabaret de Floing, très entreprenant à l’égard de la servante, qu’il tenait sur ses genoux. Maintenant, les soldats riaient de bon cœur, tendaient leurs gamelles, dans lesquelles il versait lui-même, gaiement.","And, from a deep pocket of his greatcoat, he took out a bottle of brandy, adding, with his triumphant air, that it was a present from a lady. The day before, in fact, he had been seen seated at a table at the back of a tavern at Floing, very enterprising with regard to the servant whom he was holding on his knees. Now the soldiers were laughing heartily, holding out their bowls, into which he himself was pouring, merrily.","And from a pocket deep in his cape he produced a bottle of brandy, adding with his triumphant air that it was a present from a lady. And indeed he had been seen the evening before at a table in a pub at Floing getting very fresh with the barmaid whom he had on his knee. By now the soldiers were laughing like mad, holding out their messtins into which he was gaily pouring.","From the capacious pocket of his capote he extracted a bottle of brandy, adding, with his all-conquering air, that it was the gift of a lady. (He had been seen the day before, seated at the table of a tavern in Floing and holding the waitress on his lap, evidently on the best of terms with her.) The soldiers laughed and winked at one another, holding out their porringers, into which he gayly poured the golden liquor."
"Pendant ses longues veillées à l’ambulance de Remilly, elle était devenue très experte à soigner, à panser les blessures. Et elle voulut tout de suite examiner celles de son frère, qu’elle déshabilla, sans le tirer de son évanouissement. Mais, quand elle défit le pansement sommaire imaginé par Jean, il s’agita, il eut un faible cri, en ouvrant de grands yeux de fièvre. Tout de suite, d’ailleurs, il la reconnut, il sourit.","During her long vigils in the ambulance at Remilly, she had become very adept at caring for and dressing wounds. And she immediately wanted to examine those of her brother, whom she undressed without pulling him out of his fainting spell. But when she undid the hasty bandage imagined by Jean, he stirred, he gave a weak cry, opening his eyes wide with fever. Immediately, moreover, he recognized her, he smiled.","Her long watches at the hospital at Remilly had made her very skilful at nursing and dressing wounds. She insisted on examining her brother’s wound at once, and undressed him, but that did not revive him. Yet as she undid the emergency dressing Jean had improvised he did move, made a little noise, then opened wide, feverish eyes. He recognized her at once and smiled.","She had acquired considerable experience in surgery during the long time she had been in attendance on the hospital at Remilly, and now she proceeded without delay to examine her brother's hurt, who remained unconscious while she was undressing him. But when she undid the rude bandage of Jean's invention, he stirred feebly and uttered a faint cry of pain, opening wide his eyes that were bright with fever. He recognized her at once and smiled."
"Ils achevèrent la seconde bouteille. Prosper, étant revenu de l’écurie, donna un coup de main, pour charger, en travers de la brouette, à la place des deux moutons morts, les pains que Silvine avait mis dans un sac. Mais il ne répondit même pas, il tourna le dos, quand son frère et les deux autres s’en allèrent, disparurent avec la brouette, dans la neige, en répétant :","They finished the second bottle. Prosper, having returned from the stable, helped to load across the wheelbarrow, in place of the two dead sheep, the loaves that Silvine had put in a bag.

"Et le piétinement continuait, les Prussiens hâtaient encore la marche avec leur brutalité de vainqueurs, le troupeau sortit de Sedan par la porte du Ménil, allongé en une file étroite qui galopait, comme dans la peur des chiens.","And the trampling continued, the Prussians still hastening the march with their victorious brutality, the herd left Sedan by the Ménil gate, stretched out in a narrow file which galloped, as if in fear of the dogs.","The tramp went on, with the Prussians hurrying them up with the arrogance of conquerors, and the herd left Sedan by the Ménil gate, in a thin line, scampering along as though it was being worried by the hounds.","And the trailing, shambling line crept slowly onward, the Prussians urging on the weary men with the brutality of conquerors; the column left the city by the Minil gate in straggling, long-drawn array, hastening their steps, like sheep at whose heels the dogs are snapping."
"Jean évita la barricade qui fermait la rue Royale, entre le ministère de la Marine et le Garde-Meuble, sauvés du feu. Il entendait, derrière les sacs et les tonneaux de terre dont elle était faite, de grosses voix de soldats. En avant, un fossé la défendait, plein d’eau croupie, où nageait un cadavre de fédéré ; et, par une brèche, on apercevait les maisons du carrefour Saint-Honoré, qui achevaient de brûler, malgré les pompes venues de la banlieue, dont on distinguait le ronflement. À droite et à gauche, les petits arbres, les kiosques des marchandes de journaux, étaient brisés, criblés de mitraille. De grands cris s’élevaient, les pompiers venaient de découvrir, dans une cave, sept locataires d’une des maisons, à moitié carbonisés.","Jean avoided the barricade which closed the Rue Royale, between the Ministry of Marine and the Garde-Meuble, which had been saved from the fire. He heard, behind the sacks and the barrels of earth of which it was made, the loud voices of soldiers. In front, a ditch defended it, full of stagnant water, in which swam the corpse of a Confederate; and, through a breach, one could see the houses of the Saint-Honoré crossroads, which had just finished burning, in spite of the pumps coming from the suburbs, whose roar could be heard. Right and left, the little trees, the kiosks of the newsagents, were broken, riddled with grapeshot. Loud cries arose, the firefighters had just discovered, in a cellar, seven tenants of one of the houses, half charred.","Jean avoided the barricade across the rue Royale, between the Ministry of Marine and the Garde-Meuble, which had escaped the fire. He could hear loud voices of soldiers behind the sandbags and barrels of earth. In front of it there was a ditch full of stagnant water with the corpse of a Federal floating in it, and through a breach could be seen buildings at the crossing with the rue Saint-Honoré still burning in spite of pumps brought in from the suburbs that could be heard throbbing. On either side the little trees and news kiosks were broken and riddled with shot. There was a lot of shouting, the firemen had discovered in a cellar the half-charred remains of seven tenants of one of the buildings.","Jean gave a wide berth to the barricade erected across the Rue Royale between the Ministry of Marine and the Garde-Meuble, both of which the fire had spared; he could hear the voices of the soldiers behind the sand bags and casks of earth with which it was constructed. Its front was protected by a ditch, filled with stagnant, greenish water, in which was floating the dead body of a federate, and through one of its embrasures they caught a glimpse of the houses in the carrefour Saint-Honore, which were burning still in spite of the engines that had come in from the suburbs, of which they heard the roar and clatter. To right and left the trees and the kiosks of the newspaper venders were riddled by the storm of bullets to which they had been subjected. Loud cries of horror arose; the firemen, in exploring the cellar of one of the burning houses, had come across the charred bodies of seven of its inmates."

"Trois autres cadavres de soldats prussiens s’allongeaient sur la terrasse. Comme Henriette, cette fois, les regardait fixement, sans doute avec la pensée de son mari, qui lui aussi dormait là-bas, défiguré dans le sang et la poussière, une balle, près de sa tête, frappa un arbre qui se trouvait derrière elle. Jean s’était précipité.","Three other corpses of Prussian soldiers were lying on the terrace. As Henriette this time was staring at them, no doubt with the thought of her husband, who was also sleeping there, disfigured in blood and dust, a bullet, close to her head, struck a tree which was behind she.

"Henriette eut un soupir de profond soulagement. Enfin, on marchait donc ! Elle les suivit, espérant arriver avec eux, prête à courir, s’ils couraient. Mais, de nouveau déjà, on s’était arrêté. À présent, les projectiles pleuvaient, il allait falloir, pour réoccuper Bazeilles, reconquérir chaque mètre de la route, s’emparer des ruelles, des maisons, des jardins, à droite et à gauche. Les premiers rangs avaient ouvert le feu, on n’avançait plus que par saccades, les moindres obstacles faisaient perdre de longues minutes. Jamais elle n’arriverait, si elle restait ainsi en queue, attendant la victoire. Et elle se décida, se jeta à droite, entre deux haies, dans un sentier qui descendait vers les prairies.","Henriette sighed in deep relief. Finally, we were walking! She followed them, hoping to come with them, ready to run, if they ran. But, once again, we had stopped. Now the projectiles were raining down, it was going to be necessary, to reoccupy Bazeilles, to reconquer every meter of the road, to seize the alleys, the houses, the gardens, on the right and on the left. The first ranks had opened fire, we only advanced jerkily, the slightest obstacles made us lose long minutes. She would never arrive if she stayed in line waiting for victory. And she made up her mind, threw herself to the right, between two hedges, onto a path leading down to the meadows.","Henriette heaved an immense sigh of relief. At last they were marching! She followed on in the hope of getting there with them, and was prepared to run if they ran. But already once again they came to a halt. By now projectiles were raining down, and to occupy Bazeilles would mean reconquering every metre of the way and seizing alleyways, houses, gardens to right and left. The front ranks had opened fire and now they were only advancing in fits and starts, and the smallest obstacles caused many minutes’ delay. She would never get there if she stayed like this at their tail waiting for victory. So she made up her mind and threw herself to the right along a path between two hedges that went down towards the meadows.","Henriette gave a deep sigh of relief; at last they were about to move! She followed them, with the hope that she might enter the village unperceived in their rear, prepared to run with them should they take the double-quick. But they had scarcely begun to move when they came to a halt again. The projectiles were now falling thick and fast; to regain possession of Bazeilles it would be necessary to dispute every inch of the road, occupying the cross-streets, the houses and gardens on either side of the way. A brisk fire of musketry proceeded from the head of the column, the advance was irregular, by fits and starts, every petty obstacle entailed a delay of many minutes. She felt that she would never attain her end by remaining there at the rear of the column, waiting for it to fight its way through, and with prompt decision she bent her course to the right and took a path that led downward between two hedges to the meadows."

"Du fond de sa chambre écartée, il avait fini par se rendre ainsi compte de la vie intérieure de la ferme, dont les moindres rumeurs lui étaient devenues familières. L’oreille tendue, il reprit tout de suite :","From the depths of his secluded bedroom, he had come to realize the interior life of the farm, the slightest rumors of which had become familiar to him. Listening intently, he resumed immediately:","In his isolated room he had developed an awareness of the regular life of the farm, and was familiar with the slightest sounds.

"Il dut redire cet ordre en allemand. Et un soldat s’avança, un Bavarois trapu, à l’énorme tête embroussaillée de barbe et de cheveux roux, sous lesquels on ne distinguait qu’un large nez carré et que de gros yeux bleus.

He was stained with blood, dreadful, like one of those cave bears, one of those hairy beasts all red from the prey whose bones they had just cracked.","He had to repeat the order in German. A soldier stepped forward, a thickset Bavarian with a huge head bristling with red beard and hair, in the midst of which all that could be seen was a wide potato nose and big blue eyes. He had blood on him and looked horrible, like one of those cave-dwelling bears, hairy wild beasts red with the prey whose bones they have been cracking.","He had to repeat his order in German, whereon a soldier came forward from the ranks, a short stocky Bavarian, with an enormous head surrounded by a bristling forest of red hair and beard, beneath which all that was to be seen were a pair of big blue eyes and a massive nose.

"Et les yeux de Maurice se fermèrent, dans la fatigue de l’effort que lui avaient coûté ces quelques mots. D’un signe, Henriette avait prié Jean de ne pas discuter. Toute une protestation la soulevait elle-même, sa colère contre la souffrance humaine, malgré son calme de femme frêle et si brave, avec ses regards limpides où revivait l’âme héroïque du grand-père, le héros des légendes napoléoniennes.","And Maurice's eyes closed, in the fatigue of the effort which these few words had cost him. With a sign, Henriette had begged Jean not to argue.

Henriette signalled to Jean not to argue. In her anger against human suffering she herself felt a wave of protest taking possession of her, for all her brave, feminine quietness, and in her clear eyes shone the heroic soul of their grandfather, the hero of Napoleonic legend.","And Maurice closed his eyes, exhausted by the effort it had cost him to utter those few words. Henriette signaled Jean not to continue the discussion.

"Tout d’un coup, il y eut une furieuse bousculade, des piétinements, des glissements, au milieu de jurons étouffés et de râles. Sambuc et les deux autres s’étaient rués sur Goliath ; et, malgré leur nombre, ils n’arrivaient pas à maîtriser le colosse, dont le danger décuplait les forces. Dans les ténèbres, on entendait les craquements des membres, l’effort haletant des étreintes. Heureusement, le revolver était tombé. Une voix, celle de Cabasse, bégaya, étranglée : « Les cordes, les cordes ! » tandis que Ducat passait à Sambuc le paquet de cordes dont ils avaient eu la précaution de se pourvoir. Alors, ce fut une opération sauvage, faite à coups de pied, à coups de poing, les jambes attachées d’abord, puis les bras liés aux flancs, puis le corps tout entier ficelé à tâtons, au hasard des soubresauts, avec un tel luxe de tours et de nœuds, que l’homme était comme pris en un filet dont les mailles lui entraient dans la chair. Il continuait de crier, la voix de Ducat répétait : « Ferme donc ta gueule ! » Les cris cessèrent, Cabasse avait noué brutalement sur la bouche un vieux mouchoir bleu. Enfin, ils soufflèrent, ils l’emportèrent ainsi qu’un paquet dans la cuisine, où ils l’allongèrent sur la grande table, à côté de la chandelle.","Suddenly there was a furious jostling, stomping, sliding, amid muffled curses and gasps. Sambuc and the other two had rushed at Goliath; and, in spite of their number, they could not control the colossus, the danger of which multiplied his forces tenfold. In the darkness you could hear the creaking of limbs, the panting effort of embraces. Fortunately, the revolver had fallen. A voice, that of Cabasse, stammered, strangled: “The strings, the strings! while Ducat handed Sambuc the bundle of ropes they had taken the precaution to provide. So it was a savage operation, carried out with kicks, punches, the legs tied first, then the arms tied to the sides, then the whole body tied up gropingly, at random jolts, with such luxury of twists and knots, that the man was as if caught in a net whose meshes entered his flesh. He continued to shout, Ducat's voice repeating: ""Shut up!"" The cries ceased, Cabasse had tied an old blue handkerchief roughly over his mouth. Finally, they blew, they took it and a package into the kitchen, where they laid it on the big table, beside the candle.","Suddenly there was a furious scrimmage, with stampings and slippings, muffled oaths and snorts. Sambuc and the two others had fallen upon Goliath, and in spite of their number they could not immediately master the giant, whose strength was increased by danger. In the darkness there could be heard crackings of bones and the panting of men grappling. Fortunately the revolver had fallen on to the floor. A voice, Cabasse’s, gasped: ‘The ropes! The ropes!’ and Ducat passed to Sambuc the bundle of ropes they had taken the precaution of bringing with them. There followed a long, savage operation involving kicks and punches; the legs tied first, then the arms tied to the sides, then the whole body tied up by feel, depending on the man’s jerking struggles, with such a riot of turns and knots that the man was enveloped in a sort of net, some of the meshes of which cut into his flesh. He never stopped shouting and Ducat’s voice went on saying: ‘Shut your jaw!’ The cries stopped. Cabasse had roughly tied an old blue handkerchief over his mouth. Then they regained their breath and carried him like a bale into the kitchen, where they laid him out on the big table beside the candle.","All at once there was a furious rush, with the noise of trampling, shuffling feet, and smothered oaths and the sound of labored breathing. Sambuc and his two companions had thrown themselves on Goliah, and notwithstanding their superiority in numbers they found it no easy task to overpower the giant, to whom his peril lent tenfold strength. The panting of the combatants, the straining of sinews and cracking of joints, resounded for a moment in the obscurity. The revolver, fortunately, had fallen to the floor in the struggle. Cabasse's choking, inarticulate voice was heard exclaiming: “The cords, the cords!” and Ducat handed to Sambuc the coil of thin rope with which they had had the foresight to provide themselves. Scant ceremony was displayed in binding their hapless victim; the operation was conducted to the accompaniment of kicks and cuffs. The legs were secured first, then the arms were firmly pinioned to the sides, and finally they wound the cord at random many times around the Prussian's body, wherever his contortions would allow them to place it, with such an affluence of loops and knots that he had the appearance of being enmeshed in a gigantic net. To his unintermitting outcries Ducat's voice responded: “Shut your jaw!” and Cabasse silenced him more effectually by gagging him with an old blue handkerchief. Then, first waiting a moment to get their breath, they carried him, an inert mass, to the kitchen and deposited him upon the big table, beside the candle."

"En cas d’insuccès, aucune ligne de retraite n’avait été indiquée aux corps d’armée. Dans cette imprévoyance et cette confusion, chaque général était libre d’agir à sa guise, et tous, à cette heure, se trouvaient rejetés dans Sedan, sous la formidable étreinte des armées allemandes victorieuses. La deuxième division du 7e corps se repliait en assez bon ordre, tandis que les débris de ses autres divisions, mêlés à ceux du 1er corps, roulaient déjà vers la ville en une affreuse cohue, un torrent de colère et d’épouvante, charriant les hommes et les bêtes.","In case of failure, no line of retreat had been indicated to the army corps.

The second division of the 7th corps fell back in comparatively good order, while the remnants of the other divisions, mingled with the debris of the 1st corps, were already streaming into the city in terrible disorder, a roaring torrent of rage and fright that bore all, men and beasts, before it."
"Le père Fouchard, toujours sur la route, s’était approché, debout devant la fenêtre, pour écouter ; et le récit de ce pillage le rendait soucieux : on lui avait dit que les Prussiens payaient tout, est-ce qu’ils allaient se mettre à être des voleurs, maintenant ? Maurice et Jean, eux aussi, se passionnaient, à ces détails sur un ennemi que cette fille venait de voir, et qu’eux n’avaient pu rencontrer, depuis un mois qu’on se battait ; tandis que, pensif, la bouche souffrante, Honoré ne s’intéressait qu’à elle, ne songeait qu’au malheur ancien qui les avait séparés.","Father Fouchard, still on the road, had approached, standing before the window, to listen; and the story of this pillage made him worry: he had been told that the Prussians paid for everything, were they going to start being thieves now? Maurice and Jean, too, were passionate about these details about an enemy that this girl had just seen, and whom they had not been able to meet, for a month that we had been fighting; while, thoughtful, his mouth aching, Honoré was interested only in her, thought only of the old misfortune which had separated them.","Old Fouchard, who had stayed out in the road, had come and stood by the window to listen, and this tale gave him food for thought; he had been told that the Prussians paid for everything, were they going to start thieving now? Maurice and Jean were also listening intently to all these details about the enemy that this girl had just seen, and whom they had never succeeded in setting eyes on in a whole month of war. But Honoré, lost in thought and betraying his emotions by the expression of his mouth, was only interested in her, and thinking of nothing but the old trouble that had separated them.","Father Fouchard had crossed the road and stationed himself at the open window where he could hear, and the tale of pillage made him uneasy; he had been told that the Prussians paid for all they took; were they going to start out as robbers at that late day? Maurice and Jean, too, were deeply interested in those details about an enemy whom the girl had seen, and whom they had not succeeded in setting eyes on in their whole month's campaigning, while Honore, pensive and with dry, parched lips, was conscious only of the sound of her voice; he could think of nothing save her and the misfortune that had parted them."

"– Tonnerre de bon Dieu ! jura l’homme, les yeux pleins de grosses larmes, qu’est-ce que nous allons devenir ?","- Thunder of good God! swore the man, his eyes full of big tears, what will become of us?","‘God Almighty!’ swore the man, with big tears in his eyes. ‘What’s going to become of us?’","“My God! my God!” the man exclaimed, his eyes swimming with tears, “what is to become of us?”"

"D’un bond, il s’était jeté dans le champ voisin, lorsque Chouteau l’imita, galopant à son côté. Tout de suite, deux Prussiens de l’escorte se mirent à leur poursuite, sans qu’aucun autre songeât à les arrêter d’une balle. Et la scène fut si brève, qu’on ne put d’abord s’en rendre compte. Loubet, faisant des crochets parmi les broussailles, allait s’échapper sûrement, tandis que Chouteau, moins agile, était déjà sur le point d’être pris. Mais, d’un suprême effort, celui-ci regagna du terrain, se jeta entre les jambes du camarade, qu’il culbuta ; et, pendant que les deux Prussiens se précipitaient sur l’homme à terre, pour le maintenir, l’autre sauta dans le bois, disparut. Quelques coups de feu partirent, on se souvenait des fusils. Il y eut même, parmi les arbres, une tentative de battue, inutile.","With a bound he had thrown himself into the neighboring field, when Chouteau imitated him, galloping at his side. Immediately, two Prussians from the escort set off in pursuit, without anyone else thinking of stopping them with a bullet. And the scene was so brief that one could not at first realize it. Loubet, darting through the brushwood, was sure to escape, while Chouteau, less agile, was already on the point of being caught. But, with a supreme effort, the latter regained ground, threw himself between the legs of the comrade, whom he knocked over; and, while the two Prussians rushed on the man on the ground, to hold him down, the other jumped into the wood and disappeared. A few shots went off, we remembered the guns. There was even, among the trees, an attempt to beat, useless.","He leaped with one bound into the field and Chouteau imitated him, running at his side. Two of the escorting Prussians at once gave chase, but neither thought of stopping them with a bullet. The scene was so brief that they hardly took it in. Loubet, zigzagging through the gorse, was certainly going to get away, but Chouteau, who was not so agile, was already on the point of being recaptured when, with a supreme effort, he dived between his companion’s legs and brought him down; and while the two Prussians rushed to hold that man on the ground Chouteau darted into the wood and disappeared. A few shots went off when they remembered their rifles. There was even a half-hearted beat through the trees, though to no purpose.","He broke through the line of the escort, and with a single bound was in the field, Chouteau following his example and running at his side. Two of the Prussian soldiers immediately started in pursuit, but the others seemed dazed, and it did not occur to them to send a ball after the fugitives. The entire episode was so soon over that it was not easy to note its different phases. Loubet dodged and doubled among the bushes and it appeared as if he would certainly succeed in getting off, while Chouteau, less nimble, was on the point of being captured, but the latter, summoning up all his energies in a supreme burst of speed, caught up with his comrade and dexterously tripped him; and while the two Prussians were lumbering up to secure the fallen man, the other darted into the wood and vanished. The guard, finally remembering that they had muskets, fired a few ineffectual shots, and there was some attempt made to search the thicket, which resulted in nothing."
"Déjà, Loubet allumait un brasier. Pache et Lapoulle plumaient l’oie, violemment. Chouteau, qui était allé chercher en courant un bout de ficelle chez les artilleurs, revint la pendre entre deux baïonnettes, devant le grand feu ; et Maurice fut chargé de la faire tourner de temps à autre, d’une pichenette. En dessous, la graisse tombait dans la gamelle de l’escouade. Ce fut le triomphe du rôtissage à la ficelle. Tout le régiment, attiré par la bonne odeur, vint faire le cercle. Et quel festin ! De l’oie rôtie, des pommes de terre bouillies, du pain, du fromage ! Lorsque Jean eut découpé l’oie, l’escouade s’en mit jusqu’aux yeux. Il n’y avait plus de portions, chacun s’en fourrait tant qu’il pouvait en contenir. Même, on en porta un morceau à l’artillerie qui avait donné la ficelle.","Already Loubet was lighting a brazier. Pache and Lapoulle plucked the goose violently. Chouteau, who had run to fetch a piece of string from the artillerymen, came back to hang it between two bayonets, in front of the big fire; and Maurice was instructed to turn it around from time to time, with a flick. Below, the grease fell into the squad's mess tin. It was the triumph of string roasting. The whole regiment, attracted by the good smell, came to circle. And what a feast! Roasted goose, boiled potatoes, bread, cheese! When Jean had cut up the goose, the squad got up to their eyes. There were no more portions, everyone stuffed themselves as much as they could contain. We even carried a piece of it to the artillery which had given the string.","Loubet was already blowing up the fire. Pache and Lapoulle were plucking the goose for all they were worth. Chouteau, who had run off to get some string from the artillerymen, came back and hung it between two bayonets in front of the roaring fire, and Maurice was detailed to turn it every now and again with a touch of his finger. The fat dripped down into the communal messtin. It was a triumph of string roasting. The whole regiment, attracted by the lovely smell, came and stood round, and what a feast! Roast goose, boiled potatoes, bread and cheese! When Jean had carved the goose the squad tucked into it up to their eyes. There was no question of portions, each man stuffed as much into him as he could take. They even took a piece over to the artillery who had provided the string.","Loubet had already kindled the fire into a roaring blaze; Pache and Lapoulle set to work to pluck the goose; Chouteau, who had run off to the artillerymen and begged a bit of twine, came back and stretched it between two bayonets; the bird was suspended in front of the hot fire and Maurice was given a cleaning rod and enjoined to keep it turning. The big tin basin was set beneath to catch the gravy. It was a triumph of culinary art; the whole regiment, attracted by the savory odor, came and formed a circle about the fire and licked their chops. And what a feast it was! roast goose, boiled potatoes, bread, cheese, and coffee! When Jean had dissected the bird the squad applied itself vigorously to the task before it; there was no talk of portions, every man ate as much as he was capable of holding. They even sent a plate full over to the artillerymen who had furnished the cord."
"Elle le regardait fixement, elle insista.","She stared at him, she insisted.",She looked hard at him and insisted.,"She continued to press him with her questions, looking at him steadily."
"Et il avait laissé tomber les pièces d’or dans le képi que Jean lui tendait. Celui-ci, remué par le chiffre de la somme, près de six cents francs, voulut tout de suite que Maurice en prît la moitié. On ne savait pas, ils pouvaient être brusquement séparés l’un de l’autre.","And he had dropped the gold coins into the kepi which Jean held out to him. The latter, moved by the amount of the sum, nearly six hundred francs, immediately wanted Maurice to take half of it. We did not know, they could be suddenly separated from each other.","He had dropped the coins into the képi Jean was holding out. Jean, staggered by the amount – nearly six hundred francs – wanted Maurice to have half at once. You never knew, they might get separated.","And he dropped the gold coins into the kepi that Jean held out to him. The latter, oppressed by the magnitude of the amount, nearly six hundred francs, insisted that Maurice should take one-half. No one could say what might happen; they might be parted from each other."
"– C’est ça, Goliath !… Ah ! le brigand, il connaît les bois de Dieulet comme ma poche, il est capable de nous faire pincer, un de ces matins ; d’autant plus qu’il s’est vanté, aujourd’hui, à la Croix de Malte, de nous régler notre compte avant huit jours… Un sale bougre qui a pour sûr conduit les Bavarois, la veille de Beaumont, n’est-ce pas ? vous autres !","""That's it, Goliath! Ah! the brigand, he knows the woods of Dieulet like the back of my hand, he is capable of getting us nabbed one of these mornings; all the more so since he boasted today, at the Maltese Cross, of settling our account within a week... it not? you others !","‘That’s it, Goliath! Ah, the bastard, he knows the Dieulet woods like the back of his hand, and he can get us pinched one of these mornings, especially as he boasted at the Croix de Malte today that he’d settle our account within a week… A dirty sod who for certain must have guided the Bavarians the day before Beaumont, don’t you think so, you chaps?’","“That's his name, Goliah! Ah, the brigand! he is as familiar with every inch of the wood of Dieulet as I am with my pocket, and he's like enough to get us pinched some fine morning. I heard of him to-day at the Maltese Cross making his boast that he would settle our business for us before we're a week older. A dirty hound, he is, and he served as guide to the Prussians the day before the battle of Beaumont; I leave it to these fellows if he didn't.” “It's as true as there's a candle standing on that table!”"
"– Mais non… C’est que j’ai peur, toute seule dans ce vestibule… J’aime bien mieux être dehors.","– But no… It’s just that I’m scared, all alone in this vestibule… I much prefer being outside.","‘No, of course not… But it makes me frightened, being alone in that hall… I’d rather be outside.’","“Why, no— but I am afraid to remain in that house, all alone. I would rather be outside.”"
"Foudroyé, dégrisé, Jean le regardait. Ils étaient seuls, les autres soldats s’étaient déjà mis à la poursuite des fuyards. Autour d’eux, les incendies flambaient plus haut, les fenêtres vomissaient de grandes flammes rouges, tandis qu’on entendait, à l’intérieur, l’écroulement embrasé des plafonds. Et Jean s’abattit près de Maurice, sanglotant, le tâtant, tâchant de le soulever, pour voir s’il ne pourrait pas le sauver encore.","Stunned, sobered, Jean looked at him. They were alone, the other soldiers had already set off in pursuit of the fugitives. Around them, the fires blazed higher, the windows spewed great red flames, while inside you could hear the fiery collapse of the ceilings. And Jean fell down beside Maurice, sobbing, feeling him, trying to lift him up, to see if he could still save him.","Jean looked at him, horrified and suddenly sobered. They were alone together, the other soldiers having already gone off in pursuit of the runaways. Round them the fires flared up still more fiercely, windows belched forth great red flames and from inside came the noise of blazing ceilings coming down. Jean collapsed beside Maurice, sobbing, feeling him and trying to lift him and see if he could yet save him.","Jean, sobered by the terrible shock, looked at him with wild eyes. They were alone; the other soldiers had gone in pursuit of the fugitives. About them the conflagrations roared and crackled and blazed up higher than before; great sheets of white flame poured from the windows, while from within came the crash of falling ceilings. And Jean cast himself on the ground at Maurice's side, sobbing, feeling him, trying to raise him to see if he might not yet be saved."
"– Ce que j’ai soif ! bégaya Maurice. Il me semble que j’ai de la suie dans la gorge. Tu ne sens pas cette odeur de roussi, de laine brûlée ?","""How thirsty I am!"" stammered Maurice. It seems to me that I have soot in my throat. Can't you smell that scorched smell, of burnt wool?","‘Oh, how thirsty I am!’ muttered Maurice. ‘I feel as if I had some soot down my throat. Can’t you smell scorching, like burning wool?’","“How thirsty I am!” Maurice murmured. “My throat is like an ash barrel. Don't you notice that smell of something scorching, a smell like burning woolen?”"
"Vivement, Maurice enfila son pantalon, pour descendre. Mais Combette parut, un bougeoir à la main, gesticulant.","Hurriedly, Maurice put on his trousers to get down. But Combette appeared, candlestick in hand, gesticulating.","Maurice quickly pulled on his trousers to go downstairs, but Combette appeared, holding a candlestick and gesticulating.","Maurice hastily slipped on his trousers preparatory to going down to the street, but just then Combette appeared at the door with a bed-candle in his hand, gesticulating wildly."
"Maurice, qui demeurait anéanti, eut un nouveau geste de désolation.","Maurice, who remained devastated, made another gesture of desolation.","Maurice was still cast down, and he made a gesture of despair once again.","Maurice, who was still in “the blues,” spoke regretfully: “Ah, the Emperor!"
"Le lendemain, après le déjeuner, comme le père Fouchard se trouvait seul, il vit entrer Goliath en personne, grand, gros, le visage rose, avec son tranquille sourire. S’il éprouva un saisissement, à cette brusque apparition, il n’en laissa rien paraître. Il clignait les paupières, tandis que l’autre s’avançait et lui serrait rondement la main.","The next day, after lunch, as Father Fouchard was alone, he saw Goliath enter in person, tall, fat, rosy-faced, with his calm smile. If he felt a shock at this sudden appearance, he did not show it. He blinked as the other came forward and shook his hand roundly.","The next day, while Fouchard was alone after lunch, he saw Goliath himself come in, tall, big and pink-faced as ever, with his imperturbable smile. If this sudden appearance gave him a shock he didn’t show anything but just blinked, as the man came over and vigorously shook his hand.","They had breakfasted the following morning, and Father Fouchard was alone in the kitchen when the door was thrown open and Goliah in the flesh entered the room, big and burly, with the ruddy hue of health on his face and his tranquil smile. If the old man experienced anything in the nature of a shock at the suddenness of the apparition he let no evidence of it escape him. He peered at the other through his half-closed lids while he came forward and shook his former employer warmly by the hand."
"Et il repoussait impitoyablement la porte sur Jean, il fallut que Maurice le suppliât. Mais il s’entêtait : non, non ! il n’avait pas besoin d’inconnus, de voleurs chez lui, qui casseraient ses meubles ! Enfin, Honoré, d’un coup d’épaule, fit entrer le camarade, et le vieux dut céder, grognant de sourdes menaces. Il n’avait pas lâché son fusil. Puis, quand il les eut conduits à la salle commune, et qu’il eut posé le fusil contre le buffet, la chandelle sur la table, il tomba dans un obstiné silence.","And he pushed back the door pitilessly on Jean, Maurice had to beg him. But he was stubborn: no, no! he didn't need strangers, thieves in his house, who would break his furniture! Finally, Honoré, with a push of the shoulder, ushered in the comrade, and the old man had to give in, grumbling in deaf threats. He hadn't dropped his gun. Then, when he had led them to the common room, and had placed the rifle against the sideboard, the candle on the table, he fell into an obstinate silence.","And he was by way of shutting the door pitilessly on Jean, and Maurice had to entreat him. But he was immovable: no, no, he didn’t want any strangers and thieves in his house and breaking up his furniture. Finally Honoré butted with his shoulder and let their mate in, and the old man had to give way, muttering vague threats. He had hung on to his gun. When he had taken them into the living-room and stood his rifle against the sideboard and put the candle on the table, he fell into a sullen silence.","He shut the door flat in Jean's face, in spite of Maurice's entreaties. But he was obdurate. No, no! he wouldn't have it; he had no use for strangers and robbers in his house, to smash and destroy his furniture! Finally Honore shoved their comrade inside the door by main strength and the old man had to make the best of it, grumbling and growling vindictively. He had carried his gun with him all this time. When at last he had ushered the three men into the common sitting-room and had stood his gun in a corner and placed the candle on the table, he sank into a mulish silence."
"– Il est jugé, il est condamné, le brigand !… Si vous savez un jour par où il doit passer, prévenez-moi donc, et sa tête ira rejoindre celle des uhlans dans la Meuse, ah ! tonnerre de Dieu, oui, je vous en réponds !","- He is judged, he is condemned, the brigand!... If you know one day where he must pass, let me know, and his head will join that of the uhlans in the Meuse, ah! thunder of God, yes, I answer you!","‘That swine is judged and condemned! If some day you get to know which way he’s going, let me know, and his head will join those of the Uhlans in the Meuse. By God, yes, you can take it from me!’","“He has been tried and adjudged guilty, the scoundrel! If ever you hear of his being in the neighborhood just send me word, and his head shall go and keep company with the heads of the two uhlans in the Meuse; yes, by G-d! I pledge you my word it shall.”"
"Mais le général, depuis Vouziers, ne croyait plus à la concentration des deux armées allemandes, dont on lui avait, disait-il, rebattu les oreilles. Et il ne jugea même pas à propos de faire conduire les francs-tireurs au chef du 7e corps, à qui du reste ceux-ci croyaient avoir parlé en sa personne. Si l’on avait écouté tous les paysans, tous les rôdeurs, qui apportaient de prétendus renseignements, on n’aurait plus fait un pas, sans être jeté à droite ou à gauche, dans des aventures impossibles. Cependant, il ordonna aux trois hommes de rester et d’accompagner la colonne, puisqu’ils connaissaient le pays.","But the general, since Vouziers, no longer believed in the concentration of the two German armies, which, he said, had been kept on his ears. And he did not even think fit to have the francs-tireurs taken to the chief of the 7th corps, to whom, moreover, they believed they had spoken in his person. If we had listened to all the peasants, all the prowlers, who brought so-called information, we would not have taken a step without being thrown to the right or to the left, in impossible adventures. However, he ordered the three men to stay and accompany the column, since they knew the country.","But since Vouziers the general had given up believing in this concentration of the two German armies which everybody, he said, had been dinning into his ears. He did not even think it worth while having the men taken to the commander of the 7th corps – to whom, actually, they thought they had been talking. If one had paid attention to all the yokels and tramps who brought so-called information, one wouldn’t have advanced a single step without being shunted right and left into absurd adventures. However, he did order the three men to stay and travel with the column because of their local knowledge.","Since leaving Vouziers the general had stoutly refused to attach any further credit to reports of the junction of the two German armies which, as he said, they had been trying to stuff down his throat. He did not even consider it worth his while to send the francs-tireurs before his corps commander, to whom the partisans supposed, all along, that they were talking; if they should attempt to listen to all the yarns that were brought them by tramps and peasants, they would have their hands full and be driven from pillar to post without ever advancing a step. He directed the three men to remain with the column, however, since they were acquainted with the country."
– Eh bien ! quoi donc ? quoi donc ?,- Well ! what ? what ?,"‘Well, what’s up? What’s up?’","“Well, what's the matter? what's the matter?”"
"Puis, tout d’un coup, il aperçut son uniforme souillé et déchiré, ses mains noires, et il parut souffrir de son état, devant des femmes. Une honte lui vint de s’abandonner ainsi, la pensée qu’il manquait de correction acheva de lui rendre toute une bravoure. Il réussit à reprendre d’une voix gaie :","Then, suddenly, he saw his soiled and torn uniform, his black hands, and he seemed to suffer from his condition, in front of women. A shame came to him at abandoning himself thus, the thought that he lacked discipline completed his bravery. He managed to resume in a cheerful voice:","Then he caught sight of his dirty, torn uniform and black hands and seemed to be embarrassed about being in such a state in front of women. He felt ashamed of letting himself go like this, and the thought that he was lacking in good manners finally gave him back quite a jaunty air. He managed to go on in a joking tone:","Then suddenly he became conscious of his torn, soiled uniform and the grime upon his hands, and it made him feel uncomfortable to be in the company of women in such a state. It shamed him to show such weakness, and his desire to look and be the gentleman to the last restored to him his manhood. When he spoke again it was in a tone almost of cheerfulness."
"Mais, depuis un instant, Loubet avait avisé, à deux ou trois cents mètres, une petite ferme, une des dernières habitations de Contreuve, où il lui avait semblé distinguer tout un gros commerce. Il appela Chouteau et Lapoulle, en disant :","But, a moment ago, Loubet had spotted a small farm two or three hundred meters away, one of the last dwellings in Contreuve, where he thought he could make out a large business. He called Chouteau and Lapoulle, saying:","But a minute or so earlier Loubet had spotted a little farm two or three hundred metres away, one of the last habitations of Contreuve, where he thought he could make out quite a bit of trade going on. He got hold of Lapoulle and said:","But Loubet's attention had just been attracted to a little farmhouse, one of the last dwellings in Contreuve, some two or three hundred yards away, where there seemed to him to be promise of good results. He called Chouteau and Lapoulle to him and said:"
"– Rappelle-toi donc ce que tu m’as dit, le lendemain de Sedan, quand tu prétendais que ce n’était pas mauvais, parfois, de recevoir une bonne gifle… Et tu ajoutais que, lorsqu’on avait de la pourriture quelque part, un membre gâté, ça valait mieux de le voir par terre, abattu d’un coup de hache, que d’en crever comme d’un choléra… J’ai songé souvent à cette parole, depuis que je me suis trouvé seul, enfermé dans ce Paris de démence et de misère… Eh bien ! c’est moi qui suis le membre gâté que tu as abattu…","“Remember what you said to me, the day after Sedan, when you claimed that it was not bad, sometimes, to receive a good slap… And you added that, when there was something rotten part, a spoiled member, it was better to see it on the ground, cut down with an ax, than to die of it like cholera... I have often thought of this word, since I found myself alone , locked up in this Paris of madness and misery… Well! it is I who am the spoiled limb that you slaughtered…","‘Remember what you said the day after Sedan when you maintained that it did no harm sometimes to get a good bashing. And you said, too, that if something had gone rotten somewhere, like a poisoned limb, it was better to see it hacked off and lying on the ground than to die of it like the cholera … I’ve often thought about that since I’ve been on my own and shut up in this crazy, starving Paris… Well, I’m the rotten limb you have lopped off…’","“Remember what you said to me the day after Sedan, that it was not such a bad thing, now and then, to receive a good drubbing. And you added that if a man had gangrene in his system, if he saw one of his limbs wasting from mortification, it would be better to take an ax and chop off that limb than to die from the contamination of the poison. I have many a time thought of those words since I have been here, without a friend, immured in this city of distress and madness. And I am the diseased limb, and it is you who have lopped it off—”"
"– Caporal, demanda Pache, d’une voix un peu tremblante, vous qui avez de l’idée, si vous pouviez le tuer sans lui faire du mal ?","""Corporal,"" asked Pache, in a slightly shaky voice, ""you who have any idea, if you could kill him without hurting him?""","‘Corporal,’ ventured Pache in a slightly quavery voice, ‘you know all about these things, could you kill him without hurting him?’","“Corporal,” asked Pache, in a voice that faltered a little, “you have lots of ideas in your head; couldn't you kill him painlessly?”"

"Il s’élança, revint d’un bond, avec le chassepot et les cartouches du soldat mort. Pour les grandes occasions, lorsqu’il voulait voir très clair, il avait toujours sur lui une paire de lunettes, qu’il ne portait pas d’habitude, par une gêne coquette et touchante, à l’égard de sa jeune femme. D’une main prompte, il arracha le binocle, le remplaça par les lunettes ; et ce gros bourgeois en paletot, à la bonne face ronde que la colère transfigurait, presque comique et superbe d’héroïsme, se mit à faire le coup de feu, tirant dans le tas des Bavarois, au fond de la rue. Il avait ça dans le sang, disait-il, ça le démangeait d’en descendre quelques-uns, depuis les récits de 1814, dont on avait bercé son enfance, là-bas, en Alsace.","He rushed forward, came back with a bound, with the hunting-pot and the cartridges of the dead soldier. For special occasions, when he wanted to see very clearly, he always had a pair of glasses on him, which he did not usually wear, out of a flirtatious and touching embarrassment towards his young wife. With a quick hand, he tore off the glasses, replaced them with the glasses; and this fat bourgeois in an overcoat, with a good round face transfigured by anger, almost comical and superb in his heroism, began to fire, firing into the crowd of Bavarians at the end of the street. It was in his blood, he said, he was itching to shoot a few of them, since the stories of 1814, which had been nurtured in his childhood, over there, in Alsace.","He dashed off and came back in a single bound with the rifle and cartridges of the dead soldier. For special occasions, when he wanted to see clearly, he always had on him a pair of spectacles which he did not usually wear, out of a touching sense of embarrassment and vanity in front of his young wife. Now he quickly took off his folding glasses and replaced them with the spectacles, and this heavily-built bourgeois in his overcoat, with his round, jolly face transfigured by rage, looking almost comically and sublimely heroic, began firing into the mass of Bavarians at the end of the street. It was in his blood, as he always used to say, this urge to pick a few of them off, ever since the tales of 1814 he had been told in his childhood away in Alsace.","He darted away and came running back with the dead soldier's rifle and ammunition. He was accustomed to carry a pair of spectacles on his person for use on occasions of emergency, when he wished to see with great distinctness, but did not wear them habitually out of respect for the wishes of his young wife. He now impatiently tore off his double eyeglass and substituted the spectacles, and the big, burly bourgeois, his overcoat flapping about his legs, his honest, kindly, round face ablaze with wrath, who would have been ridiculous had he not been so superbly heroic, proceeded to open fire, peppering away at the Bavarians at the bottom of the street. It was in his blood, he said; he had been hankering for something of the kind ever since the days of his boyhood, down there in Alsace, when he had been told all those tales of 1814."

"Gilberte elle-même se montra très émue, très passionnée pour ce rôle nouveau d’infirmière. Elle prit à peine le temps de nouer sur ses cheveux une dentelle ; et les trois femmes descendirent. En bas, comme elles arrivaient sous le vaste porche, elles virent un rassemblement dans la rue, par la porte ouverte à deux battants. Une voiture basse arrivait lentement, une sorte de carriole, attelée d’un seul cheval, qu’un lieutenant de zouaves conduisait par la bride. Et elles crurent que c’était un premier blessé qu’on leur amenait.","Gilberte herself was very moved, very passionate about this new role of nurse. She barely took the time to tie a lace on her hair; and the three women went down. Downstairs, as they came under the wide porch, they saw a gathering in the street, through the open double door. A low carriage was slowly approaching, a sort of cart, harnessed to a single horse, led by the bridle of a lieutenant of the Zouaves. And they believed that it was the first wounded man brought to them.","Gilberte herself seemed very concerned and enthusiastic about this new role as a nurse. She just took the time to tie a lace scarf over her hair and the three women went down. As they reached the archway down below, through the open gate they saw some people gathered in the street. A low vehicle was slowly coming along, a sort of trap with one horse being led by a lieutenant in the Zouaves. They thought it was. the first wounded being brought in.","Gilberte also displayed much enthusiasm for her new occupation as nurse; she barely took the time to throw a lace scarf over her head, and the three women went downstairs. When they reached the bottom and stood in the spacious vestibule, looking out through the main entrance, of which the leaves had been thrown wide back, they beheld a crowd collected in the street before the house. A low-hung carriage was advancing slowly along the roadway, a sort of carriole, drawn by a single horse, which a lieutenant of zouaves was leading by the bridle. They took it to be a wounded man that they were bringing to them, the first of their patients."
"Un nouvel accès de larmes l’avait abattu sur l’oreiller. C’était une détente nerveuse irrésistible, qui emportait tout, une de ces chutes soudaines dans le désespoir, le mépris du monde entier et de lui-même, auxquelles il était si fréquemment sujet. Sa sœur, le connaissant bien, demeurait placide.","Another burst of tears had brought him down on the pillow. It was an irresistible nervous release, which carried away everything, one of those sudden falls into despair, contempt for the whole world and for himself, to which he was so frequently subject. His sister, knowing him well, remained placid.","He fell back on to the pillow in another flood of tears. It was an irresistible nervous reaction, an all-destroying collapse, one of those sudden plunges into despair and contempt for the world and for himself to which he was so often subject. Knowing him well, his sister remained calm.","He sank upon the pillow in a renewed outpour of tears. It was an utter breakdown of the nervous system, sweeping everything before it, one of those sudden lapses into hopelessness to which he was so subject, in which he despised himself and all the world. His sister, knowing as she did the best way of treating such crises, kept an unruffled face."
"Puis, voyant sa mère éclater en larmes, il se mit à pleurer lui aussi, pendu à son cou. Mon Dieu ! de quel malheur nouveau était-elle donc menacée ? N’était-ce point assez d’avoir perdu, avec Honoré, le seul espoir de sa vie, la certitude d’oublier et d’être heureuse encore ? Il fallait que l’autre homme ressuscitât, pour achever son malheur.","Then, seeing his mother burst into tears, he began to cry too, clinging to her neck. My God ! what new misfortune was she threatened with? Was it not enough to have lost, with Honoré, the only hope of her life, the certainty of forgetting and of still being happy? The other man had to rise again to complete his misfortune.","Then, seeing his mother burst into tears, he began crying too and threw his arms round her neck. Oh God, what fresh misfortune was threatening? Wasn’t it enough to have lost in Honoré the only hope in her life, the certainty of forgetting and being happy again? No, the other man had to come back to complete her misery.","And when his mother burst into tears he clung about her neck and also began to howl dismally. Mon Dieu, what new evil was in store for her! Was it not enough that she had lost in Honore the one single hope of her life, the assured promise of oblivion and future happiness? and was that man to appear upon the scene again to make her misery complete?"
"Depuis longtemps, la soupe était mangée, l’attente continuait, lorsque, vers deux heures et demie, une sourde agitation, peu à peu croissante, gagna le camp entier. Des ordres coururent, on fit évacuer les prairies, toutes les troupes montèrent, se rangèrent sur les coteaux, entre deux villages, Chestres et Falaise, distants de quatre à cinq kilomètres. Déjà, le génie creusait des tranchées, établissait des épaulements ; pendant que, sur la gauche, l’artillerie de réserve couronnait un mamelon. Et le bruit se répandit que le général Bordas venait d’envoyer une estafette pour dire qu’ayant rencontré à Grand-Pré des forces supérieures, il était forcé de se replier sur Buzancy, ce qui faisait craindre que sa ligne de retraite sur Vouziers ne fût bientôt coupée. Aussi, le commandant du 7e corps, croyant à une attaque immédiate, avait-il fait prendre à ses hommes des positions de combat, afin de soutenir le premier choc, en attendant que le reste de l’armée vînt le soutenir ; et un de ses aides de camp était parti avec une lettre pour le maréchal, l’avertissant de la situation, demandant du secours. Enfin, comme il redoutait l’embarras de l’interminable convoi de vivres, qui avait rallié le corps pendant la nuit, et qu’il traînait de nouveau à sa suite, il le fit remettre en branle sur-le-champ, il le dirigea au petit bonheur, du côté de Chagny. C’était la bataille.","The soup had long been eaten, the wait continued, when, about half-past two, a dull agitation, gradually increasing, spread throughout the camp. Orders ran, the meadows were evacuated, all the troops mounted, lined up on the hillsides, between two villages, Chestres and Falaise, four or five kilometers apart. Already, engineers were digging trenches, establishing shoulders; while, on the left, the reserve artillery crowned a hillock. And the rumor spread that General Bordas had just sent a courier to say that having encountered superior forces at Grand-Pré, he was forced to fall back on Buzancy, which raised fears that his line of retreat on Vouziers was soon cut off. Also, the commander of the 7th corps, believing in an immediate attack, had his men take up combat positions, in order to sustain the first shock, while waiting for the rest of the army to come to support him; and one of his aides-de-camp had left with a letter for the Marshal, warning him of the situation, asking for help. Finally, as he feared the embarrassment of the interminable convoy of provisions, which had rallied the corps during the night, and which was trailing behind it again, he had it set in motion again at once, he headed haphazardly towards Chagny. It was the battle.","The stew had been eaten a long time ago and still they were waiting about when, at nearly half past two, the whole camp was permeated by a vague but increasing restlessness. Orders flew hither and thither, the fields were evacuated and all the troops climbed up and took positions on the ridges between two villages, Chestres and Falaise, about four or five kilometres apart. Already the sappers were digging trenches and throwing up ramparts while to the left the reserve artillery was on top of a mound. The tale went round that General Bordas had sent a dispatch rider to report that having met superior forces at Grand-Pré he was obliged to fall back on Buzancy, and that gave rise to fears that his line of retreat to Vouziers might soon be cut. That was why the commander of the 7th corps, thinking an attack was imminent, had moved his men into combat positions to sustain the first shock until the rest of the army could come to his support, and one of his aides-de-camp had gone off with a letter to the marshal, warning him about the situation and asking for help. So as he was frightened of being obstructed by the interminable supply column which had rejoined the corps during the night and which was now dragging after him again, he had made that set off at once, sending it any old where in the Chagny direction. It was battle order.","The soup had long since been made and eaten and everyone was waiting to see what would happen next, when, about half-past two o'clock, the smoldering excitement began to gain strength, and soon pervaded the entire camp. Hurried orders came to abandon the meadows, and the troops ascended a line of hills between two villages, Chestres and Falaise, some two or three miles apart, and took position there. Already the engineers were at work digging rifle-pits and throwing up epaulments; while over to the left the artillery had occupied the summit of a rounded eminence. The rumor spread that General Bordas had sent in a courier to announce that he had encountered the enemy in force at Grand-Pre and had been compelled to fall back on Buzancy, which gave cause to apprehend that he might soon be cut off from retreat on Vouziers. For these reasons, the commander of the 7th corps, believing an attack to be imminent, had placed his men in position to sustain the first onset until the remainder of the army should have time to come to his assistance, and had started off one of his aides-de-camp with a letter to the marshal, apprising him of the danger, and asking him for re-enforcements. Fearing for the safety of the subsistence train, which had come up with the corps during the night and was again dragging its interminable length in the rear, he summarily sent it to the right about and directed it to make the best of its way to Chagny. Things were beginning to look like fight."
– Et l’empereur est rentré à la ferme ? demanda le capitaine Beaudoin.,"""And the Emperor has returned to the farm?"" asked Captain Beaudoin.",‘And did the Emperor go back to the farmhouse?’ asked Captain Beaudoin.,“And did the Emperor return to the farmhouse?” asked Captain Beaudoin.

"Jean se mit debout, secoua la tête, pour s’assurer qu’elle était solide. Il n’avait plus que le crâne un peu lourd. Ça irait très bien. Et il fut saisi d’un attendrissement d’homme simple, il empoigna Maurice, l’étouffa sur son cœur, en ne trouvant que ces mots :","Jean stood up, shook his head, to make sure it was solid. He only had a slightly heavy head. It would go very well. And he was seized with the tenderness of a simple man, he seized Maurice, stifled him to his heart, finding only these words:",Jean stood up and shook his head to see if it felt all right. All he felt now was a bit of a headache. He’d be fine. He was overcome with a simple man’s emotion and threw his arms round Maurice and clasped him tight to his heart.,"Jean got on his legs and gave his head a shake to assure himself it was secure. It seemed a little heavier than usual, that was all; he thought he should get along well enough. A great wave of tenderness swept through his simple soul; he caught Maurice in his arms and hugged him to his bosom, while all he could find to say was:"
"N’était-ce pas, en effet, l’acte dernier et fatal, la folie du sang qui avait germé sur les champs de défaite de Sedan et de Metz, l’épidémie de destruction née du siège de Paris, la crise suprême d’une nation en danger de mort, au milieu des tueries et des écroulements ?","Was it not, in fact, the last and fatal act, the madness of blood which had germinated on the fields of defeat of Sedan and Metz, the epidemic of destruction born from the siege of Paris, the supreme crisis of a nation in danger of death, in the midst of killings and collapses?","Wasn’t this in fact the final, inevitable act, the blood-lust that had come into being in the disastrous fields of Sedan and Metz, the epidemic of destruction born in the siege of Paris, the final paroxysm of a nation in danger of death amidst all this slaughter and wreckage?","Was it not indeed the last act, the inevitable conclusion of the tragedy, the blood-madness for which the lost fields of Sedan and Metz were responsible, the epidemic of destruction born from the siege of Paris, the supreme struggle of a nation in peril of dissolution, in the midst of slaughter and universal ruin?"
"– Attention ! dit la domestique à Jean, l’escalier est raide.","- Attention ! said the servant to Jean, the stairs are steep.","‘Mind how you go!’ said the maid, ‘the stairs are very steep.’",the servant said to Jean; “the stairs are steep.”
"Elle dut céder, elle s’arrêta, debout, se haussant à chaque minute, regardant au loin, dans l’entêtée résolution de continuer sa route. Ce qu’elle entendait dire autour d’elle la renseignait. Des officiers se plaignaient amèrement de l’ordre de retraite qui leur avait fait abandonner Bazeilles, dès huit heures un quart, lorsque le général Ducrot, succédant au maréchal, s’était avisé de vouloir concentrer toutes les troupes sur le plateau d’Illy. Le pis était que, le 1er corps ayant reculé trop tôt, livrant le vallon de la Givonne aux Allemands, le 12e corps, attaqué déjà vivement de front, venait d’être débordé sur son flanc gauche. Puis, maintenant que le général de Wimpffen succédait au général Ducrot, le premier plan de nouveau l’emportait, l’ordre arrivait de réoccuper Bazeilles coûte que coûte, pour jeter les Bavarois à la Meuse. N’était-ce pas imbécile de leur avoir fait abandonner une position, qu’il leur fallait à cette heure reconquérir ? On voulait bien se faire tuer, mais pas pour le plaisir, vraiment !","She had to give in, she stopped, standing up, raising herself every minute, looking into the distance, in the stubborn resolution to continue on her way. What she heard around her informed her. Officers were complaining bitterly about the order to retreat which had made them abandon Bazeilles at a quarter past eight, when General Ducrot, succeeding the Marshal, took it into his head to want to concentrate all the troops on the Illy plateau. The worst was that, the 1st corps having retreated too soon, delivering the Givonne valley to the Germans, the 12th corps, already strongly attacked in front, had just been outflanked on its left flank. Then, now that General de Wimpffen had succeeded General Ducrot, the first plan once again won the day, the order arrived to reoccupy Bazeilles at all costs, in order to throw the Bavarians into the Meuse. Wasn't it foolish to have made them abandon a position which they now had to reconquer? We wanted to be killed, but not for fun, really!","She had to give in and stood still, jumping up every minute to see as far as she could, obstinately determined to go on her way. She gathered a little information from what she heard round her. Officers were bitterly complaining about the order to retreat which had made them abandon Bazeilles at quarter past eight when General Ducrot, taking over from the marshal, had got it into his head to try to concentrate all the troops on the plateau of Illy. The worst of it was that the 1st corps having fallen back too soon and thus handed over the Givonne valley to the Germans, the 12th, already under strong attack from the front, had been outflanked on its left. And now General de Wimpffen had succeeded General Ducrot and the original plan was in favour again, so that orders were coming in to reoccupy Bazeilles at all costs and throw the Bavarians into the Meuse. Wasn’t it crazy to have made them give up a position that they had now got to retake? They were prepared to face death, but really – not for fun!","She had to obey, and stood aside beneath the trees, raising herself on her toes at every moment to peer before her, firm in her resolve to continue her journey as soon as she should be allowed to pass. She learned the condition of affairs from the conversation that went on around her. Some officers were criticising with great acerbity the order for the abandonment of Bazeilles, which had occurred at a quarter-past eight, at the time when General Ducrot, taking over the command from the marshal, had considered it best to concentrate the troops on the plateau of Illy. What made matters worse was, that the valley of the Givonne having fallen into the hands of the Germans through the premature retirement of the 1st corps, the 12th corps, which was even then sustaining a vigorous attack in front, was overlapped on its left flank. Now that General de Wimpffen had relieved General Ducrot, it seemed that the original plan was to be carried out. Orders had been received to retake Bazeilles at every cost, and drive the Bavarians into the Meuse. And so, in the ranks of that regiment that had been halted there in full retreat at the entrance of the village and ordered to resume the offensive, there was much bitter feeling, and angry words were rife. Was ever such stupidity heard of? to make them abandon a position, and immediately tell them to turn round and retake it from the enemy! They were willing enough to risk their life in the cause, but no one cared to throw it away for nothing!"
"– Il y a près d’une heure qu’il est passé, répondit le voisin. Je l’ai accompagné, je l’ai vu sortir par la porte de Balan… Le bruit court qu’un boulet lui a emporté la tête.","“He passed nearly an hour ago,” replied the neighbor. I went with him, I saw him go out through the Balan door… There is a rumor that a cannonball took his head.","‘He went by nearly an hour ago,’ answered the neighbour. ‘I went along with him and saw him go out by the Balan gate. There’s a rumour that his head has been shot off.’","“He left the city near an hour ago,” replied the neighbor. “I was standing by and saw him pass out at the Balan gate. There is a rumor that his head was taken off by a cannon ball.”"
– Ah ! ces musiques ! finit par crier Maurice exaspéré. Elles m’entrent dans la peau !,– Ah! these music! ends up shouting Maurice exasperated.

"C’était un petit troupier, un soldat du 5e de ligne, engagé volontaire, qui n’avait pas vingt ans. Le surnom de « Pauvre enfant » lui était resté, parce que, sans cesse, il répétait ces mots en parlant de lui ; et, comme, un jour, on lui en demandait la raison, il avait répondu que c’était sa mère qui l’appelait toujours ainsi. Pauvre enfant en effet, car il se mourait d’une pleurésie, déterminée par une blessure au flanc gauche.","He was a small trooper, a soldier of the 5th line, enlisted as a volunteer, who was not yet twenty years old. The nickname ""Poor Child"" stuck with him, because he constantly repeated these words when speaking of himself; and when, one day, he was asked why, he replied that it was his mother who always called him that. Poor child indeed, for he was dying of pleurisy, caused by a wound in his left flank.","This was a young trooper in the fifth regiment of the line, who had enlisted as a volunteer and was not yet twenty. The nickname ‘Poor Kid’ had stuck to him because he constantly used these words about himself, and when one day somebody had asked him why, he had answered that his mother always called him that. Poor kid, indeed, for he was dying of pleurisy, the aftermath of a wound in his left side.","This was a little soldier, a private in the 5th of the line, not yet twenty years old, who had doubtless enlisted as a volunteer. The by-name : “Poor boy” had been given him and had stuck because he always used the words in speaking of himself, and when one day he was asked the reason he replied that that was the name by which his mother had always called him. Poor boy he was, in truth, for he was dying of pleurisy brought on by a wound in his left side."
"Alors, Maurice, les jambes cassées de fatigue, s’assit sur un banc. La ville, autour de lui, semblait vivre de sa vie quotidienne, et des bonnes, sous les beaux arbres, surveillaient des enfants, tandis que les petits rentiers faisaient d’un pas ralenti leur habituelle promenade. Il avait repris ses journaux, lorsqu’il tomba sur un article qui lui avait échappé, l’article d’une feuille ardente de l’opposition républicaine. Brusquement, tout s’éclaira. Le journal affirmait que, dans le conseil du 17, tenu au camp de Châlons, la retraite de l’armée sur Paris avait été décidée, et que la nomination du général Trochu n’était faite que pour préparer la rentrée de l’empereur. Mais il ajoutait que ces résolutions venaient de se briser devant l’attitude de l’impératrice-régente et du nouveau ministère. Pour l’impératrice, une révolution était certaine, si l’empereur reparaissait. On lui prêtait ce mot : « Il n’arriverait pas vivant aux Tuileries ». Aussi voulait-elle, de toute son entêtée volonté, la marche en avant, la jonction quand même avec l’armée de Metz, soutenue d’ailleurs par le général de Palikao, le nouveau ministre de la guerre, qui avait un plan de marche foudroyante et victorieuse, pour donner la main à Bazaine. Et, le journal glissé sur les genoux, Maurice maintenant, les regards perdus, croyait tout comprendre : les deux plans qui se combattaient, les hésitations du maréchal de Mac-Mahon à entreprendre cette marche de flanc si dangereuse avec des troupes peu solides, les ordres impatients, de plus en plus irrités, qui lui arrivaient de Paris, qui le poussaient à la témérité folle de cette aventure. Puis, au milieu de cette lutte tragique, il eut tout d’un coup la vision nette de l’empereur, démis de son autorité impériale qu’il avait confiée aux mains de l’impératrice-régente, dépouillé de son commandement de général en chef dont il venait d’investir le maréchal Bazaine, n’étant plus absolument rien, une ombre d’empereur, indéfinie et vague, une inutilité sans nom et encombrante, dont on ne savait quoi faire, que Paris repoussait et qui n’avait plus de place dans l’armée, depuis qu’il s’était engagé à ne pas même donner un ordre.","Then Maurice, his legs broken with fatigue, sat down on a bench. The town around him seemed to be living in its daily life, and maids, under the beautiful trees, watched the children, while the little pensioners took their usual walk with a slow step. He had gone back to his newspapers when he came across an article that had escaped him, the article from a fiery sheet of the Republican opposition. Suddenly, everything became clear. The newspaper affirmed that, in the council of the 17th, held at the camp of Châlons, the retreat of the army on Paris had been decided, and that the appointment of General Trochu was made only to prepare for the return of the Emperor. But he added that these resolutions had just been shattered by the attitude of the Empress-Regent and of the new ministry. For the Empress, a revolution was certain, if the Emperor reappeared. He was given this saying: ""He would not arrive alive at the Tuileries"". So she wanted, with all her stubborn will, the march forward, the junction all the same with the army of Metz, supported moreover by General de Palikao, the new Minister of War, who had a plan of march lightning and victorious, to give Bazaine a hand. And, the newspaper slipped on his knees, Maurice now, looking lost, thought he understood everything: the two opposing plans, the hesitations of Marshal de Mac-Mahon to undertake this dangerous flank march with flimsy troops, the impatient orders, more and more irritated, which came to him from Paris, which urged him to the mad temerity of this adventure. Then, in the midst of this tragic struggle, he suddenly had a clear vision of the Emperor, stripped of his imperial authority which he had entrusted to the hands of the Empress-Regent, stripped of his command as general in leader with whom he had just invested Marshal Bazaine, no longer being absolutely nothing, a shadow of an emperor, indefinite and vague, a nameless and cumbersome uselessness, with which no one knew what to do, which Paris rejected and which had no no place in the army, since he had pledged not to give an order.","Maurice sat on a seat to rest his legs which were worn out with fatigue. Round him the town seemed to be living its normal daily life – nurserymaids under the lovely trees, looking after children, and retired people taking their usual stroll with stately tread. He went back to his papers and came upon an article he had missed before in a violently republican sheet. Suddenly all was clear. The paper affirmed that at the council held on the 17th at the Châlons camp the retreat of the Paris army had been decided upon and the nomination of General Trochu was solely to prepare people for the Emperor’s return. But it added that these resolutions had come to grief when confronted with the attitude of the Empress-Regent and the new government. In the Empress’s opinion a revolution was inevitable if the Emperor reappeared, and she was credited with the words: ‘He would never reach the Tuileries alive.’ And so with all her obstinate determination she was set on an advance and a join-up with the army of Metz, whatever happened, and in this she was supported by General Palikao, the new Minister for War, who had a plan for a spectacular and victorious march to link up with Bazaine. Maurice let the paper slip on to his lap and gazing into space thought he could see it all: the two plans struggling against each other, the hesitations of Marshal MacMahon to undertake such a dangerous flanking movement with such unreliable troops, and impatient and increasingly peremptory orders from Paris urging him on to the foolish temerity of this adventure. Then in the midst of this tragic struggle he suddenly had a clear vision of the Emperor deprived of his imperial authority which he had entrusted to the Empress-Regent, stripped of his position as commander-in-chief with which he had just invested Marshal Bazaine, no longer anything at all, a shadow emperor, vague and indefinite, a nondescript, useless object and a nuisance that nobody knew what to do with, spurned by Paris and with no function left in the army, since he had undertaken not even to give an order.","Maurice's legs ached with fatigue; he went and sat down upon a bench. Around him the life of the city seemed to be going on as usual; there were nursemaids seated in the shade of the handsome trees watching the sports of their little charges, small property owners strolled leisurely about the walks enjoying their daily constitutional. He had taken up his papers again, when his eyes lighted on an article that had escaped his notice, the “leader” in a rabid republican sheet; then everything was made clear to him. The paper stated that at the council of the 17th at the camp of Chalons the retreat of the army on Paris had been fully decided on, and that General Trochu's appointment to the command of the city had no other object than to facilitate the Emperor's return; but those resolutions, the journal went on to say, were rendered unavailing by the attitude of the Empress-regent and the new ministry. It was the Empress's opinion that the Emperor's return would certainly produce a revolution; she was reported to have said: “He will never reach the Tuileries alive.” Starting with these premises she insisted with the utmost urgency that the army should advance, at every risk, whatever might be the cost of human life, and effect a junction with the army of Metz, in which course she was supported moreover by General de Palikao, the Minister of War, who had a plan of his own for reaching Bazaine by a rapid and victorious march. And Maurice, letting his paper fall from his hand, his eyes bent on space, believed that he now had the key to the entire mystery; the two conflicting plans, MacMahon's hesitation to undertake that dangerous flank movement with the unreliable army at his command, the impatient orders that came to him from Paris, each more tart and imperative than its predecessor, urging him on to that mad, desperate enterprise. Then, as the central figure in that tragic conflict, the vision of the Emperor suddenly rose distinctly before his inner eyes, deprived of his imperial authority, which he had committed to the hands of the Empress-regent, stripped of his military command, which he had conferred on Marshal Bazaine; a nullity, the vague and unsubstantial shadow of an emperor, a nameless, cumbersome nonentity whom no one knew what to do with, whom Paris rejected and who had ceased to have a position in the army, for he had pledged himself to issue no further orders."
"Du coup, les choses se gâtèrent. Lapoulle serrait les poings, et Pache, malgré sa douceur, affolé par la faim, voulait qu’on s’expliquât. Le plus raisonnable fut encore Loubet, qui se mit à rire, de son air avisé, en disant que c’était bête de se manger entre Français, lorsque les Prussiens étaient là. Lui, n’était pas pour les querelles, ni à coups de poing, ni à coups de fusil ; et, faisant allusion aux quelques centaines de francs qu’il avait touchées, comme remplaçant militaire, il ajouta :","Suddenly, things went wrong. Lapoulle clenched his fists, and Pache, in spite of his gentleness, maddened by hunger, wanted us to explain ourselves. The most reasonable was still Loubet, who began to laugh with his shrewd air, saying that it was foolish to eat Frenchmen when the Prussians were there. He was not for quarrels, neither with fists nor with gunshots; and, alluding to the few hundred francs he had received as a military substitute, he added:","Then things turned nasty. Lapoulle began clenching his fists, and Pache, for all his meekness, was crazed with hunger and demanding an explanation. The most sensible was Loubet once again, who began laughing his knowing laugh, saying it was daft for Frenchmen to be going for each other when the Prussians were just over there. He didn’t hold with quarrels, whether with fists or guns, and referring to the few hundred francs he had received as a conscript’s replacement, he added:","Things were beginning to assume an ugly complexion; Lapoulle was doubling his big fists in a way that looked like business, and Pache, with the pangs of hunger gnawing at his vitals, laid aside his natural douceness and insisted on an explanation. The only reasonable one among them was Loubet, who gave one of his pawky laughs and suggested that, being Frenchmen, they might as well dine off the Prussians as eat one another. For his part, he took no stock in fighting, either with fists or firearms, and alluding to the few hundred francs that he had earned as substitute, added:"
"– Au revoir, Maurice !","“Goodbye, Maurice!","‘Be seeing you, Maurice!’","“Au revoir, Maurice!”"
"Un silence se fit, pendant lequel la bataille, au loin, grondait plus haut. Et Maurice serrait les dents, pris d’une furieuse envie de crier. Pourquoi ne marchait-on pas au canon, tout de suite, sans tant de paroles ? Jamais il n’avait éprouvé une excitation pareille. Chaque coup lui répondait dans la poitrine, le soulevait, le jetait au besoin immédiat d’être là-bas, d’en être, d’en finir. Est-ce qu’ils allaient encore longer cette bataille, la toucher du coude, sans brûler une cartouche ? C’était une gageure, de les traîner ainsi depuis la déclaration de guerre, toujours fuyant ! À Vouziers, ils n’avaient entendu que les coups de feu de l’arrière-garde. À Oches, l’ennemi venait seulement de les canonner un instant, de dos. Et ils fileraient, ils n’iraient pas cette fois soutenir les camarades, au pas de course ! Maurice regarda Jean qui était, comme lui, très pâle, les yeux luisants de fièvre. Tous les cœurs sautaient dans les poitrines, à cet appel violent du canon.","A silence fell, during which the battle, in the distance, rumbled higher. And Maurice clenched his teeth, seized with a furious desire to cry out. Why didn't we march to the cannon, right away, without so many words? He had never felt such excitement before. Each blow answered him in the chest, lifted him up, threw him to the immediate need to be there, to be there, to end it. Would they still go along this battle, touch it with their elbows, without burning a cartridge? It was a challenge, to drag them like this since the declaration of war, always fleeing! At Vouziers, they had only heard shots from the rear guard. At Oches, the enemy had just shelled them for a moment, from behind. And they would spin, they would not this time support the comrades, at a run! Maurice looked at Jean who, like him, was very pale, his eyes shining with fever. All hearts leaped in their breasts at this violent call of the cannon.","There was a silence while the distant battle thundered louder. Maurice almost bit his tongue off, for he had a mad desire to scream. Why weren’t they marching to battle, now, without all this talk? He had never felt so worked up. Each round made his heart leap, lifted his spirit and gave him a desperate urge to be there, to be in it, to get it over. Were they once again going to skirt along the edge of this battle, rub elbows with it without firing a shot? It was against all reason to drag them round like this ever since the declaration of war, and always running away! At Vouziers all they had heard was shots from the rearguard. At Oches the enemy had just bombarded them for one minute – in the back. And still they were running away, this time they weren’t even going to race to the help of their comrades! He glanced at Jean who was very pale, like himself, with a feverish light in his eye. Every heart was leaping at this clarion call of the guns.","There was silence among them, while the battle raging in the distance growled more furiously than ever, and Maurice had to set tight his teeth to keep himself from speaking his mind aloud. Why did they not hasten whither the guns were calling them, without such waste of words? He had never known what it was to be excited thus; every discharge found an echo in his bosom and inspired him with a fierce longing to be present at the conflict, to put an end to it. Were they to pass by that battle, so near almost that they could stretch forth their arm and touch it with their hand, and never expend a cartridge? It must be to decide a wager that some one had made, that since the beginning of the campaign they were dragged about the country thus, always flying before the enemy! At Vouziers they had heard the musketry of the rear-guard, at Osches the German guns had played a moment on their retreating backs; and now they were to run for it again, they were not to be allowed to advance at double-quick to the succor of comrades in distress! Maurice looked at Jean, who was also very pale, his eyes shining with a bright, feverish light. Every heart leaped in every bosom at the loud summons of the artillery."
"À Bazeilles, dans la petite chambre noire, un brusque ébranlement fit sauter Weiss de son lit. Il écouta, c’était le canon. D’une main tâtonnante, il dut allumer la bougie, pour regarder l’heure à sa montre : quatre heures, le jour naissait à peine. Vivement, il prit son binocle, enfila d’un coup d’œil la grande rue, la route de Douzy qui traverse le village ; mais une sorte de poussière épaisse l’emplissait, on ne distinguait rien. Alors, il passa dans l’autre chambre, dont la fenêtre ouvrait sur les prés, vers la Meuse ; et, là, il comprit que des vapeurs matinales montaient du fleuve, noyant l’horizon. Le canon tonnait plus fort, là-bas, derrière ce voile, de l’autre côté de l’eau. Tout d’un coup, une batterie française répondit, si voisine et d’un tel fracas, que les murs de la petite maison tremblèrent.","In Bazeilles, in the little dark room, a sudden shock caused Weiss to jump out of bed. He listened, it was the cannon. With a groping hand, he had to light the candle, to look at the time on his watch: four o'clock, the day was barely dawning. Hastily, he took his binoculars, glanced down the main street, the road to Douzy which crosses the village; but a sort of thick dust filled it, nothing could be made out. Then he went into the other room, the window of which looked out over the meadows, towards the Meuse; and there he understood that morning vapors were rising from the river, drowning the horizon. The cannon thundered louder there, behind that veil, on the other side of the water. Suddenly, a French battery responded, so close and with such a roar, that the walls of the little house shook.","AT Bazeilles, in the dark little room, a sudden shock made Weiss leap out of bed. He listened. It was gunfire. He felt for the candle, which he had to light so as to see the time by his watch: four o’clock and only just beginning to get light. He seized his spectacles and looked up and down the main street, the Douzy road which runs through the village, but it was filled with a kind of thick dust and he could not make anything out. So he went into the other room, the window of which looked over on to the fields towards the Meuse, and he realized that the morning mists were coming off the river and obscuring the horizon. The gunfire was louder from over the river, beyond this veil. Suddenly a French battery replied, so near and with such a din that the walls of the little house shook.","Weiss, in the obscurity of his little room at Bazeilles, was aroused by a commotion that caused him to leap from his bed. It was the roar of artillery. Groping about in the darkness he found and lit a candle to enable him to consult his watch: it was four o'clock, just beginning to be light. He adjusted his double eyeglass upon his nose and looked out into the main street of the village, the road that leads to Douzy, but it was filled with a thick cloud of something that resembled dust, which made it impossible to distinguish anything. He passed into the other room, the windows of which commanded a view of the Meuse and the intervening meadows, and saw that the cause of his obstructed vision was the morning mist arising from the river. In the distance, behind the veil of fog, the guns were barking more fiercely across the stream. All at once a French battery, close at hand, opened in reply, with such a tremendous crash that the walls of the little house were shaken."
"Delaherche avait assisté à ces choses. Et il en frémissait, surtout en pensant que, dès qu’il aurait quitté la briqueterie, lui aussi allait se retrouver en plein sous les projectiles. Il s’attardait, il écoutait maintenant des officiers démontés qui étaient restés là.","Delaherche had witnessed these things. And he shuddered, especially thinking that, as soon as he left the brickyard, he too was going to find himself right in the middle of the projectiles. He lingered, he was now listening to disgruntled officers who had remained there.","Delaherche had witnessed all this. It made him shudder, especially when he reflected that as soon as he left the brickworks he also would be right in the path of the firing. He waited about and listened to some dismounted officers who had stayed there.","To all these events had Delaherche been witness, and now he trembled at the thought that he, too, as soon as he should have left the brick works, would have to run the gauntlet of those terrible projectiles. He lingered, listening to the conversation of some dismounted officers who had remained there."
"– Ma foi, répondit Maurice, ça m’a l’air d’être vers la Meuse… Seulement, le diable m’emporte si je me doute où je suis.","“Faith,” replied Maurice, “it seems to me to be near the Meuse… Only, the devil take me if I suspect where I am.","‘As far as I can tell,’ Maurice answered, ‘it seems to me to be over towards the Meuse, but the devil take me if I have the faintest idea where I am!’","“Faith,” replied Maurice, “it seems to me to be over toward the Meuse; but I'll be hanged if I know where we are.”"
"Elle s’interrompit, jeta un coup d’œil vers le perron.","She paused, glancing up at the porch.",She stopped short and glanced at the steps.,"She checked herself, casting a glance at the main entrance of the building."
"Sept heures, bon Dieu ! Ce fut un effarement. Jean, déjà tout vêtu, voulait courir, tandis que Maurice, encore au lit, se lamentait de ne pouvoir plus remuer les jambes. Comment retrouver les camarades ? l’armée n’avait-elle pas filé ? Et tous deux se fâchaient, on n’aurait pas dû les laisser dormir si longtemps. Mais Weiss eut un geste de désespérance.","Seven o'clock, good God! It was a bewilderment. Jean, already fully dressed, wanted to run, while Maurice, still in bed, lamented that he could no longer move his legs. How do I find classmates? hadn't the army slipped away? And both of them were angry, we shouldn't have let them sleep for so long. But Weiss gave a gesture of despair.","Seven o’clock, good God! This was terrifying. Jean, already fully dressed, was for running. But Maurice, still in bed, was moaning that he had lost the use of his legs. How were they to get back to their mates? Hadn’t the army moved on? They both began to get angry, they shouldn’t have been allowed to sleep on so long. But Weiss made a gesture of despair.","Great heavens, seven o'clock! They were thunderstruck. Jean, who by that time was completely dressed, would have run for it, but Maurice, still in bed, found he no longer had control of his legs; how were they ever to find their comrades? would not the army have marched away? They took Weiss to task for having let them sleep so long."
"– Capitaine, je vous présente une de mes plus chères amies… Elle désire se mettre sous votre protection, elle est la nièce du fermier qu’on a arrêté à Remilly, vous savez bien, à la suite de cette histoire de francs-tireurs.","“Captain, I present to you one of my dearest friends… She wishes to put herself under your protection, she is the niece of the farmer who was arrested at Remilly, you know, following this affair of the snipers.","‘Captain, may I introduce one of my best friends… She wants you to help her; she is the niece of the farmer they arrested at Remilly, you remember, after that fuss over the guerrillas.’","“Captain, I wish to make you acquainted with one of my dearest friends, who desires to place herself under your protection.

"– Vous savez que j’ai un frère soldat, continuait ardemment Henriette. Il est resté dans Paris, j’ai peur qu’il ne se soit mêlé à toute cette horrible lutte… Je vous en supplie, Otto, donnez-moi le moyen de continuer ma route.","“You know that I have a soldier brother,” Henriette continued ardently. He stayed in Paris, I'm afraid he got involved in all this horrible struggle... I beg you, Otto, give me the means to continue my journey.","‘You know I have a brother who is a soldier,’ Henriette hurriedly went on. ‘ He has stayed in Paris and I’m afraid he has got caught up in all this horrible fighting… Otto, I beg of you, help me to continue my journey.’","“You know I have a brother in the army,” Henriette eagerly went on. “He is in Paris; I fear he has allowed himself to become mixed up with this horrible conflict. O Otto, I beseech you, assist me to continue my journey.”"
"Cependant, une fois encore, la batterie était démontée. On ne pouvait pousser plus loin la folie héroïque. L’ordre allait être crié de se replier définitivement.","However, once again the battery was disassembled. The heroic folly could not be pushed any further. The order was about to be shouted to withdraw definitively.",So once again the battery was in confusion. Foolhardy heroism could not be taken any further. The order to fall back definitely could not long be delayed.,"For the third time, however, the strength of the battery was so reduced as practically to disable it.

"Resté seul, Delaherche suffoqua. Eh quoi ? c’était vrai, on allait recommencer à se battre, incendier et raser Sedan ! Cela devenait inévitable, l’effrayante chose aurait certainement lieu, dès que le soleil serait assez haut sur les collines, pour éclairer l’horreur du massacre. Et, machinalement, il escalada une fois encore l’escalier raide des greniers, il se retrouva parmi les cheminées, au bord de l’étroite terrasse qui dominait la ville. Mais, à cette heure, il était là-haut en pleines ténèbres, dans une mer infinie et roulante de grandes vagues sombres, où d’abord il ne distingua absolument rien. Puis, ce furent les bâtiments de la fabrique, au-dessous de lui, qui se dégagèrent les premiers, en masses confuses qu’il reconnaissait : la chambre de la machine, les salles des métiers, les séchoirs, les magasins ; et cette vue, ce pâté énorme de constructions, qui était son orgueil et sa richesse, le bouleversa de pitié sur lui-même, quand il eut songé que, dans quelques heures, il n’en resterait que des cendres. Ses regards remontèrent vers l’horizon, firent le tour de cette immensité noire, où dormait la menace du lendemain. Au midi, du côté de Bazeilles, des flammèches s’envolaient, au-dessus des maisons qui tombaient en braise ; tandis que, vers le nord, la ferme du bois de la Garenne, incendiée le soir, brûlait toujours, ensanglantant les arbres d’une grande clarté rouge. Pas d’autres feux, rien que ces deux flamboiements, un insondable abîme, traversé de la seule épouvante des rumeurs éparses. Là-bas, peut-être très loin, peut-être sur les remparts, quelqu’un pleurait. Vainement, il tâchait de percer le voile, de voir le Liry, la Marfée, les batteries de Frénois et de Wadelincourt, cette ceinture de bêtes de bronze qu’il sentait là, le cou tendu, la gueule béante. Et, comme il ramenait les regards sur la ville, autour de lui, il en entendit le souffle d’angoisse. Ce n’était pas seulement le mauvais sommeil des soldats tombés par les rues, le sourd craquement de cet amas d’hommes, de bêtes et de canons. Ce qu’il croyait saisir, c’était l’insomnie anxieuse des bourgeois, ses voisins, qui eux non plus ne pouvaient dormir, secoués de fièvre, dans l’attente du jour. Tous devaient savoir que la capitulation n’était pas signée, et tous comptaient les heures, grelottaient à l’idée que, si elle ne se signait pas, ils n’auraient qu’à descendre dans leurs caves, pour y mourir, écrasés, murés sous les décombres. Il lui sembla qu’une voix éperdue montait de la rue des Voyards, criant à l’assassin, au milieu d’un brusque cliquetis d’armes. Il se pencha, il resta dans l’épaisse nuit, perdu en plein ciel de brume, sans une étoile, enveloppé d’un tel frisson, que tout le poil de sa chair se hérissait.","Left alone, Delaherche suffocated. What? it was true, we were going to start fighting again, set fire to and raze Sedan! It was becoming inevitable, the terrible thing would certainly take place, as soon as the sun was high enough on the hills, to illuminate the horror of the massacre. And, mechanically, he climbed once more the steep staircase of the attics, he found himself among the chimneys, at the edge of the narrow terrace which overlooked the town. But at this hour he was up there in total darkness, in an endless rolling sea of great dark waves, where at first he could make out absolutely nothing. Then it was the factory buildings below him that emerged first, in confused masses that he recognized: the machine room, the trade rooms, the dryers, the stores; and this sight, this enormous block of constructions, which was his pride and his wealth, overwhelmed him with pity on himself, when he had thought that in a few hours only ashes would remain. His gaze went up to the horizon, circled this black immensity, where the threat of tomorrow slept. To the south, near Bazeilles, sparks flew above the houses which were falling to embers; while, to the north, the farm in the Bois de la Garenne, set on fire in the evening, was still burning, bloodying the trees with a great red light. No other fires, only these two blazes, an unfathomable abyss, traversed by the sole terror of scattered rumors. Over there, perhaps far away, perhaps on the ramparts, someone was crying. In vain he tried to pierce the veil, to see the Liry, the Marfée, the batteries of Frénois and Wadelincourt, that belt of bronze beasts which he felt there, necks outstretched, jaws gaping. And, as he turned his gaze back to the city, around him, he heard its breath of anguish. It was not only the bad sleep of the soldiers fallen by the streets, the dull creaking of this mass of men, beasts and cannons. What he thought he grasped was the anxious insomnia of the bourgeois, his neighbors, who could not sleep either, shaken with fever, waiting for daylight. Everyone must have known that the capitulation was not signed, and everyone was counting the hours, shivering at the idea that, if it was not signed, they would only have to go down to their cellars, to die there, crushed, walled in rubble. It seemed to him that a distraught voice rose from the Rue des Voyards, crying out for the assassin, amidst a sudden clash of arms. He bent down, he remained in the thick night, lost in the misty sky, without a star, enveloped in such a shiver that all the hair on his flesh stood on end.","Left on his own, Delaherche was outraged. What, were they really going to start fighting again and burn Sedan down? It was becoming inevitable, and this appalling thing would certainly come about as soon as the sun was sufficiently high above the hills to give enough light for the horrible massacre. Once again he automatically climbed the steep stairs to the attics and found himself among the chimneys on the narrow ledge overlooking the town. But at that hour up there he was in total darkness, in an endless rolling sea of black waves and at first he could not make out anything whatever. The factory buildings below him were the first things to emerge in vague masses he could recognize: the engine-house, the loom-shops, drying-sheds, stores; and the sight of the huge block of buildings, his pride and wealth, broke him down with self-pity as he reflected that in a few hours nothing would be left of it but ashes. His eyes went up to the horizon and travelled along this black immensity in which tomorrow’s threat lay dormant. Southwards in the Bazeilles direction sparks were blowing over houses which were collapsing in ashes, while northwards the farm in the Garenne woods which had been set on fire that evening was still burning and throwing a bloody glare on to the trees. No other fires, only those two blazes, and between them a bottomless chasm with nothing but scattered, frightening noises. Over there, maybe a long way off, maybe on the ramparts, somebody was crying. He tried in vain to pierce the veil and see Le Liry, La Marfée, the batteries at Frénois and Wadelincourt, the circle of bronze beasts of prey that he sensed were there, straining forward with open jaws. As he brought his eyes back to the town round him, he could hear its anguished breathing. It was not merely the uneasy sleep of the soldiers lying in the streets, the faint creakings of the mass of men and animals and cannons. What he seemed to be hearing was the anxious insomnia of townspeople and neighbours who couldn’t sleep any more than he could, but were feverishly waiting for daylight. They must all be aware that the capitulation was not signed, and were all counting the hours and shudderingly thinking that if it were not signed there would be nothing for them to do but go down into their cellars and die there, crushed and buried beneath the ruins. He thought a wild voice came up from the rue des Voyards crying Murder! amid a sudden clicking of rifles. He stayed there leaning over into the thick night, lost in a misty starless sky, and taken with such a shivering that all the hairs on his body seemed to be standing on end.","When left by himself Delaherche could hardly breathe. What, could it be true that they were going to fight again, were going to burn and raze Sedan! It was certainly to be, soon as the morrow's sun should be high enough upon the hills to light the horror of the sacrifice. And once again he almost unconsciously climbed the steep ladder that led to the roofs and found himself standing among the chimneys, at the edge of the narrow terrace that overlooked the city; but at that hour of the night the darkness was intense and he could distinguish absolutely nothing amid the swirling waves of the Cimmerian sea that lay beneath him. Then the buildings of the factory below were the first objects which, one by one, disentangled themselves from the shadows and stood out before his vision in indistinct masses, which he had no difficulty in recognizing: the engine-house, the shops, the drying rooms, the storehouses, and when he reflected that within twenty-four hours there would remain of that imposing block of buildings, his fortune and his pride, naught save charred timbers and crumbling walls, he overflowed with pity for himself. He raised his glance thence once more to the horizon, and sent it traveling in a circuit around that profound, mysterious veil of blackness behind which lay slumbering the menace of the morrow. To the south, in the direction of Bazeilles, a few quivering little flames that rose fitfully on the air told where had been the site of the unhappy village, while toward the north the farmhouse in the wood of la Garenne, that had been fired late in the afternoon, was burning still, and the trees about were dyed of a deep red with the ruddy blaze. Beyond the intermittent flashing of those two baleful fires no light to be seen; the brooding silence unbroken by any sound save those half-heard mutterings that pass through the air like harbingers of evil; about them, everywhere, the unfathomable abyss, dead and lifeless. Off there in the distance, very far away, perhaps, perhaps upon the ramparts, was a sound of someone weeping. It was all in vain that he strained his eyes to pierce the veil, to see something of Liry, la Marfee, the batteries of Frenois, and Wadelincourt, that encircling belt of bronze monsters of which he could instinctively feel the presence there, with their outstretched necks and yawning, ravenous muzzles. And as he recalled his glance and let it fall upon the city that lay around and beneath him, he heard its frightened breathing. It was not alone the unquiet slumbers of the soldiers who had fallen in the streets, the blending of inarticulate sounds produced by that gathering of guns, men, and horses; what he fancied he could distinguish was the insomnia, the alarmed watchfulness of his bourgeois neighbors, who, no more than he, could sleep, quivering with feverish terrors, awaiting anxiously the coming of the day. They all must be aware that the capitulation had not been signed, and were all counting the hours, quaking at the thought that should it not be signed the sole resource left them would be to go down into their cellars and wait for their own walls to tumble in on them and crush the life from their bodies. The voice of one in sore straits came up, it seemed to him, from the Rue des Voyards, shouting: “Help! murder!” amid the clash of arms. He bent over the terrace to look, then remained aloft there in the murky thickness of the night where there was not a star to cheer him, wrapped in such an ecstasy of terror that the hairs of his body stood erect."

"Il continua, la main tendue. Le plateau de l’Algérie, une bande de terre rougeâtre, longue de trois kilomètres, descendait en pente douce du bois de la Garenne à la Meuse, dont des prairies le séparaient. C’était là que le général Douay avait rangé le 7e corps, désespéré de n’avoir pas assez d’hommes pour défendre une ligne si développée et pour se relier solidement au 1er corps, qui occupait, perpendiculairement à lui, le vallon de la Givonne, du bois de la Garenne à Daigny.","He continued, hand outstretched. The plateau of Algeria, a strip of reddish land, three kilometers long, sloped gently from the Bois de la Garenne to the Meuse, from which meadows separated it. It was there that General Douay had ranged the 7th corps, in despair at not having enough men to defend such a developed line and to link up solidly with the 1st corps, which occupied, perpendicularly to him, the valley of the Givonne, from the Bois de la Garenne to Daigny.","He went on pointing things out. The plateau of Algérie was a belt of red earth about three kilometres long that sloped gently from the Garenne wood to the Meuse, from which it was separated by the meadows. It was there that General Douay had stationed the 7th corps, in despair at not having enough men to defend such a long drawn-out line and link up firmly with the 1st corps which was at right angles to him, occupying the valley of the Givonne, from the Garenne wood to Daigny.","He went on to explain their position, naming each locality and pointing to it with outstretched hand. The plateau de l'Algerie was a belt of reddish ground, something less than two miles in length, sloping gently downward from the wood of la Garenne toward the Meuse, from which it was separated by the meadows. On it the line of the 7th corps had been established by General Douay, who felt that his numbers were not sufficient to defend so extended a position and properly maintain his touch with the 1st corps, which was posted at right angles with his line, occupying the valley of la Givonne, from the wood of la Garenne to Daigny."
"D’un geste, Madame Delaherche l’interrompit. Depuis que le canon tonnait, elle s’inquiétait, guettait le retour de son fils. Mais c’était une mère héroïque. Et elle se ressouvint de ce qu’elle était montée faire.","With a gesture, Madame Delaherche interrupted him. Ever since the cannon thundered, she had been worried, watching for her son's return. But she was a heroic mother. And she remembered what she had come up to do.","Madame Delaherche cut her short with a gesture. She had been worrying ever since the gunfire began, and watching out for her son’s return. But she was a heroic mother. And then she remembered what she had come to do.","Madame Delaherche interrupted her with a grave nod of her head. Ever since the artillery had commenced to roar she had been watching eagerly for her son's return, but she was a Spartan mother, and concealed her gnawing anxiety under a cloak of brave silence. And then she remembered what was the object of her visit there."

"D’autres maisons s’allumaient, Bazeilles n’allait plus être qu’un brasier. Par les hautes fenêtres de l’église, des gerbes de flammes commençaient à sortir. Des soldats, qui chassaient une vieille dame de chez elle, venaient de la forcer à leur donner des allumettes, pour mettre le feu à son lit et à ses rideaux. De proche en proche, les incendies gagnaient, sous les brandons de paille jetés, sous les flots de pétrole répandus ; et ce n’était plus qu’une guerre de sauvages, enragés par la longueur de la lutte, vengeant leurs morts, leurs tas de morts, sur lesquels ils marchaient. Des bandes hurlaient parmi la fumée et les étincelles, dans l’effrayant vacarme fait de tous les bruits, des plaintes d’agonie, des coups de feu, des écroulements. À peine se voyait-on, de grandes poussières livides s’envolaient, cachaient le soleil, d’une insupportable odeur de suie et de sang, comme chargées des abominations du massacre. On tuait encore, on détruisait dans tous les coins : la brute lâchée, l’imbécile colère, la folie furieuse de l’homme en train de manger l’homme.","Other houses lit up, Bazeilles was going to be nothing more than a blaze. From the high windows of the church, sheaves of flames were beginning to come out. Some soldiers, who were chasing an old lady from her house, had just forced her to give them matches to set fire to her bed and curtains. Little by little, the fires spread, under the thrown straw brands, under the spilled floods of petrol; and it was no more than a war of savages, enraged by the length of the struggle, avenging their dead, their heaps of dead, on which they walked. Bands howled among the smoke and the sparks, in the frightful din made up of all the noises, the cries of agony, the shots, the collapses. As soon as we saw each other, great livid dust flew away, hid the sun, with an unbearable odor of soot and blood, as if laden with the abominations of the massacre. They were still killing, they were destroying in every corner: the unleashed brute, the imbecile anger, the furious madness of the man eating the man.","Other houses were on fire and Bazeilles would soon be nothing but a furnace. Tongues of flame were beginning to come from the lofty windows of the church. Soldiers chasing an old lady out of her house had forced her to give them some matches so as to set fire to her bed and curtains. By degrees the fires were spreading as straw firebrands were thrown and quantities of oil poured about, It was now nothing but a war of savages frenzied by the length of the struggle, avenging their dead, the heaps of their dead on which they had to tread. Bands of men were bawling amid the smoke and sparks, in a frightful din made up of all kinds of noises, the moans of the dying, shots, crashed buildings. People could scarcely see each other for great livid clouds of swirling dust, which stank intolerably of soot and blood as though filled with the abominations of massacre, and which hid the light of the sun. The killing was still going on, with destruction in every corner: the wild beast let loose, the raving madness of men in the act of destroying their fellow men.","Other houses had taken fire; Bazeilles was now a roaring, blazing furnace. Flames had begun to appear at the tall windows of the church and were creeping upward toward the roof. Some soldiers who were driving a venerable lady from her home had compelled her to furnish the matches with which to fire her own beds and curtains. Lighted by blazing brands and fed by petroleum in floods, fires were rising and spreading in every quarter; it was no longer civilized warfare, but a conflict of savages, maddened by the long protracted strife, wreaking vengeance for their dead, their heaps of dead, upon whom they trod at every step they took. Yelling, shouting bands traversed the streets amid the scurrying smoke and falling cinders, swelling the hideous uproar into which entered sounds of every kind: shrieks, groans, the rattle of musketry, the crash of falling walls. Men could scarce see one another; great livid clouds drifted athwart the sun and obscured his light, bearing with them an intolerable stench of soot and blood, heavy with the abominations of the slaughter. In every quarter the work of death and destruction still went on: the human brute unchained, the imbecile wrath, the mad fury, of man devouring his brother man."
"Laurent, en pantalon et en veste de toile bleue, était un garçon jardinier du voisinage, âgé d’une trentaine d’années, et qui avait perdu récemment sa mère et sa femme, emportées par la même mauvaise fièvre.","Laurent, in slacks and a blue linen jacket, was a neighborhood gardener, about thirty years old, who had recently lost his mother and wife to the same bad fever.","Laurent, in his blue shirt and trousers, was a gardener in the village, about thirty, who had recently lost his mother and his wife in the same influenza epidemic.","Laurent was dressed in jacket and trousers of blue cloth; he was helper to a gardener of the neighborhood, and had lately lost his mother and his wife, both of whom had been carried off by the same insidious fever."
"Alors, Maurice appuya le canon de son chassepot sur un chou qu’il avait devant lui. Mais on ne voyait plus rien, ainsi au ras du sol : des terrains s’étendaient, confus, coupés de verdures. Et il poussa le coude de Jean, allongé à sa droite, en demandant ce qu’on fichait là. Jean, expérimenté, lui montra, sur un tertre voisin, une batterie qu’on était en train d’établir. Évidemment, on les avait postés à cette place pour soutenir cette batterie. Pris de curiosité, Maurice se releva, désireux de savoir si Honoré n’en était pas, avec sa pièce ; mais l’artillerie de réserve se trouvait en arrière, à l’abri d’un bouquet d’arbres.","Then Maurice rested the barrel of his Chassepot on a cabbage in front of him. But you could no longer see anything, thus level with the ground: land stretched out, confused, cut through with greenery. And he nudged Jean, who was lying on his right, asking what they were doing there. Jean, experienced, showed him, on a nearby mound, a battery that was being established. Obviously, we had posted them there to support this battery. Taken by curiosity, Maurice got up, eager to know if Honoré was not one, with his play; but the reserve artillery was in the rear, sheltered by a clump of trees.","Maurice supported the barrel of his rifle on a cabbage in front of him. But you couldn’t see anything down at ground level like this, for the earth stretched on and was quite featureless, cut up by greenery. He nudged Jean, who was stretched out on his right, and asked him what the hell they were supposed to be doing. Jean, as an experienced soldier, showed him a battery they were installing on a near-by hillock. Clearly they had been positioned here to support this battery. Out of curiosity he stood up to see whether Honoré and his cannon were involved, but the reserve artillery was in the rear, protected by a clump of trees.","Maurice rested the barrel of his musket on a cabbage that reared its head conveniently before him, but it was impossible to see anything in his recumbent position: only the blurred surface of the fields traversed by his level glance, diversified by an occasional tree or shrub. Giving Jean, who was beside him, a nudge with his elbow, he asked what they were to do there. The corporal, whose experience in such matters was greater, pointed to an elevation not far away, where a battery was just taking its position; it was evident that they had been placed there to support that battery, should there be need of their services. Maurice, wondering whether Honore and his guns were not of the party, raised his head to look, but the reserve artillery was at the rear, in the shelter of a little grove of trees."
"– Non, non.",- No no.,"‘No, no.’","“No, no.”"
"– C’est un oiseau que nous avons rencontré, expliqua Loubet de sa voix de loustic, et qui a voulu faire notre connaissance.","""It's a bird we met,"" explained Loubet in his quizzical voice, ""and who wanted to meet us.","‘It’s a bird we happened to meet,’ explained Loubet in his professional funny-man’s voice, ‘and she wanted to make our acquaintance.’","“We were out walking and met the bird,” Loubet explained in an unctuously sanctimonious voice, “and it insisted on making our acquaintance.”"
"Le brouillard, pourtant, se levait. Ce fut soudain, comme à Bazeilles, le déroulement d’un décor, derrière le flottant rideau qui remontait avec lenteur vers les frises. Un clair ruissellement de soleil tombait du ciel bleu. Et tout de suite Maurice reconnut l’endroit où ils attendaient.","The fog, however, was lifting. There was suddenly, as in Bazeilles, the unfolding of a decor, behind the floating curtain which rose slowly towards the friezes. A clear stream of sunlight fell from the blue sky. And immediately Maurice recognized the place where they were waiting.","However the fog was really lifting. It was quite sudden, as at Bazeilles, like a stage set discovered behind the floating curtain as it slowly goes up into the flies. The bright sun poured down from a blue sky. At once Maurice realized where they were standing waiting.","The fog dispersed at last, this time in earnest. As at Bazeilles the effect was theatrical; the curtain rolled slowly upward to the flies, disclosing the setting of the stage. From a sky of transparent blue the sun poured down a flood of bright, golden light, and Maurice was no longer at a loss to recognize their position. “Ah!”"
"Mais les regards d’Henriette venaient de tomber sur une paire de gants d’ordonnance, des gants d’homme oubliés sur un guéridon ; et elle n’avait pu retenir un mouvement. Alors, Gilberte rougit beaucoup, l’attira au bord du lit, d’un geste confus et câlin. Puis, se cachant la face contre son épaule :","But Henriette's eyes had just fallen on a pair of orderly gloves, men's gloves forgotten on a pedestal table; and she could not restrain a movement. Then Gilberte blushed deeply and drew him to the edge of the bed with a confused and coaxing gesture. Then, hiding her face against her shoulder:","But Henriette’s eye had been caught by a pair of army gloves, a man’s gloves, forgotten on a table, and she had not managed to restrain a start. Then Gilberte went very red and drew her over to the bed with a confused and affectionate movement and buried her face in her shoulder.","But Henriette, in looking about the room, had caught sight of a pair of gauntlets, the gloves of a man, lying forgotten on a small table, and she started perceptibly. Gilberte blushed deeply, and extending her arms with a conscious, caressing movement, drew her friend to her and rested her head upon her bosom. “Yes,” she almost whispered, “I saw that you noticed it."
"En effet, la deuxième attaque des Bavarois venait d’être repoussée. Les mitrailleuses avaient de nouveau balayé la place de l’Église, des entassements de cadavres y barraient le pavé, au grand soleil ; et, de toutes les ruelles, à la baïonnette, on rejetait l’ennemi dans les prés, une débandade, une fuite vers le fleuve, qui se serait à coup sûr changée en déroute, si des troupes fraîches avaient soutenu les marins, déjà exténués et décimés. D’autre part, dans le parc de Montivilliers, la fusillade n’avançait guère, ce qui indiquait que, de ce côté aussi, des renforts auraient dégagé le bois.","Indeed, the second attack of the Bavarians had just been repelled. The machine guns had once again swept the Place de l'Eglise, heaps of corpses barred the pavement there, in the bright sunshine; and, from all the lanes, with bayonets, the enemy was thrown back into the meadows, a stampede, a flight towards the river, which would certainly have turned into a rout, if fresh troops had supported the sailors, already exhausted. and decimated. On the other hand, in the park of Montivilliers, the shooting was not advancing much, which indicated that, on this side too, reinforcements would have cleared the wood.","And indeed the second Bavarian attack had been repulsed. Once again the machine guns had raked the church square, and piles of corpses blocked the roadway in the bright sunlight, and from all the little alleys the enemy was being thrust back with the bayonet into the fields in headlong flight riverwards, which would certainly have become a rout if fresh troops had reinforced the exhausted and thinned ranks of the marines. Moreover, in the Montvillers park the fusillade was not making very much progress, which showed that on that side also a few reinforcements would have cleared the wood of the enemy.","It was true that the Bavarians' second attack had been repulsed. The mitrailleuses had again swept the Place de l'Eglise, the heaps of corpses in the square resembled barricades, and our troops, emerging from every cross street, had driven the enemy at the point of the bayonet through the meadows toward the river in headlong flight, which might easily have been converted into a general rout had there been fresh troops to support the sailor-boys, who had suffered severely and were by this time much distressed. And in Montivilliers Park, again, the firing did not seem to advance, which was a sign that in that quarter, also, reinforcements, could they have been had, would have cleared the wood."
"En effet, dès qu’ils entrèrent dans la rue Maqua, ils aperçurent de loin plusieurs têtes, penchées à une des fenêtres monumentales de la fabrique. Puis, ils reconnurent Delaherche et sa femme Gilberte, accoudés, ayant, derrière eux, debout, la haute figure sévère de madame Delaherche. Ils avaient des pains, le fabricant les lançait aux affamés qui tendaient des mains tremblantes, implorantes.","Indeed, as soon as they entered rue Maqua, they saw several heads from afar, leaning out of one of the factory's monumental windows. Then they recognized Delaherche and his wife Gilberte, leaning on their elbows, having behind them, standing, the tall, severe face of Madame Delaherche. They had loaves, the maker tossed them to the hungry who held out trembling, imploring hands.","And indeed, as soon as they entered rue Maqua, they caught sight of several heads hanging out of one of the enormous windows of the mill. Then they recognized Delaherche and his wife Gilberte leaning out, with the tall, austere figure of Madame Delaherche standing behind them. They had some loaves of bread and he was throwing them down to the hungry men holding out shaky, imploring hands.","They had scarce more than struck into the Rue Maqua, indeed, when they became aware of several pairs of eyes turned on the column from one of the tall windows of the factory, and as they drew nearer recognized Delaherche and his wife Gilberte, their elbows resting on the railing of the balcony, and behind them the tall, rigid form of old Madame Delaherche. They had a supply of bread with them, and the manufacturer was tossing the loaves down into the hands that were upstretched with tremulous eagerness to receive them."
"Tous deux se turent, un silence épouvanté régna. En effet, des crues subites de flammes montaient sans cesse, débordaient dans le ciel, en ruissellements de fournaise. À chaque minute, la mer de feu élargissait sa ligne d’infini, une houle incandescente d’où s’exhalaient maintenant des fumées qui amassaient, au-dessus de la ville, une immense nuée de cuivre sombre ; et un léger vent devait la pousser, elle s’en allait lentement à travers la nuit noire, barrant la voûte de son averse scélérate de cendre et de suie.","Both were silent, a terrified silence reigned. Indeed, sudden floods of flames rose constantly, overflowing into the sky, in streams of furnace. Every minute the sea of fire widened its line of infinity, an incandescent swell from which now exhaled smoke which gathered, above the city, an immense cloud of dark copper; and a light wind was to push it, it went slowly through the dark night, barring the vault with its wicked shower of ash and soot.","They said no more, and there was a terrified silence. And indeed sudden new bursts of flame were continually rising, filling the sky like a furnace overflowing. Every minute the sea of fire went on broadening to infinity like an incandescent tide from which there were now going up columns of smoke that gathered together above the city into an immense dark copper-coloured cloud. A light wind must be blowing it, for it was slowly moving away through the black night, filling the vault of heaven with its foul rain of ash and soot.","Neither spoke for a long time; an awed silence rested on them. The great waves of flame continued to ascend, sending up streamers and ribbons of vivid light high into the heavens. Beneath the sea of fire was every moment extending its boundaries, a tossing, stormy, burning ocean, whence now arose dense clouds of smoke that collected over the city in a huge pall of a somber coppery hue, which was wafted slowly athwart the blackness of the night, streaking the vault of heaven with its accursed rain of ashes and of soot."
"Elle eut un frémissement, elle bégaya davantage.","She shuddered, she stuttered more.",A shudder ran through her and her speech became even more confused.,"A shiver passed through her frame, her voice was scarcely audible."
"– Alors, elle est couchée ?","""So she's in bed?""","‘Well, has she gone to bed?’","“She has gone to bed, then?”"
"Dès le coucher du soleil, l’incendie du Grenier d’abondance avait enflammé les quartiers lointains, en haut de la coulée de la Seine. Aux Tuileries, au Conseil d’État, les plafonds devaient crouler, activant le brasier des poutres qui se consumaient, car des foyers partiels s’étaient rallumés, des flammèches et des étincelles montaient par moments. Beaucoup des maisons qu’on croyait éteintes, se remettaient ainsi à flamber. Depuis trois jours, l’ombre ne pouvait se faire, sans que la ville parût reprendre feu, comme si les ténèbres eussent soufflé sur les tisons rouges encore, les ravivant, les semant aux quatre coins de l’horizon. Ah ! cette ville d’enfer qui rougeoyait dès le crépuscule, allumée pour toute une semaine, éclairant de ses torches monstrueuses les nuits de la semaine sanglante ! Et, cette nuit-là, quand les docks de la Villette brûlèrent, la clarté fut si vive sur la cité immense, qu’on put la croire réellement incendiée par tous les bouts, cette fois, envahie et noyée sous les flammes. Dans le ciel saignant, les quartiers rouges, à l’infini, roulaient le flot de leurs toitures de braise.","As soon as the sun set, the fire in the Grenier d'Abondance had set fire to the distant districts, at the top of the Seine. At the Tuileries, at the Council of State, the ceilings must have crumbled, activating the brazier of the beams which were smoldering, because partial hearths had been rekindled, flames and sparks rose from time to time. Many of the houses that were thought to be extinct, thus began to burn again. For three days there had been no darkness without the city seeming to catch fire again, as if the darkness had blown on the red embers again, reviving them, scattering them at the four corners of the horizon. Ah! this city of hell which glowed red at dusk, lit for a whole week, illuminating with its monstrous torches the nights of the bloody week! And, that night, when the docks of La Villette were burning, the light was so bright over the immense city, that one could believe it was really on fire at all ends, this time invaded and drowned in flames. In the bleeding sky, the red districts, to infinity, rolled the flood of their roofs of embers.","As soon as the sun set, the fire at the Grenier d’Abondance had lit up the districts far away up the Seine. In the Tuileries and the Conseil d’Etat ceilings must have been falling in and reviving the glowing timbers, for small fires had started again and flakes of flame and sparks shot up now and again. Many of the buildings thought to be burnt out flared up again like this. For three days it no sooner got dark than the city seemed to burn up again, as though the darkness itself had blown on the red embers and revived them and scattered them to every point on the horizon. What a hellish city it was, that glowed red when dusk came and illumined with monstrous torches the nights of all that bloody week! On that particular night, when the warehouses of La Villette were burned, the light was so bright all over the great city that this time it was really possible to think it was on fire everywhere, overwhelmed and submerged by the flames… Under a bloody sky the districts of Paris, red as far as the eye could see, were like a rolling sea of fiery roofs.","As soon as daylight began to fade, the distant quarters beyond the Seine had been lighted up by the burning of the Grenier d'Abondance. From time to time there was an outburst of flame, accompanied by a shower of sparks, from the smoking ruins of the Tuileries, as some wall or ceiling fell and set the smoldering timbers blazing afresh. Many houses, where the fire was supposed to be extinguished, flamed up anew; for the last three days, as soon as darkness descended on the city it seemed as if it were the signal for the conflagrations to break out again; as if the shades of night had breathed upon the still glowing embers, reanimating them, and scattering them to the four corners of the horizon. Ah, that city of the damned, that had harbored for a week within its bosom the demon of destruction, incarnadining the sky each evening as soon as twilight fell, illuminating with its infernal torches the nights of that week of slaughter! And when, that night, the docks at la Villette burned, the light they shed upon the huge city was so intense that it seemed to be on fire in every part at once, overwhelmed and drowned beneath the sea of flame. “Ah, it is the end!”"
"Des heures durent se passer, tout le camp noir, immobile, semblait s’anéantir sous l’oppression de la vaste nuit mauvaise, où pesait ce quelque chose d’effroyable, sans nom encore. Des sursauts venaient d’un lac d’ombre, un râle subit sortait d’une tente invisible. Ensuite, c’étaient des bruits qu’on ne reconnaissait pas, l’ébrouement d’un cheval, le choc d’un sabre, la fuite d’un rôdeur attardé, toutes les ordinaires rumeurs qui prenaient des retentissements de menace. Mais, tout à coup, près des cantines, une grande lueur éclata. Le front de bandière en était vivement éclairé, on aperçut les faisceaux alignés, les canons des fusils réguliers et clairs, où filaient des reflets rouges, pareils à des coulures fraîches de sang ; et les sentinelles, sombres et droites, apparurent dans ce brusque incendie. Était-ce donc l’ennemi, que les chefs annonçaient depuis deux jours, et que l’on était venu chercher de Belfort à Mulhouse ? Puis, au milieu d’un grand pétillement d’étincelles, la flamme s’éteignit. Ce n’était que le tas de bois vert, si longtemps tracassé par Lapoulle, qui, après avoir couvé pendant des heures, venait de flamber comme un feu de paille.","Hours must have passed, the whole black camp, motionless, seemed to be annihilated under the oppression of the vast evil night, in which weighed this terrible, yet nameless something. Starts came from a lake of shadow, a sudden death rattle came from an invisible tent. Then there were noises you didn't recognize, the snort of a horse, the clash of a sword, the flight of a belated prowler, all the ordinary rumors that took on the echoes of a threat. But suddenly, near the canteens, a great light broke out. The bandeau's forehead was brightly lit up; one could see the aligned beams, the barrels of the rifles regular and clear, from which spun red reflections, like fresh drippings of blood; and the sentinels, dark and erect, appeared in this sudden fire. Was it then the enemy, whom the leaders had been announcing for two days, and whom they had come to look for from Belfort to Mulhouse? Then, amidst a great crackle of sparks, the flame went out. It was only the heap of green wood, so long tormented by Lapoulle, which, after smoldering for hours, had just blazed like a straw fire.","Hours must have passed, and the whole black, motionless camp seemed crushed beneath the pressure of this limitless, evil darkness laden with something horrible but as yet nameless. Little stirrings could be felt in a lake of blackness, a sudden snore would come from some invisible tent. Or again sounds you didn’t recognize – a snorting horse, a sabre rattling, the movement of some late prowler – all quite ordinary noises which took on menacing overtones. Then all of a sudden, near the cookhouse, a great light flared up. It threw the battle front into strong relief in which you caught a glimpse of rows of stacked arms, polished rifle-barrels over which red reflections passed like trickles of fresh blood, and the dark, stiff figures of sentries loomed up in this sudden fire. Was this the enemy whom the officers had been promising for two days and they had been searching for all the way from Belfort to Mulhouse? Then the flame went out in a great fountain of sparks. It was only the heap of green sticks that Lapoulle had worried at for so long, and which after hours of smouldering had flared up like straw.","Two hours passed, and all the camp lay lifeless, motionless under the oppression of the deep, weird darkness , that was instinct with some dreadful horror as yet without a name. Out of the sea of blackness came stifled sighs and moans; from an invisible tent was heard something that sounded like the groan of a dying man, the fitful dream of some tired soldier. Then there were other sounds that to the strained ear lost their familiarity and became menaces of approaching evil; the neighing of a charger, the clank of a sword, the hurrying steps of some belated prowler. And all at once, off toward the canteens, a great light flamed up. The entire front was brilliantly illuminated; the long, regularly aligned array of stacks stood out against the darkness, and the ruddy blaze, reflected from the burnished barrels of the rifles, assumed the hue of new-shed blood; the erect, stern figures of the sentries became visible in the fiery glow. Could it be the enemy, whose presence the leaders had been talking of for the past two days, and on whose trail they had come out from Belfort to Mulhausen? Then a shower of sparks rose high in the air and the conflagration subsided. It was only the pile of green wood that had been so long the object of Loubet's and Lapoulle's care, and which, after having smoldered for many hours, had at last flashed up like a fire of straw."
"Il l’avait saisi par son bras valide, il le soutint, l’aida à franchir le bout de la rue du Bac, au milieu des maisons qui flambaient maintenant de haut en bas, comme des torches démesurées. Une pluie de tisons ardents tombait sur eux, la chaleur était si intense, que tout le poil de leur face grillait. Puis, quand ils débouchèrent sur le quai, ils restèrent comme aveuglés un instant, sous l’effrayante clarté des incendies, brûlant en gerbes immenses, aux deux bords de la Seine.","He had seized him by his good arm, he supported him, helped him to cross the end of the rue du Bac, in the midst of the houses which were now blazing from top to bottom, like oversized torches. A rain of burning embers fell on them, the heat was so intense that all the hair on their faces was roasting. Then, when they came out onto the quay, they remained as if blinded for a moment, under the frightful light of the fires, burning in immense sheaves, on the two banks of the Seine.","He took him by the good arm, supported him and helped him along the end bit of the rue du Bac, between houses in flames from top to bottom like huge torches. Bits of blazing wood rained down on them and the heat was so intense that it singed all the hair on their faces. When they came out on to the embankment they were momentarily blinded by the dreadful light from fires burning in huge sheaves of flame on both sides of the Seine.","Taking his unhurt arm he sustained him for the short distance they had to traverse along the Rue du Bac, where the tall houses on either hand were now ablaze from cellar to garret, like huge torches. The burning cinders fell on them in showers, the heat was so intense that the hair on their head and face was singed, and when they came out on the quai they stood for a moment dazed and blinded by the terrific light of the conflagrations, rearing their tall crests heavenward, on either side the Seine."
"– Ah ! non, elle est trop drôle ! bégayait Loubet, la bouche pleine, en agitant sa cuiller. Comment ! c’est là l’ennemi qu’on nous menait combattre ? Il n’y avait personne !… Douze lieues en avant, douze lieues en arrière, et pas un chat devant nous ! Tout ça pour rien, pour le plaisir d’avoir eu peur !","– Ah! no, she's too funny! stammered Loubet, his mouth full, shaking his spoon. How ! is this the enemy we were led to fight? There was no one!... Twelve leagues ahead, twelve leagues behind, and not a cat in front of us! All for nothing, for the pleasure of being scared!","‘No, really, it’s beyond a joke!’ spluttered Loubet with his mouth full, waving his spoon. ‘ What! Is that the enemy we were marched against? Nobody there!… Twelve leagues forwards, twelve leagues backwards, and not even a cat to be seen! All that for nothing, just for the fun of getting the wind up!’","“Ah! it is too ridiculous too talk about!” sputtered Loubet, not stopping to empty his mouth, brandishing his spoon. “They take us out to fight the enemy, and there's not a soul to fight with! Twelve leagues there and twelve leagues back, and not so much as a mouse in front of us! All that for nothing, just for the fun of being scared to death!”"
"– Écoutez bien, monsieur… Si les Prussiens osent venir, nous les reconduirons chez eux à coups de pied dans le cul… Vous entendez, à coups de pied dans le cul, jusqu’à Berlin !","“Listen well, sir… If the Prussians dare to come, we will drive them home with a kick in the ass… You hear, with a kick in the ass, as far as Berlin!","‘Just you listen, Mister… If the Prussians dare to come here we’ll send them back home with kicks up the arse. You understand, kicks up the arse all the way to Berlin!’","“Listen to what I tell you, sir. If the Prussians dare to show their faces here, we will kick them home again. You hear me? we will kick them from here to Berlin.”"
"Alors, lui-même reconnut madame Combette, la femme du pharmacien, dont la boutique était sur la place. Comme il lui expliquait qu’il allait demander un lit à la bonne madame Desroches, elle l’entraîna, agitée.","Then he himself recognized Madame Combette, the pharmacist's wife, whose shop was on the square. As he was explaining to her that he was going to ask the good Madame Desroches for a bed, she dragged him away, agitated.","Then he recognized Madame Combette, the chemist’s wife on the square. As he was telling her that he was going to beg for a bed for the night from that nice Madame Desroches, she pulled him away, obviously disturbed.","And thereon he recognized Madame Combette, the wife of the druggist, whose shop was on the market-place. As he was trying to explain to her that he was going to ask good Madame Desvallieres to give him a bed for the night she excitedly hurried him away."
"– Mon colonel, s’écria le capitaine Beaudoin, sans attendre l’avis de son chef, il faut fusiller une demi-douzaine de ces bandits.","“Colonel,” exclaimed Captain Beaudoin, “without waiting for his chief's advice, we must shoot half a dozen of these bandits.","‘Sir,’ said Captain Beaudoin, without waiting for his commanding officer’s opinion, ‘we must shoot half a dozen of these thugs.’","“Colonel,” exclaimed Captain Beaudoin, in his incisive voice, not waiting for his superior to give an opinion, “it will best to shoot half a dozen of those wretches.”"
"C’était à Douzy que devait avoir lieu la grande halte, pour permettre aux hommes de déjeuner. On n’y arriva point sans souffrance. Très vite, les prisonniers se fatiguaient, épuisés par leur jeûne. Ceux qui, la veille, s’étaient gorgés de nourriture, avaient des vertiges, alourdis, les jambes cassées ; car cette gloutonnerie, loin de réparer leurs forces perdues, n’avait fait que les affaiblir davantage. Aussi, lorsqu’on s’arrêta dans un pré, à gauche du village, les malheureux se laissèrent-ils tomber sur l’herbe, sans courage pour manger. Le vin manquait, des femmes charitables qui voulurent s’approcher avec des bouteilles, furent chassées par les sentinelles. Une d’elles, prise de peur, tomba, se démit le pied ; et il y eut des cris, des larmes, toute une scène révoltante, pendant que les Prussiens, qui avaient confisqué les bouteilles, les buvaient. Cette tendresse pitoyable des paysans pour les pauvres soldats emmenés en captivité, se manifestait ainsi à chaque pas, tandis qu’on les disait d’une rudesse farouche envers les généraux. À Douzy même, quelques jours auparavant, les habitants avaient hué un convoi de généraux qui se rendaient, sur parole, à Pont-à-Mousson. Les routes n’étaient pas sûres pour les officiers : des hommes en blouse, des soldats évadés, des déserteurs peut-être, sautaient sur eux avec des fourches, voulaient les massacrer, ainsi que des lâches et des vendus, dans cette légende de la trahison, qui, vingt ans plus tard, devait encore vouer à l’exécration de ces campagnes tous les chefs ayant porté l’épaulette.","It was at Douzy that the big halt was to take place, to allow the men to have lunch. We did not get there without suffering. Very quickly, the prisoners grew tired, exhausted from their fast. Those who, the day before, had gorged themselves with food, felt dizzy, weighed down, their legs broken; for this gluttony, far from repairing their lost strength, had only weakened them more. Also, when we stopped in a meadow, to the left of the village, the unfortunates let themselves fall on the grass, without courage to eat. The wine was short, charitable women who wanted to approach with bottles, were chased away by the sentries. One of them, seized with fright, fell, dislocated her foot; and there were cries, tears, a whole revolting scene, while the Prussians, who had confiscated the bottles, drank them. This pitiful tenderness of the peasants for the poor soldiers led off into captivity was thus manifested at every step, while they were said to be fiercely rude towards the generals. In Douzy itself, a few days before, the inhabitants had booed a convoy of generals who were going, on parole, to Pont-à-Mousson. The roads were not safe for the officers: men in overalls, escaped soldiers, deserters perhaps, jumped on them with pitchforks, wanted to massacre them, like cowards and sellouts, in this legend of the treason, which, twenty years later, was still to devote to the execration of these campaigns all the leaders who wore the epaulette.","The halt for lunch was to be at Douzy. They did not reach there without considerable suffering because the prisoners tired very quickly in their half-starved condition. Even the ones who had blown themselves out with food the day before were giddy, liverish and tired; for, far from restoring their lost strength, this gluttony had weakened them still more. And so when they stopped in a meadow to the left of the village the poor devils dropped on the grass, too dispirited to eat. There was no wine, and kind women who had tried to come with bottles were chased away by the guards. One of them fell and twisted her ankle, and there were cries and tears and a harrowing scene while the Prussians, who had confiscated the bottles, drank them. This pity and kindness of the countryfolk towards the wretched soldiers who were being taken away into captivity was manifest at every step, but it was said that they treated the generals with surly rudeness. Here in Douzy only a day or two earlier the inhabitants had booed a party of generals going on parole to Pont-à-Mousson. The highways were not safe for officers – men in overalls, escaped soldiers, possibly deserters, went for them with pitchforks and tried to kill them as if they were cowards and traitors, and this legend of the betrayal was still, twenty years later, to condemn all officers who had worn epaulettes to the execration of this part of the country.","The column was to halt at Douzy to give the men an opportunity to eat breakfast. It was not without much suffering that they reached that place; already the prisoners' strength was giving out, exhausted as they were by their ten days of fasting. Those who the day before had availed of the abundant supplies to gorge themselves were seized with vertigo, their enfeebled legs refused to support their weight, and their gluttony, far from restoring their lost strength, was a further source of weakness to them. The consequence was that, when the train was halted in a meadow to the left of the village, these poor creatures flung themselves upon the ground with no desire to eat. Wine was wanting; some charitable women who came, bringing a few bottles, were driven off by the sentries. One of them in her affright fell and sprained her ankle, and there ensued a painful scene of tears and hysterics, during which the Prussians confiscated the bottles and drank their contents amid jeers and insulting laughter. This tender compassion of the peasants for the poor soldiers who were being led away into captivity was manifested constantly along the route, while it was said the harshness they displayed toward the generals amounted almost to cruelty. At that same Douzy, only a few days previously, the villagers had hooted and reviled a number of paroled officers who were on their way to Pont-a-Mousson. The roads were not safe for general officers; men wearing the blouse—escaped soldiers, or deserters, it may be—fell on them with pitch-forks and endeavored to take their life as traitors, credulously pinning their faith to that legend of bargain and sale which, even twenty years later, was to continue to shed its opprobrium upon those leaders who had commanded armies in that campaign."
"– Je vous confie encore mon frère… Oui, il m’a conté combien vous avez été gentil pour lui, et je vous aime beaucoup.","– I still entrust my brother to you… Yes, he told me how kind you were to him, and I love you very much.","‘I am putting my brother in your charge again. Yes, he has told me how good you have been to him and I love you for it!’","“I intrust my brother to your care once more. He has told me of your kindness to him, and I love you for it.”"
"Lui, depuis le matin, battait Sedan et les environs. Il venait seulement de rentrer, désolé de l’inaction des troupes, de cette journée du 31, si précieuse, perdue dans une attente inexplicable. Une seule excuse était possible, la fatigue extrême des hommes, leur besoin absolu de repos ; et encore ne comprenait-il pas que la retraite n’eût pas continué, après les quelques heures de sommeil nécessaire.","He, since morning, had been beating Sedan and the surrounding area. He had just returned, sorry for the inaction of the troops, for this day of the 31st, so precious, lost in inexplicable waiting. Only one excuse was possible, the extreme fatigue of the men, their absolute need for rest; and even then he did not understand why the retreat had not continued after the few hours of necessary sleep.","He had been wandering round Sedan and its outskirts all day. He had only just come in, disgusted at the inaction of the troops this whole day, the 31st, so valuable and lost in some inexplicable delay. There was only one possible excuse, the extreme fatigue of the men, and even then he didn’t see why the retreat had not continued after the few essential hours of rest.","All that day, from early morning, he had been scouring Sedan and its environs in quest of news, and was just come in, discouraged with the inactivity of the troops and the inexplicable delay that had lost them the whole of that precious day, the 31st. The sole excuse was that the men were worn out and rest was an absolute necessity for them, but granting that, he could not see why the retreat should not have been continued after giving them a few hours of repose."
"Pourtant, un garçon de treize à quatorze ans laissa Prosper l’approcher, et comme celui-ci, en reconnaissant un Français, le couvrait d’injures, ce garçon protesta. Quoi donc ! est-ce qu’on ne pouvait plus gagner sa vie ? Il ramassait les chassepots, on lui donnait cinq sous par chassepot qu’il retrouvait. Le matin, ayant fui de son village, le ventre vide depuis la veille, il s’était laissé embaucher par un entrepreneur luxembourgeois, qui avait traité avec les Prussiens, pour cette récolte des fusils sur le champ de bataille. Ceux-ci, en effet, craignaient que les armes, si elles étaient recueillies par les paysans de la frontière, ne fussent portées en Belgique, pour rentrer de là en France. Et toute une nuée de pauvres diables étaient à la chasse des fusils, cherchant des cinq sous, fouillant les herbes, pareils à ces femmes qui, la taille ployée, vont cueillir des pissenlits dans les prés.","However, a boy of thirteen or fourteen let Prosper approach him, and as the latter, recognizing a Frenchman, heaped insults on him, this boy protested. What ! could we no longer earn a living? He collected the Chassepots, they gave him five sous for each Chassepot he found. In the morning, having fled from his village, his stomach empty since the day before, he had allowed himself to be hired by a Luxembourg contractor, who had dealt with the Prussians, for this collection of rifles on the battlefield. The latter, in fact, feared that the arms, if they were collected by the peasants of the frontier, would be taken to Belgium, to return thence to France. And a whole swarm of poor devils were hunting guns, looking for five sous, digging in the grass, like those women who, with bent waists, go to pick dandelions in the meadows.","But one boy of thirteen or fourteen let Prosper approach, and when Prosper, realizing the boy was French, told him off roundly, he protested. What, couldn’t you earn your own living now? He picked up rifles and was given five sous for each one he found. That morning he had run away from his village, having had nothing to eat since the day before, and he had been taken on by a Luxembourg dealer who had an arrangement with the Prussians about this harvest of guns on the battlefield. The truth of the matter was that the Prussians were afraid that these weapons, if picked up by peasants in this frontier region, might be taken into Belgium and thence get back into France. So there was quite a swarm of poor devils looking for rifles at five sous a time, ratting about in the grass like those women you see bent double picking dandelions in the meadows.","A boy about fourteen or fifteen years old, however, allowed Prosper to approach him, and when the latter, seeing him to be French, rated him soundly, the boy spoke up in his defense. What, was it wrong for a poor fellow to earn his living? He was collecting chassepots, and received five sous for every chassepot he brought in. He had run away from his village that morning, having eaten nothing since the day before, and engaged himself to a contractor from Luxembourg, who had an arrangement with the Prussians by virtue of which he was to gather the muskets from the field of battle, the Germans fearing that should the scattered arms be collected by the peasants of the frontier, they might be conveyed into Belgium and thence find their way back to France. And so it was that there was quite a flock of poor devils hunting for muskets and earning their five sous, rummaging among the herbage, like the women who may be seen in the meadows, bent nearly double, gathering dandelions."
"– Paris brûle… Tenez ! venez par ici, on voit parfaitement.","– Paris is burning… Hold on! come this way, we can see perfectly.","‘Paris is burning… come here and have a look, you can see plainly.’","“Paris is burning. Look! come this way, you can see more clearly.”"
"– Filons de notre côté. J’ai idée qu’il y a du fourbi, là-bas.",- Let's get to our side. I have an idea there's some stuff over there.,‘Let’s bugger off on our own. I’ve an idea there ’s something to scrounge over there.’,"“Come along, and let's see what we can do. I've a notion there's grub to be had over that way.”"
– Mon pauvre petit !,- My poor child!,‘My poor darling!’,"“My poor, poor child!”"
"À sa grande surprise, Maurice vit que le 106e descendait à Reims et recevait l’ordre d’y camper. On n’allait donc pas à Châlons rejoindre l’armée ? Et, lorsque, deux heures plus tard, son régiment eut formé les faisceaux, à une lieue de la ville, du côté de Courcelles, dans la vaste plaine qui s’étend le long du canal de l’Aisne à la Marne, son étonnement grandit encore, en apprenant que toute l’armée de Châlons se repliait depuis le matin et venait bivouaquer en cet endroit. En effet, d’un bout de l’horizon à l’autre, jusqu’à Saint-Thierry et à la Neuvillette, au delà même de la route de Laon, des tentes se dressaient, les feux de quatre corps d’armée flamberaient là le soir. Évidemment, le plan qui avait prévalu était d’aller prendre position sous Paris, pour y attendre les Prussiens. Et il en fut très heureux. N’était-ce pas le plus sage ?","To his great surprise, Maurice saw that the 106th was going down to Reims and was being ordered to camp there. So we weren't going to Châlons to join the army? And when, two hours later, his regiment had formed the fasces, a league from the town, near Courcelles, in the vast plain which extends along the canal from the Aisne to the Marne, his astonishment grows still further, on learning that the whole army of Châlons had been falling back since the morning and had come to bivouac in this place. Indeed, from one end of the horizon to the other, as far as Saint-Thierry and La Neuvillette, even beyond the road to Laon, tents were erected, the fires of four army corps were blazing. there at night. Obviously, the plan that had prevailed was to go and take up a position under Paris, to wait for the Prussians there. And he was very happy about it. Wasn't that the wisest?","VERY much to his surprise Maurice found that the 106th was detraining at Rheims and had orders to camp there. So they weren’t going to join up with the army at Châlons? And two hours later, when his regiment had piled arms a league out of the town on the Courcelles side in the broad plain along the Aisne-Marne canal, his surprise was still greater as he learned that the whole army of Châlons had been falling back since that morning and was coming to camp at the same place. And indeed, as far as the eye could see, as far as Saint-Thierry and La Neuvillette and even beyond the Laon road, tents were going up and the fires of four army corps were blazing by evening. Obviously the plan that had prevailed was to take up a position before Paris and wait for the Prussians. He was very pleased about it. Wasn’t it wiser?","Maurice was greatly surprised when the 106th, leaving the cars at Rheims, received orders to go into camp there. So they were not to go to Chalons, then, and unite with the army there? And when, two hours later, his regiment had stacked muskets a league or so from the city over in the direction of Courcelles, in the broad plain that lies along the canal between the Aisne and Marne, his astonishment was greater still to learn that the entire army of Chalons had been falling back all that morning and was about to bivouac at that place. From one extremity of the horizon to the other, as far as Saint Thierry and Menvillette, even beyond the Laon road, the tents were going up, and when it should be night the fires of four army-corps would be blazing there. It was evident that the plan now was to go and take a position under the walls of Paris and there await the Prussians; and it was fortunate that that plan had received the approbation of the government, for was it not the wisest thing they could do?"
"Lorsque Henriette rentra, elle s’efforça de sourire, malgré le coup qu’elle venait de recevoir en plein cœur. Est-ce qu’elle ne le sauverait pas, est-ce qu’elle n’allait pas empêcher cette affreuse chose, leur éternelle séparation à tous les trois, qui étaient là réunis encore, dans leur ardent souhait de vie ? De la journée, elle n’avait pas quitté cette chambre, une vieille voisine s’était chargée obligeamment de ses commissions. Et elle revint reprendre sa place, près du lit, sur une chaise.","When Henriette returned, she forced herself to smile, in spite of the blow she had just received to the heart. Wouldn't she save him, wouldn't she prevent this dreadful thing, the eternal separation of the three of them, who were there still reunited, in their ardent wish for life? All day she had not left this room, an old neighbor had obligingly taken on her errands. And she returned to resume her place, near the bed, on a chair.","Coming back Henriette forced herself to smile in spite of the blow her heart had received. Would she not save him yet , wasn’t she going to prevent this awful thing, the eternal separation of the three of them who were now still united in their ardent longing for life? She had never left that room all day, and an elderly neighbour had kindly undertaken to do her errands. Now she took her place again on a chair by the bed.","And when she re-entered the room she forced a smile to her lips, notwithstanding the sharp stab with which the doctor's words had pierced her heart, for had she not promised herself to save him? and could she permit him to be snatched from them now that they three were again united, with a prospect of a lifetime of affection and happiness before them? She had not left the room since morning, an old woman who lived on the landing having kindly offered to act as her messenger for the purchase of such things as she required. And she returned and resumed her place upon a chair at her brother's bedside."
"Cette question qui revenait si brusquement, le fit tressaillir, comme si elle éclairait d’une lumière subite un coin obscur de sa mémoire. Il hésita encore, se décida pourtant.","This question, which came up so suddenly, made him start, as if it illumined with a sudden light a dark corner of his memory. He hesitated again, yet made up his mind.","The question, suddenly hitting him again, made him jump, as though it had shone a sudden ray of light into a dark corner of his memory. He hesitated again and then made up his mind.","The question repeated thus abruptly made him start, as if it had suddenly cast a flood of light in upon an obscure corner of his memory. He hesitated for a little, but finally came to a decision and spoke."
"Or, ce soir-là, les officiers du régiment jeûnaient. Par une erreur de direction, le fourgon du cantinier s’était égaré, à la suite du grand convoi sans doute. Si les soldats souffraient, quand les distributions n’avaient pas lieu, ils finissaient le plus souvent par trouver quelque nourriture, ils s’entr’aidaient, les hommes de chaque escouade mettaient en commun leurs ressources ; tandis que l’officier, livré à lui-même, isolé, crevait de faim, sans lutte possible, dès que la cantine faisait défaut.","Now, that evening, the officers of the regiment were fasting. Through an error in direction, the cantinier's van had gone astray, no doubt following the large convoy. If the soldiers suffered, when the distributions did not take place, they generally ended up finding some food, they helped each other, the men of each squad pooled their resources; while the officer, left to himself, isolated, starved to death, without any possible struggle, as soon as the canteen failed.","That evening, as it happened, the officers of the regiment were going hungry. Owing to a mistake in instructions the canteen van had gone astray; probably it had followed the main column. When the men went short because food had not been issued they usually managed to scrounge something to eat, they helped each other and the squads pooled their resources. But the officer, left to himself and isolated, had no alternative but starvation as soon as the canteen went wrong.","The officers of the regiment that evening were a very hungry set of men, for owing to some mistake the canteen wagon was among the missing, gone off to look after the corps train, maybe. If the men were inconvenienced when there was no issue of ration they scarcely ever failed to find something to eat in the end; they helped one another out; the men of the different squads “chipped in” their resources, each contributing his mite, while the officer, with no one to look to save himself, was in a fair way of starving as soon as he had not the canteen to fall back on."
"– Eh bien ! mais, reprit-il, pourquoi ne l’emportez-vous pas ? Je vous installerai à Sedan… Enveloppez-le dans une couverture chaude et venez avec nous.","- Well ! but, replied he, why don't you carry it off? I'll settle you in Sedan… Wrap him in a warm blanket and come with us.","‘Well, yes, but why don’t you carry him away? I will fix you up in Sedan… Wrap him up in a warm blanket and come with us.’","“But why can't you take him with you?” he urged. “I will find quarters for you in Sedan. Wrap him up warmly in a blanket, and come along with us.”"
"Tous les deux donc, Jean et Maurice, s’en allèrent par le chemin que ce dernier avait suivi déjà, le long de la Meuse. Le parc de la Tour à Glaire et la maison d’habitation étaient dévastés, pillés, les pelouses ravinées comme par un orage, les arbres abattus, les bâtiments envahis. Une foule en guenilles, des soldats couverts de boue, les joues creuses, les yeux luisants de fièvre, y campaient en bohémiens, vivaient en loups dans les chambres souillées, n’osant sortir, de peur de perdre leur place pour la nuit. Et, plus loin, sur les pentes, ils traversèrent la cavalerie et l’artillerie, si correctes jusque-là, déchues elles aussi, se désorganisant sous cette torture de la faim, qui affolait les chevaux et jetait les hommes à travers champs, en bandes dévastatrices. À droite, ils virent, devant le moulin, une queue interminable d’artilleurs et de chasseurs d’Afrique défilant avec lenteur : le meunier leur vendait de la farine, deux poignées dans leur mouchoir pour un franc. Mais la crainte de trop attendre les fit passer outre, avec l’espoir de trouver mieux, dans le village d’Iges ; et ce fut une consternation, lorsqu’ils l’eurent visité, nu et morne, pareil à un village d’Algérie, après un passage de sauterelles : plus une miette de vivres, ni pain, ni légumes, ni viande, les misérables maisons comme raclées avec les ongles. On disait que le général Lebrun était descendu chez le maire. Vainement, il s’était efforcé d’organiser un service de bons, payables après la campagne, de façon à faciliter l’approvisionnement des troupes. Il n’y avait plus rien, l’argent devenait inutile. La veille encore, on payait un biscuit deux francs, une bouteille de vin sept francs, un petit verre d’eau-de-vie vingt sous, une pipe de tabac dix sous. Et, maintenant, des officiers devaient garder la maison du général, ainsi que les masures voisines, le sabre au poing, car de continuelles bandes de rôdeurs enfonçaient les portes, volaient jusqu’à l’huile des lampes pour la boire.","The two of them, therefore, Jean and Maurice, set off by the road that the latter had already followed, along the Meuse. The park of the Tour à Glaire and the dwelling house were devastated, looted, the lawns furrowed as if by a storm, the trees felled, the buildings invaded. A crowd in rags, soldiers covered in mud, with sunken cheeks, eyes shining with fever, camped there like gypsies, living like wolves in the soiled rooms, not daring to go out for fear of losing their place for the night. And, farther on, on the slopes, they crossed the cavalry and the artillery, so correct until then, also fallen, disorganized under this torture of hunger, which maddened the horses and threw the men across the fields, in devastating bands. On the right, they saw, in front of the mill, an interminable line of artillerymen and African chasseurs filing by slowly: the miller was selling them flour, two handfuls in their handkerchief for a franc. But the fear of waiting too long made them pass on, with the hope of finding something better, in the village of Iges; and it was a consternation when they visited it, bare and dreary, like a village in Algeria, after a passage of locusts: not a crumb of food left, neither bread, nor vegetables, nor meat, the wretched houses as scraped with fingernails. It was said that General Lebrun had gone down to the mayor's. In vain, he had endeavored to organize a service of vouchers, payable after the campaign, so as to facilitate the provisioning of the troops. There was nothing left, the money was useless. The day before, one paid two francs for a biscuit, seven francs for a bottle of wine, twenty sous for a small glass of brandy, ten sous for a tobacco pipe. And now officers were to guard the general's house, as well as the neighboring hovels, sabers in hand, for continual bands of prowlers broke down the doors, stealing even the oil from the lamps to drink it.","So the two of them took the road Maurice had already been along, by the river. The gardens of La Tour à Glaire and the house had already been laid waste and looted, the lawns ploughed up as though by storm-floods, trees felled, buildings broken into. A bedraggled mob of soldiers, covered with mud, hollow-cheeked and with feverish, shining eyes, were camping out like a lot of gypsies, living like wolves in rooms filthy with excrement, for they dared not go out in case they lost their places for the night. And further on, up the slopes, they went through the cavalry and artillery, formerly so well drilled but now demoralized, too, going to pieces in this torturing hunger which maddened the horses and sent men off over the meadows in marauding bands. On the right they saw an endless queue of artillerymen and Chasseurs d’Afrique slowly moving past a mill where the miller was selling flour, two handfuls of it in their handkerchiefs for a franc. But they were afraid of waiting too long and went on, hoping to find something better in the village of Iges. But when they reached there they were filled with consternation to find it bare and grim like an Algerian village after the locusts have passed, not a scrap left of anything to eat, bread, vegetables or meat, and the miserable houses looked as though people had scratched all through them with their nails. It was said that General Lebrun had put up in the mayor’s house. He had tried in vain to arrange an issue of vouchers payable after the war so as to facilitate the feeding of the troops. There was nothing left, and money was useless. Even the day before one biscuit had fetched two francs, a bottle of wine seven, a little tot of brandy one franc, a pipeful of tobacco fifty centimes. And now officers had to guard the general’s house and the surrounding hovels with drawn swords because continual bands of marauders were breaking down doors and stealing even lamp-oil to drink.","The pair, therefore, Maurice and Jean, started out by the road along the Meuse which the former had traversed once before, on the night of his arrival. At the Tour a Glaire the park and dwelling-house presented a sorrowful spectacle of pillage and devastation, the trim lawns cut up and destroyed, the trees felled, the mansion dismantled. A ragged, dirty crew of soldiers, with hollow cheeks and eyes preternaturally bright from fever, had taken possession of the place and were living like beasts in the filthy chambers, not daring to leave their quarters for a moment lest someone else might come along and occupy them. A little further on they passed the cavalry and artillery, encamped on the hillsides, once so conspicuous by reason of the neatness and jauntiness of their appearance, now run to seed like all the rest, their organization gone, demoralized by that terrible, torturing hunger that drove the horses wild and sent the men straggling through the fields in plundering bands. Below them, to the right, they beheld an apparently interminable line of artillerymen and chasseurs d'Afrique defiling slowly before the mill; the miller was selling them flour, measuring out two handfuls into their handkerchiefs for a franc. The prospect of the long wait that lay before them, should they take their place at the end of the line, determined them to pass on, in the hope that some better opportunity would present itself at the village of Iges; but great was their consternation when they reached it to find the little place as bare and empty as an Algerian village through which has passed a swarm of locusts; not a crumb, not a fragment of anything eatable, neither bread, nor meat, nor vegetables, the wretched inhabitants utterly destitute. General Lebrun was said to be there, closeted with the mayor. He had been endeavoring, ineffectually, to arrange for an issue of bonds, redeemable at the close of the war, in order to facilitate the victualing of the troops. Money had ceased to have any value when there was nothing that it could purchase. The day before two francs had been paid for a biscuit, seven francs for a bottle of wine, a small glass of brandy was twenty sous, a pipeful of tobacco ten sous. And now officers, sword in hand, had to stand guard before the general's house and the neighboring hovels, for bands of marauders were constantly passing, breaking down doors and stealing even the oil from the lamps and drinking it."
"– Vous entendez, mes enfants, à la baïonnette !","“You hear, my children, with the bayonet!","‘You hear, boys, with the bayonet!’","“You hear, my children; give them the bayonet!”"
"Maurice lui-même, raffermi depuis qu’il avait rejoint les camarades, ne souffrit guère que des musiques prussiennes, qui jouèrent toute l’après-midi, de l’autre côté du canal. Vers le soir, il y eut des chœurs. On voyait, au delà du cordon des sentinelles, les soldats se promenant par petits groupes, chantant d’une voix lente et haute, pour célébrer le dimanche.","Maurice himself, strengthened since he had rejoined the comrades, suffered only from the Prussian bands, which played all afternoon on the other side of the canal. Towards evening there were choirs. One could see, beyond the cordon of sentries, the soldiers walking in small groups, singing in a slow and high voice, to celebrate Sunday.","Even Maurice, feeling better now he had rejoined his companions, found nothing much to grumble about except the German bands which played all through the afternoon on the opposite side of the canal. And towards evening there was hymn-singing as well. Beyond the cordon of sentries little groups of soldiers could be seen singing slow and loud to celebrate the Sabbath.","Maurice, whose courage had returned to him now that he was with the comrades once more, found nothing to annoy him except the Prussian bands, which played all the afternoon beyond the canal. Toward evening there was vocal music, and the men sang in chorus. They could be seen outside the chain of sentries, walking to and fro in little groups and singing solemn melodies in a loud, ringing voice in honor of the Sabbath."
"– Pour sûr qu’ils ont pissé dessus ! ajouta Chouteau, en ricanant.","“Sure they pissed on it!” added Chouteau, with a sneer.",‘I expect they’ve pissed on them!’ added Chouteau with a grin.,"“They ought to take them in out of the rain,” sneered Chouteau."
"Et, d’un coup d’épaule, il lança son sac contre un talus. Merci ! Vingt-cinq kilos sur l’échine, il en avait assez ! On n’était pas des bêtes de somme, pour traîner ça.","And, with a shove, he threw his bag against an embankment. Thank you ! Twenty-five kilos on the back, he had enough! We weren't beasts of burden, to drag that around.","And with a jerk of his shoulder he pitched his pack against a bank. No thank you! Twenty-five kilos on his spine, he’d had enough! They weren’t beasts of burden, to have to carry all that.","he exclaimed, and with a quick upward jerk of the shoulder sent his kit rolling down an embankment. Fifty pounds at the end of his backbone, he had had enough of it, thank you! He was no beast of burden to lug that load about."
"Dans le crâne étroit de Rochas, cette idée de trahison n’était pas loin de paraître naturelle, car elle expliquait les défaites qu’il ne pouvait admettre.","In Rochas' narrow head, this idea of betrayal was not far from natural, because it explained the defeats he could not admit.","In Rochas’s limited mind this idea of treason was not far from seeming the obvious thing, for it explained defeats he could not admit to.","The idea of treason did not appear so extremely unnatural to Rochas's thick understanding, for it served to explain those reverses that he could not account for otherwise."
"À cette heure, autour de Sedan, de toutes les positions perdues, de Floing, du plateau d’Illy, du bois de la Garenne, de la vallée de la Givonne, de la route de Bazeilles, un flot épouvanté d’hommes, de chevaux et de canons refluait, roulait vers la ville. Cette place forte, sur laquelle on avait eu l’idée désastreuse de s’appuyer, devenait une tentation funeste, l’abri qui s’offrait aux fuyards, le salut où se laissaient entraîner les plus braves, dans la démoralisation et la panique de tous. Derrière les remparts, là-bas, on s’imaginait qu’on échapperait enfin à cette terrible artillerie, grondant depuis bientôt douze heures ; et il n’y avait plus de conscience, plus de raisonnement, la bête emportait l’homme, c’était la folie de l’instinct galopant, cherchant le trou, pour se terrer et dormir.","At this hour, around Sedan, around all the lost positions, around Floing, the Illy plateau, the Bois de la Garenne, the Givonne valley, the Bazeilles road, a terrified stream of men, horses and cannons flowed back, rolled towards the town. This stronghold, on which we had had the disastrous idea of leaning, became a disastrous temptation, the shelter offered to fugitives, the salvation into which the bravest allowed themselves to be drawn into the demoralization and panic of all. Behind the ramparts, over there, we imagined that we would finally escape this terrible artillery, rumbling for nearly twelve hours; and there was no more conscience, no more reasoning, the beast carried off the man, it was the madness of galloping instinct, looking for the hole, to hide itself and sleep.","Now all round Sedan, from all the lost positions – Floing, the plateau of Illy, the Garenne woods and the valley of the Givonne, the Bazeilles road – a panic-stricken flood of men, horses and cannon was pouring towards the town. This fortress, on which they had had the disastrous idea of depending, was proving to be a terrible snare, a shelter for fugitives, a sanctuary into which even the bravest men let themselves be lured in the general demoralization and panic. Behind those ramparts they imagined they would at last escape from the terrible artillery which had been thundering for nearly twelve hours; all conscience and reason had fled, the animal had run away with the human and there was nothing left but the mad rush of instinct stampeding for the hole in which to go to earth and sleep.","As when the ice breaks up and the great cakes come crashing, grinding down upon the bosom of the swollen stream, carrying away all before them, so now, from every position about Sedan that had been wrested from the French, from Floing and the plateau of Illy, from the wood of la Garenne, the valley of la Givonne and the Bazeilles road, the stampede commenced; a mad torrent of horses, guns, and affrighted men came pouring toward the city. It was a most unfortunate inspiration that brought the army under the walls of that fortified place. There was too much in the way of temptation there; the shelter that it afforded the skulker and the deserter, the assurance of safety that even the bravest beheld behind its ramparts, entailed widespread panic and demoralization. Down there behind those protecting walls, so everyone imagined, was safety from that terrible artillery that had been blazing without intermission for near twelve hours; duty, manhood, reason were all lost sight of; the man disappeared and was succeeded by the brute, and their fierce instinct sent them racing wildly for shelter, seeking a place where they might hide their head and lie down and sleep."
"Ce fut un rude moment. Prosper, qui n’était pas plus poltron qu’un autre, alluma une cigarette, tant il avait la bouche sèche. Quand on va charger, chacun peut se dire : « Cette fois, j’y reste ! » Cela dura bien cinq ou six minutes, on racontait que le général Margueritte était allé en avant, pour reconnaître le terrain. On attendait. Les cinq régiments s’étaient formés en trois colonnes, chaque colonne avait sept escadrons de profondeur, de quoi donner à manger aux canons.","It was a rough moment. Prosper, who was no more cowardly than anyone else, lit a cigarette, his mouth so dry. When we go to load, everyone can say to themselves: “This time, I’m staying there! This lasted a good five or six minutes, it was said that General Margueritte had gone ahead to reconnoitre the ground. We were waiting. The five regiments had formed into three columns, each column seven squadrons deep, enough to feed the guns.","It was a nasty moment. Prosper was no more a coward than the next man, but he lit a cigarette because his mouth was so dry. When you are about to charge, every man can really tell himself: ‘This time I shall stay there!’ This lasted a good five or six minutes, and it was being said that General Margueritte had gone ahead to reconnoitre. They waited. The five regiments were drawn up in three columns, each column seven squadrons deep – plenty of cannon-fodder.","It was a trying moment. Prosper was no more a coward than the next man, but his mouth was intolerably dry and hot; he lit a cigarette in the hope that it would relieve the unpleasant sensation. When about to charge no man can assert with any degree of certainty that he will ride back again. The suspense lasted some five or six minutes; it was said that General Margueritte had ridden forward to reconnoiter the ground over which they were to charge; they were awaiting his return. The five regiments had been formed in three columns, each column having a depth of seven squadrons; enough to afford an ample meal to the hostile guns."
"On était arrivé de Belfort vers cinq heures. Il en était huit, et les hommes venaient seulement de toucher les vivres. Mais le bois devait s’être égaré, la distribution n’avait pu avoir lieu. Impossible d’allumer du feu et de faire la soupe. Il avait fallu se contenter de mâcher à froid le biscuit, qu’on arrosait de grands coups d’eau-de-vie, ce qui achevait de casser les jambes, déjà molles de fatigue. Deux soldats pourtant, en arrière des faisceaux, près de la cantine, s’entêtaient à vouloir enflammer un tas de bois vert, de jeunes troncs d’arbre qu’ils avaient coupés avec leurs sabres-baïonnettes, et qui refusaient obstinément de brûler. Une grosse fumée, noire et lente, montait dans l’air du soir, d’une infinie tristesse.","We had arrived from Belfort around five o'clock. There were eight of them, and the men had only just touched the provisions. But the wood must have gone astray, the distribution could not have taken place. Impossible to light a fire and make the soup. They had to content themselves with chewing the biscuit cold, and drizzling it with brandy, which finished breaking their legs, which were already soft with fatigue. Two soldiers, however, behind the beams, near the canteen, stubbornly wanted to set fire to a heap of green wood, young tree trunks which they had cut with their sabre-bayonets, and which obstinately refused to burn. A big smoke, black and slow, rose in the evening air, of an infinite sadness.","They had reached there from Belfort at about five. It was now eight and the men had only just got the provisions. But the firewood must have been mislaid, for none had been issued. No way of lighting a fire and making some stew. They had had to make do with chewing some biscuit cold, helped down with generous lashings of brandy, which finally put paid to legs already giving way with fatigue. But just behind the piled rifles, near the cookhouse, two soldiers were doggedly trying to ignite a heap of green sticks, trunks of young saplings they had slashed down with their bayonets, and which obstinately refused to catch. Dense smoke was rising black and slow into the evening air, infinitely depressing.","It was about five o'clock when they had come in from Belfort; it was now eight, and the men had only just received their rations. There could be no distribution of wood, however, the wagons having gone astray, and it had therefore been impossible for them to make fires and warm their soup. They had consequently been obliged to content themselves as best they might, washing down their dry hard-tack with copious draughts of brandy, a proceeding that was not calculated greatly to help their tired legs after their long march. Near the canteen, however, behind the stacks of muskets, there were two soldiers pertinaciously endeavoring to elicit a blaze from a small pile of green wood, the trunks of some small trees that they had chopped down with their sword-bayonets, and that were obstinately determined not to burn. The cloud of thick, black smoke, rising slowly in the evening air, added to the general cheerlessness of the scene."
"Mais des plaintes les surprirent, ils poussèrent jusqu’à une petite maison isolée, sur leur gauche, où ils trouvèrent deux blessés, au fond d’une chambre. Les portes étaient grandes ouvertes ; et, depuis deux jours qu’ils grelottaient la fièvre, sans être pansés seulement, ceux-ci n’avaient vu personne, pas une âme. La soif surtout les dévorait, au milieu du ruissellement des averses qui battaient les vitres. Ils ne pouvaient bouger, ils jetèrent tout de suite le cri : « À boire, à boire ! » ce cri d’avidité douloureuse, dont les blessés poursuivent les passants, au moindre bruit de pas qui les tire de leur somnolence.","But complaints surprised them, they pushed on to a small isolated house, on their left, where they found two wounded people, at the back of a room. The doors were wide open; and for the two days that they had been shivering with fever, without even being bandaged, they had seen no one, not a soul. Thirst above all devoured them, in the midst of the streaming showers which beat against the windows. They could not move, they immediately cried out: ""To drink, to drink!"" » this cry of painful greed, with which the wounded pursue the passers-by, at the slightest sound of footsteps which pulls them from their drowsiness.","But then they heard some moaning, and pushed on as far as a lonely cottage to the left, where they found two wounded men in a room. The doors were wide open and for two days they had been shivering in a fever with their wounds not even dressed, and had not seen a living soul. Above all they were tormented by thirst amid all this pouring rain lashing the windows. They could not move and at once cried ‘Water! Water!’ – the cry of agonized longing with which the wounded pursue anybody who passes, at the slightest sound of footsteps that drags them out of their torpor.","But they heard the sound of groans, and hastening to a lonely little house on their left, found there, in one of the bedrooms, two wounded men. All the doors were standing open; the two unfortunates had succeeded in dragging themselves thus far and had thrown themselves on the beds, and for the two days that they had been alternately shivering and burning, their wounds having received no attention, they had seen no one, not a living soul. They were tortured by a consuming thirst, and the beating of the rain against the window-panes added to their torment, but they could not move hand or foot. Hence, when they heard Silvine approaching, the first word that escaped their lips was: “Drink! Give us to drink!” that longing, pathetic cry, with which the wounded always pursue the by-passer whenever the sound of footsteps arouses them from their lethargy."
"– Ne restez pas là !… Vite, vite, cachez-vous dans la maison !","“Don't stay there! Quick, quick, hide in the house!”","‘Don’t stay there! Quick, quick, hide in the house!’","“Madame, don't stay there. Go inside the house, quick, quick!”"
"– Ah ! bon, merci !",– Ah! good thank you !,"‘Oh good, thank you.’",“That is well! Thanks.”
"Il souriait à son tour, il répéta le mot de Weiss.","He smiled in turn, he repeated Weiss's word.",But then he too smiled and took up Weiss’s phrase.,"He smiled and repeated his brother-in-law's expression: “And besides, who can tell?”"
"Le père Fouchard restait consterné. Il aimait tout de même son fils, à sa manière. Des souvenirs anciens durent lui revenir, de très loin, du temps où sa femme vivait, où Honoré allait encore à l’école ; et deux grosses larmes parurent également dans ses yeux rouges, coulèrent le long du cuir tanné de ses joues. Depuis plus de dix ans, il n’avait pas pleuré. Des jurons lui échappaient, il finissait par se fâcher de ce fils qui était à lui, qu’il ne verrait plus jamais pourtant.","Father Fouchard remained in consternation. He still loved his son, in his own way. Old memories must have come back to him, from very far away, of the time when his wife lived, when Honoré was still going to school; and two large tears also appeared in her red eyes, running down the tanned leather of her cheeks. For more than ten years, he had not cried. Swearing escaped him, he ended up getting angry with this son who was his, whom he would never see again.","Old Fouchard was thunderstruck. He really did love his son in his own fashion. Old memories must have come back from long ago when his wife was still alive and Honoré was still going to school, and two big tears formed in his red eyes too and rolled down his brown leathery cheeks. He had not cried for over ten years. He began to mutter oaths, and worked himself up into a rage because his son belonged to him and yet he wouldn’t ever see him again.","Consternation was depicted on old Fouchard's face. Appearances notwithstanding, he did love his son, after a fashion of his own. Memories of the past came back to him, of days long vanished, when his wife was still living and Honore was a boy at school, and two big tears appeared in his small red eyes and trickled down his old leathery cheeks. He had not wept before in more than ten years. In the end he grew angry at the thought of that son who was his and upon whom he was never to set eyes again; he rapped out an oath or two."

War is life which cannot be without death.","‘Oh, what do I matter? There are plenty of others… Perhaps the blood-letting is necessary. War is life, and it cannot exist without death.’","“Oh, as for me, what matters it? There is many another in my condition. It may be that this blood-letting was necessary for us.

"Et c’étaient des détails toujours semblables, les quotidiens tourments de cet enfer. On avait désarticulé une épaule, tranché un pied, procédé à la résection d’un humérus ; mais la gangrène ou l’infection purulente pardonnerait-elle ? Ou bien, on venait encore d’en enterrer un, le plus souvent un Français, parfois un Allemand. Il était rare qu’une journée s’achevât sans qu’une bière furtive, faite à la hâte de quatre planches, sortît de l’ambulance au crépuscule, accompagnée d’un seul infirmier, souvent de la jeune femme elle-même, pour qu’un homme ne fût pas enfoui comme un chien. Dans le petit cimetière de Remilly, on avait ouvert deux tranchées ; et ils dormaient tous côte à côte, les Allemands à gauche, les Français à droite, réconciliés dans la terre.","And these were always similar details, the daily torments of this hell. A shoulder had been disarticulated, a foot severed, a humerus resected; but would gangrene or purulent infection forgive? Or else someone had just been buried, usually a Frenchman, sometimes a German. It was rare for a day to end without a stealthy beer, hastily made from four planks, coming out of the ambulance at dusk, accompanied by a single orderly, often the young woman herself, to that a man was not buried like a dog. In the little Remilly cemetery, two trenches had been opened; and they all slept side by side, the Germans on the left, the French on the right, reconciled in the earth.","Then came the details, always similar, of the daily torments of this hell. They had amputated an arm at the shoulder, or a foot, performed the resection of a humerus, but would gangrene or septicaemia spare the patient? Or again, they had buried one of them, usually a Frenchman, but sometimes a German. Hardly a day passed when some furtive coffin, bodged up quickly out of four pieces of wood, did not leave the hospital at dusk, accompanied by one orderly and often Henriette herself, so that a man should not just be buried like a dog. In the little cemetery of Remilly two trenches had been dug, and they all slept side by side, the Germans on the left and the French on the right, reconciled in the earth.","And her particulars never varied; they were the story of the daily recurring torments of that earthly hell. There had been an amputation at the shoulder-joint, a foot had been taken off, a humerus resected; but would gangrene or purulent contagion be clement and spare the patient? Or else they had been burying some one of their inmates, most frequently a Frenchman, now and then a German. Scarcely a day passed but a coarse coffin, hastily knocked together from four pine boards, left the hospital at the twilight hour, accompanied by a single one of the attendants, often by the young woman herself, that a fellow-creature might not be laid away in his grave like a dog. In the little cemetery at Remilly two trenches had been dug, and there they slumbered, side by side, French to the right, Germans to the left, their enmity forgotten in their narrow bed."
"C’était un homme de Remilly, un simple valet de ferme, qu’il avait connu enfant, lorsqu’il allait passer les vacances chez l’oncle Fouchard. Tombé au sort, il était depuis trois ans en Afrique, lorsque la guerre avait éclaté ; et il avait bon air sous la veste bleu de ciel, le large pantalon rouge à bandes bleues et la ceinture de laine rouge, avec sa longue face sèche, ses membres souples et forts, d’une adresse extraordinaire.","He was a man from Remilly, a simple farm hand, whom he had known as a child, when he went to spend the holidays with Uncle Fouchard. Cast by lot, he had been in Africa for three years when the war broke out; and he looked good under the sky-blue jacket, the wide red trousers with blue stripes, and the red woolen sash, with his long dry face, his supple and strong limbs, of extraordinary dexterity.","He was a man from Remilly, a simple farm-hand he had known when he was a child and used to spend his holidays at Uncle Fouchard’s. He had drawn a call-up and had served in Africa for three years when the war broke out, and he looked well in his sky-blue tunic, wide red trousers with blue stripes and red worsted belt, with his long sallow face and his supple, strong yet wonderfully graceful limbs.","It was a young man of Remilly, a simple farm-laborer, whom he had known as a boy in the days when he used to go and spend his vacations with his uncle Fouchard. He had been drawn, and when the war broke out had been three years in Africa; he cut quite a dashing figure in his sky-blue jacket, his wide red trousers with blue stripes and red woolen belt, with his sun-dried face and strong, sinewy limbs that indicated great strength and activity."
"– Ah ! foutre, oui ! reprit le plus grand, la bouche pleine, ce n’était pas drôle, là-bas !… Faut avoir vu, raconte donc, Coutard.","– Ah! fuck, yes! resumed the taller, with his mouth full, it wasn't funny over there!... Must have seen, tell us, Coutard.","‘Oh fuck it, yes,’ the taller one began again, with his mouth full, ‘it wasn’t at all funny there… You have to have seen it – you tell him, Coutard.’","“Ah! foutre, yes!” continued the taller of the two as he plied his jaws , “it was no laughing matter there!

There cannot be sixty thousand men so close to us, we would know.","‘Sixty thousand men! Hang it all, why not a hundred thousand? … You’re dreaming, my dear fellow. Fear has made you see double. There can’t be sixty thousand men so near us. We should know if there were!’","“Sixty thousand men! Why the devil don't you call it a hundred thousand at once?

"Delaherche se précipita, affolé, pour juger des dégâts. Est-ce qu’on allait lui démolir, lui incendier sa maison, à présent ? Que se passait-il donc ? Puisque l’empereur voulait qu’on cessât, pourquoi avait-on recommencé ?","Delaherche rushed, distraught, to assess the damage. Were they going to tear him down, burn his house down now? So what was going on? Since the Emperor wanted us to stop, why had we started again?","Delaherche rushed off in a frenzy to assess the damage. Were they going to burn down and destroy his house now? What on earth was going on, then? If the Emperor wanted it to stop why had they started again?",Delaherche rushed from the building in consternation to see what damage had been done. Did they mean to burn his house down over his head? What did it all mean? Why did they open fire again when the Emperor had ordered that it should cease?
"Mais Silvine, dont les yeux se dilataient, jeta un cri, eut un brusque geste d’horreur. Les soldats ne bougeaient pas, ils étaient morts. Les deux zouaves, raidis, les mains tordues, n’avaient plus de visage, le nez arraché, les yeux sautés des orbites. Le rire de celui qui se tenait le ventre venait de ce qu’une balle lui avait fendu les lèvres, en lui cassant les dents. Et cela était vraiment atroce, ces misérables qui causaient, dans leurs attitudes cassées de mannequins, les regards vitreux, les bouches ouvertes, tous glacés, immobiles à jamais. S’étaient-ils traînés à cette place, vivants encore, pour mourir ensemble ? Étaient-ce plutôt les Prussiens qui avaient fait la farce de les ramasser, puis de les asseoir en rond, par une moquerie de la vieille gaieté française ?","But Silvine, whose eyes dilated, uttered a cry, made a sudden gesture of horror. The soldiers did not move, they were dead. The two Zouaves, stiffened, their hands twisted, no longer had faces, their noses torn off, their eyes popping out of their sockets. The laughter of the one who held his stomach came from the fact that a bullet had split his lips, breaking his teeth. And it was really atrocious, these wretches who caused, in their broken postures of mannequins, the glazed glances, the open mouths, all frozen, motionless forever. Had they dragged themselves to this place, still alive, to die together? Was it rather the Prussians who had made the joke of picking them up, then seating them in a circle, in a mockery of old French gaiety?","But Silvine’s eyes stared and she screamed with a sudden movement of horror. The soldiers were stock still, they were dead. The two Zouaves were stiff, their hands were twisted and they had no faces left – their noses had been cut off and the eyes were out of their sockets. The grin of the one holding his sides was due to a bullet having split open his lips and broken his teeth. It really was horrifying, these poor creatures chatting there in the angular postures of dummies, with glassy stares and mouths open, all frozen and still for ever. Had they dragged themselves there while still alive so as to die together? Or was it rather that the Prussians had thought it was fun to collect them and sit them in a ring by way of having a laugh at the traditional French sociability?","But Silvine, whose eyes had dilated far beyond their natural size, suddenly uttered an exclamation of horror. The soldiers never moved hand or foot; they were stone dead. The two zouaves were stiff and cold; they both had had the face shot away, the nose was gone, the eyes were torn from their sockets. If there appeared to be a laugh on the face of him who was holding his sides, it was because a bullet had cut a great furrow through the lower portion of his countenance, smashing all his teeth. The spectacle was an unimaginably horrible one, those poor wretches laughing and conversing in their attitude of manikins, with glassy eyes and open mouths, when Death had laid his icy hand on them and they were never more to know the warmth and motion of life. Had they dragged themselves, still living, to that place, so as to die in one another's company? or was it not rather a ghastly prank of the Prussians, who had collected the bodies and placed them in a circle about the table, out of derision for the traditional gayety of the French nation?"

"En effet, Loubet et Chouteau le révoltaient par leur égoïsme sournois, volant ce qu’ils pouvaient, ne partageant jamais avec les camarades ; de même qu’il n’y avait rien à tirer de bon de Lapoulle, la brute, ni de Pache, le cafard.","Indeed, Loubet and Chouteau revolted him by their sly selfishness, stealing what they could, never sharing with their comrades; just as there was nothing good to be gained from Lapoulle, the brute, or from Pache, the cockroach.","As a matter of fact he was disgusted by the sly selfishness of Loubet and Chouteau, who stole everything they could and never shared anything with their mates. Neither was there anything to be got out of Lapoulle, who was a clod, or Pache, who was a worm.","The truth was that Loubet and Chouteau had disgusted him by their trickiness and low selfishness, stealing whatever they could lay hands on and never dividing with their comrades, while no good was to be got out of Lapoulle, the brute, and Pache, the sniveling devotee."

"Un clapotement d’eau venait de se faire entendre. Ils virent Lapoulle, qui s’était décidé à se laisser glisser dans la rivière, après avoir enlevé sa capote, pour qu’elle ne gênât pas ses mouvements ; et la tache de sa chemise faisait une blancheur très visible, au fil du courant mouvant et noir. Il nageait, il remontait doucement, guettant sans doute le point où il pourrait aborder ; tandis que, sur l’autre berge, on distinguait très bien les minces silhouettes des sentinelles immobiles. Déchirant la nuit, il y eut un brusque éclair, un coup de feu qui alla rouler jusqu’aux roches de Montimont. L’eau, simplement, bouillonna, comme sous le choc de deux rames affolées qui l’auraient battue. Et ce fut tout, le corps de Lapoulle, la tache blanche se mit à descendre, abandonnée et molle dans le courant.","A splash of water had just been heard. They saw Lapoulle, who had decided to let himself slide into the river, after taking off his greatcoat, so that it would not hamper his movements; and the stain on his shirt made a very visible whiteness, following the moving black current. He was swimming, he was coming up slowly, no doubt watching for the point where he could land; while, on the other bank, one could clearly distinguish the slender silhouettes of the motionless sentries. Tearing through the night, there was a sudden flash, a shot that rolled to the rocks of Montimont. The water simply bubbled, as if under the shock of two panicked oars that would have beaten it. And that was all, Lapoulle's body, the white spot began to descend, abandoned and limp in the current.","They had heard a splash, and then they saw Lapoulle, who had made up his mind to drop into the river, having thrown off his cape so as to be freer in his movements, and his shirt was clearly visible as a light patch moving on the dark current. He began to swim and slowly went upstream, no doubt looking for a suitable place to land, but on the opposite bank the slender outlines of the motionless sentries could clearly be seen. A sudden flash tore through the darkness and the sound of a shot echoed as far as the rocks of Montimont. The water merely swirled as though a pair of oars were badly churning it up. That was all, and Lapoulle’s body, the white patch, was left to float gently downstream.","A splash was heard coming from the river, and they saw it was Lapoulle, who had finally decided to attempt to escape by the stream, first removing his capote in order that it might not hinder his movements; and his white shirt made a spot of brightness that was distinctly visible upon the dusky bosom of the moving water. He was swimming up-stream with a leisurely movement, doubtless on the lookout for a place where he might land with safety, while on the opposite shore there was no difficulty in discerning the shadowy forms of the sentries, erect and motionless in the semi-obscurity. There came a sudden flash that tore the black veil of night, a report that went with bellowing echoes and spent itself among the rocks of Montimont. The water boiled and bubbled for an instant, as it does under the wild efforts of an unpracticed oarsman. And that was all; Lapoulle's body, the white spot on the dusky stream, floated away, lifeless, upon the tide."
"Il fut si troublé, qu’il se contenta de serrer, lui aussi, cette petite main frêle et solide. Et il retrouvait son impression de l’arrivée, cette Henriette aux cheveux d’avoine mûre, si légère, si riante dans son effacement, qu’elle emplissait l’air, autour d’elle, comme d’une caresse.","He was so disturbed that he contented himself with shaking, too, that little frail and solid hand. And he rediscovered his impression of arrival, that Henriette with the ripe oatmeal hair, so light, so laughing in her self-effacement, that she filled the air around her like a caress.","He was so embarrassed that all he could do was squeeze her strong little hand in return. Once again he felt the impression he had had when they first came, of Henriette with hair like ripe corn and so blithe and gay in her unobtrusive way that she filled the air round her with a kind of caress.","He was too flustered to do more than return the pressure of the small, firm hand. His first impression returned to him again, and he beheld Henriette in the light in which she had first appeared to him, with her bright hair of the hue of ripe golden grain, so alert, so sunny, so unselfish, that her presence seemed to pervade the air like a caress."

And besides, why the hell shouldn’t they have this banquet – a lot of poor sods who had forgotten what poultry tasted like?","Jean made no reply, but his manner showed that he wished to hear nothing more of the matter.

"Mais les Prussiens arrivaient, il s’agissait de ne pas flâner derrière le mur. Déjà, le lieutenant Rochas battait en retraite, avec ses quelques hommes, protégeant le drapeau, que le sous-lieutenant portait toujours sous son bras, roulé autour de la hampe. Lapoulle, très grand, pouvait se hausser, lâchait encore des coups de feu, par-dessus le chaperon ; tandis que Pache avait remis son chassepot en bandoulière, jugeant sans doute que c’était assez, qu’il aurait fallu maintenant manger et dormir. Jean et Maurice, courbés en deux, se hâtèrent de les rejoindre. Ce n’étaient ni les fusils ni les cartouches qui manquaient : il suffisait de se baisser. De nouveau, ils s’armèrent, ayant tout abandonné là-bas, le sac et le reste, quand l’un avait dû charger l’autre sur ses épaules. Le mur s’étendait jusqu’au bois de la Garenne, et la petite bande, se croyant sauvée, se jeta vivement derrière une ferme, puis de là gagna les arbres.","But the Prussians were coming, it was a matter of not loitering behind the wall. Already, Lieutenant Rochas was beating a retreat, with his few men, protecting the flag, which the second lieutenant still carried under his arm, rolled around the pole. Lapoulle, very tall, could raise himself, still fired shots above the hood; while Pache had slung his Chassepot over his shoulder, no doubt judging that that was enough, that he should now have eaten and slept. Jean and Maurice, bent double, hastened to join them. It was neither the rifles nor the cartridges that were missing: it was enough to bend down. Again they armed themselves, having left everything there, the bag and the rest, when one had had to load the other on his shoulders. The wall extended as far as the Bois de la Garenne, and the little band, believing themselves to be saved, threw themselves quickly behind a farmhouse, then from there reached the trees.","But the Prussians were coming, and the vital thing was not to dally behind that wall. Lieutenant Rochas was already retreating with his small band of men protecting the flag, still being carried under the second lieutenant’s arm, rolled round its staff. Lapoulle, being very tall, could raise himself and still fire a few more rounds over the coping, but Pache had slung his rifle over his shoulder, presumably deeming that enough was enough and that now some food and sleep would be desirable. Jean and Maurice, bent double, hurried after them. There was no lack of ammunition or rifles, you only had to stoop down. They rearmed themselves, having left everything over there, kit and all, when one had had to carry the other on his shoulders. The wall ran right along to the Garenne wood, and the little band, thinking it was in safety, darted behind a farm building and from there reached the trees.","But the Prussians were drawing near: it would not answer to loiter behind the wall. Already Lieutenant Rochas, with what few men were left him, was retreating, guarding the flag, which the sous-lieutenant still carried under his arm, rolled around the staff. Lapoulle's great height enabled him to fire an occasional shot at the advancing enemy over the coping of the wall, while Pache had slung his chassepot across his shoulder by the strap, doubtless considering that he had done a fair day's work and it was time to eat and sleep. Maurice and Jean, stooping until they were bent almost double, hastened to rejoin them. There was no scarcity of muskets and ammunition; all they had to do was stoop and pick them up. They equipped themselves afresh, having left everything behind, knapsacks included, when one lugged the other out of danger on his shoulders. The wall extended to the wood of la Garenne, and the little band, believing that now their safety was assured, made a rush for the protection afforded by some farm buildings, whence they readily gained the shelter of the trees."
"– Vite ! murmura Silvine en s’en allant et en le laissant de nouveau dans l’obscurité, il faut que je me dépêche, pour qu’ils aient leurs pains.","- Quick ! murmured Silvine, going away and leaving him again in the dark, I must hurry, so that they have their loaves.","‘Quick!’ said Silvine, running off and leaving him in darkness once again. ‘I must run and give them their loaves.’","“Quick, I must be gone!” said Silvine, hurrying from the room and leaving him again in darkness. “I must make haste and see they get their loaves.”"
– Allonge-toi donc ! et fais le mort !,- Lie down then! and play dead!,‘Just you get down and lie doggo!’,"“Lie down, will you! and make believe dead!”"
"Mais, le dimanche, Jean fut épouvanté. C’était le dernier jour de l’exécrable semaine. Dès le triomphal lever du soleil, par cette limpide et chaude matinée de jour de fête, il sentit passer le frisson de l’agonie suprême. On venait d’apprendre seulement les massacres répétés des otages, l’archevêque, le curé de la Madeleine et d’autres fusillés, le mercredi, à la Roquette, les dominicains d’Arcueil tirés à la course, comme des lièvres, le jeudi, des prêtres encore et des gendarmes au nombre de quarante-sept foudroyés à bout portant, au secteur de la rue Haxo, le vendredi ; et une fureur de représailles s’était rallumée, les troupes exécutaient en masse les derniers prisonniers qu’elles faisaient. Pendant tout ce beau dimanche, les feux de peloton ne cessèrent pas, dans la cour de la caserne Lobau, pleine de râles, de sang et de fumée. À la Roquette, deux cent vingt-sept misérables, ramassés au hasard du coup de filet, furent mitraillés en tas, hachés par les balles. Au Père-Lachaise, bombardé depuis quatre jours, emporté enfin tombe par tombe, on en jeta cent quarante-huit contre un mur, dont le plâtre ruissela de grandes larmes rouges ; et trois d’entre eux, blessés, s’étant échappés, on les reprit, on les acheva. Combien de braves gens pour un gredin, parmi les douze mille malheureux à qui la Commune avait coûté la vie ! L’ordre de cesser les exécutions était, disait-on, venu de Versailles. Mais l’on tuait quand même, Thiers devait rester le légendaire assassin de Paris, dans sa gloire pure de libérateur du territoire ; tandis que le maréchal de Mac-Mahon, le vaincu de Frœschwiller, dont une proclamation couvrait les murs, annonçant la victoire, n’était plus que le vainqueur du Père-Lachaise. Et Paris ensoleillé, endimanché, paraissait en fête, une foule énorme encombrait les rues reconquises, des promeneurs allaient d’un air de flânerie heureuse voir les décombres fumants des incendies, des mères tenant à la main des enfants rieurs, s’arrêtaient, écoutaient un instant avec intérêt les fusillades assourdies de la caserne Lobau.","But, on Sunday, Jean was terrified. It was the last day of the horrible week. As soon as the sun rose triumphantly, on this limpid and warm morning of a feast day, he felt the shiver of supreme agony pass. We had just learned of the repeated massacres of the hostages, the archbishop, the parish priest of the Madeleine and others shot on Wednesday at La Roquette, the Dominicans of Arcueil shot like hares on Thursday. , more priests and forty-seven gendarmes struck down at close range, in the Haxo street sector, on Friday; and a fury of reprisals had rekindled, the troops mass executing the last prisoners they took. Throughout this beautiful Sunday, the platoon fires did not cease, in the courtyard of the Lobau barracks, full of death rattles, blood and smoke. At La Roquette, two hundred and twenty-seven wretches, picked up at random from the net, were machine-gunned in a heap, chopped up by the bullets. At Père-Lachaise, bombarded for four days, finally carried off grave by grave, one hundred and forty-eight were thrown against a wall, the plaster of which streamed great red tears; and three of them, wounded, having escaped, they recaptured them and finished them off. How many brave people for a scoundrel, among the twelve thousand unfortunates whose lives the Commune had cost! The order to stop the executions was said to have come from Versailles. But we killed all the same, Thiers was to remain the legendary assassin of Paris, in his pure glory as the liberator of the territory; while Marshal de Mac-Mahon, the vanquished of Frœschwiller, whose walls were covered with a proclamation announcing victory, was no more than the conqueror of Père-Lachaise. And sunny Paris, in its Sunday best, seemed to be celebrating, an enormous crowd crowded the reclaimed streets, strollers went with an air of happy strolling to see the smoking rubble of the fires, mothers holding laughing children in their hands, stopped, listened for a moment with interest the muted gunfire from the Lobau barracks.","But on Sunday Jean was horrified. It was the last day of that hateful week. As soon as the sun rose in glory on a clear and warm holiday morning he had the eerie sensation that this was to be the final agony. News had only just broken of renewed slaughter of hostages. The archbishop, the parish priest of the Madeleine and others had been shot on the Wednesday at La Roquette, and on Thursday the Dominicans of Arcueil had been picked off on the run like hares, on Friday more priests and forty-seven gendarmes had been shot point blank in the rue Haxo sector, and a fury of reprisals had flared up again, the troops executing en masse their most recent prisoners. All through that lovely Sunday the crackle of the firing-squads had never stopped in the courtyard of the Lobau barracks, which was full of death-cries, blood and smoke. At La Roquette two hundred and twenty-seven wretched creatures, rounded up more or less at random, were machine-gunned in a heap, riddled with bullets. In Père-Lachaise, which had been bombarded for four days and finally captured grave by grave, one hundred and forty-eight were thrown against a wall, and the plaster dripped great red tears. Three of them, who were only wounded and escaping, were recaptured and finished off. Of the twelve thousand poor creatures who had lost their lives through the Commune how many harmless people were there for each rogue! It was said that an order to stop the executions had come from Versailles. But the killing went on just the same. Thiers, for all his pure glory as the liberator of the country, was to go down for ever as the legendary butcher of Paris, while Marshal MacMahon, the defeated soldier of Froeschwiller, whose proclamations of victory covered the walls, was henceforward to be nothing but the conqueror of Père-Lachaise. Paris, in the sunshine, was dressed in her Sunday best and in holiday mood, an enormous crowd thronged the recaptured streets, people out for a walk went like jolly sightseers to have a look at the smoking ruins, mothers holding laughing children by the hand paused for a moment and listened with interest to the distant firing in the Lobau barracks.","But Sunday was to Jean a day of terror. It rounded out and fitly ended that accursed week. With the triumphant rising of the sun on that bright, warm Sabbath morning he shudderingly heard the news that was the culmination of all preceding horrors. It was only at that late day that the public was informed of the murder of the hostages; the archbishop, the cure of the Madeleine and others, shot at la Roquette on Wednesday, the Dominicans of Arcueil coursed like hares on Thursday, more priests and gendarmes, to the number of forty-seven in all, massacred in cold blood in the Rue Haxo on Friday; and a furious cry went up for vengeance, the soldiers bunched the last prisoners they made and shot them in mass. All day long on that magnificent Sunday the volleys of musketry rang out in the courtyard of the Lobau barracks, that were filled with blood and smoke and the groans of the dying. At la Roquette two hundred and twenty-seven miserable wretches, gathered in here and there by the drag-net of the police, were collected in a huddle, and the soldiers fired volley after volley into the mass of human beings until there was no further sign of life. At Pere-Lachaise, which had been shelled continuously for four days and was finally carried by a hand-to-hand conflict among the graves, a hundred and forty-eight of the insurgents were drawn up in line before a wall, and when the firing ceased the stones were weeping great tears of blood; and three of them, despite their wounds, having succeeded in making their escape, they were retaken and despatched. Among the twelve thousand victims of the Commune, who shall say how many innocent people suffered for every malefactor who met his deserts! An order to stop the executions had been issued from Versailles, so it was said, but none the less the slaughter still went on; Thiers, while hailed as the savior of his country, was to bear the stigma of having been the Jack Ketch of Paris, and Marshal MacMahon, the vanquished of Froeschwiller, whose proclamation announcing the triumph of law and order was to be seen on every wall, was to receive the credit of the victory of Pere-Lachaise. And in the pleasant sunshine Paris, attired in holiday garb, appeared to be en fete; the reconquered streets were filled with an enormous crowd; men and women, glad to breathe the air of heaven once more, strolled leisurely from spot to spot to view the smoking ruins; mothers, holding their little children by the hand, stopped for a moment and listened with an air of interest to the deadened crash of musketry from the Lobau barracks."
"Ah ! ces draps blancs, ces draps si ardemment convoités, Jean ne voyait plus qu’eux ! Il ne s’était pas déshabillé, il n’avait pas couché dans un lit depuis six semaines. C’était une gourmandise, une impatience d’enfant, une irrésistible passion, à se glisser dans cette blancheur, dans cette fraîcheur, et à s’y perdre. Dès qu’on l’eut laissé seul, il fut tout de suite pieds nus, en chemise, il se coucha, se contenta, avec un grognement de bête heureuse. Le jour pâle du matin entrait par la haute fenêtre ; et, comme, déjà chaviré dans le sommeil, il rouvrait à demi les yeux, il eut encore une apparition d’Henriette, une Henriette plus indécise, immatérielle, qui rentrait sur la pointe des pieds, pour poser près de lui, sur la table, une carafe et un verre oubliés. Elle sembla rester là quelques secondes, à les regarder tous deux, son frère et lui, avec son tranquille sourire, d’une infinie bonté. Puis, elle se dissipa. Et il dormait dans les draps blancs, anéanti.","Ah! these white sheets, these sheets so ardently coveted, Jean saw only them! He hadn't undressed, he hadn't slept in a bed for six weeks. It was a gluttony, a childish impatience, an irresistible passion, to slip into this whiteness, this freshness, and get lost in it. As soon as they left him alone, he was immediately barefoot, in his shirt, he lay down, contented himself, with the grunt of a happy beast. The pale morning light entered through the high window; and, as, already capsized in sleep, he half-opened his eyes, there was yet another apparition of Henriette, a more indecisive, immaterial Henriette, who returned on tiptoe to lay beside him on the table. , a carafe and a forgotten glass. She seemed to stand there for a few seconds, looking at them both, her brother and him, with her quiet smile of infinite kindness. Then she dissipated. And he slept in the white sheets, devastated.","Oh, those white sheets, sheets so desperately longed for! They were all Jean could see. He had not taken off his clothes properly or slept in a bed for six weeks. It felt like the impatient greed of a child, an irresistible passion to slip into this cool whiteness and lose himself. As soon as they left him alone he stripped down to his shirt and had his feet bare, and went to bed and satisfied this hunger with the grunt of a contented animal. The pale morning light came in through the high window, and as he was sinking into sleep he half opened his eyes and had one more vision of Henriette, an even more vague and disembodied Henriette tiptoeing back to put on a table at his side a carafe and glass she had forgotten. She seemed to pause there a few seconds looking at them both, her brother and him, with her gentle smile, infinitely kind. Then she faded away. And he slept between the white sheets dead to everything.","Ah! those clean, white sheets, so long coveted, so ardently desired; Jean had eyes for naught save them. For six weeks he had not had his clothes off, had not slept in a bed. He was as impatient as a child waiting for some promised treat, or a lover expectant of his mistress's coming; the time seemed long, terribly long to him, until he could plunge into those cool, white depths and lose himself there. Quickly, as soon as he was alone, he removed his shoes and tossed his uniform across a chair, then, with a deep sigh of satisfaction, threw himself on the bed. He opened his eyes a little way for a last look about him before his final plunge into unconsciousness, and in the pale morning light that streamed in through the lofty window beheld a repetition of his former pleasant vision, only fainter, more aerial; a vision of Henriette entering the room on tiptoe, and placing on the table at his side a water-jug and glass that had been forgotten before. She seemed to linger there a moment, looking at the sleeping pair, him and her brother, with her tranquil, ineffably tender smile upon her lips, then faded into air, and he, between his white sheets, was as if he were not."
"– Où se bat-on depuis ce matin, le savez-vous ? demanda Henriette, en tâchant de l’interrompre.","“Where have we been fighting since this morning, do you know? asked Henriette, trying to interrupt her.","‘Where has the fighting been this morning, do you know?’ asked Henriette, trying to cut her short.","“Do you know where the fighting is this morning?” asked Henriette, desiring to check her loquacity."
"D’abord, les soldats s’étaient mis à rire. Elle avait une bonne tête, la vieille folle ! Puis, des mots leur parvinrent, la vieille criait :","First, the soldiers had started laughing. She had a good head, the old madwoman! Then, words reached them, the old woman cried:","At first the soldiers began to laugh. What a face, silly old geezer! But then the words came through as the old woman shouted:","At first the soldiers had laughed. Wasn't she a beauty, the old crazy hag! Then words reached their ears; the old woman was screaming:"
"Les autres s’étant écartés, un maréchal des logis parut, dans la clarté dansante de la chandelle. C’était Honoré, dont la batterie se trouvait à moins de deux cents mètres, et qui, depuis deux heures, luttait contre l’irrésistible envie de venir frapper à cette porte. Il s’était juré de ne jamais en refranchir le seuil, il n’avait pas échangé une seule lettre, depuis quatre ans qu’il était au service, avec ce père qu’il interpellait, d’un ton si bref. Déjà, les soldats maraudeurs causaient vivement, se concertaient. Le fils du vieux et un gradé ! rien à faire, ça tournait mal, valait mieux chercher plus loin ! Et ils filèrent, s’évanouirent dans l’épaisse nuit.","The others having moved aside, a sergeant appeared in the dancing light of the candle. It was Honoré, whose battery was less than two hundred meters away, and who for two hours had been struggling against the irresistible urge to knock at this door. He had sworn to himself never to cross the threshold again, he had not exchanged a single letter, in the four years that he had been in the service, with this father whom he called out to, in such a brief tone. Already the marauding soldiers were chatting briskly, consulting one another. The old man's son and an officer! nothing to do, it turned out badly, it was better to look further! And they spun, vanished into the thick night.","The others drew back and a sergeant appeared in the flickering light from the candle. It was Honoré, whose battery was less than two hundred metres away and who for two hours had been fighting an irresistible urge to come and knock at this door. He had sworn he would never cross the threshold again and in all his four years of service he had never exchanged a single letter with the father he was now addressing so curtly. Already the marauding soldiers were in a huddle, conferring busily. The old boy’s son, and an N.C.O. as well! Nothing doing, it wasn’t so good, they’d better look somewhere else. And off they went, and vanished into the inky darkness.","The others stood aside, and in the flickering light of the candle a man appeared, wearing the chevrons of a quartermaster-sergeant. It was Honore, whose battery was a short two hundred yards from there and who had been struggling for the last two hours against an irresistible longing to come and knock at that door. He had sworn never to set foot in that house again, and in all his four years of army life had not exchanged a single letter with that father whom he now addressed so curtly. The marauders had drawn apart and were conversing excitedly among themselves; what, the old man's son, and a “non-com.”! it wouldn't answer; better go and try their luck elsewhere! So they slunk away and vanished in the darkness."
"– Comment, Beaudoin est ici !… Ah ! le pauvre bougre !",“What! Beaudoin is here! Ah! the poor bastard!,"‘What! Beaudoin here? Oh, poor bugger!’","“What, Beaudoin here! Ah, the poor devil!”"
"Renversé sur le trottoir, il se fit adosser contre la porte, près de la femme qui gisait déjà en travers du seuil. Et sa jeune figure gardait son air énergique et têtu.","Knocked down on the sidewalk, he had his back against the door, near the woman who was already lying across the threshold. And his young face retained its energetic and stubborn air.","Knocked down on the pavement, he had himself put in a sitting posture against the doorway, near the dead woman lying across the step. And his young face kept its keen, steadfast expression.","He caused his men to take him across the sidewalk and place him with his back to the wall, near where the dead woman lay, stretched across her doorstep. His boyish face had lost nothing of its energy and determination."

"– Mon Dieu ! et madame Delaherche ?… Que va-t-il se passer ? Elle ne m’aime guère, elle est capable de tout dire à mon mari.","- My God ! and Madame Delaherche?… What will happen? She doesn't like me much, she can tell my husband everything.",‘Oh God! And Madame Delaherche?… Whatever will happen? She has no love for me and is quite capable of telling my husband everything.’,“Mon Dieu! and Madame Delaherche —how will it all end? She bears me no love; she is capable of telling the whole story to my husband.”
"Le soir, quand Maurice voulut enlever son soulier pour voir son talon qui battait d’une grosse fièvre, il arracha la peau. Le sang jaillit, il eut un cri de douleur. Et, comme Jean se trouvait là, il parut pris d’une grande pitié inquiète.","In the evening, when Maurice wanted to take off his shoe to see his heel, which was beating with a high fever, he tore off the skin. Blood spurted out, he cried out in pain. And, as Jean was there, he seemed seized with great uneasy pity.","That evening when Maurice went to take off his boot to look at his heel which was throbbing and burning hot, he tore away the skin. The blood came and he uttered a cry of pain. Jean was close by and seemed full of anxious sympathy.","When Maurice took off his shoe that evening to have a look at his foot, which was aching and throbbing feverishly, the skin came with it; the blood spurted forth and he uttered a cry of pain. Jean was standing by, and exhibited much pity and concern."
"Mais les chasseurs étaient passés, et il y eut encore un brusque galop, un état-major qui dévalait par le chemin en pente. Cette fois, Jean avait reconnu leur général de brigade, Bourgain-Desfeuilles, le bras agité dans un geste violent. Il avait donc daigné quitter enfin l’hôtel de la Croix d’Or ; et sa mauvaise humeur disait assez son ennui de s’être levé si tôt, dans des conditions d’installation et de nourriture déplorables.","But the hunters had passed, and there was another sudden gallop, a staff rushing down the sloping path. This time, Jean had recognized their brigadier general, Bourgain-Desfeuilles, his arm waving in a violent gesture. He had therefore condescended to leave the Hotel de la Croix d'Or at last; and his bad temper spoke volumes about his boredom at getting up so early, in deplorable living conditions and food.","But by now they had gone, and there was a sound of rapid galloping and a staff officer appeared down the hill. This time it was Jean who recognized General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, waving his arms wildly. So he had at last deigned to leave the Hôtel de la Croix d’Or, and from his bad temper it was clear enough that he was annoyed at having been up so early, to say nothing of deplorable conditions of lodging and food.","Behind the chasseurs, when they had all passed, came a general officer and his staff dashing down the descending road, and Maurice recognized the general of their brigade, Bourgain-Desfeuilles, shouting and gesticulating wildly. He had torn himself reluctantly from his comfortable quarters at the Hotel of the Golden Cross, and it was evident from the horrible temper he was in that the condition of affairs that morning was not satisfactory to him."
"– Ouvrez donc, ouvrez donc, foutue bête !… C’est un espion, je vous dis que c’est un espion !","""Open up, open up, damned beast!

It is a spy, I tell you, a Prussian spy!”"
– Les chevaux ! les chevaux !,- Horses ! horses !,‘The horses! The horses!’,“The horses! the horses!”
"Dans sa poche, il venait de prendre son couteau, un petit couteau dont la lame n’était guère plus longue que le doigt. Et, vautré sur le corps de la bête, un bras passé à son cou, il enfonça cette lame, fouilla dans cette chair vivante, tailla des morceaux jusqu’à ce qu’il eût trouvé et tranché l’artère. D’un bond, il s’était jeté de côté, le sang jaillissait, se dégorgeait comme du canon d’une fontaine, tandis que les pieds s’agitaient et que de grands frissons convulsifs couraient sur la peau. Il fallut près de cinq minutes au cheval pour mourir. Ses grands yeux élargis, pleins d’une épouvante triste, s’étaient fixés sur les hommes hagards qui attendaient qu’il fût mort. Ils se troublèrent et s’éteignirent.","From his pocket he had just taken his knife, a small knife whose blade was hardly longer than his finger. And, sprawled over the beast's body, one arm around its neck, he thrust in this blade, rummaged in this living flesh, cut pieces until he had found and cut the artery. With a leap, he had thrown himself aside, the blood spurting out, disgorging like the barrel of a fountain, while his feet moved and great convulsive shivers ran over his skin. It took nearly five minutes for the horse to die. His large wide eyes, full of sad dread, had fixed themselves on the haggard men who were waiting for him to be dead. They became confused and died out.","He had taken a knife out of his pocket, a little knife with a blade hardly longer than your finger. And sprawling on top of the animal’s body, with one arm round its neck, he buried the blade, digging about in the living flesh, hacking lumps out until he found and severed the artery. He jumped to one side as the blood spurted out like water from a spout, while the feet pawed about and convulsive twitchings ran along the skin. It took nearly five minutes for the horse to die. His great staring eyes, full of grief and terror, were fixed on the grim-faced men waiting for his death. They grew dim and went out.","He took from his pocket a penknife, a small affair of which the blade was scarcely longer than a man's finger, and casting himself prone on the animal's body and passing an arm about its neck, began to hack away at the live flesh, cutting away great morsels, until he found and severed the artery. He leaped quickly to one side; the blood spurted forth in a torrent, as when the plug is removed from a fountain, while the feet stirred feebly and convulsive movements ran along the skin, succeeding one another like waves of the sea. It was near five minutes before the horse was dead. His great eyes, dilated wide and filled with melancholy and affright, were fixed upon the wan-visaged men who stood waiting for him to die; then they grew dim and the light died from out them."

"Ce fut dans le jardin qu’ils firent le partage, devant l’ambulance ; et ils y entrèrent ensuite, en reconnaissant sur la paille, presque à la porte, le tambour de leur compagnie, Bastian, un gros garçon gai, qui avait eu la malchance d’attraper une balle perdue dans l’aine, vers cinq heures, lorsque la bataille était finie. Il agonisait depuis la veille.","It was in the garden that they divided up, in front of the ambulance; and they went in afterwards, recognizing on the straw, almost at the door, the drummer of their company, Bastian, a gay fat boy, who had had the misfortune to catch a stray bullet in the groin, about five o'clock, when the battle was over.

"Henriette l’écoutait, effarée, ne revenant pas de sa surprise.","Henriette listened to him, bewildered, not recovering from her surprise.",Henriette was horrified and could not get over her amazement.,"Henriette listened, the picture of surprise; she could not recover from her amazement."

"Jean était devenu très rouge, sous le flot du sang de colère qui parfois lui montait au visage, dans ses rares coups de passion. Bien qu’il fût serré par ses voisins comme dans un étau vivant, il se leva, avança ses poings tendus et sa face enflammée, d’un air si terrible, que l’autre blêmit.","Jean had turned very red, under the flood of blood of anger which sometimes rose to his face, in his rare outbursts of passion. Although he was squeezed by his neighbors as in a living vice, he rose, put forward his outstretched fists and his inflamed face, with an air so terrible, that the other blanched.","Jean had gone very red, with the blood rushing up to his face as it sometimes did in his rare fits of temper. Although he was pinned by his neighbours in a living vice, he got up and went forward with clenched fists and blazing eyes, and he looked so terrible that the other man cringed.","Jean's face was aflame with the crimson tide that never failed to rush to his cheeks in his infrequent fits of anger. He rose, wedged in though as he was between his neighbors as firmly as in a vise, and his blazing eyes and doubled fists had such a look of business about them that the other quailed."
"– Écoute, je ne puis plus rester. Je t’assure que je vais devenir fou… Ça m’étonne que le corps ait résisté, je ne me porte pas trop mal. Mais la tête déménage, oui ! elle déménage, c’est certain. Si tu me laisses encore un jour dans cet enfer, je suis perdu… Je t’en prie, partons, partons tout de suite !","- Look, I can't stay any longer. I assure you that I'm going to go crazy... I'm surprised that the body resisted, I'm not too bad. But the head moves, yes! She's moving, that's for sure. If you leave me in this hell for one more day, I'm lost... Please, let's go, let's go now!","‘Look, I can’t stand it here any longer. I tell you I shall go mad… I’m surprised how my body has stood up to it.

I am surprised that the physical part of me holds out as it does; my bodily health is not so bad, but the mind is going; yes! it is going , I am certain of it. If you leave me another day in this hell I am lost. I beg you, let us go away, let us start at once!”"
"– Alors, qu’est-ce qu’ils se disaient ?","""So what were they saying to each other?""","‘Well, what were they talking about?’","“And then, what did they say to each other?”"
"– Bref, voilà le serviteur qui installe le pliant, au bout d’un champ de blé, à la corne d’un taillis, et voilà l’empereur qui s’assied… Il restait immobile, affaissé, de l’air d’un petit rentier chauffant ses douleurs au soleil. Il regardait de son œil morne le vaste horizon, en bas la Meuse coulant dans la vallée, en face les coteaux boisés dont les sommets se perdent au loin, les cimes des bois de Dieulet à gauche, le mamelon verdoyant de Sommauthe à droite… Des aides de camp, des officiers supérieurs l’entouraient, et un colonel de dragons, qui m’avait déjà demandé des renseignements sur le pays, venait de me faire signe de ne pas m’éloigner, lorsque, tout d’un coup…","– Anyway, here is the servant setting up the folding chair, at the end of a wheat field, at the edge of a copse, and here is the Emperor sitting down… He remained motionless, slumped, looking like a a little annuitant warming his pains in the sun. With his gloomy eyes he gazed at the vast horizon, below the Meuse flowing in the valley, opposite the wooded hillsides whose summits are lost in the distance, the peaks of the woods of Dieulet on the left, the green hillock of Sommauthe on the right... aides-de-camp, senior officers surrounded him, and a colonel of dragoons, who had already asked me for information about the country, had just made a sign to me not to go away, when, all of a sudden...","‘So, in a word, the servant set up the folding seat on the edge of a cornfield, at the point of a wood, and the Emperor sat down… He stayed there motionless, all huddled up, looking like some old pensioner warming his aches and pains in the sun. He scanned with his dull eyes the vast horizon, the Meuse below him flowing along the valley and opposite him the wooded slopes with summits going away into the distance, the peaks of the Dieulet woods on the left, the green hilltops of Sommauthe on the right… He was surrounded by aides-de-camp and high ranking officers, and a colonel of dragoons who had already asked me for directions had just signed to me not to go away, when suddenly…’","“Well, then, the attendant opened the camp stool and placed it in the shade of a clump of trees at the edge of a field of wheat, and the Emperor sat down on it. Sitting there in a limp, dejected attitude, perfectly still, he looked for all the world like a small shopkeeper taking a sun bath for his rheumatism. His dull eyes wandered over the wide horizon, the Meuse coursing through the valley at his feet, before him the range of wooded heights whose summits recede and are lost in the distance, on the left the waving tree-tops of Dieulet forest, on the right the verdure-clad eminence of Sommanthe."
"– Ah ! c’était certain, ajouta-t-il à voix plus basse. De la grande besogne !","– Ah! it was certain, he added in a lower voice. Big job!","‘Oh, it was bound to come!’ he went on almost in a whisper. ‘ A grand piece of work!’","“Ah, it was sure to come,” he added in a lower voice. “Fine work, my masters!”"
"Et l’enfant finit par s’endormir, le rire aux lèvres. Elle n’avait pas pris la peine de le déshabiller, elle le couvrit chaudement et s’en alla, sans l’enfermer à clef, tellement, d’ordinaire, il dormait d’un gros sommeil.","And the child ends up falling asleep, laughing. She hadn't taken the trouble to undress him, she covered him warmly and went away, without locking him in, so usually he slept soundly.","The child at last dropped off, a laugh still on his lips. She had not bothered to undress him, but covered him up cosily and went away without locking the door because as a rule he slept so soundly.","And finally slumber overtook him, with a happy laugh upon his lips. She had not taken the trouble to undress him; she covered him warmly and left the room, and so soundly was he in the habit of sleeping that she did not even think it necessary to turn the key in the door."

All because his old cow of a mother made him swallow Our Father every Sunday! Why don’t you go and serve Mass , you’re too scared to be with your mates!’",“Look at the sniveling papist!

Be off with you and go serve mass; a man who won't stick with his comrades when they are right is a poor-spirited cur.”
"Cependant, lorsque Henriette eut examiné le bras traversé, les côtes atteintes, elle s’assombrit, ses yeux se troublèrent. Vivement, elle prenait possession de la chambre, parvenait à trouver un peu d’huile, déchirait de vieilles chemises pour en faire des bandes, tandis que Jean descendait chercher une cruche d’eau. Il n’ouvrait plus la bouche, il la regarda laver les blessures, les panser adroitement, incapable de l’aider, anéanti, depuis qu’elle était là. Quand elle eut fini, voyant son inquiétude, il offrit pourtant de se mettre en quête d’un médecin. Mais elle avait toute son intelligence nette : non, non ! pas le premier médecin venu, qui livrerait peut-être son frère ! Il fallait un homme sûr, on pouvait attendre quelques heures. Enfin, comme Jean parlait de s’en aller, pour rejoindre son régiment, il fut entendu que, dès qu’il lui serait possible de s’échapper, il reviendrait, en tâchant de ramener un chirurgien avec lui.","However, when Henriette had examined the crossed arm, the affected ribs, she grew dark, her eyes clouded. Quickly, she took possession of the room, managed to find a little oil, tore old shirts to make strips of them, while Jean went downstairs to fetch a jug of water. He no longer opened his mouth, he watched her wash the wounds, dress them skillfully, unable to help him, devastated, since she had been there. When she had finished, seeing her concern, he nevertheless offered to go in search of a doctor. But she had all her clear intelligence: no, no! not the first doctor to come, who might hand over his brother! We needed a reliable man, we could wait a few hours. Finally, as Jean spoke of going away to rejoin his regiment, it was understood that as soon as it was possible for him to escape, he would return, trying to bring a surgeon back with him.","But when she examined the gashed arm and punctured ribs she went very serious and her eyes looked worried. She quickly took the room over, managed to find a little oil, tore up some old shirts for bandages, while Jean went downstairs for a jug of water. He never opened his mouth, but watched her washing the wounds and skilfully bandaging them, but he was powerless to help her, for since she had been there he had been utterly exhausted. Yet when she had finished and he saw how worried she was he did offer to go and look for a doctor. But she kept all her clearheadedness— oh no, not the first doctor he could find, who might denounce her brother! It must be somebody safe, and they could wait a few hours. Finally when Jean talked of going back to his regiment it was understood that as soon as he could get away he would come back and try to bring a surgeon with him.","However, when Henriette had examined the injured arm and the wound in the side, her face became clouded and a troubled look rose to her eyes. She installed herself as mistress in the room, searching until she found a little oil, tearing up old shirts for bandages, while Jean descended to the lower regions for a pitcher of water. He did not open his mouth, but looked on in silence as she washed and deftly dressed the wounds, incapable of aiding her, seemingly deprived of all power of action by her presence there. When she had concluded her task, however, noticing her alarmed expression, he proposed to her that he should go and secure a doctor, but she was in possession of all her clear intelligence. No, no; she would not have a chance-met doctor, of whom they knew nothing, who, perhaps, would betray her brother to the authorities. They must have a man they could depend on; they could afford to wait a few hours. Finally, when Jean said he must go and report for duty with his company, it was agreed that he should return as soon as he could get away, and try to bring a surgeon with him."
"Les Weiss habitaient rue des Voyards ; mais la maison, qui appartenait à Delaherche, communiquait avec la bâtisse monumentale de la rue Maqua. Cette rue des Voyards était alors une des plus étranglées de Sedan, une ruelle étroite, humide, assombrie par le voisinage du rempart qu’elle longeait. Les toitures des hautes façades se touchaient presque, les allées noires semblaient des bouches de cave, surtout dans le bout où se dressait le grand mur du collège. Cependant, Weiss, logé et chauffé, occupant tout le troisième étage, s’y trouvait à l’aise, à proximité de son bureau, pouvant y descendre en pantoufles, sans sortir. Il était un homme heureux, depuis qu’il avait épousé Henriette, si longtemps désirée, lorsqu’il l’avait connue au Chesne, chez son père, le percepteur, ménagère à six ans, remplaçant la mère morte ; tandis que lui, entré à la Raffinerie générale presque à titre d’homme de peine, se faisait une instruction, s’élevait à l’emploi de comptable, à force de travail. Encore, pour réaliser son rêve, avait-il fallu la mort du père, puis les fautes graves du frère, à Paris, de ce Maurice, dont la sœur jumelle était un peu la servante, à qui elle s’était sacrifiée toute pour en faire un monsieur. Élevée en cendrillon au logis, sachant au plus lire et écrire, elle venait de vendre la maison, les meubles, sans combler le gouffre des folies du jeune homme, lorsque le bon Weiss était accouru offrir ce qu’il possédait, avec ses bras solides, avec son cœur ; et elle avait accepté de l’épouser, touchée aux larmes de son affection, très sage et très réfléchie, pleine d’estime tendre sinon de passion amoureuse. Maintenant, la fortune leur souriait, Delaherche avait parlé d’associer Weiss à sa maison. Ce serait le bonheur, dès que des enfants seraient venus.","The Weiss lived in the rue des Voyards; but the house, which belonged to Delaherche, communicated with the monumental building in the rue Maqua. This rue des Voyards was then one of the narrowest in Sedan, a narrow, damp alley, darkened by the neighborhood of the rampart which it skirted. The roofs of the high facades almost touched each other, the dark alleys looked like cellar openings, especially at the end where the high wall of the college stood. However, Weiss, lodged and heated, occupying the entire third floor, found himself at ease there, near his office, being able to go down there in slippers, without going out. He had been a happy man since he had married Henriette, so long desired, when he had met her at Le Chesne, at her father's, the tax collector, a housekeeper at the age of six, replacing the dead mother; while he, having entered the Refinery General almost as a laborer, was getting an education, rising to the post of accountant, by dint of hard work. Still, to realize her dream, it had taken the death of the father, then the serious faults of the brother, in Paris, of this Maurice, whose twin sister was a bit of a servant, to whom she had sacrificed herself completely for make a gentleman. Brought up like a Cinderella at home, knowing how to read and write, she had just sold the house, the furniture, without filling the abyss of the young man's follies, when the good Weiss had come running to offer what he had, with his strong arms. , with his heart; and she had agreed to marry him, moved to tears by his affection, very wise and very thoughtful, full of tender esteem if not of amorous passion. Now, fortune smiled on them, Delaherche had spoken of associating Weiss with his house. It would be happiness, as soon as children would come.","The Weisses lived in the rue des Voyards, but the house, which belonged to Delaherche, communicated with the huge main building in the rue Maqua. This rue des Voyards was at that time one of the strangest in Sedan, a narrow lane, damp and darkened by the rampart with which it ran parallel. The roofs of the lofty house-fronts almost touched each other and the dark entries were like mouths of caves, especially at the end where the high wall of the school towered. But Weiss, who occupied the whole of the third floor rent free, including heating, was well off, living right by his office to which he could go down in his slippers all under cover. He was a contented man since he had married Henriette, whom he had waited for so long, ever since he had first known her at Le Chêne in the house of her father the tax-collector. She had been a housewife from the age of six, taking her dead mother’s place, while he, having got a job in the General Refinery as a practically unskilled labourer, had educated himself and worked his way up to the position of ledger clerk by hard study. And even then, before he made his dream come true, he had had to wait for the death of the father, and then there had been the terrible follies of the brother in Paris, this Maurice, whose twin sister was a sort of servant to him, and had sacrificed her whole life to make him a gentleman. Brought up as a Cinderella at home, having learned little more than how to read and write, she had sold the house and furniture and still not filled the hole made by the young man ’s extravagances when the kindly Weiss had hastened to offer all he possessed, with his strong arms and his heart. Touched to tears by his affection, and being very sensible, after careful thought she had agreed to marry him, for she was full of tender esteem if not of passionate love. Now fortune was smiling on them, Delaherche had talked of making Weiss a partner in the business. It would be perfect happiness when children came.","The Weiss family lived in the Rue des Voyards, but their house, which was Delaherche's property, communicated with the great structure in the Rue Maqua. The Rue des Voyards was at that time one of the most squalid streets in Sedan, being nothing more than a damp, narrow lane, its normal darkness intensified by the proximity of the ramparts, which ran parallel to it. The roofs of the tall houses almost met, the dark passages were like the mouths of caverns, and more particularly so at that end where rose the high college walls. Weiss, however, with free quarters and free fuel on his third floor, found the location a convenient one on account of its nearness to his office, to which he could descend in slippers without having to go around by the street. His life had been a happy one since his marriage with Henriette, so long the object of his hopes and wishes since first he came to know her at Chene, filling her dead mother's place when only six years old and keeping the house for her father, the tax-collector; while he, entering the big refinery almost on the footing of a laborer, was picking up an education as best he could, and fitting himself for the accountant's position which was the reward of his unremitting toil. And even when he had attained to that measure of success his dream was not to be realized; not until the father had been removed by death, not until the brother at Paris had been guilty of those excesses: that brother Maurice to whom his twin sister had in some sort made herself a servant, to whom she had sacrificed her little all to make him a gentleman—not until then was Henriette to be his wife. She had never been aught more than a little drudge at home; she could barely read and write; she had sold house, furniture, all she had, to pay the young man's debts, when good, kind Weiss came to her with the offer of his savings, together with his heart and his two strong arms; and she had accepted him with grateful tears, bringing him in return for his devotion a steadfast, virtuous affection, replete with tender esteem, if not the stormier ardors of a passionate love. Fortune had smiled on them; Delaherche had spoken of giving Weiss an interest in the business, and when children should come to bless their union their felicity would be complete. “Look out!”"
"Beaucoup de ces jeunes soldats arrivaient de Toulon, de Rochefort ou de Brest, à peine instruits, sans avoir jamais fait le coup de feu ; et, depuis le matin, ils se battaient avec une bravoure, une solidité de vétérans. Eux qui, de Reims à Mouzon, avaient marché si mal, alourdis d’inaccoutumance, se révélaient comme les mieux disciplinés, les plus fraternellement unis d’un lien de devoir et d’abnégation, devant l’ennemi. Les clairons n’avaient eu qu’à sonner, ils retournaient au feu, ils reprenaient l’attaque, malgré leurs cœurs gros de colère. Trois fois, on leur avait promis, pour les soutenir, une division qui ne venait pas. Ils se sentaient abandonnés, sacrifiés. C’était leur vie à tous qu’on leur demandait, en les ramenant ainsi sur Bazeilles, après le leur avoir fait évacuer. Et ils le savaient, et ils donnaient leur vie sans une révolte, serrant les rangs, quittant les arbres qui les protégeaient, pour rentrer sous les obus et les balles.","Many of these young soldiers arrived from Toulon, Rochefort or Brest, barely instructed, without ever having fired; and since morning they had been fighting with the bravery and solidity of veterans. They who, from Reims to Mouzon, had walked so badly, weighed down by inexperience, revealed themselves as the best disciplined, the most fraternally united by a bond of duty and abnegation, in the face of the enemy. The bugles had only to sound, they returned to the fire, they resumed the attack, despite their hearts heavy with anger. Three times they had been promised, to support them, a division which did not come. They felt abandoned, sacrificed. It was the lives of all that were asked of them, thus bringing them back to Bazeilles, after having them evacuated. And they knew it, and they gave their lives without a revolt, closing ranks, leaving the trees which protected them, to return under the shells and the bullets.","Many of these young soldiers had just come from Toulon, Rochefort or Brest, they were almost completely untrained and had never been under fire, yet since first thing they had been fighting as bravely and reliably as veterans. These men who had marched so badly from Rheims to Mouzon, worn out by the unaccustomed strain, were now revealing themselves in the face of the enemy to be the best disciplined and the most fraternally united by a bond of duty and self-sacrifice. The bugles had only to sound and back they went into the firing-line, and they resumed the attack even if their hearts were full of resentment. Three times they had been promised the support of a division which never came. They felt let down, written off as expendable. By sending them back against Bazeilles after making them evacuate it somebody was asking all of them to give up their lives. They were perfectly aware of this, and yet they would give their lives without question, closing their ranks, leaving the protection of the trees, and go back into the shells and bullets.","The regiment was largely composed of raw, half-drilled recruits from Toulon, Brest, and Rochefort, men who had never fired a shot, but all that morning they had fought with a bravery and firmness that would not have disgraced veteran troops. They had not shown much aptitude for marching on the road from Rheims to Mouzon, weighted as they were with their unaccustomed burdens, but when they came to face the enemy their discipline and sense of duty made themselves felt, and notwithstanding the righteous anger that was in their hearts, the bugle had but to sound and they returned to brave the fire and encounter the foe. Three several times they had been promised a division to support them; it never came. They felt that they were deserted, sacrificed; it was the offering of their life that was demanded of them by those who, having first made them evacuate the place, were now sending them back into the fiery furnace of Bazeilles. And they knew it, and they gave their life, freely, without a murmur, closing up their ranks and leaving the shelter of the trees to meet afresh the storm of shell and bullets."

"Les temps se confondaient, cela semblait se passer en dehors de l’histoire, dans un choc effroyable de tous les peuples. Les Anglais, les Autrichiens, les Prussiens, les Russes, défilaient tour à tour et ensemble, au petit bonheur des alliances, sans qu’il fût toujours possible de savoir pourquoi les uns étaient battus plutôt que les autres. Mais, en fin de compte, tous étaient battus, inévitablement battus à l’avance, dans une poussée d’héroïsme et de génie qui balayait les armées comme de la paille. C’était Marengo, la bataille en plaine, avec ses grandes lignes savamment développées, son impeccable retraite en échiquier, par bataillons, silencieux et impassibles sous le feu, la légendaire bataille perdue à trois heures, gagnée à six, où les huit cents grenadiers de la garde consulaire brisèrent l’élan de toute la cavalerie autrichienne, où Desaix arriva pour mourir et pour changer la déroute commençante en une immortelle victoire. C’était Austerlitz, avec son beau soleil de gloire dans la brume d’hiver, Austerlitz débutant par la prise du plateau de Pratzen, se terminant par la terrifiante débâcle des étangs glacés, tout un corps d’armée russe s’effondrant sous la glace, les hommes, les bêtes, dans un affreux craquement, tandis que le dieu Napoléon, qui avait naturellement tout prévu, hâtait le désastre à coups de boulets. C’était Iéna, le tombeau de la puissance prussienne, d’abord des feux de tirailleurs à travers le brouillard d’octobre, l’impatience de Ney qui manque de tout compromettre, puis l’entrée en ligne d’Augereau qui le dégage, le grand choc dont la violence emporte le centre ennemi, enfin la panique, le sauve-qui-peut d’une cavalerie trop vantée, que nos hussards sabrent ainsi que des avoines mûres, semant la vallée romantique d’hommes et de chevaux moissonnés. C’était Eylau, l’abominable Eylau, la plus sanglante, la boucherie entassant les corps hideusement défigurés, Eylau rouge de sang sous sa tempête de neige, avec son morne et héroïque cimetière, Eylau encore tout retentissant de sa foudroyante charge des quatre-vingts escadrons de Murat, qui traversèrent de part en part l’armée russe, jonchant le sol d’une telle épaisseur de cadavres, que Napoléon lui-même en pleura. C’était Friedland, le grand piège effroyable où les Russes de nouveau vinrent tomber comme une bande de moineaux étourdis, le chef-d’œuvre de stratégie de l’empereur qui savait tout et pouvait tout, notre gauche immobile, imperturbable, tandis que Ney, ayant pris la ville, rue par rue, détruisait les ponts, puis notre gauche alors se ruant sur la droite ennemie, la poussant à la rivière, l’écrasant dans cette impasse, une telle besogne de massacre, qu’on tuait encore à dix heures du soir. C’était Wagram, les Autrichiens voulant nous couper du Danube, renforçant toujours leur aile droite pour battre Masséna, qui, blessé, commandait en calèche découverte, et Napoléon, malin et titanique, les laissant faire, et tout d’un coup cent pièces de canon enfonçant d’un feu terrible leur centre dégarni, le rejetant à plus d’une lieue, pendant que la droite, épouvantée de son isolement, lâchant pied devant Masséna redevenu victorieux, emporte le reste de l’armée dans une dévastation de digue rompue. C’était enfin la Moskowa, où le clair soleil d’Austerlitz reparut pour la dernière fois, une terrifiante mêlée d’hommes, la confusion du nombre et du courage entêté, des mamelons enlevés sous l’incessante fusillade, des redoutes prises d’assaut à l’arme blanche, de continuels retours offensifs disputant chaque pouce de terrain, un tel acharnement de bravoure de la garde russe, qu’il fallut pour la victoire les furieuses charges de Murat, le tonnerre de trois cents canons tirant ensemble et la valeur de Ney, le triomphal prince de la journée. Et, quelle que fût la bataille, les drapeaux flottaient avec le même frisson glorieux dans l’air du soir, les mêmes cris de : Vive Napoléon ! retentissaient à l’heure où les feux de bivouac s’allumaient sur les positions conquises, la France était partout chez elle, en conquérante qui promenait ses aigles invincibles d’un bout de l’Europe à l’autre, n’ayant qu’à poser le pied dans les royaumes pour faire rentrer en terre les peuples domptés.","The times were confused, it seemed to happen outside of history, in a terrible clash of all peoples. The English, the Austrians, the Prussians, the Russians, paraded in turn and together, to the hazard of alliances, without it being always possible to know why some were beaten rather than others. But, in the end, all were beaten, inevitably beaten beforehand, in a surge of heroism and genius that swept armies like chaff. It was Marengo, the battle on the plain, with its skilfully developed main lines, its impeccable checkerboard retreat, by battalions, silent and impassive under fire, the legendary battle lost at three o'clock, won at six, where the eight hundred grenadiers of the consular guard broke the momentum of all the Austrian cavalry, where Desaix arrived to die and to change the beginning rout into an immortal victory. It was Austerlitz, with its beautiful sun of glory in the winter mist, Austerlitz beginning with the capture of the Pratzen plateau, ending with the terrifying debacle of the frozen ponds, a whole Russian army corps collapsing under the ice, men, beasts, with a terrible crack, while the god Napoleon, who had naturally foreseen everything, hastened the disaster with cannonballs. It was Jena, the tomb of Prussian power, first rifle fire through the October fog, the impatience of Ney who almost compromised everything, then the entry into line of Augereau who freed him , the great shock whose violence carries the enemy center, finally the panic, the save-the-box of an over-vaunted cavalry, which our hussars saber like ripe oats, sowing the romantic valley of men and horses harvested . It was Eylau, the abominable Eylau, the bloodiest, the butcher's shop piling up the hideously disfigured bodies, Eylau red with blood under its snowstorm, with its gloomy and heroic cemetery, Eylau still resounding with its lightning charge of the four- twenty squadrons of Murat, which crossed the Russian army from side to side, strewing the ground with such a thickness of corpses that Napoleon himself wept. It was Friedland, the great dreadful trap into which the Russians again fell like a flock of stunned sparrows, the masterpiece of strategy of the emperor who knew everything and could do everything, our motionless, imperturbable left, while Ney, having taken the city, street by street, destroyed the bridges, then our left then rushing on the enemy right, pushing it to the river, crushing it in this impasse, such a work of massacre, that we were still killing at ten o'clock in the evening. It was Wagram, the Austrians wanting to cut us off from the Danube, always reinforcing their right wing to beat Masséna, who, wounded, was in command in an uncovered carriage, and Napoleon, clever and titanic, letting them do it, and suddenly a hundred pieces of cannon sinking their bare center with a terrible fire, throwing it back more than a league, while the right, terrified at its isolation, letting go before Masséna, who had become victorious again, carried the rest of the army into a devastation of the dyke. broken. It was finally the Moskowa, where the bright sun of Austerlitz reappeared for the last time, a terrifying melee of men, the confusion of numbers and stubborn courage, nipples removed under the incessant firing, redoubts taken from assault with bladed weapons, continual offensive returns disputing every inch of ground, such relentless bravery of the Russian guard, that victory required the furious charges of Murat, the thunder of three hundred guns firing together and the valor of Ney, the triumphant prince of the day. And, whatever the battle, the flags waved with the same glorious thrill in the evening air, the same cries of: Long live Napoleon! resounded at the time when the bivouac fires were lit on the conquered positions, France was everywhere at home, as a conqueror who paraded her invincible eagles from one end of Europe to the other, having only to set foot in kingdoms to bring subdued peoples back to earth.","Periods ran into each other, and it all seemed to be independent of history in a terrible collision of all the nations. English, Austrians, Prussians, Russians passed by in turn and together, and it was not always possible to know why some were beaten rather than others. But in the end they were all beaten, beaten inevitably in advance, in a surge of heroism and genius that swept armies away like straw. Marengo, the battle of the plain, with its great lines skilfully deployed, its faultless retreat, like a game of chess, by battalions, silent and unruffled under fire; the legendary battle lost at three o’clock, won by six, in which the eight hundred grenadiers of the Consular Guard broke the momentum of the whole Austrian cavalry, in which Desaix came, as he thought, to die but changed an incipient rout into an immortal victory. Austerlitz, with its wonderful sun of victory in the winter mists, Austerlitz, beginning with the capture of the plateau of Pratzen and ending in the terrifying disaster of the frozen lakes, with a whole Russian army corps falling through the ice, men and animals in an appalling crack of doom, while the godlike Napoleon, who of course had foreseen it all, hastened the disaster with a rain of cannon-balls. Jena, the grave of Prussian power, first the sharpshooters firing through the October mists, the impatience of Ney who nearly upset the whole plan, then Augereau coming into line and relieving him, the great collision, with an impact that carried away the enemy’s centre, and finally the panic and headlong flight of their vaunted cavalry which our hussars mowed down like ripe oats, filling the picturesque valley with a harvest of men and horses. Eylau, abominable Eylau, the bloodiest of all, a slaughter piling up heaps of hideously mutilated corpses, Eylau red with blood in a blizzard of snow, with its dismal, heroic graveyard, Eylau, still re-echoing with the thunderous charge of Murat’s eighty squadrons, cutting the Russian army through and through and strewing the ground with such a thick carpet of bodies that even Napoleon wept. And Friedland, the huge, hideous trap into which once again the Russians fell like a flock of silly sparrows, the strategic masterpiece of the Emperor who knew everything and could do it all, our left wing immovable, imperturbable, while Ney, having taken the town street by street, was destroying the bridges; then our left charging the enemy’s right and hurling it into the river, crushing it into this dead-end with such slaughter that the killing was still going on at ten o’clock at night. Wagram, the Austrians out to cut us off from the Danube and constantly reinforcing their right wing to beat Masséna who, though wounded, went on commanding from an open carriage, while Napoleon, crafty Titan, let them get on with it and then suddenly opened a terrible bombardment with a hundred pieces of artillery on their depleted centre, throwing it back over a league whilst the right, appalled at its isolation, gave way before Masséna, the now victorious Masséna, and carried the rest of their army away in the devastation of a broken dam. And finally Borodino, when the bright sun of Austerlitz shone for the last time, a terrifying confusion of men, a turmoil of numbers and obstinate courage, hillocks taken under incessant fire, redoubts carried by storm with naked swords, ceaseless counter-offensives disputing every inch of ground, such fanatical bravery by the Russian guards that victory was only achieved by the furious charges of Murat, the thunder of three hundred cannon firing together and the valour of Ney, whose triumph made him prince of the day. Whatever the battle, the flags floated with the same swirl of glory on the evening air and the same cries of Vive Napoléon re-echoed as the camp fires were lit on conquered positions, everywhere France was at home as a conqueror and carried her invincible eagles from end to end of Europe. She had only to plant her foot on a foreign realm and the defeated peoples were swallowed up in the earth.","But small attention was paid to dates; his story was of the dire shock of conflicting nations, and was not to be hampered by the minute exactitude of the historian. Successively or together English, Austrians, Prussians, Russians appeared upon the scene, according to the then prevailing condition of the ever-changing alliances, and it was not always an easy matter to tell why one nation received a beating in preference to another, but beaten they all were in the end, inevitably beaten from the very commencement, in a whirlwind of genius and heroic daring that swept great armies like chaff from off the earth. There was Marengo, the classic battle of the plain, with the consummate generalship of its broad plan and the faultless retreat of the battalions by squares, silent and impassive under the enemy's terrible fire; the battle, famous in story, lost at three o'clock and won at six, where the eight hundred grenadiers of the Consular Guard withstood the onset of the entire Austrian cavalry, where Desaix arrived to change impending defeat to glorious victory and die. There was Austerlitz, with its sun of glory shining forth from amid the wintry sky, Austerlitz, commencing with the capture of the plateau of Pratzen and ending with the frightful catastrophe on the frozen lake, where an entire Russian corps, men, guns, horses, went crashing through the ice, while Napoleon, who in his divine omniscience had foreseen it all, of course, directed his artillery to play upon the struggling mass. There was Jena, where so many of Prussia's bravest found a grave; at first the red flames of musketry flashing through the October mists, and Ney's impatience, near spoiling all until Augereau comes wheeling into line and saves him; the fierce charge that tore the enemy's center in twain, and finally panic, the headlong rout of their boasted cavalry, whom our hussars mow down like ripened grain, strewing the romantic glen with a harvest of men and horses. And Eylau, cruel Eylau, bloodiest battle of them all, where the maimed corpses cumbered the earth in piles; Eylau, whose new-fallen snow was stained with blood, the burial-place of heroes; Eylau, in whose name reverberates still the thunder of the charge of Murat's eighty squadrons, piercing the Russian lines in every direction, heaping the ground so thick with dead that Napoleon himself could not refrain from tears. Then Friedland, the trap into which the Russians again allowed themselves to be decoyed like a flock of brainless sparrows, the masterpiece of the Emperor's consummate strategy; our left held back as in a leash, motionless, without a sign of life, while Ney was carrying the city, street by street, and destroying the bridges, then the left hurled like a thunderbolt on the enemy's right, driving it into the river and annihilating it in that cul-de-sac; the slaughter so great that at ten o'clock at night the bloody work was not completed, most wonderful of all the successes of the great imperial epic. And Wagram, where it was the aim of the Austrians to cut us off from the Danube; they keep strengthening their left in order to overwhelm Massena, who is wounded and issues his orders from an open carriage, and Napoleon, like a malicious Titan, lets them go on unchecked; then all at once a hundred guns vomit their terrible fire upon their weakened center, driving it backward more than a league, and their left, terror-stricken to find itself unsupported, gives way before the again victorious Massena, sweeping away before it the remainder of the army, as when a broken dike lets loose its torrents upon the fields. And finally the Moskowa, where the bright sun of Austerlitz shone for the last time; where the contending hosts were mingled in confused melee amid deeds of the most desperate daring: mamelons carried under an unceasing fire of musketry, redoubts stormed with the naked steel, every inch of ground fought over again and again; such determined resistance on the part of the Russian Guards that our final victory was only assured by Murat's mad charges, the concentrated fire of our three hundred pieces of artillery, and the valor of Ney, who was the hero of that most obstinate of conflicts. And be the battle what it might, ever our flags floated proudly on the evening air, and as the bivouac fires were lighted on the conquered field out rang the old battle-cry: Vive Napoleon! France, carrying her invincible Eagles from end to end of Europe, seemed everywhere at home, having but to raise her finger to make her will respected by the nations, mistress of a world that in vain conspired to crush her and upon which she set her foot."
"Cette lettre toucha beaucoup Maurice, que son cousin, autrefois, avait pris pour confident. Il leva les yeux, le vit en larmes, l’embrassa fraternellement.","This letter greatly touched Maurice, whom his cousin had once taken as a confidant. He looked up, saw him in tears, kissed him fraternally.","The letter touched Maurice deeply, for his cousin had told him the whole story long ago. He looked up and saw that he was in tears, and he put a brotherly arm round him.","The letter produced a profound impression upon Maurice, to whom his cousin had once imparted the whole story. He raised his eyes and saw that Honore was weeping; he embraced him like a brother."
"Il balbutiait, ne trouvant pas même un remerciement, dans son émotion d’être si fraternellement reçu. D’ailleurs, ses paupières se fermaient, il ne l’apercevait qu’à travers le sommeil invincible dont il était pris, une sorte de brume où elle flottait, vague, détachée de terre. N’était-ce donc qu’une apparition charmante, cette jeune femme secourable, qui lui souriait avec tant de simplicité ? Il lui sembla bien qu’elle touchait sa main, qu’il sentait la sienne, petite et ferme, d’une loyauté de vieil ami.","He stammered, not finding even a word of thanks in his emotion at being so fraternally received. Besides, her eyelids were closing, he could see her only through the invincible sleep in which he was seized, a sort of mist in which she floated, vague, detached from the earth. Was it then only a charming apparition, this helpful young woman, who smiled at him with such simplicity? It seemed to him that she touched his hand, that he felt hers, small and firm, with the loyalty of an old friend.","He made vague sounds and could not even find words to thank her in his emotion at being welcomed just like a brother. In any case his eyes were closing of their own accord and he could only see her through the invincible sleepiness which was overtaking, him like a sort of mist through which she floated like a wraith not touching the ground. Was she only a beguiling vision, this woman who was offering help and smiling at him with such simplicity? He thought she was taking his hand and that he felt hers, small, strong and as reliable as an old friend’s.","He stammered something inarticulately, for his emotion was such that he could find no word of thanks. In addition to that his eyes were closing he beheld her through the irresistible drowsiness that was settling on him as a sea-fog drifts in and settles on the land, in which she seemed floating in a vague, unreal way, as if her feet no longer touched the earth. Could it be that it was all a delightful apparition, that friendly young woman who smiled on him with such sweet simplicity? He fancied for a moment that she had touched his hand and that he had felt the pressure of hers, cool and firm, loyal as the clasp of an old tried friend."
– Vous en êtes bien sûr ? reprit-elle d’une voix étranglée.,– Are you sure? she continued in a strangled voice.,‘Are you sure?’ she gasped.,“Are you quite certain?” she asked in a choking voice. “Dame!
"Éperdue, Henriette se précipita, avec sa petite valise, demanda des renseignements. On se battait depuis deux jours dans Paris, la ligne ferrée était coupée, les Prussiens restaient en observation. Mais elle voulait passer quand même, elle avisa sur le quai le capitaine qui commandait la compagnie occupant la gare, elle courut à lui.","Distraught, Henriette rushed with her little suitcase to ask for information. They had been fighting for two days in Paris, the railway line was cut, the Prussians remained under observation. But she wanted to go all the same, she saw the captain on the platform who was in command of the company occupying the station, she ran to him.","Distracted, Henriette rushed along with her little case, asking for information. Fighting had been going on inside Paris for two days, the railway was cut, and the Prussians were keeping the situation under observation. But still she wanted to get through, and noticing on the platform the officer in command of the company occupying the station, she ran up to him.","Henriette, her little satchel in her hand, rushed distractedly up to the men in quest of information. There had been heavy fighting in Paris for the last two days, they told her, the railway had been destroyed, the Germans were watching the course of events. But she insisted on pursuing her journey at every risk, and catching sight upon the platform of the officer in command of the detachment detailed to guard the station, she hurried up to him."
"Elle dit non d’abord de la tête ; puis, à demi-voix :","She shakes her head no at first; then, in a low voice:",She first shook her head and then whispered:,"She shook her head, then said below her breath:"
"Mais, avant d’aller coucher Charlot, Silvine le menait d’habitude dire bonsoir à Jean, avec qui l’enfant était grand ami. Ce soir-là, comme elle entrait, sa chandelle à la main, elle aperçut le blessé assis sur son séant, les yeux grands ouverts au milieu des ténèbres. Tiens, il ne dormait donc pas ? Ma foi, non ! il rêvassait à toutes sortes de choses, seul dans le silence de cette nuit d’hiver. Et, pendant qu’elle bourrait le poêle de charbon, il joua un instant avec Charlot, qui se roulait sur le lit, ainsi qu’un jeune chat. Il connaissait l’histoire de Silvine, il avait de l’amitié pour cette fille brave et soumise, si éprouvée par le malheur, en deuil du seul homme qu’elle eût aimé, n’ayant gardé d’autre consolation que ce pauvre petit, dont la naissance restait son tourment. Aussi, lorsque, le poêle couvert, elle s’approcha pour le lui reprendre des bras, remarqua-t-il, à ses yeux rouges, qu’elle avait pleuré. Quoi donc ? on venait encore de lui faire du souci ? Mais elle ne voulut pas répondre : plus tard, elle lui dirait ça, si ça en valait la peine. Mon Dieu ! est-ce que l’existence, pour elle, maintenant, n’était pas un continuel chagrin ?","But before going to bed with Charlot, Silvine usually took him to say good evening to Jean, with whom the child was a great friend. That evening, as she came in, her candle in her hand, she saw the wounded man sitting on his bed, his eyes wide open in the midst of the darkness. Wait, so he wasn't sleeping? Well, no! he dreamed of all sorts of things, alone in the silence of that winter night. And, while she was stuffing the stove with coal, he played for a moment with Charlot, who was rolling on the bed, like a young cat. He knew the story of Silvine, he had a friendship for this brave and submissive girl, so tried by misfortune, in mourning for the only man she would have loved, having kept no other consolation than this poor little , whose birth remained his torment. So when, with the stove covered, she approached to take it from his arms, he noticed, by her red eyes, that she had been crying. What ? did we just worry him again? But she didn't want to answer: later, she would tell him that, if it was worth it. My God ! was not existence for her now a continual sorrow?","But before putting Chariot to bed Silvine usually took him to say good night to Jean, with whom the child was great friends. That evening as she went in, holding the candle in her hand, she saw the invalid sitting up in bed, staring into the darkness. So he wasn’t asleep? Oh no, he was turning all sorts of things over in his mind, alone in the silent winter night. While she filled up the stove he played for a minute with Charlot, who rolled on the bed like a kitten. He knew Silvine’s story and he was fond of this brave, quiet girl who had been through so much, mourning the one man she had loved and having only the one consolation left of this poor child, whose birth was her lasting torment. And so, when she had shut down the stove and came over to take the child out of his arms, he noticed that her eyes were red with crying. What, had somebody given her more trouble? But she did not want to tell him – she might later on if there was any point. After all, wasn’t life a continual sorrow for her?","Before putting Charlot to bed it was Silvine's nightly custom to take him in to say good-night to Jean, with whom the youngster was on terms of great friendship. As she entered the room that evening, holding her candle before her, she beheld the convalescent seated upright in bed, his open eyes peering into the obscurity. What, was he not asleep? Faith, no; he had been ruminating on all sorts of subjects in the silence of the winter night; and while she was cramming the stove with coal he frolicked for a moment with Charlot, who rolled and tumbled on the bed like a young kitten. He knew Silvine's story, and had a very kindly feeling for the meek, courageous girl whom misfortune had tried so sorely, mourning the only man she had ever loved, her sole comfort that child of shame whose existence was a daily reproach to her. When she had replaced the lid on the stove, therefore, and came to the bedside to take the boy from his arms, he perceived by her red eyes that she had been weeping. What, had she been having more trouble? But she would not answer his question: some other day she would tell him what it was if it seemed worth the while. Mon Dieu! was not her life one of continual suffering now?"
"Puis, le lendemain, les jours suivants, ce furent les autres étapes abominables : le château de Bellevue, ce riant castel bourgeois, dominant le fleuve, où il coucha, où il pleura, à la suite de son entrevue avec le roi Guillaume ; le cruel départ, Sedan évité par crainte de la colère des vaincus et des affamés, le pont de bateaux que les Prussiens avaient jeté à Iges, le long détour au nord de la ville, les chemins de traverse, les routes écartées de Floing, de Fleigneux, d’Illy, toute cette lamentable fuite en calèche découverte ; et là, sur ce tragique plateau d’Illy, encombré de cadavres, la légendaire rencontre, le misérable empereur, qui, ne pouvant plus même supporter le trot du cheval, s’était affaissé sous la violence de quelque crise, fumant peut-être machinalement son éternelle cigarette, tandis qu’un troupeau de prisonniers, hâves, couverts de sang et de poussière, ramenés de Fleigneux à Sedan, se rangeaient au bord du chemin pour laisser passer la voiture, les premiers silencieux, les autres grondant, les autres peu à peu exaspérés, éclatant en huées, les poings tendus, dans un geste d’insulte et de malédiction. Ensuite, il y eut encore la traversée interminable du champ de bataille, il y eut une lieue de chemins défoncés, parmi les débris, parmi les morts, aux yeux grands ouverts et menaçants, il y eut la campagne nue, les vastes bois muets, la frontière en haut d’une montée, puis la fin de tout qui dévalait au delà, avec la route bordée de sapins, au fond de la vallée étroite.","Then, the next day, the following days, it was the other abominable stages: the castle of Bellevue, that smiling bourgeois castle, dominating the river, where he slept, where he wept, following his interview with King William; the cruel departure, Sedan avoided for fear of the wrath of the vanquished and the starving, the pontoon bridge which the Prussians had thrown at Iges, the long detour to the north of the town, the side roads, the stray roads of Floing, of Fleigneux, d'Illy, all that lamentable flight in an open carriage; and there, on that tragic plateau of Illy, cluttered with corpses, the legendary encounter, the wretched emperor, who, unable even to bear the horse's trot, had collapsed under the violence of some attack, perhaps smoking mechanically his eternal cigarette, while a herd of prisoners, emaciated, covered with blood and dust, brought back from Fleigneux to Sedan, lined up by the side of the road to let the car pass, the first silent, the others growling, the others gradually exasperated, bursting into boos, fists outstretched, in a gesture of insult and curse. Then there was still the interminable crossing of the battlefield, there was a league of rutted roads, among the debris, among the dead, with eyes wide open and threatening, there was the bare countryside, the vast silent woods, the border at the top of a climb, then the end of everything that descended beyond, with the road lined with fir trees, at the bottom of the narrow valley.","Then next day and the days after came the other horrible stages: the Château de Bellevue, that desirable upper-class residence with view over the river, in which he spent the night weeping after his interview with King William; the cruel departure, avoiding Sedan for fear of the anger of the defeated and starving, the bridge of boats the Prussians had thrown across the river at Iges, the long detour round the north of the town, the cross-country roads and byways well away from Floing, Fleigneux and Illy, and all this lamentable flight in an open carriage; and then, on the tragic plateau of Illy, strewn with corpses, the legendary meeting of the miserable Emperor, who could not now even bear the motion of the horse, but had cowered in the pain of an attack, perhaps automatically smoking his eternal cigarette, with a party of prisoners, haggard and covered with blood and dust, being taken from Fleigneux to Sedan, moving to one side of the road to let the carriage pass, some silent but others beginning to grumble, and again others getting more and more exasperated and bursting into booing, with fists shaking in a gesture of insult and cursing. After that came still more endless crossings of the battlefield, a league of bumpy roads among the wreckage and the dead staring with wide open, accusing eyes, the bare countryside, great silent forests, the frontier at the top of a rise; then the end of everything, going down on the other side, the road lined with conifers in a narrow valley.","Then the next day and the days that came after were other wretched stages of that journey; the Chateau of Bellevue, a pretty bourgeois retreat overlooking the river, where he rested that night, where he shed tears after his interview with King William; the sorrowful departure, that most miserable flight in a hired caleche over remote roads to the north of the city, which he avoided, not caring to face the wrath of the vanquished troops and the starving citizens, making a wide circuit over cross-roads by Floing, Fleigneux, and Illy and crossing the stream on a bridge of boats, laid down by the Prussians at Iges; the tragic encounter, the story of which has been so often told, that occurred on the corpse-cumbered plateau of Illy: the miserable Emperor, whose state was such that his horse could not be allowed to trot, had sunk under some more than usually violent attack of his complaint, mechanically smoking, perhaps, his everlasting cigarette, when a band of haggard, dusty, blood-stained prisoners, who were being conducted from Fleigneux to Sedan, were forced to leave the road to let the carriage pass and stood watching it from the ditch; those who were at the head of the line merely eyed him in silence; presently a hoarse, sullen murmur began to make itself heard, and finally, as the caleche proceeded down the line, the men burst out with a storm of yells and cat-calls, shaking their fists and calling down maledictions on the head of him who had been their ruler. After that came the interminable journey across the battlefield, as far as Givonne, amid scenes of havoc and devastation, amid the dead, who lay with staring eyes upturned that seemed to be full of menace; came, too, the bare, dreary fields, the great silent forest, then the frontier, running along the summit of a ridge, marked only by a stone, facing a wooden post that seemed ready to fall, and beyond the soil of Belgium, the end of all, with its road bordered with gloomy hemlocks descending sharply into the narrow valley."
"– Écoute, la frontière est trop loin, et puis, décidément, il faudrait un guide… Tandis que, si nous allions à Remilly, chez l’oncle Fouchard, je serais certain de t’y conduire les yeux fermés, tellement je connais les moindres chemins de traverse… Hein ? c’est une idée, je vais te hisser sur ce cheval, et l’oncle Fouchard nous prendra bien toujours.","– Listen, the border is too far, and then, definitely, you need a guide… Whereas, if we went to Remilly, to Uncle Fouchard's, I would be sure to take you there with your eyes closed, so well do I know the lesser crossroads… Huh? it's an idea, I'm going to hoist you on this horse, and Uncle Fouchard will always take us well.","‘Look here, the frontier is too far away, and besides, we should certainly have to have a guide. But suppose we were to make for Uncle Fouchard’s at Remilly. I could really take you there with my eyes shut, for I know even the little by-roads inside out… Isn’t that an idea? I’m going to lift you up on to this horse, and Uncle Fouchard is sure to take us in.’","“See here, the frontier is too far away; we should never succeed in reaching it without a guide. What do you say to changing our plan and going to Uncle Fouchard's, at Remilly? I am so well acquainted with every inch of the road that I'm sure I could take you there with my eyes bandaged. Don't you think it's a good idea, eh? I'll put you on this horse, and I suppose Uncle Fouchard will grumble, but he'll take us in.”"
"– Tu ne m’aimes donc plus, que tu veux mourir sans moi… Garde-moi, ça les fatiguera, ils nous tueront ensemble.","“So you don’t love me anymore, that you want to die without me… Keep me, that will tire them, they will kill us together.","‘So you don’t love me any more, and want to die without me! Hold on to me and they’ll get tired of it and kill us both together!’","“You love me no longer, then, that you wish to die without me. Hold me, keep me, do not let them take me. They will weary at last, and will kill us together.”"
"– Ah ! que je suis heureuse de te voir !… Il me semble qu’il y a si longtemps, et l’on vieillit si vite, au milieu de ces vilaines histoires !","– Ah! how happy I am to see you!... It seems to me that it has been so long, and one grows old so quickly, in the midst of these ugly stories!","‘Oh I’m so glad to see you! It seems such a long time, and we are getting so old in these horrid times!’","“Ah, how glad I am to see you! It seems an age since we met, and one grows old so fast in the midst of all these horrors!”"
"Du coup, une joie folle fit danser le gamin, qui trouvait ça très farce.","Suddenly, a crazy joy made the kid dance, who found it very funny.","The kid danced about with glee, finding it all a scream.","The little ragamuffin considered that a capital joke, and fairly danced with glee."
"– C’est bien vrai, mon lieutenant, à votre santé et à la santé de tout le monde !","""That's very true, my lieutenant, to your health and to everyone's health!""","‘Quite true, sir, here’s to your health and everybody else ’s.’","“That's right, Lieutenant. Here's to your health, and everybody else's!”"
"– Mon Dieu ! où est-ce donc ?… Demandez, interrogez !","- My God ! where is it?... Ask, ask!","‘Oh God, where is he? Ask them, keep on asking!’","“Mon Dieu! how is it that you are not better informed? Where is the place? Ask the people, question them.”"
"– Cela va bien qu’il gèle, fit remarquer Delaherche. Mais, dès que la neige disparaîtra, il va falloir procéder à des recherches, désinfecter tout ça, autrement nous y resterions tous.","""It's fine that it's freezing,"" remarked Delaherche. But, as soon as the snow disappears, we will have to carry out research, disinfect everything, otherwise we will all stay there.","‘It’s a good thing it is freezing,’ remarked Delaherche. ‘But as soon as the snow has gone we shall have a thorough search and disinfect the whole thing, otherwise we shall all be goners.’","“We shall get along well enough as long as the cold weather lasts,” remarked Delaherche, “but as soon as the snow is off the ground we shall have to go to work in earnest to abate the nuisance; if we don't we shall be wanting graves for ourselves.”"
"– Dites donc, ça devient grave, vous allez rester sur le flanc… Faut soigner ça. Laissez-moi faire.","– Hey, it's getting serious, you're going to stay on the side… You have to take care of that. Let me do it.","‘Look here, this is getting bad, you’ll find yourself laid up… must look after it. Let me have a go.’","“Look here, that is becoming serious; you are going to lie right down and not attempt to move. That foot of yours must be attended to. Let me see it.”"
– À la soupe !,- To the soup!,‘Supper-time!’,“Come to supper!”

"– Ainsi, tel est bien votre arrêt à tous les deux… La mort ?","– So, such is your sentence both of you… Death?",‘So this is the sentence you both pass – death?’,"“This you both declare to be your verdict, then—death?”"
Jean eut un cri de joie.,Jean gave a cry of joy.,Jean shouted for joy:,Jean uttered a cry of pleasure.

"– Ah ! foutu sort ! conclut Picot, ce qu’il a fallu jouer des jambes !… Et nous qu’on avait laissés à l’hôpital !","– Ah! damn fate! concludes Picot, what it took to play with the legs! … And we who had been left in the hospital!","‘Oh, what a bloody balls-up!’ was Picot’s conclusion. ‘How we had to use our legs!… And us left behind in hospital!’","“Ah, the cursed luck!” said Picot in conclusion; “how we had to ply our legs! And we who should by rights have been in hospital!”"
"Brusquement, un coup de feu réveilla l’escouade. La nuit était encore profonde, il pouvait être trois heures. Tous furent sur pied, l’alerte gagna de proche en proche, on crut à une attaque de l’ennemi. Et ce n’était que Loubet, qui, ne dormant plus, avait eu l’idée de s’enfoncer dans le bois de chênes, où il devait y avoir du lapin : quelle noce, si, dès le petit jour, il rapportait une paire de lapins aux camarades ! Mais, comme il cherchait un bon poste d’affût, il entendit des hommes venir à lui, causant, cassant les branches, et il s’effara, il lâcha son coup de feu, croyant avoir affaire à des Prussiens.","Suddenly, a shot woke the squad. The night was still deep, it could be three o'clock. All were on their feet, the alert grew closer and closer, it was believed to be an enemy attack. And it was only Loubet, who, no longer sleeping, had had the idea of sinking into the oak woods, where there must be rabbits: what a wedding, if, at daybreak, he brought back a pair of bunnies to comrades! But, as he was looking for a good lookout post, he heard men coming towards him, talking, breaking the branches, and he took fright, he let go of his shot, thinking he was dealing with Prussians.","A sudden shot woke up the squad. It was still pitch dark, it might be about three. They all leaped to their feet, the alert ran along the lines and it was believed to be an enemy attack. But it was only Loubet, who couldn’t sleep any more and so had thought of going into the oak wood where there might be rabbits. What a binge they would have if he brought back a pair of rabbits for his mates at dawn! But as he was looking for a good place to shoot from he heard some men coming towards him, snapping twigs and talking, and he panicked and fired his shot, thinking he had got some Prussians to deal with.","Suddenly a shot rang out in the darkness and aroused the sleepers. It was about three o'clock, and the obscurity was profound. Immediately everyone was on foot, the alarm spread through the camp; it was supposed the Prussians were attacking. It was only Loubet who, unable to sleep longer, had taken it in his head to make a foray into the oak-wood, which he thought gave promise of rabbits: what a jolly good lark it would be if he could bring in a pair of nice rabbits for the comrades' breakfast! But as he was looking about for a favorable place in which to conceal himself, he heard the sound of voices and the snapping of dry branches under heavy footsteps; men were coming toward him; he took alarm and discharged his piece, believing the Prussians were at hand."
"Silvine, après avoir bandé l’oreille de l’âne avec son mouchoir, venait de reprendre la bride. Et le petit cortège lugubre retraversa le plateau, en sens contraire, pour refaire les deux lieues qui le séparaient de Remilly. À chaque pas, Prosper s’arrêtait, regardait les chevaux morts, le cœur gros de s’éloigner ainsi, sans avoir revu Zéphir.","Silvine, after bandaging the donkey's ear with her handkerchief, had just taken up the bridle.

At each step, Prosper stopped, gazed at the dead horses, his heart heavy at walking away thus, without having seen Zephyr again.","Silvine bandaged the donkey’s ear with a handkerchief and took the bridle again. The little funeral procession re-crossed the plain in the opposite direction to start the two leagues between them and Remilly. At every step Prosper paused to look at dead horses, grief-stricken at going away like this without seeing Zephir again.","Silvine, having bandaged the donkey's ear with her handkerchief, took him again by the bridle, and the mournful little procession began to retrace its steps across the plateau, to cover the two leagues that lay between it and Remilly.

"La commune histoire, que cet amour contrarié d’Honoré Fouchard et de Silvine Morange. Elle, une fille brune aux beaux yeux de soumission, avait perdu toute jeune sa mère, une ouvrière séduite, qui travaillait dans une usine de Raucourt ; et c’était le docteur Dalichamp, son parrain d’occasion, un brave homme toujours prêt à adopter les enfants des malheureuses qu’il accouchait, qui avait eu l’idée de la placer comme petite servante chez le père Fouchard. Certes, le vieux paysan, devenu boucher par un besoin de lucre, promenant sa viande dans vingt communes des environs, était d’une avarice noire, d’une impitoyable dureté ; mais il surveillerait la petite, elle aurait un sort, si elle travaillait. En tout cas, elle serait sauvée de la débauche de l’usine. Et il arriva naturellement que, chez le père Fouchard, le fils de la maison et la petite servante s’aimèrent. Honoré avait eu seize ans, quand Silvine en avait douze, et comme elle en avait seize, il en eut vingt, il tira au sort, ravi d’amener un bon numéro, résolu à l’épouser. Par une honnêteté rare, qui tenait à la nature réfléchie et calme du garçon, rien ne s’était passé entre eux que de grandes embrassades dans la grange. Mais, quand il parla de ce mariage au père, celui-ci exaspéré, têtu, déclara qu’il faudrait le tuer d’abord ; et il garda la fille, tranquillement, espérant qu’ils se contenteraient ensemble, que ça se passerait. Pendant près de dix-huit mois encore, les jeunes gens s’adorèrent, se voulurent, sans se toucher. Puis, à la suite d’une scène abominable entre les deux hommes, le fils, ne pouvant rester davantage, s’engagea, fut envoyé en Afrique, pendant que le vieux s’obstinait à garder sa servante, dont il était content. Alors, ce fut l’affreuse chose : Silvine, qui avait juré d’attendre, se trouva un soir, quinze jours plus tard, dans les bras d’un garçon de ferme engagé depuis quelques mois, ce Goliath Steinberg, le Prussien comme on le nommait, un grand bon enfant aux petits cheveux blonds, à la large face rose toujours souriante, qui était le camarade, le confident d’Honoré. Le père Fouchard, sournoisement, avait-il poussé à cette aventure ? Silvine s’était-elle donnée dans une minute d’inconscience ou avait-elle été à demi violentée, malade de chagrin, affaiblie encore par les larmes de la séparation ? Elle ne savait plus elle-même, comme foudroyée, devenue enceinte, acceptant maintenant la nécessité d’un mariage avec Goliath. Lui, d’ailleurs, toujours souriant, ne disait pas non, reculait simplement la formalité jusqu’à la naissance du petit. Puis, brusquement, à la veille des couches, il disparut. On raconta plus tard qu’il était allé servir dans une autre ferme, du côté de Beaumont. Il y avait trois ans de cela, et personne à cette heure ne doutait que ce Goliath si bon homme, qui faisait si à l’aise des enfants aux filles, était un de ces espions dont l’Allemagne peuplait nos provinces de l’Est. En Afrique, lorsque Honoré avait su cette histoire, il était resté trois mois à l’hôpital, comme si le grand soleil de là-bas l’avait assommé, d’un coup de tison à la nuque ; et jamais il n’avait voulu profiter d’un congé pour revenir au pays, de crainte d’y revoir Silvine et l’enfant.","The common story, that this thwarted love of Honoré Fouchard and Silvine Morange. She, a dark-haired girl with beautiful eyes of submission, had lost her mother at a very young age, a seduced worker who worked in a factory in Raucourt; and it was Doctor Dalichamp, her occasional godfather, a good man always ready to adopt the children of the unfortunates whom he gave birth to, who had had the idea of placing her as a little servant with Father Fouchard. Certainly, the old peasant, who had become a butcher out of a need for lucre, taking his meat to twenty neighboring towns, was blackly avaricious, pitilessly harsh; but he would watch the little one, she would have a spell if she worked. In any case, she would be saved from the debauchery of the factory. And it naturally happened that, at Father Fouchard's, the son of the house and the little servant fell in love. Honoré had been sixteen, when Silvine was twelve, and as she was sixteen, he was twenty, he drew lots, delighted to bring a good number, resolved to marry her. By a rare honesty, which was due to the thoughtful and calm nature of the boy, nothing had happened between them but great embraces in the barn. But, when he spoke of this marriage to the father, the latter, exasperated and stubborn, declared that he would have to be killed first; and he kept the girl, quietly, hoping that they would be content together, that it would pass. For nearly eighteen months more, the young people adored each other, desired each other, without touching each other. Then, following an abominable scene between the two men, the son, unable to stay any longer, enlisted and was sent to Africa, while the old man persisted in keeping his servant, with whom he was happy. Then it was the dreadful thing: Silvine, who had sworn to wait, found herself one evening, a fortnight later, in the arms of a farm boy who had been engaged for a few months, this Goliath Steinberg, the Prussian as named him, a tall, good child with little blond hair, a broad, rosy face, always smiling, who was Honoré's comrade, confidant. Father Fouchard, slyly, had he pushed for this adventure? Had Silvine given herself in a moment of unconsciousness or had she been half-violated, sick with grief, weakened still further by the tears of separation? She no longer knew herself, as if struck down, become pregnant, now accepting the necessity of a marriage with Goliath. He, moreover, always smiling, did not say no, simply postponed the formality until the birth of the little one. Then, suddenly, on the eve of childbirth, he disappeared. It was later said that he had gone to serve on another farm, near Beaumont. It had been three years since, and no one at that hour doubted that this Goliath, so good a man, who gave birth to girls so easily, was one of those spies with whom Germany populated our eastern provinces. . In Africa, when Honoré learned of this story, he had been in the hospital for three months, as if the bright sun there had knocked him out with a firebrand on the back of the neck; and he had never wanted to take advantage of a holiday to return home, for fear of seeing Silvine and the child again.","It was the old, old story, this unhappy love affair of Honoré Fouchard and Silvine Morange. She was a dark girl with meek eyes who had lost her mother when she was quite a child, the mother being a factory worker in Raucourt who had been seduced. Dr Dalichamp, who had obligingly stood godfather (he was a kindly soul always prepared to adopt the babies of the poor girls he delivered), had placed her as a maid at old Fouchard’s. It was true that this old peasant, who had become a butcher for love of gain, hawking his meat round twenty neighbouring parishes, was as miserly as hell and as hard as nails, but he looked after the girl and she would do well if she worked. Anyhow, she would be saved from the lusts of the factory. And of course it happened that in old Fouchard’s establishment the son of the house and the young maid fell in love. Honoré was sixteen then and she was twelve, and when she was sixteen and he twenty he had drawn lots for the call-up and to his delight drawn a lucky number and so resolved to marry her. Nothing had passed between them beyond a good deal of kissing and embracing in the barn – an unusual purity which was part and parcel of the thoughtful and level-headed character of the young man. But when he mentioned marriage to his father, the outraged and obstinate old man declared that it would only be over his dead body, and he calmly kept the girl on, hoping that they would have their fun together and get it over with. For nearly another eighteen months the young pair were madly in love and full of desire but never touched each other. Then after a terrible scene between the two men, the son, who could not stand any more of it, enlisted and was sent to Africa while the old man insisted on keeping the maid, who pleased him. Then the awful thing happened: one evening two weeks later Silvine, who had sworn to wait for him, found herself in the arms of a farm-hand who had been taken on a few months before, Goliath Steinberg, the Prussian as they called him, a big, good-natured fellow with close cropped fair hair and round pink face always smiling, who had been the friend and boon companion of Honoré. Had old Fouchard slyly encouraged this to happen? Had Silvine given herself in a moment of thoughtlessness, or had she been half raped when she was sick with misery and still worn out with weeping over the separation? She did not know herself and was aghast, pregnant and now accepting the necessity of marriage to Goliath. Not that he refused on his side, ever smiling, but he put off the formality until the baby’s arrival. Then suddenly, on the very eve of the birth, he vanished. It was said later that he went and worked at another farm near Beaumont. Three years had gone by since then, and nobody now doubted that this Goliath, such a nice chap, who so enjoyed giving babies to the girls, was one of those spies with whom Germany filled our eastern provinces. When Honoré had heard this story in Africa he spent three months in hospital, as though the fierce sun of those parts had felled him with a hot iron on the back of the neck, and he had never used a leave to go back home, for fear of seeing Silvine and the child.","It was the old story: the course of Honore Fouchard's and Silvine Morange's love had not run smooth. She, a pretty, meek-eyed, brown-haired girl, had in early childhood lost her mother, an operative in one of the factories of Raucourt, and Doctor Dalichamp, her godfather, a worthy man who was greatly addicted to adopting the wretched little beings whom he ushered into the world, had conceived the idea of placing her in Father Fouchard's family as small maid of all work. True it was that the old boor was a terrible skinflint and a harsh, stern taskmaster; he had gone into the butchering business from sordid love of lucre, and his cart was to be seen daily, rain or shine, on the roads of twenty communes; but if the child was willing to work she would have a home and a protector, perhaps some small prospect in the future. At all events she would be spared the contamination of the factory. And naturally enough it came to pass that in old Fouchard's household the son and heir and the little maid of all work fell in love with each other. Honore was then just turned sixteen and she was twelve, and when she was sixteen and he twenty there was a drawing for the army; Honore, to his great delight, secured a lucky number and determined to marry. Nothing had ever passed between them, thanks to the unusual delicacy that was inherent in the lad's tranquil, thoughtful nature, more than an occasional hug and a furtive kiss in the barn. But when he spoke of the marriage to his father, the old man, who had the stubbornness of the mule, angrily told him that his son might kill him, but never, never would he consent, and continued to keep the girl about the house, not worrying about the matter, expecting it would soon blow over. For two years longer the young folks kept on adoring and desiring each other, and never the least breath of scandal sullied their names. Then one day there was a frightful quarrel between the two men, after which the young man, feeling he could no longer endure his father's tyranny, enlisted and was packed off to Africa, while the butcher still retained the servant-maid, because she was useful to him. Soon after that a terrible thing happened: Silvine, who had sworn that she would be true to her lover and await his return, was detected one day, two short weeks after his departure, in the company of a laborer who had been working on the farm for some months past, that Goliah Steinberg, the Prussian, as he was called; a tall, simple young fellow with short, light hair, wearing a perpetual smile on his broad, pink face, who had made himself Honore's chum. Had Father Fouchard traitorously incited the man to take advantage of the girl? or had Silvine, sick at heart and prostrated by the sorrow of parting with her lover, yielded in a moment of unconsciousness? She could not tell herself; was dazed, and saw herself driven by the necessity of her situation to a marriage with Goliah. He, for his part, always with the everlasting smile on his face, made no objection, only insisted on deferring the ceremony until the child should be born. When that event occurred he suddenly disappeared; it was rumored, subsequently that he had found work on another farm, over Beaumont way. These things had happened three years before the breaking out of the war, and now everyone was convinced that that artless, simple Goliah, who had such a way of ingratiating himself with the girls, was none else than one of those Prussian spies who filled our eastern provinces. When Honore learned the tidings over in Africa he was three months in hospital, as if the fierce sun of that country had smitten him on the neck with one of his fiery javelins, and never thereafter did he apply for leave of absence to return to his country for fear lest he might again set eyes on Silvine and her child."
"Presque aussitôt, le soleil reparut, un soleil triomphal, dans la chaude matinée d’août. Et la gaieté revint, les hommes fumaient comme une lessive, étendue au grand air : très vite ils furent secs, pareils à des chiens crottés, retirés d’une mare, plaisantant des sonnettes de fange durcie qu’ils emportaient à leurs pantalons rouges. À chaque carrefour, il fallait s’arrêter encore. Tout au bout d’un faubourg de Reims, il y eut une dernière halte, devant un débit de boissons qui ne désemplissait pas.","Almost immediately the sun reappeared, a triumphant sun, on the hot August morning. And the gaiety returned, the men were smoking like washing powder, spread out in the open air: very quickly they were dry, like muddy dogs, pulled from a pond, joking about the bells of hardened mire which they carried off to their red trousers. At each crossroads, you had to stop again. At the very end of a suburb of Reims, there was a final halt, in front of a pub that was always full.","The sun came out again almost at once, a glorious sun on this hot August morning. And cheerfulness returned; the men were like a line of washing hanging out in the open air, and very soon they were dry, like muddy dogs fished out of a pond, joking about the festoons of caked mud they were carrying on their red trousers. There was a fresh halt at every road junction. At the last outlying houses of Rheims there was a final halt in front of a pub which was doing a roaring trade.","The sun suddenly came shining out again in the clear sky, the warm, bright sun of an August morning, and with it came returning gayety; the men were steaming like a wash of linen hung out to dry in the open air: the moisture evaporated from their clothing in little more time than it takes to tell it, and when they were warm and dry again, like dogs who shake the water from them when they emerge from a pond, they chaffed one another good-naturedly on their bedraggled appearance and the splashes of mud on their red trousers. Wherever two roads intersected another halt was necessitated; the last one was in a little village just beyond the walls of the city, in front of a small saloon that seemed to be doing a thriving business."
"Des larmes l’étouffaient, elle s’affaissa sur la table, secouée de longs sanglots, pendant que le petit, stupéfait d’avoir été bousculé par sa mère, éclatait aussi en pleurs. Elle le reprit, le serra contre elle, avec des paroles éperdues, bégayées.","Tears were choking her, she sank down on the table, shaking with long sobs, while the little one, amazed at having been jostled by his mother, also burst into tears. She picked him up again, hugged him to her, with distraught, stammering words.","Tears choked her words and she collapsed on the table, shaken with bitter sobs, and the child, outraged at having been roughly handled by his mother, burst into tears as well. She took him back and clasped him to her, uttering disjointed words:","Her tears allowed her to say no more; she bowed her head upon the table, her frame convulsed by long-drawn, tumultuous sobs that shook her from head to foot, while the child, not knowing what to make of such unusual treatment at his mother's hands, also commenced to weep violently. She caught him up and pressed him to her heart, with distracted, stammering words:"
"Là seulement, les obus tombaient. Henriette resta figée, très pâle, dans l’assourdissement d’une effrayante détonation, dont le coup de vent l’enveloppa. Un projectile venait d’éclater devant elle, à quelques mètres. Elle tourna la tête, examina les hauteurs de la rive gauche, d’où montaient les fumées des batteries allemandes ; et elle comprit, se remit en marche, les yeux fixés sur l’horizon, guettant les obus, pour les éviter. La témérité folle de sa course n’allait pas sans un grand sang-froid, toute la tranquillité brave dont sa petite âme de bonne ménagère était capable. Elle voulait ne pas être tuée, retrouver son mari, le reprendre, vivre ensemble, heureux encore. Les obus ne cessaient plus, elle filait le long des murs, se jetait derrière les bornes, profitait des moindres abris. Mais il se présenta un espace découvert, un bout de chemin défoncé, déjà couvert d’éclats ; et elle attendait, à l’encoignure d’un hangar, lorsqu’elle aperçut, devant elle, au ras d’une sorte de trou, la tête curieuse d’un enfant, qui regardait. C’était un petit garçon de dix ans, pieds nus, habillé d’une seule chemise et d’un pantalon en lambeaux, quelque rôdeur de route, très amusé par la bataille. Ses minces yeux noirs pétillaient, et il s’exclamait d’allégresse, à chaque détonation.","Only there did the shells fall. Henriette remained motionless, very pale, in the deafening of a frightful explosion, the gust of which enveloped her. A projectile had just exploded in front of her, a few meters away. She turned her head, examined the heights of the left bank, whence rose the smoke of the German batteries; and she understood, started walking again, her eyes fixed on the horizon, watching for shells, to avoid them. The mad temerity of her course was not without a great sangfroid, all the brave tranquility of which her little soul as a good housewife was capable. She wanted not to be killed, to find her husband, to take him back, to live together, still happy. The shells never stopped, she sped along the walls, threw herself behind the boundary stones, took advantage of the slightest shelter. But there presented itself an open space, a rutted stretch of road, already covered with splinters; and she was waiting, at the corner of a shed, when she perceived, in front of her, on the level of a sort of hole, the curious head of a child, who was watching. He was a ten-year-old boy, barefoot, dressed in a single shirt and tattered trousers, some road prowler, much amused by the battle. His thin black eyes sparkled, and he exclaimed with delight at each shot.","But there the shells were falling. Henriette stood rooted to the spot, very pale in the deafening noise of a frightful explosion, and hit by the blast. A shell had exploded only a few metres away from her. She looked back at the heights on the opposite side of the river, from which puffs of smoke from the German batteries were rising, and she understood, but went on again, with eyes fixed on the horizon, looking for shells so that she could dodge them. The rash temerity of her journey was not devoid of cool-headedness, indeed it had all the brave calm that a good little housewife can muster. She simply wanted not to be killed, to find her husband and take him home so that they could live happily again. The bombardment was incessant, and she glided along by the walls, taking cover behind stone bollards or any sort of shelter. But then came an open space, a piece of street that had been demolished and was already covered with rubble, and she was pausing at the corner of a barn when, down at ground level sticking out of a sort of hole, she caught sight of a child’s inquisitive face, watching intently. It was a little boy of ten, barefoot and with torn shirt and trousers, some kid on the prowl who was thoroughly enjoying the battle. His little black eyes were sparkling and he uttered exclamations of delight at each explosion.","But the missiles seemed to be falling there even more thickly than elsewhere. Henriette stopped short in her tracks and all the blood in her body seemed to flow back upon her heart at a frightful detonation, so close that she could feel the wind upon her cheek. A shell had exploded directly before her and only a few yards away. She turned her head and scrutinized for a moment the heights of the left bank, above which the smoke from the German batteries was curling upward; she saw what she must do, and when she started on her way again it was with eyes fixed on the horizon, watching for the shells in order to avoid them. There was method in the rash daring of her proceeding, and all the brave tranquillity that the prudent little housewife had at her command. She was not going to be killed if she could help it; she wished to find her husband and bring him back with her, that they might yet have many days of happy life together. The projectiles still came tumbling frequently as ever; she sped along behind walls, made a cover of boundary stones, availed herself of every slight depression. But presently she came to an open space, a bit of unprotected road where splinters and fragments of exploded shells lay thick, and she was watching behind a shed for a chance to make a dash when she perceived, emerging from a sort of cleft in the ground in front of her, a human head and two bright eyes that peered about inquisitively. It was a little, bare-footed, ten-year-old boy, dressed in a shirt and ragged trousers, an embryonic tramp, who was watching the battle with huge delight. At every report his small black beady eyes would snap and sparkle, and he jubilantly shouted:"
"– Faites, major.","– Do it, Major.","‘Carry on, major.’","“Do as you think best, major.”"
"Tous se fâchaient. On ne fatiguait pas des hommes de la sorte, pour le plaisir de les promener. Et, par la plaine nue, entre les larges plis de terrain, ils avançaient en colonne, sur deux files, une à chaque bord, entre lesquelles circulaient les officiers ; mais ce n’était plus, ainsi qu’au lendemain de Reims, en Champagne, une marche égayée de plaisanteries et de chansons, le sac porté gaillardement, les épaules allégées par l’espoir de devancer les Prussiens et de les battre : maintenant, silencieux, irrités, ils traînaient la jambe, avec la haine du fusil qui leur meurtrissait l’épaule, du sac dont ils étaient écrasés, ayant cessé de croire à leurs chefs, se laissant envahir par une telle désespérance, qu’ils ne marchaient plus en avant que comme un bétail, sous la fatalité du fouet. La misérable armée commençait à monter son calvaire.","Everyone was angry. One did not tire such men for the pleasure of taking them for a walk. And, across the bare plain, between the wide folds of ground, they advanced in column, in two files, one on each side, between which the officers circulated; but it was no longer, like the day after Reims, in Champagne, a march enlivened with jokes and songs, the bag carried cheerfully, the shoulders lightened by the hope of getting ahead of the Prussians and beating them: now, silent, irritated, they dragged their legs, with the hatred of the rifle which bruised their shoulder, of the bag with which they were crushed, having ceased to believe in their leaders, letting themselves be invaded by such despair, that they could no longer walk. forward than like cattle, under the fatality of the whip. The wretched army was beginning to mount its Calvary.","They were all losing their tempers. You don’t wear men out like this just for the fun of walking them about. Over the bare plain between the gentle ups and downs, they moved on in column in two lines, one on each side of the road, between which the officers move up and down. But gone was the time, as in Champagne the day after Rheims, when the march was cheered with jokes and songs, when their packs were carried gaily and the load on their shoulders was lightened by the hope of racing the Prussians and beating them. Now they dragged their feet in angry silence, hating their rifles which bruised their shoulders and the packs that weighed them down, having lost all faith in their commanders and giving way to such hopelessness that they were only marching ahead like a herd of cattle lashed by the whip of fate. The wretched army was beginning to climb its hill of Calvary.","The anger and disgust were general. It was not right to make men suffer like that, just for the fun of walking them up and down the country. They were advancing in column across the naked plain in two files occupying the sides of the road, leaving a free central space in which the officers could move to and fro and keep an eye on their men, but it was not the same now as it had been in Champagne after they left Rheims, a march of song and jollity, when they tramped along gayly and the knapsack was like a feather to their shoulders, in the belief that soon they would come up with the Prussians and give them a sound drubbing; now they were dragging themselves wearily forward in angry silence, cursing the musket that galled their shoulder and the equipments that seemed to weigh them to the ground, their faith in their leaders gone, and possessed by such bitterness of despair that they only went forward as does a file of manacled galley-slaves, in terror of the lash. The wretched army had begun to ascend its Calvary."
"– Non, non, lieutenant, ils vont tous me suivre… N’est-ce pas, mes enfants, vous n’allez pas laisser votre vieux colonel se débarbouiller tout seul avec les Prussiens ?… En avant, là-haut !","""No, no, Lieutenant, they're all going to follow me... Aren't you, my children, you're not going to leave your old colonel to fend for himself with the Prussians?... Forward, up there!""","‘No, no, lieutenant, they’re all going to follow me … Aren’t you, boys?… You’re not going to let your old colonel have it out with the Prussians on his own! Come on, up and at ’em!’","“No, no, lieutenant; they will follow me. Won't you, my children? You won't let your old colonel fight it out alone with the Prussians! Up there lies the way; forward!”"
"Et, à cette minute, leurs yeux se rencontrèrent, et ils restèrent bouleversés de ce qu’ils pouvaient enfin y lire nettement. Le passé s’évoquait, la chambre perdue de Remilly, où ils avaient vécu des jours si tristes et si doux. Lui, retrouvait son rêve, d’abord inconscient, ensuite à peine formulé : la vie là-bas, un mariage, une petite maison, la culture d’un champ qui suffirait à nourrir un ménage de braves gens modestes. Maintenant, c’était un désir ardent, une certitude aiguë qu’avec une femme comme elle, si tendre, si active, si brave, la vie serait devenue une véritable existence de paradis. Et, elle, qui autrefois n’était pas même effleurée par ce rêve, dans le don chaste et ignoré de son cœur, voyait clair à présent, comprenait tout d’un coup. Ce mariage lointain, elle-même l’avait voulu alors, sans le savoir. La graine qui germait avait cheminé sourdement, elle l’aimait d’amour, ce garçon près duquel elle n’avait d’abord été que consolée. Et leurs regards se disaient cela, et ils ne s’aimaient ouvertement, à cette heure, que pour l’adieu éternel. Il fallait encore cet affreux sacrifice, l’arrachement dernier, leur bonheur possible la veille s’écroulant aujourd’hui avec le reste, s’en allant avec le flot de sang qui venait d’emporter leur frère.","And, at that moment, their eyes met, and they remained overwhelmed at what they could finally read there clearly. The past was evoked, the lost room of Remilly, where they had lived such sad and sweet days. He was rediscovering his dream, at first unconscious, then barely formulated: life there, a wedding, a small house, the cultivation of a field that would be enough to feed a household of good modest people. Now it was a longing, an acute certainty that with a woman like her, so tender, so active, so brave, life would have become a true existence of paradise. And she, who formerly was not even touched by this dream, in the chaste and unknown gift of her heart, now saw clearly, suddenly understood. This distant marriage, she herself had wanted it then, without knowing it. The seed that was germinating had traveled silently, she loved him with love, this boy near whom she had at first only been consoled. And their looks told each other that, and they loved each other openly, at this hour, only for the eternal farewell. This terrible sacrifice was still needed, the last uprooting, their happiness possible the day before collapsing today with the rest, leaving with the flood of blood that had just carried off their brother.","At that moment they looked into each other’s eyes, and they were heartbroken at what at last they could clearly read in them. The past came to life, the secluded room at Remilly in which they had lived such sad, sweet days together. It brought him back to his daydream, unconscious at first and even later never clearly formulated, life down there, marriage, a little house and work on a plot of land that would suffice to keep a family of honest, humble folk. But now it had become a passionate longing, a painful certainty that with a woman like her, so tender, so active, so brave, life might have become a real paradise. She too, who formerly had not even been touched by this dream, though unconsciously giving her heart in perfect purity, now saw plainly and suddenly understood. This eventual marriage was what she herself had wanted, without realizing it. The seed had quickened and imperceptibly grown and now she loved with real love this man with whom at first she had only found consolation. Their eyes told each other all this, and now they loved each other openly only in time to say an eternal farewell. This one more dreadful sacrifice had to be made, this final tearing asunder; their happiness, still feasible yesterday, was now crumbling into dust like everything else, and being washed away in the stream of blood that had taken their brother.","At that moment their glances met, and they were stricken with consternation at what they read in each other's eyes. The past rose before them, the secluded chamber at Remilly, where they had spent so many melancholy yet happy days. His dream returned to him, that dream of which at first he had been barely conscious and which even at a later period could not be said to have assumed definite shape: life down there in the pleasant country by the Meuse, marriage, a little house, a little field to till whose produce should suffice for the needs of two people whose ideas were not extravagant. Now the dream was become an eager longing, a penetrating conviction that, with a wife as loving and industrious as she, existence would be a veritable earthly paradise. And she, the tranquillity of whose mind had never in those days been ruffled by thoughts of that nature, in the chaste and unconscious bestowal of her heart, now saw clearly and understood the true condition of her feelings. That marriage, of which she had not admitted to herself the possibility, had been, unknown to her, the object of her desire. The seed that had germinated had pushed its way in silence and in darkness; it was love, not sisterly affection, that she bore toward that young man whose company had at first been to her nothing more than a source of comfort and consolation. And that was what their eyes told each other, and the love thus openly expressed could have no other fruition than an eternal farewell. It needed but that frightful sacrifice, the rending of their heart-strings by that supreme parting, the prospect of their life's happiness wrecked amid all the other ruins, swept away by the crimson tide that ended their brother's life."
"– Allons, murmura-t-il, la danse va être complète.","– Come on, he whispered, the dance is going to be complete.","‘Here we go,’ he murmured, ‘this will open the ball.’","“Well, well,” he murmured, “they are all going to have a hand in the business, it seems.”"
"Mais elle ne répondait pas, elle serrait l’enfant plus fort, comme si elle eût craint qu’on ne le lui arrachât tout de suite ; et, dans ses grands yeux, montait une exécration épouvantée.","But she did not answer, she gripped the child tighter, as if she were afraid that someone would snatch him from her at once; and, in his large eyes, rose a terrified execration.","But she said nothing, and held the child closer as though afraid he might be snatched away there and then, and her great eyes filled with fear and loathing.","But she made no answer, straining the little one more closely to her breast as if fearing he might be torn from her then and there, and in her great eyes was a look of mingled terror and execration."

"Peut-être la pensée terrible des responsabilités se levait-elle en lui, avec la vision des cadavres sanglants que ses fautes avaient couchés là-bas, par milliers ; et peut-être n’était-ce que l’attendrissement de son cœur pitoyable de rêveur, de bon homme hanté de songeries humanitaires. Dans cet effrayant coup du sort qui brisait et emportait sa fortune, ainsi qu’un brin de paille, il trouvait des larmes pour les autres, éperdu de la boucherie inutile qui continuait, sans force pour la supporter davantage. Maintenant, cette canonnade scélérate lui cassait la poitrine, redoublait son mal.","Perhaps the terrible thought of responsibility arose in him, with the vision of the bloody corpses that his faults had laid there, by the thousands; and perhaps it was only the tenderness of his pitiful heart of a dreamer, of a good man haunted by humanitarian dreams. In this frightful twist of fate which shattered and carried away his fortune, like a wisp of straw, he found tears for others, distraught at the useless butchery which continued, without the strength to bear it any longer. Now this villainous cannonade broke his chest, redoubled his pain.","Perhaps the terrible vision of his responsibilities rose before him, of the bleeding corpses his misdeeds had strewn over the fields in thousands; perhaps it was just the sentimental pity of a dreamer’s heart, of a good man haunted by humanitarian ideas. In this dreadful blow of fate that broke off and carried away his own fortune like a wisp of straw he could find tears for others, and was horrified at the continuing useless butchery, too weak to bear it any longer. Now this murderous cannonade seemed to hit him in the chest and redouble his pain.","Perhaps the dreadful thought of his responsibilities arose before him, with the vision of all those thousands of bleeding forms with which his errors had cumbered the earth; perhaps, again, it was but the compassionate impulse of the tender-hearted dreamer, of the well-meaning man whose mind was stocked with humanitarian theories. At the moment when he beheld utter ruin staring him in the face, in that frightful whirlwind of destruction that broke him like a reed and scattered his fortunes in the dust, he could yet find tears for others. Almost crazed at the thought of the slaughter that was mercilessly going on so near him, he felt he had not strength to endure it longer; each report of that accursed cannonade seemed to pierce his heart and intensified a thousandfold his own private suffering."
"On faisait bon ménage, sous l’autorité grandissante de Jean. Maurice, complaisamment, lut les nouvelles intéressantes, pendant que Pache, la couturière de l’escouade, lui raccommodait sa capote, et que Lapoulle nettoyait son fusil. D’abord, ce fut une grande victoire de Bazaine, qui avait culbuté tout un corps prussien dans les carrières de Jaumont ; et ce récit imaginaire était accompagné de circonstances dramatiques, les hommes et les chevaux s’écrasant parmi les roches, un anéantissement complet, pas même des cadavres entiers à mettre en terre. Ensuite, c’étaient des détails copieux sur le pitoyable état des armées allemandes, depuis qu’elles se trouvaient en France : les soldats, mal nourris, mal équipés, tombés à l’absolu dénuement, mouraient en masse, le long des chemins, frappés d’affreuses maladies. Un autre article disait que le roi de Prusse avait la diarrhée et que Bismarck s’était cassé la jambe, en sautant par la fenêtre d’une auberge, dans laquelle des zouaves avaient failli le prendre. Bon, tout cela ! Lapoulle en riait à se fendre les mâchoires, pendant que Chouteau et les autres, sans émettre l’ombre d’un doute, crânaient à l’idée de ramasser bientôt les Prussiens, comme des moineaux dans un champ, après la grêle. Et surtout on se tordait de la culbute de Bismarck. Oh ! les zouaves et les turcos, c’en étaient des braves, ceux-là ! Toutes sortes de légendes circulaient, l’Allemagne tremblait et se fâchait, en disant qu’il était indigne d’une nation civilisée de se faire défendre ainsi par des sauvages. Bien que décimés déjà à Frœschwiller, ils semblaient encore intacts et invincibles.","We got along well, under the growing authority of Jean. Maurice complacently read the interesting news, while Pache, the squad's seamstress, was mending his greatcoat, and Lapoulle was cleaning his gun. First, it was a great victory for Bazaine, who had overthrown a whole Prussian corps in the quarries of Jaumont; and this imaginary story was accompanied by dramatic circumstances, men and horses crashing among the rocks, complete annihilation, not even whole corpses to be buried. Then there were copious details of the pitiful state of the German armies since they had been in France: the soldiers, badly fed, badly equipped, fallen into absolute destitution, were dying en masse along the roads, stricken with terrible diseases. Another article said that the King of Prussia had diarrhea and that Bismarck had broken his leg, jumping out of the window of an inn, in which the Zouaves had almost taken him. Well, all of that! Lapoulle was laughing his ass off, while Chouteau and the others, without the shadow of a doubt, were saucy at the idea of picking up the Prussians soon, like sparrows in a field, after hail. And above all we writhed from Bismarck's somersault. Oh ! the Zouaves and Turcos were brave ones! All sorts of legends circulated, Germany trembled and grew angry, saying that it was unworthy of a civilized nation to be thus defended by savages. Although already decimated at Frœschwiller, they still seemed intact and invincible.","Under the growing authority of Jean they were sharing the jobs well. Maurice obligingly read out the interesting bits of news while Pache, the housewife of the outfit, mended his cape for him and Lapoulle cleaned his rifle. First it was a great victory for Bazaine, who had knocked out a whole Prussian army corps in the Jaumont quarries, and this work of imagination was served up with dramatic details – men and horses crushed to death among the rocks, total annihilation, not even any corpses left intact to bury. Then there were plentiful details on the pitiful state of the German troops since they had been in France: soldiers ill fed, badly equipped, reduced to absolute destitution, dying in hordes along the roads, struck down by fell diseases. Another article reported that the King of Prussia had diarrhoea and that Bismarck had broken his leg as he leaped out of the window of an inn in which the Zouaves had nearly caught him. That’s grand! Lapoulle grinned from ear to ear, and Chouteau and the others, without showing the slightest sign of doubt, were cock-a-hoop at the idea of soon picking up Prussians like sparrows in a field after a hailstorm. They were especially tickled about Bismarck’s going arse over tip. Oh those Zouaves and Turcos weren’t half a lot, they were! All sorts of fairy tales went round – Germany was terrified and angry, saying it was unworthy of a civilized nation to get savages like that to defend her. Although they had already been decimated at Froeschwiller they were apparently still intact and invincible.","They were a happy family under Jean's mild despotism. Maurice good-naturedly read such news as he thought might interest them, while Pache, the seamstress of the company, mended his greatcoat for him and Lapoulle cleaned his musket. The first item was a splendid victory won by Bazaine, who had driven an entire Prussian corps into the quarries of Jaumont, and the trumped-up tale was told with an abundance of dramatic detail, how men and horses went over the precipice and were crushed on the rocks beneath out of all semblance of humanity, so that there was not one whole corpse found for burial. Then there were minute details of the pitiable condition of the German armies ever since they had invaded France: the ill-fed, poorly equipped soldiers were actually falling from inanition and dying by the roadside of horrible diseases. Another article told how the king of Prussia had the diarrhea, and how Bismarck had broken his leg in jumping from the window of an inn where a party of zouaves had just missed capturing him. Capital news! Lapoulle laughed over it as if he would split his sides, while Chouteau and the others, without expressing the faintest doubt, chuckled at the idea that soon they would be picking up Prussians as boys pick up sparrows in a field after a hail-storm. But they laughed loudest at old Bismarck's accident; oh! the zouaves and the turcos, they were the boys for one's money! It was said that the Germans were in an ecstasy of fear and rage, declaring that it was unworthy of a nation that claimed to be civilized to employ such heathen savages in its armies. Although they had been decimated at Froeschwiller, the foreign troops seemed to have a good deal of life left in them."
"– Voyons, dors, mon chéri, répétait Silvine, qui l’avait porté dans la chambre d’Henriette, tu vois comme tu es bien, sur le grand dodo à bonne amie !","""Come on, go to sleep, darling,"" repeated Silvine, who had carried him into Henriette's room, ""you see how well you are, on your good friend's bedtime!""","‘Now come along, my darling, off we go to sleep,’ Silvine said over and over again in Henriette’s room where she had taken him. ‘ See how nice it is in Auntie’s big beddybyes!’","“Come, my darling, go to sleep,” said Silvine, who had taken him to Henriette's room; “mamma has put you in the nice lady's big bed.”"
"Une légère chute de plâtras lui fit lever la tête. C’était une balle qui venait d’écorner sa maison, dont il apercevait la façade, par-dessus le mur mitoyen. Il en fut très contrarié, il gronda :","A slight fall of plaster made him raise his head. It was a bullet that had just dented his house, of which he could see the facade, above the adjoining wall. He was very upset, he growled:","A little fall of plaster made him look up. It was a bullet that had chipped a bit off his house, one side of which he could see over the party wall. This annoyed him very much, and he fumed:","A sound of falling plaster caused him to raise his head; a shot had grazed his house, the front of which was visible to him above the party wall. It angered him excessively, and he growled:"
"En bas, ils retombèrent dans le Sedan assombri du matin. Le crépuscule noyait déjà les rues étroites, toute une agitation confuse obstruait le pavé. La plupart des boutiques s’étaient fermées, les maisons semblaient mortes, tandis que, dehors, on s’écrasait. Cependant, sans trop de peine, ils avaient atteint la place de l’Hôtel-de-Ville, lorsqu’ils firent la rencontre de Delaherche, flânant là, en curieux. Tout de suite, il s’exclama, parut enchanté de reconnaître Maurice, raconta qu’il venait justement de reconduire le capitaine Beaudoin, du côté de Floing, où était le régiment ; et son habituelle satisfaction augmenta encore, lorsqu’il sut que Weiss allait coucher à Bazeilles ; car lui-même, comme il le disait à l’instant au capitaine, avait résolu de passer également la nuit à sa teinturerie, pour voir.","Downstairs they fell back into the darkened Sedan of the morning. Twilight was already drowning the narrow streets, a whole confused bustle obstructed the pavement. Most of the shops had closed, the houses seemed dead, while outside it was crashing. However, without too much difficulty, they had reached the Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville, when they met Delaherche, strolling there, curious. He immediately exclaimed, seemed delighted to recognize Maurice, related that he had just escorted Captain Beaudoin back to Floing, where the regiment was; and his usual satisfaction increased still more when he learned that Weiss was going to sleep at Bazeilles; for he himself, as he was just telling the captain, had resolved to pass the night also at his dyehouse, to see.","Down below they were back in the dark Sedan of the morning. Already the narrow streets were melting into the dusk, and the roadways were cluttered up with mysterious activity. Most of the shops were shut, and houses seemed dead, whereas out in the open there was an appalling crush. But still they had managed without too much difficulty to get to the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville when they ran into Delaherche, who was wandering about to see what he could see. He at once exclaimed how delighted he was to see Maurice, told them how he had just taken Captain Beaudoin back to Floing where his regiment was, and his usual self-satisfaction increased when he heard that Weiss was going to sleep out at Bazeilles, for as he had just told the captain, he had made up his mind to spend the night there at his dyeworks, just to keep an eye on things.","Once they were outside they found the same gloomy and forbidding Sedan that had greeted their eyes that morning. Twilight with its shadows had invaded the narrow streets, sidewalk and carriage-way alike were filled with a confused, surging throng. Most of the shops were closed, the houses seemed to be dead or sleeping, while out of doors the crowd was so dense that men trod on one another. With some little difficulty, however, they succeeded in reaching the Place de l'Hotel de Ville, where they encountered M. Delaherche, intent on picking up the latest news and seeing what was to be seen. He at once came up and greeted them, apparently delighted to meet Maurice, to whom he said that he had just returned from accompanying Captain Beaudoin over to Floing, where the regiment was posted, and he became, if that were possible, even more gracious than ever upon learning that Weiss proposed to pass the night at Bazeilles, where he himself, he declared, had just been telling the captain that he intended to take a bed, in order to see how things were looking at the dyehouse."
– Attention ! les voici ! cria le capitaine.,- Attention ! here they are ! cried the captain.,"‘Look out, here they come!’ cried the captain.",“Look out! here they come!” shouted the lieutenant.
"Lorsqu’ils traversèrent Bazeilles, Jean et Maurice songèrent à Weiss, cherchèrent les cendres de la petite maison, si vaillamment défendue. On leur avait conté, au Camp de la Misère, la dévastation du village, les incendies, les massacres ; et ce qu’ils voyaient dépassait les abominations rêvées. Après douze jours, les tas de décombres fumaient encore. Des murs croulants s’étaient abattus, il ne restait pas dix maisons intactes. Mais ce qui les consola un peu, ce fut de rencontrer des brouettes, des charrettes pleines de casques et de fusils bavarois, ramassés après la lutte. Cette preuve qu’on en avait tué beaucoup, de ces égorgeurs et de ces incendiaires, les soulageait.","When they passed through Bazeilles, Jean and Maurice thought of Weiss, looked for the ashes of the little house, so valiantly defended. They had been told, at the Camp de la Misere, of the devastation of the village, the fires, the massacres; and what they saw was beyond the dreamed abominations. After twelve days, the piles of rubble were still smoking. Crumbling walls had come down, there were not ten houses left intact. But what consoled them a little was to meet wheelbarrows, carts full of Bavarian helmets and guns, picked up after the struggle. This proof that many had been killed, of these murderers and arsonists, relieved them.","When they went through Bazeilles Jean and Maurice thought of Weiss and looked for the ashes of the little house that had been so valiantly defended. At the Camp of Hell they had been told about the devastation of the village, the fires and the massacres, but what they saw was worse than their most horrible dreams. After twelve days the heaps of ruins were still smoking. Tottering walls had fallen and not ten houses were left intact. They did find some consolation in the numbers of barrows and carts they saw full of Bavarian helmets and rifles picked up after the battle. This proof that they had killed a lot of these murderers and fire-raisers was some comfort.","When they passed through Bazeilles Jean and Maurice thought of Weiss, and cast their eyes about in an effort to distinguish the site of the little house that had been defended with such bravery. While they were at Camp Misery they had heard the woeful tale of slaughter and conflagration that had blotted the pretty village from existence, and the abominations that they now beheld exceeded all they had dreamed of or imagined. At the expiration of twelve days the ruins were smoking still; the tottering walls had fallen in, there were not ten houses standing. It afforded them some small comfort, however, to meet a procession of carts and wheelbarrows loaded with Bavarian helmets and muskets that had been collected after the conflict. That evidence of the chastisement that had been inflicted on those murderers and incendiaries went far toward mitigating the affliction of defeat."

"– Messieurs, plaida Ducat en se levant, mon client est en effet la plus infecte des canailles, et je n’accepterais pas de le défendre, si je n’avais à faire remarquer, pour son excuse, qu’ils sont tous comme ça, dans son pays… Regardez-le, vous voyez bien, à ses yeux, qu’il est très étonné. Il ne comprend pas son crime. En France, nous ne touchons nos espions qu’avec des pincettes ; tandis que, là-bas, l’espionnage est une carrière très honorée, une façon méritoire de servir son pays… Je me permettrai même de dire, messieurs, qu’ils n’ont peut-être pas tort. Nos nobles sentiments nous font honneur, mais le pis est qu’ils nous ont fait battre. Si j’ose m’exprimer ainsi, quos vult perdere Jupiter dementat… Vous apprécierez, messieurs.","“Gentlemen,” pleaded Ducat, rising, “my client is indeed the most revolting of scoundrels, and I would not agree to defend him, if I had not to point out, for his excuse, that they are all like that. , in his country… Look at him, you can clearly see, in his eyes, that he is very surprised. He does not understand his crime. In France, we only touch our spies with tweezers; while, over there, espionage is a very honored career, a meritorious way of serving one's country... I would even venture to say, gentlemen, that they may not be wrong. Our noble sentiments do us honor, but the worst is that they have caused us to be beaten. If I dare express myself thus, quos vult perdere Jupiter dementat… You will appreciate, gentlemen.","‘Gentlemen,’ said Ducat, rising to make his plea, ‘my client is indeed the most stinking of rogues, and I would not undertake to defend him were it not my duty to point out in mitigation that they are all like that in his country… ‘Look at him, you can see by his eyes that he is quite amazed. He doesn’t realize his crime. In France we only touch our spies with tongs, but in his country spying is a very honourable career, a meritorious way of serving one’s country… I will even go so far as to say, gentlemen, that they may not be wrong. Our noble sentiments do us honour, but unfortunately they have led us to defeat. If I may so express it, quos vult perdere Jupiter dementat… You will appreciate the point of that, Gentlemen.’","Ducat arose and commenced his plea. “Gentlemen, my client, to tell the truth, is the most noisome blackguard that I ever came across in my life, and I should not have been willing to appear in his defense had I not a mitigating circumstance to plead, to wit: they are all that way in the country he came from. Look at him closely; you will read his astonishment in his eyes; he does not understand the gravity of his offense. Here in France we may employ spies, but no one would touch one of them unless with a pair of pincers, while in that country espionage is considered a highly honorable career and an extremely meritorious manner of serving the state. I will even go so far as to say, gentlemen, that possibly they are not wrong; our noble sentiments do us honor, but they have also the disadvantage of bringing us defeat. If I may venture to speak in the language of Cicero and Virgil, quos vult perdere Jupiter dementat. You will understand the allusion, gentlemen.”"
"Dans sa révolte, elle était devenue grave, d’une beauté douloureuse et irritée qui la transfigurait. Et, brusquement, sa gaieté coquette, son insoucieuse légèreté revinrent, au milieu d’un invincible rire.","In her revolt, she had become serious, with a painful and irritated beauty that transfigured her. And suddenly her coquettish gaiety, her carefree levity returned, amid an invincible laughter.","Her outrage had made her serious, with a suffering and angry beauty that transfigured her. But suddenly her coquettish gaiety and careless frivolity came back in an irrepressible laugh.","In the earnestness of her protestations her beauty had assumed an angry and more lofty cast that made her look other than she was. And all at once, sudden as a flash, her coquettish gayety, her thoughtless levity, came back to her face, accompanied by a peal of silvery laughter."
– Foutu !,- Damn!,‘He’s a goner!’,Then he succinctly completed his diagnosis: “His jig is up!”
"Déjà, tout le wagon, retourné, soulevé par la belle crânerie de Jean, abandonnait Chouteau, qui bégayait, reculant devant les gros poings de son adversaire.","Already the whole carriage, turned upside down, lifted by Jean's handsome swagger, was abandoning Chouteau, who was stammering, recoiling before the big fists of his adversary.","At once the whole waggon-load turned round, and, caught up by Jean’s fine burst of confidence, they left Chouteau high and dry, spluttering and backing away from Jean’s big fists.","By this time the whole car, won over by Jean's manly attitude, had deserted Chouteau, who cowered back in his seat as if not anxious to face his opponent's big fists."
"De la même voix tranquille et comme indifférente, il donna quelques détails sur la défaite du 5e corps, surpris à Beaumont au moment de faire la soupe, forcé de se replier, culbuté jusqu’à Mouzon par les Bavarois. Des soldats débandés, fous de panique, qui traversaient Remilly, lui avaient crié que de Failly venait encore de les vendre à Bismarck. Et Maurice songeait à ces marches affolées des deux derniers jours, à ces ordres du maréchal de Mac-Mahon hâtant la retraite, voulant passer la Meuse à tout prix, lorsqu’on avait perdu en incompréhensibles hésitations tant de journées précieuses. Il était trop tard. Sans doute le maréchal, qui s’était emporté en trouvant à Oches le 7e corps, qu’il croyait à la Besace, avait dû être convaincu que le 5e corps campait déjà à Mouzon, lorsque celui-ci, s’attardant à Beaumont, s’y laissait écraser. Mais qu’exiger de troupes mal commandées, démoralisées par l’attente et la fuite, mourantes de faim et de fatigue ?","In the same calm and seemingly indifferent voice, he gave some details of the defeat of the 5th corps, surprised at Beaumont at the moment of making soup, forced to fall back, knocked down as far as Mouzon by the Bavarians. Disbanded soldiers, mad with panic, who were crossing Remilly, had shouted to him that de Failly had just sold them to Bismarck again. And Maurice thought of those frantic marches of the last two days, of those orders from Marshal Mac-Mahon hastening the retreat, wishing to cross the Meuse at any cost, when so many precious days had been lost in incomprehensible hesitation. It was too late. Doubtless the Marshal, who had lost his temper on finding the 7th Corps at Oches, which he believed to be at La Besace, must have been convinced that the 5th Corps was already encamped at Mouzon, when the latter, lingering at Beaumont, let himself be crushed there. But what can be demanded of troops badly commanded, demoralized by waiting and flight, dying of hunger and fatigue?","In the same level and almost indifferent voice he gave a few details about the defeat of the 5th corps, taken by surprise at Beaumont just as they were preparing a meal, forced to withdraw and kicked back to Mouzon by the Bavarians. A lot of fleeing soldiers, rushing panic-stricken through Remilly, had called out to him that de Failly had once again sold them to Bismarck. Maurice recalled the frantic marches of the last two days, the orders from MacMahon stepping up the retreat so as to cross the Meuse at all costs, when they had lost so many precious days in incomprehensible hesitations. Now it was too late. Perhaps the marshal, who had been furious at finding the 7th corps in Oches when he thought it was at La Besace, had been convinced that the 5th was already encamped at Mouzon, whereas it was dallying at Beaumont and letting itself be annihilated. But what can you expect from troops badly commanded, demoralized by delay and flight, dying of hunger and fatigue?","In the same unmoved voice, as if the matter were one of perfect indifference to him, he gave them some tidings of the defeat of the 5th corps, that had been surprised at Beaumont while the men were making their soup and chased by the Bavarians all the way to Mouzon. Some fugitives who had passed through Remilly, mad with terror, had told him that they had been betrayed once more and that de Failly had sold them to Bismarck. Maurice's thoughts reverted to the aimless, blundering movements of the last two days, to Marshal MacMahon hurrying on their retreat and insisting on getting them across the Meuse at every cost, after wasting so many precious hours in incomprehensible delays. It was too late. Doubtless the marshal, who had stormed so on finding the 7th corps still at Osches when he supposed it to be at la Besace, had felt assured that the 5th corps was safe in camp at Mouzon when, lingering in Beaumont, it had come to grief there. But what could they expect from troops so poorly officered, demoralized by suspense and incessant retreat, dying with hunger and fatigue?"
"– Fichtre ! répéta-t-il, voilà un mauvais pied !","- Damn! he repeated, that's a bad foot!",‘Gosh!’ he said again. ‘ That’s a bad foot!’,"His face was very grave, and he pursed his lips in a way that was habitual with him when he had a more than usually serious case to deal with. “Confound it,” he repeated, “I don't like the looks of that foot!”"
– Amenez les avant-trains !,"""Bring on the limbers!""",‘Limber up!’,"It was time to take some step to baffle that tremendous fire, notwithstanding the danger there was in moving, and the captain unhesitatingly gave orders to bring up the limbers."
"En chemin, le petit fermier ne cessa de gémir sur l’abomination des temps. Il n’avait pas eu le courage de rester à Falaise ; et il regrettait déjà de ne plus y être, répétant qu’il était ruiné, si l’ennemi brûlait sa maison. Sa fille, une grande créature pâle, pleurait. Mais, ivre de fatigue, Maurice n’entendait pas, dormait assis, bercé par le trot vif du petit cheval, qui, en moins d’une heure et demie, franchit les quatre lieues, de Vouziers au Chesne. Il n’était pas sept heures, le crépuscule tombait à peine, lorsque le jeune homme, étonné et frissonnant, descendit au pont du canal, sur la place, en face de l’étroite maison jaune où il était né, où il avait passé vingt ans de son existence. C’était là qu’il se rendait machinalement, bien que la maison, depuis dix-huit mois, fût vendue à un vétérinaire. Et, au fermier qui le questionnait, il répondit qu’il savait parfaitement où il allait, il le remercia mille fois de son obligeance.","Along the way, the little farmer kept moaning about the abomination of the times. He had not had the courage to stay at Falaise; and he was already regretting that he was no longer there, repeating that he would be ruined if the enemy burned his house. Her daughter, a tall pale creature, was crying. But, drunk with fatigue, Maurice could not hear, slept seated, rocked by the brisk trot of the little horse, which, in less than an hour and a half, covered the four leagues from Vouziers to Chesne. It was not even seven o'clock, dusk was just falling, when the young man, astonished and shivering, went down to the canal bridge, on the square, opposite the narrow yellow house where he was born, where he had passed twenty years of its existence. It was there that he went mechanically, although the house had been sold to a veterinarian for eighteen months. And, to the farmer who questioned him, he replied that he knew perfectly where he was going, he thanked him a thousand times for his kindness.","On the road the farmer moaned continuously about the times being out of joint. He had not had the courage to stay at Falaise, and now he was already sorry he wasn’t still there, repeating that he was ruined if the enemy set fire to his house. His daughter, a lanky, colourless creature, was snivelling. But Maurice, who was drunk with fatigue, did not hear, for he was asleep on his seat, lulled by the smart trot of the little horse, which covered the four leagues from Vouziers to Le Chêne in under an hour and a half. It was not yet seven, and dusk was hardly setting in when the young man, startled out of sleep and shivering, got down at the canal bridge on to the open space in front of the narrow yellow house where he was born and where he had lived twenty years of his existence. He made for it automatically although the house had been sold eighteen months before to a veterinary surgeon. When the farmer asked him if he could help he answered that he knew quite well where he was going and thanked him very much for his kindness.","As they jogged along the farmer bewailed the terrible times through which they were passing. He had lacked the courage to remain at Falaise, and already was regretting that he had left it, declaring that if the Prussians burned his house it would ruin him. His daughter, a tall, pale young woman, wept copiously. But Maurice was like a dead man for want of sleep, and had no ears for the farmer's lamentations; he slumbered peacefully, soothed by the easy motion of the vehicle, which the little horse trundled over the ground at such a good round pace that it took them less than an hour and a half to accomplish the four leagues between Vouziers and Chene. It was not quite seven o'clock and scarcely beginning to be dark when the young man rubbed his eyes and alighted in a rather dazed condition on the public square, near the bridge over the canal, in front of the modest house where he was born and had passed twenty years of his life. He got down there in obedience to an involuntary impulse, although the house had been sold eighteen months before to a veterinary surgeon, and in reply to the farmer's questions said that he knew quite well where he was going, adding that he was a thousand times obliged to him for his kindness."
"– T’as tort, c’est pas à faire, ces coups-là, parce qu’ensuite les camarades se brossent le ventre.","- You're wrong, it's not to do, these blows, because then the comrades brush their bellies.","‘You’re making a mistake, mate, shouldn’t do things like that because later on your pals ’ll have to tighten their belts.’","“See here, that's no way!"
"– Oh ! moi, n’aie pas peur… J’en ai encore deux.",- Oh ! I don't be afraid... I have two more.,"‘Me? Oh, never you fear… I’ve still got two left.’","“Oh, don't be alarmed about me—I have two left.”"
"Et Jean se retirait, lorsqu’il entendit le major Bouroche, qu’il n’avait pas vu, debout sur le seuil de l’auberge, gronder de sourdes paroles : plus de discipline, plus de punitions, armée fichue ! Avant huit jours, les chefs recevraient des coups de pied au derrière ; tandis que, si l’on avait tout de suite cassé la tête à quelques-uns de ces gaillards, les autres auraient réfléchi peut-être.","And Jean was withdrawing when he heard Major Bouroche, whom he had not seen, standing on the threshold of the inn, growling in muffled words: no more discipline, no more punishments, damn army! Before eight days, the chiefs would receive kicks in the behind; while, if some of these fellows had been banged right away, the others might have thought it over.","Jean was taking himself off when he heard Major Bouroche, whom he had not noticed standing on the steps of the inn, mutter softly: no more discipline, no more punishment, army done for! Before a week was out the officers would get a few kicks up the backside, whereas if they had coshed one or two of those blighters straight away the rest might have had second thoughts.","Jean was walking off, having said all he had to say, when he heard Major Bouroche, whom he had not seen where he was standing in the doorway of the inn, growl in a smothered voice: “No more punishment, an end to discipline, the army gone to the dogs! Before a week is over the scoundrels will be ripe for kicking their officers out of camp, while if a few of them had been made an example of on the spot it might have brought the remainder to their senses.”"
"Cependant, Maurice et Jean, de nouveau, s’accoutumaient ; et, dans l’excès de leur affolement, venait une sorte d’inconscience et de griserie, qui était de la bravoure. Ils finissaient par ne plus même se hâter, au travers du bois maudit. L’horreur s’était encore accrue, parmi ce peuple d’arbres bombardés, tués à leur poste, s’abattant de tous côtés comme des soldats immobiles et géants. Sous les frondaisons, dans le délicieux demi-jour verdâtre, au fond des asiles mystérieux, tapissés de mousse, soufflait la mort brutale. Les sources solitaires étaient violées, des mourants râlaient jusque dans les coins perdus, où des amoureux seuls s’étaient égarés jusque-là. Un homme, la poitrine traversée d’une balle, avait eu le temps de crier « touché ! » en tombant sur la face, mort. Un autre qui venait d’avoir les deux jambes brisées par un obus, continuait à rire, inconscient de sa blessure, croyant simplement s’être heurté contre une racine. D’autres, les membres troués, atteints mortellement, parlaient et couraient encore, pendant plusieurs mètres, avant de culbuter, dans une convulsion brusque. Au premier moment, les plaies les plus profondes se sentaient à peine, et plus tard seulement les effroyables souffrances commençaient, jaillissaient en cris et en larmes.","However, Maurice and Jean once again got used to it; and, in the excess of their panic, came a kind of unconsciousness and exhilaration, which was bravery. They ended up not even hurrying through the cursed wood. The horror had increased still more, among this people of bombarded trees, killed at their post, falling down on all sides like motionless and giant soldiers. Under the foliage, in the delicious greenish half-light, at the bottom of the mysterious asylums, lined with moss, brutal death was blowing. Solitary springs were violated, dying people grumbled even in lost corners, where lovers alone had wandered so far. A man, his chest pierced by a bullet, had had time to shout “hit! falling on his face, dead. Another, who had just had both legs shattered by a shell, continued to laugh, unaware of his injury, believing he had simply run into a root. Others, with holes in their limbs, mortally wounded, still talked and ran for several meters before tumbling over in a sudden convulsion. At the first moment, the deepest wounds were barely felt, and only later the terrible sufferings began, bursting out in cries and tears.","And yet once again Maurice and Jean got used to it, and out of the very excess of their panic there grew a sort of don’t-care intoxication which had something brave about it, and they ended by not even hurrying any more through that accursed wood. The horror had intensified still more among this population of bombarded trees killed at their posts and falling on all sides like steadfast, gigantic soldiers. Under the greenwood tree, in the lovely half-light, down in mysterious bowers carpeted with moss, brutal death passed by. The solitary waterbrooks were violated, dying men gasped their lives away in the most secret nooks where hitherto none but lovers had ventured. One man with a bullet through his chest had time to shout ‘Got me!’ as he fell on his face, dead. Another, both of whose legs had been smashed by a shell, went on laughing, not realizing he was wounded, but thinking he had merely stumbled over a tree-root. Others, with limbs shot through and mortally wounded, went on talking and running for a few steps before collapsing in a sudden spasm. At the first moment even the deepest wounds could hardly be felt, and it was only later that the appalling sufferings began and poured themselves forth in screams and tears.","Maurice and Jean, meanwhile, were becoming somewhat more accustomed to their surroundings, and even when their terror was at its highest there came to them a sort of exalted self-unconsciousness that had in it something of bravery. They finally reached a point when they did not even hasten their steps as they made their way through the accursed wood. The horror of the bombardment was even greater than it had been previously among that race of sylvan denizens, killed at their post, struck down on every hand, like gigantic, faithful sentries. In the delicious twilight that reigned, golden-green, beneath their umbrageous branches, among the mysterious recesses of romantic, moss-carpeted retreats, Death showed his ill-favored, grinning face. The solitary fountains were contaminated; men fell dead in distant nooks whose depths had hitherto been trod by none save wandering lovers. A bullet pierced a man's chest; he had time to utter the one word: “hit!” and fell forward on his face, stone dead. Upon the lips of another, who had both legs broken by a shell, the gay laugh remained; unconscious of his hurt, he supposed he had tripped over a root. Others, injured mortally, would run on for some yards, jesting and conversing, until suddenly they went down like a log in the supreme convulsion. The severest wounds were hardly felt at the moment they were received; it was only at a later period that the terrible suffering commenced, venting itself in shrieks and hot tears."
"– Certainement, messieurs, vous feriez mieux de vous en aller… Nous pouvons être attaqués d’un moment à l’autre.","“Certainly, gentlemen, you had better go away… We may be attacked at any moment.","‘Certainly, gentlemen, you would be well advised to go… We may be attacked at any minute.’","“It will certainly be best for you to go, gentlemen.

"Toute saisie, Silvine, qui venait de reprendre sa couture, s’arrêta, écoutant.","Stunned, Silvine, who had just resumed her sewing, stopped, listening.","Silvine, who had taken up her sewing again, stopped dead and listened.","Silvine, who had resumed her sewing, dropped it in her lap and listened with intense interest."
"Il ne répondit pas, débanda les plaies, les examina en silence, tira des fioles de sa poche et refit un pansement, en montrant à la jeune femme comment on devait s’y prendre. Puis, de sa voix rude, il demanda tout à coup au blessé :","He did not answer, unbandaged the wounds, examined them in silence, took vials from his pocket and re-bandaged it, showing the young woman how to do it. Then, in his rough voice, he suddenly asked the wounded man:","Without answering he took off the bandages and silently examined the wounds, took some phials out of his pocket and made a fresh dressing, showing her how to set about it. Then in his rough way he suddenly asked the patient:","He made no reply, but uncovered the injuries and examined them in silence; then, taking some phials from his pocket, he made a fresh dressing, explaining to the young woman how it was done. When he had finished he turned suddenly to the patient and asked in his loud, rough voice:"
– Adieu ! adieu !,- Goodbye ! goodbye !,"‘Good-bye, good-bye.’",“Farewell! Farewell!”

"– Mes enfants, répétait le colonel en passant parmi ses hommes, nous serons sans doute attaqués cette nuit, ou sûrement demain matin à la pointe du jour… Tenez-vous prêts et rappelez-vous que le 106e n’a jamais reculé.","“My children,” repeated the colonel as he passed among his men, “we will no doubt be attacked tonight, or surely tomorrow morning at daybreak… Get ready and remember that the 106th has never retreated.","‘My boys,’ the colonel kept saying as he moved about among the men, ‘we may be attacked tonight and certainly shall be tomorrow at dawn… Hold yourselves ready and remember that the 106th has never run away.’","“My children,” said the Colonel, as he passed along the line of men, “we shall probably be attacked to-night, or if not, then by day-break to-morrow morning at the latest. Be prepared, and remember that the 106th has never retreated before the enemy.”"
"Le général Douay, alors, pendant que l’artillerie ennemie préparait de la sorte l’attaque suprême du calvaire, résolut de faire un dernier effort pour le reconquérir. Il envoya des ordres, il se jeta en personne parmi les fuyards de la division Dumont, réussit à former une colonne, qu’il lança sur le plateau. Elle y tint bon pendant quelques minutes ; mais les balles sifflaient si drues, une telle trombe d’obus balayait les champs vides, sans un arbre, que la panique tout de suite se déclara, remportant les hommes le long des pentes, les roulant ainsi que des pailles surprises par un orage. Et le général s’entêta, fit avancer d’autres régiments.","General Douay then, while the enemy artillery was thus preparing the supreme attack on Calvary, resolved to make a last effort to reconquer it. He sent orders, he threw himself in person among the fugitives of Dumont's division, succeeded in forming a column, which he launched onto the plateau. She held out for a few minutes; but the bullets whistled so thickly, such a whirlwind of shells swept over the empty fields, without a tree, that panic immediately broke out, carrying the men along the slopes, rolling them like straw caught in a storm. And the general stubbornly pushed other regiments forward.","Then, as the enemy artillery was thus preparing for the final attack on the Calvary, General Douay made up his mind to make a last effort to recapture it. He dispatched orders, threw himself in person into the midst of the fugitives from the Dumont division, succeeded in forming a column which he hurled on to the plateau. It held good for several minutes, but the bullets were whistling by so thick and fast, and such a storm of shells was sweeping over the bare fields that panic broke out at once, throwing the men back down the slopes, bowling them along like wisps of straw blown by a sudden squall. The general obstinately sent in more regiments.","Then General Douay, while the German artillery was thus preparing the way for the decisive movement that should make them masters of the Calvary, resolved to make one last desperate attempt to regain possession of the hill. He dispatched his orders, and throwing himself in person among the fugitives of Dumont's division, succeeded in forming a column which he sent forward to the plateau. It held its ground for a few minutes, but the bullets whistled so thick, the naked, treeless fields were swept by such a tornado of shot and shell, that it was not long before the panic broke out afresh, sweeping the men adown the slopes, rolling them up as straws are whirled before the wind. And the general, unwilling to abandon his project, ordered up other regiments."
"– Jamais ils ne tiendront, c’est foutu !","– They will never last, it’s screwed!","‘They’ll never hold out, we’re done for!’",“They will have to give it up!
"Enfin, on était hors de ce bois d’épouvante. Avec Maurice et Jean, il ne restait de la petite bande que le lieutenant Rochas, Pache et Lapoulle. Gaude, qu’on avait perdu, sortit à son tour d’un fourré, galopa pour rejoindre les camarades, son clairon pendu à l’épaule. Et c’était un vrai soulagement, de se retrouver en rase campagne, respirant à l’aise. Le sifflement des balles avait cessé, les obus ne tombaient pas, de ce côté du vallon.","Finally, we were out of this wood of dread. With Maurice and Jean, only Lieutenant Rochas, Pache and Lapoulle remained of the little band. Gaude, who had been lost, emerged in turn from a thicket, galloped to rejoin the comrades, his bugle slung over his shoulder. And it was a real relief, to be in open country, breathing easy. The whistle of the bullets had ceased, the shells were not falling on this side of the valley.","At last they were out of this fearful wood. Apart from Maurice and Jean there only remained out of the little group Lieutenant Rochas, Pache and Lapoulle. Gaude, whom they had lost, emerged in his turn from a thicket and ran to rejoin his mates, with his bugle slung over his shoulder. It was a real relief to find themselves in open country and breathing freely. The whistling of bullets had stopped, and shells were not coming down on this side of the valley.","At last they had left the wood and its horrors behind them. Beside Maurice and Jean all that were left of the little band were Lieutenant Rochas, Lapoulle and Pache. Gaude, who had strayed away from his companions, presently came running from a thicket to rejoin them, his bugle hanging from his neck and thumping against his back with every step he took. It was a great comfort to them all to find themselves once again in the open country, where they could draw their breath; and then, too, there were no longer any whistling bullets and crashing shells to harass them; the firing had ceased on this side of the valley."
"Au bout d’un silence, Delaherche, qui regardait à la fenêtre le jour grandir, se retourna vivement, pour dire aux deux soldats :","After a silence, Delaherche, who was watching the day grow at the window, turned quickly to say to the two soldiers:","After a pause Delaherche, who had been at the window watching it getting lighter, turned round quickly to say to the two soldiers:","After a time, during which no word was spoken, Delaherche, who had been standing at the window watching the growing day, suddenly turned and addressed the two soldiers:"
"Tandis que Maurice lisait la lettre, les mains de l’artilleur tremblaient. C’était une lettre de Silvine, la première, la seule qu’elle lui eût jamais écrite. À quel sentiment avait-elle obéi, cette soumise, cette silencieuse, dont les beaux yeux noirs prenaient parfois une fixité de résolution extraordinaire, dans son continuel servage ? Elle disait simplement qu’elle le savait à la guerre et que, si elle ne devait pas le revoir, cela lui faisait trop de peine de penser qu’il pouvait mourir, en croyant qu’elle ne l’aimait plus. Elle l’aimait toujours, jamais elle n’avait aimé que lui ; et elle répétait cela pendant quatre pages, en phrases qui revenaient pareilles, sans chercher d’excuses, sans tâcher même d’expliquer ce qui s’était passé. Et pas un mot de l’enfant, et rien qu’un adieu d’une infinie tendresse.","As Maurice read the letter, the gunner's hands were shaking. It was a letter from Silvine, the first, the only one she had ever written to him. What feeling had she obeyed, this submissive, this silent woman, whose beautiful black eyes sometimes took on an extraordinary fixity of resolution, in her continual serfdom? She said simply that she knew him in the war and that if she were not to see him again, it pained her too much to think that he might die, believing that she no longer loved him. She always loved him, she had never loved anyone but him; and she repeated this for four pages, in phrases that came back the same, without looking for excuses, without even trying to explain what had happened. And not a word from the child, and nothing but an infinite tender farewell.","While Maurice was reading the letter Honoré’s hands were trembling. The letter was from Silvine and it was the first and only one she had ever sent him. What emotion had stirred this submissive, silent girl, whose beautiful dark eyes would sometimes take on an expression of extraordinarily fixed determination in her life of continual service? She simply wrote that she knew he was at the war and that should she never see him again it hurt her too much to think he might die believing she didn’t love him. She still loved him, she had never loved anybody else, and she repeated this for four pages in the same sentences that came back again and again, with no attempt to find excuses or even to explain what had happened. And not a word about the child, nothing but an infinitely sad good-bye.","The artilleryman's hands shook with agitation as Maurice perused the letter. It was from Silvine, the first, the only one that she had ever written him. What had been her guiding impulse, that silent, submissive woman, whose handsome black eyes at times manifested a startling fixedness of purpose in the midst of her never-ending slavery? She simply said that she knew he was with the army, and though she might never see him again, she could not endure the thought that he might die and believe that she had ceased to love him. She loved him still, had never loved another; and this she repeated again and again through four closely written pages, in words of unvarying import, without the slightest word of excuse for herself, without even attempting to explain what had happened. There was no mention of the child, nothing but an infinitely mournful and tender farewell."
"Dès que le général aperçut Sambuc, il cria :","As soon as the general saw Sambuc, he shouted:",As soon as the general saw Sambuc he bawled:,"“A beastly country this, with its everlasting hills and woods!” the general shouted, as soon as he caught sight of Sambuc."
"Ce fut ainsi que Jean se trouva en arrière, égaré au fond d’un chemin creux, avec son escouade, qu’il n’avait pas voulu lâcher. Le 106e avait disparu, plus un homme ni même un officier de la compagnie. Il n’y avait là que des soldats isolés, un pêle-mêle d’inconnus, éreintés dès le commencement de l’étape, chacun marchant à son loisir, au hasard des sentiers. Le soleil était accablant, il faisait très chaud ; et le sac, alourdi par la tente et le matériel compliqué qui le gonflait, pesait terriblement aux épaules. Beaucoup n’avaient point l’habitude de le porter, gênés déjà dans l’épaisse capote de campagne, pareille à une chape de plomb. Brusquement, un petit soldat pâle, les yeux emplis d’eau, s’arrêta, jeta son sac dans un fossé, avec un grand soupir, le souffle fort de l’homme à l’agonie qui se reprend à l’existence.","It was thus that Jean found himself behind, lost at the bottom of a sunken road, with his squad, which he had not wanted to let go. The 106th had disappeared, not a man or even an officer of the company. There were only isolated soldiers there, a pell-mell of strangers, exhausted from the beginning of the stage, each walking at his leisure, at random along the paths. The sun was oppressive, it was very hot; and the bag, weighed down by the tent and the complicated stuff that inflated it, weighed terribly on the shoulders. Many were not used to wearing it, already embarrassed in the thick country greatcoat, like a leaden screed. Suddenly a pale little soldier, his eyes filled with water, stopped, threw his bag into a ditch, with a great sigh, the strong breath of a dying man coming back to life.","So it was that Jean found himself in the rear, lost in a sunken lane with his squad, that he was determined not to let out of his sight. The 106th had vanished and there was not a single man or even officer of the company left. There were only isolated soldiers, a mob of unknown men, worn out at the very start of the day’s march, each going at his own pace wherever the paths took him. The sun was killing, it was terribly hot, and their packs, made heavier by the tents and complicated gear which distended them, weighed cruelly on their shoulders. Many of them were unaccustomed to carrying a pack, and in any case they were hampered by their thick service capes that felt as though they were made of lead. All of a sudden a pallid young soldier, whose eyes were filled with tears, stopped and threw his kit into a ditch with a heavy sigh of relief, like the deep breathing of a dying man coming back to life.","Thus it happened that Jean found himself away at the rear, lost in a sunken road, together with his squad, whom he had been unwilling to abandon. The 106th had disappeared, nor was there a man or an officer of their company in sight. About them were soldiers, singly or in little groups, from all the regiments, a weary, foot-sore crew, knocked up at the beginning of the retreat, each man straggling on at his own sweet will whithersoever the path that he was on might chance to lead him. The sun beat down fiercely, the heat was stifling, and the knapsack, loaded as it was with the tent and implements of every description, made a terrible burden on the shoulders of the exhausted men. To many of them the experience was an entirely new one, and the heavy great-coats they wore seemed to them like vestments of lead. The first to set an example for the others was a little pale faced soldier with watery eyes; he drew beside the road and let his knapsack slide off into the ditch, heaving a deep sigh as he did so, the long drawn breath of a dying man who feels himself coming back to life."

"Delaherche partit, en expliquant qu’il allait revenir tout de suite, avec des renseignements certains. Dès la rue Maqua, il fut surpris du nombre de soldats qui rentraient, sans armes, l’uniforme en lambeaux, souillé de poussière. Il ne put d’ailleurs tirer aucun détail précis de ceux qu’il s’efforça d’interroger : les uns répondaient, hébétés, qu’ils ne savaient pas ; les autres en disaient si long, dans une telle furie de gestes, une telle exaltation de paroles, qu’ils ressemblaient à des fous. Machinalement, alors, il se dirigea de nouveau vers la Sous-Préfecture, avec la pensée que toutes les nouvelles affluaient là. Comme il traversait la place du Collège, deux canons, sans doute les deux seules pièces qui restaient d’une batterie, arrivèrent au galop, s’échouèrent contre un trottoir. Dans la Grande-Rue, il dut s’avouer que la ville commençait à s’encombrer des premiers fuyards : trois hussards démontés, assis sous une porte, se partageaient un pain ; deux autres, à petits pas, menaient leurs chevaux par la bride, ignorant à quelle écurie les conduire ; des officiers couraient éperdus, sans avoir l’air de savoir où ils allaient. Sur la place Turenne, un sous-lieutenant lui conseilla de ne pas s’attarder, car des obus y tombaient fréquemment, un éclat venait même d’y briser la grille qui entourait la statue du grand capitaine, vainqueur du Palatinat. Et, en effet, comme il filait rapidement dans la rue de la Sous-Préfecture, il vit deux projectiles éclater, avec un fracas épouvantable, sur le pont de Meuse.","Delaherche left, explaining that he would return immediately, with certain information. From Maqua Street, he was surprised by the number of soldiers returning, unarmed, their uniforms in tatters, soiled with dust. Moreover, he could not extract any precise details from those whom he endeavored to question: some replied, dazed, that they did not know; the others said so much, in such fury of gesture, such exaltation of speech, that they looked like madmen. Mechanically, then, he headed back to the Sub-Prefecture, thinking that all the news flowed there. As he crossed the Place du College, two guns, doubtless the only two guns that remained of a battery, arrived at a gallop, ran aground against a pavement. In the Grande-Rue, he had to admit to himself that the town was beginning to be encumbered with the first fugitives: three dismounted hussars, seated under a door, shared a loaf of bread; two others, with short steps, led their horses by the bridle, not knowing which stable to lead them to; officers were running wildly, without seeming to know where they were going. On the place Turenne, a second lieutenant advised him not to linger, because shells fell there frequently, a splinter had even just broken the grid which surrounded the statue of the great captain, conqueror of the Palatinate. And, in fact, as he was speeding along the rue de la Sous-Prefecture, he saw two projectiles burst, with a terrible crash, on the bridge of the Meuse.","Delaherche went off, saying he would be back in a moment with definite news. Even in the rue Maqua he was surprised by the number of soldiers coming back with no weapons, their uniforms in tatters and filthy with dust. But he could not get any exact details out of those he took the trouble to question: some answered in a daze that they didn’t know, others talked so much and with such a frenzy of gesture and extravagance of words that they might have been mad. So he instinctively made for the Sub-Prefecture again, with the idea that all the news went there. As he was crossing the Place du Collège two cannons, probably the only two left out of a battery, dashed up and were stopped by a kerbstone. In the Grande-Rue he had to admit that the town was beginning to get overcrowded with the first fugitives. Three hussars who had lost their horses were sitting in a doorway and sharing a loaf, two others were slowly leading their horses along by the bridle with no idea where to stable them, officers were frantically running hither and thither, apparently not knowing where they were making for. On the Place Turenne a second lieutenant advised him not to hang about because quite a few shells were coming down, and a fragment had even broken the railing surrounding the statue of the Great Captain, conqueror of the Palatinate. And indeed, as he slipped quickly along the rue de la Sous-Préfecture, he saw two projectiles burst with a terrific noise on the Meuse bridge.","Delaherche left them, with the assurance that he would be away no longer than was necessary to ascertain the true condition of affairs. In the Rue Maqua he was surprised to observe the crowds of soldiers that were streaming into the city, without arms and in torn, dust-stained uniforms. It was in vain, however, that he endeavored to slake his thirst for news by questioning them; some answered with vacant, stupid looks that they knew nothing, while others told long rambling stories, with the maniacal gestures and whirling words of one bereft of reason. He therefore mechanically turned his steps again toward the Sous Prefecture as the likeliest quarter in which to look for information. As he was passing along the Place du College two guns, probably all that remained of some battery, came dashing up to the curb on a gallop, and were abandoned there. When at last he turned into the Grande Rue he had further evidence that the advanced guards of the fugitives were beginning to take possession, of the city; three dismounted hussars had seated themselves in a doorway and were sharing a loaf of bread; two others were walking their mounts up and down, leading them by the bridle, not knowing where to look for stabling for them; officers were hurrying to and fro distractedly, seemingly without any distinct purpose. On the Place Turenne a lieutenant counseled him not to loiter unnecessarily, for the shells had an unpleasant way of dropping there every now and then; indeed, a splinter had just demolished the railing about the statue of the great commander who overran the Palatinate. And as if to emphasize the officer's advice, while he was making fast time down the Rue de la Sous Prefecture he saw two projectiles explode, with a terrible crash, on the Pont de Meuse."
"Alors, dans l’entêtement héroïque, lorsque la troisième charge se produisit, Prosper se trouva mêlé à des hussards et à des chasseurs de France. Les régiments se confondaient, ce n’était plus qu’une vague énorme qui se brisait et se reformait sans cesse, pour remporter tout ce qu’elle rencontrait. Il n’avait plus notion de rien, il s’abandonnait à son cheval, ce brave Zéphir qu’il aimait tant et qu’une blessure à l’oreille semblait affoler. Maintenant, il était au centre, d’autres chevaux se cabraient, se renversaient autour de lui, des hommes étaient jetés à terre, comme par un coup de vent, tandis que d’autres, tués raides, restaient en selle, chargeaient toujours, les paupières vides. Et, cette fois, derrière les deux cents mètres que l’on gagna de nouveau, les chaumes reparurent couverts de morts et de mourants. Il y en avait dont la tête s’était enfoncée en terre. D’autres, tombés sur le dos, regardaient le soleil avec des yeux de terreur, sortis des orbites. Puis, c’était un grand cheval noir, un cheval d’officier, le ventre ouvert et qui tâchait vainement de se remettre debout, les deux pieds de devant pris dans ses entrailles. Sous le feu qui redoublait, les ailes tourbillonnèrent une fois encore, se replièrent pour revenir acharnées.","So, in heroic stubbornness, when the third charge came, Prosper found himself mixed up with hussars and chasseurs de France. The regiments merged, it was nothing more than an enormous wave which broke and re-formed ceaselessly, to win all that it encountered. He no longer had any idea of anything, he abandoned himself to his horse, this brave Zéphir whom he loved so much and whom an ear injury seemed to panic. Now he was in the middle, other horses were rearing and overturning around him, men were thrown to the ground, as if by a gust of wind, while others, killed stiff, remained in the saddle, still charging, empty eyelids. And this time, behind the two hundred yards which they gained again, the stubble fields reappeared covered with the dead and dying. There were some whose heads had sunk into the ground. Others, fallen on their backs, looked at the sun with eyes of terror, out of their sockets. Then there was a big black horse, an officer's horse, its belly open and trying in vain to get back on its feet, its two front feet caught in its entrails. Under the redoubled fire, the wings whirled once more, folded back to return fiercely.","Then, in the heroic determination of the third charge, Prosper found himself involved with hussars and French chasseurs. Regiments no longer meant anything, and now there was simply an enormous wave continually breaking and re-forming to carry away all it met. He no longer had any notion of what was happening, but abandoned himself to his horse, that good old Zephir he loved so much and who seemed to have been driven crazy by a wounded ear. He was in the centre now, other horses were rearing and falling round him, some men were thrown to the ground as though they were blown down, while others, killed instantly, were still in the saddle, still charging with unseeing eyes. And this time, behind the two hundred fresh metres gained, the fields came back into view covered with dead and dying. There were some with their heads rammed into the ground. Others had fallen on their backs and were staring at the sun with terrified eyes starting from their sockets. There was a big black horse, with its belly open and vainly trying to get back on to its feet because its legs were caught in its entrails. Under the increasing fire the wings turned about yet again and gathered themselves together for another furious return.","When for the third time the men were called upon to charge and responded with invincible heroism, Prosper found that his companions were principally hussars and chasseurs de France. Regiments and squadrons, as organizations, had ceased to exist; their constituent elements were drops in the mighty wave that alternately broke and reared its crest again, to swallow up all that lay in its destructive path. He had long since lost distinct consciousness of what was going on around him, and suffered his movements to be guided by his mount, faithful Zephyr, who had received a wound in the ear that seemed to madden him. He was now in the center, where all about him horses were rearing, pawing the air, and falling backward; men were dismounted as if torn from their saddle by the blast of a tornado, while others, shot through some vital part, retained their seat and rode onward in the ranks with vacant, sightless eyes. And looking back over the additional two hundred yards that this effort had won for them, they could see the field of yellow stubble strewn thick with dead and dying. Some there were who had fallen headlong from their saddle and buried their face in the soft earth. Others had alighted on their back and were staring up into the sun with terror-stricken eyes that seemed bursting from their sockets. There was a handsome black horse, an officer's charger, that had been disemboweled, and was making frantic efforts to rise, his fore feet entangled in his entrails. Beneath the fire, that became constantly more murderous as they drew nearer, the survivors in the wings wheeled their horses and fell back to concentrate their strength for a fresh onset."
– Chargez !,– Charge!,‘Charge!’,“Charge!”
"D’un mot, le roi avait demandé un renseignement. Sur l’échiquier colossal, il voulait savoir et tenir dans sa main cette poussière d’hommes qu’il commandait. À sa droite, un vol d’hirondelles, effrayées par le canon, tourbillonna, s’enleva très haut, se perdit vers le sud.","With a word, the king had asked for information. On the colossal chessboard, he wanted to know and hold in his hand this dust of men he commanded. To his right, a flock of swallows, frightened by the cannon, whirled around, soared high, lost themselves to the south.","The King had asked briefly for some bit of information. On the colossal chessboard he wanted to know everything and keep a hand on this multitude of men under his command. To his right a flight of swallows, scared by the gunfire, wheeled upwards very high and was lost to sight in the south.","Turning to his staff, the King briefly called for information upon some point. It was the royal will to direct each move on the gigantic chessboard; to hold in the hollow of his hand the hosts who looked to him for guidance. At his left, a flock of swallows, affrighted by the noise of the cannonade, rose high in air, wheeled, and vanished in the south."
"– Votre sœur, c’est vrai !… Elle m’accompagnait, c’était elle qui portait les deux pains. Seulement, elle a dû rester là-bas, de l’autre côté du canal. Jamais le poste n’a consenti à la laisser passer… Vous savez que les Prussiens ont rigoureusement interdit aux femmes l’entrée de la presqu’île.","""Your sister, it's true!... She accompanied me, it was she who carried the two loaves. Only she had to stay over there, on the other side of the canal. The post never consented to let her pass... You know that the Prussians strictly prohibited women from entering the peninsula.","‘Oh yes, of course, your sister… She came with me and she carried the two loaves. But she had to stay there on the other side of the canal. The guards would never agree to let her pass… You know the Prussians have absolutely prohibited women from coming into the peninsula.’","“Ah, yes! your sister; true. She insisted on coming with me; it was she who brought the two loaves of bread. She had to remain over yonder, though, on the other side of the canal; the sentries wouldn't let her pass the gate.

"Un dimanche de la fin septembre, Maurice fut envoyé en corvée, à l’autre bout de la ville, et les rues qu’il suivit, les places qu’il traversa, l’emplirent d’une nouvelle espérance. Depuis la déroute de Châtillon, il lui semblait que les cœurs s’étaient haussés pour la grande besogne. Ah ! ce Paris qu’il avait connu si âpre à jouir, si près des dernières fautes, il le retrouvait simple, d’une bravoure gaie, ayant accepté tous les sacrifices. On ne rencontrait que des uniformes, les plus désintéressés portaient un képi de garde national. Comme une horloge géante dont le ressort éclate, la vie sociale s’était arrêtée brusquement, l’industrie, le commerce, les affaires ; et il ne restait qu’une passion, la volonté de vaincre, l’unique sujet dont on parlait, qui enflammait les cœurs et les têtes, dans les réunions publiques, pendant les veillées des corps de garde, parmi les continuels attroupements de foule barrant les trottoirs. Ainsi mises en commun, les illusions emportaient les âmes, une tension jetait ce peuple au danger des folies généreuses. C’était déjà toute une crise de nervosité maladive qui se déclarait, une épidémique fièvre exagérant la peur comme la confiance, lâchant la bête humaine débridée, au moindre souffle. Et Maurice assista, rue des Martyrs, à une scène qui le passionna : tout un assaut, une bande furieuse se ruant contre une maison dont on avait vu une des fenêtres hautes, la nuit entière, éclairée d’une vive clarté de lampe, un évident signal aux Prussiens de Bellevue, par-dessus Paris. Des bourgeois hantés vivaient sur leurs toits, pour surveiller les environs. La veille, on avait voulu noyer dans le bassin des Tuileries un misérable qui consultait un plan de la ville, ouvert sur un banc.","One Sunday at the end of September, Maurice was sent on duty to the other end of the city, and the streets he followed, the squares he crossed, filled him with new hope. Since the rout of Châtillon, it seemed to him that hearts had risen for the great task. Ah! this Paris which he had known so hard to enjoy, so close to the last faults, he found it simple, of a cheerful bravery, having accepted all the sacrifices. We met only uniforms, the most disinterested wore a National Guard cap. Like a giant clock whose spring bursts, social life had come to a sudden stop, industry, commerce, business; and there remained only one passion, the will to conquer, the only subject of which they spoke, which inflamed hearts and sidewalks. Thus pooled, the illusions carried away souls, a tension threw this people into the danger of generous follies. It was already a whole fit of unhealthy nervousness that was breaking out, an epidemic fever exaggerating both fear and confidence, unleashing the unbridled human beast at the slightest breath. And Maurice witnessed, in the rue des Martyrs, a scene which fascinated him: a whole assault, a furious mob rushing against a house of which one of the high windows had been seen, all night long, lit up with a bright light from a lamp, a obvious signal to the Prussians of Bellevue, above Paris. Haunted bourgeois lived on their roofs, watching the surroundings. The day before, they had wanted to drown in the basin of the Tuileries a wretch who was consulting a map of the city, lying open on a bench.","One Sunday in late September Maurice was sent on fatigue duty right across the city, and the streets he went along and the open spaces he crossed filled him with new hope. Since the rout at Châtillon he felt that courage had risen to face the great task. Yes, the Paris he had known, so mad on pleasure and so near to giving itself up to the foulest vices, was now, he found, simple again, brave and cheerful, accepting any sacrifice. You saw nothing but uniforms, and even the least involved wore the képi of the National Guard. As a huge clock stops when the spring breaks, so social life had suddenly come to an end, and with it industry, commerce, business, leaving only one passion, to win through, and it was the only subject of conversation that inflamed all hearts and heads in public gatherings, during the watches in the guardroom and among the crowds continually blocking the pavements. Shared in common, illusions carried people’s souls away and excitement flung them into the dangers of impetuous heroics. Already a crisis of unhealthy excitability was approaching a sort of epidemic fever, magnifying fear just as much as confidence and letting loose the human herd to rush off unbridled at the slightest stimulus. In the rue des Martyrs Maurice witnessed a scene which worked him up into a frenzy – a mass assault, a furious mob hurling itself upon a house where, at one of the upper windows, a brilliant lamp had been seen burning all night, obviously a signal flashed above Paris to the Prussians at Bellevue. Citizens felt compelled to live on their roofs so as to keep an eye on the surrounding country. On the previous day they had tried to drown in the round pond in the Tuileries some wretched person who was looking at a town plan he had unfolded on a seat.","On a Sunday toward the end of September Maurice was detailed to carry a message to the further end of the city, and what he witnessed along the streets he passed through filled him with new hope. Ever since the defeat of Chatillon it had seemed to him that the courage of the people was rising to a level with the great task that lay before them. Ah! that Paris that he had known so thoughtless, so wayward, so keen in the pursuit of pleasure; he found it now quite changed, simple, earnest, cheerfully brave, ready for every sacrifice. Everyone was in uniform; there was scarce a head that was not decorated with the kepi of the National Guard. Business of every sort had come to a sudden standstill, as the hands of a watch cease to move when the mainspring snaps, and at the public meetings, among the soldiers in the guard-room, or where the crowds collected in the streets, there was but one subject of conversation, inflaming the hearts and minds of all—the determination to conquer. The contagious influence of illusion, scattered broadcast, unbalanced weaker minds; the people were tempted to acts of generous folly by the tension to which they were subjected. Already there was a taint of morbid, nervous excitability in the air, a feverish condition in which men's hopes and fears alike became distorted and exaggerated, arousing the worst passions of humanity at the slightest breath of suspicion. And Maurice was witness to a scene in the Rue des Martyrs that produced a profound impression on him, the assault made by a band of infuriated men on a house from which, at one of the upper windows, a bright light had been displayed all through the night, a signal, evidently, intended to reach the Prussians at Bellevue over the roofs of Paris. There were jealous citizens who spent all their nights on their house-tops, watching what was going on around them. The day before a poor wretch had had a narrow escape from drowning at the hands of the mob, merely because he had opened a map of the city on a bench in the Tuileries gardens and consulted it."
"– Oh ! moi, dit brusquement le sergent Sapin à Jean et à Maurice, je serai tué aujourd’hui.","- Oh ! I, said Sergeant Sapin abruptly to Jean and Maurice, I will be killed today.","‘Oh well,’ Sergeant Sapin said in his matter-of-fact way to Jean and Maurice, ‘I shall be killed today.’","“Oh! I,” said Sergeant Sapin with a start, addressing Jean and Maurice, “I shall be killed to-day.”"
"Il n’entra pas, mais il allongea le cou et il hocha la tête, en apercevant le gamin dans un lit très blanc, la face empourprée de fièvre, et qui regardait fixement sa mère de ses yeux de flamme.","He did not come in, but he craned his neck and nodded, seeing the boy in a very white bed, his face flushed with fever, and staring at his mother with his blazing eyes.","He did not go in, but craned his neck and shook his head on seeing the lad in a spotlessly clean bed, his face flushed with fever, staring at his mother with burning eyes.","He did not enter, but glanced into the apartment from the threshold, and shook his head sorrowfully at sight of the little fellow in his clean, white bed, his face exhibiting the scarlet hue of the disease, and his glassy, burning eyes bent wistfully on his mother."
"Des hommes de la compagnie, en voyant tomber leur capitaine, se soulevèrent ; et, comme il appelait à l’aide, suppliant qu’on l’emportât, Jean finit par courir jusqu’à lui, suivi aussitôt de Maurice.","Men of the company, seeing their captain fall, rose up; and, as he called for help, begging to be taken away, Jean ended by running up to him, followed immediately by Maurice.","What you’ve got coming to you, comes.’ The men of his company, seeing their captain fall, leaped up, and as he was crying for help and begging to be taken away, Jean also ran over to him and Maurice after him.","Some members of the company had risen to their feet on seeing their captain fall, and as he continued to call lustily for assistance, Jean finally ran to him, immediately followed by Maurice."
"Il s’était mis à rire, plein de simplicité. Il ajouta :","He began to laugh, full of simplicity. He added :","He began to laugh in his open-hearted way, and added:",He laughed with frank simplicity and added:
"– Mais, monsieur, vous qui savez tout, vous ne savez pas ça… Oui, à Mazagran, j’avais dix-neuf ans à peine, et nous étions cent vingt-trois hommes, pas un de plus, et nous avons tenu quatre jours contre douze mille Arabes… Ah ! oui, pendant des années et des années, là-bas, en Afrique, à Mascara, à Biskra, à Dellys, plus tard dans la grande Kabylie, plus tard à Laghouat, si vous aviez été avec nous, monsieur, vous auriez vu tous ces sales moricauds filer comme des lièvres, dès que nous paraissions… Et à Sébastopol, monsieur, fichtre ! on ne peut pas dire que ç’a été commode. Des tempêtes à vous déraciner les cheveux, un froid de loup, toujours des alertes, puis ces sauvages qui, à la fin, ont tout fait sauter ! N’empêche pas que nous les avons fait sauter eux-mêmes, oh ! en musique et dans la grande poêle à frire !… Et à Solférino, vous n’y étiez pas, monsieur, alors pourquoi en parlez-vous ? Oui, à Solférino, où il a fait si chaud, bien qu’il ait tombé ce jour-là plus d’eau que vous n’en avez peut-être jamais vu dans votre vie ! à Solférino, la grande brossée aux Autrichiens, il fallait les voir, devant nos baïonnettes, galoper, se culbuter, pour courir plus vite, comme s’ils avaient eu le feu au derrière !","“But, sir, you who know everything, you don't know that… Yes, at Mazagran, I was barely nineteen, and we were a hundred and twenty-three men, not one more, and we held out four days against twelve thousand Arabs… Ah! yes, for years and years, over there, in Africa, in Mascara, in Biskra, in Dellys, later in the great Kabylia, later in Laghouat, if you had been with us, sir, you would have seen all those filthy moricauds slipping away like hares as soon as we appeared... And in Sebastopol, sir, damn it! can't say it was convenient. Storms to uproot your hair, bitter cold, always alerts, then those savages who, in the end, blew everything up! Doesn't prevent us from blowing them up themselves, oh! to music and in the big frying pan!... And at Solferino, you weren't there, sir, so why are you talking about it? Yes, in Solferino, where it was so hot, although more water fell that day than you may have ever seen in your life! at Solferino, the great brush with the Austrians, you had to see them, in front of our bayonets, galloping, tumbling, to run faster, as if they had had fire behind them!","‘But this is something you don’t know about, Mr Knowall… Yes, at Mazagran I was hardly nineteen and we were a hundred and twenty-three men, not one more, and we held out for four days against twelve thousand Arabs… Oh yes, for years and years in Africa, at Mascara, Biskra, Dellys and later on the Grande Kabylie and later still Laghouat, if you had been with us, Mister, you would have seen all those bloody wogs bunking off like hares as soon as we came on the scene… And at Sebastopol, sir, blimey, you couldn’t say that was a picnic either. Gales fit to blow your hair off, perishing cold, constant alerts, and then those savages ended by making everything hop! But never mind, we made them hop too, oh yes, with music and in a big frying-pan, what’s more!… And Solferino, you weren’t there yourself, sir, so why do you talk about it? Yes, at Solferino, where it was so hot although more rain had come down that day than you have seen in your life, perhaps – at Solferino the thrashing we gave those Austrians – you should have seen them galloping away from our bayonets, going arse over tip to run faster, as if they had fire in their backsides.’","“You, sir, who think you know everything, let me tell you a thing you don't know. Yes, at Mazagran I was scarce nineteen years old, and there were twenty-three of us, not a living soul more, and for more than four days we held out against twelve thousand Arabs. Yes, indeed! for years and years, if you had only been with us out there in Africa, sir, at Mascara, at Biskra, at Dellys, after that in Grand Kabylia, after that again at Laghouat, you would have seen those dirty niggers run like deer as soon as we showed our faces. And at Sebastopol, sir, fichtre! you wouldn't have said it was the pleasantest place in the world. The wind blew fit to take a man's hair out by the roots, it was cold enough to freeze a brass monkey, and those beggars kept us on a continual dance with their feints and sorties. Never mind; we made them dance in the end; we danced them into the big hot frying pan, and to quick music, too! And Solferino, you were not there, sir! then why do you speak of it? Yes, at Solferino, where it was so hot, although I suppose more rain fell there that day than you have seen in your whole life, at Solferino, where we had our little brush with the Austrians, it would have warmed your heart to see how they vanished before our bayonets, riding one another down in their haste to get away from us, as if their coat tails were on fire!”"
"Et ce furent alors, jusqu’au milieu de décembre, les journées les plus frissonnantes, les plus navrées de leur solitude. Le froid était devenu si intense, que le poêle n’arrivait pas à chauffer la grande pièce nue. Quand ils regardaient par la fenêtre la neige épaisse qui couvrait le sol, ils songeaient à Maurice, enseveli, là-bas, dans ce Paris glacé et mort, dont ils n’avaient aucune nouvelle certaine. Toujours, les mêmes questions revenaient : que faisait-il, pourquoi ne donnait-il aucun signe de vie ? Ils n’osaient se dire leurs affreuses craintes, une blessure, une maladie, la mort peut-être. Les quelques renseignements vagues qui continuaient à leur parvenir par les journaux, n’étaient point faits pour les rassurer. Après de prétendues sorties heureuses, démenties sans cesse, le bruit avait couru d’une grande victoire, remportée le 2 décembre, à Champigny, par le général Ducrot ; mais ils surent ensuite que, dès le lendemain, abandonnant les positions conquises, il s’était vu forcé de repasser la Marne. C’était, à chaque heure, Paris étranglé d’un lien plus étroit, la famine commençante, la réquisition des pommes de terre après celle des bêtes à cornes, le gaz refusé aux particuliers, bientôt les rues noires, sillonnées par le vol rouge des obus. Et tous deux ne se chauffaient plus, ne mangeaient plus, sans être hantés par l’image de Maurice et de ces deux millions de vivants, enfermés dans cette tombe géante.","And these were then, until the middle of December, the most shivering days, the most saddened by their solitude. The cold had become so intense that the stove could not heat the large bare room. When they looked out the window at the thick snow that covered the ground, they thought of Maurice, buried down there, in that frozen and dead Paris, of which they had no certain news. Always, the same questions came back: what was he doing, why was he giving no sign of life? They dared not tell each other their dreadful fears, an injury, an illness, perhaps death. The few vague pieces of information which continued to reach them through the newspapers were not calculated to reassure them. After supposedly successful sorties, constantly denied, the rumor had spread of a great victory, won on December 2, at Champigny, by General Ducrot; but then they learned that the very next day, abandoning the conquered positions, he had been forced to recross the Marne. It was, every hour, Paris strangled by a closer bond, the beginning famine, the requisition of potatoes after that of horned animals, gas refused to individuals, soon the streets black, furrowed by the red flight shells. And both no longer warmed themselves, no longer ate, without being haunted by the image of Maurice and these two million living people, locked up in this giant tomb.","The days from then until the middle of December were the most disturbing and miserable of their solitude. The cold had become so intense that the stove could not heat the big, empty room. When they looked out of the window at the deep snow on the ground they thought of Maurice buried in a frozen, dead Paris, from which there was no reliable news. They always came back to the same questions. What was he doing? Why didn’t he give any sign of life? They dared not express their awful fears, a wound, sickness, perhaps death. The few odd bits of information that still came through to them in the papers were not calculated to reassure them. After claims of successful sorties, which were always proved false, there had been a rumour of a great victory won on 2 December at Champigny by General Ducrot, but later they knew that the very next day he had abandoned the conquered positions and been forced to recross the Marne. Every hour Paris was being held in a tighter stranglehold, famine was setting in, with potatoes being requisitioned as well as cattle, private people’s gas turned off and soon the streets in darkness, a darkness only streaked by the red paths of shells. Now the two of them could not warm themselves or eat anything without being haunted by a vision of Maurice and two million living souls shut up in that gigantic tomb.","From that time forward, up to the middle of December, the stress of their anxiety and mental suffering exceeded even what had gone before. The cold was grown to be so intense that the stove no longer sufficed to heat the great, barn-like room. When they looked from their window on the crust of snow that covered the frozen earth they thought of Maurice, entombed down yonder in distant Paris, that was now become a city of death and desolation, from which they scarcely ever received reliable intelligence. Ever the same questions were on their lips: what was he doing, why did he not let them hear from him? They dared not voice their dreadful doubts and fears; perhaps he was ill, or wounded; perhaps even he was dead. The scanty and vague tidings that continued to reach them occasionally through the newspapers were not calculated to reassure them. After numerous lying reports of successful sorties, circulated one day only to be contradicted the next, there was a rumor of a great victory gained by General Ducrot at Champigny on the 2d of December; but they speedily learned that on the following day the general, abandoning the positions he had won, had been forced to recross the Marne and send his troops into cantonments in the wood of Vincennes. With each new day the Parisians saw themselves subjected to fresh suffering and privation: famine was beginning to make itself felt; the authorities, having first requisitioned horned cattle, were now doing the same with potatoes, gas was no longer furnished to private houses, and soon the fiery flight of the projectiles could be traced as they tore through the darkness of the unlighted streets. And so it was that neither of them could draw a breath or eat a mouthful without being haunted by the image of Maurice and those two million living beings, imprisoned in their gigantic sepulcher."
"Enfin, Sambuc obtint du père Fouchard un sac, bien que le cœur de ce dernier saignât de donner encore quelque chose. Il le choisit parmi les plus mauvais, en disant qu’un sac troué, c’était trop bon pour un Prussien. Mais Cabasse et Ducat eurent toutes les peines du monde à faire entrer Goliath dans ce sac : le corps était trop gros, trop long, et les pieds dépassèrent. Puis, on le sortit, on le chargea sur la brouette qui servait à charrier le pain.","Finally, Sambuc obtained a bag from Father Fouchard, although the latter's heart was bleeding from giving anything more. He chose it among the worst, saying that a bag with holes was too good for a Prussian. But Cabasse and Ducat had all the difficulty in the world to get Goliath into this bag: the body was too big, too long, and the feet stuck out. Then we took him out and loaded him onto the wheelbarrow that was used to cart the bread.","In the end Sambuc got a sack from old Fouchard, much as the latter’s heart bled at having to give something else away. He chose it from among the worst he could find, saying that a sack with holes in was still too good for a Prussian. But Cabasse and Ducat had a terrible job to get Goliath into the sack – his body was too big, too long, and the feet stuck out. Then they took him outside and loaded him on to the barrow they used to carry the bread.","In the end Sambuc prevailed on Father Fouchard to let him have a sack, although it wrung the old miser's heartstrings to part with it. He selected one that was full of holes, remarking that anything was good enough for a Prussian. Cabasse and Ducat had all the trouble in the world to get Goliah into it; it was too short and too narrow for the long, broad body, and the feet protruded at its mouth. Then they carried their burden outside and placed it on the wheelbarrow that had served to convey to them their bread."
"Weiss revit alors, dans la teinturerie voisine, le petit Auguste malade, la face pourpre de fièvre entre ses draps blancs, demandant à boire, appelant sa mère, qui ne pouvait plus lui répondre, gisante sur le carreau, la tête broyée. Et, à cette vision, il eut un geste douloureux, il répondit :","Then Weiss saw again, in the nearby dry cleaners, the sick little Auguste, his face purple with fever between his white sheets, asking for a drink, calling his mother, who could no longer answer him, lying on the floor, her head crushed. And, at this vision, he made a painful gesture, he replied:","There came back into Weiss’s mind the sight of the sick child Auguste, with his face flushed with fever against the white sheets, calling his mother who could never answer again, lying on the pavement with her head smashed. With a gesture of grief at this vision he replied:","Weiss looked from the window, and, in the adjoining dyehouse, beheld the little sick boy, Charles, his scarlet face resting on the white pillow, imploringly begging his mother to bring him a drink: his mother, who lay dead across the threshold, beyond hearing or answering. With a sorrowful expression he replied:"
"– Oh ! ma chérie, ne me juge pas trop mal, ça me ferait tant de peine !… Je sais bien, je t’avais juré que ça ne recommencerait jamais. Mais tu as vu Edmond, il est si brave, et il est si joli ! Puis, songe donc, ce pauvre jeune homme, blessé, malade, loin de sa mère ! Avec ça, il n’a jamais été riche, on a tout mangé chez lui, pour le faire instruire… Je t’assure, je n’ai pas pu refuser.","- Oh ! my darling, don't judge me too badly, it would hurt me so much!... I know very well, I swore to you that it would never happen again. But you've seen Edmond, he's so brave, and he's so pretty! Then, think, this poor young man, wounded, sick, far from his mother! With that, he was never rich, we ate everything at his house, to make him educate... I assure you, I couldn't refuse.","‘Oh my dear, don’t think too ill of me, it would hurt me so much!… I know I had sworn it would never start again… But you have seen Edmond, he is so brave, and so handsome! And then just think, this poor young man, wounded, ill, far from his mother! And then he’s never had any money because everything at home went into his education… I tell you, I simply couldn’t refuse.’","“Oh, my darling, don't judge me severely; I could not bear it! I know I promised you it should never happen again, but you have seen Edmond, you know how brave he is, how handsome! And think once of the poor young man, wounded, ill, with no one to give him a mother's care! And then he has never had the enjoyments that wealth affords; his family have pinched themselves to give him an education. I could not be harsh with him.”"
"Une briqueterie était là, offrant un refuge. De l’autre côté, une pluie de balles en criblait les murs, et des obus, à chaque seconde, s’abattaient sur la route. Toute l’escorte s’était arrêtée.","A brickyard was there, offering refuge. On the other side, a hail of bullets riddled the walls, and shells, every second, fell on the road. The whole escort had stopped.","There was a brickworks there, affording some protection. On the other side the walls were being pitted with bullets, and every second a shell came down on the road. The whole escort had stopped.","There was a brick-kiln near by, behind which there was safety from the rain of bullets that kept pattering incessantly on its other front and the shells that burst at every second on the road. The mounted group had halted."
"– C’est stupide ! cria Delaherche, on ne brûle pas une ville qui n’a rien fait pour ça !","- That's stupid! cried Delaherche, you can't burn down a town that didn't do anything about it!",‘It’s ridiculous!’ exclaimed Delaherche. ‘You don’t burn down a town that’s done nothing to deserve it!’,“That's stupid!” exclaimed Delaherche; “they have no right to burn a city that has done nothing to deserve it!”
"Puis, devant le poing levé de Lapoulle, il prit sa course, galopant, dévalant des carrières dans les terres nues, du côté de Donchery. Les trois autres le poursuivaient, haletants, à toutes jambes. Mais il gagnait du terrain, plus léger, pris d’une telle peur, si entêté à garder son bien, qu’il semblait emporté par le vent. Il avait franchi près d’un kilomètre, il approchait du petit bois, au bord de l’eau, lorsqu’il rencontra Jean et Maurice, qui revenaient à leur gîte de la nuit. Au passage, il leur jeta un cri de détresse, tandis que ceux-ci, étonnés de cette chasse à l’homme, dont l’enragé galop passait devant eux, restaient plantés au bord d’un champ. Et ce fut ainsi qu’ils virent tout.","Then, in front of Lapoulle's raised fist, he took off, galloping, hurtling down quarries in the bare land, near Donchery. The other three were chasing him, panting, at full speed. But he was gaining ground, lighter, seized with such fear, so stubborn to keep his property, that he seemed to be carried away by the wind. He had covered nearly a kilometer, he was approaching the little wood, at the edge of the water, when he met Jean and Maurice, who were returning to their lodgings for the night. As they passed, he uttered a cry of distress to them, while the latter, astonished at this manhunt, whose furious gallop passed in front of them, remained planted at the edge of a field. And that was how they saw everything.","As Lapoulle raised his fist he took to his heels and ran down from the quarry to the open land towards Donchery. The three others gave chase at full speed, breathing hard. But he was leaving them behind, for he was lighter in build and so frightened and so determined to keep what was his own that he seemed to be borne by the wind. He had covered nearly a kilometre and was nearing the little copse by the river when he ran into Jean and Maurice, who were coming back to their place for the night. As he went by he shouted for help, but they were so astonished by this man-hunt galloping past them that they remained rooted at the edge of a field. And so they saw it all.","Then, at sight of Lapoulle's raised fist, he broke away and ran, sliding down the steep banks of the quarries, making his way across the bare fields in the direction of Donchery, the three others after him in hot pursuit. He gained on them, however, being lighter than they, and possessed by such overmastering fear, so determined to hold on to what was his property, that his speed seemed to rival the wind. He had already covered more than half a mile and was approaching the little wood on the margin of the stream when he encountered Jean and Maurice, who were on their way back to their resting-place for the night. He addressed them an appealing, distressful cry as he passed; while they, astounded by the wild hunt that went fleeting by, stood motionless at the edge of a field, and thus it was that they beheld the ensuing tragedy."
"– La patte est rouge, cria-t-elle, ah ! je l’aurais parié.","“The paw is red,” she cried, “ah! I would have bet it.","‘Red shoulder-straps,’ she called out, ‘oh, I could have taken a bet on it!’",she exclaimed. “I knew it.”
"– Un autre jour, la soupe ! On part tout de suite !","– Another day, soup! We leave right now !",‘Stew another day! We’re off at once!’,“You will have to wait for your soup until some other day; we are to march at once.”
"Maurice fut heureux de constater que la colonne tournait à gauche et qu’elle traverserait Sedan. Peut-être aurait-il la chance d’apercevoir une fois encore sa sœur Henriette. Mais les cinq kilomètres qui séparaient la presqu’île d’Iges de la ville, suffirent pour gâter sa joie de se sentir hors du cloaque, où il avait agonisé pendant neuf jours. C’était un autre supplice, ce convoi pitoyable de prisonniers, des soldats sans armes, les mains ballantes, menés comme des moutons, dans un piétinement hâtif et peureux. Vêtus de loques, souillés d’avoir été abandonnés dans leur ordure, amaigris par un jeûne d’une grande semaine, ils ne ressemblaient plus qu’à des vagabonds, des rôdeurs louches, que des gendarmes auraient ramassés par les routes, d’un coup de filet. Dès le faubourg de Torcy, comme des hommes s’arrêtaient et que des femmes se mettaient sur les portes, d’un air de sombre commisération, un flot de honte étouffa Maurice, il baissa la tête, la bouche amère.","Maurice was happy to see that the column was turning left and going through Sedan. Perhaps he would be lucky enough to see his sister Henriette once again. But the five kilometers that separated the peninsula of Iges from the city were enough to spoil his joy at feeling out of the cesspool, where he had been dying for nine days. It was another ordeal, that pitiful convoy of prisoners, unarmed soldiers with dangling hands, led like sheep in hasty, fearful stamping. Dressed in rags, soiled from having been abandoned in their filth, emaciated by a long week's fast, they no longer resembled anything but vagabonds, suspicious prowlers whom the gendarmes would have picked up along the roads, net stroke. From the Faubourg de Torcy, as men stopped and women stood at the doors, with an air of gloomy commiseration, a wave of shame suffocated Maurice, he lowered his head, his mouth bitter.","Maurice was glad to see that the column was turning left and going through Sedan. Perhaps he would be lucky enough to catch one more glimpse of his sister Henriette. But the five kilometres between the Iges peninsula and the town were enough to take the edge off his joy at feeling himself out of the sink of filth in which he had suffered nine days of torment. But this pathetic convoy of prisoners was a new kind of torture, with these weaponless men dangling their useless hands, being driven like sheep with hurried and frightened steps. Dressed in rags, filthy from having been left in their own excrement, emaciated after fasting for over a week, they looked like nothing but a lot of vagrants and suspicious characters that the police had roped in from the streets. From Torcy onwards, as men stood still and women came to the doors to stare at them with sullen sympathy, Maurice was overcome with shame and looked down at the ground, a bitter taste in his mouth.","Maurice was glad to observe that the column took the left-hand road and would pass through Sedan; perhaps he would have an opportunity of seeing his sister Henriette. All the pleasure, however, that he had experienced at his release from that foul cesspool where he had spent nine days of agony was dashed to the ground and destroyed during the three-mile march from the peninsula of Iges to the city. It was but another form of his old distress to behold that array of prisoners, shuffling timorously through the dust of the road, like a flock of sheep with the dog at their heels. There is no spectacle in all the world more pitiful than that of a column of vanquished troops being marched off into captivity under guard of their conquerors, without arms, their empty hands hanging idly at their sides; and these men, clad in rags and tatters, besmeared with the filth in which they had lain for more than a week, gaunt and wasted after their long fast, were more like vagabonds than soldiers; they resembled loathsome, horribly dirty tramps, whom the gendarmes would have picked up along the highways and consigned to the lockup. As they passed through the Faubourg of Torcy, where men paused on the sidewalks and women came to their doors to regard them with mournful, compassionate interest, the blush of shame rose to Maurice's cheek, he hung his head and a bitter taste came to his mouth."
"– Vous arrivez à propos pour le gronder, dit-il, affectant de rire. Il n’est guère sage.","""You have come just in time to scold him,"" he said, affecting a laugh. He is hardly wise.","‘You’ve come at the right time to give him a talking to,’ he said, pretending to be joking. ‘ He’s not being a good boy.’","“You come just in time to give him a scolding,” he said, with an affectation of liveliness. “He is not a good boy this morning.”"
"– Dites donc, madame, comme ça, où donc allez-vous ?","“I say, madam, like that, where are you going?","‘I say, Missis, where are you off to like this?’","“I say, lady, tell us where you're going, will you?”"
"Henriette, elle, n’en était pas même effleurée. Au lendemain du drame atroce de Bazeilles, son cœur restait meurtri ; et, s’il y entrait un soulagement, une tendresse nouvelle, ce ne pouvait être qu’à son insu : tout un de ces sourds cheminements de la graine qui germe, sans que rien, au regard, révèle le travail caché. Elle ignorait jusqu’au plaisir qu’elle avait fini par prendre à rester des heures près du lit de Jean, à lui lire ces journaux, qui ne leur apportaient pourtant que du chagrin. Jamais sa main, en rencontrant la sienne, n’avait eu même une tiédeur ; jamais l’idée du lendemain ne l’avait laissée rêveuse, avec le souhait d’être aimée encore. Pourtant, elle n’oubliait, elle n’était consolée que dans cette chambre. Quand elle se trouvait là, s’occupant avec sa douceur active, son cœur se calmait, il lui semblait que son frère reviendrait prochainement, que tout s’arrangerait très bien, qu’on finirait par être tous heureux, en ne se quittant plus. Et elle en parlait sans trouble, tellement il lui paraissait naturel que les choses fussent ainsi, sans qu’il lui vînt à la pensée de s’interroger davantage, dans le don chaste et ignoré de tout son cœur.","Henriette was not even touched by it. In the aftermath of the atrocious drama at Bazeilles, his heart remained bruised; and, if there was a relief, a new tenderness, it could only be unbeknownst to her: all one of those deaf journeys of the seed which germinates, without anything, to the gaze, revealing the hidden work. She was unaware of the pleasure she had ended up taking in remaining for hours by Jean's bed, in reading to him those newspapers, which, however, only brought them grief. Never had her hand, on meeting his, felt even warmth; never had the idea of tomorrow left her daydreaming, with the wish to be loved again. Yet she never forgot, she was consoled only in this room. When she was there, occupying herself with her active sweetness, her heart calmed down, it seemed to her that her brother would return soon, that everything would work out very well, that we would all end up being happy, never leaving each other again. . And she spoke of it without hesitation, it seemed so natural to her that things should be like this, without it occurring to her to question herself further, in the chaste and ignored gift of all her heart.","But no such thoughts even touched Henriette’s mind. After the dreadful drama at Bazeilles her heart remained dead, and any comfort or new affection could only enter it unrecognized, like the unperceived movement of germinating seed that nothing betrays to the human eye. She was not even conscious of the pleasure she had come to take in lingering for hours at Jean’s bedside, reading the papers to him even though they gave her nothing but sorrow. Her hand when it touched his had not even felt any warmth, never had the idea of the morrow left her thoughtful, with a wish to be loved once again. And yet only in this room could she forget or find consolation. When she was there, quietly busying herself with her tasks, she found rest to her soul and felt that her brother would soon come back, that all would work out for the best and they would eventually all be happy together and never be parted again. She talked about it quite freely, for it seemed so natural that things should be so and it never entered her mind to look more deeply into the chaste and hidden gift of her heart.","For her part, such thoughts had never for a moment presented themselves to Henriette's mind. Since the day of the horrible tragedy at Bazeilles her bruised heart had lain numb and lifeless in her bosom, and if consolation in the shape of a new affection had found its way thither, it could not be otherwise than without her knowledge; the latent movement of the seed deep-buried in the earth, which bursts its sheath and germinates, unseen of human eye. She failed even to perceive the pleasure it afforded her to remain for hours at a time by Jean's bedside, reading to him those newspapers that never brought them tidings save of evil. Never had her pulses beat more rapidly at the touch of his hand, never had she dwelt in dreamy rapture on the vision of the future with a longing to be loved once more. And yet it was in that chamber alone that she found comfort and oblivion. When she was there, busying herself with noiseless diligence for her patient's well-being, she was at peace; it seemed to her that soon her brother would return and all would be well, they would all lead a life of happiness together and never more be parted. And it appeared to her so natural that things should end thus that she talked of their relations without the slightest feeling of embarrassment, without once thinking to question her heart more closely, unaware that she had already made the chaste surrender of it."
"– Comprenez donc, disait Weiss, en répétant son geste, ses deux bras élargis et ses deux mains rejointes, ça va être comme ça, si vos généraux n’y prennent pas garde… On vous amuse à Bazeilles…","""Understand then,"" said Weiss, repeating his gesture, his two outstretched arms and his two joined hands, ""it's going to be like that, if your generals don't take care... We amuse you at Bazeilles...""","‘Now look,’ he said, repeating his gesture with arms out wide and hands coming together, ‘that’s what it’s going to be like if your generals don’t watch it… They’re just keeping you amused at Bazeilles.’","“Understand,” said Weiss, with a repetition of his previous gesture, extending his arms and bringing his hands slowly together, “that is how it will be unless your generals keep their eyes open. The movement at Bazeilles is only a feint—”"
"Et il resta seul, à se tordre sur la mousse, dans ce coin délicieux du bois, arrachant les herbes de ses mains crispées, la poitrine soulevée par un râle qui dura pendant des heures.","And he was left alone, writhing on the moss, in this delicious corner of the wood, pulling the grass with his clenched hands, his chest heaving in a rattle that lasted for hours.","There he stayed alone, writhing on the moss in this lovely woodland dell, clawing at grass with his clenched hands, his chest heaving in a death-struggle that went on for hours.","And they left him to himself in that charming woodland glade to writhe in protracted agony upon the ground, tearing up the grass with his stiffening fingers and praying for death, which would be hours yet ere it came to end his misery."
"– Tiens ! ricana Loubet, le capitaine a donc retrouvé ses bagages !","- Take ! sneered Loubet, so the captain has found his luggage!",‘Just look at that!’ sneered Loubet. ‘So the captain’s found his luggage again!’,"“Hallo!” said Loubet, with a sneer, “the captain has recovered his baggage!”"
"Puis, Delaherche poussa jusqu’à la Sous-Préfecture, pour savoir si l’empereur n’avait pas reparu. On ne put lui donner que des nouvelles du maréchal de Mac-Mahon, dont un chirurgien avait pansé la blessure peu dangereuse, et qui était tranquillement dans son lit. Mais, vers onze heures, comme il battait de nouveau le pavé, il fut arrêté un instant, dans la Grande-Rue, devant l’hôtel de l’Europe, par un lent cortège, des cavaliers couverts de poussière, dont les mornes chevaux marchaient au pas. Et, à la tête, il reconnut l’empereur, qui rentrait après avoir passé quatre heures sur le champ de bataille. La mort n’avait pas voulu de lui, décidément. Sous la sueur d’angoisse de cette marche au travers de la défaite, le fard s’en était allé des joues, les moustaches cirées s’étaient amollies, pendantes, la face terreuse avait pris l’hébètement douloureux d’une agonie. Un officier, qui descendit devant l’hôtel, se mit à expliquer au milieu d’un groupe la route parcourue, de la Moncelle à Givonne, tout le long de la petite vallée, parmi les soldats du 1er corps, que les Saxons avaient refoulés sur la rive droite du ruisseau ; et l’on était revenu par le chemin creux du Fond de Givonne, dans un tel encombrement déjà, que même, si l’empereur avait désiré retourner sur le front des troupes, il n’aurait pu le faire que très difficilement. D’ailleurs, à quoi bon ?","Then Delaherche went to the Sub-Prefecture to find out if the Emperor had not reappeared. They could only give him news of Marshal de Mac-Mahon, whose not very dangerous wound had been dressed by a surgeon, and who was quietly in bed. But, about eleven o'clock, as he was pounding the pavement again, he was stopped for a moment, in the Grande-Rue, in front of the Hotel de l'Europe, by a slow procession, horsemen covered with dust, whose gloomy horses walked in step. And at the head he recognized the Emperor, who was returning after having spent four hours on the field of battle. Death had definitely not wanted him. Under the sweat of anguish from this march through defeat, the blush had gone from the cheeks, the waxed mustaches had softened, hanging down, the earthy face had taken on the painful stupefaction of agony. An officer, who went down in front of the hotel, began to explain in the middle of a group the route traveled, from La Moncelle to Givonne, all along the little valley, among the soldiers of the 1st corps, whom the Saxons had driven back. on the right bank of the stream; and they had come back by the sunken lane of the Fond de Givonne, already in such a jam that even if the Emperor had wanted to return to the front of the troops, he would have been able to do so with great difficulty. Besides, what good is it?","Next Delaherche moved on to the Sub-Prefecture to find out whether the Emperor had reappeared or not. The only news anyone could give him was about Marshal MacMahon whose wound, not at all dangerous, had been dressed by a surgeon and who was now peacefully in bed. But towards eleven, while he was still tramping the streets, he was held up for a moment in the Grande-Rue in front of the Hôtel de l’Europe by a slow procession of horsemen covered with dust whose weary mounts were going at a walking pace. At their head he recognized the Emperor, returning after spending four hours on the field of battle. Death hadn’t any use for him, obviously. In the anguished sweat of this ride through defeat the make-up had gone from his cheeks and his waxed moustache had got soft and drooping, the ashen face had taken on the agonized stupor of a dying man. An officer who dismounted in front of the hotel began explaining to a group of people the route they had followed, from La Moncelle to Givonne all along the little valley, among the soldiers of the 1st corps whom the Saxons had thrown back on to the right bank of the stream; and they had come along the road in the cutting of Fond de Givonne, in such a jam already that even if the Emperor had wanted to go back to his front line troops he could only have done so with the greatest difficulty. Besides, what was the good?","From there Delaherche pushed forward to the Sous-Prefecture to ascertain whether the Emperor had returned yet from the field of battle. The only tidings he gleaned here were of Marshal MacMahon, who was said to be resting comfortably, his wound, which was not dangerous, having been dressed by a surgeon. About eleven o'clock, however, as he was again going the rounds, his progress was arrested for a moment in the Grande-Rue, opposite the Hotel de l'Europe, by a sorry cavalcade of dust-stained horsemen, whose jaded nags were moving at a walk, and at their head he recognized the Emperor, who was returning after having spent four hours on the battle-field. It was plain that death would have nothing to do with him. The big drops of anguish had washed the rouge from off those painted cheeks, the waxed mustache had lost its stiffness and drooped over the mouth, and in that ashen face, in those dim eyes, was the stupor of one in his last agony. One of the officers alighted in front of the hotel and proceeded to give some friends, who were collected there, an account of their route, from la Moncelle to Givonne, up the entire length of the little valley among the soldiers of the 1st corps, who had already been pressed back by the Saxons across the little stream to the right bank; and they had returned by the sunken road of the Fond de Givonne, which was even then in such an encumbered condition that had the Emperor desired to make his way to the front again he would have found the greatest difficulty in doing so. Besides, what would it have availed?"
"Mais, déjà, Silvine, frémissante, l’avait saisi dans ses bras, le serrait contre sa poitrine.","But, already, Silvine, quivering, had seized him in her arms, pressing him to her bosom.",Silvine snatched the boy up indignantly in her arms and clasped him to her breast.,"But before he could lay hands on the child Silvine, all a-quiver with excitement, had thrown her arms about it and clasped it to her bosom."
– Silence donc ! je mets au rapport le premier qui bouge !,- So be quiet! I report the first that moves!,‘Now you shut up! I’ll report the first one to move.’,“Silence there! I will report the first man who says another word!”
"Alors, ce fut une marche folle. Entre deux nuages, le soleil apparut un instant, déjà bas sur l’horizon. Est-ce que la nuit allait tomber et les surprendre, dans ce charnier sans fin ? Une nouvelle averse noya le soleil, il ne resta autour d’eux que l’infini blafard de la pluie, une poussière d’eau qui effaçait tout, les routes, les champs, les arbres. Lui, ne savait plus, était perdu, et il l’avoua. À leur suite, l’âne trottait du même train, la tête basse, traînant la petite charrette de son pas résigné de bête docile. Ils montèrent au nord, ils revinrent vers Sedan. Toute direction leur échappait, ils rebroussèrent chemin à deux reprises, en s’apercevant qu’ils passaient par les mêmes endroits. Sans doute ils tournaient en cercle, et ils finirent, désespérés, épuisés, par s’arrêter à l’angle de trois routes, flagellés de pluie, sans force pour chercher davantage.","So, it was a crazy walk. Between two clouds, the sun appeared for a moment, already low on the horizon. Was night going to fall and surprise them, in this endless mass grave? A new downpour drowned out the sun, all that remained around them was the pale infinity of the rain, a dust of water that erased everything, the roads, the fields, the trees. He, no longer knew, was lost, and he admitted it. Following them, the donkey trotted along, head down, dragging the little cart with the resigned step of a docile animal. They went up to the north, they came back towards Sedan. All direction escaped them, they turned back twice, realizing that they were passing through the same places. No doubt they were turning in a circle, and they ended, desperate, exhausted, by stopping at the corner of three roads, scourged with rain, without the strength to search any further.","Then began a frantic hunt. The sun appeared for a moment between two clouds, but it was already low down on the horizon. Were they going to be benighted in this endless graveyard? A new downpour obscured the sun again, and there was nothing round them but the dismal waste of rain, like a dust-storm of water effacing everything, roads, fields. trees. He no longer knew where he was, had lost his bearings and said so. The donkey trotted along behind them at the same even pace, head down and pulling his little cart with his resigned, docile gait. They went north, then came back towards Sedan. They lost all sense of direction, twice went back on their tracks when they realized they were passing the same things again. Probably they were going round in a circle, and ultimately they pulled up, tired and desperate, at a point where three roads met, lashed by the rain and too exhausted to go on looking.","Then ensued a wild, aimless scamper across the bosom of the great, sinister plain. The sun, now sinking rapidly toward the horizon, showed its face for a moment from between two clouds. Was night to descend and surprise them in the midst of that vast charnel-house? Another shower came down; the sun was obscured, the rain and mist formed an impenetrable barrier about them, so that the country around, roads, fields, trees, was shut out from their vision. Prosper knew not where they were; he was lost, and admitted it: his memory was all astray, he could recall nothing precise of the occurrences of that terrible day but one before. Behind them, his head lowered almost to the ground, the little donkey trotted along resignedly, dragging the cart, with his customary docility. First they took a northerly course, then they returned toward Sedan. They had lost their bearings and could not tell in which direction they were going; twice they noticed that they were passing localities that they had passed before and retraced their steps. They had doubtless been traveling in a circle, and there came a moment when in their exhaustion and despair they stopped at a place where three roads met, without courage to pursue their search further, the rain pelting down on them, lost and utterly miserable in the midst of a sea of mud."
"La dépêche du maréchal, datée du 19, après Saint-Privat, dans laquelle il parlait de reprendre son mouvement de retraite, par Montmédy, cette dépêche qui avait décidé la marche en avant de l’armée de Châlons, ne paraissait être que le rapport d’un général battu, désireux d’atténuer sa défaite ; et plus tard, le 29 seulement, lorsque la nouvelle de cette approche d’une armée de secours lui était parvenue, au travers des lignes prussiennes, il avait bien tenté un dernier effort, sur la rive droite, à Noiseville, mais si mollement, que, le 1er septembre, le jour même où l’armée de Châlons était écrasée à Sedan, celle de Metz se repliait, définitivement paralysée, morte pour la France. Le maréchal, qui, jusque-là, avait pu n’être qu’un capitaine médiocre, négligeant de passer lorsque les routes restaient ouvertes, véritablement barré ensuite par des forces supérieures, allait devenir maintenant, sous l’empire de préoccupations politiques, un conspirateur et un traître.","The marshal's despatch, dated the 19th, after Saint-Privat, in which he spoke of resuming his retreat, via Montmédy, this despatch which had decided the advance march of the army of Châlons, appeared to be only the report of a defeated general, eager to mitigate his defeat; and later, on the 29th only, when the news of this approach of a relief army had reached him, through the Prussian lines, he had indeed attempted a last effort, on the right bank, at Noiseville, but so weakly, that on September 1, the very day on which the army of Chalons was crushed at Sedan, that of Metz fell back, definitively paralyzed, dead for France. The Marshal, who hitherto had been a mediocre captain, neglecting to pass when the roads remained open, then truly barred by superior forces, was now to become, under the influence of political preoccupations, a conspirator and traitor.","The dispatch from the marshal dated the 19th, after Saint-Privat, in which he talked of resuming his retreat via Montmédy, and which had determined the advance of the army of Châlons, now appeared to be nothing but the report of a beaten general anxious to tone down his defeat, and only later, on the 29th, when the news of the approach of a rescuing army reached him through the Prussian lines, had he tried one last effort at Noiseville on the right bank, but so half-heartedly that on 1 September, the very day on which the army of Châlons was crushed at Sedan, that of Metz fell back, definitely paralysed and dead as far as France was concerned. By neglecting to move while routes were still open and then being genuinely halted by superior forces, the marshal, who until then might have been an indifferent commander, but nothing worse, from now on, under the influence of his political calculations, was going to become a conspirator and a traitor.","The marshal's despatch, dated the 19th, after the battle of Saint-Privat, in which he spoke of resuming his retrograde movement by way of Montmedy, that despatch which had for its effect the advance of the army of Chalons, would seem to have been nothing more than the report of a defeated general, desirous to present matters under their most favorable aspect, and it was not until a considerably later period, the 29th, when the tidings of the approach of this relieving army had reached him through the Prussian lines, that he attempted a final effort, on the right bank this time, at Noiseville, but in such a feeble, half-hearted way that on the 1st of September, the day when the army of Chalons was annihilated at Sedan, the army of Metz fell back to advance no more, and became as if dead to France. The marshal, whose conduct up to that time may fairly be characterized as that of a leader of only moderate ability, neglecting his opportunities and failing to move when the roads were open to him, after that blockaded by forces greatly superior to his own, was now about to be seduced by alluring visions of political greatness and become a conspirator and a traitor."
"– Je ne sais pas, je n’ai pas compris… Me voilà dans l’inquiétude, tant que je n’aurai pas de nouvelles.","– I don’t know, I didn’t understand… Here I am in worry, as long as I don’t have any news.","‘I don’t know, I didn’t understand… Now I shall be worried so long as I don’t get any news.’",“I don't know; I could not understand him; I shall have no peace of mind until I hear from her.”
"Et Maurice fut laissé à la garde de la marmite d’eau qui bouillait, avec l’ordre d’entretenir le feu. Il s’était assis sur sa couverture, le pied déchaussé, pour que la plaie séchât. La vue du camp l’intéressait, toutes les escouades en l’air, depuis qu’elles n’attendaient plus les distributions. Cette vérité se faisait en lui que certaines manquaient toujours de tout, tandis que d’autres vivaient dans une continuelle abondance, selon la prévoyance et l’adresse du caporal et des hommes. Au milieu de l’énorme agitation qui l’entourait, à travers les faisceaux et les tentes, il en remarquait qui n’avaient pas même pu allumer leur feu, d’autres résignées déjà, couchées pour la nuit, d’autres, au contraire, en train de manger de grand appétit, on ne savait quoi, de bonnes choses. Et ce qui le frappait d’autre part, c’était le bel ordre de l’artillerie de réserve, campée au-dessus de lui, sur le coteau. À son coucher, le soleil parut entre deux nuages, embrasa les canons, que les artilleurs avaient déjà lavés de la boue des chemins.","And Maurice was left in charge of the pot of boiling water, with orders to keep the fire going. He had sat down on his blanket, his foot barefoot, so that the wound would dry up. The sight of the camp interested him, all the squads in the air, since they were no longer waiting for the distributions. This truth dawned on him that some always lacked everything, while others lived in continual abundance, according to the foresight and skill of the corporal and the men. In the midst of the enormous commotion that surrounded him, through the beams and the tents, he noticed some who had not even been able to light their fire, others already resigned, in bed for the night, others, at the on the contrary, eating with great appetite, who knows what, good things. And what struck him on the other hand was the fine order of the reserve artillery, camped above him, on the hillside. At sunset, the sun appeared between two clouds, ignited the guns, which the artillerymen had already washed from the mud of the roads.","Maurice was left to give an eye to the pan of boiling water, with orders to keep up the fire. He sat on his blanket with his boot and sock off so that his bad place could dry. He was interested in watching the camp, with all the squads running about now that they were not expecting any issue of food. The truth was dawning on him that some were continually going without everything while others lived in perpetual abundance, according to the foresight and adroitness of the corporal and his men. In the enormous amount of activity going on round him, in and out between stacked arms and tents, he saw some who had not even been able to light themselves a fire, others, already resigned, who had bedded down for the night, but in contrast others busy eating with great relish something or other, but certainly something good. What also struck him was the good order of the reserve artillery camped higher up on the bluff. The setting sun appeared between two clouds and lit up the guns from which the artillerymen had already cleaned off all the mud from the roads.","So Maurice was left to keep up the fire and watch the kettle, in which the water was beginning to boil. He had seated himself on his blanket and taken off his shoe in order to give his blister a chance to heal. It amused him to look about the camp and watch the behavior of the different squads now that there was to be no issue of rations; the deduction that he arrived at was that some of them were in a chronic state of destitution, while others reveled in continual abundance, and that these conditions were ascribable to the greater or less degree of tact and foresight of the corporal and his men. Amid the confusion that reigned about the stacks and tents he remarked some squads who had not been able even to start a fire, others of which the men had abandoned hope and lain themselves resignedly down for the night, while others again were ravenously devouring , no one knew what, something good, no doubt. Another thing that impressed him was the good order that prevailed in the artillery, which had its camp above him, on the hillside. The setting sun peeped out from a rift in the clouds and his rays were reflected from the burnished guns, from which the men had cleansed the coat of mud that they had picked up along the road."
"L’officier se débattait au milieu de la route encombrée, pour que le peloton eût un peu de recul. Quand il aperçut cette femme au cou d’un des prisonniers, il reprit violemment, en français :","The officer was struggling in the middle of the crowded road, so that the peloton could have some distance. When he saw this woman around the neck of one of the prisoners, he resumed violently, in French:","The officer was busying himself in the middle of the cluttered road to give his squad a little more distance, when he saw this woman hanging on to the neck of one of the prisoners and he said angrily, in French again:","The officer, who was endeavoring to clear the road in order to give the firing party the requisite room, came up on hearing the sound of voices, and beholding a woman with her arms about the neck of one of his prisoners, exclaimed loudly in French:"
"Et Maurice n’était pas allongé de nouveau, qu’un obus passa en sifflant. À partir de ce moment, ils ne cessèrent plus. Le tir ne se régla qu’avec lenteur, les premiers allèrent tomber bien au delà de la batterie, qui, elle aussi, commençait à tirer. En outre, beaucoup de projectiles n’éclataient pas, amortis dans la terre molle ; et ce furent d’abord des plaisanteries sans fin sur la maladresse de ces sacrés mangeurs de choucroute.","And Maurice was no sooner lying down than a shell whistled past. From that moment on, they never stopped. The firing was regulated only slowly, the first went to fall well beyond the battery, which, too, began to fire. Besides, many projectiles did not burst, deadened in the soft earth; and at first there were endless jokes about the clumsiness of these damned sauerkraut eaters.","Maurice had hardly got down again before a shell whistled overhead. From then on they never stopped. The range was only gradually adjusted, the first came well beyond the battery, which began to fire also. As a matter of fact many shells did not explode because they were deadened in soft earth, and at first there were plenty of jokes about the clumsiness of these bloody sauerkraut-eaters.","And Maurice had barely more than complied with this intimation when a shell passed screaming over him. From that time forth there seemed to be no end to them. The enemy's gunners were slow in obtaining the range, their first projectiles passing over and landing well to the rear of the battery, which was now opening in reply. Many of their shells, too, fell upon the soft ground, in which they buried themselves without exploding, and for a time there was a great display of rather heavy wit at the expense of those bloody sauerkraut eaters."
"Il se grandit encore, levant son bras comme la hampe d’un drapeau !","He grows still taller, raising his arm like the staff of a flag!","He drew himself higher still, raising his arm like a flagstaff.","He drew his tall form up higher still and raised his arm aloft, like the staff of a battle-flag."
"– Ils ne vont pas fermer la porte au moins, avant que tout le monde soit rentré.","- They won't close the door at least, before everyone is inside.",‘Surely they aren’t going to shut the gate before everyone’s got in.’,"“It cannot be,” he said, “that they will have the cruelty to close the gate and shut us out.”"
"Silvine, lasse de ces champs de mort, où elle croyait marcher depuis des lieues, regardait autour d’elle, avec une angoisse croissante.","Silvine, tired of these fields of death, where she thought she had been walking for miles, looked around her with increasing anguish.","Weary of these fields of death through which she felt she had been walking for leagues, Silvine looked round her with growing anguish.","Silvine, who was beginning to weary of those fields of death over which she had tramped so many long miles, looked about her with increasing distrust and uneasiness."
"Comme s’il n’entendait pas, le jeune homme regardait fixement devant lui, les yeux perdus. Dans l’ivresse de sa fatigue, une fièvre remontait, une surexcitation nerveuse extraordinaire, toutes les souffrances, toutes les révoltes amassées depuis le commencement de la campagne. La vue de son ami agonisant, le sentiment de sa propre défaite, nu, sans armes, bon à rien, la pensée que tant d’héroïques efforts avaient abouti à une pareille détresse, le jetaient dans un besoin frénétique de rébellion contre le destin. Enfin, il parla.","As if he did not hear, the young man stared fixedly in front of him, his eyes lost. In the intoxication of his fatigue, a fever rose again, an extraordinary nervous excitement, all the sufferings, all the revolts amassed since the beginning of the campaign. The sight of his dying friend, the sense of his own defeat, naked, unarmed, good for nothing, the thought that so many heroic efforts had resulted in such distress, threw him into a frenzied need to rebel against fate. Finally, he spoke.","The young man stared straight in front of him with unseeing eyes, as though he had not heard. In his utterly exhausted state his own feverishness was coming back in the form of abnormal nervous excitement due to all the accumulated sufferings and revulsions since the beginning of the campaign. The sight of his stricken friend, the sense of his own defeat, naked, disarmed, good for nothing, the thought that so many heroic efforts had ended in such distress, all threw him into a frantic need to rebel against fate. Then at length he answered:","The young man continued to gaze before him into vacancy, as if he had not heard. In the confused hallucination that was due to his fatigue he developed a kind of delirium, a supersensitive nervous excitation that embraced all he had suffered in mind and body since the beginning of the campaign. The spectacle of his friend's wretched state, his own condition, scarce less pitiful, defeated, his hands tied, good for nothing, the reflection that all those heroic efforts had culminated in such disaster, all combined to incite him to frantic rebellion against destiny. At last he spoke."
"Il n’était pas huit heures. Le canon, qui redoublait du côté de Bazeilles, se faisait aussi entendre à l’est, dans le vallon de la Givonne, qu’on ne pouvait voir : c’était le moment où l’armée du prince royal de Saxe, au sortir du bois Chevalier, abordait le 1er corps, en avant de Daigny. Et, maintenant que le XIe corps prussien, en marche vers Floing, ouvrait le feu sur les troupes du général Douay, la bataille se trouvait engagée de toutes parts, du sud au nord, sur cet immense périmètre de plusieurs lieues.","It was not eight o'clock. The cannon, which redoubled on the side of Bazeilles, was also heard to the east, in the valley of Givonne, which could not be seen: it was the moment when the army of the Prince Royal of Saxony, on leaving du Bois Chevalier, approached the 1st corps, in front of Daigny. And now that the Prussian XI Corps, on the march towards Floing, opened fire on General Douay's troops, the battle was engaged on all sides, from south to north, on this immense perimeter of several leagues.","It was not yet eight. The gunfire getting stronger in the Bazeilles direction could now be heard eastwards too, out of sight up the Givonne valley – it was just at the moment when the army of the Crown Prince of Saxony, emerging from the Chevalier wood, came up against the 1st corps before Daigny. And now that the Xlth Prussian corps, marching on Floing, was opening fire on General Douay’s troops, the battle was joined in all directions, from north to south round this immense perimeter of many leagues.","It was not eight o'clock. The guns, which were thundering more fiercely than ever in the direction of Bazeilles, now also began to make themselves heard at the eastward, in the valley of la Givonne, which was hid from view; it was the army of the Crown Prince of Saxony, debouching from the Chevalier wood and attacking the 1st corps, in front of Daigny village; and now that the XIth Prussian corps, moving on Floing, had opened fire on General Douay's troops, the investment was complete at every point of the great periphery of several leagues' extent, and the action was general all along the line."
"Des heures s’écoulèrent, elle s’inquiétait maintenant des lointaines lueurs aperçues dans la campagne, par-dessus les remparts. Il faisait si sombre, qu’elle tâchait de reconstituer les lieux. En bas, cette grande nappe pâle, c’étaient bien les prairies inondées. Alors, quel était donc ce feu, qu’elle avait vu briller et s’éteindre, là-haut, sans doute sur la Marfée ? Et, de toutes parts, il en flambait d’autres, à Pont-Maugis, à Noyers, à Frénois, des feux mystérieux qui vacillaient comme au-dessus d’une multitude innombrable, pullulant dans l’ombre. Puis, davantage encore, des rumeurs extraordinaires la faisaient tressaillir, le piétinement d’un peuple en marche, des souffles de bêtes, des chocs d’armes, toute une chevauchée au fond de ces ténèbres d’enfer. Brusquement, éclata un coup de canon, un seul, formidable, effrayant dans l’absolu silence qui suivit. Elle en eut le sang glacé. Qu’était-ce donc ? Un signal sans doute, la réussite de quelque mouvement, l’annonce qu’ils étaient prêts, là-bas, et que le soleil pouvait paraître.","Hours passed, she now worried about the distant lights seen in the countryside, above the ramparts. It was so dark that she was trying to reconstruct the scene. Below, this great pale tablecloth, it was indeed the flooded meadows. So what was that fire that she had seen shining and dying out up there, no doubt on the Marfée? And, on all sides, others were blazing, at Pont-Maugis, at Noyers, at Frénois, mysterious fires which flickered as if above an innumerable multitude, swarming in the shadows. Then, still more, extraordinary rumors made her shudder, the trampling of a people on the march, the breaths of beasts, the clash of arms, a whole ride in the depths of this darkness of hell. Suddenly, a cannon shot burst out, a single, formidable, frightening one in the absolute silence that followed. Her blood froze. What was it? A signal no doubt, the success of some movement, the announcement that they were ready, over there, and that the sun could appear.","Hours went by, and now she was worried by distant lights out in the country beyond the ramparts. It was so dark that she had to make an effort to place things. That great pale sheet down there must be the flooded meadows. So what was that light she had seen come on and then go out up there, perhaps on La Marfée? Others flared up in all directions, at Pont-Maugis, Noyers, Frénois, mysterious lights twinkling as if over a countless multitude teeming in the night. And then another thing, extraordinary noises startled her, like the tramp of a people on the move, snorting of animals, clashing of arms, a whole cavalcade in this infernal darkness. Suddenly a single cannon shot rang out, terrifying in the absolute silence that followed. It froze her blood. What could it be? No doubt some signal, some manoeuvre successfully carried out, an announcement that they were now ready over there and that the sun could come out.","Hours passed, and now distant lights that began to twinkle in the open fields beyond the ramparts excited afresh her apprehensions. It was so dark that it cost her an effort of memory to recall localities. She knew that the broad expanse that lay beneath her, reflecting a dim light, was the flooded meadows, and that flame that blazed up and was suddenly extinguished, surely it must be on la Marfee. But never, to her certain knowledge, had there been farmer's house or peasant's cottage on those heights; what, then, was the meaning of that light? And then on every hand, at Pont-Maugis, Noyers, Frenois, other fires arose, coruscating fitfully for an instant and giving mysterious indication of the presence of the swarming host that lay hidden in the bosom of the night. Yet more: there were strange sounds and voices in the air, subdued murmurings such as she had never heard before, and that made her start in terror; the stifled hum of marching men, the neighing and snorting of steeds, the clash of arms, hoarse words of command, given in guttural accents; an evil dream of a demoniac crew, a witch's sabbat, in the depths of those unholy shades. Suddenly a single cannon-shot rang out, ear-rending, adding fresh terror to the dead silence that succeeded it. It froze her very marrow; what could it mean? A signal, doubtless, telling of the successful completion of some movement, announcing that everything was ready, down there, and that now the sun might rise."
"Malgré l’attention qu’il donnait à ce récit, Maurice, foudroyé par la fatigue, après le repas goulu qu’il avait fait, venait de laisser tomber sa tête sur la table, entre ses deux bras. Un instant encore, Jean lutta, et il fut vaincu à son tour, il s’endormit, à l’autre bout. Le père Fouchard était redescendu sur la route, Honoré se trouva seul avec Silvine, assise, immobile maintenant, en face de la fenêtre toujours grande ouverte.","In spite of the attention he gave to this story, Maurice, overwhelmed with fatigue, after the greedy meal he had had, had just dropped his head on the table between his two arms. For a moment longer Jean struggled, and he was defeated in his turn, he fell asleep at the other end. Father Fouchard had gone back down to the road, Honoré found himself alone with Silvine, seated, motionless now, opposite the window, which was still wide open.","In spite of listening attentively to this story Maurice, overcome with fatigue after the voracious eating, had dropped his head between his arms on the table. Jean struggled on a little longer and then he too gave in and went off to sleep at the other end. Old Fouchard had gone down the road again, and so Honoré found himself alone with Silvine who was sitting quite still now, facing the wide open window.","Maurice's fatigue was too much for him, and notwithstanding the interest with which he listened to Silvine's narrative, after the substantial meal he had eaten he let his head decline upon the table on his crossed arms. Jean's resistance lasted a little longer, but presently he too was overcome and fell dead asleep at the other end of the table. Father Fouchard had gone and taken his position in the road again; Honore was alone with Silvine, who was seated, motionless, before the still open window."
"Un flot de terrible colère était monté soudain à la face de Jean. Lui, si calme d’habitude, toujours porté à la conciliation, avait des yeux de flamme, une voix tonnante d’autorité. Ses hommes, qui ne l’avaient jamais vu comme ça, s’arrêtèrent, surpris.","A wave of terrible anger had suddenly risen in Jean's face. He, usually so calm, always drawn to conciliation, had blazing eyes, a voice thundering with authority. His men, who had never seen him like this, stopped, surprised.","A flood of terrible rage surged up into Jean’s face. Usually so placid, always for conciliation, he now had eyes blazing and spoke with the voice of thunderous authority. His men had never seen him like this, and they stood still in amazement.","Jean's face had flushed with sudden anger. Meekest and most pacific of men, always prone to measures of conciliation, his eyes were now blazing with wrath, his voice spoke with the thunders of authority. His men had never before seen him in such a state, and they looked at one another in astonishment."

"On vit encore le général Douay passer au galop, suivi de son état-major. Il venait de se rencontrer avec le général de Wimpffen, accouru pour le supplier de tenir, ce qu’il avait cru pouvoir promettre de faire, mais à la condition formelle que le calvaire d’Illy, sur sa droite, serait défendu. Si l’on perdait la position d’Illy, il ne répondait plus de rien, la retraite devenait fatale. Le général de Wimpffen déclara que des troupes du 1er corps allaient occuper le calvaire ; et, en effet, on vit presque aussitôt un régiment de zouaves s’y établir ; de sorte que le général Douay, rassuré, consentit à envoyer la division Dumont au secours du 12e corps, très menacé. Mais, un quart d’heure plus tard, comme il revenait de constater l’attitude solide de sa gauche, il s’exclama en levant les yeux et en remarquant que le calvaire était vide : plus de zouaves, on avait abandonné le plateau, que le feu d’enfer des batteries de Fleigneux rendait d’ailleurs intenable. Et, désespéré, prévoyant le désastre, il se portait rapidement sur la droite, lorsqu’il tomba dans une déroute de la division Dumont, qui se repliait en désordre, affolée, mêlée aux débris du 1er corps. Ce dernier, après son mouvement de retraite, n’avait pu reconquérir ses positions du matin, laissant Daigny au XIIe corps saxon et Givonne à la garde prussienne, forcé de remonter vers le nord, à travers le bois de la Garenne, canonné par les batteries que l’ennemi installait sur toutes les crêtes, d’un bout à l’autre du vallon. Le terrible cercle de fer et de flammes se resserrait, une partie de la garde continuait sa marche sur Illy, de l’est à l’ouest, en tournant les coteaux ; tandis que, de l’ouest à l’est, derrière le XIe corps, maître de Saint-Menges, le Ve cheminait toujours, dépassait Fleigneux, portait sans cesse ses canons plus en avant, avec une impudente témérité, si convaincu de l’ignorance et de l’impuissance des troupes françaises, qu’il n’attendait même pas l’infanterie pour les soutenir. Il était midi, l’horizon entier s’embrasait, tonnant, croisant les feux sur le 7e et le 1er corps.","General Douay was again seen passing at a gallop, followed by his staff. He had just met with General de Wimpffen, who had come running to beg him to hold on, which he had thought he could promise to do, but on the formal condition that the Calvary of Illy, on his right, would be defended. If we lost Illy's position, he was no longer answerable for anything, retirement became fatal. General de Wimpffen declared that troops of the 1st Corps were going to occupy the Calvary; and, in fact, almost immediately a regiment of Zouaves was seen establishing itself there; so that General Douay, reassured, consented to send Dumont's division to the assistance of the 12th corps, which was very much threatened. But, a quarter of an hour later, as he came back to see the solid attitude of his left, he exclaimed, raising his eyes and noticing that the Calvary was empty: no more Zouaves, we had abandoned the plateau, which the infernal fire of the batteries of Fleigneux rendered moreover untenable. And, in despair, foreseeing the disaster, he moved rapidly to the right, when he fell into a rout of Dumont's division, which fell back in disorder, distraught, mingled with the debris of the 1st corps. The latter, after his retreat, had not been able to reconquer his positions in the morning, leaving Daigny to the XIIth Saxon corps and Givonne to the Prussian guard, forced to go up towards the north, through the wood of La Garenne, cannonaded by the batteries that the enemy installed on all the crests, from one end of the valley to the other. The terrible circle of iron and flames tightened, part of the guard continued its march on Illy, from east to west, turning the hills; while, from west to east, behind the XI Corps, master of Saint-Menges, the 5th was still advancing, passing Fleigneux, constantly carrying its guns further forward, with an impudent temerity, so convinced of the ignorance and impotence of the French troops, that he did not even expect the infantry to support them. It was noon, the entire horizon was ablaze, thundering, crossing the fires on the 7th and 1st corps.","Once again General Douay was seen galloping past, followed by his staff. He had just had a meeting with General de Wimpffen, who had hurried there to beg him to hold on, which he thought he could promise to do, but on the strict understanding that the Calvary of Illy, on his right, would be defended. If the Illy position was lost he could answer for nothing and retreat would be inevitable. General de Wimpffen declared that troops from the 1st corps were going to occupy the Calvary, and indeed almost at once a regiment of Zouaves could be seen taking it over. Hence General Douay, now reassured, agreed to send the Dumont division to support the 12th corps which was very hard pressed. But a quarter of an hour later, as he was on his way back from seeing that his left was in good shape, he uttered an oath on looking up and seeing that the Calvary was deserted, the Zouaves had gone, the plateau had been abandoned and the hellish fire from the Fleigneux batteries was in any case making it untenable. In desperation, foreseeing disaster, he was hastening towards the right when he ran into a stampede of the Dumont division falling back in disorder and panic, mixed up with the remains of the 1st corps. The latter, after its withdrawal, had not succeeded in regaining its morning positions, abandoning Daigny to the XIIth Saxon corps and Givonne to the Prussian Guard, forced northwards through the Garenne woods and bombarded by batteries the enemy was placing on every hilltop from one end of the valley to the other. The terrible ring of iron and fire was tightening, a part of the Guard was continuing its advance on Illy from east to west, rounding the hills, while from west to east, behind the XIth corps, now in possession of Saint-Menges, the Vth was steadily moving on past Fleigneux, bringing its guns further forward with insolent unconcern, so convinced of the ignorance and impotence of the French troops that it did not even wait for the infantry to support it. It was midday, and the whole skyline was ablaze, thundering and cross-firing at the 7th and 1st corps.","They had another glimpse of General Douay as he flew by at a gallop, followed by his staff. He had just had an interview with General de Wimpffen, who had ridden up to entreat him to hold his ground, which he thought he could promise to do, but only so long as the Calvary of Illy, on his right, held out; Illy once taken, he would be responsible for nothing; their defeat would be inevitable. General de Wimpffen averred that the 1st corps would look out for the position at Illy, and indeed a regiment of zouaves was presently seen to occupy the Calvary, so that General Douay, his anxiety being relieved on that score, sent Dumont's division to the assistance of the 12th corps, which was then being hard pushed. Scarcely fifteen minutes later, however, as he was returning from the left, whither he had ridden to see how affairs were looking, he was surprised, raising his eyes to the Calvary, to see it was unoccupied; there was not a zouave to be seen there, they had abandoned the plateau that was no longer tenable by reason of the terrific fire from the batteries at Fleigneux. With a despairing presentiment of impending disaster he was spurring as fast as he could to the right, when he encountered Dumont's division, flying in disorder, broken and tangled in inextricable confusion with the debris of the 1st corps. The latter, which, after its retrograde movement, had never been able to regain possession of the posts it had occupied in the morning, leaving Daigny in the hands of the XIIth Saxon corps and Givonne to the Prussian Guards, had been compelled to retreat in a northerly direction across the wood of Garenne, harassed by the batteries that the enemy had posted on every summit from one end of the valley to the other. The terrible circle of fire and flame was contracting; a portion of the Guards had continued their march on Illy, moving from east to west and turning the eminences, while from west to east, in the rear of the XIth corps, now masters of Saint-Menges, the Vth, moving steadily onward, had passed Fleigneux and with insolent temerity was constantly pushing its batteries more and more to the front, and so contemptuous were they of the ignorance and impotence of the French that they did not even wait for the infantry to come up to support their guns. It was midday; the entire horizon was aflame, concentrating its destructive fire on the 7th and 1st corps."

"Il ne put revenir que le soir, vers huit heures, après la nuit tombée. Malgré sa grande inquiétude, il était heureux : son régiment, qui ne se battait plus, venait de passer en seconde ligne, et avait reçu l’ordre de garder le quartier ; de sorte que, bivouaquant avec sa compagnie sur la place du Carrousel, il espérait pouvoir monter, chaque soir, prendre des nouvelles du blessé. Et il ne revenait pas seul, un hasard lui avait fait rencontrer l’ancien major du 106e, qu’il amenait dans un coup de désespoir, n’ayant pu trouver un autre médecin, en se disant que, tout de même, ce terrible homme, à tête de lion, était un brave homme.","He could not return until the evening, around eight o'clock, after dark. Despite his great anxiety, he was happy: his regiment, which was no longer fighting, had just passed into the second line, and had received orders to guard the quarter; so that, bivouacking with his company on the Place du Carrousel, he hoped to be able to go up every evening to hear from the wounded man. And he did not come back alone, chance had made him meet the former major of the 106th, whom he brought in a fit of despair, having been unable to find another doctor, telling himself that, all the same, this terrible man, with the head of a lion, was a good man.","It was evening, at about eight and dark, before he could come back. Although he was so worried he felt happy because his regiment was out of the fighting and had been put on the reserve, with orders to guard this district, so that as he was camping with his company in the Place du Carrousel he hoped to be able to come up every evening for news of the sick man. And he was not alone this time, for by chance he had run into the former medical officer of the 106th, and he brought him in desperation, not having been able to find any other doctor, telling himself that this terrible man with the leonine head was a good chap really.","It was dark, however, nearly eight o'clock, before he was able to redeem his promise. Notwithstanding his great distress he was happy; his regiment had been transferred from the first to the second line and assigned the task of protecting the quartier, so that, bivouacking with his company in the Place du Carrousel, he hoped to get a chance to run in each evening to see how the wounded man was getting on. And he did not return alone; as luck would have it he had fallen in with the former surgeon of the 106th and had brought him along with him, having been unable to find another doctor, consoling himself with the reflection that the terrible, big man with the lion's mane was not such a bad sort of fellow after all."
"Depuis la bataille de Sedan, il n’y avait plus de douane, tout le flot belge entrait librement ; et le vieil homme en guenilles venait de réaliser de très beaux bénéfices, ce qui ne l’empêcha pas d’avoir de grosses prétentions, lorsqu’il eut compris pourquoi l’on voulait acheter son chapeau, un feutre graisseux, troué de part en part. Il ne le lâcha que contre deux pièces de cent sous, en geignant qu’il allait sûrement s’enrhumer.","Since the battle of Sedan, there had been no more customs, the whole Belgian stream entered freely; and the old man in rags had just made very handsome profits, which did not prevent him from having big pretensions, when he understood why they wanted to buy his hat, a greasy felt hat with holes all over it. go. He only let it go for two five-franc pieces, complaining that he was sure to catch a cold.","Since the battle of Sedan the customs regulations had broken down, and all the Belgian riff-raff came in freely.

On était dans la salle à manger, il y avait du pain et de la viande sur la table ; mais il n’aurait pas eu la force de porter les morceaux à sa bouche. Un homme était là, assis sur une chaise. Puis, il reconnut Weiss, qu’il avait vu à Mulhouse. Mais il ne comprenait pas ce que l’homme disait, d’un air de chagrin, avec des gestes ralentis. Dans un lit de sangle, dressé devant le poêle, Maurice dormait déjà, la face immobile, l’air mort. Et Henriette s’empressait autour d’un divan, sur lequel on avait jeté un matelas ; elle apportait un traversin, un oreiller, des couvertures ; elle mettait, les mains promptes et savantes, des draps blancs, d’admirables draps blancs, d’un blanc de neige.","And, from that moment on, Jean lost his clear consciousness of things. We were in the dining room, there was bread and meat on the table; but he would not have had the strength to bring the pieces to his mouth. A man was there, seated on a chair. Then he recognized Weiss, whom he had seen in Mulhouse. But he did not understand what the man was saying, with an air of grief, with slow gestures. In a cot, set up in front of the stove, Maurice was already asleep, his face motionless, his expression dead. And Henriette crowded around a divan on which a mattress had been thrown; she brought a bolster, a pillow, blankets; she was putting on, with prompt and skilful hands, white sheets, wonderful white sheets, white as snow.","From that moment onwards Jean lost any clear consciousness of events. They were in the dining-room, there was bread and meat on the table, but he couldn’t even have found the strength to carry the pieces to his mouth. There was a man sitting on a chair. Then he realized it was Weiss, whom he had seen at Mulhouse. But he could not take in what the man was saying in such a worried voice and with slow, weary gestures. On a camp-bed set up in front of the stove Maurice was already fast asleep, his face motionless, looking like a corpse. Henriette was busying herself round a divan, on which she had put a mattress, and was now bringing a bolster, pillow and blankets, and then with quick skilful hands white sheets, lovely white sheets, white as snow.","That was the last moment in which Jean was distinctly conscious of what was going on about him. They were in the dining room; bread and meat were set out on the table, but for the life of him he could not have raised a morsel to his lips. A man was there, seated on a chair. Presently he knew it was Weiss, whom he had seen at Mulhausen, but he had no idea what the man was saying with such a sober, sorrowful air, with slow and emphatic gestures. Maurice was already sound asleep, with the tranquillity of death resting on his face, on a bed that had been improvised for him beside the stove, and Henriette was busying herself about a sofa on which a mattress had been thrown; she brought in a bolster, pillow and coverings; with nimble, dexterous hands she spread the white sheets, snowy white, dazzling in their whiteness."

"Mais les hommes, sans se révolter encore, la face mauvaise et muette, allaient toujours, poussant le caporal devant eux, dans le chemin étroit.","But the men, without yet revolting, with mean and mute faces, continued on, pushing the corporal ahead of them, down the narrow path.","But although the men were not yet in open revolt they walked on, grim-faced and silent, pushing the corporal ahead of them along the narrow lane.","But the men, although they did not mutiny as yet, were silent and looked ugly; they kept advancing along the narrow road, pushing the corporal before them."
"– Ce n’est pas les chandelles qui manquent, grogna Jean, ennuyé de ce plein jour.","""There's no shortage of candles,"" growled Jean, bored by this broad daylight.","‘No lack of candles,’ growled Jean, vexed at this strong light.","“One wouldn't need a candle to go to bed by here,” grumbled Jean, with whose plans the illumination promised to interfere."
"Et Jean, l’air très heureux, le tutoya aussi, avec son tranquille sourire.","And Jean, looking very happy, addressed him too, with his quiet smile.","Jean, beaming with pleasure, answered with his serene smile:","And Jean, too, looking very happy, dropped into the second person singular, with his tranquil smile."

"Au coin de la rue des Dix-Potiers, Maurice, pris d’un éblouissement, chancela. Et, comme Jean s’empressait :","At the corner of the Rue des Dix-Potiers, Maurice, seized with a dazzle, staggered. And, as Jean hastened:","At the corner of the rue des Dix-Potiers, Maurice came over faint and reeled. When Jean rushed up to him:","At the corner of the Rue Dix-Potiers Maurice had an attack of dizziness and reeled as if about to fall. To Jean, who came hastening up, he said:"
"De la main, ils se saluaient encore, cédant à la fatalité violente de cette séparation, restant quand même le cœur plein l’un de l’autre.","They still waved to each other, yielding to the violent fatality of this separation, remaining all the same with their hearts full of each other.","They went on waving to each other, yielding to the brutal fatality of this separation, but each with his heart full of the other.","They waved their hands once more in a parting salute, yielding to the fatality that decreed their separation in that manner, but each none the less securely seated in the other's heart."
"Alors, jour à jour, le mois d’octobre s’écoula, des cieux gris et tristes, où le vent ne cessait que pour ramener bientôt des vols plus sombres de nuages. La plaie de Jean se cicatrisait avec une lenteur infinie, le drain ne donnait toujours pas le pus louable, qui aurait permis au docteur de l’enlever ; et le blessé s’était beaucoup affaibli, s’obstinant à refuser toute opération, dans sa peur de rester infirme. Une attente résignée, que parfois coupaient des anxiétés brusques, sans cause précise, semblait à présent endormir la petite chambre perdue, au fond de laquelle les nouvelles n’arrivaient que lointaines, vagues, comme au réveil d’un cauchemar. L’abominable guerre, les massacres, les désastres, continuaient là-bas, quelque part, sans qu’on sût jamais la vérité vraie, sans qu’on entendît autre chose que la grande clameur sourde de la patrie égorgée. Et le vent emportait les feuilles sous le ciel livide, et il y avait de longs silences profonds, dans la campagne nue, où ne passaient que les croassements des corbeaux, annonçant un hiver rigoureux.","So, day by day, the month of October rolled by, skies gray and sad, where the wind stopped only to soon bring darker flights of clouds. Jean's wound healed with infinite slowness, the drain still did not give the commendable pus, which would have enabled the doctor to remove it; and the wounded man had become much weaker, obstinately refusing any operation, in his fear of remaining crippled. A resigned expectation, sometimes interrupted by sudden anxieties, without any precise cause, now seemed to lull the little lost room to sleep, at the bottom of which the news only arrived in the distance, vague, as if waking up from a nightmare. The abominable war, the massacres, the disasters, continued over there, somewhere, without the real truth ever being known, without anything being heard but the great dull clamor of the slaughtered fatherland. And the wind carried away the leaves under the livid sky, and there were long deep silences, in the bare countryside, where only the cawing of crows passed, announcing a harsh winter.","And so day after day the month of October went by, with dreary grey skies and the wind only giving over so as to bring up even darker banks of clouds again soon. Jean’s wound took an endless time to heal. The quality of the fluid coming from the drainage tube would not have justified the doctor’s removing it, and the patient had become very weak but refused to countenance an operation for fear of being a cripple for life. So now the little isolated room seemed to be slumbering in a period of waiting and resignation, sometimes broken by sudden anxieties with no clear cause, and the news that reached there was, remote and vague, like a nightmare from which one is just emerging. The unspeakable war, with its slaughters and disasters, was still going on somewhere out there, but they never knew the real truth or heard anything except the widespread muted clamour of their slaughtered country. The wind carried away the leaves under the dreary sky and there were long, deep silences in the bare countryside, where nothing was heard but the cawing of rooks foretelling a hard winter.","Thus, day by day, the month of October ran its course, with gray melancholy skies, and if ever the wind went down for a short space it was only to bring the clouds back in darker, heavier masses. Jean's wound was healing very slowly; the outflow from the drain was not the “laudable pus” which would have permitted the doctor to remove the appliance, and the patient was in a very enfeebled state, refusing, however, to be operated on in his dread of being left a cripple. An atmosphere of expectant resignation, disturbed at times by transient misgivings for which there was no apparent cause, pervaded the slumberous little chamber, to which the tidings from abroad came in vague, indeterminate shape, like the distorted visions of an evil dream. The hateful war, with its butcheries and disasters, was still raging out there in the world, in some quarter unknown to them, without their ever being able to learn the real course of events, without their being conscious of aught save the wails and groans that seemed to fill the air from their mangled, bleeding country. And the dead leaves rustled in the paths as the wind swept them before it beneath the gloomy sky, and over the naked fields brooded a funereal silence, broken only by the cawing of the crows, presage of a bitter winter."
"– Bon ! c’est facile, nous allons changer de pays.","- Good ! it's easy, we're going to change countries.","He tried to make a joke of it. ‘All right, that’s easy, we’ll have a change of scene.’",“Good! we'll seek another country; that's easy enough to do.”

What he must smoke good pipes, by the corner of his fire, the rich man in whose place I'm going to get my ass kicked!","‘All the same, fifteen hundred francs for this job is daylight robbery! That rich bloke I’m going to get killed for must be enjoying some lovely pipes at his fireside!’","And alluding to the sum he received as substitute: “I don't care what people say, but fifteen hundred 'balls' for a job like this is downright robbery.

We will see !","‘Yes, yes, you’re right, we’ll follow him,’ Lapoulle echoed furiously. ‘Then we shall see!’","“Yes, yes, that's the talk! we'll follow him,” Lapoulle angrily declared. “We'll see about it!”"
"– Tout d’un coup, des détonations éclatent, et l’on voit, juste en face, en avant des bois de Dieulet, des obus décrire des courbes dans le ciel… Ça m’a fait, parole d’honneur ! l’effet d’un feu d’artifice qu’on aurait tiré en plein jour… Autour de l’empereur, naturellement, on s’exclame, on s’inquiète. Mon colonel de dragons revient en courant me demander si je puis préciser où l’on se bat. Tout de suite, je dis : « C’est à Beaumont, il n’y a pas le moindre doute. » Il retourne près de l’empereur, sur les genoux duquel un aide de camp dépliait une carte. L’empereur ne voulait pas croire qu’on se battît à Beaumont. Moi, n’est-ce pas ? je ne pouvais que m’obstiner, d’autant plus que les obus marchaient dans le ciel, se rapprochant, suivant la route de Mouzon… Et alors, comme je vous vois, monsieur, j’ai vu l’empereur tourner vers moi son visage blême. Oui, il m’a regardé un instant de ses yeux troubles, pleins de défiance et de tristesse. Et puis, sa tête est retombée au-dessus de la carte, il n’a plus bougé.","– All of a sudden, detonations burst out, and we see, just opposite, in front of the woods of Dieulet, shells describe curves in the sky… That made me, word of honor! the effect of fireworks that would have been set off in broad daylight... Around the emperor, of course, people exclaimed, people worried. My colonel of dragoons comes running back to ask me if I can specify where we are fighting. Immediately, I say: “It is in Beaumont, there is not the slightest doubt. He returns to the Emperor, on whose knees an aide-de-camp was unfolding a map. The Emperor did not want to believe that there was fighting at Beaumont. Me, right? I could only persist, especially as the shells marched in the sky, getting closer, following the road to Mouzon… And then, as I see you, sir, I saw the Emperor turn his pale face. Yes, he looked at me for a moment with his troubled eyes, full of mistrust and sadness. And then, his head fell back above the map, he didn't move.","‘Suddenly there are shattering explosions, and lo and behold, right opposite, this side of Dieulet woods, shells describe parabolas in the sky… Upon my soul, it looked to me like a firework display let off in broad daylight… Naturally in the Emperor’s entourage there are exclamations, expressions of anxiety. My colonel of dragoons rushes back and asks me if I can say exactly where the fighting is. Without any hesitation I say: ‘At Beaumont, no doubt whatever.’ He returns to the Emperor, across whose knees an aide-de-camp was unfolding a map. The Emperor refused to believe they could be fighting at Beaumont. Well, I couldn’t insist, could I? Especially as the shells were careering through the sky and falling nearer, following the Mouzon road… It was then, just as I am looking at you now, sir, that I saw the Emperor turn his ashen face in my direction. Yes, he, looked at me for a moment with his lack-lustre eyes, full of mistrust and sadness. Then his head was bowed again over the map and he did not move again.’","“All at once there is a succession of sharp reports and right in front of us, over the wood of Dieulet, shells are seen circling through the air. It produced on me no more effect than a display of fireworks in broad daylight, sir, upon my word it didn't! The people about the Emperor, of course, showed a good deal of agitation and uneasiness. The colonel of dragoons comes running up again to ask if I can give them an idea whence the firing proceeds. I answer him off-hand: 'It is at Beaumont; there is not the slightest doubt about it.' He returns to the Emperor, on whose knees an aide-de-camp was unfolding a map. The Emperor was evidently of opinion that the fighting was not at Beaumont, for he sent the colonel back to me a third time. But I couldn't well do otherwise than stick to what I had said before, could I, now? the more that the shells kept flying through the air, nearer and nearer, following the line of the Mouzon road. And then, sir, as sure as I see you standing there, I saw the Emperor turn his pale face toward me. Yes sir, he looked at me a moment with those dim eyes of his, that were filled with an expression of melancholy and distrust. And then his face declined upon his map again and he made no further movement.”"

"Derrière un des premiers ormes, se tenaient Maurice et Jean. Les troncs centenaires, d’une ampleur géante, pouvaient aisément abriter deux hommes. Plus loin, le clairon Gaude avait rejoint le lieutenant Rochas, qui s’obstinait à garder le drapeau, puisqu’il ne pouvait le confier à personne ; et il l’avait posé près de lui, contre l’arbre, pendant qu’il faisait le coup de feu. Chaque tronc, d’ailleurs, était habité. Les zouaves, les chasseurs, les soldats de l’infanterie de marine, d’un bout de l’allée à l’autre, s’effaçaient, n’allongeaient la tête que pour tirer.","Behind one of the first elms stood Maurice and Jean. The hundred-year-old trunks, of a giant size, could easily shelter two men. Further on, the bugler Gaude had rejoined Lieutenant Rochas, who persisted in guarding the flag, since he could entrust it to no one; and he had laid it near him, against the tree, while he fired the shot. Each trunk, moreover, was inhabited. The zouaves, the chasseurs, the soldiers of the marine infantry, from one end of the alley to the other, stood aside, only stretching out their heads to fire.","Maurice and Jean were standing behind one of the nearest elms. The century-old trunks were gigantic and could easily provide cover for two men. Further off bugler Gaude had joined Lieutenant Rochas, who was obstinately hanging on to the flag as there was nobody to entrust it to, and he had set it down next to him against the tree while he fired his rifle. Each tree-trunk had its man, and all along the avenue Zouaves, chasseurs and marines kept behind cover except when they poked out their heads to fire.","Maurice and Jean had posted themselves behind one of the elms near the house. The gigantic trunks of the centenarian monarchs were amply sufficient to afford shelter to two men. A little way from them Gaude, the bugler, had joined forces with Lieutenant Rochas, who, unwilling to confide the flag to other hands, had rested it against the tree at his side while he handled his musket. And every trunk had its defenders; from end to end the avenue was lined with men covered, Indian fashion, by the trees, who only exposed their head when ready to fire."
"Et il tourna sur les talons, il s’en alla comme il était venu, sans qu’elle pût savoir d’où il sortait ni où il rentrait. Elle l’avait trouvé dans un trou, elle le perdit des yeux au coin d’un mur ; et jamais plus elle ne devait le revoir.","And he turned on his heels, he went away as he had come, without her being able to know where he was coming from or where he was returning to. She had found it in a hole, she lost sight of it at the corner of a wall; and she was never to see him again.","He turned on his heel and went off as he had come, without her knowing where he came from or where he was going. She had found him in a hole in the ground, she lost sight of him at the corner of a wall, and would never see him again.","He turned on his heel and was off like a shot, and she was none the wiser as to whence he came or whither he went. She had found him in a hole, she had lost sight of him at the corner of a wall, and never was she to set eyes on him again."
"Sambuc, que Ducat et Cabasse ne lâchaient pas d’une semelle, écouta, examina un instant sans répondre le vaste horizon. Et Maurice, près de lui, regardait également, saisi de l’immense déroulement des vallons et des bois. On aurait dit une mer sans fin, aux vagues énormes et lentes. Les forêts tachaient de vert sombre les terres jaunes, tandis que les coteaux lointains, sous l’ardent soleil, se noyaient dans une vapeur rousse. Et, sans qu’on aperçût rien, pas même une petite fumée au fond du ciel clair, le canon tonnait toujours, tout un fracas d’orage éloigné et grandissant.","Sambuc, whom Ducat and Cabasse did not let go of, listened, examined for a moment the vast horizon without answering. And Maurice, near him, was also watching, seized by the immense unfolding of the valleys and the woods. It looked like an endless sea, with huge, slow waves. The forests stained the yellow lands with dark green, while the distant hills, under the ardent sun, were drowned in a russet mist. And, without anyone seeing anything, not even a little smoke against the clear sky, the cannon still thundered, a distant and growing din of a storm.","Sambuc, with Ducat and Cabasse always at his heels, listened and scanned the wide horizon without answering. Maurice, who was standing by him, looked too and was impressed by the immense stretch of valleys and hills, like an endless sea with huge, slow waves. Forests made patches of dark green on the yellow earth, and in the blazing sun the distant hilltops faded into a russet haze. Although nothing could be seen, not even a single puff of smoke in the pale sky, the guns were still booming like the sound of a distant but approaching storm.","Sambuc, with Ducat and Cabasse close at his heels, listened a moment before he answered, casting his eye over the wide horizon, and Maurice, standing beside him and gazing out over the panorama of valley and forest that lay beneath him, was struck with admiration. It was like a boundless sea, whose gigantic waves had been arrested by some mighty force. In the foreground the somber verdure of the woods made splashes of sober color on the yellow of the fields, while in the brilliant sunlight the distant hills were bathed in purplish vapors. And while nothing was to be seen, not even the tiniest smoke-wreath floating on the cloudless sky, the cannon were thundering away in the distance, like the muttering of a rising storm."
"Tout de suite, un ordre étant enfin arrivé, le bataillon se porta en avant. De nouveaux flots de brume devaient monter de la Meuse, car on marchait presque à tâtons, au milieu d’une sorte de rosée blanchâtre qui tombait en pluie fine. Et Maurice eut alors une vision qui le frappa, celle du colonel de Vineuil, surgissant tout d’un coup, immobile sur son cheval, à l’angle de deux routes, lui très grand, très pâle, tel qu’un marbre de la désespérance, la bête frissonnante au froid du matin, les naseaux ouverts, tournés là-bas, vers le canon. Mais, surtout, à dix pas en arrière, flottait le drapeau du régiment, que le sous-lieutenant de service tenait, sorti déjà de son fourreau, et qui, dans la blancheur molle et mouvante des vapeurs, semblait en plein ciel de rêve, une apparition de gloire, tremblante, près de s’évanouir. L’aigle dorée était trempée d’eau, tandis que la soie des trois couleurs, où se trouvaient brodés des noms de victoire, pâlissait, enfumée, trouée d’anciennes blessures ; et il n’y avait guère que la croix d’honneur, attachée à la cravate, qui mît dans tout cet effacement l’éclat vif de ses branches d’émail.","Immediately, an order having finally arrived, the battalion moved forward. New waves of mist must have risen from the Meuse, for we were walking almost groping our way, in the midst of a kind of whitish dew which fell in fine rain. And Maurice then had a vision that struck him, that of Colonel de Vineuil, suddenly appearing, motionless on his horse, at the corner of two roads, he very tall, very pale, like a marble of the despair, the animal shivering in the cold of the morning, the open nostrils, turned over there, towards the cannon. But, above all, ten steps behind, floated the flag of the regiment, which the sub-lieutenant on duty was holding, already taken out of its sheath, and which, in the soft and moving whiteness of the vapors, seemed in the full sky of a dream, an apparition of glory, trembling, close to fainting. The golden eagle was soaked with water, while the silk of the three colors, on which were embroidered the names of victory, paled, smoked, riddled with old wounds; and there was only the cross of honour, attached to the cravat, which set in all this effacement the vivid brilliance of its enamel branches.","Immediately after that an order at last came through and the battalion moved forward. New billows of fog must have been coming up from the Meuse, for they almost groped their way along in a sort of whitish dew coming down in a fine drizzle. At that moment Maurice was struck by a vision – Colonel de Vineuil suddenly looming ahead, motionless on his horse at the junction of two roads, very tall and pale, like a marble statue of despair, his mount shivering in the morning cold with his nostrils open and turned away towards the guns. But most striking of all, ten paces to the rear the regimental flag, already out of its cover and held by the lieutenant on duty and flapping in the soft moving whiteness of the vapour, seemed to be up in a sky of dreams, an apparition of glory, trembling and on the point of vanishing away. The golden eagle was soaking wet and the silk tricolor, on which the names of victories were embroidered, looked faded and dirty, riddled with old wounds, and the only thing to stand out from all this dimness was the gleaming enamel of the arms of the cross of honour attached to the tassels.","At the same time their orders came, and the battalion moved forward. They had to proceed with caution, feeling their way, for the exhalations continued to rise from the stream and were now so dense that they were precipitated in a fine, drizzling rain. A vision rose before Maurice's eyes that impressed him deeply; it was Colonel de Vineuil, who loomed suddenly from out the mist, sitting his horse, erect and motionless, at the intersection of two roads—the man appearing of preternatural size, and so pale and rigid that he might have served a sculptor as a study for a statue of despair; the steed shivering in the raw, chill air of morning, his dilated nostrils turned in the direction of the distant firing. Some ten paces to their rear were the regimental colors, which the sous-lieutenant whose duty it was to bear them had thus early taken from their case and proudly raised aloft, and as the driving, vaporous rack eddied and swirled about them, they shone like a radiant vision of glory emblazoned on the heavens, soon to fade and vanish from the sight. Water was dripping from the gilded eagle, and the tattered, shot-riddled tri-color, on which were embroidered the names of former victories, was stained and its bright hues dimmed by the smoke of many a battlefield; the sole bit of brilliant color in all the faded splendor was the enameled cross of honor that was attached to the cravate."
"Maurice était ravi. Puis, comme il tâchait d’expliquer à Jean le mouvement de retraite qu’on allait exécuter, un cri de douleur lui échappa : son excitation était tombée, il retrouvait son pied, lourd comme du plomb, au bout de sa jambe.","Maurice was delighted. Then, as he was trying to explain to Jean the retreating movement they were about to execute, a cry of pain escaped him: his excitement had subsided, he found his foot, heavy as lead, at the end of his leg.","Maurice was overjoyed. Then, while he was trying to explain to Jean the manoeuvre of withdrawal they were going to execute, he let out a cry of pain. His state of elation had gone, and he became conscious of his foot again, like a lump of lead on the end of his leg.","Maurice was delighted. As he was endeavoring to explain to Jean the rationale of the impending movement, however, a cry of pain escaped him; his excitement had subsided, and he was again conscious of his foot, aching and burning as if it had been a ball of red-hot metal."
"Mais ce qui frappa surtout Maurice, ce fut l’attitude des conducteurs, à quinze mètres en arrière, raidis sur leurs chevaux, face à l’ennemi. Adolphe était là, large de poitrine, avec ses grosses moustaches blondes dans son visage rouge ; et il fallait vraiment un fier courage pour ne pas même battre des yeux, à regarder ainsi les obus venir droit sur soi, sans avoir seulement l’occupation de mordre ses pouces pour se distraire. Les servants qui travaillaient, eux, avaient de quoi penser à autre chose ; tandis que les conducteurs, immobiles, ne voyaient que la mort, avec tout le loisir d’y songer et de l’attendre. On les obligeait de faire face à l’ennemi, parce que, s’ils avaient tourné le dos, l’irrésistible besoin de fuite aurait pu emporter les hommes et les bêtes. À voir le danger, on le brave. Il n’y a pas d’héroïsme plus obscur ni plus grand.","But what struck Maurice above all was the attitude of the drivers, fifteen meters behind, stiffened on their horses, facing the enemy. Adolphe was there, broad-chested, with his big blond mustaches in his red face; and it really took a lot of courage not even to blink, to watch the shells come straight at you, without having only to bite your thumbs to distract yourself. The servants who were working had something else to think about; while the drivers, motionless, saw only death, with plenty of time to think about it and wait for it. They were forced to face the enemy, because if they had turned their backs, the irresistible urge to flee could have carried away men and beasts. Seeing the danger, we brave it. There is no darker or greater heroism.","But what struck Maurice most was the attitude of the drivers fifteen metres to the rear, sitting bolt upright on their horses, facing the enemy. Adolphe was there, broad-chested, with his heavy fair moustache in the middle of his red face, and you really had to be jolly brave to watch the shells coming straight at you, without batting an eyelid or even being able to bite your thumbs to take your mind off it. The gun crews who were working had something else to think about, but the drivers, motionless, could see nothing but death and had plenty of leisure to think about it and wait for it to come. They were forced to stand facing the enemy because if they had turned their backs men and beasts might have been seized by an irrestible urge to run away. Seeing the danger you face up to it. There is no heroism less in evidence or greater.","What impressed Maurice, however, more than anything else, was the attitude of the drivers, sitting straight and stiff in their saddles fifteen yards to the rear, face to the enemy. There was Adolphe, the broad-chested, with his big blond mustache across his rubicund face; and who shall tell the amount of courage a man must have to enable him to sit without winking and watch the shells coming toward him, and he not allowed even to twirl his thumbs by way of diversion! The men who served the guns had something to occupy their minds, while the drivers, condemned to immobility, had death constantly before their eyes, and plenty of leisure to speculate on probabilities. They were made to face the battlefield because, had they turned their backs to it, the coward that so often lurks at the bottom of man's nature might have got the better of them and swept away man and beast. It is the unseen danger that makes dastards of us; that which we can see we brave. The army has no more gallant set of men in its ranks than the drivers in their obscure position."
"Étranglé de chagrin, Prosper dut s’interrompre, pleurant encore lui-même. Il avala un nouveau verre de vin, il continua son histoire, en phrases coupées, incomplètes. La nuit se faisait davantage, il n’y avait plus qu’un rouge rayon de lumière, au ras du champ de bataille, projetant à l’infini l’ombre immense des chevaux morts. Lui, sans doute, était resté longtemps près du sien, incapable de s’éloigner, avec sa jambe lourde. Puis, une brusque épouvante l’avait fait marcher quand même, le besoin de ne pas être seul, de se retrouver avec des camarades, pour avoir moins peur. Ainsi, de partout, des fossés, des broussailles, de tous les coins perdus, les blessés oubliés se traînaient, tâchaient de se rejoindre, faisaient des groupes à quatre ou cinq, des petites sociétés, où il était moins dur de râler ensemble et de mourir. Ce fut ainsi que, dans le bois de la Garenne, il tomba sur deux soldats du 43e, qui n’avaient pas une égratignure, mais qui étaient là, terrés comme des lièvres, attendant la nuit. Quand ils surent qu’il connaissait les chemins, ils lui dirent leur idée, filer en Belgique, gagner la frontière à travers bois, avant le jour. Il refusa d’abord de les conduire, il aurait préféré gagner tout de suite Remilly, certain d’y trouver un refuge ; seulement, où se procurer une blouse et un pantalon ? sans compter que, du bois de la Garenne à Remilly, d’un bord de la vallée à l’autre, il ne fallait point espérer traverser les nombreuses lignes prussiennes. Aussi finit-il par consentir à servir de guide aux deux camarades. Sa jambe s’était échauffée, ils eurent la chance de se faire donner un pain dans une ferme. Neuf heures sonnèrent à un clocher lointain, comme ils se remettaient en route. Le seul grand danger qu’ils coururent, ce fut à la Chapelle, où ils se jetèrent au beau milieu d’un poste ennemi, qui prit les armes et tira dans les ténèbres, tandis que, se glissant à plat ventre, galopant à quatre pattes, ils regagnaient les taillis, sous le sifflement des balles. Dès lors, ils ne quittèrent plus les bois, l’oreille aux aguets, les mains tâtonnantes. Au détour d’un sentier, ils rampèrent, ils sautèrent aux épaules d’une sentinelle perdue, dont ils ouvrirent la gorge d’un coup de couteau. Ensuite, les chemins furent libres, ils continuèrent en riant et en sifflant. Et, vers trois heures du matin, ils arrivèrent dans un petit village belge, chez un fermier brave homme, qui, réveillé, leur ouvrit tout de suite sa grange, où ils dormirent profondément sur des bottes de foin.","Strangled with grief, Prosper had to stop, still weeping himself. He swallowed another glass of wine, he continued his story, in broken, incomplete sentences. The night was getting darker, there was only a red ray of light, level with the battlefield, projecting to infinity the immense shadow of the dead horses. He, no doubt, had remained close to his for a long time, unable to move away, with his heavy leg. Then, a sudden dread had made him walk all the same, the need not to be alone, to meet up with friends, to be less afraid. Thus, everywhere, in the ditches, in the undergrowth, in all the lost corners, the forgotten wounded were crawling, trying to join together, forming groups of four or five, small societies, where it was less hard to grumble together and to to die. It was thus that, in the Bois de la Garenne, he came across two soldiers of the 43rd, who did not have a scratch, but who were there, holed up like hares, waiting for night. When they learned that he knew the roads, they told him their idea, to go to Belgium, to reach the border through the woods, before daybreak. At first he refused to drive them, he would have preferred to reach Remilly straight away, certain of finding refuge there; only, where to get a blouse and trousers? not to mention that, from the Bois de la Garenne to Remilly, from one side of the valley to the other, there was no hope of crossing the many Prussian lines. So he ends up consenting to act as a guide for the two comrades. His leg had become hot, they were lucky enough to be given a loaf of bread at a farm. Nine o'clock struck from a distant steeple as they set off again. The only great danger they ran was at the Chapel, where they threw themselves right in the middle of an enemy post, which took up arms and fired in the darkness, while, slipping on their stomachs, galloping four paws, they returned to the thickets, under the whistle of bullets. From then on, they no longer left the woods, their ears on the alert, their hands groping. At the bend in a path, they crawled, they leaped on the shoulders of a lost sentry, whose throat they cut open with a knife. Then the paths were clear, they continued laughing and whistling. And, about three o'clock in the morning, they arrived in a small Belgian village, at the home of a good-natured farmer, who, awakened, immediately opened his barn to them, where they slept soundly on bales of hay.","Prosper had to break off, choked with sorrow and crying himself. He drank another glass of wine, then went on with his story in broken and disconnected sentences. It was getting darker and now there was nothing left but a red streak of light along the horizon over the battlefield, lengthening indefinitely the shadows of dead horses. He must have stayed a long while by his, unable to go away, with his leg gone dead. But then a sudden wave of panic had made him walk in spite of it – a desire not to be alone, to be with friends and not be so frightened. In the same way, from all sides, ditches, thickets and all sorts of odd corners, forgotten wounded men were dragging themselves along, trying to find each other, to get together in groups of four or five, little communities in which it was less terrible to share their last agonies and die. So it was that he had come across two soldiers of the 43rd in the Garenne wood, who had never had a scratch but who had gone to earth there like hares, waiting for nightfall. When they realized that he knew the lie of the land they told him their plan: to clear off into Belgium, reaching the frontier through the woods before daylight. At first he refused to take them, for he would have preferred to head for Remilly at once, knowing he could find refuge there, but where could he get a smock and some trousers from? And besides, from the Garenne wood to Remilly, from one side of the valley to the other, there was no hope of getting through the many Prussian lines. So he did agree to act as a guide to the two comrades. His leg had got some life back into it, and they were fortunate enough to get somebody at a farm to let them have some bread. They heard a distant clock strike nine as they set off again. The only place where they got into danger was at La Chapelle, where they ran right into an enemy post which rushed to arms and fired into the darkness, while they for their part tore along on all fours into some bushes amid the whistling of bullets. After that they stayed in the woods, straining their ears and groping their way. As they came round a bend in a path they crept along and then jumped on the shoulders of a lone sentry and slit his throat with a knife. After that the roads were clear and they went on their way laughing and whistling. At about three in the morning they reached a little Belgian village, woke up a kind-hearted farmer who at once let them into his barn where they slept soundly on some bundles of hay.","At this point Prosper's emotion got the better of him; tears choked his utterance and he was obliged to break off. He gulped down another glass of wine and went on with his narrative in disjointed, incomplete sentences. It kept growing darker and darker, until there was only a narrow streak of red light on the horizon at the verge of the battlefield; the shadows of the dead horses seemed to be projected across the plain to an infinite distance. The pain and stiffness in his leg kept him from moving; he must have remained for a long time beside Zephyr. Then, with his fears as an incentive, he had managed to get on his feet and hobble away; it was an imperative necessity to him not to be alone, to find comrades who would share his fears with him and make them less. Thus from every nook and corner of the battlefield, from hedges and ditches and clumps of bushes, the wounded who had been left behind dragged themselves painfully in search of companionship, forming when possible little bands of four or five, finding it less hard to agonize and die in the company of their fellow-beings. In the wood of la Garenne Prosper fell in with two men of the 43d regiment; they were not wounded, but had burrowed in the underbrush like rabbits, waiting for the coming of the night. When they learned that he was familiar with the roads they communicated to him their plan, which was to traverse the woods under cover of the darkness and make their escape into Belgium. At first he declined to share their undertaking, for he would have preferred to proceed direct to Remilly, where he was certain to find a refuge, but where was he to obtain the blouse and trousers that he required as a disguise? to say nothing of the impracticability of getting past the numerous Prussian pickets and outposts that filled the valley all the way from la Garenne to Remilly. He therefore ended by consenting to act as guide to the two comrades. His leg was less stiff than it had been, and they were so fortunate as to secure a loaf of bread at a farmhouse. Nine o'clock was striking from the church of a village in the distance as they resumed their way. The only point where they encountered any danger worth mentioning was at la Chapelle, where they fell directly into the midst of a Prussian advanced post before they were aware of it; the enemy flew to arms and blazed away into the darkness, while they, throwing themselves on the ground and alternately crawling and running until the fire slackened, ultimately regained the shelter of the trees. After that they kept to the woods, observing the utmost vigilance. At a bend in the road, they crept up behind an out-lying picket and, leaping on his back, buried a knife in his throat. Then the road was free before them and they no longer had to observe precaution; they went ahead, laughing and whistling. It was about three in the morning when they reached a little Belgian village, where they knocked up a worthy farmer, who at once opened his barn to them; they snuggled among the hay and slept soundly until morning."
"En effet, elle était très belle, dans sa pâleur, avec ses grands yeux superbes qui éclairaient tout son visage. Ses lourds cheveux noirs la coiffaient comme d’un casque de deuil éternel.","Indeed, she was very beautiful, in her pallor, with her large superb eyes which lit up her whole face. Her heavy black hair covered her like a helmet of eternal mourning.","At that moment she was indeed very beautiful, with her wonderful big eyes lighting up her pale face. Her heavy black hair was like eternal widow’s weeds.","True enough, she was very beautiful in her pallor, with her magnificent great eyes that illuminated all her face. The heavy coils of raven hair that crowned her head seemed the outward symbol of the inward sorrow that was gnawing at her heart."
"Ce fut fini presque tout de suite. Le capitaine Beaudoin, qui s’affaiblissait, retomba dans son accablement. Une sueur glacée lui inondait le front et le cou. Il rouvrit un instant les yeux, tâtonna comme s’il eût cherché une couverture imaginaire, qu’il se mit à remonter jusqu’à son menton, les mains tordues, d’un mouvement doux et entêté.","It was over almost immediately. Captain Beaudoin, who was growing weaker, relapsed into his depression. An icy sweat flooded his forehead and neck. He opened his eyes for a moment, groped as if he were looking for an imaginary blanket, which he began to pull up to his chin, his hands twisted, with a gentle and stubborn movement.",It was soon over. Captain Beaudoin was losing strength and he relapsed into his exhaustion. His forehead and neck were bathed in icy sweat. He opened his eyes again for a moment and groped as though he were feeling for an imaginary blanket that he began to pull up to his chin with a weak but determined movement of his twisted hands.,"The end came very soon. Captain Beaudoin, whose strength was ebbing rapidly, relapsed into his comatose condition, and a cold sweat broke out and stood in beads upon his neck and forehead. He opened his eyes again, and began to feebly grope about him with his stiffening fingers, as if feeling for a covering that was not there, pulling at it with a gentle, continuous movement, as if to draw it up around his shoulders."
"Le cri des sentinelles, grandi peu à peu, éclata devant lui, alla se perdre au loin. Il s’était réveillé, il se retournait sur la terre dure, lorsqu’un coup de feu déchira le grand silence. Un râle de mort, tout de suite, avait traversé la nuit noire ; et il y eut un éclaboussement d’eau, la courte lutte d’un corps qui coule à pic. Sans doute quelque malheureux qui venait de recevoir une balle en pleine poitrine, comme il tentait de se sauver, en passant la Meuse à la nage.","The cries of the sentries, gradually growing louder, burst out in front of him, went away in the distance. He had woken up, he was turning over on the hard earth, when a shot tore through the great silence. A death rattle had immediately crossed the dark night; and there was a splash of water, the short struggle of a sinking body. No doubt some unfortunate man who had just been shot in the chest as he was trying to save himself by swimming across the Meuse.","The cry of the sentries gradually grew louder and then burst into a shout right opposite him. Now wide awake, he was turning over on the hard earth when a shot tore through the silence, followed by a splashing sound and the short struggle of a body falling straight down into the water. Presumably some poor devil had been shot through the heart while trying to escape by swimming across the Meuse.","The call of the sentinels, now loud, now low, seemed to sound more faintly in his ears and to be receding in the distance, when suddenly, as he turned on his hard couch, a shot rent the deep silence. A hollow groan rose on the calm air of night, there was a splashing in the water, the brief struggle of one who sinks to rise no more. It was some poor wretch who had attempted to escape by swimming the Meuse and had received a bullet in his brain."
"– Oui, j’ai bien senti que tu savais, que tu l’avais vu… Chérie, il ne faut pas me juger sévèrement. C’est un ami ancien, je t’avais avoué ma faiblesse, à Charleville, autrefois, tu te souviens…","– Yes, I felt that you knew, that you had seen it… Honey, you must not judge me harshly. He's an old friend, I confessed my weakness to you, in Charleville, formerly, you remember...","‘Yes, I felt sure you knew, that you had seen… My dear, you mustn’t judge me too harshly. He’s an old friend, I told you about him and me at Charleville in the old days, don’t you remember?’","Darling, you must not judge me too severely. He is an old friend; I told you all about it at Charleville, long ago, you remember.”"
"– C’est donc comme là-bas, à Mulhouse ?","""So it's like over there, in Mulhouse?""",‘So it’s going to be Mulhouse all over again?’,"“It is like it was down there at Mulhausen, eh?”"
"– Mes enfants, cria M. de Vineuil, à la garde de Dieu qui n’a pas voulu de nous !","“My children,” cried M. de Vineuil, “to the care of God who did not want us!","‘Boys, you are in God’s hands, though He hasn’t found much use for us!’","“My children,” cried M. de Vineuil, “I commend you to the protection of God, who thus far has spared us all!”"
"Il y eut une rumeur. Toute la journée, des hommes s’étaient ralliés, les uns seuls, les autres par petits groupes, dans une telle bousculade, que les chefs avaient renoncé même à demander des explications. Ils fermaient les yeux, heureux encore d’accepter ceux qui voulaient bien revenir.","There was a rumor. All day, men had rallied, some singly, others in small groups, in such a jostling that the leaders had given up even asking for explanations. They closed their eyes, still happy to accept those who wanted to come back.",A buzz of conversation arose. All through the day the men had been coming back singly or in dribs and drabs and in such confusion that the officers had given up even asking for explanations. They kept their eyes shut and were glad to welcome those who consented to return.,"The camp was astir with life and bustle. All day the men had been coming in, singly and in little groups, and the crowd and confusion were such that the officers made no pretense of punishing or even reprimanding them; they accepted thankfully those who were so kind as to return and asked no questions."
"En effet, à gauche, une porte, mal fermée, bâillait ; et, par cette fente, on apercevait l’empereur, qui avait repris sa marche chancelante, de la cheminée à la fenêtre. Il piétinait, ne s’arrêtait pas, malgré d’intolérables souffrances.","In fact, on the left, a door, badly closed, was yawning; and through this slit the Emperor could be seen, who had resumed his tottering walk from the chimney to the window. He was trampling on, not stopping, despite the intolerable pain.","And indeed to his left a door was ajar, and through the opening the Emperor could be seen once again taking his faltering walk between the fireplace and the window. He kept on walking, never stopping in spite of his intolerable pain.","On the left of the corridor a door stood ajar, and through the narrow opening a glimpse could be had of the sovereign, who had resumed his weary, anguished tramp between the fireplace and the window. Back and forth he shuffled with heavy, dragging steps, and ceased not, despite his unendurable suffering."
"– Lui, un Prussien, non ! un Français, né en France !","“He, a Prussian, no! a Frenchman, born in France!","‘A Prussian, him! No! French, born in France!’ ‘A Frenchman!","“He, a Prussian, never! He's French, was born in France!” “You say he's French!"
"– L’oncle, voyons, Jean est un frère. Il s’est arraché pour moi les morceaux de la bouche. Et nous avons tant souffert ensemble !","- Uncle, come on, Jean is a brother. He tore the pieces out of his mouth for me. And we have suffered so much together!","‘Look, Uncle, Jean is like a brother to me. He went without everything for me. And we’ve been through so much together.’","“Uncle, Jean has been a brother to me; he deprived himself of food to give it to me. And we have seen such suffering together!”"
"– Oui, répondit Silvine durement.","“Yes,” replied Silvine harshly.",‘Yes.’ Silvine’s voice was hard.,"“Yes,” was Silvine's curt, stern answer."
"Il y eut un silence. Picot, le plus grand, avala un verre de vin blanc ; et, se torchant d’un revers de main :","There was a silence. Picot, the tallest, swallowed a glass of white wine; and, wiping himself with the back of his hand:","There was a pause. Picot, the tall one, swallowed a glass of white wine and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. ‘That’s a fact.","There was a brief interval of silence. Picot tossed off a glass of the white wine and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Of course,” said he."
"La Meuse, en effet, roulait des cadavres d’hommes et de chevaux. On en voyait, à chaque minute, passer, le ventre ballonné, déjà verdâtres, en décomposition. Beaucoup s’étaient arrêtés dans les herbes, sur les bords, empestant l’air, agités par le courant d’un frémissement continu. Et presque tous les soldats qui avaient bu de cette eau abominable, s’étaient trouvés pris de nausées et de dysenterie, à la suite d’affreuses coliques.","The Meuse, in fact, was rolling in the corpses of men and horses. You could see them pass by every minute, their bellies swollen, already greenish, in decomposition. Many had stopped in the grass, on the edges, stinking the air, agitated by the current of a continuous shudder. And almost all the soldiers who had drunk of this abominable water, had found themselves seized with nausea and dysentery, following dreadful colic.","It was true, the Meuse was carrying along bodies of men and horses. They could be seen floating past every minute, with swollen bellies and already decomposing and going green. Many of them had got caught in the weeds near the banks and were filling the air with stench as they constantly bobbed up and down in the water. Nearly all the soldiers who had drunk this abominable water had had sickness and dysentery after frightful colic.","They spoke the truth. The Meuse was constantly bringing down corpses of men and horses; they could be seen floating with the current at any moment of the day, swollen and of a greenish hue, in the early stages of decomposition. Often they were caught in the weeds and bushes on the bank, where they remained to poison the atmosphere, swinging to the tide with a gentle, tremulous motion that imparted to them a semblance of life. Nearly every soldier who had drunk that abominable water had suffered from nausea and colic, often succeeded afterward by dysentery."
"À deux kilomètres de Mulhouse, vers le Rhin, au milieu de la plaine fertile, le camp était dressé. Sous le jour finissant de cette soirée d’août, au ciel trouble, traversé de lourds nuages, les tentes-abris s’alignaient, les faisceaux luisaient, s’espaçaient régulièrement sur le front de bandière ; tandis que, fusils chargés, les sentinelles les gardaient, immobiles, les yeux perdus, là-bas, dans les brumes violâtres du lointain horizon, qui montaient du grand fleuve.","Two kilometers from Mulhouse, towards the Rhine, in the middle of the fertile plain, the camp was pitched. Under the waning light of this August evening, with a cloudy sky, crossed by heavy clouds, the tent-shelters lined up, the beams gleamed, spaced out regularly on the bandeau front; while, loaded guns, the sentinels watched them, motionless, staring, over there, in the violet mists of the distant horizon, which rose from the great river.","CAMP had been set up two kilometres from Mulhouse, nearer the Rhine, in the middle of the fertile plain. Towards nightfall on this August evening, under an angry sky with heavy clouds, the shelter-tents stretched out and piled arms gleamed, regularly spaced along the battle front, while the sentries with loaded rifles stood watch, motionless, their unseeing eyes staring out at the purple mists of the distant horizon rising from the river.","In the middle of the broad, fertile plain that stretches away in the direction of the Rhine, a mile and a quarter from Mulhausen, the camp was pitched. In the fitful light of the overcast August day, beneath the lowering sky that was filled with heavy drifting clouds, the long lines of squat white shelter-tents seemed to cower closer to the ground, and the muskets, stacked at regular intervals along the regimental fronts, made little spots of brightness, while over all the sentries with loaded pieces kept watch and ward, motionless as statues, straining their eyes to pierce the purplish mists that lay on the horizon and showed where the mighty river ran."
"– Tout ce que je me rappelle, c’est que la nuit déjà tombait, au moment où j’ai repris connaissance… Lorsque j’avais culbuté, en chargeant, le soleil était très haut. Depuis des heures, je devais être là, la jambe droite écrasée sous mon vieux Zéphir, qui, lui, avait reçu une balle en plein poitrail… Je vous assure que ça n’avait rien de gai, cette position-là, des tas de camarades morts, et pas un chat de vivant, et l’idée que j’allais crever moi aussi, si personne ne venait me ramasser… Doucement, j’avais tâché de dégager ma hanche ; mais impossible, Zéphir pesait bien comme les cinq cent mille diables. Il était chaud encore. Je le caressais, je l’appelais, avec des mots gentils. Et c’est ça, voyez-vous, que jamais je n’oublierai : il a rouvert les yeux, il a fait un effort pour relever sa pauvre tête, qui traînait par terre, à côté de la mienne. Alors, nous avons causé : « Mon pauvre vieux, que je lui ai dit, ce n’est pas pour te le reprocher, mais tu veux donc me voir claquer avec toi, que tu me tiens si fort ? » Naturellement, il n’a pas répondu oui. Ça n’empêche que j’ai lu dans son regard trouble la grosse peine qu’il avait de me quitter. Et je ne sais pas comment ça s’est fait, s’il l’a voulu ou si ça n’a été qu’une convulsion, mais il a eu une brusque secousse qui l’a jeté de côté. J’ai pu me mettre debout, ah ! dans un sacré état, la jambe lourde comme du plomb… N’importe, j’ai pris la tête de Zéphir entre mes bras, en continuant à lui dire des choses, tout ce qui me venait du cœur, que c’était un bon cheval, que je l’aimais bien, que je me souviendrais toujours de lui. Il m’écoutait, il paraissait si content ! Puis, il a eu encore une secousse, et il est mort, avec ses grands yeux vides, qui ne m’avaient pas quitté… Tout de même, c’est drôle, et l’on ne me croira pas : la vérité pure est pourtant qu’il avait dans les yeux de grosses larmes… Mon pauvre Zéphir, il pleurait comme un homme…","– All I remember is that it was already dark when I regained consciousness… When I had tumbled, while charging, the sun was very high. I must have been there for hours, my right leg crushed under my old Zephyr, who had been shot in the chest... dead comrades, and not a cat alive, and the idea that I was going to die too, if no one came to pick me up… Gently, I had tried to free my hip; but impossible, Zephir weighed as much as the five hundred thousand devils. It was still hot. I caressed him, I called him, with kind words. And that's what, you see, I'll never forget: he opened his eyes again, he made an effort to raise his poor head, which was hanging on the ground, next to mine. So we talked: ""My poor old man, I didn't say to him to reproach you for it, but do you want to see me smack with you, that you hold me so tight? Naturally, he didn't answer yes. Nevertheless, I read in his troubled look the great pain he had to leave me. And I don't know how it happened, if he wanted to or if it was just a convulsion, but he had a sudden jerk that threw him aside. I was able to stand up, ah! in a hell of a state, his leg heavy as lead… It doesn't matter, I took Zéphir's head in my arms, continuing to tell him things, everything that came from my heart, that he was a good horse, that I loved him, that I will always remember him. He listened to me, he seemed so happy! Then, he had another jolt, and he died, with his big empty eyes, which hadn't left me... All the same, it's funny, and no one will believe me: the pure truth is yet he had big tears in his eyes… My poor Zéphir, he was crying like a man…","‘All I can remember is that night was already falling when I came to… When I had my fall while charging, the sun was high in the sky… I must have been there for hours, with my right leg crushed under poor Zephir, who had had a bullet right in the chest… I can tell you, it wasn’t a bit funny being in that position, with heaps of dead comrades all round and not even a cat about, with the thought that I was going to peg out too unless somebody came and picked me up. I tried very carefully to get my thigh free, but no use, Zephir weighed as much as five hundred thousand devils. He was still warm. I stroked him and talked to him, calling him nice things. And this is what I shall never forget: he opened his eyes again and made an effort to lift up his poor head which was lying on the ground next to mine. So we started talking: “Well, old cock,” I said, “no offence meant, but do you want to see me kick the bucket along with you? Is that why you’re hanging on to me so hard?” Of course he didn’t answer yes, but all the same I could see in his eyes what a terrible thing it was for him to leave me. And I don’t know how it happened, whether he did it on purpose or whether it was just a spasm, but he gave a sudden jerk that shifted him to one side. I was able to stand up, but oh what a state I was in, with my leg like a lump of lead! … Never mind, I took Zephir’s head in my arms and went on saying nice things to him, anything that came from my heart, that he was a good horse, that I was very fond of him, that I would always remember him. He listened and seemed so glad! Then he gave another jerk and died, and his big, blank eyes had never left me. Still, it’s a funny thing, and nobody will believe me, and yet it is the solemn truth that he had big tears in his eyes… Poor Zephir, he was crying just like a man…’","“All that I remember is that it was beginning to be dark when I recovered consciousness. I went down while we were charging, and then the sun was very high. I must have been lying there for hours, my right leg caught under poor old Zephyr, who had received a piece of shell in the middle of his chest. There was nothing to laugh at in my position, I can tell you; the dead comrades lying around me in piles, not a living soul in sight, and the certainty that I should have to kick the bucket too unless someone came to put me on my legs again. Gently, gently, I tried to free my leg, but it was no use; Zephyr's weight must have been fully up to that of the five hundred thousand devils. He was warm still. I patted him, I spoke to him, saying all the pretty things I could think of, and here's a thing , do you see, that I shall never forget as long as I live: he opened his eyes and made an effort to raise his poor old head, which was resting on the ground beside my own. Then we had a talk together: ' Poor old fellow,' says I, 'I don't want to say a word to hurt your feelings, but you must want to see me croak with you , you hold me down so hard.' Of course he didn't say he did; he couldn't, but for all that I could read in his great sorrowful eyes how bad he felt to have to part with me. And I can't say how the thing happened, whether he intended it or whether it was part of the death struggle, but all at once he gave himself a great shake that sent him rolling away to one side. I was enabled to get on my feet once more, but ah! in what a pickle; my leg was swollen and heavy as a leg of lead. Never mind, I took Zephyr's head in my arms and kept on talking to him, telling him all the kind thoughts I had in my heart, that he was a good horse, that I loved him dearly, that I should never forget him. He listened to me, he seemed to be so pleased! Then he had another long convulsion, and so he died, with his big vacant eyes fixed on me till the last. It is very strange, though, and I don't suppose anyone will believe me; still, it is the simple truth that great, big tears were standing in his eyes. Poor old Zephyr, he cried just like a man—”"
"Weiss pleurait de grosses larmes ; et, sans répondre, il s’efforçait de détacher, de ses épaules et de ses reins, les doigts convulsifs de la malheureuse.","Weiss was crying big tears; and, without answering, he endeavored to detach from his shoulders and loins the convulsive fingers of the unfortunate woman.","Weiss was weeping bitterly, but without answering her he struggled to wrench the desperate woman’s convulsive fingers from his shoulders and waist.","Big tears were rolling down his cheeks as, without answering, he endeavored to loosen the convulsive clasp of the fingers of the poor creature he loved so dearly."

You know, there's nothing for anyone, and there's something for everyone.","‘Well, that’s a nice idea!’ protested Jean. ‘Can anyone say what he’ll get? You know there’s none for nobody and some for everybody.’","“What an idea!” Jean exclaimed; “who can tell what is going to happen him?

"Prosper continua en phrases prudentes, raconta ce qu’il avait appris dans la journée, en questionnant les uns et les autres. Personne ne doutait plus que Goliath fût un espion, qui s’était installé autrefois dans le pays, pour en connaître les routes, les ressources, les moindres façons d’être. On rappelait son séjour à la ferme du père Fouchard, la façon brusque dont il en était parti, les places qu’il avait faites ensuite, du côté de Beaumont et de Raucourt. Et, maintenant, le voilà qui était revenu, occupant à la commandature de Sedan une situation indéterminée, parcourant de nouveau les villages, comme chargé de dénoncer les uns, de taxer les autres, de veiller au bon fonctionnement des réquisitions dont on écrasait les habitants. Ce matin-là, il avait terrorisé Remilly, au sujet d’une livraison de farine, incomplète et trop lente.","Prosper continued in careful sentences, recounting what he had learned during the day, questioning each other. No one any longer doubted that Goliath was a spy, who had settled in the country in the past, to learn about the roads, the resources, the least ways of being. People remembered his stay at Father Fouchard's farm, the abrupt way in which he had left it, the places he had taken afterwards, near Beaumont and Raucourt. And now he had returned, occupying an undetermined position at the command of Sedan, again traveling through the villages, as if in charge of denouncing some, taxing others, ensuring the proper functioning of the requisitions with which the inhabitants were crushed. . That morning he had terrified Remilly about an incomplete and too slow delivery of flour.","Prosper went on, carefully choosing his words, and told her what he had found out during the day by questioning various people. Nobody now doubted that Goliath was a spy who had settled in the neighbourhood to find out about routes, resources and all the minute details of its way of life. They recalled his stay at old Fouchard’s farm, his sudden departure and the jobs he had had since round Beaumont and Raucourt. And now here he was back again, occupying some unspecified post in the commanding officer’s headquarters in Sedan and travelling round the villages, apparently employed to gather evidence against some, tax others and see that the crushing requisitions imposed on the inhabitants were being properly enforced. That morning he had been terrorizing Remilly about a delivery of flour that was incomplete and late.","Prosper went on, in words calculated to give her least alarm, and related what he had learned during the day by questioning one person and another. No one doubted now that Goliah was a spy, that he had formerly come and settled in the country with the purpose of acquainting himself with its roads, its resources, the most insignificant details pertaining to the life of its inhabitants. Men reminded one another of the time when he had worked for Father Fouchard on his farm and of his sudden disappearance; they spoke of the places he had had subsequently to that over toward Beaumont and Raucourt. And now he was back again, holding a position of some sort at the military post of Sedan, its duties apparently not very well defined, going about from one village to another, denouncing this man, fining that, keeping an eye to the filling of the requisitions that made the peasants' lives a burden to them. That very morning he had frightened the people of Remilly almost out of their wits in relation to a delivery of flour, alleging it was short in weight and had not been furnished within the specified time."

"D’un signe, le docteur Dalichamp qui suivait la scène avec un vif intérêt, empêcha Henriette de répondre. Quand Maurice aurait dormi, il serait sans doute plus calme ; et il dormit toute la journée, toute la nuit suivante, pendant plus de vingt heures, sans remuer un doigt. Seulement, à son réveil, le lendemain matin, sa résolution de partir reparut, inébranlable. Il n’avait plus la fièvre, il était sombre, inquiet, pressé d’échapper à toutes les tentations de calme qu’il sentait autour de lui. Sa sœur en larmes comprit qu’elle ne devait pas insister. Et le docteur Dalichamp, lors de sa visite, promit de faciliter la fuite, grâce aux papiers d’un aide ambulancier qui venait de mourir à Raucourt. Maurice prendrait la blouse grise, le brassard à croix rouge, et il passerait par la Belgique, pour se rabattre ensuite sur Paris, qui était ouvert encore.","With a sign, Doctor Dalichamp, who was following the scene with keen interest, prevented Henriette from answering. When Maurice had slept, he would no doubt be calmer; and he slept all day, all the following night, for more than twenty hours, without moving a finger. Only, when he awoke the next morning, his resolution to leave reappeared, unshakable. He no longer had the fever, he was gloomy, worried, in a hurry to escape all the temptations of calm that he felt around him. Her sister in tears understood that she should not insist. And Doctor Dalichamp, during his visit, promised to facilitate the escape, thanks to the papers of an ambulance attendant who had just died in Raucourt. Maurice would take the gray blouse, the armband with the red cross, and he would go through Belgium, to then fall back on Paris, which was still open.","Dr Dalichamp, who was watching the scene with keen interest, made a sign to prevent Henriette from answering. When Maurice had had some sleep he would no doubt be calmer, and indeed he did sleep all that day and the following night, for more than twenty hours without moving a finger. Nevertheless, when he woke on the following morning, his resolve to go away was still there and unshakable. There was no more feverishness, but he was gloomy, restless and anxious to escape from all the temptations to a quiet life that he felt round him. His sister wept but realized that she must not insist. And Dr Dalichamp, when he came, promised to facilitate his flight, using the papers of an ambulance man who had died at Raucourt. Maurice would put on the grey shirt and red-cross armband and go through Belgium and thence back to Paris, which was still open.","Doctor Dalichamp, who had been watching the scene with intense interest, cautioned Henriette by signal to make no reply. Maurice would doubtless be more rational after he should have slept; and sleep he did, all that day and all the succeeding night, for more than twenty hours, and never stirred hand or foot. When he awoke next morning, however, he was as inflexible as ever in his determination to go away. The fever had subsided; he was gloomy and restless, in haste to withdraw himself from influences that he feared might weaken his patriotic fervor. His sister, with many tears, made up her mind that he must be allowed to have his way, and Doctor Dalichamp, when he came to make his morning visit, promised to do what he could to facilitate the young man's escape by turning over to him the papers of a hospital attendant who had died recently at Raucourt. It was arranged that Maurice should don the gray blouse with the red cross of Geneva on its sleeve and pass through Belgium, thence to make his way as best he might to Paris, access to which was as yet uninterrupted."
"D’un hochement de tête, le père Fouchard continuait à déprécier la marchandise, qu’il affectait de trouver trop avancée.

"Beaudoin, si correct, si joliment tenu d’habitude, était en effet pitoyable, l’uniforme souillé, la face et les mains noires. Exaspéré, il venait de faire route avec des turcos, sans pouvoir s’expliquer comment il avait perdu sa compagnie. Ainsi que tous, il se mourait de faim et de fatigue ; mais ce n’était pas là son désespoir le plus cuisant, il souffrait surtout de ne pas avoir changé de chemise depuis Reims.","Beaudoin, so correct, so nicely dressed as usual, was indeed pitiful, his uniform soiled, his face and hands black. Exasperated, he had just traveled with Turcos, without being able to explain how he had lost his company. Like everyone else, he was dying of hunger and fatigue; but that was not his most burning despair, he suffered above all from not having changed his shirt since Reims.","Beaudoin, normally so correct and well groomed, was in fact in a lamentable condition, with dirty uniform and black hands and face. He was exasperated at having fallen in with some Turcos and couldn’t understand how he had lost his own company. Like everybody else, he was dropping with hunger and fatigue, but that was not what caused his most acute misery ; what put him out most of all was not having changed his shirt since Rheims.","It was but too true; the dandified Beaudoin, usually so trim and spruce, presented a sorry spectacle that morning in his soiled uniform and with his grimy face and hands. Greatly to his disgust he had had a party of Turcos for traveling companions, and could not explain how he had become separated from his company. Like all the others he was ready to drop with fatigue and hunger, but that was not what most afflicted him; he had not been able to change his linen since leaving Rheims, and was inconsolable."

"Mais Jean repartit, avec un geste de furieuse impatience. Non ! non ! maintenant qu’il était certain de retrouver Maurice, il n’irait pas coucher sur la terre dure. Et, au fond de lui, un remords l’importunait, car il revoyait le colonel, avec sa haute taille, si dur à la fatigue malgré son âge, dormant comme ses hommes, sous la tente. Tout de suite, il enfila la Grande-Rue, se perdit de nouveau dans le tumulte grandissant de la ville, finit par s’adresser à un petit garçon qui le conduisit rue Maqua.","But Jean set off again, with a gesture of furious impatience. Nope ! Nope ! now that he was certain of finding Maurice, he would not sleep on the hard ground. And, deep within him, a remorse bothered him, for he saw again the colonel, with his tall stature, so hard to fatigue in spite of his age, sleeping like his men, in the tent. Immediately, he went down the Grande-Rue, got lost again in the growing tumult of the city, ended up talking to a little boy who led him to the rue Maqua.","But Jean was off with a gesture of wild impatience. Oh no, now he was sure of finding Maurice he wasn’t going to sleep on the hard ground. But there was a slight feeling of guilt nagging inside him as he conjured up a vision of the colonel with his tall figure, a man so resistant to fatigue in spite of his age, sleeping like his men under canvas. But then he entered the Grande-Rue and finally asked a little boy who took him to the rue Maqua.","But Jean went his way, with an angry gesture of impatience. No, no! no sleeping on the hard ground for him, now that he was certain of finding Maurice. And yet he could not help feeling a twinge of remorse as he thought of the dignified old colonel, who stood fatigue so manfully in spite of his years, sharing the sufferings of his men, with no more luxurious shelter than his tent. He strode across the Grande Rue with rapid steps and soon was in the midst of the tumult and uproar of the city; there he hailed a small boy, who conducted him to the Rue Maqua."

"Et, pendant un instant, sa curiosité anxieuse, où entrait le frisson de sa peur première, eut un aliment. Il ne quittait plus du regard le sommet arrondi du mamelon, la seule bosse de terrain qu’il aperçût, dominant la ligne fuyante des vastes champs, au ras de son œil. Le Hattoy était beaucoup trop éloigné, pour qu’il y distinguât les servants des batteries que les Prussiens venaient d’y établir ; et il ne voyait en effet que les fumées, à chaque décharge, au-dessus d’un taillis, qui devait cacher les pièces. C’était, comme il en avait eu le sentiment, une chose grave, que la prise par l’ennemi de cette position, dont le général Douay avait dû abandonner la défense. Elle commandait les plateaux environnants. Tout de suite, les batteries, qui ouvraient leur feu sur la deuxième division du 7e corps, la décimèrent. Maintenant, le tir se réglait, la batterie française, près de laquelle était couchée la compagnie Beaudoin, eut coup sur coup deux servants tués. Un éclat vint même blesser un homme de cette compagnie, un fourrier dont le talon gauche fut emporté et qui se mit à pousser des hurlements de douleur, dans une sorte de folie subite.","And, for a moment, his anxious curiosity, into which entered the thrill of his first fear, had food. He never took his eyes off the rounded top of the mound, the only bump in the ground he could see, dominating the receding line of the vast fields, level with his eye. Hattoy was much too far away for him to distinguish the gunners from the batteries which the Prussians had just established there; and in fact he only saw the smoke, at each discharge, above a coppice which must have concealed the guns. It was, as he had felt, a serious matter, the capture by the enemy of this position, the defense of which General Douay had had to abandon. She commanded the surrounding plateaus. Immediately, the batteries, which opened their fire on the second division of the 7th corps, decimated it. Now the fire was being regulated, the French battery, near which the Beaudoin company was lying, had two servants killed in quick succession. A piece of shrapnel even injured a man of this company, a quartermaster whose left heel was blown off and who began to utter howls of pain, in a sort of sudden madness.","For a short time his anxious curiosity, in which there was an element of his original fear, had some real reason. He kept his eyes fixed on the round top of the hill, the only mound he could see above the flat stretch of great fields on his eye level. Le Hattoy was much too far away for him to make out the crews of the batteries the Prussians had just installed there, and all he could really see was the puffs of smoke at each discharge over a copse in which the guns must be concealed. As he had felt earlier, it was a really serious thing that the enemy had taken this position that General Douay had had to give up defending. It commanded all the surrounding plateaux. All at once the batteries opened fire on the second division of the 7th corps and decimated it. Now they were getting the range, and the French battery near which the Beaudoin company was lying had two of its crew killed in quick succession. A splinter even came and wounded one man in their own company, a quartermaster whose left heel was blown off and who began shrieking with pain as though he had suddenly gone mad.","For a moment his burning curiosity, which he was conscious was now for the first time beginning to be dashed with personal fear, had sufficient to occupy it; his gaze was riveted on the rounded summit of the mamelon, the only elevation that was within his range of vision, dominating the broad expanse of plain that lay level with his eye. Hattoy was too far distant to permit him to distinguish the gunners of the batteries that the Prussians had posted there; he could see nothing at all, in fact, save the smoke that at each discharge rose above a thin belt of woods that served to mask the guns. The enemy's occupation of the position, of which General Douay had been forced to abandon the defense, was, as Maurice had instinctively felt, an event of the gravest importance and destined to result in the most disastrous consequences; its possessors would have entire command of all the surrounding plateau. This was quickly seen to be the case, for the batteries that opened on the second division of the 7th corps did fearful execution. They had now perfected their range, and the French battery, near which Beaudoin's company was stationed, had two men killed in quick succession. A quartermaster's man in the company had his left heel carried away by a splinter and began to howl most dismally, as if visited by a sudden attack of madness."

"Bouroche avait préféré s’établir tout de suite dans Sedan, prévoyant le massacre, l’effroyable poussée qui allait y jeter les troupes. Il s’était contenté de laisser près du 7e corps, en arrière de Floing, deux ambulances volantes et de premiers secours, d’où l’on devait lui envoyer les blessés, après les avoir pansés sommairement. Toutes les escouades de brancardiers étaient là-bas, chargées de ramasser sous le feu les hommes qui tombaient, ayant avec elles le matériel des voitures et des fourgons. Et Bouroche, sauf deux de ses aides restés sur le champ de bataille, avait amené son personnel, deux majors de seconde classe et trois sous-aides, qui sans doute suffiraient aux opérations. En outre, il y avait là trois pharmaciens et une douzaine d’infirmiers.","Bouroche had preferred to establish himself at once in Sedan, foreseeing the massacre, the terrible thrust which was about to throw the troops there. He had contented himself with leaving near the 7th Corps, behind Floing, two flying and first-aid ambulances, from which the wounded were to be sent to him, after having dressed them summarily. All the squads of stretcher-bearers were there, charged with picking up the men who fell under fire, having with them the equipment of the cars and vans. And Bouroche, except for two of his aides who had remained on the battlefield, had brought along his staff, two second-class majors and three assistants, who would no doubt be sufficient for the operations. In addition, there were three pharmacists and a dozen nurses there.","Bouroche had preferred to establish himself straight away in Sedan, foreseeing the massacre and the appalling pressure that would force the troops back into the town. He had merely left, close to the 7th corps, behind Floing, two mobile ambulance units for first aid, from which the wounded could be sent on to him after emergency dressings. All the stretcher-bearing squads were out there with the job of picking up under fire any men who fell, and they had the carts and vans. And apart from two of his assistants left on the battlefield Bouroche had brought his staff, two assistant medical officers and three juniors, which might be enough to cope with the operations. In addition there were three dispensers and a dozen medical orderlies.","Bouroche had considered it would be best to establish himself in Sedan at the commencement, foreseeing the dreadful slaughter and the inevitable panic that would sooner or later drive the troops to the shelter of the ramparts. All that he had deemed it necessary to leave with the regiment was two flying ambulances and some “first aids,” that were to send him in the casualties as rapidly as possible after applying the primary dressings. The details of litter-bearers were all out there, whose duty it was to pick up the wounded under fire, and with them were the ambulance wagons and fourgons of the medical train. The two assistant-surgeons and three hospital stewards whom he had retained, leaving two assistants on the field, would doubtless be sufficient to perform what operations were necessary. He had also a corps of dressers under him."

"Brusquement, à gauche, sur une crête nue, la batterie venait de s’arrêter ; et ce fut l’affaire d’une minute, les servants sautèrent des coffres, décrochèrent les avant-trains, les conducteurs laissèrent les pièces en position, firent exécuter un demi-tour à leurs bêtes, pour se porter à quinze mètres en arrière, face à l’ennemi, immobiles. Déjà les six pièces étaient braquées, espacées largement, accouplées en trois sections que des lieutenants commandaient, toutes les six réunies sous les ordres d’un capitaine maigre et très long, qui jalonnait fâcheusement le plateau. Et l’on entendit ce capitaine crier, après qu’il eut rapidement fait son calcul :","Suddenly, on the left, on a bare crest, the battery had just stopped; and it was a matter of a minute, the servants jumped out of the chests, unhooked the limbers, the conductors left the guns in position, made their animals do a half-turn, to move fifteen meters back, facing the enemy, motionless. Already the six guns were aimed, widely spaced, coupled in three sections commanded by lieutenants, all six united under the orders of a thin and very tall captain, who punctuated the plateau annoyingly. And this captain was heard to shout, after he had quickly made his calculation:","The battery suddenly came to a halt on a bare hilltop to the left, and in a matter of a minute the gunners jumped down from their boxes and uncoupled the limbers, the drivers left the guns in position, wheeled their horses to move fifteen metres to the rear and remain motionless, facing the enemy. The six guns were already trained, spaced well apart in three pairs commanded by lieutenants, all six being under the orders of a captain, a very tall thin man who paced fussily up and down the plateau.","The battery had wheeled into position on a bare summit to the left, where it brought up all standing; then, quick as a flash, the cannoneers leaped from the chests and unhooked the limbers, and the drivers, leaving the gun in position, drove fifteen yards to the rear, where they wheeled again so as to bring team and limber face to the enemy and there remained, motionless as statues. In less time than it takes to tell it the guns were in place, with the proper intervals between them, distributed into three sections of two guns each, each section commanded by a lieutenant, and over the whole a captain, a long maypole of a man, who made a terribly conspicuous landmark on the plateau. And this captain, having first made a brief calculation, was heard to shout:"
"– Pour l’empereur tout seul, justement ! répondit-elle de son bel air de gaieté, heureuse de montrer ses dents fraîches.","""For the Emperor alone, precisely!"" she answered with her beautiful air of gaiety, happy to show her fresh teeth.","‘Yes, just that, for the Emperor all by himself,’ she answered in her jolly way, glad to be showing her white teeth.","“Yes, for the Emperor himself, and no one else!”"
"– Demain soir, il en manquera.","“Tomorrow evening, he will miss some.",‘There will be a lot missing this time tomorrow.’,“There will be one less to-morrow night.”
"– Ils n’y sont plus, ils auront dû partir.","- They are no longer there, they should have left.",‘They aren’t here. They must have gone.’,"Henriette's anxiety was aroused at sight of the open door, “They are not at home,” she said; “they must have gone away.”"
"Comme Maurice en regardait un, sur la droite, un garçon maigre et chétif, qui emportait un lourd sergent pendu à son cou, les jambes brisées, de l’air d’une fourmi laborieuse qui transporte un grain de blé trop gros, il les vit culbuter et disparaître tous les deux dans l’explosion d’un obus. Quand la fumée se fut dissipée, le sergent reparut sur le dos, sans blessure nouvelle, tandis que le brancardier gisait, le flanc ouvert. Et une autre arriva, une autre fourmi active, qui, après avoir retourné et flairé le camarade mort, reprit le blessé à son cou et l’emporta.","As Maurice looked at one, on the right, a thin, puny boy, who carried a heavy sergeant hanging from his neck, his legs broken, like an industrious ant carrying a grain of wheat too large, he saw both tumble and disappear in the explosion of a shell. When the smoke had cleared, the sergeant reappeared on his back, without fresh wounds, while the stretcher-bearer lay with his side open. And another came, another active ant, which, after turning over and sniffing the dead comrade, took the wounded man around his neck and carried him away.","As Maurice was watching one of them on his right, a puny, delicate-looking young man who was carrying a heavily-built sergeant on his back and struggling along on his tired legs like a worker ant transporting a grain of wheat too heavy for it, he saw them pitch over and vanish in a shell-burst. When the smoke had blown away the sergeant reappeared, lying on his back but with no fresh wound, while the bearer lay with his belly ripped open. And another busy ant ran up, and after turning over and examining his dead comrade he picked up the wounded man again and carried him away on his back.","Maurice saw a pair on his right, a thin, puny little fellow lugging a burly sergeant, with both legs broken, suspended from his neck; the sight reminded the young man of an ant, toiling under a burden many times larger than itself; and even as he watched them a shell burst directly in their path and they were lost to view. When the smoke cleared away the sergeant was seen lying on his back, having received no further injury, while the bearer lay beside him, disemboweled. And another came up, another toiling ant, who, when he had turned his dead comrade on his back and examined him, took the sergeant up and made off with his load."
"Ardemment, Maurice continua :","Ardently, Maurice continued:",But Maurice went on passionately:,"Maurice pursued his train of thought, speaking in hurried, eager tones."
"Vers le soir, le père Fouchard, tourmenté également dans son mutisme voulu, ne pensant guère à son fils, mais anxieux de savoir comment le malheur des autres allait tourner pour lui, était sur le pas de sa porte à voir venir les événements, lorsqu’il remarqua un grand gaillard en blouse, qui, depuis un instant, rôdait le long de la route, l’air embarrassé de sa personne. Sa surprise fut si forte, en le reconnaissant, qu’il l’appela tout haut, malgré trois Prussiens qui passaient.","Towards evening, Father Fouchard, equally tormented in his deliberate silence, hardly thinking of his son, but anxious to know how the misfortunes of others were going to turn out for him, was on his doorstep watching events come, when he noticed a tall fellow in a blouse, who for a moment had been prowling along the road, looking embarrassed about himself. His surprise was so great on recognizing him that he called him aloud, in spite of three Prussians who were passing.","Towards evening old Fouchard, also finding his self-imposed silence a torment and not giving his son much thought, but anxious to know how he might be affected by other people’s troubles, was standing at his door hoping to see something happen when he noticed a tall fellow in a smock, who had been prowling along the road for a minute or two looking very ill at ease. When he recognized him he was so surprised that he called out in spite of three passing Prussians:","Toward evening Father Fouchard, who was also haunted by a sensation of uneasiness in the midst of his studied taciturnity, was standing on his doorstep reflecting on the probable outcome of events. His son had no place in his thoughts, but he was speculating how he best might convert the misfortunes of others into fortune for himself, and as he revolved these considerations in his mind he noticed a tall, strapping young fellow, dressed in the peasant's blouse, who had been strolling up and down the road for the last minute or so, looking as if he did not know what to do with himself. His astonishment on recognizing him was so great that he called him aloud by name, notwithstanding that three Prussians happened to be passing at the time."
"Henriette avait tout vu, ces yeux mourants qui la cherchaient, ce sursaut affreux de l’agonie, cette grosse botte poussant le corps. Elle ne cria même pas, elle mordit silencieusement, furieusement, ce qu’elle put, une main que ses dents rencontrèrent. Le Bavarois jeta une plainte d’atroce douleur. Il la renversa, faillit l’assommer. Leurs visages se touchaient, jamais elle ne devait oublier cette barbe et ces cheveux rouges, éclaboussés de sang, ces yeux bleus, élargis et chavirés de rage.","Henriette had seen it all, those dying eyes searching for her, that dreadful gasp of agony, that big boot pushing the body. She didn't even scream, she bit silently, furiously, what she could, a hand that her teeth met. The Bavarian uttered a complaint of excruciating pain. He knocked her down, almost knocked her out. Their faces touched, she was never to forget that beard and that red hair, splattered with blood, those blue eyes, wide and capsized with rage.","Henriette had seen it all, the dying eyes looking for her, the dreadful spasm of his end, the heavy boot kicking his corpse. She even stopped screaming, but silently, furiously, bit whatever she could, a hand her teeth came up against. The Bavarian uttered a cry of intense pain, flung her down and nearly knocked her out. Their faces touched, and she was never to forget that red beard and hair flecked with blood, those blue eyes staring and mad with rage.","Henriette had seen the whole: the fading eyes that sought her in death, the last struggle of the strong man in agony, the brutal boot spurning the corpse. And while the Bavarian still held her in his arms, conveying her further and further from the object of her love, she uttered no cry; she set her teeth, in silent fury, into what was nearest: a human hand, it chanced to be. The soldier gave vent to a howl of anguish and dashed her to the ground; raising his uninjured fist above her head he was on the point of braining her. And for a moment their faces were in contact; she experienced a feeling of intensest loathing for the monster, and that blood-stained hair and beard, those blue eyes, dilated and brimming with hate and rage, were destined to remain forever indelibly imprinted on her memory."
"– Tiens ! cache ça, je n’en ai pas pour tout le monde.","- Take ! Hide that, I don't have one for everyone.","‘Here you are, hide it, I haven’t enough for everybody!’",“Here! don't let the others see it; I have not enough to go round.”
"– N’est-ce pas ? tu es mon petit à moi, un petit Prussien… Viens, que je t’emmène !","- Is not it ? you are my little one, a little Prussian… Come, let me take you!","Goliath got up from his chair and came over. ‘You’re my little boy, aren’t you, a little Prussian … Come along with me…!’","“You're my boy, aren't you? You're a good little Prussian. Come along with me.”"
"Malgré la terreur dont il était blême, Pache serra davantage le pain contre sa poitrine, dans son obstination de paysan affamé qui ne lâche rien de ce qui est à lui.","Despite the terror with which he was pale, Pache hugged the bread tighter to his chest, with the obstinacy of a starving peasant who never lets go of what is his.","In spite of the terror that had drained the colour from his face Pache held the bread to his chest tighter still, with the obstinacy of a hungry peasant who won’t give up anything that is his.","Despite the terror that blanched his cheeks Pache hugged the bread more closely to his bosom, with the obstinacy of the peasant who never cedes a jot or tittle of that which is his."
"Trois autres coups de canon retentirent. Puis, ce fut toute une salve. Cette fois, on avait vu une fumée monter d’un petit coteau, à gauche de Saint-Menges.","Three more cannon shots rang out. Then it was a whole salvo. This time, we had seen smoke rising from a small hill, to the left of Saint-Menges.","Three more rounds of gunfire were heard, then a whole salvo. This time they saw smoke rise from a little hill to the left of Saint-Menges.","Two more cannon shots rang out, quickly succeeded by a salvo; they detected the bluish smoke rising from the underbrush of a low hill to the left of Saint-Menges."
"– Non, non, pas là !… J’en tomberais malade, d’avoir ça longtemps sous les yeux…","– No, no, not there!… I would fall ill, to have that for a long time under my eyes…","‘No, no, not here! It’d make me ill to have all this in front of my eyes for long.’","“No, no; not here! I should be ill if I were to have that scene before my eyes for any length of time—” With a hand that trembled he pointed to the remote horizon, the hill of Hattoy, the plateaux of Floing and Illy, the wood of la Garenne, those abhorred, detested fields of slaughter and defeat."
"– Oui, c’est bien ça, je suis un paysan, tandis que vous êtes un monsieur, vous !… Et c’est pour ça que vous êtes un cochon, oui ! un sale cochon.

I’m telling you straight!’","“Yes, that's just it; I am a peasant, while you, you, are a gentleman! And it is for that reason that you are a pig! Yes! a dirty pig!

"Le vieux restait méfiant. Qu’est-ce qu’il venait faire, celui-là ? Avait-il su la visite des francs-tireurs à la ferme, la veille ? Il fallait voir. Tout de même, comme il se présentait poliment, le mieux était de lui rendre sa politesse.","The old man remained suspicious. What was he doing, that one? Had he heard of the snipers' visit to the farm the day before? You had to see. All the same, as he presented himself politely, the best thing was to return his politeness.","The old man stayed on his guard. What was this fellow up to, coming here? Had he heard about the guerrillas coming to the farm yesterday? He would have to watch it. All the same, as he was coming very civilly it would be best to be polite in return.","The old man could not rid himself of a feeling of distrust. What was the fellow after, anyway? Could he have heard of the francs-tireurs' visit to the farmhouse the night before? That was something he must try to ascertain.

"Puis, après s’être assuré qu’il n’avait pas réveillé sa mère, il s’esquiva, il disparut.","Then, after making sure he hadn't woken his mother, he slipped away, he disappeared.",After making sure that he had not awakened his mother he made his escape and disappeared.,"Then, having first assured himself that he had not disturbed his mother's slumber, he slipped away and disappeared."
"Elle s’égayait, elle ajouta :","She was laughing, she added:","She thought this was very funny, and went on:","And with her air of triumphant gayety she added: “But before he leaves he shall cause Uncle Fouchard to be set at liberty, and all his recompense for his trouble shall be a cup of tea sweetened by these fingers.”"
"Une fois encore, Lapoulle frappa à faux, n’enleva qu’une oreille au misérable cheval, qui se renversa, avec un grand cri.","Once again, Lapoulle struck falsely, taking only one ear off the wretched horse, which fell back with a loud cry.","Once again Lapoulle missed his aim and only took an ear off the wretched horse, who fell over with a loud cry.","Again Lapoulle struck ineffectually, with no other effect than to destroy an ear of the wretched creature, that threw back its head and gave utterance to a loud, shrill scream."
"– Adieu, mon garçon !","“Farewell, my boy!","‘Good-bye, my lad.’","“Good-by, my boy!”"

The fellows all say he is a tough man to deal with; depend on it he's fixing up a nasty dose for the enemy, and he'll make 'em swallow it.”"
"En levant les yeux, Jean lut sur une plaque : Avenue de la Sous-Préfecture. Au bout, il y avait un monument, dans un jardin. Et, au coin de l’avenue, il aperçut un cavalier, un chasseur d’Afrique, qu’il crut reconnaître. N’était-ce pas Prosper, le garçon de Remilly, qu’il avait vu à Vouziers, avec Maurice ? Il était descendu de son cheval, et le cheval, hagard, tremblant sur les pieds, souffrait d’une telle faim, qu’il avait allongé le cou pour manger les planches d’un fourgon, qui stationnait contre le trottoir. Depuis deux jours, les chevaux n’avaient plus reçu de rations, ils se mouraient d’épuisement. Les grosses dents faisaient un bruit de râpe, contre le bois, tandis que le chasseur d’Afrique pleurait.","Raising his eyes, Jean read on a plaque: Avenue de la Sous-Prefecture. At the end, there was a monument, in a garden. And, at the corner of the avenue, he saw a horseman, a Chasseur d'Afrique, whom he thought he recognized. Was it not Prosper, the boy from Remilly, whom he had seen at Vouziers, with Maurice? He had dismounted from his horse, and the horse, haggard, trembling on its feet, was so hungry that it had stretched out its neck to eat the planks of a wagon, which was parked against the sidewalk. For two days the horses had not received any rations, they were dying of exhaustion. The big teeth rattled against the wood as the hunter from Africa wept.","Looking up, Jean read a name-plate: Avenue de la Sous-Préfecture. At the far end there was a monument in a garden. And at the corner of the avenue he saw a cavalryman, a Chasseur d’Afrique, whom he thought he knew. Wasn’t it Prosper, the chap from Remilly he had seen at Vouziers with Maurice? The man had dismounted, and the horse, sick-looking and unsteady on his legs, was suffering so much from hunger as to be on the point of stretching his neck to eat the planks of the baggage-wagon drawn up at the kerb. The horses had had no rations for two days and were dying of exhaustion. His big teeth were grating like a file on the wood and the man was in tears.","Raising his eyes, Jean read upon a signboard: Avenue de la Sous-Prefecture. At the end of the street was a monument standing in a public garden, and at the corner of the avenue he beheld a horseman, a chasseur d'Afrique, whose face seemed familiar to him. Was it not Prosper, the young man from Remilly, whom he had seen in Maurice's company at Vouziers? Perhaps he had been sent in with dispatches. He had dismounted, and his skeleton of a horse, so weak that he could scarcely stand, was trying to satisfy his hunger by gnawing at the tail-board of an army wagon that was drawn up against the curb. There had been no forage for the animals for the last two days, and they were literally dying of starvation. The big strong teeth rasped pitifully on the woodwork of the wagon, while the soldier stood by and wept as he watched the poor brute."
"Le canon ne cessait pas, semblait avancer de l’ouest à l’est, dans un roulement ininterrompu de foudre. Et Sambuc ajouta :","The cannon did not stop, seemed to advance from west to east, in an uninterrupted roll of lightning. And Sambuc added:",The gunfire never stopped and seemed to be moving from west to east in a continuous rolling of thunder.

"Il tournait, s’assurait que rien ne manquait, ne les regardait même pas. Et, enfin, il se décida, toujours sans une parole. Brusquement, il reprit la chandelle, les laissa dans l’obscurité, en ayant le soin de refermer derrière lui la porte à clef, pour que personne ne le suivît. On l’entendit qui descendait l’escalier de la cave. Ce fut encore très long. Et, lorsqu’il revint, barricadant tout de nouveau, il posa au milieu de la table un gros pain et un fromage, dans ce silence, qui, la colère passée, n’était plus que de la politique, car on ne sait jamais où cela mène, de parler. D’ailleurs, les trois hommes se jetaient sur la nourriture, dévorant.

It was still very long. And when he came back, barricading everything again, he put a big loaf and a cheese in the middle of the table, in that silence which, the anger over, was nothing more than politics, because you never know. where it leads, to talk. Besides, the three men threw themselves on the food, devouring it. And there was only the furious noise of their jaws.","He was still going round to make sure nothing was missing, and did not even look at them. At last he made up his mind, but still never said a word. He suddenly picked up his candle and left them in the dark, taking care to lock the door behind him so that nobody could follow. They heard him going down the cellar stairs. Once again it took a very long time. When he came back, after renewed barricading, he placed in the middle of the table a large loaf and a cheese, still in the silence which, now that his anger had died down, was simply strategic, for you never know where talking might lead you. In any case the three men threw themselves at the food revenously, and the only sound now was the frenzied noise of their jaws.","He turned and looked about the room to assure himself that nothing was missing, not giving the three soldiers so much as a glance, and at last, still without a word spoken, appeared to come to a decision. He suddenly arose, took the candle and went out, leaving them in darkness and carefully closing and locking the door behind him in order that no one might follow him. They could hear his footsteps on the stairs that led to the cellar. There was another long period of waiting, and when he returned, again locking and bolting everything after him, he placed upon the table a big loaf of bread and a cheese, amid a silence which, once his anger had blown over, was merely the result of cautious cunning, for no one can ever tell what may come of too much talking. The three men threw themselves ravenously upon the food, and the only sound to be heard in the room was the fierce grinding of their jaws."

"Le vendredi soir, comme Jean s’échappait de la place du Carrousel, pour retourner rue des Orties, il assista, au bas de la rue Richelieu, à une exécution sommaire, dont il resta bouleversé. Depuis l’avant-veille, deux cours martiales fonctionnaient, la première au Luxembourg, la seconde au théâtre du Châtelet. Les condamnés de l’une étaient passés par les armes dans le jardin, tandis que l’on traînait ceux de l’autre jusqu’à la caserne Lobau, où des pelotons en permanence les fusillaient, dans la cour intérieure, presque à bout portant. Ce fut là surtout que la boucherie devint effroyable : des hommes, des enfants, condamnés sur un indice, les mains noires de poudre, les pieds simplement chaussés de souliers d’ordonnance ; des innocents dénoncés à faux, victimes de vengeances particulières, hurlant des explications, sans pouvoir se faire écouter ; des troupeaux jetés pêle-mêle sous les canons des fusils, tant de misérables à la fois, qu’il n’y avait pas des balles pour tous, et qu’il fallait achever les blessés à coups de crosse. Le sang ruisselait, des tombereaux emportaient les cadavres, du matin au soir. Et, par la ville conquise, au hasard des brusques affolements de rage vengeresse, d’autres exécutions se faisaient, devant les barricades, contre les murs des rues désertes, sur les marches des monuments. C’était ainsi que Jean venait de voir des habitants du quartier amenant une femme et deux hommes au poste qui gardait le Théâtre-Français. Les bourgeois se montraient plus féroces que les soldats, les journaux qui avaient reparu poussaient à l’extermination. Toute une foule violente s’acharnait contre la femme surtout, une de ces pétroleuses dont la peur hantait les imaginations hallucinées, qu’on accusait de rôder le soir, de se glisser le long des habitations riches, pour lancer des bidons de pétrole enflammé dans les caves. On venait, criait-on, de surprendre celle-là, accroupie devant un soupirail de la rue Sainte-Anne. Et, malgré ses protestations et ses sanglots, on la jeta, avec les deux hommes, au fond d’une tranchée de barricade qu’on n’avait pas comblée encore, on les fusilla dans ce trou de terre noire, comme des loups pris au piège. Des promeneurs regardaient, une dame s’était arrêtée avec son mari, tandis qu’un mitron, qui portait une tourte dans le voisinage, sifflait un air de chasse.","On Friday evening, as Jean was escaping from the Place du Carrousel, to return to the Rue des Orties, he witnessed, at the bottom of the Rue Richelieu, a summary execution, at which he remained stunned. Two days before, two courts-martial had been in operation, the first in the Luxembourg, the second at the Théâtre du Châtelet. The convicts of one had been shot in the garden, while those of the other were dragged to the Lobau barracks, where firing squads were constantly shooting them, in the inner courtyard, almost at point-blank range. . It was there especially that the butchery became appalling: men, children, condemned on a clue, their hands black with powder, their feet simply shod in orderly shoes; innocent people falsely denounced, victims of particular revenge, screaming explanations, without being able to be heard; herds thrown pell-mell under the barrels of guns, so many wretches at once, that there were not bullets for all, and that the wounded had to be finished off with rifle butts. Blood flowed, dump trucks carried away the corpses, from morning to evening. And, through the conquered city, in sudden panics of vengeful rage, other executions were carried out, in front of the barricades, against the walls of the deserted streets, on the steps of the monuments. It was thus that Jean had just seen the inhabitants of the quarter bringing a woman and two men to the post guarding the Théâtre-Français. The bourgeois showed themselves more ferocious than the soldiers, the newspapers which had reappeared urged extermination. A whole violent crowd raged against the woman especially, one of those petrol women whose fear haunted the hallucinated imaginations, who were accused of prowling around in the evening, of slipping past the wealthy dwellings, to throw cans of burning petrol into the The caves. Someone had just, they shouted, surprised that one, squatting in front of a window in the rue Sainte-Anne. And, in spite of her protests and her sobs, they threw her, with the two men, into the bottom of a barricade trench which had not yet been filled in, they shot them in this hole of black earth, like captured wolves. in the trap. Walkers were watching, a lady had stopped with her husband, while a baker, who was carrying a pie in the neighborhood, whistled a hunting tune.","On Friday evening, as Jean was making his escape from the Place du Carrousel to go back to the rue des Orties, he witnessed at the bottom of the rue de Richelieu a summary execution which left him thoroughly shaken. For a couple of days two courts martial had been in session, one at the Luxembourg and the other at the Théâtre du Châtelet. Those condemned by the first were shot in the garden, while the victims of the second were dragged to the Lobau barracks where full-time firing squads shot them in the courtyard at almost point-blank range. It was there in particular that the butchery was frightful: men and even children condemned on just one piece of evidence, such as hands dirty with powder or feet that happened to be wearing army boots; innocent people falsely denounced, victims of personal vendettas, screaming explanations but unable to make themselves heard; droves of people herded in front of rifle-barrels, so many poor devils at once that there were not enough bullets to go round and the wounded were finished off with the butts of the rifles. Blood ran in streams and carts were taking away the bodies from morning till night. All over the conquered city other executions were going on, wherever some personal lust for revenge found a chance, in front of barricades, against walls in empty streets, on steps of public buildings. So it was that Jean saw some people who lived in that neighbourhood bring a woman and two men to the post guarding the Théâtre Français. The ordinary citizens were more ferocious than the soldiers, and the newspapers that had resumed publication were howling for extermination. The whole mob was particularly violent against the woman, who was one of the fire-raisers, fear of whom haunted people’s over-wrought imagination, and whom they accused of prowling in the night in front of well-to-do houses and throwing cans of lighted oil into the cellars. This one had been caught, it was alleged, crouching in front of a grating in the rue Sainte-Anne. In spite of her protestations and tears she was flung with the two men into the trench of a barricade not yet filled in and they were shot in this black pit like wolves caught in a trap. People strolling by watched this, and a lady and her husband stopped for a look, while a baker’s boy delivering a pie whistled a hunting-song.","On Friday evening, as Jean was on his way from the Place du Carrousel to the Rue des Orties, he witnessed a summary execution in the Rue Richelieu that filled him with horror. For the last forty-eight hours two courts-martial had been sitting, one at the Luxembourg, the other at the Theatre du Chatelet; the prisoners convicted by the former were taken into the garden and shot, while those found guilty by the latter were dragged away to the Lobau barracks, where a platoon of soldiers that was kept there in constant attendance for the purpose mowed them down, almost at point-blank range. The scenes of slaughter there were most horrible: there were men and women who had been condemned to death on the flimsiest evidence: because they had a stain of powder on their hands, because their feet were shod with army shoes; there were innocent persons, the victims of private malice, who had been wrongfully denounced, shrieking forth their entreaties and explanations and finding no one to lend an ear to them; and all were driven pell-mell against a wall, facing the muzzles of the muskets, often so many poor wretches in the band at once that the bullets did not suffice for all and it became necessary to finish the wounded with the bayonet. From morning until night the place was streaming with blood; the tumbrils were kept busy bearing away the bodies of the dead. And throughout the length and breadth of the city, keeping pace with the revengeful clamors of the people, other executions were continually taking place, in front of barricades, against the walls in the deserted streets, on the steps of the public buildings. It was under such circumstances that Jean saw a woman and two men dragged by the residents of the quartier before the officer commanding the detachment that was guarding the Theatre Francais. The citizens showed themselves more bloodthirsty than the soldiery, and those among the newspapers that had resumed publication were howling for measures of extermination. A threatening crowd surrounded the prisoners and was particularly violent against the woman, in whom the excited bourgeois beheld one of those petroleuses who were the constant bugbear of terror-haunted imaginations, whom they accused of prowling by night, slinking along the darkened streets past the dwellings of the wealthy, to throw cans of lighted petroleum into unprotected cellars. This woman, was the cry, had been found bending over a coal-hole in the Rue Sainte-Anne. And notwithstanding her denials, accompanied by tears and supplications, she was hurled, together with the two men, to the bottom of the ditch in front of an abandoned barricade, and there, lying in the mud and slime, they were shot with as little pity as wolves caught in a trap. Some by-passers stopped and looked indifferently on the scene, among them a lady hanging on her husband's arm, while a baker's boy, who was carrying home a tart to someone in the neighborhood, whistled the refrain of a popular air."
"En effet, Maurice se les rappela alors, ces voitures et ces fourgons, tout ce train superbe de la maison impériale, qu’il avait vu à Reims.","Indeed, Maurice remembered them then, these carriages and vans, all this superb train of the imperial house, which he had seen at Reims.","Maurice then recalled those carriages and vans, all the grand paraphernalia of the imperial household he had seen at Rheims.","And then Maurice remembered; they were the imperial carriages and baggage-wagons, the entire magnificent train that he had seen at Rheims."
"Madame Delaherche avait regardé son fils baiser les cheveux de la jeune femme. Elle eut un geste, comme pour l’écarter, en songeant à l’autre, à l’homme qui avait dû baiser aussi ces cheveux-là, la nuit dernière. Mais ses vieilles mains tremblèrent, elle murmura :","Madame Delaherche had watched her son kiss the young woman's hair. She made a gesture, as if to push it away, thinking of the other, of the man who must have kissed that hair too, last night. But her old hands trembled, she murmured:","Madame Delaherche had watched her son kiss the young woman’s hair. She made a little movement as though to thrust the thing out of sight, thinking of the other one, the man who must also have kissed that hair last night. Her old hands shook and she murmured:","Mme. Delaherche had watched her son as he kissed the young woman's hair. She made a movement as if to part them, thinking of that other man who must have kissed those tresses so short a time ago; then her old hands trembled, she murmured beneath her breath:"
"Devant le clair regard du caporal, Chouteau se troubla un peu. Il lâcha la raison vraie de son insistance.","In front of the clear gaze of the corporal, Chouteau grew a little troubled.

He let out the real reason for his insistence.,"What are you up to, any way?” He flinched a little before the corporal's direct glance, and allowed the true motive of his proposal to escape him."

"La capote, jetée sur les épaules de Maurice, le sauva, et le cœur de Jean sautait à se rompre, pendant qu’ils descendaient enfin ensemble la rue Saint-Honoré. Le jour pointait à peine, des coups de feu partaient des rues transversales, car on se battait encore dans tout le quartier. Ce fut un miracle, s’ils purent atteindre la rue des Frondeurs, sans faire d’autre mauvaise rencontre. Ils n’allaient plus que très lentement, ces trois ou quatre cents mètres à parcourir semblèrent interminables. Puis, rue des Frondeurs, ils tombèrent dans un poste de communards ; mais ceux-ci, effrayés, croyant à l’arrivée de tout un régiment, prirent la fuite. Et il ne restait qu’un bout de la rue d’Argenteuil à suivre, pour être rue des Orties.","The greatcoat, thrown over Maurice's shoulders, saved him, and Jean's heart leapt to a breaking point, as they finally descended the Rue Saint-Honoré together. The day was barely breaking, shots were fired from the side streets, because there was still fighting in the whole neighborhood. It was a miracle if they were able to reach the rue des Frondeurs without having another bad encounter. They were only going very slowly, these three or four hundred meters to cover seemed interminable. Then, in the rue des Frondeurs, they fell into a post of Communards; but these, frightened, believing in the arrival of a whole regiment, fled. And there was only one end of the rue d'Argenteuil to follow, to be rue des Orties.","The greatcoat thrown over Maurice’s shoulders was his salvation, and Jean’s heart was beating wildly as at last they were going together down the rue Saint-Honoré. It was hardly light and shots could be heard in side streets, for there was still fighting going on all over the district. It was a miracle that they managed to reach the rue des Frondeurs without any other unfortunate encounter. Now they were only getting along very slowly, and the three or four hundred metres left to do seemed endless. In the rue des Frondeurs they came upon a post of Communards but the latter, thinking a whole company was on the way, took fright and ran off. Only a bit of the rue d’Argenteuil to do and they would be in the rue des Orties.","It was then that the capote which he had thrown over Maurice's shoulders stood them in good stead, and Jean's heart was beating like a trip-hammer as at last they turned into the Rue Saint-Honore. Day was just breaking, and the sound of shots reached their ears from the cross-streets, for fighting was going on still throughout the quartier. It was little short of a miracle that they finally reached the Rue des Frondeurs without sustaining any more disagreeable adventure. Their progress was extremely slow; the last four or five hundred yards appeared interminable. In the Rue des Frondeurs they struck up against a communist picket, but the federates, thinking a whole regiment was at hand, took to their heels. And now they had but a short bit of the Rue d'Argenteuil to traverse and they would be safe in the Rue des Orties."

"La nuit était très sombre, à peine distinguait-elle, en bas, le pavé de la rue des Voyards, un étroit couloir obscur, étranglé entre les vieilles maisons. Au loin, du côté du collège, il n’y avait que l’étoile fumeuse d’un réverbère. Et il montait de là un souffle salpêtré de cave, le miaulement d’un chat en colère, des pas lourds de soldat égaré. Puis, dans Sedan entier, derrière elle, c’étaient des bruits inaccoutumés, des galops brusques, des grondements continus, qui passaient comme des frissons de mort. Elle écoutait, son cœur battait à grands coups, et elle ne reconnaissait toujours point le pas de son mari, au détour de la rue.","The night was very dark, she could barely make out, below, the pavement of the rue des Voyards, a narrow, dark corridor strangled between the old houses. In the distance, on the side of the college, there was only the smoky star of a street lamp. And from there came a breath of saltpetre from the cellar, the mewing of an angry cat, the heavy footsteps of a lost soldier. Then, all over Sedan, behind her, there were unusual noises, sudden gallops, continuous rumblings, which passed like shivers of death. She listened, her heart was pounding, and she still did not recognize her husband's footsteps around the bend in the street.","It was a very dark night and she could hardly make out beneath her the cobbles of the rue des Voyards, a dark, narrow passage between the old houses. Further off, towards the school there was only the smoky star of a street lamp. From down there somewhere there came up a musty smell of cellars, the miaowing of a fighting cat, the heavy tread of some stray soldier. Then behind her, from all over Sedan, there came unusual sounds, rapid gallopings, and rumbling noises like premonitions of death. As she listened her heart thudded faster, but still she did not recognize her husband’s step round the corner.","The darkness was intense; looking downward, she could scarce discern the pavement of the Rue des Voyards, a narrow, obscure passage, overhung by old frowning mansions. Further on, in the direction of the college, a smoky street lamp burned dimly. A nitrous exhalation rose from the street; the squall of a vagrant cat; the heavy step of a belated soldier. From the city at her back came strange and alarming sounds: the patter of hurrying feet, an ominous, incessant rumbling, a muffled murmur without a name that chilled her blood. Her heart beat loudly in her bosom as she bent her ear to listen, and still she heard not the familiar echo of her husband's step at the turning of the street below."

"Goliath, qui ne pouvait remuer un doigt, tourna les yeux vers son défenseur improvisé.

"Il était quatre heures déjà, ils n’avaient rien mangé encore, par ce beau jeudi ensoleillé, lorsqu’ils eurent la joie, tout d’un coup, d’apercevoir Delaherche. Quelques bourgeois de Sedan obtenaient ainsi, à grand-peine, l’autorisation d’aller voir les prisonniers, auxquels ils portaient des provisions ; et Maurice, plusieurs fois déjà, avait dit sa surprise de n’avoir aucune nouvelle de sa sœur. Dès qu’ils reconnurent de loin Delaherche, chargé d’un panier, ayant un pain sous chaque bras, ils se ruèrent ; mais ils arrivèrent encore trop tard, une telle poussée s’était produite, que le panier et un des pains venaient d’y rester, enlevés, disparus, sans que le fabricant de drap eût pu lui-même se rendre compte de cet arrachement.","It was already four o'clock, they had not eaten anything yet, on this beautiful sunny Thursday, when they had the joy, all of a sudden, of seeing Delaherche. Some bourgeois of Sedan thus obtained, with great difficulty, the authorization to go and see the prisoners, to whom they carried provisions; and Maurice, several times already, had expressed his surprise at having heard nothing from his sister. As soon as they recognized Delaherche from afar, laden with a basket, having a loaf under each arm, they rushed; but they still arrived too late, such a push had occurred that the basket and one of the loaves had just remained there, removed, disappeared, without the cloth-maker himself having been able to realize this tearing.","It was already four in the afternoon, and they had still had nothing to eat on this lovely sunny Thursday, when to their great joy they suddenly caught sight of Delaherche. A few of the better-off people in Sedan were managing with much trouble to get an authorization to go and see prisoners and take food to them, and more than once already Maurice had expressed his surprise at having no news of his sister. As soon as they recognized Delaherche a long way off, carrying a basket and with a loaf of bread under each arm, they made a rush, but even then they reached him too late, for there had been such an immediate pushing and shoving that the basket and one of the loaves had stayed in the scrum, been wafted away, done the vanishing trick.","It was four o'clock, and they had not had a morsel to eat all that beautiful bright Thursday, when suddenly their eyes were gladdened by the sight of Delaherche. A few among the citizens of Sedan had with infinite difficulty obtained permission to visit the prisoners, to whom they carried provisions, and Maurice had on several occasions expressed his surprise at his failure to receive any tidings of his sister. As soon as they recognized Delaherche in the distance, carrying a large basket and with a loaf of bread under either arm, they darted forward fast as their legs could carry them, but even thus they were too late; a crowding, jostling mob closed in, and in the confusion the dazed manufacturer was relieved of his basket and one of his loaves, which vanished from his sight so expeditiously that he was never able to tell the manner of their disappearance."

"À gauche, c’étaient les Tuileries qui brûlaient. Dès la tombée de la nuit, les communards avaient mis le feu aux deux bouts du palais, au pavillon de Flore et au pavillon de Marsan ; et, rapidement, le feu gagnait le pavillon de l’Horloge, au centre, où était préparée toute une mine, des tonneaux de poudre entassés dans la salle des Maréchaux. En ce moment, les bâtiments intermédiaires jetaient, par leurs fenêtres crevées, des tourbillons de fumée rousse que traversaient de longues flammèches bleues. Les toits s’embrasaient, gercés de lézardes ardentes, s’entr’ouvrant, comme une terre volcanique, sous la poussée du brasier intérieur. Mais, surtout, le pavillon de Flore, allumé le premier, flambait, du rez-de-chaussée aux vastes combles, dans un ronflement formidable. Le pétrole, dont on avait enduit le parquet et les tentures, donnait aux flammes une intensité telle, qu’on voyait les fers des balcons se tordre et que les hautes cheminées monumentales éclataient, avec leurs grands soleils sculptés, d’un rouge de braise.","On the left, the Tuileries was burning. As soon as night fell, the Communards had set fire to the two ends of the palace, the Pavillon de Flore and the Pavillon de Marsan; and quickly the fire reached the Pavillon de l'Horloge, in the centre, where a whole mine was prepared, barrels of powder piled up in the Salle des Maréchaux. At this moment, the intermediate buildings were throwing up, through their broken windows, whirlwinds of reddish smoke through which passed long blue sparks. The roofs were ablaze, chapped with fiery cracks, half-opening, like volcanic earth, under the pressure of the internal brazier. But, above all, the Pavillon de Flore, which was the first to be lit, blazed, from the ground floor to the vast attic, with a tremendous roar. The kerosene, with which the parquet floor and the hangings had been coated, gave the flames such intensity that one could see the irons of the balconies twist and the tall monumental chimneys burst, with their large sculpted suns, of a red ember. .","On the left the Tuileries was burning. By nightfall the Communards had set fire to both ends of the palace, the Pavillon de Flore and the Pavillon de Marsan, and the fire was rapidly moving towards the Pavillon de l’Horloge in the middle, where a big explosive charge had been set – barrels of powder piled up in the Salle des Maréchaux. At that moment there were issuing from the broken windows of the connecting blocks whirling clouds of reddish smoke pierced by long blue tongues of fire. The roofs were catching, splitting open into blazing cracks, like volcanic earth from the pressure of the fire within. It was the Pavillon de Flore, the first to be set on fire, which was burning most fiercely, with a mighty roaring from the ground floor to the great roof. The paraffin, with which the floors and hangings had been soaked, gave the flames such an intense heat that the ironwork of balconies could be seen buckling and the tall monumental chimneys burst, with their great carved suns red-hot.","On their left the palace of the Tuileries was burning. It was not yet dark when the Communists had fired the two extremities of the structure, the Pavilion de Flore and the Pavilion de Marsan, and with rapid strides the flames had gained the Pavilion de l'Horloge in the central portion, beneath which, in the Salle des Marechaux, a mine had been prepared by stacking up casks of powder. At that moment the intervening buildings were belching from their shattered windows dense volumes of reddish smoke, streaked with long ribbons of blue flame. The roofs, yawning as does the earth in regions where volcanic agencies prevail, were seamed with great cracks through which the raging sea of fire beneath was visible. But the grandest, saddest spectacle of all was that afforded by the Pavilion de Flore, to which the torch had been earliest applied and which was ablaze from its foundation to its lofty summit, burning with a deep, fierce roar that could be heard far away. The petroleum with which the floors and hangings had been soaked gave the flames an intensity such that the ironwork of the balconies was seen to twist and writhe in the convolutions of a serpent, and the tall monumental chimneys, with their elaborate carvings, glowed with the fervor of live coals."
"– Mes enfants, les obus, on ne vous défend pas de les saluer. Quant aux balles, c’est inutile, il y en a trop !","– My children, the shells, you are not forbidden to salute them.

"Mais l’officier avait levé son épée, et les deux hommes tombèrent comme des masses, le garçon jardinier la face contre terre, l’autre, le comptable, sur le flanc, le long du mur. Celui-ci, avant d’expirer, eut une convulsion dernière, les paupières battantes, la bouche tordue. L’officier, qui s’approcha, le remua du pied, voulant s’assurer qu’il avait bien cessé de vivre.","But the officer had raised his sword, and the two men fell like masses, the boy gardener with his face to the ground, the other, the accountant, on his side, along the wall. The latter, before expiring, had a final convulsion, his eyelids fluttering, his mouth twisted. The officer, who approached, shook him with his foot, wanting to make sure that he had indeed ceased to live.","But the officer had raised his sword, and the two men fell like logs, the gardener face to the ground and the other, the accounts clerk, on his side along the wall. Before expiring he had a final convulsion, his eyelids flickered and his mouth twitched.

The frame of the latter, before he expired, contracted in a supreme convulsion, the eyelids quivered, the mouth opened as if he was about to speak. The officer came up and stirred him with his foot, to make sure that he was really dead."
"Le mois s’écoula, M. de Gartlauben fut encore amené à rendre quelques petits services. Les autorités prussiennes avaient réorganisé les services administratifs, on venait d’installer un sous-préfet allemand, ce qui n’empêchait pas d’ailleurs les vexations de continuer, bien que celui-ci se montrât relativement raisonnable. Dans les continuelles difficultés qui renaissaient entre la commandature et le conseil municipal, une des plus fréquentes était la réquisition des voitures ; et toute une grosse affaire éclata, un matin que Delaherche n’avait pu envoyer, devant la Sous-Préfecture, sa calèche attelée de deux chevaux : le maire fut un moment arrêté, lui-même serait allé le rejoindre à la citadelle, sans M. de Gartlauben, qui apaisa, d’une simple démarche, cette grande colère. Un autre jour, son intervention fit accorder un sursis à la ville, condamnée à payer trente mille francs d’amende, pour la punir des prétendus retards apportés à la reconstruction du pont de Villette, un pont détruit par les Prussiens, toute une déplorable histoire qui ruina et bouleversa Sedan. Mais ce fut surtout après la reddition de Metz que Delaherche dut une véritable reconnaissance à son hôte. L’affreuse nouvelle avait été pour les habitants comme un coup de foudre, l’anéantissement de leurs derniers espoirs ; et, dès la semaine suivante, des passages écrasants de troupes s’étaient de nouveau produits, le torrent d’hommes descendu de Metz, l’armée du prince Frédéric-Charles se dirigeant sur la Loire, celle du général Manteuffel marchant sur Amiens et sur Rouen, d’autres corps allant renforcer les assiégeants, autour de Paris. Pendant plusieurs jours, les maisons regorgèrent de soldats, les boulangeries et les boucheries furent balayées jusqu’à la dernière miette, jusqu’au dernier os, le pavé des rues garda une odeur de suint, comme après le passage des grands troupeaux migrateurs. Seule, la fabrique de la rue Maqua n’eut pas à souffrir de ce débordement de bétail humain, préservée par une main amie, désignée simplement pour héberger quelques chefs de bonne éducation.","The month passed, M. de Gartlauben was still called upon to render a few small services. The Prussian authorities had reorganized the administrative services, a German sub-prefect had just been installed, which did not prevent the vexations from continuing, although the latter appeared to be relatively reasonable. In the continual difficulties which arose between the command and the municipal council, one of the most frequent was the requisition of carriages; and a whole big affair broke out one morning when Delaherche had been unable to send his two-horse carriage to the Sub-Prefecture: the mayor was arrested for a moment, he himself would have gone to join him at the citadel, had it not been for Mme. de Gartlauben, who appeased this great anger with a simple step. Another day, his intervention had the city granted a reprieve, condemned to pay a fine of thirty thousand francs, to punish it for the alleged delays in the reconstruction of the Pont de Villette, a bridge destroyed by the Prussians, a whole deplorable story. which ruined and upset Sedan. But it was above all after the surrender of Metz that Delaherche owed true gratitude to his host. The dreadful news had been like a thunderbolt to the inhabitants, the annihilation of their last hopes; and, from the following week, crushing passages of troops had again occurred, the torrent of men descending from Metz, the army of Prince Frederic-Charles heading for the Loire, that of General Manteuffel marching on Amiens and on Rouen, other corps going to reinforce the besiegers, around Paris. For several days, the houses were overflowing with soldiers, the bakeries and butcher shops were swept away to the last crumb, to the last bone, the cobblestones of the streets still smelled of grease, as after the passage of the great migratory herds. Only the factory in rue Maqua did not have to suffer from this overflow of human cattle, preserved by a friendly hand, designated simply to house a few leaders of good education.","The month went by and von Gartlauben found occasion to render a few little services. The Prussian authorities had reorganized the administration, and a German sub-prefect had been appointed, which did not, however, prevent various annoyances from going on, although he was relatively reasonable. One of the most frequent difficulties always cropping up between the administration and the town council was the commandeering of vehicles, and a major fuss broke out one morning when Delaherche had been unable to send his carriage and two horses to the Sub-Prefecture. The mayor was put under arrest for a short time, and Delaherche would have gone to join him in the citadel had not Captain von Gartlauben taken simple steps to calm the storm. On another day, thanks to his intervention, the town was granted an extension of time when it was condemned to pay a fine of thirty thousand francs for alleged delays in the reconstruction of the Villette bridge, which had been demolished by the Prussians – a deplorable affair which ruined Sedan and filled it with consternation. But above all it was after the surrender of Metz that Delaherche was really indebted to his guest. The dreadful news had been like the trump of doom to the inhabitants, and the end of their last hopes, and by the following week overwhelming numbers of troops had appeared once again, the flood of men from Metz, the army of Prince Friedrich Karl heading for the Loire, that of General Manteuffel marching towards Amiens and Rouen, and other corps on their way to reinforce the armies besieging Paris. For some days the houses were crammed with soldiery, bakers and butchers were cleaned out to the last crumb and bone, and the streets reeked of sweat as though a huge migrating herd had passed through. The factory in the rue Maqua alone did not have to suffer from this flow of human cattle, for it was preserved by a friendly hand and classified only for lodging a few officers of good breeding.","Toward the close of the month M. de Gartlauben was in position to render some further trifling services. The Prussian authorities, in the course of sundry administrative reforms inaugurated by them, had appointed a German Sous-Prefect, and although this step did not put an end to the exactions to which the city was subjected, the new official showed himself to be comparatively reasonable. One of the most frequent among the causes of difference that were constantly springing up between the officers of the post and the municipal council was that which arose from the custom of requisitioning carriages for the use of the staff, and there was a great hullaballoo raised one morning that Delaherche failed to send his caleche and pair to the Sous-Prefecture: the mayor was arrested and the manufacturer would have gone to keep him company up in the citadel had it not been for M. de Gartlauben, who promptly quelled the rising storm. Another day he secured a stay of proceedings for the city, which had been mulcted in the sum of thirty thousand francs to punish it for its alleged dilatoriness in rebuilding the bridge of Villette, a bridge that the Prussians themselves had destroyed: a disastrous piece of business that was near being the ruin of Sedan. It was after the surrender at Metz, however, that Delaherche contracted his main debt of gratitude to his guest. The terrible news burst on the citizens like a thunderclap, dashing to the ground all their remaining hopes, and early in the ensuing week the streets again began to be encumbered with the countless hosts of the German forces, streaming down from the conquered fortress: the army of Prince Frederick Charles moving on the Loire, that of General Manteuffel, whose destination was Amiens and Rouen, and other corps on the march to reinforce the besiegers before Paris. For several days the houses were full to overflowing with soldiers, the butchers' and bakers' shops were swept clean, to the last bone, to the last crumb; the streets were pervaded by a greasy, tallowy odor, as after the passage of the great migratory bands of olden times. The buildings in the Rue Maqua, protected by a friendly influence, escaped the devastating irruption, and were only called on to give shelter to a few of the leaders, men of education and refinement."
"– Ah ! oui, Dieu merci ! fini tout à fait… La capitulation doit être signée à cette heure.","– Ah! Yes, thank God ! finished completely… The capitulation must be signed at this hour.","‘Yes, thank God, all quite over… The capitulation must be signed by now.’","“Ah, yes, God be praised! it is all over, completely over.

"Et, regardant les autres morts, en travers de l’allée, au pied des arbres, dans les pelouses, cette trentaine de braves parmi lesquels le corps du lieutenant Rochas gisait, troué de blessures, enveloppé du drapeau, il ajouta d’un air sérieux de grand respect :","And, looking at the other dead, across the alley, at the foot of the trees, in the lawns, these thirty brave men among whom the body of Lieutenant Rochas lay, riddled with wounds, wrapped in the flag, he added with an air of seriousness of great respect:","He looked at the other dead, lying all over the avenue, under trees and on the grass, thirty or so brave fellows amongst whom lay the body of Lieutenant Rochas, riddled with bullets and wrapped in the flag, and he went on in a serious voice and with great respect:","And casting a look at the other dead who lay scattered about the avenue, under the trees and on the turf, some thirty brave fellows, among them Lieutenant Rochas, riddled with wounds and surrounded still by the shreds of the flag, he added seriously and with great respect: “There must have been some very pretty fighting about here!"

Finally a very old woman appeared at the door, some old servant left behind and kept there by her bad legs.","The farmer's people had apparently taken to the woods.

You don't know, you all, what we would do, if we were good buggers?... Later, when we land, we would spin, yes! we would slip away quietly, leaving that big pig Badinguet and all his clique of four-penny generals to wash their faces as they liked with their filthy Prussians!","‘The police! Coo, listen to him! Fuck the police! Don’t you know, all you chaps, what we should do if we had any sense? When they unload us later on we should piss off – yes, just quietly slope off! And leave that great swine Badinguet and all his crew of tuppenny-ha’penny generals to work it out as they like with their bloody Prussians!’","“Oh, indeed, the gendarmes! let the gendarmes go milk the ducks!—say , do you know what we would do, all of us, if we had the least bit of spirit? I'll tell you; just the minute that they land us from the cars we'd skip; yes, we'd go straight home, and leave that pig of a Badinguet and his gang of two-for-a-penny generals to settle accounts with their beastly Prussians as best they may!”"
"Les clairons sonnaient la levée du camp, et ils durent courir pour regagner chacun sa tente. D’ailleurs, les préparatifs du départ traînèrent, les troupes, sac au dos, attendirent jusqu’à près de neuf heures. Une incertitude semblait avoir pris les chefs, ce n’était déjà plus la belle résolution des deux premiers jours, ces soixante kilomètres que le 7e corps avait franchis en deux étapes. Et une nouvelle singulière, inquiétante, circulait depuis le matin : la marche vers le nord des trois autres corps d’armée, le 1er à Juniville, le 5e et le 12e à Rethel, marche illogique, que l’on expliquait par des besoins d’approvisionnements. On ne se dirigeait donc plus sur Verdun ? pourquoi cette journée perdue ? Le pis était que les Prussiens ne devaient pas être loin, maintenant, car les officiers venaient d’avertir leurs hommes de ne pas s’attarder, tout traînard pouvant être enlevé par les reconnaissances de la cavalerie ennemie.","The bugles sounded the breaking of camp, and they had to run to get back to their tents. Moreover, the preparations for departure dragged on, the troops, backpacks, waited until nearly nine o'clock. An uncertainty seemed to have seized the leaders, it was already no longer the fine resolution of the first two days, these sixty kilometers that the 7th corps had covered in two stages. And singular, disturbing news had been circulating since the morning: the march towards the north of the three other army corps, the 1st at Juniville, the 5th and the 12th at Rethel, an illogical march, which was explained by the needs of supplies. So we were no longer heading for Verdun? why this wasted day? The worst was that the Prussians must not be far now, for the officers had just warned their men not to linger, as any stragglers might be picked off by reconnoitring enemy cavalry.","The bugles sounded for striking camp, and they had to run to get back to their own tents. As a matter of fact the preparations for departure were held up, and the troops waited about with full kit on until nearly nine. The commanders seemed to be in some uncertainty, and already the fine determination of the first two days had gone, when the 7th corps had covered sixty kilometres in two stages. And a fresh piece of news, rather strange and alarming, had been going the rounds since first thing: the march northwards of the three other army corps, the 1st to Juniville, the 5th and 12th to Rethel, was quite illogical, and it was being explained by lack of supplies. Weren’t they making for Verdun, then? Why a day lost? The worst thing was that the Prussians couldn’t be far away now, for the officers came and warned the men not to lag behind because any laggard was liable to be picked up by reconnoitring enemy cavalry.","The bugles were sounding the signal to prepare for breaking camp, and each had to hurry away to rejoin his command. The preparations for departure dragged, however, and the troops had to stand waiting in heavy marching order until nearly nine o'clock. A feeling of hesitancy seemed to have taken possession of their leaders; there was not the resolute alacrity of the first two days, when the 7th corps had accomplished forty miles in two marches. Strange and alarming news, moreover, had been circulating through the camp since morning, that the three other corps were marching northward, the 1st at Juniville, the 5th and 12th at Rethel, and this deviation from their route was accounted for on the ground of the necessities of the commissariat. Montmedy had ceased to be their objective, then? why were they thus idling away their time again? What was most alarming of all was that the Prussians could not now be far away, for the officers had cautioned their men not to fall behind the column, as all stragglers were liable to be picked up by the enemy's light cavalry."
"Des faces anxieuses se tournaient vers Jean, l’escouade l’avait attendu, Lapoulle et Pache surtout, malchanceux, n’ayant rien attrapé, comptant sur lui, qui aurait tiré de la farine des pierres, comme ils disaient. Et Jean, apitoyé, la conscience bourrelée d’avoir abandonné ses hommes, leur partagea la moitié de pain qu’il avait dans son sac.","Anxious faces turned towards Jean, the squad had been waiting for him, Lapoulle and Pache above all, unlucky, having caught nothing, counting on him, who would have pulled flour from the stones, as they said. And Jean, feeling sorry for himself, his conscience tormented at having abandoned his men, shared with them the half of the bread he had in his bag.","Anxious faces looked towards Jean, the squad had been waiting, especially Lapoulle and Pache, the unlucky ones, who hadn’t picked anything up, counting on him, for he could have got flour out of a stone, as they put it. So Jean, moved with pity and conscience-stricken at having abandoned his men, divided between them the half loaf he had in his pack.","You were not at distribution, then?” Jean beheld a circle of expectant eyes bent on him; the squad had been waiting for him with anxiety, Pache and Lapoulle in particular, luckless dogs, who had found nothing they could appropriate; they all relied on him, who, as they expressed it, could get bread out of a stone. And the corporal's conscience smote him for having abandoned his men; he took pity on them and divided among them half the bread that he had in his sack."
"Cela ne dura pas trois secondes. Weiss, dont le binocle avait glissé, dans les adieux, venait de le remettre vivement sur son nez, comme s’il avait voulu bien voir la mort en face. Il recula, s’adossa contre le mur, en croisant les bras ; et, dans son veston en lambeaux, ce gros garçon paisible avait une figure exaltée, d’une admirable beauté de courage. Près de lui, Laurent s’était contenté de fourrer les mains dans ses poches. Il semblait indigné de la cruelle scène, de l’abomination de ces sauvages qui tuaient les hommes sous les yeux de leurs femmes. Il se redressa, les dévisagea, leur cracha d’une voix de mépris :","It didn't last three seconds. Weiss, whose binoculars had slipped off during the farewell, had just quickly put them back on his nose, as if he wanted to see death in the face. He stepped back, leaned against the wall, crossing his arms; and, in his ragged jacket, this fat, peaceful boy had an exalted face, of an admirable beauty of courage. Beside him, Laurent had contented himself with stuffing his hands in his pockets. He seemed indignant at the cruel scene, at the abomination of these savages who killed men under the eyes of their wives. He sat up, stared at them, spat at them in a voice of contempt:","It lasted less than three seconds. Weiss’s folding glasses had slipped down during the parting, and he quickly replaced them on his nose as though he wanted to look death squarely in the face. He backed against the wall and folded his arms, and the face of this big, good-natured fellow in his tattered jacket shone with radiance, admirable in beauty and courage. Next to him Laurent had simply thrust his hands into his pockets. He looked outraged at this cruel scene, the abomination of these savages killing men before the eyes of their wives. He drew himself up, looked at them insolently and spat out in contempt:","It lasted not five seconds. Weiss, whose eye-glass had slipped from its position in the agitation of their parting, quickly replaced it upon his nose, as if desirous to look death in the face. He stepped back and placed himself against the wall, and the face of the self-contained, strong young man, as he stood there in his tattered coat, was sublimely beautiful in its expression of tranquil courage. Laurent, who stood beside him, had thrust his hands deep down into his pockets. The cold cruelty of the proceeding disgusted him; it seemed to him that they could not be far removed from savagery who could thus slaughter men before the eyes of their wives. He drew himself up, looked them square in the face, and in a tone of deepest contempt expectorated:"
"Vers une heure du matin, Maurice que la fatigue avait assoupi, se réveilla au milieu d’un véritable lac. Les rigoles, enflées par les averses, venaient de déborder, submergeant le terrain où il s’était étendu. Chouteau et Loubet juraient de colère, tandis que Pache secouait Lapoulle, qui dormait quand même à poings fermés, dans cette noyade. Alors, Jean, ayant songé aux peupliers plantés le long du canal, courut s’y abriter, avec ses hommes, qui achevèrent là cette nuit affreuse, à demi ployés, le dos contre l’écorce, les jambes ramenées sous eux, pour les garer des grosses gouttes.","About one o'clock in the morning, Maurice, who had been drowsy from fatigue, awoke in the middle of a real lake. The gullies, swollen by the showers, had just overflowed, submerging the ground where it had spread. Chouteau and Loubet were swearing angrily, while Pache was shaking Lapoulle, who was still sound asleep in this drowning. Then Jean, having thought of the poplars planted along the canal, ran to take shelter there with his men, who ended that dreadful night there, half bent, their backs against the bark, their legs tucked under them, for the park large drops.","At about one in the morning Maurice, who had dozed off exhausted, woke up in an absolute lake. The ditches, swollen by the rain, had overflowed and submerged the ground on which he was lying. Chouteau and Loubet were swearing with rage and Pache was shaking Lapoulle who was sleeping on like a log, lake or no lake. Then Jean remembered the poplars along the canal and ran to take shelter under them with his men, who spent the rest of that fearful night bent nearly double with their backs against the tree trunks and legs bent up under them to avoid the heaviest of the drips.","About one o'clock Maurice, who had been sleeping soundly as a result of his fatigue, awoke and found himself in the middle of a miniature lake. The trenches, swollen by the heavy downpour, had overflowed and inundated the ground where he lay. Chouteau's and Loubet's wrath vented itself in a volley of maledictions, while Pache shook Lapoulle, who, unmindful of his ducking, slept through it all as if he was never to wake again. Then Jean, remembering the row of poplars on the bank of the canal, collected his little band and ran thither for shelter; and there they passed the remainder of that wretched night, crouching with their backs to the trees, their legs doubled under them, so as to expose as little of their persons as might be to the big drops."

"Mais, à ce moment, sur la crête du coteau, un officier parut, à cheval, blessé, et que deux hommes soutenaient. On ne le reconnut pas d’abord. Puis, un grondement s’éleva, roula en une clameur furieuse. C’était le général Margueritte, dont une balle venait de traverser les joues, et qui devait en mourir. Il ne pouvait parler, il agita le bras, là-bas, vers l’ennemi.","But at this moment, on the crest of the hill, an officer appeared on horseback, wounded, and supported by two men.

He couldn't speak, he waved his arm over there at the enemy.","Just then an officer appeared over the brow of the hill, on his horse, wounded and supported by two men. At first they did not recognize him. Then a muttering began, which spread into a deafening clamour. It was General Margueritte, shot through the jaw by a bullet and near to death. He could not speak. He waved his arm towards the enemy.","At that juncture, however, an officer appeared coming over the crest of the hill in front, wounded, and preserving his seat in the saddle only by the assistance of a man on either side. No one recognized him at first, but presently a deep, ominous murmur began to run from squadron to squadron, which quickly swelled into a furious uproar. It was General Margueritte, who had received a wound from which he died a few days later; a musket-ball had passed through both cheeks, carrying away a portion of the tongue and palate. He was incapable of speech, but waved his arm in the direction of the enemy."
"Descendu de cheval, Prosper s’étira, flatta Zéphir de la main. Ce pauvre Zéphir, il était aussi abruti que son maître, éreinté du bête de métier qu’on lui faisait faire. Avec ça, il portait un monde : le linge dans les fontes et le manteau roulé par-dessus, la blouse, le pantalon, le bissac avec les objets de pansage, derrière la selle, et en travers encore le sac des vivres, sans compter la peau de bouc, le bidon, la gamelle. Une pitié tendre noyait le cœur du cavalier, tandis qu’il serrait les sangles et qu’il s’assurait que tout cela tenait bien.","Dismounting, Prosper stretched himself, patted Zephyr with his hand. This poor Zephir, he was as stupid as his master, exhausted by the beast of a trade he was being made to do. With that, he carried a whole world: the linen in the holsters and the coat rolled up over it, the blouse, the trousers, the backpack with the grooming objects, behind the saddle, and still across the bag of provisions, not to mention the goatskin, the can, the bowl. Tender pity drowned the rider's heart as he tightened the straps and made sure it was all in place.","Prosper dismounted, stretched himself and stroked Zephir. Poor Zephir! He was as woebegone as his master, worn out with the silly job he was being made to do. Added to that, he was being made to carry a whole world of stuff: clothing in the saddlebags and rolled coat on top, shirt, trousers, knapsack with medical supplies behind the saddle, and slung across him the bag with provisions, to say nothing of the water-bottle, can and messtin. The rider’s heart was filled with pity and affection as he tightened the straps and made sure everything was secure.","Prosper alighted, stretched his cramped limbs, and gave Zephyr a friendly pat upon the neck. Poor Zephyr! he felt the degradation of the ignominious, heartbreaking service they were subjected to almost as keenly as his master; and not only that, but he had to carry a small arsenal of stores and implements of various kinds: the holsters stuffed with his master's linen and underclothing and the greatcoat rolled above, the stable suit, blouse, and overalls, and the sack containing brushes, currycomb, and other articles of equine toilet behind the saddle, the haversack with rations slung at his side, to say nothing of such trifles as side-lines and picket-pins, the watering bucket and the wooden basin. The cavalryman's tender heart was stirred by a feeling of compassion, as he tightened up the girth and looked to see that everything was secure in its place."
"Il ne fallait pas songer à filer par le pont Royal, que les incendies éclairaient d’une éclatante lumière de plein soleil. À chaque instant, des coups de feu partaient des deux rives. D’ailleurs, on se serait heurté aux Tuileries en flammes, au Louvre barricadé, gardé, comme à une barrière infranchissable.","It was not necessary to think of slipping by the Royal bridge, which the fires lit up with a dazzling light of full sun. Every moment shots were fired from both banks. Besides, we would have come up against the Tuileries in flames, the barricaded and guarded Louvre, like an insurmountable barrier.","It was unthinkable to cross the Pont Royal which owing to the fires was as brightly lit as on a sunny day. The firing on both sides of the river was continuous. And besides, they would have come up against the Tuileries in flames, the Louvre barricaded and guarded, in fact an impassable barrier.","It was useless to think of attempting to pass the Pont Royal, which could not have been more brilliantly illuminated if the noonday sun had been shining on it. At every moment shots were heard coming from either bank of the river. Besides that, the blazing Tuileries lay directly in their path, and the Louvre, guarded and barricaded, would be an insurmountable obstacle."
"Lui, bien qu’il eût également le cœur abreuvé de colère et de dégoût, gardait son bon sens, dans l’affaiblissement de la faim, parmi les cauchemars de cette vie qui touchait le fond de la misère humaine. Et, comme son compagnon s’affolait davantage, voulait se jeter à la Meuse, il dut le retenir, le violenter même, les yeux pleins de larmes, suppliant et grondant. Puis, tout d’un coup :","He, although his heart was also filled with anger and disgust, kept his common sense, in the weakening of hunger, among the nightmares of this life which touched the bottom of human misery. And, as his companion grew more panicky, wanted to throw himself into the Meuse, he had to hold him back, even beat him up, his eyes full of tears, pleading and growling. Then, all of a sudden:","Although he too felt sick with anger and disgust, he hung on to his good sense even though weakened by hunger and in the midst of the nightmares of this existence that was reaching the rock-bottom of human suffering. And as his friend got more hysterical and wanted to dive into the Meuse, he had to hold him back and even rough-handle him, though his eyes were full of tears as he pleaded and scolded. But then suddenly:","He, although his heart, no less than his friend's, was wrung by the horrors that surrounded them on every side, had preserved his mental balance amid the debilitating effects of famine, among the grisly visions of that existence than which none could approach more nearly the depth of human misery. And as his companion's frenzy continued to increase and he talked of casting himself into the Meuse, he was obliged to restrain him, even to the point of using violence, scolding and supplicating, tears standing in his eyes. Then suddenly he said:"
"– Ah ! nous nous cavalons ! reprit Chouteau ! Eh bien ! elle est rigolo, leur marche à l’ennemi, dont ils nous bourrent les oreilles, depuis l’autre matin… Non, vrai, c’est trop crâne ! On arrive, et puis on refout le camp, sans avoir seulement le temps d’avaler sa soupe !","– Ah! we are riding! resumed Chouteau! Well ! it's funny, their march to the enemy, with which they've been stuffing our ears since the other morning... No, really, it's too spunky! We arrive, and then we leave again, without even having time to swallow our soup!","‘Here we go galloping along!’ Chouteau went on. ‘ Well, it’s a rum idea, this march against the foe they’ve been stuffing into our ears since the other morning… No really, it’s too funny by half , we get here and then fuck off again with no time even to swallow our stew!’","but yesterday, gibes and jeers rose on the air in a storm of angry ridicule. “Ah, we are taking the back track,” Chouteau continued. “I wonder if that is the advance against the enemy that they have been dinning in our ears of late! Strikes me as rather queer! No sooner do we get into camp than we turn tail and make off, never even stopping to taste our soup.”"
"– Tu es un brave homme, toi… Merci, mon vieux.","- You are a good man, you ... Thank you, old man.","‘You’re a bloody good chap, you are… thank you, mate.’","“Thou art a good fellow, thou! Thanks, good friend.”"
– Je veux mon mari.,- I want my husband.,‘I want my husband.’,“Give me my husband.”
"Cela ne pouvait durer. Delaherche résolut de retourner encore à la Sous-Préfecture, sentant bien que tout repos lui serait impossible, tant qu’il ne saurait pas. Mais, en bas, devant la rue encombrée, il fut pris d’un désespoir : jamais il n’aurait la force d’aller et de revenir, au milieu des obstacles dont le souvenir seul lui cassait les membres. Et il hésitait, lorsqu’il vit arriver le major Bouroche, soufflant, jurant.","It couldn't last. Delaherche resolved to return again to the Sub-Prefecture, knowing full well that all rest would be impossible for him as long as he did not know. But down below, in front of the crowded street, he was seized with despair: he would never have the strength to go back and forth, amid the obstacles the memory of which alone broke his limbs. And he hesitated when he saw Major Bouroche arrive, puffing and swearing.","It could not go on for ever. Delaherche decided to go back yet again to the Sub-Prefecture, knowing that there would be no rest for him so long as he did not know. But down below, when he saw the jammed street, his heart failed him. He would never have the strength to get there and back with all these obstacles, the very memory of which made him feel exhausted. He was still hesitating when Major Bouroche came in, puffing and blowing and swearing.","This condition of affairs could not last. Delaherche resolved to return once more to the Sous-Prefecture, feeling assured that all rest would be quite out of the question for him so long as his ignorance continued. A feeling of despair seized him, however, when he went downstairs and looked out upon the densely crowded street, where the confusion seemed to be worse than ever; never would he have the strength to fight his way to the Place Turenne and back again through obstacles the mere memory of which caused every bone in his body to ache again. And he was mentally discussing matters, when who should come up but Major Bouroche, panting, perspiring, and swearing."
"Personne ne répondit. Jean se souvenait de l’avoir vu, dans la nuit, s’éloigner du côté de Sedan ; mais un soldat prudent ne doit jamais voir un chef, en dehors du service. Il se taisait, lorsque, en se retournant, il aperçut une ombre, qui revenait le long de la haie.","No one answered. Jean remembered having seen him, in the night, go away towards Sedan; but a prudent soldier should never see a leader, outside the service. He was silent when, turning round, he saw a shadow coming back along the hedge.","There was no answer. Jean recollected having seen him stealing away after dark towards Sedan, but a prudent soldier should never see an officer when off duty. So he was keeping his mouth shut, when turning round he saw a shadowy form coming along the hedge.","No one answered. Jean remembered perfectly having seen him making for Sedan the night before, but to the soldier who knows what is good for himself, his officers are always invisible when they are not on duty. He held his tongue, therefore, until happening to turn his head, he caught sight of a shadowy form flitting along the hedge."
"– Embrasse-moi, mon petit.","""Kiss me, baby.","‘Kiss me, boy.’","“Kiss me, dear boy!”"
"Alors, dans le jour pâle de la pièce, il la vit, d’une ressemblance frappante avec Maurice, de cette extraordinaire ressemblance des jumeaux qui est comme un dédoublement des visages. Pourtant, elle était plus petite, plus mince encore, d’apparence plus frêle, avec sa bouche un peu grande, ses traits menus, sous son admirable chevelure blonde, d’un blond clair d’avoine mûre. Et ce qui la différenciait surtout de lui, c’étaient ses yeux gris, calmes et braves, où revivait toute l’âme héroïque du grand-père, le héros de la Grande Armée. Elle parlait peu, marchait sans bruit, d’une activité si adroite, d’une douceur si riante, qu’on la sentait comme une caresse dans l’air où elle passait.","Then, in the pale light of the room, he saw her, with a striking resemblance to Maurice, with that extraordinary resemblance of twins which is like a splitting of faces. Yet she was smaller, thinner still, more frail in appearance, with her rather large mouth, her slender features, under her admirable blond hair, the light blond of ripe oats. And what especially differentiated her from him were her gray eyes, calm and brave, in which all the heroic soul of the grandfather, the hero of the Grand Army, revived. She spoke little, walked noiselessly, with such adroit activity, such a cheerful gentleness, that one felt her like a caress in the air through which she passed.","Then in the subdued light of the room he saw her, strikingly like Maurice, with that extraordinary likeness of twins which is a sort of duplication of faces. But she was shorter and even slighter, more frail-looking, with a largish mouth, small features and a lovely head of fair hair, the light gold of ripe oats. The main thing that made her different from him was her grey eyes, calm, brave eyes in which there lived on all the heroic soul of their grandfather, the hero of the Grande Armée. She was not a great talker and moved noiselessly, and her movements were so neat, and her gentleness so radiant that as she passed by you felt her like a caress in the air.","Then, in the pale sunlight that filled the room, he saw how like she was to Maurice, with that wonderful resemblance that often makes twins so like each other as to be indistinguishable. She was smaller and slighter than he, however; more fragile in appearance, with a rather large mouth and delicately molded features, surmounted by an opulence of the most beautiful hair imaginable, of the golden yellow of ripened grain. The feature where she least resembled him was her gray eyes, great calm, brave orbs, instinct with the spirit of the grandfather, the hero of the Grand Army. She used few words, was noiseless in her movements, and was so gentle, so cheerful, so helpfully active that where she passed her presence seemed to linger in the air, like a fragrant caress."
– Attendez !,- Wait !,‘Wait a moment.’,“Wait!”
"– Non, non ! laisse-moi, abandonne-moi, je ne t’ai jamais fait que du chagrin. Quand je pense que tu te privais de robes, et que j’étais au collège, moi ! Ah ! oui, une instruction dont j’ai profité joliment !… Et puis, j’ai failli déshonorer notre nom, je ne sais pas où je serais à cette heure, si tu ne t’étais saignée aux quatre membres, pour réparer mes sottises.","- No no ! leave me, abandon me, I have only ever caused you grief. When I think that you deprived yourself of dresses, and that I was in college, me! Ah! yes, an instruction from which I profited handsomely!... And then, I almost dishonored our name, I don't know where I would be at this hour, if you hadn't bled yourself in all four limbs, to make amends for my foolishness.","‘No, no, leave me alone, I’ve never given you anything but trouble. When I think that you went without clothes and I was at college! Oh yes, an education I’ve made fine use of! And then I pretty nearly dishonoured our name, and I don’t know where I’d be now if you hadn’t bled yourself white to pay the price of my idiocy.’","“No, no! leave me, have nothing more to do with me; I have never been anything but a burden to you. When I think that you were making yourself a drudge, a slave, while I was attending college—oh! to what miserable use have I turned that education! And I was near bringing dishonor on our name; I shudder to think where I might be now, had you not beggared yourself to pay for my extravagance and folly.”"
Maurice ne le laissa pas achever.,Maurice did not let him finish.,Maurice cut him short.,Maurice did not permit him to conclude his sentence:
"D’un œil étonné, Silvine regarda autour d’elle, inquiète de se sentir, elle aussi, délassée et heureuse. Pourquoi donc le bonheur si paisible de ce coin perdu, lorsque, à l’entour, il n’y avait que deuil et souffrance ? Elle eut un geste désespéré de hâte.","With astonished eyes, Silvine looked around her, worried that she, too, felt relaxed and happy. Why, then, the peaceful happiness of this lost corner, when all around there was only mourning and suffering? She made a desperate gesture of haste.",Silvine looked round and was astonished and slightly shamefaced to feel that she was refreshed and happy too. Why should there be such peaceful happiness in this lovely spot when all around there was nothing but mourning and grief? She made a gesture indicating urgent haste.,"Silvine cast an astonished look about her, as if wondering how it was that she, too, could feel the influence of the peaceful scene. Why should there be repose and happiness in that hidden nook, when surrounding it on every side were sorrow and affliction? She made a gesture of impatience."
"Honoré, depuis qu’il était là, malgré sa grosse faim, s’arrêtait parfois, tournait la tête, à un bruit qu’il croyait entendre. Si, après tout un combat, il avait manqué à son serment de ne plus jamais remettre les pieds dans cette maison, c’était poussé par l’irrésistible désir de revoir Silvine. Il gardait sous sa chemise, contre sa peau même, la lettre qu’il avait reçue d’elle à Reims, cette lettre si tendre où elle lui disait qu’elle l’aimait toujours, qu’elle n’aimerait jamais que lui, malgré le cruel passé, malgré Goliath et le petit Charlot qu’elle avait eu de cet homme. Et il ne pensait plus qu’à elle, et il s’inquiétait de ne pas l’avoir encore vue, tout en se raidissant, pour ne pas montrer son anxiété à son père. Mais la passion l’emporta, il demanda, d’une voix qu’il s’efforçait de rendre naturelle :","Honoré, ever since he had been there, despite his great hunger, sometimes stopped and turned his head at a noise he thought he heard. If, after a whole fight, he had broken his oath never to set foot in this house again, it was driven by the irresistible desire to see Silvine again. He kept under his shirt, against his very skin, the letter he had received from her in Reims, that tender letter in which she told him that she still loved him, that she would never love anyone but him, despite the cruel past, despite Goliath and the little Charlot she had had from this man. And he thought of nothing but her, and he worried that he hadn't seen her yet, stiffening himself, so as not to show his anxiety to his father. But passion got the better of him, he asked, in a voice he tried to sound natural:","Ever since he had been there Honoré had stopped now and again, in spite of his great hunger, and looked round thinking he heard a noise. The reason why after a great struggle he had broken his oath never to set foot in this house again was that he was urged on by an irresistible desire to see Silvine once more. He had kept under his shirt, in fact next to his body, the letter he had had at Rheims, that affectionate letter in which she told him she still loved him, and that she would never love anyone but him in spite of Goliath and the baby, little Charlot, she had had by this man. And now he could think of nothing but her and was worried because he had not seen her yet, while at the same time holding himself in check so as not to betray his anxiety to his father. But passion won, and he asked in a voice he tried to make sound natural:","Honore, notwithstanding his hunger, had ceased from eating whenever it seemed to him that he heard a noise about the house. If he had struggled long, and finally been false to his oath never to set foot in that house again, the reason was that he could no longer withstand his craving desire to see Silvine. The letter that he had received from her at Rheims lay on his bosom, next his skin, that letter, so tenderly passionate, in which she told him that she loved him still, that she should never love anyone save him, despite the cruel past, despite Goliah and little Charlot, that man's child. He was thinking of naught save her, was wondering why he had not seen her yet, all the time watching himself that he might not let his father see his anxiety. At last his passion became too strong for him, however, and he asked in a tone as natural as he could command:"
"Ce gros homme, si brave, avec ses lunettes, avait fini par l’intéresser, tout en le faisant sourire ; et, comme il entendait venir un obus, il l’avait fraternellement écarté. Le projectile tomba à une dizaine de pas, éclata en les couvrant tous les deux de mitraille. Le bourgeois restait debout, sans une égratignure, tandis que le lieutenant avait eu les deux jambes brisées.","This fat man, so brave, with his glasses, had ended by interesting him, while making him smile; and, as he heard a shell coming, he had fraternally dismissed it. The projectile fell about ten paces away, burst, covering them both with shrapnel. The bourgeois remained standing, without a scratch, while the lieutenant had had both legs broken.","This stout man in his spectacles, so courageous, had ended by rousing his interest, though he had to smile; and as he heard a shell coming he had pushed him aside in a brotherly way. The projectile fell some ten metres away and burst, covering them both with shrapnel. The civilian was still standing, but the lieutenant had both legs broken.","He could not help laughing a little at the queer figure of the big gentleman in spectacles, but his bravery had inspired him with a very genuine feeling of respect, so, when his practiced ear detected a shell coming their way, he had acted the part of a friend and placed the civilian in a safer position. The missile landed some ten paces from where they were and exploded, covering them both with earth and debris. The citizen kept his feet and received not so much as a scratch, while the officer had both legs broken."
"Cependant, le petit jour parut, comme la compagnie Beaudoin traversait Pont-Maugis ; et Maurice se retrouva, les coteaux du Liry à gauche, la Meuse à droite, longeant la route. Mais cette aube grise éclairait d’une infinie tristesse Bazeilles et Balan, noyés au bout des prairies ; tandis qu’un Sedan livide, un Sedan de cauchemar et de deuil, s’évoquait à l’horizon, sur l’immense rideau sombre des forêts. Et, après Wadelincourt, lorsqu’on eut enfin atteint la porte de Torcy, il fallut parlementer, supplier et se fâcher, presque faire le siège de la place, pour obtenir du gouverneur qu’il baissât le pont-levis. Il était cinq heures. Le 7e corps entra dans Sedan, ivre de fatigue, de faim et de froid.","However, daybreak appeared, as the Beaudoin company crossed Pont-Maugis; and Maurice found himself again, the slopes of the Liry on the left, the Meuse on the right, skirting the road. But this gray dawn illuminated Bazeilles and Balan with an infinite sadness, drowned at the end of the meadows; while a livid Sedan, a Sedan of nightmare and mourning, was evoked on the horizon, against the immense dark curtain of the forests. And, after Wadelincourt, when they had finally reached the Porte de Torcy, they had to negotiate, beg and get angry, almost lay siege to the square, to get the governor to lower the drawbridge. It was five o'clock. The 7th corps entered Sedan, drunk with fatigue, hunger and cold.","However, a grey dawn came as the Beaudoin company was going through Pont-Maugis, and Maurice saw where he was, with the hills of Liry on the left and the Meuse along the right of the road. This grey dawn revealed Bazeilles and Balan looking utterly dreary in the mists over the fields, while a livid, nightmarish, tragic Sedan could be made out on the horizon against the immense dark curtain of forest. And after Wadelincourt, when they at last reached the Torcy gate, there had to be a parley, with begging and threats, almost a regular siege, to make the governor lower the drawbridge. It was five o’clock. The 7th corps entered Sedan, knocked out with fatigue, hunger and cold.","Day broke as Maurice's company was passing through Pont Maugis, and then he recognized their locality, the hills of Liry to the left, the Meuse running beside the road on the right. Bazeilles and Balan presented an inexpressibly funereal aspect, looming among the exhalations of the meadows in the chill, wan light of dawn, while against the somber background of her great forests Sedan was profiled in livid outlines, indistinct as the creation of some hideous nightmare. When they had left Wadelincourt behind them and were come at last to the Torcy gate, the governor long refused them admission; he only yielded, after a protracted conference, upon their threat to storm the place. It was five o'clock when at last the 7th corps, weary, cold, and hungry, entered Sedan."
"On lava la table, on jeta une fois encore les seaux d’eau rouge à la volée, au travers de la pelouse. La corbeille de marguerites n’était plus qu’une bouillie sanglante, de la verdure et des fleurs hachées dans du sang. Et le major, à qui on avait apporté le numéro trois, se mit, pour se délasser un peu, à chercher une balle qui, après avoir fracassé le maxillaire inférieur, devait s’être logée sous la langue. Beaucoup de sang coulait et lui engluait les doigts.","The table was washed, the buckets of red water were once again thrown on the fly, across the lawn. The basket of daisies was nothing more than bloody mush, greenery and flowers chopped up in blood. And the major, to whom number three had been brought, began, to relax a little, to look for a bullet which, after having shattered the lower jawbone, must have lodged under his tongue. A lot of blood flowed and stuck his fingers.","They swabbed the table and once more threw the pails of water over the lawn. The bed of daisies was now nothing but a bloodstained mess, greenery and flowers all mangled up in blood. The major, to whom number three had been brought, began by way of a restful change to look for a bullet which after breaking the lower jawbone must have buried itself under the tongue. There was a great deal of blood which made his fingers all sticky.","They cleansed the table; and once more the crimson contents of the buckets were hurled across the grass plot upon the bed of daisies, which was now a sodden, blood-soaked mat of flowers and verdure. And Bouroche, to relieve the tedium until the attendants should bring him “number three,” applied himself to probing for a musket-ball, which, having first broken the patient's lower jaw, had lodged in the root of the tongue. The blood flowed freely and collected on his fingers in glutinous masses."
"Hors de lui, Maurice l’aurait étranglé. Les Prussiens plus forts que les Français ! c’était de cela que saignait son orgueil. Déjà, le paysan ajoutait, calme et têtu :","Irritated, Maurice would have strangled him. The Prussians stronger than the French! that was where his pride was bleeding. Already the peasant was adding, calm and stubborn:","Maurice could have strangled him, for he was beside himself. The Prussians stronger than the French! It made his heart bleed. But the peasant, in his calm and deliberate way, went straight on:","Maurice was beside himself, could have strangled him. The Prussians stronger than the French! The thought made his blood boil. The peasant calmly and stubbornly added:"

We who had everything, here we are without a crust… Ah! you are rude pigs!","‘We’re in a nice old mess!’ he said. ‘We had plenty of everything, and now look at us without a crust to eat… You’re a lot of fucking swine!’","“A pretty pickle we are in!” he continued. “We had food in plenty, and now here we are, without a crumb!

I knew the 106th in the neighborhood, I received a letter from Remilly yesterday, and I wanted to get down... Let's go and drink the white wine.","There he was with a fatherly eye, watching it gleaming in the cool morning air, when he caught sight of Maurice. ‘Oh hallo, I knew the 106th was somewhere about , I had a letter from Remilly yesterday and was coming down … Let’s go and have a white wine.’","“Ah, it's you! I knew that the 106th was somewhere in the vicinity; I got a letter from Remilly yesterday and was intending to start out and hunt you up. Let's go and have a glass of white wine.”"

"En effet, Dubreuil s’était résigné, la veille, à emmener sa femme et ses enfants à Bouillon, dans la certitude du désastre qu’il prévoyait. Pourtant, la maison n’était pas vide, une agitation s’y faisait remarquer de loin, à travers les arbres. Comme la jeune femme se hasardait dans la grande allée, elle recula, devant le cadavre d’un soldat prussien.","Indeed, Dubreuil had resigned himself, the day before, to taking his wife and children to Bouillon, in the certainty of the disaster he foresaw. However, the house was not empty, a commotion was noticeable from afar, through the trees. As the young woman ventured into the main alley, she recoiled before the corpse of a Prussian soldier.","And indeed, foreseeing certain disaster, Dubreuil had decided to take his wife and children to Bouillon the day before. But the house was not empty, and even from a distance and through the trees you could tell that something was going on inside. As she was venturing into the avenue the corpse of a Prussian soldier made her jump back.","The truth was that Dubreuil had decided the day before to take his wife and children to Bouillon, where they would be in safety from the disaster he felt was impending. And yet the house was not unoccupied; even at a distance and through the intervening trees the approaching party were conscious of movements going on within its walls. As the young woman advanced into the avenue she recoiled before the dead body of a Prussian soldier."
"Le 1er mars, les Prussiens devaient entrer dans Paris, et un long cri d’exécration et de colère sortait de tous les cœurs. Maurice n’assistait plus à une réunion publique, sans entendre accuser l’Assemblée, Thiers, les hommes du 4 septembre, de cette honte suprême, qu’ils n’avaient pas voulu épargner à la grande ville héroïque. Lui-même, un soir, s’emporta jusqu’à prendre la parole, pour crier que Paris entier devait aller mourir aux remparts, plutôt que de laisser pénétrer un seul Prussien. Dans cette population, détraquée par des mois d’angoisse et de famine, tombée désormais à une oisiveté pleine de cauchemars, ravagée de soupçons, devant les fantômes qu’elle se créait, l’insurrection poussait ainsi naturellement, s’organisait au plein jour. C’était une de ces crises morales, qu’on a pu observer à la suite de tous les grands sièges, l’excès du patriotisme déçu, qui, après avoir vainement enflammé les âmes, se change en un aveugle besoin de vengeance et de destruction. Le Comité central, que les délégués de la garde nationale avaient élu, venait de protester contre toute tentative de désarmement. Une grande manifestation se produisit, sur la place de la Bastille, des drapeaux rouges, des discours de flamme, un concours immense de foule, le meurtre d’un misérable agent de police, lié sur une planche, jeté dans le canal, achevé à coups de pierre. Et, deux jours plus tard, dans la nuit du 26 février, Maurice, réveillé par le rappel et le tocsin, vit passer sur le boulevard des Batignolles des bandes d’hommes et de femmes qui traînaient des canons, s’attela lui-même à une pièce avec vingt autres, en entendant dire que le peuple était allé prendre ces canons, place Wagram, pour que l’Assemblée ne les livrât pas aux Prussiens. Il y en avait cent soixante-dix, les attelages manquaient, le peuple les tira avec des cordes, les poussa avec les poings, les monta jusqu’au sommet de Montmartre, dans un élan farouche de horde barbare qui sauve ses dieux. Lorsque, le 1er mars, les Prussiens durent se contenter d’occuper pendant un jour le quartier des Champs-Élysées, parqués dans des barrières, ainsi qu’un troupeau de vainqueurs inquiets, Paris lugubre ne bougea pas, les rues désertes, les maisons closes, la ville entière morte, voilée de l’immense crêpe de son deuil.","On March 1, the Prussians were to enter Paris, and a long cry of execration and anger issued from all hearts. Maurice no longer attended a public meeting without hearing the Assembly, Thiers, and the men of the 4th of September accused of this supreme shame, which they had not wished to spare the great heroic city. He himself, one evening, went so far as to speak, to shout that the whole of Paris should go and die on the ramparts, rather than allow a single Prussian to enter. In this population, deranged by months of anguish and famine, now fallen into an idleness full of nightmares, ravaged by suspicions, in the face of the ghosts it was creating for itself, the insurrection thus naturally grew, organized itself in broad daylight. . It was one of those moral crises which have been observed following all the great sieges, the excess of disappointed patriotism which, after having vainly inflamed souls, is changed into a blind need for revenge and destruction. The Central Committee, which the delegates of the National Guard had elected, had just protested against any attempt at disarmament. A great demonstration took place, on the Place de la Bastille, red flags, fiery speeches, an immense concourse of crowds, the murder of a wretched policeman, tied to a plank, thrown into the canal, finished in stone blows. And, two days later, on the night of February 26, Maurice, awakened by the recall and the tocsin, saw passing on the boulevard des Batignolles bands of men and women dragging cannons, harnessed himself to one gun with twenty others, on hearing that the people had gone to take these guns, place Wagram, so that the Assembly would not hand them over to the Prussians. There were a hundred and seventy of them, the teams were missing, the people pulled them with ropes, pushed them with their fists, mounted them to the top of Montmartre, in a fierce dash of a barbarian horde which saves its gods. When, on March 1, the Prussians had to content themselves with occupying the Champs-Élysées district for a day, parked in barriers, like a herd of worried victors, Paris lugubrious did not move, the streets deserted, the houses closed, the entire city dead, veiled in the immense crepe of its mourning.","The Prussians were to make their entry into Paris on 1 March, and a cry of execration and rage rose from every heart. At every public meeting he went to Maurice heard the accusations against the Assembly, Thiers and the men of 4 September for this crowning shame that they had not tried to spare the great, heroic city. One evening he was so worked up that he even spoke himself, shouting that the whole of Paris should go and die on the ramparts rather than let a single Prussian get in. In this manner the insurrection sprang up quite naturally and organized itself in broad daylight among people thrown off balance by months of anguish and famine, fallen into a hag-ridden idleness and haunted by suspicions of their own making. It was one of those crises of morale observed after all great sieges, when unsurpassable patriotism has been cheated and, after inspiring people’s souls to no purpose, changes into a blind lust for vengeance and destruction. The Central Committee, elected by delegates from the National Guard, had protested against any attempt at disarmament. There was a great demonstration on the Place de la Bastille, with red flags, fiery speeches, a huge crowd and the murder of one unfortunate policeman, tied to a plank, thrown into the canal and finished off with stones. Two days later, during the night of 26 February, Maurice was awakened by the call to arms and alarm bells, and watched bands of men and women going along the Boulevard des Batignolles dragging guns; and he went too, and with twenty others harnessed himself to a cannon, when he heard that the people had gone and seized these guns in the Place Wagram to prevent the Assembly from handing them over to the Prussians. There were one hundred and seventy of them, and as some of the proper gear was missing people hauled them with ropes, pushed them with their hands and got them up to the top of Montmartre with the fierce drive of a horde of barbarians rescuing their gods. On 1 March, when the Prussians had to be content with occupying the Champs-Elysées district for one day only, and even then behind fences like a herd of victors unsure of themselves, Paris did not stir from its gloom – all streets deserted and houses shut up, the whole city dead and swathed in the voluminous black crêpe of its mourning.","The 1st of March was the day fixed for the entrance of the Prussians into Paris, and a long-drawn howl of wrath and execration went up from every heart. Maurice never attended a meeting now that he did not hear Thiers, the Assembly, even the men of September 4th themselves, cursed and reviled because they had not spared the great heroic city that crowning degradation. He was himself one night aroused to such a pitch of frenzy that he took the floor and shouted that it was the duty of all Paris to go and die on the ramparts rather than suffer the entrance of a single Prussian. It was quite natural that the spirit of insurrection should show itself thus, should bud and blossom in the full light of day, among that populace that had first been maddened by months of distress and famine and then had found itself reduced to a condition of idleness that afforded it abundant leisure to brood on the suspicions and fancied wrongs that were largely the product of its own disordered imagination. It was one of those moral crises that have been noticed as occurring after every great siege, in which excessive patriotism, thwarted in its aims and aspirations, after having fired men's minds, degenerates into a blind rage for vengeance and destruction. The Central Committee, elected by delegates from the National Guard battalions, had protested against any attempt to disarm their constituents. Then came an immense popular demonstration on the Place de la Bastille, where there were red flags, incendiary speeches and a crowd that overflowed the square, the affair ending with the murder of a poor inoffensive agent of police, who was bound to a plank, thrown into the canal, and then stoned to death. And forty-eight hours later, during the night of the 26th of February, Maurice, awakened by the beating of the long roll and the sound of the tocsin, beheld bands of men and women streaming along the Boulevard des Batignolles and dragging cannon after them. He descended to the street, and laying hold of the rope of a gun along with some twenty others, was told how the people had gone to the Place Wagram and taken the pieces in order that the Assembly might not deliver them to the Prussians. There were seventy of them; teams were wanting, but the strong arms of the mob, tugging at the ropes and pushing at the limbers and axles, finally brought them to the summit of Montmartre with the mad impetuosity of a barbarian horde assuring the safety of its idols. When on March 1 the Prussians took possession of the quarter of the Champs Elysees, which they were to occupy only for one day, keeping themselves strictly within the limits of the barriers, Paris looked on in sullen silence, its streets deserted, its houses closed, the entire city lifeless and shrouded in its dense veil of mourning."
"Puis, de nouveau, le lendemain, Henriette dit à son retour :","Then, again, the next day, Henriette said on her return:","Then once more, the very next day, Henriette said as she came in:","The next day, again, Henriette said upon her return at evening:"
"La gaieté revint à la grande halte, dans un chaume, où les soldats purent s’asseoir sur leurs sacs, pour manger un morceau. Les gros biscuits, carrés, servaient à tremper la soupe ; mais les petits, ronds, croquants et légers, étaient une vraie friandise, qui avait le seul défaut de donner une soif terrible. Invité, Pache à son tour chanta un cantique, que toute l’escouade reprit en chœur. Jean, bon enfant, souriait, laissait faire, tandis que Maurice reprenait confiance, à voir l’entrain de tous, le bel ordre et la belle humeur de cette première journée de marche. Et le reste de l’étape fut franchi du même pas gaillard. Pourtant, les huit derniers kilomètres semblèrent durs. On venait de laisser à droite le village de Prosnes, on avait quitté la grand’route pour couper à travers des terrains incultes, des landes sablonneuses plantées de petits bois de pins ; et la division entière, suivie de l’interminable convoi, tournait au milieu de ces bois, dans ce sable, où l’on enfonçait jusqu’à la cheville. Le désert s’était encore élargi, on ne rencontra qu’un maigre troupeau de moutons, gardé par un grand chien noir.","The gaiety returned to the great halt, in a thatch, where the soldiers could sit down on their bags, to have a bite to eat. The large, square biscuits were used to dip the soup; but the small ones, round, crunchy and light, were a real delicacy, which had the only defect of making you terribly thirsty. Invited, Pache in turn sang a hymn, which the whole squad took up in chorus. Jean, a good child, smiled, let it happen, while Maurice regained his confidence, seeing everyone's enthusiasm, the good order and good humor of this first day's walk. And the rest of the stage was crossed with the same spirited step. However, the last eight kilometers seemed hard. We had just left the village of Prosnes on the right, we had left the main road to cut through uncultivated land, sandy moors planted with small pine woods; and the whole division, followed by the interminable convoy, turned in the middle of these woods, in this sand, in which one sank up to one's ankle. The desert had widened still further, and only a meager herd of sheep was encountered, guarded by a large black dog.","Cheerfulness came back at the main halt in a field of stubble where the soldiers could sit on their packs and have a bite to eat. The big square biscuits were meant for dunking in soup, but the little round ones, crisp and light, were a real treat that had only the one drawback that they made you terribly thirsty. When his turn came, Pache, by request, sang a hymn that the whole squad took up as a chorus. Jean smiled good-naturedly and let them get on with it, and Maurice’s confidence began to return as he saw everybody’s enthusiasm and the orderliness and good humour of this first day’s march. The rest of the stage was covered in the same perky way, but the last eight kilometres seemed tough. They had left the village of Prosnes to their right and had abandoned the main road and cut across fallow land and some sandy heathland dotted with little plantations of pine, and the whole division, followed by its endless supply column, wound its way in and out of these woods, ankle-deep in the sand. The waste land stretched ever further, and there was nothing to be seen in it but a straggling flock of sheep guarded by a big black dog.","Their spirits rose again when they made their midday halt in a field of stubble, where the men could seat themselves on their unslung knapsacks and refresh themselves with a bite. The large square biscuits could only be eaten by crumbling them in the soup, but the little round ones were quite a delicacy, light and appetizing; the only trouble was that they left an intolerable thirst behind them. Pache sang a hymn, being invited thereto, the squad joining in the chorus. Jean smiled good-naturedly without attempting to check them in their amusement, while Maurice, at sight of the universal cheerfulness and the good order with which their first day's march was conducted, felt a revival of confidence. The remainder of the allotted task of the day was performed with the same light-hearted alacrity, although the last five miles tried their endurance. They had abandoned the high road, leaving the village of Prosnes to their right, in order to avail themselves of a short cut across a sandy heath diversified by an occasional thin pine wood, and the entire division, with its interminable train at its heels, turned and twisted in and out among the trees, sinking ankle deep in the yielding sand at every step. It seemed as if the cheerless waste would never end; all that they met was a flock of very lean sheep, guarded by a big black dog."
"Mais Prosper ne répondait pas, devenait inquiet. Lui, ce qui le bouleversait, plus encore que les cadavres des camarades, c’étaient les corps des chevaux, les pauvres chevaux sur le flanc, qu’on rencontrait en grand nombre. Il y en avait vraiment de lamentables, dans des attitudes affreuses, la tête arrachée, les flancs crevés, laissant couler les entrailles. Beaucoup, sur le dos, le ventre énorme, dressaient en l’air leurs quatre jambes raidies, pareilles à des pieux de détresse. La plaine sans bornes en était bossuée. Quelques-uns n’étaient pas morts, après une agonie de deux jours ; et ils levaient au moindre bruit leur tête souffrante, la balançaient à droite, à gauche, la laissaient retomber ; tandis que d’autres, immobiles, jetaient par instants un grand cri, cette plainte du cheval mourant, si particulière, si effroyablement douloureuse, que l’air en tremblait. Et Prosper, le cœur meurtri, songeait à Zéphir, avec l’idée qu’il allait peut-être le revoir.","But Prosper didn't answer, became worried. Him, what upset him, even more than the corpses of his comrades, were the bodies of the horses, the poor horses on the side, which we met in large numbers. There were really lamentable ones, in horrible attitudes, their heads torn off, their sides shattered, letting their entrails leak out. Many, on their backs, with huge bellies, raised their four stiffened legs in the air, like distress stakes. The boundless plain was bumpy with them. Some were not dead after two days' agony; and they raised their ailing heads at the slightest sound, swung it to the right, to the left, let it fall again; while others, motionless, uttered from time to time a great cry, that complaint of the dying horse, so peculiar, so terribly painful, that the air trembled with it. And Prosper, his heart bruised, thought of Zéphir, with the idea that he might perhaps see him again.","Prosper made no answer for he was getting worried himself. What upset him even more than the corpses of his mates were the bodies of the horses, poor horses lying on their sides, which they kept meeting in large numbers. There were some really pitiful ones in dreadful attitudes, decapitated or with bellies split open and entrails coming out. Many were on their backs, with bellies swollen and four legs sticking up in the air like snow posts, dotting the plain as far as you could see. Some of them were still not dead after two days of agony, and at the least sound they raised their suffering heads, turned right and left and dropped them again; others did not move but occasionally uttered a loud scream, the plaint of a dying horse, so unmistakable and so terribly grief-stricken that the very air trembled. Prosper’s heart ached as he thought of Zephir and that he might possibly see him again.","But Prosper made no answer; he also was becoming uneasy. What distressed him even more than the sights of suffering among his fellow-soldiers was the dead horses, the poor brutes that lay outstretched upon their side, that were met with in great numbers. Many of them presented a most pitiful spectacle, in all sorts of harrowing attitudes, with heads torn from the body, with lacerated flanks from which the entrails protruded. Many were resting on their back, with their four feet elevated in the air like signals of distress. The entire extent of the broad plain was dotted with them. There were some that death had not released after their two days' agony; at the faintest sound they would raise their head, turning it eagerly from right to left, then let it fall again upon the ground, while others lay motionless and momentarily gave utterance to that shrill scream which one who has heard it can never forget, the lament of the dying horse, so piercingly mournful that earth and heaven seemed to shudder in unison with it. And Prosper, with a bleeding heart, thought of poor Zephyr, and told himself that perhaps he might see him once again."
"– Quelqu’un les guide, c’est sûr, déclara l’ancien huissier.","""Someone is guiding them, that's for sure,"" said the former bailiff.","‘Somebody is guiding them, for sure,’ declared Ducat.","“They have someone to guide them, for certain,” said the ex-bailiff."
"C’était, au bas du perron, sur le gravier fin de la terrasse, toute une réunion joyeuse. Autour d’un guéridon à tablette de marbre, des fauteuils et un canapé de satin bleu-ciel formaient le cercle, étalant au plein air un salon étrange, que la pluie devait tremper depuis la veille. Deux zouaves, vautrés aux deux bouts du canapé, semblaient éclater de rire. Un petit fantassin, qui occupait un fauteuil, penché en avant, avait l’air de se tenir le ventre. Trois autres s’accoudaient nonchalamment aux bras de leurs sièges, tandis qu’un chasseur avançait la main, comme pour prendre un verre sur le guéridon. Évidemment, ils avaient vidé la cave et faisaient la fête.","There was, at the foot of the steps, on the fine gravel of the terrace, quite a joyful reunion. Around a pedestal table with a marble top, armchairs and a sofa in sky-blue satin formed a circle, spreading out in the open air a strange drawing-room, which must have been drenched in the rain since the day before. Two Zouaves, sprawled at either end of the sofa, seemed to burst out laughing. A small infantryman, who occupied an armchair, leaning forward, seemed to be holding his stomach. Three others were leaning nonchalantly on the arms of their seats, while a porter put out his hand, as if to take a drink from the table. Of course, they had emptied the cellar and were having a party.","At the bottom of the steps, on the gravel terrace, quite a jolly party was going on. Round a marble-topped table was a circle of armchairs and a settee, covered with sky-blue satin, making a strange open-air drawing room that must have been rained on since the day before. At each end of the settee two Zouaves were lolling, apparently bursting with laughter. A little infantryman in an armchair was leaning forward, holding his sides. Three others were nonchalantly supporting their elbows on the arms of their chairs and a cavalryman was putting out his hand to take up a glass from the table. They had obviously raided the cellar and were having a party.","On the fine-crushed gravel of the terrace, at the bottom of the steps that led to the house, was a merry company. Arranged in order around a marble-topped table were a sofa and some easy-chairs in sky-blue satin, forming a sort of fantastic open-air drawing-room, which must have been thoroughly soaked by the rain of the preceding day. Two zouaves, seated in a lounging attitude at either end of the sofa, seemed to be laughing boisterously. A little infantryman, who occupied one of the fauteuils, his head bent forward, was apparently holding his sides to keep them from splitting. Three others were seated in a negligent pose, their elbows resting on the arms of their chairs, while a chasseur had his hand extended as if in the act of taking a glass from the table. They had evidently discovered the location of the cellar, and were enjoying themselves."
– Quoi donc ?,- What ?,‘What is it?’,“What is it?”
"– Mon petit, si l’on doit marcher aujourd’hui, tu ferais bien de voir le major et de te faire coller dans une voiture.","“My dear, if we have to walk today, you had better see the major and get stuck in a car.","‘Look, my boy, if we’ve got to march today you’d do well to see the M.O. and get yourself bunged in a van.’","“If we are to do any marching to-day, my lad, you had better see the surgeon and get him to give you a place in one of the wagons.”"
"Les trompettes sonnaient, la masse s’ébranla, d’abord au trot. Prosper se trouvait au premier rang, mais presque à l’extrémité de l’aile droite. Le grand danger est au centre, où le tir de l’ennemi s’acharne d’instinct. Lorsqu’on fut sur la crête du calvaire et que l’on commença à descendre de l’autre côté, vers la vaste plaine, il aperçut très nettement, à un millier de mètres, les carrés prussiens sur lesquels on les jetait. D’ailleurs, il trottait comme dans un rêve, il avait une légèreté, un flottement d’être endormi, un vide extraordinaire de cervelle, qui le laissait sans une idée. C’était la machine qui allait, sous une impulsion irrésistible. On répétait : « Sentez la botte ! sentez la botte ! » pour serrer les rangs le plus possible et leur donner une résistance de granit. Puis, à mesure que le trot s’accélérait, se changeait en galop enragé, les chasseurs d’Afrique poussaient, à la mode arabe, des cris sauvages, qui affolaient leurs montures. Bientôt, ce fut une course diabolique, un train d’enfer, ce furieux galop, ces hurlements féroces, que le crépitement des balles accompagnait d’un bruit de grêle, en tapant sur tout le métal, les gamelles, les bidons, le cuivre des uniformes et des harnais. Dans cette grêle, passait l’ouragan de vent et de foudre dont le sol tremblait, laissant au soleil une odeur de laine brûlée et de fauves en sueur.","The trumpets sounded, the mass moved, at first at a trot. Prosper was in the front row, but almost at the end of the right wing. The great danger is in the center, where the enemy's fire instinctively persists. When we were on the crest of Calvary and began to descend on the other side, towards the vast plain, he saw very clearly, a thousand meters away, the Prussian squares on which they were thrown. Besides, he trotted as if in a dream, he had a lightness, a hesitation of being asleep, an extraordinary emptiness of brains which left him without an idea. It was the machine that went, under an irresistible impulse. We repeated: “Feel the boot! feel the boot! to close the ranks as much as possible and give them a resistance of granite. Then, as the trot accelerated, changed into a furious gallop, the hunters of Africa uttered, in Arab fashion, savage cries, which drove their mounts mad. Soon, it was a diabolical race, a breakneck pace, this furious gallop, these ferocious howls, which the crackling of bullets accompanied by a noise of hail, hitting all the metal, the bowls, the cans, the copper uniforms and harnesses. In this hail, passed the hurricane of wind and lightning whose ground trembled, leaving in the sun a smell of burnt wool and sweating beasts.","The trumpets sounded and the mass began to move, at first at a trot. Prosper was in the front rank, but almost at the end of the right wing. The greatest danger was in the centre, where the enemy instinctively concentrates his fire. When they had scaled the top of the Calvary hill and were beginning to go down the further side towards the broad plain he had a clear view, some thousand metres ahead, of the Prussian squares against which they were being hurled. For all that, he was riding in a dream, feeling as light and disembodied as a man in his sleep, with an extraordinary vacuum in his brain which left him without a single idea – in fact a machine functioning with irresistible impetus. They kept repeating ‘Close up! Close up!’ so as to close the ranks as tightly as possible and give them a granite-like solidity. Then as the pace quickened and changed into a mad gallop, the Chasseurs d’Afrique, as in the Arab fashion, uttered wild yells that maddened their mounts. This furious gallop soon turned into a diabolical race, hell’s own stampede, with its savage catcalls accompanied by the patter of bullets like hailstones on metal things, messtins, water-bottles, the brass on uniforms and harness. In this hail blew a hurricane of wind and din that made the earth tremble, and into the sunshine rose a smell of scorching wool and the sweat of savage beasts.","The trumpets sounded, the column broke into a trot and was away. Prosper was in the leading squadron, but almost at the extreme right of the right wing, a position of less danger than the center, upon which the enemy always naturally concentrate their hottest fire. When they had topped the summit of the Calvary and began to descend the slope beyond that led downward into the broad plain he had a distinct view, some two-thirds of a mile away, of the Prussian squares that were to be the object of their attack. Beside that vision all the rest was dim and confused before his eyes; he moved onward as one in a dream, with a strange ringing in his ears, a sensation of voidness in his mind that left him incapable of framing an idea. He was a part of the great engine that tore along, controlled by a superior will. The command ran along the line: “Keep touch of knees! Keep touch of knees!” in order to keep the men closed up and give their ranks the resistance and rigidity of a wall of granite, and as their trot became swifter and swifter and finally broke into a mad gallop, the chasseurs d'Afrique gave their wild Arab cry that excited their wiry steeds to the verge of frenzy. Onward they tore, faster and faster still, until their gallop was a race of unchained demons, their shouts the shrieks of souls in mortal agony; onward they plunged amid a storm of bullets that rattled on casque and breastplate, on buckle and scabbard, with a sound like hail; into the bosom of that hailstorm flashed that thunderbolt beneath which the earth shook and trembled, leaving behind it, as it passed, an odor of burned woolen and the exhalations of wild beasts."
"– Oui, je vous ai entendus, pendant que je ne pouvais pas bouger… Alors, prends tout l’argent. Fouille dans la poche de mon pantalon.","– Yes, I heard you, while I couldn’t move… So, take all the money. Search my pants pocket.","‘Yes, I heard you all but I couldn’t move… Maurice, you take all the money. Look in my trouser pocket.’","Take the remainder of the money, then. Put your hand in my trousers' pocket and take it.”"
"– Vous êtes prévenue, répéta Prosper en finissant, et vous saurez, comme ça, ce que vous aurez à faire, quand il viendra ici…","“You have been warned,” Prosper repeated as he finished, “and you will know, that way, what you have to do when he comes here…","‘You are now warned,’ Prosper said again, ‘and so you will know what to do when he comes here…’","“You are forewarned,” said Prosper in conclusion, “and now you'll know what to do when he shows his face here—”"
"Bientôt, en effet, on sut qu’on camperait là, jusqu’à ce que le général Douay se fût procuré des renseignements certains sur la marche de l’ennemi. Depuis la veille, depuis le moment où il avait vu la division Margueritte remonter vers le Chesne, il était dans une anxiété grandissante, sachant qu’il ne se trouvait plus couvert, que plus un homme ne gardait les défilés de l’Argonne, si bien qu’il pouvait être attaqué d’un instant à l’autre. Et il venait d’envoyer le 4e hussards en reconnaissance, jusqu’aux défilés de Grand-Pré et de la Croix-aux-Bois, avec l’ordre de lui rapporter des nouvelles à tout prix.","Soon, in fact, it was known that they would camp there, until General Douay had obtained certain information on the enemy's march. Since the day before, since the moment when he had seen Margueritte's division move up towards the Chesne, he had been in growing anxiety, knowing that he was no longer covered, that no man was guarding the defiles of the Argonne, if though he could be attacked at any moment. And he had just sent the 4th Hussars on reconnaissance, as far as the defiles of Grand-Pré and Croix-aux-Bois, with the order to bring him news at all costs.","It was soon known that they were to camp there until General Douay had had definite information about the movements of the enemy. Since the moment on the previous day when he had seen the Margueritte division going back towards Le Chêne, he had felt increasingly anxious, knowing that he was no longer covered and that there was not a single man guarding the defiles through the Argonne, so that he could be attacked at any moment. He had therefore dispatched the 4th hussars to reconnoitre as far as the defiles of Grand-Pré and La Croix-aux-Bois, with orders to bring back news at all costs.","It soon became known that they were to occupy their present camp until General Douay could obtain definite information as to the movements of the enemy. The general had been harassed by an intense and constantly increasing anxiety since the day before, when he had seen Margueritte's division moving toward Chene, for he knew that his flank was uncovered, that there was not a man to watch the passes of the Argonne, and that he was liable to be attacked at any moment. Therefore he had sent out the 4th hussars to reconnoiter the country as far as the defiles of Grand-Pre and Croix-aux-Bois, with strict orders not to return without intelligence."
"– Tiens ! Laurent, vous en êtes ! s’écria Weiss, surpris de voir parmi eux un grand garçon maigre, qui tenait un fusil, ramassé à côté de quelque cadavre.","- Take ! Laurent, you are! cried Weiss, surprised to see a tall, thin boy among them, holding a gun, picked up beside some corpse.","‘What, you one of them, Laurent!’ exclaimed Weiss, amazed to find among them a lanky fellow with a rifle picked up beside some dead body.","“What, Laurent, you here!” he exclaimed, surprised to recognize among the soldiers a tall, lean young man, who held in his hand a musket, doubtless taken from some corpse."
"– Décidément, il a une sale pierre dans son sac.","– Decidedly, he has a dirty stone in his bag.","At that moment Jean and Maurice distinctly heard Bouroche behind them, muttering after thoroughly examining the Emperor with his practised eye:","“There's no mistake about it, that man is in a bad way.”"
"Par cette soirée glacée de décembre, Silvine et Prosper se trouvaient seuls, avec Charlot, dans la grande cuisine de la ferme, elle cousant, lui en train de se fabriquer un beau fouet. Il était sept heures, on avait dîné à six, sans attendre le père Fouchard, qui devait s’être attardé à Raucourt, où la viande manquait ; et Henriette, dont c’était, cette nuit-là, le tour de veillée, à l’ambulance, venait de partir, en recommandant bien à Silvine de ne pas se coucher, sans aller garnir de charbon le poêle de Jean.","On this icy December evening, Silvine and Prosper were alone with Charlot in the large farmhouse kitchen, she sewing, he making himself a fine whip. It was seven o'clock, they had dined at six, without waiting for Father Fouchard, who must have lingered at Raucourt, where there was a shortage of meat; and Henriette, whose turn it was to watch that night in the ambulance, had just left, advising Silvine not to go to bed without going to fill Jean's stove with coal.","SILVINE and Prosper were alone with Chariot in the big farmhouse kitchen on a cold evening in December, she sewing and he making himself a nice whip. It was seven o’clock, and they had had their dinner at six without waiting for old Fouchard, who must have been delayed at Raucourt, where meat was running short. Henriette, who was then on night duty at the hospital, had just left after telling Silvine not to go to bed without making up Jean’s stove.","The cold was intense on that December evening. Silvine and Prosper, together with little Charlot, were alone in the great kitchen of the farmhouse, she busy with her sewing, he whittling away at a whip that he proposed should be more than usually ornate. It was seven o'clock; they had dined at six, not waiting for Father Fouchard, who they supposed had been detained at Raucourt, where there was a scarcity of meat, and Henriette, whose turn it was to watch that night at the hospital, had just left the house, after cautioning Silvine to be sure to replenish Jean's stove with coal before she went to bed."
"– Gâcher une balle, ah ! non, par exemple ! Vaut mieux en démolir un autre.","– Wasting a ball, ah! no, for example! Better to demolish another one.","‘What, and waste a bullet! Oh no. More use to do in another of them.’","“What, waste a cartridge! Not, much. Better save it for another of 'em.”"
"– Oui, à la jambe, c’est foutu !","– Yes, on the leg, it’s screwed!","‘Yes, in the leg. I’m done for!’","“Yes, and in the leg, worse luck!”"

"Deux jours se passèrent, le jeudi et le vendredi, au milieu des mêmes incendies et des mêmes massacres. Le fracas du canon ne cessait pas ; les batteries de Montmartre, dont l’armée de Versailles s’était emparée, canonnaient sans relâche celles que les fédérés avaient installées à Belleville et au Père-Lachaise ; et ces dernières tiraient au hasard sur Paris : des obus étaient tombés rue Richelieu et à la place Vendôme. Le 25 au soir, toute la rive gauche était entre les mains des troupes. Mais, sur la rive droite, les barricades de la place du Château-d’Eau et de la place de la Bastille tenaient toujours. Il y avait là deux véritables forteresses que défendait un feu terrible, incessant. Au crépuscule, dans la débandade des derniers membres de la Commune, Delescluze avait pris sa canne, et il était venu, d’un pas de promenade, tranquillement, jusqu’à la barricade qui fermait le boulevard Voltaire, pour y tomber foudroyé, en héros. Le lendemain, le 26, dès l’aube, le Château-d’Eau et la Bastille furent emportés, les communards n’occupèrent plus que la Villette, Belleville et Charonne, de moins en moins nombreux, réduits à la poignée de braves qui voulaient mourir. Et, pendant deux jours, ils devaient résister encore et se battre, furieusement.","Two days passed, Thursday and Friday, in the midst of the same fires and the same massacres. The crash of the cannon did not cease; the batteries of Montmartre, which the army of Versailles had seized, cannonaded incessantly those which the Federals had installed at Belleville and at Père-Lachaise; and the latter fired haphazardly on Paris: shells had fallen in the Rue Richelieu and in the Place Vendome. On the evening of the 25th, the whole of the left bank was in the hands of the troops. But, on the right bank, the barricades of the place du Château-d'Eau and the place de la Bastille still held. There were two veritable fortresses there, defended by a terrible, incessant fire. At dusk, in the rout of the last members of the Commune, Delescluze had taken his cane, and he had come, with a walk, calmly, to the barricade which closed the boulevard Voltaire, to fall there struck down, in hero. The next day, the 26th, at dawn, the Château-d'Eau and the Bastille were carried away, the Communards only occupied Villette, Belleville and Charonne, fewer and fewer, reduced to the handful of brave men who wanted to die. And, for two days, they still had to resist and fight, furiously.","Two more days went by, Thursday and Friday, with the same fires and the same massacres. The din of gunfire never stopped, and the batteries up on Montmartre, captured by the Versailles army, were mercilessly pounding the ones the Federals had set up at Belleville and in the Père-Lachaise cemetry. The latter were firing at random on Paris and shells had fallen in the rue de Richelieu and Place Vendôme. By the evening of the 25th the whole of the left bank was in the army’s hands. But on the right bank the barricades at the Place du Château d’Eau and the Place de la Bastille were still holding out, in fact they were real fortresses defended by incessant, withering fire. At dusk, in the final disarray of the last members of the Commune, Delescluze had picked up his walking-stick and coolly strolled along to the barricade blocking the Boulevard Voltaire, where he had fallen, killed instantly in a hero’s death. By dawn on the next day, the 26th, the Château d’Eau and the Bastille had been overcome, and the Communards occupied only La Villette, Belleville and Charonne, and in smaller and smaller numbers, now reduced to the hard core of desperadoes determined to die. For two more days they were to go on resisting and fighting furiously.","Two days more, Thursday and Friday, passed, like their predecessors, amid scenes of slaughter and conflagration. The thunder of the artillery was incessant; the batteries of the army of Versailles on the heights of Montmartre roared against those that the federates had established at Belleville and Pare-Lachaise without a moment's respite, while the latter maintained a desultory fire on Paris. Shells had fallen in the Rue Richelieu and the Place Vendome. At evening on the 25th the entire left bank was in possession of the regular troops, but on the right bank the barricades in the Place Chateau d'Eau and the Place de la Bastille continued to hold out; they were veritable fortresses, from which proceeded an uninterrupted and most destructive fire. At twilight, while the last remaining members of the Commune were stealing off to make provision for their safety, Delescluze took his cane and walked leisurely away to the barricade that was thrown across the Boulevard Voltaire, where he died a hero's death. At daybreak on the following morning, the 26th, the Chateau d'Eau and Bastille positions were carried, and the Communists, now reduced to a handful of brave men who were resolved to sell their lives dearly, had only la Villette, Belleville, and Charonne left to them, And for two more days they remained and fought there with the fury of despair."
"Mais, dans Sedan, leur marche fut singulièrement entravée. Dès qu’ils eurent franchi les fortifications, une puanteur les enveloppa, un lit de fumier leur monta aux genoux. C’était la ville immonde, un cloaque où, depuis trois jours, s’entassaient les déjections et les excréments de cent mille hommes. Toutes sortes de détritus avaient épaissi cette litière humaine, de la paille, du foin, que faisait fermenter le crottin des bêtes. Et, surtout, les carcasses des chevaux, abattus et dépecés en pleins carrefours, empoisonnaient l’air. Les entrailles se pourrissaient au soleil, les têtes, les os traînaient sur le pavé, grouillants de mouches. Certainement, la peste allait souffler, si l’on ne se hâtait pas de balayer à l’égout cette couche d’effroyable ordure, qui, rue du Ménil, rue Maqua, même sur la place Turenne, atteignait jusqu’à vingt centimètres. Des affiches blanches, du reste, posées par les autorités prussiennes, réquisitionnaient les habitants pour le lendemain, ordonnant à tous, quels qu’ils fussent, ouvriers, marchands, bourgeois, magistrats, de se mettre à la besogne, armés de balais et de pelles, sous la menace des peines les plus sévères, si la ville n’était pas propre le soir ; et, déjà, l’on pouvait voir, devant sa porte, le président du tribunal qui raclait le pavé, jetant les immondices dans une brouette, avec une pelle à feu.","But, in Sedan, their progress was singularly impeded. As soon as they had crossed the fortifications, a stench enveloped them, a bed of manure rose to their knees. It was the filthy city, a cesspool where, for three days, the excrement and excrement of a hundred thousand men had been heaped up. All sorts of detritus had thickened this human litter, straw, hay, fermented by animal dung. And, above all, the carcasses of horses, slaughtered and butchered in the middle of crossroads, poisoned the air. Entrails rotted in the sun, heads and bones lay on the pavement, swarming with flies. Certainly, the plague was going to blow, if one did not hasten to sweep in the sewer this appalling layer of filth, which, rue du Ménil, rue Maqua, even on the place Turenne, reached up to twenty centimeters. White posters, moreover, put up by the Prussian authorities, requisitioned the inhabitants for the next day, ordering everyone, whoever they were, workers, merchants, bourgeois, magistrates, to set to work, armed with brooms and shovels, under threat of the most severe penalties, if the town was not clean in the evening; and, already, one could see, in front of his door, the president of the court scraping the pavement, throwing the refuse into a wheelbarrow, with a fire shovel.","However, in Sedan itself they were very badly held up. As soon as they had passed through the fortifications they were overcome by a foul stench, and a bed of filth came up to their knees. The town was disgusting, an open sewer in which the defecation and urine of a hundred thousand men had been piling up for three days. All sorts of other muck had thickened this human dunghill – straw and hay itself rotting with the droppings of animals. Even worse, the carcasses of horses which had been slaughtered and cut up in the open street poisoned the air. Offal was decaying in the sun, heads and bones were lying in the street, alive with flies. Plague would certainly break out unless this layer of horrible filth was quickly swept down into the drains, for in the rue du Ménil and rue Maqua and even the Place Turenne it was as much as twenty centimetres deep. Moreover white posters had been put up by the Prussian authorities mustering all inhabitants for the next day and ordering all persons, whoever they were, workmen, shopkeepers, professional people, magistrates, to set to work with brooms and shovels under the threat of the severest penalties if the town was not clean by evening. Already the chief magistrate could be seen in front of his home raking over the roadway and shovelling the muck into a wheelbarrow.","When they were within Sedan, however, they found their progress retarded owing to a singular cause. As soon as they had passed the fortifications their nostrils were saluted by such a stench, they were obliged to wade through such a mass of abominable filth, reaching almost to their knees, as fairly turned their stomachs. The city, where for three days a hundred thousand men had lived without the slightest provision being made for decency or cleanliness, had become a cesspool, a foul sewer, and this devil's broth was thickened by all sorts of solid matter, rotting hay and straw, stable litter, and the excreta of animals. The carcasses of the horses, too, that were knocked on the head, skinned, and cut up in the public squares, in full view of everyone, had their full share in contaminating the atmosphere; the entrails lay decaying in the hot sunshine, the bones and heads were left lying on the pavement, where they attracted swarms of flies. Pestilence would surely break out in the city unless they made haste to rid themselves of all that carrion, of that stratum of impurity, which, in the Rue de Minil, the Rue Maqua, and even on the Place Turenne, reached a depth of twelve inches. The Prussian authorities had taken the matter up, and their placards were to be seen posted about the city, requisitioning the inhabitants, irrespective of rank, laborers, merchants, bourgeois, magistrates, for the morrow; they were ordered to assemble, armed with brooms and shovels, and apply themselves to the task, and were warned that they would be subjected to heavy penalties if the city was not clean by night. The President of the Tribunal had taken time by the forelock, and might even then be seen scraping away at the pavement before his door and loading the results of his labors upon a wheelbarrow with a fire-shovel."

Delaherche, qui avait déjà repris son aplomb de riche industriel, d’une bonhomie de patron aimant la popularité, sévère seulement à l’insuccès, en revint sur Napoléon III, dont la figure hantait, depuis l’avant-veille, sa curiosité de badaud.

"Tous burent, réconciliés, réchauffés. Ce fut très gentil, cette goutte, dans le petit froid du matin, au moment de marcher à l’ennemi. Et Maurice la sentit qui descendait dans ses veines, en lui rendant la chaleur et la demi-ivresse de l’illusion. Pourquoi ne battrait-on pas les Prussiens ? Est-ce que les batailles ne réservaient pas leurs surprises, des revirements inattendus dont l’Histoire gardait l’étonnement ? Ce diable d’homme ajoutait que Bazaine était en marche, qu’on l’attendait avant le soir : oh ! un renseignement sûr, qu’il tenait de l’aide de camp d’un général ; et, bien qu’il montrât la Belgique, pour indiquer la route par laquelle arrivait Bazaine, Maurice s’abandonna à une de ces crises d’espoir, sans lesquelles il ne pouvait vivre. Peut-être enfin était-ce la revanche.","All drank, reconciled, warmed. It was very nice, this drop, in the little cold of the morning, when marching against the enemy. And Maurice felt it running through his veins, restoring to him the warmth and half-intoxication of illusion. Why shouldn't we beat the Prussians? Did not the battles reserve their surprises, unexpected reversals of which History kept the astonishment? This devil of a man added that Bazaine was on his way, that he was expected before evening: oh! reliable information, which he had received from a general's aide-de-camp; and, although he pointed to Belgium, to indicate the route by which Bazaine arrived, Maurice gave himself up to one of those fits of hope without which he could not live. Maybe it was finally revenge.","They all drank, warmed up and friends again. This drink was a real treat in the chilly morning just before marching against the enemy. Maurice felt it running down into his veins, giving him the warmth and semi-tipsiness of illusion. Why shouldn’t they beat the Prussians? Didn’t battles have their surprises in store, the sudden changes of fortune that history looked at in wonderment? This devil of a man went on to say that Bazaine was on the march and was expected before the evening, and although it was actually Belgium he pointed to, when indicating the route Bazaine was taking, Maurice indulged in one of those upsurges of hope without which he could not live. Perhaps this was the moment of revenge after all.","They all drank, and their hearts were warmed and peace reigned once more. The “nip” had much of comfort in it, in the chill morning, just as they were going into action, and Maurice felt it tingling in his veins, giving him cheer and a sort of what is known colloquially as “Dutch courage.” Why should they not whip the Prussians? Have not battles their surprises? has not history embalmed many an instance of the fickleness of fortune? That mighty man of war, the lieutenant, added that Bazaine was on the way to join them, would be with them before the day was over: oh, the information was positive; he had it from an aid to one of the generals; and although, in speaking of the route the marshal was to come by, he pointed to the frontier of Belgium, Maurice yielded to one of those spasmodic attacks of hopefulness of his, without which life to him would not have been worth living. Might it not be that the day of reckoning was at hand?"
"– Il se bat, pourquoi donc ?","- He fights, why?",‘Fighting – but why?’,"“He is fighting, you say?—and why?”"
"Delaherche, rassuré, songea qu’il mourait de faim et résolut de retourner chez lui. Mais, dès qu’il se retrouva dehors, il demeura hésitant, devant l’encombrement effroyable qui avait achevé de se produire. Les rues, les places étaient gorgées, bondées, emplies à un tel point d’hommes, de chevaux, de canons, que cette masse compacte semblait y avoir été entrée de force, à coups de quelque pilon gigantesque. Pendant que, sur les remparts, bivouaquaient les régiments qui s’étaient repliés en bon ordre, les débris épars de tous les corps, les fuyards de toutes les armes, une tourbe grouillante avait submergé la ville, un entassement, un flot épaissi, immobilisé, où l’on ne pouvait plus remuer ni bras ni jambes. Les roues des canons, des caissons, des voitures innombrables, s’enchevêtraient. Les chevaux fouaillés, poussés dans tous les sens, n’avaient plus la place pour avancer ou reculer. Et les hommes, sourds aux menaces, envahissaient les maisons, dévoraient ce qu’ils trouvaient, se couchaient où ils pouvaient, dans les chambres, dans les caves. Beaucoup étaient tombés sous les portes, barrant les vestibules. D’autres, sans avoir la force d’aller plus loin, gisaient sur les trottoirs, y dormaient d’un sommeil de mort, ne se levant même pas sous les pieds qui leur meurtrissaient un membre, aimant mieux se faire écraser que de se donner la peine de changer de place.","Delaherche, reassured, thought he was starving and resolved to return home. But, as soon as he found himself outside, he remained hesitant, faced with the appalling crowding that had finally occurred. The streets, the squares were gorged, crowded, filled to such an extent with men, horses, cannons, that this compact mass seemed to have been forced into them by the blows of some gigantic pestle. While on the ramparts bivouacked the regiments which had fallen back in good order, the scattered remains of all the corps, the fugitives of all the arms, a teeming peat had submerged the city, a pile-up, a thickened flood, , where one could no longer move either arms or legs. The wheels of guns, caissons, innumerable carriages, became entangled. The whipped horses, pushed in all directions, had no room to move forward or backward. And the men, deaf to the threats, invaded the houses, devoured what they found, slept where they could, in the bedrooms, in the cellars. Many had fallen under the doors, blocking the vestibules. Others, without having the strength to go any further, lay on the sidewalks, slept the deathly sleep there, not even getting up under the feet which bruised their limbs, preferring to be crushed to bother to change places.","Delaherche, feeling reassured, realized that he was dying of hunger and decided to go home. But as soon as he was outside he was pulled up short by the terrible confusion that had developed. The streets and open spaces were jammed and bursting, so full of men, horses and equipment that the compact mass looked as though it must have been forced in by some gigantic ram. While the regiments that had retired in good order were camping on the ramparts, the scattered remnants of every corps, the fugitives from all arms, a milling throng, had submerged the town and piled up like a tidal wave that had congealed and frozen solid, in which you could not move arms or legs. The wheels of guns, waggons and countless vehicles had fouled each other. Horses, whipped and shoved in all directions, had no room to go forwards or backwards. And the men, taking no notice of threats, were breaking into houses, devouring whatever they found and lying down wherever they could, in rooms or in cellars. Many had fallen asleep in doorways and were blocking entries. Some, too weak to go any further, were lying on the pavement dead asleep, not even stirring under feet that bruised their limbs, preferring to be trodden on rather than to have to make the effort to go somewhere else.","Delaherche, somewhat relieved in mind by what he had heard and seen, remembered that it was a long time since he had tasted food and resolved to turn his steps homeward, but the terrific crowd that had collected since he first came made him pause in dismay. It is no exaggeration to say that the streets and squares were so congested, so thronged, so densely packed with horses, men, and guns, that one would have declared the closely compacted mass could only have been squeezed and wedged in there thus by the effort of some gigantic mechanism. While the ramparts were occupied by the bivouacs of such regiments as had fallen back in good order, the city had been invaded and submerged by an angry, surging, desperate flood, the broken remnants of the various corps, stragglers and fugitives from all arms of the service, and the dammed-up tide made it impossible for one to stir foot or hand. The wheels of the guns, of the caissons, and the innumerable vehicles of every description, had interlocked and were tangled in confusion worse confounded, while the poor horses, flogged unmercifully by their drivers and pulled, now in this direction, now in that, could only dance in their bewilderment, unable to move a step either forward or back. And the men, deaf to reproaches and threats alike, forced their way into the houses, devoured whatever they could lay hands on, flung themselves down to sleep wherever they could find a vacant space , it might be in the best bedroom or in the cellar. Many of them had fallen in doorways, where they blocked the vestibule; others, without strength to go farther, lay extended on the sidewalks and slept the sleep of death, not even rising when some by-passer trod on them and bruised an arm or leg, preferring the risk of death to the fatigue of changing their location."
"Elle devint toute blême, les mains tremblantes, ne trouvant à bégayer qu’une plainte sourde.","She went very pale, her hands trembling, finding nothing to stutter except a dull complaint.","She turned deathly pale, her hands shook, and the only sound she could utter was a soft moan.",Her face suddenly became white as death; all she was capable of uttering was a stifled moan:
"– L’empereur a fait appeler le maréchal, ajouta le pharmacien, et ils sont restés enfermés ensemble pendant près d’une heure. Naturellement, je ne sais pas ce qu’ils ont pu se dire, mais ce que tous les officiers m’ont répété, c’est qu’on ne bat plus en retraite et que la marche sur la Meuse est reprise… Nous venons de réquisitionner tous les fours de la ville pour le 1er corps, qui remplacera ici, demain matin, le 12e, dont l’artillerie, comme vous le voyez, part en ce moment pour la Besace… Cette fois, c’est bien fini, vous voilà en route pour la bataille !","“The Emperor sent for the Marshal,” added the pharmacist, “and they remained locked up together for nearly an hour. Naturally, I don't know what they might have said to each other, but what all the officers told me was that we are no longer beating a retreat and that the march on the Meuse has resumed... We have just requisition all the ovens in the city for the 1st corps, which will replace here, tomorrow morning, the 12th, whose artillery, as you can see, is leaving at this moment for La Besace... This time, it's all over, you Here we go for battle!","‘The Emperor sent for the marshal,’ went on the chemist, ‘and they were shut up together for nearly an hour. Of course, I don’t know what they can have said, but what all the officers have repeated is that the retreat is off and the march to the Meuse is on again… We have requisitioned all the bakehouses in the town for the 1st corps which will replace the 12th here in the morning. The 12th’s artillery, as you see, is now leaving for La Besace… This really is the end, and you are off to battle!’","“The Emperor sent for the marshal,” added the apothecary, “and they were closeted together for near an hour ; of course I am not in position to say what passed between them, but I am told by all the officers that there is to be no more retreating, and the advance to the Meuse is to be resumed at once. We have been requisitioning all the ovens in the city for the 1st corps, which will come up to-morrow morning and take the place of the 12th, whose artillery you see at this moment starting for la Besace. The matter is decided for good this time; you will smell powder before you are much older.”"

"Henriette hochait la tête, se rangeait à son avis, pour ne pas l’assombrir davantage. Elle se perdait au milieu de ces vastes mouvements de troupes, mais elle sentait le malheur inévitable. Sa voix restait claire, elle aurait lu ainsi pendant des heures, simplement heureuse de l’amuser. Parfois, pourtant, à un récit de massacre, elle bégayait, les yeux emplis d’un brusque flot de larmes. Sans doute, elle venait de penser à son mari foudroyé là-bas, poussé du pied par l’officier bavarois, contre le mur.","Henriette shook her head, agreed to his opinion, so as not to darken him further. She was lost in the midst of these vast troop movements, but she felt the inevitable misfortune. Her voice remained clear, she would have read like this for hours, simply happy to amuse him. Sometimes, however, at a story of massacre, she stammered, her eyes filling with a sudden flood of tears. No doubt she had just been thinking of her husband struck down over there, pushed with his foot by the Bavarian officer against the wall.","Henriette nodded and agreed with his opinion so as not to depress him still more. She was all at sea in these vast troop movements, but she had a presentiment that disaster was inevitable. Her voice stayed clear and bright and she could have gone on reading for hours just for the happiness of interesting him. But sometimes in a report about slaughter her voice would falter and her eyes suddenly fill with tears. No doubt it reminded her of her husband shot out there and kicked against the wall by the Bavarian officer.","Henriette nodded her head and appeared to agree with him, in order to keep him in a cheerful frame of mind. She could not follow those complicated operations of the armies, but had a presentiment of coming, inevitable evil. Her voice was fresh and clear; she could have gone on reading thus for hours; only too glad to have it in her power to relieve the tedium of his long day, though at times, when she came to some narrative of slaughter, her eyes would fill with tears that made the words upon the printed page a blur. She was doubtless thinking of her husband's fate, how he had been shot down at the foot of the wall and his body desecrated by the touch of the Bavarian officer's boot."
"Pendant tout le mois d’avril, Maurice fit le coup de feu, du côté de Neuilly. Le printemps hâtif fleurissait les lilas, on se battait au milieu de la verdure tendre des jardins ; et des gardes nationaux rentraient le soir avec des bouquets au bout de leur fusil. Maintenant, les troupes réunies à Versailles étaient si nombreuses, qu’on avait pu en former deux armées, l’une de première ligne, sous les ordres du maréchal de Mac-Mahon, l’autre de réserve, commandée par le général Vinoy. Quant à la Commune, elle avait pour elle près de cent mille gardes nationaux mobilisés et presque autant de sédentaires ; mais cinquante mille au plus se battaient réellement. Et, chaque jour, le plan d’attaque des Versaillais s’indiquait davantage : après Neuilly, ils avaient occupé le château de Bécon, puis Asnières, simplement pour resserrer la ligne de l’investissement ; car ils comptaient entrer par le Point-du-Jour, dès qu’ils pourraient y forcer le rempart, sous les feux convergents du Mont-Valérien et du fort d’Issy. Le Mont-Valérien était à eux, tous leurs efforts tendaient à s’emparer du fort d’Issy, qu’ils attaquaient, en utilisant les anciens travaux des Prussiens. Depuis le milieu d’avril, la fusillade, la canonnade ne cessaient plus. À Levallois, à Neuilly, c’était un combat incessant, un feu de tirailleurs de toutes les minutes, le jour et la nuit. De grosses pièces, montées sur des wagons blindés, évoluaient le long du chemin de fer de ceinture, tiraient sur Asnières, par-dessus Levallois. Mais à Vanves, à Issy surtout, le bombardement faisait rage, toutes les vitres de Paris en tremblaient, comme aux journées les plus rudes du siège. Et, le 9 mai, lorsque, après une première alerte, le fort d’Issy tomba définitivement aux mains de l’armée de Versailles, ce fut pour la Commune la défaite certaine, un coup de panique qui la jeta aux pires résolutions.","Throughout the month of April, Maurice made the shot, near Neuilly. The early spring was blooming the lilacs, we were fighting in the middle of the tender greenery of the gardens; and National Guards returned in the evening with bouquets at the end of their guns. Now the troops assembled at Versailles were so numerous that it had been possible to form two armies, one of the first line, under the orders of Marshal de Mac-Mahon, the other in reserve, commanded by General Vinoy. As for the Commune, it had on its side nearly a hundred thousand national guards mobilized and almost as many sedentary; but fifty thousand at most were really fighting. And, each day, the plan of attack of the Versaillese became clearer: after Neuilly, they had occupied the castle of Bécon, then Asnières, simply to tighten the line of the investment; for they intended to enter by Point-du-Jour, as soon as they could force the rampart there, under the converging fires of Mont-Valérien and the fort of Issy. Mont-Valérien was theirs, all their efforts were aimed at seizing the fort of Issy, which they were attacking, using the old works of the Prussians. Since the middle of April, the fusillade, the cannonade had not ceased. At Levallois, at Neuilly, there was an incessant fight, a fire of skirmishers every minute, day and night. Large guns, mounted on armored wagons, moved along the belt railway, firing at Asnieres, over Levallois. But at Vanves, especially at Issy, the bombardment was raging, all the windows of Paris shook, as on the harshest days of the siege. And, on May 9, when, after a first alert, the fort of Issy fell definitively into the hands of the army of Versailles, it was for the Commune the certain defeat, a stroke of panic which threw it to the worst resolutions.","All through the month of April Maurice was fighting near Neuilly. An early spring brought out the lilacs, and the fighting went on amid the fresh green of the gardens, and National Guards came home at night with bunches of flowers on the ends of their rifles. By now the troops assembled at Versailles were so numerous that they had been formed into two armies, a front line one under the orders of Marshal MacMahon, and a reserve army, commanded by General Vinoy. The Commune on its side had nearly a hundred thousand active National Guards and almost as many militiamen, but only fifty thousand at the most were really fighters. And each day the Versailles tactics became clearer: after Neuilly they had occupied the château of Bécon, then Asnières, simply to close up their line of investment, for they planned to enter by the Point-du-Jour as soon as they could force the rampart by means of convergent fire from the forts of the Mont-Valérien and Issy. The Mont-Valérien was in their hands, and their whole effort was directed at capturing the fort of Issy, which they attacked by utilizing the breastworks made by the Prussians. From mid April the rifle-fire and bombardment were continuous. At Levallois and Neuilly there was non-stop fighting, with snipers firing every minute, day and night. Heavy guns on armoured trucks moved along the Ceinture railway and fired over Levallois at Asnières. But the bombardment was fiercest at Vanves and Issy, and every window in Paris shook, as they had during the worst days of the siege. On 9 May when, after an earlier alarm, the fort of Issy definitely fell into the hands of the Versailles army the defeat of the Commune was inevitable and a panic set in which prompted the wildest excesses.","During the entire month of April Maurice was on duty in the neighborhood of Neuilly. The gentle warmth of the early spring had brought out the blossoms on the lilacs, and the fighting was conducted among the bright verdure of the gardens; the National Guards came into the city at night with bouquets of flowers stuck in their muskets. The troops collected at Versailles were now so numerous as to warrant their formation in two armies, a first line under the orders of Marshal MacMahon and a reserve commanded by General Vinoy. The Commune had nearly a hundred thousand National Guards mobilized and as many more on the rosters who could be called out at short notice, but fifty thousand were as many as they ever brought into the field at one time. Day by day the plan of attack adopted by the Versaillese became more manifest: after occupying Neuilly they had taken possession of the Chateau of Becon and soon after of Asnieres, but these movements were simply to make the investment more complete, for their intention was to enter the city by the Point-du-Jour soon as the converging fire from Mont-Valerien and Fort d'Issy should enable them to carry the rampart there. Mont-Valerien was theirs already, and they were straining every nerve to capture Issy, utilizing the works abandoned by the Germans for the purpose. Since the middle of April the fire of musketry and artillery had been incessant; at Levallois and Neuilly the fighting never ceased, the skirmishers blazing away uninterruptedly, by night as well as by day. Heavy guns, mounted on armored cars, moved to and fro on the Belt Railway, shelling Asnieres over the roofs of Levallois. It was at Vanves and Issy, however, that the cannonade was fiercest; it shook the windows of Paris as the siege had done when it was at its height. And when finally, on the 9th of May, Fort d'Issy was obliged to succumb and fell into the hands of the Versailles army the defeat of the Commune was assured, and in their frenzy of panic the leaders resorted to most detestable measures."
"– Ah ! zut ! cria Chouteau, c’est le moment !","– Ah! Damn ! cried Chouteau, it's time!",‘Oh blast it all!’ cried Chouteau. ‘Now’s the time!’,", frightened looks about them to see they were not observed. “Ah, zut!” exclaimed Chouteau, “the time is come!”"
"Et elle laissa un instant seul Prosper, qui, pour ne pas la gêner en la regardant, avait affecté de se remettre à sculpter soigneusement le manche de son fouet.","And she left Prosper alone for a moment, who, so as not to embarrass her by looking at her, had affected to go back to carefully sculpting the handle of his whip.","So as not to embarrass her by looking at her, Prosper had made a point of carefully going on with carving his whip-handle. She left him alone for a minute.","And she went from the room, leaving Prosper alone. The good fellow, not to add to her embarrassment, had averted his eyes from her face and was apparently devoting his entire attention to his carving."
"– Ah ! ce cochon de soleil, le voilà donc qui se couche !","– Ah! this pig of the sun, here it is, then, which goes to bed!","For the last time, Jean looked up westwards where the sky was filling with a great pink light, and at last he sighed with immense relief: ‘Oh, that bloody sun, at last it’s going down!’","For the third time Jean raised his eyes toward the western sky, that was all aflame with a bright, rosy light; and he heaved a sigh of unspeakable relief. “Ah, that pig of a sun! at last he is going to bed!”"
"D’un geste menaçant, il avait montré l’horizon envahi de ténèbres, tout cet orient violâtre, qui pour lui était la Prusse. Il y eut un silence, on entendit de nouveau la retraite, mais très lointaine, qui se perdait à l’autre bout du camp, d’une douceur mourante au milieu des choses devenues indécises.","With a menacing gesture he had shown the horizon invaded by darkness, all that violet east, which for him was Prussia. There was a silence, we heard the retreat again, but very distant, which was lost at the other end of the camp, with a dying sweetness in the midst of things that had become undecided.","He had made a menacing gesture towards the darkening horizon – all that purplish Orient which for him was Prussia. There was a silence and then retreat was heard once more, but far away, fading out towards the end of the camp with a dying softness in keeping with the deepening haze.","He shook his fist with an air of menace at the dusky horizon, at the wide empurpled stretch of eastern sky that stood for Prussia in his eyes. No one spoke; they heard the strains of retreat again, but very distant now, away at the extreme end of the camp, blended and lost among the hum of other indistinguishable sounds."
"– Ah ! les voici, reprit Maurice qui baissa instinctivement la voix, sans nommer les Prussiens. Nous sommes coupés, c’est fichu !","– Ah! here they are,” resumed Maurice, who instinctively lowered his voice, without naming the Prussians. We're cut off, it's over!","‘Ah, here they come,’ said Maurice, instinctively lowering his voice and not mentioning the Prussians by name. ‘We’re cut off, it’s all up!’","“Ah, they are there,” continued Maurice, instinctively lowering his voice. “Too late, too late; they have intercepted us!”"
"– Mon petit, répétait Jean à Maurice, attention ! c’est le coup de chien… Ne montre pas le bout de ton nez, car pour sûr on te le démolirait… Et ramasse bien tes os sous ta peau, si tu ne veux pas en laisser en route. Ceux qui en reviendront, cette fois, seront des bons.","“My little one,” repeated Jean to Maurice, “watch out! it's the dog kick... Don't show the tip of your nose, because for sure it will be demolished for you... And pick up your bones well under your skin, if you don't want to leave any on the way. Those who come back this time will be good.","‘Mind how you go, young fellow-me-lad!’ Jean said more than once to Maurice. ‘This is the crunch… Don’t show the tip of your nose or it’ll get blown off! Keep your bones well inside unless you want to leave a few on the road. The ones who get back after this lot will be pretty good.’","Jean said to Maurice; “we're in for it. Don't let 'em see so much as the end of your nose, for if you do they will surely snip it off, and keep a sharp lookout for your legs and arms unless you have more than you care to keep. Those who come out of this with a whole skin will be lucky.”"
"– Dites donc, demanda Maurice, dont la curiosité se réveillait, c’est peut-être bien des nouvelles de Bazaine que vous apportez ?","“I say,” asked Maurice, whose curiosity was awakened, “perhaps it is indeed news from Bazaine that you bring?","‘I say,’ asked Maurice, whose curiosity was aroused, ‘perhaps it’s news of Bazaine you’ve brought?’","“Tell me,” said Maurice, his curiosity again getting the better of him, “isn't it possible that the news you are bringing may be from Bazaine?”"
"– C’est vous, Beaudouin ?","""Is that you, Beaudouin?""","‘That you, Beaudoin?’","“Is that you, Beaudoin?”"
"– Oui, oui ! sois tranquille !",- Yes yes ! be quiet !,"‘Yes, yes, don’t you worry.’","“Yes, yes; never fear!”"
"– Ma pauvre enfant, vous voyez bien qu’il vous est impossible de passer… Ce n’est pas l’affaire d’une femme d’aller à Bazeilles en ce moment… Vous le retrouverez plus tard, votre mari. Voyons, soyez raisonnable !","“My poor child, you see very well that it is impossible for you to pass… It is not a woman's business to go to Bazeilles at this moment… You will find your husband later. Come on, be reasonable!","‘Poor child, you can see it’s impossible for you to get through… It’s no woman’s job to go to Bazeilles just now… You’ll find that husband of yours later. Now come along, do be sensible!’","“My poor child, you see it is impossible to get through. Bazeilles is no place for you. You will find your husband by and by. Come, listen to reason!”"
"– Votre oncle, le colonel, nous envoie le major Bouroche, avec un billet écrit au crayon, pour nous demander si nous ne pourrions pas laisser installer ici une ambulance… Il sait que nous avons de la place, dans la fabrique, et j’ai déjà mis la cour et le séchoir à la disposition de ces messieurs… Seulement, vous devriez descendre.","– Your uncle, the colonel, sends Major Bouroche to us, with a note written in pencil, to ask us if we could not allow an ambulance to be set up here… He knows that we have room in the factory, and I I have already put the yard and the dryer at the disposal of these gentlemen… Only you should come down.","‘Your uncle the colonel has sent Major Bouroche with a pencilled note to ask whether we could fit up a casualty station here. He knows we’ve got room in the mill, and I’ve already put the yard and drying-shed at their disposal… Only you ought to go down…’","“Your uncle, the colonel, has sent the regimental surgeon with a note in pencil, to ask if we will allow them to establish a hospital here. He knows that we have abundance of space in the factory, and I have already authorized the gentlemen to make use of the courtyard and the big drying-room. But you should go down in person—”"
"– Tiens ! là, celle qui s’établit à gauche, c’est la batterie d’Honoré. Je reconnais les hommes.","- Take ! there, that which is established on the left, it is the battery of Honoré. I recognize the men.","‘Look over there, the one taking the left position is Honoré’s battery. I recognize the men.’","“Look! over there on the left, that is Honore's battery. I can recognize the men.”"
"Dès lors, ni Maurice ni Jean n’obtinrent qu’elle se tînt à l’abri, immobile. Elle se remuait, avançait la tête, voulait quand même regarder vers le petit bois, dans une préoccupation constante. Eux, tiraient toujours, la repoussaient du genou, quand elle se découvrait trop. Sans doute, les Prussiens commençaient à s’estimer en nombre suffisant, prêts à l’attaque, car ils se montraient, un flot moutonnait et débordait entre les arbres ; et ils subissaient des pertes terribles, toutes les balles françaises portaient, culbutaient des hommes.","From then on, neither Maurice nor Jean got her to stay in the shelter, motionless. She stirred, put her head forward, wanted all the same to look towards the little wood, in constant preoccupation. They were always pulling, pushing her away with their knees when she uncovered too much. Doubtless the Prussians were beginning to consider themselves in sufficient numbers, ready to attack, for they were showing themselves, a flood was billowing and overflowing between the trees; and they suffered terrible losses, all the French bullets carried, knocked down men.","After that neither Maurice nor Jean could get her to keep still under cover. She was constantly on the move, sticking out her head, determined, come what may, to watch the little wood, with one fixed idea. They went on firing and jerked her back with their knees if she ventured too far out. Presumably the Prussians were beginning to think they were now sufficiently numerous and ready to attack, for they were now showing themselves in a flood spilling out between the trees, and they were sustaining terrible losses as each French bullet was accurate and picked off its man.","After that all Jean's and Maurice's entreaties were ineffectual to make her keep quiet. She was feverishly restless, constantly protruding her head to peer into the opposite wood, evidently harassed by some anxiety that preyed upon her mind. Her companions continued to load and fire with the same blind fury, pushing her back with their knee whenever she exposed herself too rashly. It looked as if the Prussians were beginning to consider that their numbers would warrant them in attacking, for they showed themselves more frequently and there were evidences of preparations going on behind the trees. They were suffering severely, however, from the fire of the French, whose bullets at that short range rarely failed to bring down their man."
"Autour d’eux, cependant, les hommes s’étaient endormis, malgré les tiraillements des estomacs. La fatigue, trop grande, emportait la peur, les terrassait tous sur le dos, la bouche ouverte, anéantis sous le ciel sans lune. L’attente, d’un bout à l’autre des coteaux nus, était tombée à un silence de mort.","Around them, however, the men had fallen asleep, despite the pangs of their stomachs. Fatigue, too great, took away the fear, crushed them all on their backs, their mouths open, annihilated under the moonless sky. Waiting across the bare hillsides had fallen to dead silence.","But most of the men round them had gone to sleep in spite of the clawing at their stomachs. Excess of fatigue had taken away their fear and knocked them out on their backs, with their mouths gaping, dead to the world under the moonless sky. From end to end of the bare hills the time of waiting had sunk into a deathly silence.","On every side, meantime, the men, notwithstanding the complainings of their empty stomachs, had thrown themselves down to sleep. Their fatigue was so great that it finally got the better of their fears and struck them down upon the bare earth, where they lay on their back, with open mouth and arms outstretched, like logs beneath the moonless sky. The bustle of the camp was stilled, and all along the naked range, from end to end, there reigned a silence as of death."
"Son frère, mon Dieu ! son Maurice adoré par delà la naissance, qui était un autre elle-même, qu’elle avait élevé, sauvé ! son unique tendresse, depuis qu’elle avait vu, à Bazeilles, contre un mur, le corps de son pauvre Weiss troué de balles ! La guerre achevait donc de lui prendre tout son cœur, elle resterait donc seule au monde, veuve et dépareillée, sans personne qui l’aimerait !","His brother, my God! her Maurice adored beyond birth, who was another herself, whom she had brought up, saved! her only tenderness, since she had seen, at Bazeilles, against a wall, the body of her poor Weiss riddled with bullet holes! The war was therefore taking all her heart away from her, so she would remain alone in the world, widowed and mismatched, without anyone who would love her!","Her brother, oh God, her Maurice whom she had worshipped even from their mother’s womb, who was her second self, whom she had brought up and saved! Her only love since she had seen her poor Weiss’s body riddled with bullets against a wall in Bazeilles! So the war was taking her whole heart, and she would be left alone in the world, a lonely widow with no one to love her.","I hastened to his side, but had barely time to reach the bed before he expired, with my name upon his lips, and yours as well, amid an outgush of blood—” Her Maurice, her twin brother, whom she might almost be said to have loved in the prenatal state, her other self, whom she had watched over and saved! sole object of her affection since at Bazeilles she had seen her poor Weiss set against a wall and shot to death! And now cruel war had done its worst by her, had crushed her bleeding heart; henceforth her way through life was to be a solitary one, widowed and forsaken as she was, with no one upon whom to bestow her love."
"Honoré s’approcha de Silvine, et doucement, en face de ces ténèbres, où passaient des frissons farouches :","Honoré approached Silvine, and gently, in the face of this darkness, where fierce shivers passed:","Honoré went up to Silvine and said softly, in the frightening darkness:","Honore drew his chair nearer to Silvine, and in the shuddering darkness, alive with all those sounds of menace, gently whispered:"
"Silvine, qui était restée assise, avec Charlot sur les genoux, n’avait pas quitté Prosper des yeux. Lorsqu’elle le vit se lever, pour se rendre tout de suite à l’écurie et faire la connaissance des bêtes, elle demanda de nouveau :","Silvine, who had remained seated with Charlot on her knees, had not taken her eyes off Prosper. When she saw him get up, to go immediately to the stable and meet the animals, she asked again:","Silvine was still sitting there with Chariot on her lap, and she had never taken her eyes off Prosper. When she saw him getting up to go straight off to the stable and get to know the horses, she asked him once again:","Silvine, who had remained seated with Charlot on her lap, had never once taken her eyes from Prosper's face. When she saw him rise with the intention of going to the stable and making immediate acquaintance with its four-footed inhabitants, she again asked:"
"– Voyons, avec des bons bougres comme vous, est-ce qu’on ne passe pas où l’on veut ?… Je trouverai bien cinquante bons bougres pour se faire encore casser la gueule.","""Look, with good buggers like you, don't we go where we want?... I'll find fifty good buggers to get their ass kicked in again.""","‘Come on, with some good chaps like you couldn’t we get anywhere we wanted? I can surely find fifty stalwart fellows ready to fight it out.’","“What, with a few daring fellows of your stripe, do you mean to say we couldn't go where we please? I think I can find fifty daredevils to risk their skin in the attempt.”"
"Mais Delaherche s’étonnait d’entendre toujours le canon. Pourquoi donc ne se taisait-il pas ? La nappe de Rose, maintenant, devait être hissée sur la citadelle. Et on aurait dit, au contraire, que le tir des batteries prussiennes augmentait d’intensité. C’était un vacarme à ne pas s’entendre, un ébranlement secouant les moins nerveux de la tête aux pieds, dans une angoisse croissante. Cela ne devait guère être bon, pour les opérateurs et pour les opérés, ces secousses qui vous arrachaient le cœur. L’ambulance entière en était bousculée, enfiévrée, jusqu’à l’exaspération.","But Delaherche was surprised to still hear the cannon. Why was he not silent? Rose's tablecloth now had to be hoisted onto the citadel. And it seemed, on the contrary, that the fire from the Prussian batteries was increasing in intensity. It was an unheard din, a shaking that shook the less nervous from head to toe in mounting anguish. It could hardly have been good, for the operators and for the operated, these shocks which tore out your heart. The entire ambulance was jostled, feverish, to the point of exasperation.","Delaherche was amazed that he could still hear the guns. Why hadn’t they stopped? Surely Rose’s tableloth must now be hoisted above the citadel. It seemed, on the contrary, that the Prussians’ fire was growing in intensity. The ear-splitting din shook even the least nervous from head to foot in growing distress. It could hardly be good for operators or patients, for these explosions pulled your insides out. The whole ambulance station was upset by them and being strained to breaking-point.","When Delaherche had in some degree recovered his equanimity he was astonished to notice that the bombardment was still going on. Why had it not been silenced? Rose's tablecloth must have been hoisted over the citadel by that time, and yet it seemed as if the fire of the Prussian batteries was more rapid and furious than ever. The uproar was such that one could not hear his own voice; the sustained vibration tried the stoutest nerves. On both operators and patients the effect could not but be most unfavorable of those incessant detonations that seemed to penetrate the inmost recesses of one's being. The entire hospital was in a state of feverish alarm and apprehension."
"Enfin, le vieux daigna expliquer qu’il était tout de même allé, le matin, au marché de Raucourt, avec sa carriole, en emmenant sa servante. Ce n’était pas une raison, parce qu’il passait des soldats, pour que le monde cessât de manger de la viande et pour qu’on ne fît plus ses affaires. Il avait donc, comme tous les mardis, emporté là-bas un mouton et un quartier de bœuf ; et il achevait sa vente, lorsque l’arrivée du 7e corps l’avait jeté au milieu d’une bagarre épouvantable. On courait, on se bousculait. Alors, il avait eu peur qu’on ne lui prît sa voiture et son cheval, il était parti, en abandonnant Silvine, qui faisait justement des commissions dans le bourg.","Finally, the old man condescended to explain that he had all the same gone that morning to the market at Raucourt, with his cart, taking his servant with him. That was no reason, because soldiers were passing by, for people to stop eating meat and to go about their business. So he had, like every Tuesday, taken a mutton and a quarter of beef there; and he was completing his sale, when the arrival of the 7th corps had thrown him into the midst of a terrible fight. We were running, we were jostling. So he was afraid that they would take his carriage and his horse, he left, leaving Silvine, who happened to be doing errands in the town.","Finally the old man condescended to explain that he had gone as usual that morning to market in Raucourt, taking her with him in the cart. Because soldiers were going through the town that was no reason for people to give up eating meat and for business to stop. So, as always on Tuesdays, he had taken a sheep and a quarter of beef and he was finishing selling them when the arrival of the 7th corps had landed him in the middle of a terrible shindy, everybody running about and knocking each other over. So he had been afraid of somebody taking his horse and cart and had gone, not waiting for Silvine, who was doing some errands in the town.","Finally the old fellow condescended to explain that he, too, had been taking an outing that morning, had driven over to Raucourt market in his wagon and taken his little servant with him. He saw no reason, because a lot of soldiers happened to pass that way, why folks should cease to eat meat or why a man should not attend to his business, so he had taken a sheep and a quarter of beef over there, as it was his custom to do every Tuesday, and had just disposed of the last of his stock-in-trade when up came the 7th corps and he found himself in the middle of a terrible hubbub. Everyone was running, pushing, and crowding. Then he became alarmed lest they should take his horse and wagon from him, and drove off, leaving his servant, who was just then making some purchases in the town."
– Non !,- Nope !,‘No!’,“No!”
"– Ça ne va toujours pas, hein ? Est-ce que c’est ton pied encore ?","“Still not okay, huh? Is that your foot again?",‘Not too good? Is it still that foot of yours?’,“Are you feeling so badly still? What is it? Does your foot pain you?”
"Devant le capitaine Beaudoin, Gilberte avait frémi. Mon Dieu ! qu’il était pâle, couché sur ce matelas, la face toute blanche sous la saleté qui la souillait ! Et la pensée que, quelques heures auparavant, il l’avait tenue entre ses bras, plein de vie et sentant bon, la glaçait d’effroi. Elle s’était agenouillée.","In front of Captain Beaudoin, Gilberte had shuddered. My God ! how pale he was, lying on this mattress, his face quite white under the filth that sullied it! And the thought that, a few hours before, he had held her in his arms, full of life and smelling good, froze her with dread. She had knelt down.","When she saw Captain Beaudoin Gilberte had shuddered. Oh God, how pale he looked as he lay on that mattress, with his face quite white under the dirt that soiled it! The thought that only a few hours ago he had held her in his arms and was so full of life and smelt so sweet, froze her with horror. She knelt down.","Gilberte shuddered as she looked on Captain Beaudoin. Good God! how pale he was, stretched out on his mattress, his face so white beneath the encrusting grime! And the thought that but a few short hours before he had held her in his arms, radiant in all his manly strength and beauty, sent a chill of terror to her heart. She kneeled beside him."
– Est-ce qu’il vous a forcée ?… Est-ce que vous avez consenti ?,"""Did he force you? Did you consent?""",‘Did he force you?… Did you consent?’,"“Did he take advantage of you, or was it with your consent?”"
"La violence des balles venait d’arracher une persienne de ses gonds. Mais Weiss se précipita, poussa une armoire contre la fenêtre ; et Laurent, embusqué derrière, put continuer son tir. Un des soldats gisait à ses pieds, la mâchoire fracassée, perdant beaucoup de sang. Un autre reçut une balle dans la gorge, roula jusqu’au mur, où il râla sans fin, avec un frisson convulsif de tout le corps. Ils n’étaient plus que huit, en ne comptant pas le capitaine, qui, trop affaibli pour parler, adossé au fond du lit, donnait encore des ordres, par gestes. De même que le grenier, les trois chambres du premier étage commençaient à devenir intenables, car les matelas en lambeaux n’arrêtaient plus les projectiles : des éclats de plâtre sautaient des murs et du plafond, les meubles s’écornaient, les flancs de l’armoire se fendaient comme sous des coups de hache. Et le pis était que les munitions allaient manquer.","The violence of the bullets had just torn a shutter from its hinges. But Weiss rushed forward, pushed a cupboard against the window; and Laurent, ambushed behind, was able to continue his fire. One of the soldiers was lying at his feet, his jaw shattered, losing a lot of blood. Another was shot in the throat, rolled to the wall, where he gasped endlessly, with a convulsive shudder all over his body. There were only eight of them, not counting the captain, who, too weak to speak, leaning against the bottom of the bed, was still giving orders by gestures. Like the attic, the three bedrooms on the first floor were beginning to become untenable, for the tattered mattresses no longer stopped the projectiles: shards of plaster were flying from the walls and ceiling, the furniture was chipping, the sides of the cupboard split like an axe. And the worst was that the ammunition was going to run out.","The impact of the bullets had forced a shutter off its hinges. But Weiss rushed and pushed a cupboard against the window, and Laurent could go on firing, shielded by that. One of the soldiers lay at his feet, his jaw smashed and losing a lot of blood. Another was hit in the throat by a bullet and reeled over to the wall where he made a continual snoring noise, with his whole body jerking in convulsions. They were now down to eight, not counting the captain, who was too weak to speak but propped up on the bed was still giving orders by signs. The three first-floor rooms were beginning to be as untenable as the loft, for the tattered mattresses were no longer stopping the bullets: bits of plaster jumped from the walls and ceiling, furniture was being broken and sides of cupboards splitting as though under the axe. Worst of all, ammunition was running short.","The concentrated fire had torn one of the inside blinds from its hinges, but Weiss darted forward and pushed a wardrobe before the window, and Laurent was enabled to continue his operations under cover. One of the soldiers was lying at his feet with his jaw broken, losing blood freely. Another received a bullet in his chest, and dragged himself over to the wall, where he lay gasping in protracted agony, while convulsive movements shook his frame at intervals. They were but eight, now, all told, not counting the lieutenant, who, too weak to speak, his back supported by the headboard of the bed, continued to give his directions by signs. As had been the case with the attic, the three rooms of the first floor were beginning to be untenable, for the mangled mattresses no longer afforded protection against the missiles; at every instant the plaster fell in sheets from the walls and ceiling, and the furniture was in process of demolition: the sides of the wardrobe yawned as if they had been cloven by an ax. And worse still, the ammunition was nearly exhausted."
"Obligeamment, pour leur éviter quelque algarade, Jean crut devoir intervenir.","Obligingly, to spare them some trouble, Jean thought he had to intervene.","Out of kindness, to save them from being told off, Jean felt he ought to intervene.","In the kindness of his heart, in order to save them a reprimand, if not something worse, Jean stepped up to them and said:"
"Alors, Delaherche répondit par une longue phrase. Mais sa voix se perdit, au milieu du roulement des pieds. Il dut comprendre que le jeune homme ne l’avait pas entendu, car il multiplia les signes, il en répéta un surtout, là-bas, vers le sud. Déjà, la colonne s’engageait dans la rue du Ménil, la façade de la fabrique disparut, avec les trois têtes qui se penchaient, tandis qu’une main agitait un mouchoir.","Then Delaherche replied with a long sentence. But her voice trailed off, amid the rolling of her feet. He must have understood that the young man had not heard him, for he multiplied the signs, he repeated one above all, over there, towards the south. Already the column was entering the rue du Ménil, the facade of the factory disappeared, with the three heads leaning forward, while a hand waved a handkerchief.","Delaherche answered with a long sentence, but his voice was lost in the tramp of feet. He must have realized that the young man had not caught what he said, for he made many signs, and repeated one especially, southwards. But already the column was entering rue du Ménil, and the façade of the factory, with the three heads leaning out, disappeared, but a hand still waved a handkerchief.","Delaherche replied with a long farrago, but his voice was inaudible in the shuffling tramp of so many feet. He seemed to understand that the young man had failed to catch his meaning, for he gesticulated like a semaphore; there was one gesture in particular that he repeated several times, extending his arm with a sweeping motion toward the south, apparently intending to convey the idea of some point in the remote distance: Off there, away off there. Already the head of the column was wheeling into the Rue du Minil, the facade of the factory was lost to sight, together with the kindly faces of the three Delaherches; the last the two friends saw of them was the fluttering of the white handkerchief with which Gilberte waved them a farewell."
"Jean, qui se taisait, l’interrompit, d’un cri d’angoisse :","Jean, who was silent, interrupted him with a cry of anguish:","Jean, who had kept quiet, broke in with a cry of anguish:","Jean, who had been watching events in silence, gave utterance to a distressful cry:"

"– Capitaine, vous accepterez bien un petit verre… Voyez-vous, je ne me gêne pas, je vous dis tout ce que je pense, parce que je connais la largeur de votre esprit. Eh bien ! je vous assure que votre préfet a tort de vouloir saigner encore la ville de ces quarante-deux mille francs… Songez donc au total de nos sacrifices, depuis le commencement. D’abord, à la veille de la bataille, toute une armée française, épuisée, affamée. Ensuite, vous autres, qui aviez les dents longues aussi. Rien que les passages de ces troupes, les réquisitions, les réparations, les dépenses de toute sorte nous ont coûté un million et demi. Mettez-en autant pour les ruines occasionnées par la bataille, les destructions, les incendies : ça fait trois millions. Enfin, j’évalue bien à deux millions la perte éprouvée par l’industrie et le commerce… Hein ? qu’est-ce que vous en dites ? Nous voilà au chiffre de cinq millions, pour une ville de treize mille habitants ! Et vous nous demandez encore quarante-deux mille francs de contribution, je ne sais sous quel prétexte ! est-ce que c’est juste, est-ce que c’est raisonnable ?","– Captain, you will accept a little drink… You see, I don't hesitate, I tell you everything I think, because I know the breadth of your mind. Well ! I assure you that your prefect is wrong to want to bleed the town again with these forty-two thousand francs… Just think of the total of our sacrifices, since the beginning. First, on the eve of the battle, a whole French army, exhausted, starving. Then you guys who had long teeth too. The passages of these troops alone, the requisitions, the repairs, the expenses of all kinds have cost us a million and a half. Put as much for the ruins caused by the battle, the destruction, the fires: that makes three millions. Finally, I estimate the loss suffered by industry and commerce at two million. Hein? what do you say about it ? Here we are at the figure of five million, for a city of thirteen thousand inhabitants! And you're asking us for another forty-two thousand francs to contribute, I don't know under what pretext! is it fair, is it reasonable?","‘Captain, do have a brandy… You see, I’m not standing on ceremony, but saying whatever I think, because I know how broad-minded you are. Well then, I assure you that your prefect is making a mistake by insisting on bleeding the town still more with this forty-two thousand francs. Just think what our sacrifices add up to since the beginning. First, just before the battle, the whole of the French army, exhausted and ravenous. Then you, and you were famished too. Just these troops going through, requisitions, repairs, expenses of all kinds, these things alone have cost us a million and a half. Add to that as much again for damage caused by the battle, destruction, fires – that makes three million. And finally I estimate the loss to industry and commerce at two million… Well now, what do you say to that! That brings us to a figure of five million for a town of thirteen thousand inhabitants! And you are asking for another levy of forty-two thousand , I don’t quite know what for! Is it fair? Is it reasonable?’","“Captain, you'll have a petit verre with me. You see I don't stand on ceremony with you; I say whatever comes into my head, because I know you to be a fair-minded man. Now I tell you your prefet is all wrong in trying to extort those forty-two thousand francs from the city. Just think once of all our losses since the beginning of the war. In the first place, before the battle, we had the entire French army on our hands, a set of ragged, hungry, exhausted men; and then along came your rascals, and their appetites were not so very poor, either. The passage of those troops through the place, what with requisitions, repairing damages and expenses of all sorts, stood us in a million and a half. Add as much more for the destruction caused by your artillery and by conflagration during the battle; there you have three millions. Finally, I am well within bounds in estimating the loss sustained by our trade and manufactures at two millions. What do you say to that, eh? A grand total of five million francs for a city of thirteen thousand inhabitants! And now you come and ask us for forty-two thousand more as a contribution to the expense of carrying on the war against us! Is it fair, is it reasonable? I leave it to your own sense of justice.”"

– Ils nous embêtent à la fin ! répétaient Pache et Lapoulle eux-mêmes. Ça soulagerait de leur envoyer des pruneaux !,- They bother us at the end! repeated Pache and Lapoulle themselves. It would be a relief to send them prunes!,Even Pache and Lapoulle were saying: ‘They’re beginning to get us down and it would do us good to slosh ’em one or two!’,"It eventually produced a disheartening effect on the troops to see that cordon closing in on them in the distance and enveloping them as in the meshes of some gigantic, invisible net. Even Pache and Lapoulle had an opinion on the subject. “It is beginning to be tiresome!” they said. “It would be a comfort to send them our compliments in the shape of a musket-ball!”"

"Mais un galop, à leur gauche, leur fit tourner la tête. Ils reconnurent le général Douay, suivi de son état-major, accouru pour se rendre compte de la solidité de ses troupes, sous le feu terrible du Hattoy. Il sembla satisfait, il donnait quelques ordres, lorsque, débouchant d’un chemin creux, le général Bourgain-Desfeuilles parut à son tour. Ce dernier, tout soldat de cour qu’il était, trottait insouciamment au milieu des projectiles, entêté dans sa routine d’Afrique, n’ayant profité d’aucune leçon. Il criait et gesticulait comme Rochas.","But a gallop to their left made them turn their heads.

He shouted and gesticulated like Rochas.","A galloping on their left made them look up. They recognized General Douay, followed by his staff, who had hurried over to gauge the morale of his troops under the murderous fire from Le Hattoy. He seemed satisfied, and was giving some orders when General Bourgain-Desfeuilles also appeared, emerging from a sunken road. The latter, although a court soldier, was trotting quite unruffled amid the shells, hidebound in his African colonial routine and having learned nothing. He was shouting and gesticulating like Rochas.","Their attention was attracted by the sound of mounted men approaching on their left, and turning their heads they beheld General Douay, who, accompanied by his staff, had come galloping up to see how his troops were behaving under the terrible fire from Hattoy. He appeared well pleased with what he saw and was in the act of making some suggestions to the officers grouped around him, when, emerging from a sunken road, General Bourgain-Desfeuilles also rode up. This officer, though he owed his advancement to “influence” was wedded to the antiquated African routine and had learned nothing by experience, sat his horse with great composure under the storm of projectiles. He was shouting to the men and gesticulating wildly, after the manner of Rochas: “They are coming, they will be here right away,"
"Brusquement, Maurice, les yeux rêveurs et perdus, relut là-bas, devant lui, le cri : Vive Napoléon ! charbonné sur le grand mur jaune. Et il eut une sensation d’intolérable malaise, un élancement dont la brûlure lui trouait le cœur. C’était donc vrai que cette France, aux victoires légendaires, et qui s’était promenée, tambours battants, au travers de l’Europe, venait d’être culbutée du premier coup par un petit peuple dédaigné ? Cinquante ans avaient suffi, le monde était changé, la défaite s’abattait effroyable sur les éternels vainqueurs. Et il se souvenait de tout ce que Weiss, son beau-frère, avait dit, pendant la nuit d’angoisse, devant Mulhouse. Oui, lui seul alors était clairvoyant, devinait les causes lentes et cachées de notre affaiblissement, sentait le vent nouveau de jeunesse et de force qui soufflait d’Allemagne. N’était-ce pas un âge guerrier qui finissait, un autre qui commençait ? Malheur à qui s’arrête dans l’effort continu des nations, la victoire est à ceux qui marchent à l’avant-garde, aux plus savants, aux plus sains, aux plus forts !","Suddenly, Maurice, with dreamy and lost eyes, reread over there, in front of him, the cry: Long live Napoleon! charred on the big yellow wall. And he had a feeling of intolerable uneasiness, a twinge of which the burning pierced his heart. So it was true that this France, with legendary victories, which had marched, drums beating, through Europe, had just been overthrown at the first blow by a despised little people? Fifty years had sufficed, the world had changed, defeat fell horribly on the eternal victors. And he remembered all that Weiss, his brother-in-law, had said, during the night of anguish, in front of Mulhouse. Yes, he alone was clairvoyant then, guessed the slow and hidden causes of our weakening, felt the new wind of youth and strength blowing from Germany. Wasn't it a warrior age that was ending, another that was beginning? Woe to him who stops in the continuous effort of nations, victory belongs to those who march in the vanguard, to the most learned, to the healthiest, to the strongest!","Then Maurice’s eyes, lost in a reverie, suddenly focused again on the slogan Long Live Napoleon chalked on the yellow wall in front of him. It gave him a sensation of unbearable distress, a twinge of pain that stabbed him to the heart. So it was true that this France, with her legendary victories, who had marched across Europe with drums rolling, had now been knocked over at the first push by a contemptible little country? Fifty years had sufficed to do it, the world had changed and ghastly defeat was swooping down on the eternal conquerors. He recalled all the things his brother-in-law Weiss had said on the dreadful night outside Mulhouse. Yes, he had been the only one to see clearly and guess at the long-standing hidden causes of our weakness, to sense the new wind of youth and strength blowing from Germany. Was it not the end of one military age and the beginning of another? Woe to whoever stands still in the ceaseless thrust of nations, victory is to those who march in the forefront, the most scientific, the healthiest, the strongest!","In the midst of his uncheerful revery, Maurice's eyes suddenly lighted on the legend scrawled on the wall before him—Vive Napoleon! and a sensation of intolerable distress seemed to pierce his heart like a red hot iron. Could it be true, then, that France, whose victories were the theme of song and story everywhere, the great nation whose drums had sounded throughout the length and breadth of Europe, had been thrown in the dust at the first onset by an insignificant race, despised of everyone? Fifty years had sufficed to compass it; the world had changed, and defeat most fearful had overtaken those who had been deemed invincible. He remembered the words that had been uttered by Weiss his brother-in-law, during that evening of anxiety when they were at Mulhausen. Yes, he alone of them had been clear of vision, had penetrated the hidden causes that had long been slowly sapping our strength, had felt the freshening gale of youth and progress under the impulse of which Germany was being wafted onward to prosperity and power. Was not the old warlike age dying and a new one coming to the front? Woe to that one among the nations which halted in its onward march! the victory is to those who are with the advance-guard, to those who are clear of head and strong of body, to the most powerful."

For the moment his physical and mental depression is such that the only thing to do is to let him sleep. To-morrow we shall know more.”"
"Le jour naissait, lorsque le 7e corps quitta Oches, en marche pour Mouzon, par la Besace, où il aurait dû coucher. D’abord, le terrible convoi était parti, accompagné par la 1re division ; et, si les voitures du train, bien attelées, filaient d’un bon pas, les autres, les voitures de réquisition, vides pour la plupart et inutiles, s’attardaient singulièrement dans les côtes du défilé de Stonne. La route monte, surtout après le hameau de la Berlière, entre des mamelons boisés qui la dominent. Vers huit heures, au moment où les deux autres divisions s’ébranlaient enfin, le maréchal de Mac-Mahon parut, exaspéré de trouver encore là des troupes qu’il croyait parties de la Besace, le matin, n’ayant à faire que quelques kilomètres pour être rendues à Mouzon. Aussi eut-il une explication vive avec le général Douay. Il fut décidé qu’on laisserait la 1re division et le convoi continuer leur marche vers Mouzon ; mais que les deux autres divisions, pour ne pas être retardées davantage, par cette lourde avant-garde, si lente, prendraient la route de Raucourt et d’Autrecourt, afin d’aller passer la Meuse à Villers. C’était, de nouveau, remonter vers le nord, dans la hâte que le maréchal avait de mettre le fleuve entre son armée et l’ennemi. Coûte que coûte, il fallait être sur la rive droite le soir. Et l’arrière-garde était encore à Oches, quand une batterie prussienne, d’un sommet lointain, du côté de Saint-Pierremont, tira, recommençant le jeu de la veille. D’abord, on eut le tort de répondre ; puis, les dernières troupes se replièrent.","Day was breaking when the 7th corps left Oches, marching for Mouzon, by La Besace, where it should have slept. First, the terrible convoy had left, accompanied by the 1st Division; and, if the carriages of the train, well harnessed, sped along at a good pace, the others, the requisition carriages, mostly empty and useless, lingered singularly on the slopes of the defile of Stonne. The road climbs, especially after the hamlet of La Berlière, between wooded hillocks which dominate it. Towards eight o'clock, at the moment when the two other divisions were finally moving, Marshal de Mac-Mahon appeared, exasperated to find troops still there, whom he thought had left La Besace in the morning, having only a few kilometers to be returned to Mouzon. So he had a heated argument with General Douay. It was decided that the 1st Division and the convoy would be left to continue their march towards Mouzon; but that the two other divisions, so as not to be further delayed by this heavy vanguard, so slow, would take the road to Raucourt and Autrecourt, in order to cross the Meuse at Villers. It was again going north, in the marshal's haste to put the river between his army and the enemy. Come what may, you had to be on the right bank in the evening. And the rear guard was still at Oches, when a Prussian battery, from a distant summit, near Saint-Pierremont, fired, resuming the game of the day before. At first, they were wrong to answer; then the last troops fell back.","Day was breaking as the 7th left Oches, making for Mouzon via La Besace, where it should have slept that night. The accursed supply column had left first with the first division, and if the proper army waggons which had first-rate horses made good speed, the others, the requisitioned ones, mostly empty and useless, dawdled astonishingly on the gradients of the gorge of Stonne. The road climbs, particularly after the hamlet of La Berlière, between wooded hills which overlook it. At about eight, when the two remaining divisions were at last beginning to move, Marshal MacMahon appeared and was furious to find still there troops which he thought had left La Besace that morning with only a few kilometres to do to be right on time at Mouzon. And so he had a violent altercation with General Douay. It was decided that the first division and the supply train should be left to continue their march to Mouzon, but that the two other divisions, so as not to be slowed down any more by the cumbersome advance guard, would take the road to Raucourt and Autrecourt so as to cross the Meuse at Villers. This once again meant turning northwards, in the haste the marshal was making to put the river between his army and the enemy. Cost what it may, they had to be on the right bank that evening. And the rearguard was still at Oches when a Prussian battery opened fire from a distant height near Saint-Pierremont, renewing the tactics of the day before. At first they made the mistake of answering their fire, but then the last troops pulled out.","Day was breaking when the 7th corps marched out of Osches en route for Mouzon by way of la Besace, where they should have bivouacked. The train, cause of so many woes, had been sent on ahead, guarded by the first division, and if its own wagons, well horsed as for the most part they were, got over the ground at a satisfactory pace, the requisitioned vehicles, most of them empty, delayed the troops and produced sad confusion among the hills of the defile of Stonne. After leaving the hamlet of la Berliere the road rises more sharply between wooded hills on either side. Finally, about eight o'clock, the two remaining divisions got under way, when Marshal MacMahon came galloping up, vexed to find there those troops that he supposed had left la Besace that morning, with only a short march between them and Mouzon; his comment to General Douay on the subject was expressed in warm language. It was determined that the first division and the train should be allowed to proceed on their way to Mouzon, but that the two other divisions, that they might not be further retarded by this cumbrous advance-guard, should move by the way of Raucourt and Autrecourt so as to pass the Meuse at Villers. The movement to the north was dictated by the marshal's intense anxiety to place the river between his army and the enemy; cost what it might, they must be on the right bank that night. The rear-guard had not yet left Osches when a Prussian battery, recommencing the performance of the previous day, began to play on them from a distant eminence, over in the direction of Saint-Pierremont. They made the mistake of firing a few shots in reply; then the last of the troops filed out of the town."
"Mais, d’un geste de supplication, elle le fit taire. Réveillé par le bruit, Charlot avait levé la tête. Les yeux vagues, comme au sortir d’un rêve, il se rappela l’injure que lui avait apprise quelque farceur du village, il déclara de son air grave de petit bonhomme de trois ans :","But, with a gesture of supplication, she silenced him. Awakened by the noise, Charlot had raised his head. With vacant eyes, as if coming out of a dream, he remembered the insult that some joker from the village had taught him, he declared with his grave air of a little fellow of three years old:","She made a sign begging him to stop. But the noise had awakened Chariot, and he looked up. His eyes still out of focus as though he were emerging from a dream, he remembered the insult he had been taught by some Clever Dick in the village, and declared with all the solemnity of a young man of three:","She gave him an entreating glance that silenced his rude attempt at gallantry. Charlot, awakened by the sound of their voices, had raised his head. With the blinking eyes of one suddenly aroused from slumber he looked about the room, and recalled the words that some idle fellow of the village had taught him; and with the solemn gravity of a little man of three he announced:"
"Le jour baissait, la retraite partit d’un coin éloigné du camp, un roulement des tambours, une sonnerie des clairons, faibles encore, emportés par le grand air. Et Jean Macquart, qui s’occupait à consolider la tente, en enfonçant les piquets davantage, se leva. Aux premiers bruits de guerre, il avait quitté Rognes, tout saignant du drame où il venait de perdre sa femme Françoise et les terres qu’elle lui avait apportées ; il s’était réengagé à trente-neuf ans, retrouvant ses galons de caporal, tout de suite incorporé au 106e régiment de ligne, dont on complétait les cadres ; et, parfois, il s’étonnait encore, de se revoir avec la capote aux épaules, lui qui, après Solférino, était si joyeux de quitter le service, de n’être plus un traîneur de sabre, un tueur de monde. Mais quoi faire ? quand on n’a plus de métier, qu’on n’a plus ni femme ni bien au soleil, que le cœur vous saute dans la gorge de tristesse et de rage ? Autant vaut-il cogner sur les ennemis, s’ils vous embêtent. Et il se rappelait son cri : ah ! bon sang ! puisqu’il n’avait plus de courage à la travailler, il la défendrait, la vieille terre de France !","The day was falling, the retreat started from a distant corner of the camp, a roll of drums, a sound of bugles, still weak, carried away by the open air. And Jean Macquart, who was busy strengthening the tent by driving in the pegs further, got up. At the first rumors of war, he had left Rognes, all bleeding from the tragedy in which he had just lost his wife Françoise and the lands she had brought him; he had re-enlisted at the age of thirty-nine, regaining his corporal's stripes, immediately incorporated into the 106th line regiment, whose officers were being completed; and sometimes he was still surprised to see himself again with the greatcoat over his shoulders, he who, after Solferino, was so happy to leave the service, to no longer be a swordsman, a killer of people. But what to do? when you no longer have a job, when you no longer have a wife or a good place in the sun, when your heart jumps in your throat with sadness and rage? It is as well to hit the enemies, if they bother you. And he remembered her cry: ah! damn it ! since he no longer had the courage to work it, he would defend it, the old land of France!","The light was fading and retreat was heard in some distant corner of the camp, a drum-roll and sound of bugles, still faint and carried away into the air. And Jean Macquart, who had been busy strengthening the tent by driving the pegs further in, straightened up. At the first rumour of war he had left Rognes, the wound still raw from the drama in which he had lost his wife Françoise and the land she had brought as dowry. He had re-enlisted at the age of thirty-nine, got back his corporal’s stripes and been at once drafted to the 106th foot, which was then being brought up to full strength, and he was still amazed sometimes to find himself once again with his cape on his shoulders, for he had been overjoyed to get out of the services after Solferino and not be a sword-waver and killer any more. But what is a chap to do when he hasn’t a job, a wife or a bean left under the sun and his heart is turning over inside him with grief and rage? You might just as well have it out on the enemy if they get you down. And now he recalled the exclamation he had made – Oh bugger it, as he hadn’t got the guts left to till this old French soil he might as well defend it!","The day was drawing to an end, and from a remote corner of the camp the rattling drums and the shrill bugles sounded retreat, the sound dying away faintly in the distance on the still air of evening. Jean Macquart, who had been securing the tent and driving the pegs home, rose to his feet. When it began to be rumored that there was to be war he had left Rognes, the scene of the bloody drama in which he had lost his wife, Francoise and the acres that she brought him; he had re-enlisted at the age of thirty-nine, and been assigned to the 106th of the line, of which they were at that time filling up the cadres, with his old rank of corporal, and there were moments when he could not help wondering how it ever came about that he, who after Solferino had been so glad to quit the service and cease endangering his own and other people's lives, was again wearing the capote of the infantry man. But what is a man to do, when he has neither trade nor calling, neither wife, house, nor home, and his heart is heavy with mingled rage and sorrow? As well go and have a shot at the enemy, if they come where they are not wanted. And he remembered his old battle cry: Ah! bon sang! if he had no longer heart for honest toil, he would go and defend her, his country, the old land of France!"
"Mais le lieutenant voulait savoir si Bazaine arrivait. Et Prosper eut un geste vague : est-ce qu’on pouvait dire ? Eux, depuis le 16, avaient passé les journées en marches et contremarches sous la pluie, en reconnaissances, en grand’gardes, sans voir un ennemi. Maintenant, ils faisaient partie de l’armée de Châlons. Son régiment, deux autres de chasseurs de France et un de hussards, formaient l’une des divisions de la cavalerie de réserve, la 1re division, commandée par le général Margueritte, dont il parlait avec une tendresse enthousiaste.","But the lieutenant wanted to know if Bazaine was coming. And Prosper made a vague gesture: could one tell? They, since the 16th, had passed the days in marches and counter-marches in the rain, in reconnaissance, on guard duty, without seeing an enemy. Now they were part of the Army of Châlons. His regiment, two others of chasseurs de France and one of hussars, formed one of the divisions of the reserve cavalry, the 1st division, commanded by General Margueritte, of whom he spoke with enthusiastic tenderness.","But the lieutenant meant was Bazaine coming? Prosper made a vague gesture: how could anyone say? Since the 16th they had been spending the days in marches and counter-marches in the rain, reconnaissances, outposts that had never seen an enemy. Now he was attached to the army of Châlons. His regiment, two others of the Chasseurs de France and one of the Hussars, made up one of the reserve cavalry divisions, the first, commanded by General Margueritte, whom he spoke of with enthusiasm and affection.","But the Lieutenant wanted to know if Bazaine was coming to join them, whereon Prosper made a gesture expressive of uncertainty; what did any one know?

"Là-bas, ce qui intéressait Delaherche, c’étaient ces batteries. Il fouillait de ses yeux vifs les coteaux de la Marfée, lorsqu’il eut l’idée de la lunette d’approche qu’il s’amusait autrefois à braquer sur les environs, du haut de la terrasse. Il descendit la chercher, remonta, l’installa ; et, comme il s’orientait, faisant à petits mouvements défiler les terres, les arbres, les maisons, il tomba, au-dessus de la grande batterie de Frénois, sur le groupe d’uniformes que Weiss avait deviné de Bazeilles, à l’angle d’un bois de pins. Mais lui, grâce au grandissement, aurait compté les officiers de cet état-major, tellement il les voyait avec netteté. Plusieurs étaient à demi couchés dans l’herbe, d’autres debout formaient des groupes ; et, en avant, il y avait un homme seul, l’air sec et mince, à l’uniforme sans éclat, dans lequel pourtant il sentit le maître. C’était bien le roi de Prusse, à peine haut comme la moitié du doigt, un de ces minuscules soldats de plomb des jouets d’enfant. Il n’en fut du reste certain que plus tard, il ne l’avait plus quitté de l’œil, revenant toujours à cet infiniment petit, dont la face, grosse comme une lentille, ne mettait qu’un point blême sous le vaste ciel bleu.","Over there, what interested Delaherche were these batteries. He was searching with his keen eyes the hills of La Marfée, when he had the idea of the telescope that he used to enjoy pointing at the surroundings, from the top of the terrace. He went down to fetch her, came back up, installed her; and, as he took his bearings, making little movements pass by the land, the trees, the houses, he fell, above the great battery of Frénois, on the group of uniforms that Weiss had guessed from Bazeilles, at the corner of a pine wood. But he, thanks to his growth, would have counted the officers of this staff, so clearly he saw them. Several were half-lying in the grass, others standing in groups; and, in front, there was a lonely man, with a dry and thin air, in a dull uniform, in which, however, he felt the master. It was indeed the King of Prussia, barely half the height of a finger, one of those tiny toy soldiers of children's toys. He was not sure of it until later, he had never taken his eyes off it, always coming back to this infinitely small, whose face, as big as a lentil, showed only a pale point under the vast blue sky.","What interested Delaherche was these batteries. He was casting a keen eye on the slopes of La Marfée when he thought of the field glasses with which he used to amuse himself looking at the surrounding country from up there. He went down to find them, came back and took up his position, and as he was getting his bearings by moving them along in little jerks, making fields, trees and houses go by, he spotted, above the big Frénois battery, the group of uniforms that Weiss had thought he could make out from Bazeilles at the corner of a pinewood. But thanks to the magnification he could easily have counted these staff officers, so clearly could he see them. Some of them were half lying in the grass, others were standing in groups, and in front there was one man standing alone, a shrivelled, thin-looking man in a plain uniform, but he felt that this man was the master. It was indeed the King of Prussia, scarcely half a finger high, like one of those tiny tin soldiers children play with. Of course he did not know this for certain until later, but he kept his eye on him, always coming back to this tiny figure, whose face, no bigger than a dot, was just a pale speck beneath the wide blue sky.","Those batteries over across the river were objects of great interest to Delaherche. He was eagerly scanning the heights of la Marfee with his naked eye, when all at once he thought of the spy-glass with which he sometimes amused himself by watching the doings of his neighbors from the terrace. He ran downstairs and got it, returned and placed it in position, and as he was slowly sweeping the horizon and trees, fields, houses came within his range of vision, he lighted on that group of uniforms, at the angle of a pine wood, over the main battery at Frenois, of which Weiss had caught a glimpse from Bazeilles. To him, however, thanks to the excellence of his glass, it would have been no difficult matter to count the number of officers of the staff, so distinctly he made them out. Some of them were reclining carelessly on the grass, others were conversing in little groups, and in front of them all stood a solitary figure, a spare, well-proportioned man to appearances, in an unostentatious uniform, who yet asserted in some indefinable way his masterhood. It was the Prussian King, scarce half finger high, one of those miniature leaden toys that afford children such delight. Although he was not certain of this identity until later on the manufacturer found himself, by reason of some inexplicable attraction, constantly returning to that diminutive puppet, whose face, scarce larger than a pin's head, was but a pale point against the immense blue sky."
"Mais, une seconde fois, Henriette se heurtait contre un obstacle infranchissable, des murs de jardin, sans chemin aucun. Son petit compagnon continuait à rire, disait qu’on passait toujours, quand on le voulait bien. Il grimpa sur le chaperon d’un mur, l’aida ensuite à le franchir. D’un saut, ils se trouvèrent dans un potager, parmi des planches de haricots et de pois. Des clôtures partout. Alors, pour en sortir, il leur fallut traverser une maison basse de jardinier. Lui, sifflant, les mains ballantes, allait le premier, ne s’étonnait de rien. Il poussa une porte, se trouva dans une chambre, passa dans une autre, où il y avait une vieille femme, la seule âme restée là sans doute. Elle semblait hébétée, debout près d’une table. Elle regarda ces deux personnes inconnues passer ainsi au travers de sa maison ; et elle ne leur dit pas un mot, et eux-mêmes ne lui adressèrent pas la parole. Déjà, de l’autre côté, ils ressortaient dans une ruelle, qu’ils purent suivre pendant un instant. Puis, d’autres difficultés se présentèrent, ce fut de la sorte, durant près d’un kilomètre, des murailles sautées, des haies franchies, une course qui coupait au plus court, par les portes des remises, les fenêtres des habitations, selon le hasard de la route qu’ils parvenaient à se frayer. Des chiens hurlaient, ils faillirent être renversés par une vache qui fuyait d’un galop furieux. Cependant, ils devaient approcher, une odeur d’incendie leur arrivait, de grandes fumées rousses, telles que de légers crêpes flottants, voilaient à chaque minute le soleil.","But, a second time, Henriette ran into an impassable obstacle, garden walls, without any path. His little companion continued to laugh, said that we always passed, when we wanted to. He climbed on the coping of a wall, then helped him to cross it. Suddenly they found themselves in a kitchen garden, among beds of beans and peas. Fences everywhere. So, to get out, they had to cross a low gardener's house. He, whistling, his hands dangling, went first, not surprised at anything. He pushed open a door, found himself in a room, went into another, where there was an old woman, the only soul left there no doubt. She looked dazed, standing near a table. She watched these two unknown persons pass thus through her house; and she said not a word to them, nor did they speak to her. Already, on the other side, they emerged into an alley, which they were able to follow for a moment. Then, other difficulties arose, it was like this, for almost a kilometer, walls jumped, hedges crossed, a race that cut as short as possible, through the doors of the sheds, the windows of the dwellings, according to the chance of the road they managed to navigate. Dogs howled, they were almost knocked down by a cow which ran away at a furious gallop. However, they had to approach, a smell of fire came to them, great red smoke, like light floating pancakes, veiled the sun every minute.","But once again Henriette came up against an impassable obstacle, garden walls and no way through. Her little companion went on laughing and said you could always get by if you wanted to. He clambered up on to the coping of a wall and helped her over. They jumped down into a vegetable garden between rows of beans and peas. Walls everywhere. So to get out of it they had to go through a gardener’s cottage. The boy went first, whistling and swinging his arms, ready for anything. He pushed open a door, found himself in a room, went through to another in which there was an old woman, probably the only living soul still there. She looked dazed, and was standing by a table. She watched these two unknown people walking like this through her home, but didn’t say a word to them, nor they to her. They were out at the other side in a narrow lane that they were able to follow for a short distance. Then fresh difficulties arose, and so it went on for nearly a kilometre, walls had to be scaled or hedges got through, they took the shortest cuts they could, through coach-house doors, windows of houses, just as it chanced on the route they managed to follow. Dogs barked, and -they were nearly knocked down by a madly galloping cow. But they must be getting near now, for there was a smell of burning, and at every moment big, ruddy clouds like floating, gauzy material veiled the sun.","But again Henriette struck up against insurmountable obstacles in the shape of hedges and garden-walls, that offered absolutely no outlet. Her irrepressible companion, still wearing his broad grin and remarking that where there was a will there was a way, climbed to the coping of a wall and assisted her to scale it. On reaching the further side they found themselves in a kitchen garden among beds of peas and string-beans and surrounded by fences on every side; their sole exit was through the little cottage of the gardener. The boy led the way, swinging his arms and whistling unconcernedly, with an expression on his face of most profound indifference. He pushed open a door that admitted him to a bedroom, from which he passed on into another room, where there was an old woman, apparently the only living being upon the premises. She was standing by a table, in a sort of dazed stupor; she looked at the two strangers who thus unceremoniously made a highway of her dwelling, but addressed them no word, nor did they speak a word to her. They vanished as quickly as they had appeared, emerging by the exit opposite their entrance upon an alley that they followed for a moment. After that there were other difficulties to be surmounted, and thus they went on for more than half a mile, scaling walls, struggling through hedges, availing themselves of every short cut that offered, it might be the door of a stable or the window of a cottage, as the exigencies of the case demanded. Dogs howled mournfully; they had a narrow escape from being run down by a cow that was plunging along, wild with terror. It seemed as if they must be approaching the village, however; there was an odor of burning wood in the air, and momentarily volumes of reddish smoke, like veils of finest gauze floating in the wind, passed athwart the sun and obscured his light."
"Mais on ne savait rien, les bruits les plus contraires circulaient. On crut un moment qu’on se remettait en route, le camp fut levé, tout le corps d’armée s’ébranla et traversa Vouziers, en ne laissant sur la rive gauche de l’Aisne qu’une brigade de la 2e division, pour continuer à surveiller la route de Monthois. Puis, brusquement, de l’autre côté de la ville, sur la rive droite, on s’arrêta, les faisceaux furent formés dans les champs et dans les prairies qui s’étendent aux deux bords de la route de Grand-Pré. Et, à ce moment, le départ du 4e hussards, s’éloignant au grand trot par cette route, fit faire toutes sortes de conjectures.","But we knew nothing, the most contrary rumors circulated. They thought for a moment that they were on the road again, the camp was broken, the whole army corps set off and crossed Vouziers, leaving on the left bank of the Aisne only a brigade of the 2nd division, to continue monitoring the road to Monthois. Then, suddenly, on the other side of the town, on the right bank, we stopped, the beams were formed in the fields and in the meadows which extend to the two sides of the Grand-Pré road. And, at this moment, the departure of the 4th Hussars, moving away at a brisk trot by this road, gave rise to all sorts of conjectures.","But nobody knew anything and the most contradictory tales were going round. At one time they thought they were going on, camp was struck and the whole army corps began moving and went through Vouziers, leaving only one brigade of the second division on the left bank of the Aisne to keep an eye on the Monthois road. Then suddenly, at the other side of the town, on the right bank, they halted and piled arms in the fields and meadows stretching along on both sides of the Grand-Pré road. At that moment the departure of the 4th hussars, cantering away along that road, gave rise to all sorts of conjectures.","But no one seemed to know what were the plans for the day, and the most conflicting reports prevailed. It appeared for a moment as if they were about to resume their march; the tents were struck and the entire corps took the road and passed through Vouziers, leaving on the right bank of the Aisne only one brigade of the second division, apparently to continue the observation of the Monthois road; but all at once, as soon as they had put the town behind them and were on the left bank of the stream, they halted and stacked muskets in the fields and meadows that skirt the Grand-Pre road on either hand, and the departure of the 4th hussars, who just then moved off on that road at a sharp trot, afforded fresh food for conjecture."
"– Mon Dieu ! je ne sais pas, je vous jure que je ne sais pas moi-même… Mais, voyez-vous, ce serait si mal de mentir ! et je ne puis m’excuser, non ! je ne puis dire qu’il m’ait battue… Vous étiez parti, j’étais folle, et la chose est arrivée, je ne sais pas, je ne sais pas comment !","- My God ! I don't know, I swear to you that I don't know myself… But, you see, it would be so wrong to lie! and I can't apologize, no! I cannot say that he beat me... You were gone, I was mad, and the thing happened, I don't know, I don't know how!","‘Oh God, I don’t know, I swear I don’t even know myself… But you see, it would be wrong to tell a lie, and I can’t find excuses! No, I can’t say he used force… You had gone, I was out of my mind, and the thing happened, I don’t know, I don’t know how!’","“Mon Dieu! I do not know; I swear to you, I do not know, more than a babe unborn. I will not lie to you—I cannot! No, I have no excuse to offer; I cannot say he beat me. You had left me, I was beside myself, and it happened, how, I cannot, no, I cannot tell!”"
"Elle baissa encore la voix, continua avec un attendrissement où il y avait comme un petit rire :","She lowered her voice again, continued with tenderness in which there was a kind of little laugh:",She spoke more softly still and went on sentimentally but with a little giggle:,Her voice sank lower still; there was something that sounded very like a laugh of satisfaction in her tender tones.
"– Hein ? qu’est-ce que vous dites ?… Ces maisons qu’on aperçoit, au bout des champs ?",- Eh ? what are you saying?... Those houses that you can see at the end of the fields?,‘What’s that you’re saying?… Those houses you can see beyond the fields?’,"“Eh? What's that you say? Those houses that we see down there, at the end of the field?”"
"– C’est moi qui l’ai tué… Oui, là-bas, sur une barricade… Il se battait d’un côté, moi de l’autre…","– It was I who killed him… Yes, over there, on a barricade… He was fighting on one side, I on the other…","‘I’ve killed him… Yes, on a barricade somewhere… He was on one side and I was on the other.’","“It was I who killed him—yes, 'twas over yonder, behind a barricade, I did it. He was fighting on one side, I on the other—”"
"– Oui, la jambe seulement… Je n’ai pas même senti le coup, j’ai cru que je faisais un faux pas et que je tombais…","– Yes, the leg only… I didn’t even feel the blow, I thought I was taking a wrong step and falling…","‘Yes, only my leg… I didn’t even feel it happen, I thought I had stumbled and was falling…’","“Yes, it is only the leg."

"Lorsque le 106e quitta Boult-aux-Bois, à la suite de la cavalerie et de l’artillerie, dans le vaste ruissellement des trois divisions qui rayaient la plaine d’hommes en marche, le ciel de nouveau se couvrit, de lentes nuées livides, dont le deuil acheva d’attrister les soldats. Lui, suivait la grande route de Buzancy, bordée de peupliers magnifiques. À Germond, un village dont les tas de fumier, devant les portes, fumaient, alignés aux deux côtés du chemin, les femmes sanglotaient, prenaient leurs enfants, les tendaient aux troupes qui passaient, comme pour qu’on les emmenât. Il n’y avait plus là une bouchée de pain ni même une pomme de terre. Puis, au lieu de continuer vers Buzancy, le 106e tourna à gauche, remontant vers Authe ; et les hommes, en revoyant de l’autre côté de la plaine, sur le coteau, Belleville, qu’ils avaient traversée la veille, eurent alors la nette conscience qu’ils revenaient sur leurs pas.","When the 106th left Boult-aux-Bois, following the cavalry and the artillery, in the vast streaming of the three divisions which lined the plain of men on the march, the sky was again covered with slow, livid clouds. , whose mourning finished saddening the soldiers. He was following the main road to Buzancy, lined with magnificent poplars. At Germond, a village whose heaps of manure before the gates were smoking, lined up on either side of the road, the women were sobbing, taking their children, handing them to the passing troops, as if to be led away. There wasn't a morsel of bread there or even a potato. Then, instead of continuing towards Buzancy, the 106th turned left, going up towards Authe; and the men, seeing again on the other side of the plain, on the hillside, Belleville, which they had crossed the day before, then had the distinct consciousness that they were retracing their steps.","When the 106th followed its cavalry and artillery from Boult-aux-Bois in the great stream of three divisions streaking the plain with marching men, the sky clouded over again with slow-moving, angry clouds that put the finishing touch to the men’s gloom. The 106th itself kept to the main Buzancy road, with its magnificent lines of poplars. At Germont, a village with dunghills steaming outside the doors in a row on each side of the road, women were sobbing and picking up their children in their arms and holding them out to the passing troops as if they wanted them to be taken away. There was nothing left in the village – not a mouthful of bread or even a potato. Then instead of going on towards Buzancy the 106th turned to the left, going up in the direction of Authe, and the men, seeing Belleville once again on the rise at the other side of the plain, which they had been through the day before, knew for a certainty that they were retracing their steps.","When, in the outstreaming torrent of the three divisions that striped the plain with columns of marching men, the 106th left Boult-aux-Bois in the rear of the cavalry and artillery, the sky was again overspread with a pall of dull leaden clouds that further lowered the spirits of the soldiers. Its route was along the Buzancy highway, planted on either side with rows of magnificent poplars. When they reached Germond, a village where there was a steaming manure-heap before every one of the doors that lined the two sides of the straggling street, the sobbing women came to their thresholds with their little children in their arms, and held them out to the passing troops, as if begging the men to take them with them. There was not a mouthful of bread to be had in all the hamlet, nor even a potato, After that, the regiment, instead of keeping straight on toward Buzancy, turned to the left and made for Authe, and when the men turned their eyes across the plain and beheld upon the hilltop Belleville, through which they had passed the day before, the fact that they were retracing their steps was impressed more vividly on their consciousness."
"Il examina la blessure avec précaution, à la clarté vive des incendies. La baïonnette avait traversé le bras, près de l’épaule droite ; et le pis était qu’elle avait pénétré ensuite entre deux côtes, intéressant sans doute le poumon. Pourtant, le blessé respirait sans trop de difficulté. Son bras seul pendait, inerte.","He examined the wound carefully, in the bright light of the fires. The bayonet had passed through the arm, near the right shoulder; and the worst was that it had then penetrated between two ribs, undoubtedly involving the lung. However, the injured man was breathing without too much difficulty. His arm alone hung down, inert.","With very great care he examined the wound by the light from the fires. The bayonet had gone through the arm near the right shoulder, and the worst thing about it was that it had then penetrated between two ribs and probably involved the lung. Yet the wounded man was breathing without too much trouble. But the arm hung down, inert.","He examined the wound with great tenderness by the light of the burning buildings. The bayonet had gone through the right arm near the shoulder, but a more serious part of the business was that it had afterward entered the body between two of the ribs and probably touched the lung. Still, the wounded man breathed without much apparent difficulty, but the right arm hung useless at his side."
"– Ma pauvre Gilberte, dire qu’un obus peut tout allumer ici ! C’est effrayant.","“My poor Gilberte, to think that a shell can light everything here! It's scary.","‘Poor Gilberte, to think that one shell can set fire to all this! It’s terrifying.’","Then, touching his lips to his wife's hair: “My poor Gilberte, to think that a shell may burn us out of house and home at any moment! It is horrible.”"
"– Mais oui, je déjeune !… Donnez-moi des œufs, une côtelette, du fromage !… Et du vin blanc !","""Yes, yes, I am having breakfast!... Give me some eggs, a cutlet, some cheese!... And some white wine!""","‘Yes, rather! Give me some eggs, a cutlet and cheese… Oh, and some white wine!’","“Of course I will! Give me some eggs, a cutlet, and cheese. And a bottle of white wine!”"
"Il prit la peine d’aller chercher deux verres et une bouteille. Tout ce vin bu lui saignait le cœur, mais il fallait savoir offrir, dans les affaires. Et la scène de la soirée recommença, ils trinquèrent avec les mêmes gestes, les mêmes paroles.","He took the trouble to fetch two glasses and a bottle. All this drunk wine was bleeding his heart, but you had to know how to offer, in business. And the scene of the evening began again, they clinked glasses with the same gestures, the same words.","He put himself out to go and find two glasses and a bottle. All this wine being drunk made his heard bleed, but you must know when to give something away in the interests of business. So the scene of the night before began all over again, and they toasted each other with the same gestures and the same words.","He went himself and got a bottle and two glasses. Such expenditure of wine went to his heart, but one must know how to be liberal when he has business on hand. The scene of the preceding night was repeated, they touched glasses with the same words, the same gestures."
"Ses yeux de nouveau vacillèrent, il revoyait sa vie. Fils de petits épiciers de Lyon, gâté par sa mère qu’il avait perdue, n’ayant pu s’entendre avec son père, il était resté au régiment, dégoûté de tout, sans vouloir se laisser racheter ; et puis, pendant un congé, il s’était mis d’accord avec une de ses cousines, se reprenant à l’existence, faisant ensemble l’heureux projet de tenir un commerce, grâce aux quelques sous qu’elle devait apporter. Il avait de l’instruction, l’écriture, l’orthographe, le calcul. Depuis un an, il ne vivait plus que pour la joie de cet avenir.","His eyes flickered again, he saw his life again. The son of small grocers in Lyons, spoiled by his mother whom he had lost, having been unable to get along with his father, he had remained in the regiment, disgusted with everything, without wishing to allow himself to be redeemed; and then, during a holiday, he had come to terms with one of his cousins, getting back to life, making together the happy project of running a business, thanks to the few sous she was to bring. He had education, writing, spelling, arithmetic. For a year, he lived only for the joy of this future.","His eyes wandered off again and he saw his own life. Son of a small grocer in Lyons, spoilt by his mother who had died, and unable to get on with his father, he had stayed with the regiment, fed up with everything and refusing to be bought out. Then on one of his leaves he had come to an understanding with a girl cousin, come to terms with life, and together they had worked out an attractive project for opening a business, thanks to the small sum she would bring with her. He had had some schooling – reading, writing and arithmetic. For the past year he had lived only for the joy of this future life.","A vague expression came into his eyes again; his past life rose before him. He was the son of a small retail grocer at Lyons, and had been petted and spoiled by his mother up to the time of her death; then rejecting the proffer of his father, with whom he did not hit it off well, to assist in purchasing his discharge, he had remained with the army, weary and disgusted with life and with his surroundings. Coming home on furlough, however, he fell in love with a cousin and they became engaged; their intention was to open a little shop on the small capital which she would bring him, and then existence once more became desirable. He had received an elementary education; could read, write, and cipher. For the past year he had lived only in anticipation of this happy future."
"– Tiens ! est-ce drôle, murmura-t-il, j’ai dormi !… Ah ! ça m’a fait du bien.","- Take ! is it funny, he murmured, I slept!... Ah! It did me good.","‘Fancy, isn’t that funny, I’ve been asleep! Oh, it’s done me good.’",“Hallo! that's funny; I must have been asleep!” he murmured. “Ah! it has done me good.”
"– Es-tu bête, je vais faire relâcher ton oncle avant trois jours !… On ne t’a donc pas dit que j’ai ici, dans la maison, un capitaine prussien qui fait tout ce que je veux ?… Tu entends, ma chère, il n’a rien à me refuser !","""Are you stupid, I'm going to have your uncle released within three days!...

"Mais une fusillade éclata, dans le bas de Floing, tout de suite éteinte du reste, et la compagnie du capitaine Beaudoin reçut l’ordre de se reporter de trois cents mètres en arrière. On arrivait dans un vaste carré de choux, lorsque le capitaine cria, de sa voix brève :","But a fusillade broke out in the lower part of Floing, which was immediately extinguished, and Captain Beaudoin's company was ordered to fall back three hundred yards. They were arriving in a vast patch of cabbage when the captain cried out in his curt voice:","A fusillade burst out at the lower end of Floing, but was over almost at once, and Captain Beaudoin’s company was ordered to fall back three hundred metres. They were entering a huge square cabbage-field when the captain snapped out:","Then a sharp rattle of musketry, quickly silenced, however, was heard proceeding from a point beneath Floing, and Captain Beaudoin received orders to move his company three hundred yards to the rear. Their new position was in a great field of cabbages, upon reaching which the captain made his men lie down."
"Mais, comme il allait être neuf heures, une agitation se propagea, des officiers coururent, et le lieutenant Rochas, à qui le capitaine Beaudoin avait donné un ordre, passa devant les tentes de sa section.","But, as it was about nine o'clock, a commotion spread, officers ran, and Lieutenant Rochas, to whom Captain Beaudoin had given an order, passed in front of the tents of his section.","But just before nine there was a sensation in the air, officers rushed about, and Lieutenant Rochas, who had an order from Captain Beaudoin, came past the tents of his section.","But just as the clocks were on the point of striking nine a commotion arose and spread among the men; officers came running up, and Lieutenant Rochas, to whom Captain Beaudoin had come and communicated an order, passed along in front of the tents of his platoon and gave the command:"
"Madame Delaherche se hâta, revint suivie de trois servantes, les bras chargés de toutes les terrines qu’elle avait pu trouver. Debout devant les trousses, Gilberte avait appelé Henriette d’un signe, en les lui montrant avec un léger frisson. Toutes deux se prirent la main, restèrent là, silencieuses, mettant dans leur étreinte la sourde terreur, la pitié anxieuse qui les bouleversaient.","Madame Delaherche hurried back, followed by three servants, their arms laden with all the terrines she could find. Standing in front of the pencil cases, Gilberte had called Henriette with a sign, showing them to her with a slight shudder. The two took each other's hand, remained there, silent, putting in their embrace the dull terror, the anxious pity which upset them.","Madame Delaherche rushed off and came back followed by three maids loaded with all the bowls they could find. Standing by the instruments Gilberte had beckoned Henriette over and shown them to her with a little shudder. They held each other’s hands and stood there in silence, expressing with the pressure of their hands the vague terror, pity and anxiety overwhelming them.","Madame Delaherche hurried away and returned, followed by three women bearing a supply of the desired vessels. Gilberte, standing by the table where the instruments were laid out, summoned Henriette to her side by a look and pointed to them with a little shudder.

"Mais il ne se pressait pas, conduisait à l’écurie les chevaux fumants, donnait surtout au sien un coup d’œil paternel. L’amour du cheval, pris sans doute dès l’enfance, quand il menait les bêtes au labour, lui avait fait choisir la cavalerie.","But he was in no hurry, led the smoking horses to the stables, and above all gave his own a paternal look. The love of the horse, doubtless taken from childhood, when he led the animals to plough, had made him choose the cavalry.","But he was in no hurry and led the steaming horses round to the stable, giving a fatherly look, especially at his own. Love of horses, acquired no doubt in childhood when he led the animals to the plough, had made him choose the cavalry.","He took things very easily, however, conducting the steaming horses to the stable, and to his own, more particularly, giving a paternal attention. It was no doubt his affection for the noble animal, contracted when he was a boy and rode him to the plow, that had made him select the cavalry arm of the service."
"– On va en faire un drapeau blanc, qu’on hissera sur la citadelle, pour demander la paix… Merci bien, mademoiselle.","– We will make a white flag of it, which we will hoist on the citadel, to ask for peace… Thank you very much, miss.","‘We’re going to make it into a white flag that will be put up over the citadel to ask for peace… Thanks very much, Mademoiselle.’","And he added as he left the room: “It is to be used as a flag of truce, and hoisted on the citadel to let the enemy know we want to stop the fighting.

"Il lui désignait un gros caillou blanc, à leurs pieds. Lapoulle, interloqué, finit par le prendre et par le retourner entre ses doigts.","He pointed to a big white pebble at their feet.

"Jean, sans se mêler de la querelle, trouva au fond qu’il avait raison.

C’était sûr, puisqu’on n’était venu que pour ça.","Jean, without getting involved in the quarrel, found at bottom that he was right. He too, while beginning to be astonished at the long delays and the disorder in which we were, had never doubted the formidable beating that was going to be extended to the Prussians.

"À la Sous-Préfecture, Delaherche ne trouva pas Rose dans la loge du concierge. Toutes les portes étaient ouvertes, la déroute commençait. Alors, il monta, ne se heurtant que dans des gens effarés, sans que personne lui adressât la moindre question. Au premier étage, comme il hésitait, il rencontra la jeune fille.","At the Sub-Prefecture, Delaherche did not find Rose in the concierge's lodge. All the doors were open, the rout was beginning. So he went upstairs, only bumping into frightened people, without anyone asking him the slightest question. On the first floor, as he hesitated, he met the young girl.","Delaherche did not find Rose in the porter’s lodge at the Sub-Prefecture. Every door was open and the rout was setting in. So he went up the stairs, every person he ran into was in a panic and nobody asked him any questions. As he was hesitating on the first floor he saw the girl.","At the Sous-Prefecture Delaherche failed to find Rose at her usual station in the janitor's lodge. Everywhere were evidences of disorder; all the doors were standing open; the reign of terror had commenced. As there was no sentry or anyone to prevent, he went upstairs, encountering on the way only a few scared-looking men, none of whom made any offer to stop him. He had reached the first story and was hesitating what to do next when he saw the young girl approaching him."
"Maurice ne put lui répondre, hésitant. D’après ce qu’il avait lu à Reims, il lui semblait difficile que la troisième armée, commandée par le prince royal de Prusse, fût à Vouziers, lorsque, l’avant-veille encore, elle devait camper à peine du côté de Vitry-le-François. On avait bien parlé d’une quatrième armée, mise sous les ordres du prince de Saxe, qui allait opérer sur la Meuse : c’était celle-ci sans doute, quoique l’occupation si prompte de Grand-Pré l’étonnât, à cause des distances. Mais ce qui acheva de brouiller ses idées, ce fut sa stupeur d’entendre le général Bourgain-Desfeuilles questionner un paysan de Falaise pour savoir si la Meuse ne passait pas à Buzancy et s’il n’y avait pas là des ponts solides. D’ailleurs, dans la sérénité de son ignorance, le général déclarait qu’on allait être attaqué par une colonne de cent mille hommes venant de Grand-Pré, tandis qu’une autre de soixante mille arrivait par Sainte-Menehould.","Maurice could not answer him, hesitating. According to what he had read at Reims, it seemed to him difficult for the Third Army, commanded by the Prince Royal of Prussia, to be at Vouziers, when, two days before, it was hardly to encamp on the side of Vitry-le-Francois. There had been talk of a fourth army, placed under the orders of the Prince of Saxony, which was going to operate on the Meuse: it was this one, no doubt, although the so prompt occupation of Grand-Pré surprised him, to due to distance. But what completely confused his ideas was his amazement at hearing General Bourgain-Desfeuilles question a peasant from Falaise to find out if the Meuse did not pass through Buzancy and if there were not solid bridges there. Moreover, in the serenity of his ignorance, the general declared that they were going to be attacked by a column of a hundred thousand men coming from Grand-Pré, while another of sixty thousand was arriving by Sainte-Menehould.","Maurice could not answer him, for he wasn’t sure. From what he had read at Rheims it seemed very unlikely that the IIIrd army, commanded by the Prussian Crown Prince, could be at Vouziers when only two days before it could scarcely have camped nearer than Vitry-le-François. There had of course been talk of a IVth army put under the command of the Crown Prince of Saxony which was to operate on the Meuse; it must be that one, although such an early occupation of Grand-Pré astonished him because of the distances. But what finally muddled him was his amazement when he heard General Bourgain-Desfeuilles interrogating a peasant from Falaise to find out whether or not the Meuse flowed through Buzancy and if there were some strong bridges there. Moreover in his fool’s paradise the general declared that they would be attacked by a force of a hundred thousand men from Grand-Pré whilst another sixty thousand were coming via Sainte-Ménehould.","Maurice could not answer his question with any degree of certainty. It seemed to him hardly probable, in view of what he had read in the newspapers at Rheims, that the third army, commanded by the Crown Prince of Prussia, could be at Vouziers, when, only two days before, it was just on the point of going into camp at Vitry-le-Francois. There had been some talk of a fourth army, under the Prince of Saxony, which was to operate on the line of the Meuse; this was doubtless the one that was now before them, although their promptitude in occupying Grand-Pre was a matter of surprise, considering the distances. But what put the finishing touch to the confusion of his ideas was his stupefaction to hear General Bourgain-Desfeuilles ask a countryman if the Meuse did not flow past Buzancy, and if the bridges there were strong. The general announced, moreover, in the confidence of his sublime ignorance, that a column of one hundred thousand men was on the way from Grand-Pre to attack them, while another, of sixty thousand, was coming up by the way of Sainte-Menehould."
"Et, ayant serré une dernière fois les deux mains de Weiss, il fila à grandes enjambées vers le monticule où était parquée l’artillerie de réserve, sans avoir reparlé de son père, sans rien avoir fait dire à Silvine, dont le nom lui brûlait les lèvres.","And, having shook Weiss's two hands one last time, he sped off with great strides towards the mound where the reserve artillery was parked, without having spoken of his father again, without having said anything to Silvine, whose name burned to him. the lips.","He gave a final squeeze to both Weiss’s hands and strode rapidly towards the hillock on which the reserve artillery was parked, without another word about his father or message for Silvine, whose name burned his throat. A few more minutes went by and over to the left, where the second brigade would be, a bugle sounded roll-call.","And grasping Weiss by both his hands and giving them a hearty squeeze, he strode swiftly away toward the slight elevation where the guns of the reserves were parked, without again mentioning his father's name or sending any word to Silvine, whose name lay at the end of his tongue. The minutes slipped away, and over toward the left, where the 2d brigade lay, a bugle sounded."

"Maurice, qui ne voulait pas parler, ne put réprimer un sourire ; tandis que Jean, gêné par cette conversation sur la politique, craignant de dire des sottises, se contenta de répondre :","Maurice, who did not want to speak, could not repress a smile; while Jean, embarrassed by this conversation on politics, afraid of saying nonsense, contented himself with replying:","Maurice did not want to be drawn in, but could not repress a smile, while Jean, embarrassed by this political talk and afraid of saying something silly, merely said:","Maurice, who preferred to say nothing on the subject, could not help smiling, while Jean, embarrassed by the political turn the conversation had taken and fearful lest he might make some ill-timed remark, simply replied:"

"La barque, en effet, semblait portée par un fleuve de braise. Sous les reflets dansants de ces foyers immenses, on aurait cru que la Seine roulait des charbons ardents. De brusques éclairs rouges y couraient, dans un grand froissement de tisons jaunes. Et ils descendaient toujours lentement, au fil de cette eau incendiée, entre les palais en flammes, ainsi que dans une rue démesurée de ville maudite, brûlant aux deux bords d’une chaussée de lave en fusion.","The boat, in fact, seemed carried by a river of embers. Under the dancing reflections of these immense hearths, one would have believed that the Seine was rolling hot coals. Sudden flashes of red flashed through it, in a great rustle of yellow embers. And they were still descending slowly, along this burning water, between the palaces in flames, as in an immense street of a cursed city, burning at the two edges of a causeway of molten lava.","And indeed the boat seemed to be floating on a river of fire. In the dancing reflections of these huge conflagrations the Seine appeared to be bearing along blazing coals. Sudden red flashes played over it in shimmering patches of flame. And they were still floating downstream on this burning water, between these palaces in flames, as if in an endless street in an accursed city, burning on each side of a roadway of molten lava.","Their boat seemed to be sailing on the bosom of an incandescent stream. As the dancing lights of the mighty conflagrations were caught by the ripples of the current the Seine seemed to be pouring down torrents of living coals; flashes of intensest crimson played fitfully across its surface, the blazing brands fell in showers into the water and were extinguished with a hiss. And ever they floated downward with the tide on the bosom of that blood-red stream, between the blazing palaces on either hand, like wayfarers in some accursed city, doomed to destruction and burning on the banks of a river of molten lava."

"Prosper le remerciait et s’éloignait pour rejoindre Silvine, lorsqu’il aperçut un chassepot à moitié enterré dans un sillon. D’abord, il se garda bien de l’indiquer. Et, brusquement, il revint, il cria comme malgré lui :","Prosper was thanking him and walking away to join Silvine, when he saw a Chassepot half buried in a furrow. At first, he was careful not to mention it. And suddenly he came back, he cried as if in spite of himself:",Prosper thanked him and was moving off to go back to Silvine when he caught sight of a rifle half buried in a furrow. At first he took care not to point it out. But then he suddenly turned back and found himself calling:,"Prosper thanked him and was moving away to rejoin Silvine when he caught sight of a chassepot, partially buried in a furrow. His first thought was to say nothing of his discovery; then he turned about suddenly and shouted, as if he could not help it:"
"Quant au lieutenant Rochas, galopé également d’une terrible fringale, il tournait, avec un rire de brave homme, autour de la bienheureuse escouade. Lui, ses hommes l’adoraient, d’abord parce qu’il exécrait le capitaine, ce freluquet sorti de Saint-Cyr, et ensuite parce qu’il avait porté le sac, comme eux tous. Il n’était pas toujours commode pourtant, d’une grossièreté parfois à lui ficher des gifles.","As for Lieutenant Rochas, also galloping with a terrible craving, he circled, with the laughter of a worthy man, around the happy squad. Him, his men adored him, firstly because he hated the captain, this freluquet from Saint-Cyr, and then because he had carried the bag, like all of them. He was not always easy, however, sometimes rude enough to slap her.","But as for Lieutenant Rochas, his guts were just as tormented with terrible hunger, and he was prowling round the blissful squad openly laughing. He was worshipped by the men, first because he loathed the captain for being a puppy from Saint-Cyr, and also because he himself had shouldered the knapsack the same as the rest of them. Not that he was always as easy-going as that, being so rude sometimes that you could punch his head.","As for Lieutenant Rochas, who was also conscious of a terribly empty sensation in his epigastric region, he put on a brave face and laughed good-naturedly as he passed the thrice-lucky squad. His men adored him, in the first place because he was at sword's points with the captain, that little whipper-snapper from Saint-Cyr, and also because he had once carried a musket like themselves. He was not always easy to get along with, however, and there were times when they would have given a good deal could they have cuffed him for his brutality."
"Cette peine semblait augmenter encore la douleur grandissante qui lui tordait l’estomac. La bête, en lui, se révoltait : il était à bout de force, il se mourait de faim. Sa vue se troublait, il n’avait même plus conscience du danger où se trouvait le régiment, depuis que la batterie avait dû se replier. D’une minute à l’autre, des masses considérables pouvaient attaquer le plateau.","This pain seemed to further increase the growing pain that twisted his stomach. The beast within him revolted: he was exhausted, he was dying of hunger. His vision was blurred, he was no longer even aware of the danger in which the regiment found itself, since the battery had had to fall back. From one minute to the next, considerable masses could attack the plateau.","This sorrow seemed to make his gut-twisting pain worse than ever. The animal within him was in revolt, he was at the end of his tether and he was dying of hunger. His eyes were worrying him, and he did not even realize the danger the regiment was now in since the battery had had to retire. At any minute the plateau could be attacked by heavy forces.","In addition to this feeling of mental distress he had a horrible sensation of physical suffering, as if something was gnawing at his vitals. It was the animal portion of his nature asserting itself; he was at the end of his endurance, was ready to sink with hunger. His perceptions were dimmed, he was not even conscious of the dangerous position the regiment was in now it no longer was protected by the battery. It was more than likely that the enemy would not long delay to attack the plateau in force."
"Jean eut un frémissement, d’esprit plus net et plus froid, malgré la révolte qui finissait par le faire rêver aussi d’évasion.","Jean shuddered, his mind clearer and colder, in spite of the revolt which ended up making him also dream of escape.","Jean, whose mind was cooler and clearer, recoiled at the idea in spite of the feeling of revolt that was making him, too, think about escape.","Jean, accustomed as he was to look at things coolly and calculate chances, put his veto on the mad scheme, although he, too, in his revolt, was beginning to meditate the possibilities of an escape."
"Ce fut sûrement à cette heure de la journée que le canon tonna le plus fort. Il était trois heures, et Delaherche, désappointé, exaspéré, déclarait n’y plus rien comprendre. Maintenant, il devenait hors de doute que, loin de se taire, les batteries prussiennes redoublaient leur feu. Pourquoi ? que se passait-il ? C’était un bombardement d’enfer, le sol tremblait, l’air s’embrasait. Autour de Sedan, la ceinture de bronze, les huit cents pièces des armées allemandes tiraient à la fois, foudroyaient les champs voisins d’un tonnerre continu ; et ce feu convergent, toutes les hauteurs environnantes frappant au centre, aurait brûlé et pulvérisé la ville en deux heures. Le pis était que des obus recommençaient à tomber sur les maisons. Des fracas plus fréquents retentissaient. Il en éclata un rue des Voyards. Un autre écorna une cheminée haute de la fabrique, et des gravats dégringolèrent devant le hangar.","It was surely at this hour of the day that the cannon thundered the loudest. It was three o'clock, and Delaherche, disappointed, exasperated, declared that he no longer understood anything. Now it became beyond doubt that, far from being silent, the Prussian batteries were redoubled their fire. Why ? what was happening ? It was a bombardment from hell, the ground was shaking, the air was on fire. Around Sedan, the belt of bronze, the eight hundred guns of the German armies fired at once, thundering down the neighboring fields with continuous thunder; and this converging fire, all the surrounding heights striking in the center, would have burned and pulverized the city in two hours. The worst was that shells started to fall on the houses again. More frequent crashes sounded. One broke out in the Rue des Voyards. Another dented a tall chimney in the factory, and rubble tumbled down in front of the shed.","It was certainly at this hour of the day that the thunder of the guns was at its worst. It was now three, and Delaherche, feeling let down and exasperated, declared that it was beyond his comprehension. For now there was no doubt about it that, far from stopping, the Prussian batteries were redoubling their fire. Why? What was going on? It was a hellish bombardment, the ground shook and the very air was on fire. All round Sedan the eight hundred pieces of German equipment, a girdle of bronze, were firing at once, blasting the fields with a continuous thunder, and this converging fire, all these surrounding heights aiming at the centre, would burn and pulverize the town within two hours. The worst of it was that shells were beginning to come down on houses again. More and more crashes could be heard. One shell went off in the rue des Voyards. Another knocked a bit off one of the tall chimneys of the mill and rubble came down outside the shed.","At no time during the day had the artillery thundered more loudly than now. It was three o'clock, and Delaherche declared angrily that he gave it up —he could not understand it. There could be no doubt about it now, the Prussian batteries, instead of slackening their fire, were extending it. Why? What had happened? It was as if all the forces of the nether regions had been unchained; the earth shook, the heavens were on fire. The ring of flame-belching mouths of bronze that encircled Sedan, the eight hundred guns of the German armies, that were served with such activity and raised such an uproar, were expending their thunders on the adjacent fields; had that concentric fire been focused upon the city, had the batteries on those commanding heights once begun to play upon Sedan , it would have been reduced to ashes and pulverized into dust in less than fifteen minutes. But now the projectiles were again commencing to fall upon the houses, the crash that told of ruin and destruction was heard more frequently. One exploded in the Rue des Voyards, another grazed the tall chimney of the factory, and the bricks and mortar came tumbling to the ground directly in front of the shed where the surgeons were at work."

"Tout de suite, Henriette régla les choses : il fut entendu que, pour éviter les soupçons, elle seule et le docteur pénétreraient auprès de Jean. Jamais Silvine ne devait entrer, sans qu’elle l’appelât. De grand matin, le ménage était fait par les deux femmes ; puis, la journée entière, la porte restait comme murée. La nuit, si le blessé avait eu besoin de quelqu’un, il n’aurait eu qu’à taper au mur, car la pièce occupée par Henriette était voisine. Et ce fut ainsi que Jean se trouva brusquement séparé du monde, après des semaines de cohue violente, ne voyant plus que cette jeune femme si douce, dont le pas léger ne faisait aucun bruit. Il la revoyait telle qu’il l’avait vue, là-bas, à Sedan, pour la première fois, pareille à une apparition, avec sa bouche un peu grande, ses traits menus, ses beaux cheveux d’avoine mûre, s’occupant de lui d’un air d’infinie bonté.","Henriette settled things straight away: it was agreed that, to avoid suspicion, she alone and the doctor should enter Jean's room. Silvine was never to come in without her calling him. Early in the morning, the cleaning was done by the two women; then, the whole day, the door remained as if walled up. At night, if the injured man had needed someone, he would have only had to knock on the wall, because the room occupied by Henriette was nearby. And so it was that Jean suddenly found himself separated from the world, after weeks of violent crush, seeing only this gentle young woman, whose light step made no sound. He saw her again as he had seen her, over there, in Sedan, for the first time, like an apparition, with her rather large mouth, her slender features, her beautiful ripe oatmeal hair, taking care of him with an air of infinite kindness.","Henriette quickly settled the routine: it was understood that to avoid suspicion only she and the doctor would go in and see Jean. Silvine was never to go in unless she was asked to. First thing in the morning the two women tidied up, and then all day long the door might have been walled up. If the patient needed something in the night he would only have to knock on the wall, for Henriette’s room was adjoining. And so, after weeks of living in a turbulent mob, Jean suddenly found himself cut off from the world, seeing nobody but this young woman who was so gentle that her light step made no sound. He saw her again just as he had seen her for the first time in Sedan, like a vision, with her rather wide mouth, small, neat features and beautiful hair the colour of ripe grain, looking after him with infinite kindness.","As it was to be her kingdom, Henriette constituted herself lawmaker from the beginning. The regulation was that no one save she and the doctor should have access to Jean; this in order to avert suspicion. Silvine, even, was never to set foot in the room unless by direction. Early each morning the two women came in and put things to rights, and after that, all the long day, the door was as impenetrable as if it had been a wall of stone. And thus it was that Jean found himself suddenly secluded from the world, after many weeks of tumultuous activity, seeing no face save that of the gentle woman whose footfall on the floor gave back no sound. She appeared to him, as he had beheld her for the first time down yonder in Sedan, like an apparition, with her somewhat large mouth, her delicate, small features, her hair the hue of ripened grain, hovering about his bedside and ministering to his wants with an air of infinite goodness."
"Depuis qu’il l’avait revue, si changée, si éperdue de détresse, il la regardait d’un cœur crevé de pitié, en se la rappelant telle qu’elle lui était apparue, la veille, avec son sourire de bonne ménagère. D’abord, il n’avait rien trouvé à lui dire, ne sachant même pas si elle le reconnaissait. Il aurait voulu se dévouer pour elle, lui rendre de la tranquillité et de la joie.","Ever since he had seen her again, so changed, so distraught with distress, he had looked at her with a heart broken with pity, remembering her as she had appeared to him the day before, with her good housewife's smile. At first, he had found nothing to say to her, not even knowing if she recognized him. He would have liked to devote himself to her, restore her peace and joy.","Now that he had seen her again, looking so changed and overcome with distress, his heart was bursting with pity as he remembered how she had struck him only the day before, a smiling housewife. At first he had not found anything to say to her, not knowing even whether she recognized him. He would have liked to devote himself to her and bring back into her life some peace and joy.","His heart overflowed with pity as he beheld the change her terrible affliction had wrought in her, and he recalled her image as she had appeared to him only the day before, her face bright with the kindly smile of the happy, loving wife. At first he had found no word to say to her, hardly knowing even if she would recognize him. He felt that he could gladly give his life, if that would serve to restore her peace of mind."
"Weiss était accouru à Mulhouse, à la veille des premières hostilités, dans le brusque désir d’y régler une affaire de famille ; et, s’il s’était servi, pour serrer la main de son beau-frère, du bon vouloir du colonel de Vineuil, c’était que ce dernier se trouvait être l’oncle de la jeune Madame Delaherche, une jolie veuve épousée l’année d’auparavant par le fabricant de drap, et que Maurice et Henriette avaient connue gamine, grâce à un hasard de voisinage. D’ailleurs, outre le colonel, Maurice venait de retrouver dans le capitaine de sa compagnie, le capitaine Beaudoin, une connaissance de Gilberte, la jeune Madame Delaherche, un ami à elle, intime, disait-on, lorsqu’elle était à Mézières Madame Maginot, femme de M. Maginot, inspecteur des forêts.","Weiss had rushed to Mulhouse, on the eve of the first hostilities, in the sudden desire to settle a family business there; and if he had used Colonel de Vineuil's goodwill to shake his brother-in-law's hand, it was because the latter happened to be the uncle of young Madame Delaherche, a pretty widow married the year before by the cloth manufacturer, and whom Maurice and Henriette had known as a child, thanks to a chance neighborhood. Moreover, besides the colonel, Maurice had just found in the captain of his company, Captain Beaudoin, an acquaintance of Gilberte, the young Madame Delaherche, a friend of hers, intimate, it was said, when she was in Mézières. Madame Maginot, wife of M. Maginot, forest inspector.","Weiss had hurried to Mulhouse the day before the outbreak of hostilities, suddenly anxious to settle a family affair, and the reason why he had taken advantage of Colonel de Vineuil’s kindness and come to give his brother-in-law a handshake was that the colonel was uncle of young Madame Delaherche, a pretty widow married last year to the manufacturer. Maurice and Henriette had known her as a young girl through having been neighbours. Also, apart from the colonel, Maurice had found in Captain Beaudoin, the captain of his company, an acquaintance of Gilberte, young Madame Delaherche, and an intimate one, it was said, dating from Mézières when she was Madame Maginot, wife of Monsieur Maginot, Inspector of Forests.","Weiss, on the eve of the commencement of hostilities, had found that there were family matters that made it necessary for him to visit Mulhausen, and had made a hurried trip to that city. That he had been able to employ the good offices of Colonel de Vineuil to afford him an opportunity of shaking hands with his brother-in-law was owing to the circumstance that that officer was own uncle to young Mme. Delaherche, a pretty young widow whom the cloth manufacturer had married the year previous, and whom Maurice and Henriette, thanks to their being neighbors, had known as a girl. In addition to the colonel, moreover, Maurice had discovered that the captain of his company, Beaudoin, was an acquaintance of Gilberte, Delaherche's young wife; report even had it that she and the captain had been on terms of intimacy in the days when she was Mme. Maginot, living at Meziere, wife of M. Maginot, the timber inspector."

"La nuit était complètement venue depuis longtemps, et Rochas continuait d’agiter ses grands membres dans les ténèbres.

And he couldn't calm down, and all his science came out in a rushing cry.","For a long time now it had been quite dark, and still Rochas was waving his great limbs about in the night. He had only ever managed to read through one book, the victories of Napoleon, which had found its way from a pedlar’s box into his knapsack. He was thoroughly wound up now, and all his learning gushed forth in one impetuous cry:","It was quite dark by this time, and Rochas continued to gesticulate and brandish his long arms in the obscurity. His historical studies had been confined to a stray volume of Napoleonic memoirs that had found its way to his knapsack from a peddler's wagon. His excitement refused to be pacified and all his book-learning burst from his lips in a torrent of eloquence:"
– Lapoulle ! répéta très haut le sergent.,- Lapoulle! repeated the sergeant very loudly.,"‘Lapoulle!’ repeated the sergeant, very loud.","“Lapoulle!” shouted the sergeant, calling the name a second time with increased emphasis."
"De sa main tremblante, il indiquait l’horizon immense, le Hattoy, les plateaux de Floing et d’Illy, le bois de la Garenne, ces champs exécrables du massacre et de la défaite.","With his trembling hand he pointed out the immense horizon, the Hattoy, the plateaus of Floing and Illy, the Bois de la Garenne, those execrable fields of massacre and defeat.","With a trembling hand he pointed at the immense horizon, Le Hattoy, the plateaux of Floing and Illy, the Garenne woods, all these hateful scenes of massacre and defeat.","I should be ill if I were to have that scene before my eyes for any length of time—” With a hand that trembled he pointed to the remote horizon, the hill of Hattoy, the plateaux of Floing and Illy, the wood of la Garenne, those abhorred, detested fields of slaughter and defeat."

"À bout de force, tombée sur une chaise, elle raconta que, lorsque le 7e corps avait envahi Raucourt, elle s’était réfugiée chez son parrain, le docteur Dalichamp, espérant que le père Fouchard aurait l’idée de venir l’y prendre, avant de repartir. La Grande-Rue était encombrée d’une telle bousculade, qu’un chien ne s’y serait pas risqué. Et, jusque vers quatre heures, elle avait patienté, assez tranquille, faisant de la charpie avec des dames ; car le docteur, dans la pensée qu’on enverrait peut-être des blessés de Metz et de Verdun, si l’on se battait par là, s’occupait depuis quinze jours à installer une ambulance dans la grande salle de la mairie. Du monde arrivait, qui disait qu’on pourrait bien se servir tout de suite de cette ambulance ; et, en effet, dès midi, on avait entendu le canon, du côté de Beaumont. Mais ça se passait loin encore, on n’avait pas peur, lorsque, tout d’un coup, comme les derniers soldats français quittaient Raucourt, un obus était venu, avec un bruit effroyable, défoncer le toit d’une maison voisine. Deux autres suivirent, c’était une batterie allemande qui canonnait l’arrière-garde du 7e corps. Déjà, des blessés de Beaumont se trouvaient à la mairie, on craignit qu’un obus ne les achevât sur la paille, où ils attendaient que le docteur vînt les opérer. Fous d’épouvante, les blessés se levaient, voulaient descendre dans les caves, malgré leurs membres fracassés, qui leur arrachaient des cris de douleur.","Exhausted, fallen on a chair, she said that when the 7th corps had invaded Raucourt, she had taken refuge with her godfather, Doctor Dalichamp, hoping that Father Fouchard would have the idea to come and take her there. , before leaving. The Grande-Rue was encumbered with such a rush that a dog would not have ventured there. And, until about four o'clock, she had been patient, rather quiet, making lint with the ladies; for the doctor, thinking that they might perhaps send wounded from Metz and Verdun if they fought that way, had been occupied for a fortnight in setting up an ambulance in the great hall of the town hall. People arrived, saying that we could make use of this ambulance right away; and, in fact, from noon the cannon had been heard from the Beaumont side. But it was still far away, we were not afraid, when suddenly, as the last French soldiers were leaving Raucourt, a shell had come, with a terrible noise, to smash the roof of a neighboring house. Two others followed, it was a German battery which cannonaded the rearguard of the 7th corps. Already, the wounded of Beaumont were at the town hall, it was feared that a shell would finish them on the straw, where they were waiting for the doctor to come and operate on them. Mad with terror, the wounded got up, wanted to go down into the cellars, in spite of their shattered limbs, which tore from them cries of pain.","She sank on to a chair, exhausted and then told them her story; that when the 7th corps had overrun Raucourt she had fled to the house of her godfather, Dr Dalichamp, hoping that old Fouchard would think of going there for her before he went home. The main street was jammed with such a crush of people that even a dog would not have ventured along it. She had waited patiently until about four, not too worried, making bandages with some ladies for the doctor who, thinking that they might perhaps send some wounded from Metz and Verdun if there was any fighting round there, had been busy for a fortnight fixing up a casualty station in the big room at the town hall. Some people had come and said that the station might be needed at once, and in fact by noon they had heard gunfire in the direction of Beaumont. But that was still a long way off and nobody was worried; and then all of a sudden, just as the last French soldiers were leaving Raucourt, a shell came down with a terrific noise and smashed in the roof of a house quite near. Two more followed; it was a German battery shelling the rearguard of the 7th. There were already some wounded from Beaumont at the town hall and it was feared that a shell might finish them off as they lay on straw mattresses waiting for the doctor to deal with them. Mad with terror, the wounded men got up and tried to go down into the cellars in spite of their smashed limbs which were making them scream with pain.","Sinking wearily upon a chair she told how, when the 7th corps came into Raucourt, she had fled for shelter to the house of her godfather, Doctor Dalichamp, hoping that Father Fouchard would think to come and take her up before he left the town. The main street was filled with a surging throng, so dense that not even a dog could have squeezed his way through it, and up to four o'clock she had felt no particular alarm, tranquilly employed in scraping lint in company with some of the ladies of the place; for the doctor, with the thought that they might be called on to care for some of the wounded, should there be a battle over in the direction of Metz and Verdun, had been busying himself for the last two weeks with improvising a hospital in the great hall of the mairie. Some people who dropped in remarked that they might find use for their hospital sooner than they expected, and sure enough, a little after midday, the roar of artillery had reached their ears from over Beaumont way. But that was not near enough to cause anxiety and no one was alarmed, when, all at once, just as the last of the French troops were filing out of Raucourt, a shell, with a frightful crash, came tearing through the roof of a neighboring house. Two others followed in quick succession; it was a German battery shelling the rear-guard of the 7th corps. Some of the wounded from Beaumont had already been brought in to the mairie, where it was feared that the enemy's projectiles would finish them as they lay on their mattresses waiting for the doctor to come and operate on them. The men were crazed with fear, and would have risen and gone down into the cellars, notwithstanding their mangled limbs, which extorted from them shrieks of agony."

"Maurice, alors, qui n’avait jamais bu, se trouva pris et comme noyé, dans le coup d’ivresse générale. Il lui arrivait, maintenant, lorsqu’il était de service à quelque poste avancé, ou bien lorsqu’il passait la nuit au corps de garde, d’accepter un petit verre de cognac. S’il en prenait un second, il s’exaltait, parmi les souffles d’alcool qui lui passaient sur la face. C’était l’épidémie envahissante, la soûlerie chronique, léguée par le premier siège, aggravée par le second, cette population sans pain, ayant de l’eau-de-vie et du vin à pleins tonneaux, et qui s’était saturée, délirante désormais à la moindre goutte. Pour la première fois de sa vie, le 21 mai, un dimanche, Maurice rentra ivre, vers le soir, rue des Orties, où il couchait de temps à autre. Il avait passé la journée à Neuilly encore, faisant le coup de feu, buvant avec les camarades, dans l’espoir de combattre l’immense fatigue qui l’accablait. Puis, la tête perdue, à bout de force, il était venu se jeter sur le lit de sa petite chambre, ramené par l’instinct, car jamais il ne se rappela comment il était rentré. Et, le lendemain seulement, le soleil était déjà haut, lorsque des bruits de tocsins, de tambours et de clairons le réveillèrent. La veille, au Point-du-Jour, les Versaillais, trouvant une porte abandonnée, étaient entrés librement dans Paris.","Maurice, then, who had never drunk, found himself caught and as if drowned in the general drunkenness. It happened to him now, when he was on duty at some outpost, or when he was spending the night at the guardhouse, to accept a little glass of cognac. If he took a second, he was elated among the breaths of alcohol that passed over his face. It was the invading epidemic, the chronic drunkenness, bequeathed by the first siege, aggravated by the second, this population without bread, having brandy and wine at full barrels, and which had become saturated , now delirious at the slightest drop. For the first time in his life, on May 21, a Sunday, Maurice came home drunk towards evening, rue des Orties, where he slept from time to time. He had spent the day again in Neuilly, firing the shot, drinking with his comrades, in the hope of overcoming the immense fatigue which overwhelmed him. Then, his head lost, exhausted, he came and threw himself on the bed of his little room, brought back by instinct, because he never remembered how he got home. And the next day only, the sun was already high, when the sound of tocsins, drums and bugles woke him. The day before, at Point-du-Jour, the people of Versailles, finding an abandoned gate, had entered Paris freely.","Then Maurice, who had never been a drinker, found himself drawn into the general outbreak of drunkenness and lost in it. Now, when he was on duty at some advanced position or spending the night in the guard-room, he would accept a tot of brandy. If he had a second one he would get worked up in the alcoholic mists whirling round him. It was a growing epidemic, chronic befuddlement, a legacy from the first siege aggravated by the second; a population without bread but with spirits and wine in barrelfuls had steeped itself in drink and now went crazy on the smallest drop. On 21 May, a Sunday, for the first time in his life Maurice went home drunk in the evening to the rue des Orties where he still sometimes slept. He had once again spent the day at Neuilly, fighting and drinking with the comrades in the hope of overcoming his immense, overwhelming fatigue. Then, with his head in a whirl and quite exhausted, he had come back and flung himself on to the bed in his little room, having got there by instinct, for he could never remember how he reached it. It was not until the next day, when the sun was well up, that the sound of bells, drums and bugles woke him. On the previous day the Versailles forces had found a gate unguarded at the Point-du-Jour and had entered Paris unopposed.","Maurice, who had never been a drinking man, allowed himself to be seduced by the too prevalent habit of over-indulgence. It had become a thing of frequent occurrence with him now, when he was out on picket duty or had to spend the night in barracks, to take a “pony” of brandy, and if he took a second it was apt to go to his head in the alcohol-laden atmosphere that he was forced to breathe. It had become epidemic, that chronic drunkenness, among those men with whom bread was scarce and who could have all the brandy they wanted by asking for it. Toward evening on Sunday, the 21st of May, Maurice came home drunk, for the first time in his life, to his room in the Rue des Orties, where he was in the habit of sleeping occasionally. He had been at Neuilly again that day, blazing away at the enemy and taking a nip now and then with the comrades, to see if it would not relieve the terrible fatigue from which he was suffering. Then, with a light head and heavy legs, he came and threw himself on the bed in his little chamber; it must have been through force of instinct, for he could never remember how he got there. And it was not until the following morning, when the sun was high in the heavens, that he awoke, aroused by the ringing of the alarm bells, the blare of trumpets and beating of drums. During the night the Versaillese, finding a gate undefended, had effected an unresisted entrance at the Point-du-Jour."
"Soudain, comme Jean levait les yeux, il vit Henriette, qui était tranquillement revenue, glisser un sac sous la tête du misérable, en guise d’oreiller, après l’avoir couché sur le dos. Il courut, la ramena violemment derrière l’arbre, où il s’abritait avec Maurice.","Suddenly, as Jean raised his eyes, he saw Henriette, who had quietly returned, slipping a sack under the wretch's head, by way of a pillow, after having laid him on his back. He ran, dragged her back violently behind the tree, where he was sheltering with Maurice.",Looking up suddenly Jean saw Henriette who had calmly come back and was slipping a sack under the poor devil’s head by way of a pillow after she had turned him over on to his back. He rushed and pulled her roughly back behind the tree where he was sheltering with Maurice.,"Jean, who happened to look around just at that moment, beheld Henriette glide tranquilly down the steps, approach the wounded man and turn him over, then slip a knapsack beneath his head by way of pillow. He ran and seized her and forcibly brought her back behind the tree where he and Maurice were posted."
"Lorsque Silvine entra, elle ne fut pas surprise de trouver Goliath, qui était resté assis et qui la regardait avec son bon sourire, un peu gêné pourtant. Elle l’attendait, elle s’arrêta simplement, après avoir franchi le seuil, dans un raidissement de tout son être. Et Charlot qui la rejoignait en courant, se jeta dans ses jupes, étonné d’apercevoir un homme qu’il ne connaissait pas.","When Silvine entered, she wasn't surprised to find Goliath, who had remained seated and who was looking at her with his good smile, a little embarrassed though. She was waiting for him, she simply stopped, after crossing the threshold, her whole being stiffening. And Charlie, who was running to her, threw himself into her skirts, astonished to see a man he did not know.","Silvine was not surprised to see Goliath when she came in. He did not get up from his chair, but sat looking at her with his bland smile, though he was just a little ill at ease. She had been expecting him, and all she did was stop just inside the door, and her whole being stiffened. Chariot ran in after her and hid in her skirts, taken aback to see a man he didn’t know.","When Silvine entered the room she was not surprised to find herself in presence of Goliah, who remained seated and contemplated her with his broad smile, in which, however, there was a trace of embarrassment. She had been expecting him, and stood stock-still immediately she stepped across the doorsill, nerving herself and bracing all her faculties. Little Charlot came running up and hid among her petticoats, astonished and frightened to see a strange man there."
"– Ah ! monsieur, oui ! je puis le dire, l’empereur m’a bien trompé… Car, enfin, ses thuriféraires ont beau plaider les circonstances atténuantes, il est évidemment la cause première, l’unique cause de nos désastres.","– Ah! sir, yes! I can say it, the Emperor has really deceived me… Because, after all, his thurifers may well plead extenuating circumstances, he is obviously the first cause, the only cause of our disasters.","He addressed Jean, having only this simple man to talk to. ‘Oh yes, sir, I can say that the Emperor has been a bitter disappointment to me… It’s all very well for his flatterers to plead extenuating circumstances, but obviously he is the prime cause, the sole cause of our misfortunes.’","“Yes, sir, the Emperor has deceived me, and I don't hesitate to say so. His henchmen may put in the plea of mitigating circumstances, but it won't go down, sir; he is evidently the first, the only cause of our misfortunes.”"
"Il était là, avec ce qui restait de l’escouade, Pache et Lapoulle, Loubet et Chouteau. Ceux-ci, après avoir dormi sous une porte de Sedan, s’étaient trouvés réunis de nouveau par le grand coup de balai. Dans la compagnie, d’ailleurs, ils n’avaient plus d’autre chef que le caporal, la mort ayant fauché le sergent Sapin, le lieutenant Rochas et le capitaine Beaudoin. Et, bien que les vainqueurs eussent aboli les grades, en décidant que les prisonniers ne devaient obéissance qu’aux officiers allemands, tous les quatre ne s’en étaient pas moins serrés autour de lui, le sachant prudent et expérimenté, bon à suivre dans les circonstances difficiles. Aussi, ce matin-là, la concorde et la belle humeur régnaient-elles, malgré la bêtise des uns et la mauvaise tête des autres. Pour la nuit, d’abord, il leur avait trouvé un endroit à peu près sec, entre deux rigoles, où ils s’étaient allongés, n’ayant plus, à eux tous, qu’une toile. Ensuite, il venait de se procurer du bois et une marmite, dans laquelle Loubet leur avait fait du café, dont la bonne chaleur les ragaillardissait. La pluie ne tombait plus, la journée s’annonçait superbe, on avait encore un peu de biscuit et de lard ; et puis, comme disait Chouteau, ça faisait plaisir, de ne plus obéir à personne, de flâner à sa fantaisie. On avait beau être enfermé, il y avait de la place. Du reste, dans deux ou trois jours, on serait parti. Si bien que cette première journée, la journée du 4, qui était un dimanche, se passa gaiement.","He was there, with what remained of the squad, Pache and Lapoulle, Loubet and Chouteau. These, after having slept under a door of Sedan, had found themselves reunited again by the great sweep of the broom. In the company, moreover, they had no other leader than the corporal, death having mowed down Sergeant Sapin, Lieutenant Rochas and Captain Beaudoin. And, although the victors had abolished the ranks, deciding that the prisoners owed obedience only to the German officers, all four had nonetheless huddled around him, knowing that he was prudent and experienced, good to follow in difficult circumstances. Also, that morning, harmony and good humor reigned, despite the stupidity of some and the bad head of others. For the night, first of all, he had found them a fairly dry place, between two gutters, where they had stretched out, having, between them all, only a canvas. Then he had just procured some wood and a pot, in which Loubet had made them some coffee, the good heat of which cheered them up. The rain was no longer falling, the day was shaping up to be superb, we still had a bit of biscuit and bacon; and then, as Chouteau used to say, it was a pleasure to no longer obey anyone, to stroll around as he pleased. It was nice to be locked up, there was room. Besides, in two or three days we would be gone. So that this first day, the day of the 4th, which was a Sunday, passed merrily.","There he was, with the rest of the squad, Pache and Lapoulle, Loubet and Chouteau. The last two, having slept in a doorway in Sedan, had been brought in again in the big round-up. The whole company had no other leader now but the corporal, death having cut down Sergeant Sapin, Lieutenant Rochas and Captain Beaudoin. Although the conquerors had abolished ranks and decided that prisoners only had to obey German officers, the four of them had still clung to Jean, knowing how sensible and experienced he was and good to follow in difficult circumstances. So that morning harmony and good humour reigned despite the foolishness of some and the bloody-mindedness of others. To begin with, he had found them a fairly dry spot for the night, between two ditches, where they had stretched themselves out, having only one piece of canvas between them. Then he had just got hold of some wood and a pan, in which Loubet had made them some nice hot coffee that cheered them up. It had stopped raining, and the day bade fair to be superb, they still had some biscuit and bacon left, and besides, as Chouteau remarked, it was a pleasure not to have to obey anyone any more but mess about as you liked. They were shut up, no doubt, but there was plenty of room. In any case they would be off in a day or two. So altogether this first day, Sunday the 4th, passed very happily.","He was there with what remained of the squad, Pache and Lapoulle, Loubet and Chouteau. The last named had slept under doorways in Sedan until the attention of the Prussian provost guard had finally restored them to their regiment. The corporal, moreover, was the only surviving officer of the company, death having taken away Sergeant Sapin, Lieutenant Rochas and Captain Beaudoin, and although the victors had abolished distinction of rank among the prisoners, deciding that obedience was due to the German officers alone, the four men had, nevertheless, rallied to him, knowing him to be a leader of prudence and experience, upon whom they could rely in circumstances of difficulty. Thus it was that peace and harmony reigned among them that morning, notwithstanding the stupidity of some and the evil designs of others. In the first place, the night before he had found them a place to sleep in that was comparatively dry, where they had stretched themselves on the ground, the only thing they had left in the way of protection from the weather being the half of a shelter-tent. After that he had managed to secure some wood and a kettle, in which Loubet made coffee for them, the comforting warmth of which had fortified their stomachs. The rain had ceased, the day gave promise of being bright and warm, they had a small supply of biscuit and bacon left, and then, as Chouteau said, it was a comfort to have no orders to obey, to have their fill of loafing. They were prisoners, it was true, but there was plenty of room to move about. Moreover, they would be away from there in two or three days. Under these circumstances the day, which was Sunday, the 4th, passed pleasantly enough."
– En voilà des généraux de quatre sous qui vont à hue et à dia ! On voit bien que nos jambes ne leur coûtent pas cher.,"""Here are four-penny generals who go to hue and dia!"" We can see that our legs are not expensive for them.","‘There’s a lot of tuppeny-ha’penny generals for you, all going this way and that! You can see our legs don’t cost them nothing.’",“Those cheap-John generals of ours are all at sea again! They must think that men's legs are cheap.”
"Puis, comme il n’était pas du pays et qu’il ne pouvait donner aucun renseignement, il se contenta de montrer de la main une petite ferme voisine, où il avait vu du monde.","Then, as he was not from the country and could not give any information, he contented himself with pointing with his hand to a small neighboring farm, where he had seen people.",As he was a stranger in those parts and could not give any directions he merely pointed out a little farmhouse where he had seen some people.,"Then, as he did not belong to that neighborhood and could not give the information that Prosper wanted, he pointed out a little farmhouse not far away where he had seen some people stirring."
"Il regardait la petite maison blanche, à deux étages, qui faisait l’angle de la place et de la rue de Vouziers, une maison d’aspect bourgeois et calme, dont il évoquait l’intérieur, l’allée centrale en bas, les quatre pièces de chaque étage, comme s’il y était entré la veille encore. En haut, vers l’angle, la fenêtre du premier, ouvrant sur la place, se trouvait éclairée déjà ; et la femme du pharmacien lui expliquait que cette chambre était celle de l’empereur. Mais, comme elle l’avait dit, ce qui flambait surtout, c’était la cuisine, dont la fenêtre, au rez-de-chaussée, donnait sur la rue de Vouziers. Jamais les habitants du Chesne n’avaient eu un pareil spectacle. Un flot de curieux, sans cesse renouvelé, barrait la rue, béant devant cette fournaise, où rôtissait et bouillait le dîner d’un empereur. Pour avoir un peu d’air, les cuisiniers avaient ouvert les vitres toutes grandes. Ils étaient trois, en vestes blanches éblouissantes, s’agitant devant des poulets enfilés dans une immense broche, remuant des sauces au fond d’énormes casseroles, dont le cuivre luisait comme de l’or. Et les vieillards ne se souvenaient pas d’avoir vu, au Lion d’Argent, même pour les plus grandes noces, autant de feu brûlant et autant de nourriture cuisant à la fois.","He was looking at the little white two-storey house at the corner of the square and the rue de Vouziers, a calm, bourgeois-looking house, the interior of which he evoked, the central aisle at the bottom, the four rooms on each floor, as if he had been there only the day before. Upstairs, towards the corner, the window on the first floor, opening onto the square, was already lighted up; and the chemist's wife explained to him that this room was that of the Emperor. But, as she had said, what was on fire above all was the kitchen, whose window, on the ground floor, looked out on the Rue de Vouziers. Never had the inhabitants of Le Chesne had such a spectacle. A stream of onlookers, constantly renewed, barred the street, gaping before this furnace, where the dinner of an emperor was roasting and boiling. To get a little air, the cooks had opened the windows wide. There were three of them, in dazzling white jackets, bustling about in front of chickens threaded on an immense spit, stirring sauces at the bottom of enormous saucepans, the copper of which gleamed like gold. And the old men did not remember having seen, at the Silver Lion, even for the greatest weddings, so much fire burning and so much food cooking at the same time.","He glanced over at the little white two-storey house on the corner of the square and the Vouziers road, a serene, respectable-looking house, and the inside, the central passage-hall on the ground floor, the four rooms on each floor, all came back to his mind as though he had been there only yesterday. There was already a light in the first-floor window nearest the corner that looked on to the square, and the chemist’s wife explained that that was the Emperor’s room. But as she had said, the place which blazed most brightly was the kitchen, the windows of which, on the ground floor, looked on to the Vouziers road. Never had the inhabitants of Le Chêne seen such a show. An ever-rolling stream of sightseers blocked the street, gaping at this furnace on which an Emperor’s dinner was roasting and boiling. So as to get some air, the cooks had thrown the windows wide open. There were three chefs in spotless white jackets busy in front of chickens spiked along an immense spit, stirring sauces in enormous saucepans of copper gleaming like gold. Old men couldn’t remember having seen so much fire and so much food cooking at once at the Lion d’Argent, even for the grandest weddings.","He looked over at the small white, two-storied house that stood at the corner of the market-place and the Rue de Vouziers, a comfortable, unassuming house of bourgeois aspect; how well he remembered it, inside and out, with its central hall and four rooms on each floor; why, it was as if he had just left it! There were lights in the corner room on the first floor overlooking the square; the apothecary's wife informed him that it was the bedroom of the Emperor. But the chief center of activity seemed, as she had said, to be the kitchen, the window of which opened on the Rue de Vouziers. In all their lives the good people of Chene had witnessed no such spectacle, and the street before the house was filled with a gaping crowd, constantly coming and going, who stared with all their eyes at the range on which was cooking the dinner of an Emperor. To obtain a breath of air the cooks had thrown open the window to its full extent. They were three in number, in jackets of resplendent whiteness, superintending the roasting of chickens impaled on a huge spit, stirring the gravies and sauces in copper vessels that shone like gold. And the oldest inhabitant, evoking in memory all the civic banquets that he had beheld at the Silver Lion, could truthfully declare that never at any one time had he seen so much wood burning and so much food cooking."
"Pas un homme ne rigola. C’était vexant tout de même, du café sans sucre ; et encore si l’on avait eu du biscuit ! La veille, sur le plateau de Quatre-Champs, presque tous, pour tromper l’attente, avaient achevé les provisions de leurs sacs, croquant jusqu’aux miettes. Mais l’escouade, heureusement, retrouva une douzaine de pommes de terre, qu’elle se partagea.","Not a man laughed. It was annoying all the same, coffee without sugar; and even if we had had biscuit! The day before, on the plateau of Quatre-Champs, almost everyone, to beat the wait, had finished the provisions of their bags, crunchy to the crumbs. But the squad, fortunately, found a dozen potatoes, which they shared.","But nobody was amused. Coffee without sugar was pretty awful anyway, but if only they had some biscuit! On the plain at Quatre-Champs the day before, almost everybody, for the sake of something to do while hanging about, had finished off the provisions in his pack and swallowed the last crumbs. But fortunately the squad discovered a dozen potatoes, which were shared out.","Not a man of them smiled. It was too bad, all the same, to have to drink their coffee without sugar; and then, too, if they only had some biscuit! Most of them had devoured what eatables they had in their knapsacks, to the very last crumb, to while away their time of waiting, the day before, on the plateau of Quatre-Champs. Among them, however, the members of the squad managed to collect a dozen potatoes, which they shared equally."
"Tout le wagon riait, amusé, conquis, et Lapoulle, sans savoir qui était Badinguet, incapable de dire même s’il se battait pour un empereur ou pour un roi, répétait, de son air de colosse enfant :","The whole carriage laughed, amused, conquered, and Lapoulle, without knowing who Badinguet was, unable to say even if he was fighting for an emperor or for a king, repeated, with his air of a colossal child:","The whole truckload laughed and was won over, and Lapoulle, with no idea who Badinguet was and unable to say even whether he was fighting for an emperor or a king, took up the strain like a baby colossus:","The whole car laughed and applauded, and Lapoulle, who did not know who Badinguet[*] was, and could not have told whether it was a king or an emperor in whose cause he was fighting, repeated like the gigantic baby that he was:"
"D’un geste, il acheva sa pensée, car il eût jugé malséant, devant un Prussien, même sympathique, d’exprimer un désir de paix. Mais ce désir, il était ardemment en lui, comme au fond de toute l’ancienne bourgeoisie plébiscitaire et conservatrice. On allait être à bout de sang et d’argent, il fallait se rendre ; et une sourde rancune contre Paris qui s’entêtait dans sa résistance, montait de toutes les provinces occupées. Aussi conclut-il à voix plus basse, faisant allusion aux proclamations enflammées de Gambetta :","With a gesture, he finished his thought, for he would have thought it improper, in front of a Prussian, even a sympathetic one, to express a desire for peace. But this desire, it was ardently in him, as in the bottom of all the old plebiscite and conservative bourgeoisie. We were going to be out of blood and money, we had to surrender; and a secret resentment against Paris, which persisted in its resistance, rose from all the occupied provinces. So he concludes in a lower voice, alluding to Gambetta's fiery proclamations:","He completed his thought with a gesture, for he would have deemed it improper to express a desire for peace in front of a Prussian, even a friendly one. But this desire was very strong in him, as it was in the hearts of all the old conservative bourgeoisie who had taken part in the referendum. They were coming to the end of their blood and their money and would have to give in, and from all the occupied provinces there was rising a sullen resentment against Paris, with its obstinate resistance. So he lowered his voice and, alluding to Gambetta’s inflammatory proclamation, concluded:","He expressed the conclusion of his idea by a gesture, for he would have considered it improper to speak of his desire for peace before a Prussian, no matter how friendly he might be, although the desire burned fiercely in his bosom, as it did in that of every member of the old conservative bourgeoisie who had favored the plebiscite. Their men and money were exhausted, it was time for them to throw up the sponge; and a deep-seated feeling of hatred toward Paris, for the obstinacy with which it held out, prevailed in all the provinces that were in possession of the enemy. He concluded in a lower tone, his allusion being to Gambetta's inflammatory proclamations:"

"Il alla se planter devant le blessé. Mais, d’un coup d’œil, il dut voir la gravité du cas, car il reprit aussitôt, sans même se baisser pour examiner la jambe atteinte :","He went and planted himself in front of the wounded man. But, at a glance, he must have seen the seriousness of the case, for he resumed immediately, without even bending down to examine the affected leg:","He went and stood in front of the wounded man. But he must have seen at a glance how serious the case was, for he went straight on, without even stooping to examine the injured leg.","And he crossed over at once to the side of the wounded man. A single glance, however, must have sufficed to show him that the case was a bad one, for he added in the same breath, without even stooping to examine the injured member: “Good!"

"Silvine frémit, de le revoir si brusquement, comme surprise de l’image qu’il lui apportait. Ne le connaissait-elle donc plus, cet enfant adoré, qu’elle le regardait effrayée, ainsi qu’une évocation même de son cauchemar ? Puis, elle éclata en larmes.","Silvine shuddered to see him again so suddenly, as if surprised at the image he brought to her. Did she no longer know him, this adored child, that she looked at him frightened, like a very evocation of her nightmare? Then she burst into tears.","Silvine was startled at seeing him so suddenly, as if taken off her guard by the picture he conjured up. Was it that she did not recognize him, this beloved child of hers, that she should now look at him in terror as though he were a nightmare come to life? She burst into tears.","Silvine shivered at his sudden appearance, as if the sight of him had recalled to her mind the image of someone else that affected her disagreeably.

"Ils dirent leur histoire, roulés dans la panique et dans la déroute, restés à demi morts de fatigue au fond d’un fossé, blessés même légèrement l’un et l’autre, et dès lors traînant la jambe à la queue de l’armée, forcés de s’arrêter dans des villes par des crises épuisantes de fièvre, si en retard enfin, qu’ils arrivaient seulement, un peu remis, en quête de leur escouade.","They told their story, rolled in panic and rout, remained half-dead from fatigue at the bottom of a ditch, both even slightly wounded, and from then on dragging their legs at the tail of the armed, forced to stop in cities by exhausting attacks of fever, so late finally, that they arrived only, a little put back, in search of their squad.","They told him their stories, how they were swept on in panic and rout, stayed in the bottom of a trench half dead with fatigue and actually both slightly wounded, and after that they had dragged along in the wake of the army and were obliged to stop in towns with exhausting attacks of fever, and were now so far behind the rest that they had only just arrived, feeling a bit recovered and now looking for their squads.","They told their story, how they had been swept away in the general panic, had crawled into a ditch half-dead with fatigue and hunger, each of them slightly wounded, and since then had been dragging themselves along in the rear of the army, compelled to lie over in towns when the fever-fits came on, until at last they had reached the camp and were on the lookout to find their regiments."
"Mais, à gauche du petit bois, sur un plateau, tout un escadron se montra. Et, devant cette apparition menaçante, un arrêt se fit dans la colonne. Des ordres arrivèrent, le 106e alla prendre position derrière des arbres, au bord d’un ruisseau. Déjà, de l’artillerie rebroussait chemin au galop, s’établissait sur un mamelon. Puis, pendant près de deux heures, on demeura là, en bataille, on s’attarda, sans que rien de nouveau se produisît. À l’horizon, la masse de cavalerie ennemie restait immobile. Et, comprenant enfin qu’on perdait un temps précieux, on repartit.","But, to the left of the little wood, on a plateau, a whole squadron appeared. And, in the face of this threatening apparition, a halt was made in the column. Orders came, the 106th went to take up position behind some trees, at the edge of a stream. Already the artillery was galloping back, establishing itself on a hillock. Then, for almost two hours, we remained there, in battle, we lingered, without anything new happening. On the horizon, the mass of enemy cavalry remained motionless. And, finally realizing that we were wasting precious time, we set off again.","But to the left of the little wood, on a piece of level ground, a whole squadron appeared. In view of this threatening appearance a halt was called in the column. Orders came along and the 106th took up a position behind the trees by a stream. Already the artillery was dashing back and establishing itself on a hillock. Then for nearly two hours they stayed there in battle formation and killed time, but nothing else happened. On the horizon the mass of enemy cavalry stood motionless. Realizing at last that precious time was being lost, the army resumed its march.","But presently an entire squadron came out and showed itself on a plateau to the left of the little wood, and at sight of the threatening demonstration the column halted. An officer came riding up with orders, and the 106th moved off a little and took position on the bank of a small stream behind a clump of trees. The artillery had come hurrying back from the front on a gallop and taken possession of a low, rounded hill. For near two hours they remained there thus in line of battle without the occurrence of anything further; the body of hostile cavalry remained motionless in the distance, and finally, concluding that they were only wasting time that was valuable, the officers set the column moving again."

"Il lui prit la main, la força à le suivre ; et tous deux galopèrent, côte à côte, pliant le dos, traversant ainsi l’espace découvert. Au bout, comme ils se jetaient derrière une meule et qu’ils se retournaient, ils virent de nouveau un obus arriver, tomber droit sur le hangar, à la place qu’ils occupaient tout à l’heure. Le fracas fut épouvantable, le hangar s’abattit.","He took her hand, forced her to follow him; and both gallop side by side, bending their backs, thus crossing the open space. At the end, as they were throwing themselves behind a millstone and turning round, they again saw a shell coming, falling straight on the shed, in the place they had been occupying just now. The crash was terrible, the hangar fell.","He took her hand and pulled her along and, bent double, they both ran side by side across the open space. At the end, as they threw themselves behind a haystack, they saw another shell coming, and it fell right on the barn where they had been just before. The din was appalling, the barn collapsed.","He took her by the hand and dragged her along with him, and in this way they crossed the open together, side by side, running for dear life, with head and shoulders down. When they were safely ensconced behind a stack that opportunely offered its protection at the end of their course and turned to look behind them, they beheld another shell come rushing through the air and alight upon the shed at the very spot they had occupied so lately. The crash was fearful; the shed was knocked to splinters."

"Tous l’acclamaient, tous préféraient un « coup de torchon », pour en finir, dans la fatigue et le découragement qui les envahissaient depuis le départ. On visita les fusils, on changea les aiguilles. Comme on avait mangé la soupe, le matin, on se contenta de café et de biscuit. Ordre était donné de ne pas se coucher. Des grand’gardes furent envoyées à quinze cents mètres, des sentinelles furent détachées jusqu’au bord de l’Aisne. Tous les officiers veillèrent autour des feux de bivouac. Et, contre un petit mur, on distinguait par moments, aux lueurs dansantes d’un de ces feux, les uniformes chamarrés du général en chef et de son état-major, dont les ombres s’agitaient, anxieuses, courant vers la route, guettant le pas des chevaux, dans la mortelle inquiétude où l’on était du sort de la 3e division.","Everyone cheered him on, everyone preferred a ""wipe of the cloth"", to put an end to it, in the fatigue and discouragement that had invaded them since the start. The guns were inspected, the needles were changed. As we had eaten the soup in the morning, we contented ourselves with coffee and biscuits. Order was given not to lie down. Grand guards were sent fifteen hundred yards away, sentries were detached to the banks of the Aisne. All the officers watched around the bivouac fires. And, against a low wall, one could make out at times, in the dancing light of one of these fires, the colorful uniforms of the general-in-chief and his staff, whose shadows moved, anxious, running towards the road, watching the steps of the horses, in the mortal anxiety in which they were for the fate of the 3rd division.","They all applauded him, for in the mood of fatigue and discouragement that had been growing on them since their departure they all preferred a showdown to put an end to it. Rifles were checked and pins changed. As they had had a hot meal in the morning they made do with coffee and biscuit. The order had been not to go to bed. Outposts were placed at fifteen hundred metres, and sentries posted as far as the banks of the Aisne. All the officers sat up round camp fires. And every now and then the flickering light of one of these fires picked out against a low wall glimpses of the gaudy uniforms of the Commander-in-Chief and his staff – shadowy figures darting to and fro, running towards the road, listening out for the sound of horses’ hoofs in this intense anxiety about the fate of the third division.","The little speech was received with loud hurrahs; everyone, in the prevailing suspense and discouragement, preferred to “take the wipe of the dish-clout” and have done with it. Rifles were examined to see that they were in good order, belts were refilled with cartridges. As they had eaten their soup that morning, the men were obliged to content themselves with biscuits and coffee. An order was promulgated that there was to be no sleeping. The grand-guards were out nearly a mile to the front, and a chain of sentinels at frequent intervals extended down to the Aisne. The officers were seated in little groups about the camp-fires, and beside a low wall at the left of the road the fitful blaze occasionally flared up and rescued from the darkness the gold embroideries and bedizened uniforms of the Commander-in-Chief and his staff, flitting to and fro like phantoms, watching the road and listening for the tramp of horses in the mortal anxiety they were in as to the fate of the third division."

Ducat was short and stocky, pasty-looking with thinning hair, Cabasse tall and wiry, swarthy faced with a long, thin nose.","The men were evidently badly scared, but they came forward. Ducat, short and fat, with a pale face and scanty hair; Cabasse short and lean, with a black face and a long nose not much thicker than a knife-blade."
"Mais, cédant à son excitation fiévreuse, Maurice questionnait Jean, voulait savoir. Celui-ci ne disait pas tout, évitait de conter l’enragée colère qui montait contre la Commune agonisante, dans Paris délivré. On était déjà au mercredi. Depuis le dimanche soir, depuis deux grands jours, les habitants avaient vécu au fond de leurs caves, suant la peur ; et, le mercredi matin, lorsqu’ils avaient pu se hasarder, le spectacle des rues défoncées, les débris, le sang, les effroyables incendies surtout, venaient de les jeter à une exaspération vengeresse. Le châtiment allait être immense. On fouillait les maisons, on jetait aux pelotons des exécutions sommaires le flot suspect des hommes et des femmes qu’on ramassait. Dès six heures du soir, ce jour-là, l’armée de Versailles était maîtresse de la moitié de Paris, du parc de Montsouris à la gare du Nord, en passant par les grandes voies. Et les derniers membres de la Commune, une vingtaine, avaient dû se réfugier boulevard Voltaire, à la mairie du XIe arrondissement.","But, yielding to his feverish excitement, Maurice questioned Jean, wanted to know. This one did not say everything, avoided telling the furious anger that was rising against the dying Commune, in freed Paris. We were already on Wednesday. Since Sunday evening, for two long days, the inhabitants had lived in the depths of their cellars, sweating with fear; and on Wednesday morning, when they had been able to venture, the sight of the smashed streets, the debris, the blood, above all the frightful fires, had just thrown them into an avenging exasperation. The punishment was going to be immense. The houses were searched, the suspect stream of men and women they picked up were thrown to the summary execution squads. From six o'clock in the evening that day, the army of Versailles was master of half of Paris, from the Parc de Montsouris to the Gare du Nord, passing through the main roads. And the last members of the Commune, about twenty, had had to take refuge on Boulevard Voltaire, at the town hall of the 11th arrondissement.","Giving in to his nervous excitement Maurice kept questioning Jean and trying to find out things. Jean did not tell him everything, avoiding the blind hatred rising against the expiring Commune now that Paris was free again. It was already Wednesday. Since Sunday evening, that is for two whole days, the residents had been living in cellars sweating with terror, and on the Wednesday morning when they had been able to venture out, the sight of dug-up streets, ruins, blood and above all the terrible fires, had filled them with a terrible lust for vengeance. The reprisals were going to be tremendous. Houses were being searched and crowds of men and women suspects were being chucked in front of summary firing squads. By six in the evening of that day the Versailles army was in control of half Paris, from the Montsouris park to the Gare du Nord, including the main arteries. The last members of the Commune, a score or so of them, had had to take refuge in the town hall of the XIth arrondissement in the Boulevard Voltaire.","But Maurice, in his febrile excitation, questioned Jean, insisting on knowing what had happened since the morning. The latter did not tell him everything, maintaining a discreet silence upon the furious rage which Paris, now it was delivered from its tyrants, was manifesting toward the dying Commune. It was now Wednesday. For two interminable days succeeding the Sunday evening when the conflict first broke out the citizens had lived in their cellars, quaking with fear, and when they ventured out at last on Wednesday morning, the spectacle of bloodshed and devastation that met their eyes on every side, and more particularly the frightful ruin entailed by the conflagrations, aroused in their breasts feelings the bitterest and most vindictive. It was felt in every quarter that the punishment must be worthy of the crime. The houses in the suspected quarters were subjected to a rigorous search and men and women who were at all tainted with suspicion were led away in droves and shot without formality. At six o'clock of the evening of that day the army of the Versaillese was master of the half of Paris, following the line of the principal avenues from the park of Montsouris to the station of the Northern Railway, and the remainder of the braver members of the Commune, a mere handful, some twenty or so, had taken refuge in the mairie of the eleventh arrondissement, in the Boulevard Voltaire."
"Il partit, disparut avec son escorte, au coude du chemin creux, et le feu redoubla. On l’avait aperçu sans doute. Les obus, qui, jusque-là, n’étaient arrivés que de face, se mirent à pleuvoir par le travers, venant de la gauche. C’étaient les batteries de Frénois, et une autre batterie, installée dans la presqu’île d’Iges, qui croisaient leurs salves avec celles du Hattoy. Tout le plateau de l’Algérie en était balayé. Dès lors, la position de la compagnie devint terrible. Les hommes, occupés à surveiller ce qui se passait en face d’eux, eurent cette autre inquiétude dans leur dos, ne sachant à quelle menace échapper. Coup sur coup, trois hommes furent tués, deux blessés hurlèrent.","He left, disappeared with his escort, at the bend of the sunken road, and the fire redoubled. We had undoubtedly seen it. The shells, which until then had only come from the front, began to rain abeam, coming from the left. It was the batteries of Frénois, and another battery, installed in the peninsula of Iges, which crossed their salvos with those of Hattoy. The whole plateau of Algeria was swept away. From then on, the position of the company became terrible. The men, busy watching what was happening in front of them, had this other worry behind them, not knowing what threat to escape. In quick succession, three men were killed, two wounded screamed.","He left, disappearing with his escort round a bend in the sunken road, and the gunfire redoubled its intensity. Perhaps they had spotted him. The shells, which so far had only been coming from straight in front, now began to rain down obliquely from the left. They were the batteries on Frénois and another battery on the Iges peninsula, and they were directing a cross-fire with those on Le Hattoy. The whole plateau of Algérie was being swept by them. From then on the situation of the company became terrible. Men concerned with watching what was happening in front of them had this new worry in their rear and did not know which threat to dodge. Three men were killed in quick succession, and two wounded men were screaming.","He rode off and was lost to view, together with his escort, at the entrance of the sunken road, and the German fire became hotter than before. They had doubtless observed the presence of the group of mounted officers; but now the shells, which hitherto had come from the front, began to fall upon them laterally, from the left; the batteries at Frenois, together with one which the enemy had carried across the river and posted on the peninsula of Iges, had established, in connection with the guns on Hattoy, an enfilading fire which swept the plateau de l'Algerie in its entire length and breadth. The position of the company now became most lamentable; the men, with death in front of them and on their flank, knew not which way to turn or which of the menacing perils to guard themselves against. In rapid succession three men were killed outright and two severely wounded."
"Personne ne parlait plus, l’attente continua. On ne savait même pas si l’on tournait le dos ou la face à l’ennemi. Des bruits vagues, par moments, venaient de l’inconnu du brouillard : grondements de roues, piétinements de foule, trots lointains de chevaux. C’étaient les mouvements de troupes que la brume cachait, toute l’évolution du 7e corps en train de prendre ses positions de combat. Mais, depuis un instant, il semblait que les vapeurs devinssent plus légères. Des lambeaux s’enlevaient comme des mousselines, des coins d’horizon se découvraient, troubles encore, d’un bleu morne d’eau profonde. Et ce fut, dans une de ces éclaircies, qu’on vit défiler, tels qu’une chevauchée de fantômes, les régiments de chasseurs d’Afrique qui faisaient partie de la division Margueritte. Raides sur la selle, avec leurs vestes d’ordonnance, leurs larges ceintures rouges, ils poussaient leurs chevaux, des bêtes minces, à moitié disparues sous la complication du paquetage. Après un escadron, un autre escadron ; et tous, sortis de l’incertain, rentraient dans l’incertain, avaient l’air de se fondre sous la pluie fine. Sans doute, ils gênaient, on les emmenait plus loin, ne sachant qu’en faire, ainsi que cela arrivait depuis le commencement de la campagne. À peine les avait-on employés comme éclaireurs, et, dès que le combat s’engageait, on les promenait de vallon en vallon, précieux et inutiles.","No one spoke, the wait continued. We didn't even know if we were turning our backs or facing the enemy. Occasionally vague noises came from the unknown fog: the rumble of wheels, the trampling of the crowd, the distant trotting of horses. These were the troop movements that the mist hid, the whole evolution of the 7th Corps taking up its combat positions. But, for a moment, it seemed that the vapors were becoming lighter. Shreds were lifted off like muslin, corners of the horizon were revealed, still murky, of the gloomy blue of deep water. And it was in one of these clearings that the regiments of chasseurs d'Afrique which formed part of Margueritte's division were seen defiling past, like a cavalcade of phantoms. Stiff in the saddle, with their regular jackets, their wide red belts, they pushed their horses, slender beasts, half-disappeared under the complication of packing. After a squadron, another squadron; and all of them, coming out of the uncertainty, reentering the uncertainty, seemed to melt under the fine rain. No doubt they were in the way, they were taken away, not knowing what to do with them, as had happened since the beginning of the campaign. Scarcely had they been employed as scouts, and as soon as the battle began they were marched from valley to valley, precious and useless.","The talking stopped and the wait went on. There was no knowing even whether they had their backs or their fronts to the enemy. Vague sounds came now and again out of the foggy unknown: rumbling of wheels, tramping of feet, distant trotting of horses. These were troop movements hidden by the mist, all the manoeuvres of the 7th corps taking up its battle positions. But in the last few minutes the mist seemed to be thinning out. Shreds blew up like wisps of gauze and odd corners of the horizon came into sight, still indistinct, like the murky blue of deep water. It was in one of these breaks that the regiments of Chasseurs d’Afrique that formed part of the Margueritte division could be seen moving along like a procession of phantom riders. Bolt upright in their saddles, in their full regimentals with broad red belts, they were spurring on their mounts, slender creatures half hidden by their complicated kit. Squadron after squadron, they all emerged from the murk and went back into it as though they were melting in the fine drizzle. No doubt they were a nuisance and were being moved further off because nobody knew what to do with them, as had been the case since the outset of the campaign. They had been used just occasionally as scouts, and as soon as battle was joined they were moved from valley to valley as an expensive luxury.","No one spoke; the uncertainty and suspense continued. They knew not whether the enemy was on their front or in their rear. Strange sounds came to their ears from time to time from out the depths of the mysterious fog: the rumble of wheels, the deadened tramp of moving masses, the distant clatter of horses' hoofs; it was the evolutions of troops, hidden from view behind the misty curtain, the batteries, battalions, and squadrons of the 7th corps taking up their positions in line of battle. Now, however, it began to look as if the fog was about to lift; it parted here and there and fragments floated lightly off, like strips of gauze torn from a veil, and bits of sky appeared, not transparently blue, as on a bright summer's day, but opaque and of the hue of burnished steel, like the cheerless bosom of some deep, sullen mountain tarn. It was in one of those brighter moments when the sun was endeavoring to struggle forth that the regiments of chasseurs d'Afrique, constituting part of Margueritte's division, came riding by, giving the impression of a band of spectral horsemen. They sat very stiff and erect in the saddle, with their short cavalry jackets, broad red sashes and smart little kepis, accurate in distance and alignment and managing admirably their lean, wiry mounts, which were almost invisible under the heterogeneous collection of tools and camp equipage that they had to carry. Squadron after squadron they swept by in long array, to be swallowed in the gloom from which they had just emerged, vanishing as if dissolved by the fine rain. The truth was, probably, that they were in the way, and their leaders, not knowing what use to put them to, had packed them off the field, as had often been the case since the opening of the campaign. They had scarcely ever been employed on scouting or reconnoitering duty, and as soon as there was prospect of a fight were trotted about for shelter from valley to valley, useless objects, but too costly to be endangered."
"Pitoyable en somme, Delaherche frémissait de compassion, lorsque l’entrée d’un landau, sous le porche, l’intéressa. On n’avait plus trouvé sans doute que cette voiture de maître, et l’on y avait entassé des blessés. Ils y tenaient huit, les uns sur les autres. Le fabricant eut un cri de surprise terrifiée, en reconnaissant, dans le dernier qu’on descendit, le capitaine Beaudoin.","Pitiful on the whole, Delaherche quivered with compassion when the entry of a landau, under the porch, interested him. No doubt nothing had been found but this master's carriage, and the wounded had been piled into it. They held eight of them, one on top of the other. The manufacturer gave a cry of terrified surprise on recognizing Captain Beaudoin in the last one to be descended.","A kindly man at bottom, Delaherche was shuddering with pity when his attention was caught by a landau coming through the gateway. Presumably this grand carriage was all they had managed to find, and it was piled with wounded, eight of them one on top of the other. Delaherche uttered a cry of astonishment and horror when he saw that the last one to be carried out was Captain Beaudoin.","Delaherche, naturally a soft-hearted man, was in a quiver of compassionate emotion at the spectacle that lay before his eyes, when his attention was attracted by a landau that drove up to the door. It was a private carriage, but doubtless the ambulance attendants had found none other ready to their hand and had crowded their patients into it. There were eight of them, sitting on one another's knees, and as the last man alighted the manufacturer recognized Captain Beaudoin, and gave utterance to a cry of terror and surprise."
"– Oui, oui ! la mort !",- Yes yes ! the death !,"‘Yes, yes, death!’","“Yes, yes! death!”"
"Ce samedi-là, d’ailleurs, la disette cessa. Comme on était moins nombreux et que des vivres arrivaient de toutes parts, on passa d’un coup de l’extrême dénuement à l’abondance la plus large. On eut à volonté du pain, de la viande, du vin même, on mangea du lever au coucher du soleil, à en mourir. La nuit tomba, qu’on mangeait encore, et l’on mangea jusqu’au lendemain matin. Beaucoup en crevèrent.","That Saturday, moreover, the scarcity ceased. As there were fewer of us and food was arriving from all sides, we suddenly went from extreme destitution to the greatest abundance. We had unlimited bread, meat, even wine, we ate from sunrise to sunset, to death. Night fell, we were still eating, and we ate until the next morning. Many died.","And yet that Saturday saw the end of the famine. As they were fewer and provisions were coming in from all directions, they went abruptly from extreme deprivation to the most generous abundance. They had as much bread, meat and even wine as they wanted, and ate from morn till night enough to kill themselves. Night came and they were still eating, and went on until the next morning. Many died of it.","That day, however, was the last on which they suffered from famine. As their numbers were so greatly reduced and provisions kept pouring in from every quarter, they passed at a single bound from the extreme of destitution to the most abundant plenty. Bread, meat, and wine, even, were to be had without stint; eating went on from morning till night, until they were ready to drop. Darkness descended, and they were eating still; in some quarters the gorging was continued until the next morning. To many it proved fatal."
"– Mais, mon général, dit un sergent, on ne peut plus passer, il y a des Prussiens partout… C’était bon ce matin, de filer.","""But, general,"" said a sergeant, ""we can't get through any more, there are Prussians everywhere. It was good to slip away this morning.""","‘But sir,’ said a sergeant, ‘you can’t get through now, there are Prussians everywhere. It was all right this morning, you could have done a bunk then.’","“But you won't get through, General,” spoke up a sergeant; “the Prussians are everywhere. This morning was the time for you to cut stick.”"

"L’attaque s’annonçait terrible. Du côté des prairies, la fusillade avait cessé. Maîtres d’un ruisseau étroit, bordé de peupliers et de saules, les Bavarois s’apprêtaient à donner l’assaut aux maisons qui défendaient la place de l’Église ; et leurs tirailleurs s’étaient prudemment repliés, le soleil seul dormait en nappe d’or sur le déroulement immense des herbes, que tachaient quelques masses noires, les corps des soldats tués. Aussi le lieutenant venait-il de quitter la cour de la teinturerie, en y laissant une sentinelle, comprenant que, désormais, le danger allait être du côté de la rue. Vivement, il rangea ses hommes le long du trottoir, avec l’ordre, si l’ennemi s’emparait de la place, de se barricader au premier étage du bâtiment, et de s’y défendre, jusqu’à la dernière cartouche. Couchés par terre, abrités derrière les bornes, profitant des moindres saillies, les hommes tiraient à volonté ; et c’était, le long de cette large voie, ensoleillée et déserte, un ouragan de plomb, des rayures de fumée, comme une averse de grêle chassée par un grand vent. On vit une jeune fille traverser la chaussée d’une course éperdue, sans être atteinte. Puis, un vieillard, un paysan vêtu d’une blouse, qui s’obstinait à faire rentrer son cheval à l’écurie, reçut une balle en plein front, et d’un tel choc, qu’il en fut projeté au milieu de la route. La toiture de l’église venait d’être défoncée par la chute d’un obus. Deux autres avaient incendié des maisons, qui flambaient dans la lumière vive, avec des craquements de charpente. Et cette misérable Françoise broyée près de son enfant malade, ce paysan avec une balle dans le crâne, ces démolitions et ces incendies achevaient d’exaspérer les habitants qui avaient mieux aimé mourir là que de se sauver en Belgique. Des bourgeois, des ouvriers, des gens en paletot et en bourgeron, tiraient rageusement par les fenêtres.","The attack was terrible. On the side of the prairies, the firing had ceased. Masters of a narrow stream, bordered by poplars and willows, the Bavarians were preparing to attack the houses which defended the Place de l'Eglise; and their skirmishers had prudently fallen back, the sun alone slept in a sheet of gold on the immense unrolling of the grass, stained by a few black masses, the bodies of the soldiers killed. So the lieutenant had just left the dyeing yard, leaving a sentry there, realizing that henceforth the danger was going to be on the side of the street. Quickly, he ranged his men along the sidewalk, with the order, if the enemy seized the place, to barricade themselves on the first floor of the building, and to defend themselves there, to the last cartridge. Lying on the ground, sheltered behind the bollards, taking advantage of the smallest projections, the men fired at will; and it was, along this broad, sunny and deserted way, a leaden hurricane, streaks of smoke, like a shower of hail driven by a strong wind. A young girl was seen crossing the road in a frantic race, without being hit. Then, an old man, a peasant dressed in a blouse, who persisted in having his horse returned to the stable, received a bullet in the forehead, and from such a shock, that he was thrown into the middle of the the road. The roof of the church had just been smashed by the fall of a shell. Two others had set fire to houses, which blazed in the bright light, with the creaking of the framework. And this wretched Françoise crushed near her sick child, this peasant with a bullet in the skull, these demolitions and these fires completed the exasperation of the inhabitants who had preferred to die there than to flee to Belgium. Citizens, workmen, people in overcoats and smocks, fired furiously from the windows.","Clearly the attack was going to be terrible. The fusillade from the meadows had died down. The Bavarians were masters of the little stream fringed with poplars and willows, and were now preparing for an assault on the houses defending the church square, and so their snipers had prudently drawn back. The sun shone in golden splendour on the great stretch of grassland, dotted with a few black patches, the bodies of killed soldiers. So the lieutenant had moved out of the yard of the dyeworks, leaving a sentry there, realizing that the danger was now going to be on the street side. He quickly disposed his men along the pavement, with orders that in the event of the enemy’s capturing the square they should barricade themselves in the first floor of the building and resist there to the last bullet. Lying on the ground, sheltering behind stones or taking advantage of the slightest projections, the men were firing all out, and along this wide, sunlit and empty street there was a hurricane of lead with streaks of smoke, like a hailstorm blown by a high wind. A young girl was seen running across the road in terror, but she was not hit. But then an old man, a yokel in a smock, was insisting on getting his horse into a stable, and he was struck in the forehead by a bullet with such force that it knocked him into the middle of the road. The roof of the church was blown in by a shell. Two other shells had set fire to houses, which blazed up in the bright light with cracklings of timber. And poor Françoise’s body, smashed beside her sick child, the old peasant with a bullet through his skull, the destruction and the fires goaded to exasperation inhabitants who had preferred to die there rather than run away into Belgium. Bourgeois, workmen, people in overcoats or overalls, all of them were firing frenziedly through the windows.","The assault was made with great vigor and determination. There was no longer any sound of musketry in the direction of the meadows. The Bavarians had gained possession of a narrow stream, fringed with willows and poplars, and were making preparations for storming the houses, or rather fortresses, in the Place de l'Eglise. Their skirmishers had fallen back with the same caution that characterized their advance, and the wide grassy plain, dotted here and there with a black form where some poor fellow had laid down his life, lay spread in the mellow, slumbrous sunshine like a great cloth of gold. The lieutenant, knowing that the street was now to be the scene of action, had evacuated the courtyard of the dyehouse, leaving there only one man as guard. He rapidly posted his men along the sidewalk with instructions, should the enemy carry the position, to withdraw into the building, barricade the first floor, and defend themselves there as long as they had a cartridge left. The men fired at will, lying prone upon the ground, and sheltering themselves as best they might behind posts and every little projection of the walls, and the storm of lead, interspersed with tongues of flame and puffs of smoke, that tore through that broad, deserted, sunny avenue was like a downpour of hail beaten level by the fierce blast of winter. A woman was seen to cross the roadway, running with wild, uncertain steps, and she escaped uninjured. Next, an old man, a peasant, in his blouse, who would not be satisfied until he saw his worthless nag stabled, received a bullet square in his forehead, and the violence of the impact was such that it hurled him into the middle of the street. A shell had gone crashing through the roof of the church; two others fell and set fire to houses, which burned with a pale flame in the intense daylight, with a loud snapping and crackling of their timbers. And that poor woman, who lay crushed and bleeding in the doorway of the house where her sick boy was, that old man with a bullet in his brain, all that work of ruin and devastation, maddened the few inhabitants who had chosen to end their days in their native village rather than seek safety in Belgium. Other bourgeois, and workingmen as well, the neatly attired citizen alongside the man in overalls, had possessed themselves of the weapons of dead soldiers, and were in the street defending their firesides or firing vengefully from the windows."
"Alors, Maurice, échappé à la tuerie, tout frémissant de s’être battu, n’avait plus eu que de la haine contre ce prétendu gouvernement d’ordre et de légalité, qui, écrasé à chaque rencontre par les Prussiens, retrouvait seulement du courage pour vaincre Paris. Et les armées allemandes étaient encore là, de Saint-Denis à Charenton, assistant à ce beau spectacle de l’effondrement d’un peuple ! Aussi, dans la crise sombre de destruction qui l’envahissait, approuva-t-il les premières mesures violentes, la construction de barricades barrant les rues et les places, l’arrestation des otages, l’archevêque, des prêtres, d’anciens fonctionnaires. Déjà, de part et d’autre, les atrocités commençaient : Versailles fusillait les prisonniers, Paris décrétait que, pour la tête d’un de ses combattants, il ferait tomber trois têtes d’otages ; et le peu de raison qui restait à Maurice, après tant de secousses et de ruines, s’en allait au vent de fureur soufflant de partout. La Commune lui apparaissait comme une vengeresse des hontes endurées, comme une libératrice apportant le fer qui ampute, le feu qui purifie. Cela n’était pas très clair dans son esprit, le lettré en lui évoquait simplement des souvenirs classiques, des villes libres et triomphantes, des fédérations de riches provinces imposant leur loi au monde. Si Paris l’emportait, il le voyait, dans une gloire, reconstituant une France de justice et de liberté, réorganisant une société nouvelle, après avoir balayé les débris pourris de l’ancienne. À la vérité, après les élections, les noms des membres de la Commune l’avaient un peu surpris par l’extraordinaire mélange de modérés, de révolutionnaires, de socialistes de toutes sectes, à qui la grande œuvre se trouvait confiée. Il connaissait plusieurs de ces hommes, il les jugeait d’une grande médiocrité. Les meilleurs n’allaient-ils pas se heurter, s’annihiler, dans la confusion des idées qu’ils représentaient ? Mais, le jour où la Commune fut solennellement constituée, sur la place de l’Hôtel-de-Ville, pendant que le canon tonnait et que les trophées de drapeaux rouges claquaient au vent, il avait voulu tout oublier, soulevé de nouveau par un espoir sans bornes. Et l’illusion recommençait, dans la crise aiguë du mal à son paroxysme, au milieu des mensonges des uns et de la foi exaltée des autres.","Then Maurice, having escaped the slaughter, all quivering from having fought, had no longer had anything but hatred against this pretended government of order and legality, which, crushed at each encounter by the Prussians, only found strength. courage to defeat Paris. And the German armies were still there, from Saint-Denis to Charenton, witnessing this beautiful spectacle of the collapse of a people! Also, in the dark crisis of destruction that invaded him, he approved the first violent measures, the construction of barricades blocking the streets and squares, the arrest of hostages, the archbishop, priests, elders officials. Already, on both sides, the atrocities were beginning: Versailles shot the prisoners, Paris decreed that, for the head of one of its combatants, it would cause three hostage heads to fall; and the little reason that remained to Maurice, after so many shocks and ruins, was gone by the wind of fury blowing everywhere. The Commune appeared to him as an avenger of the shame endured, as a liberator bringing the iron which amputates, the fire which purifies. It was not very clear in his mind, the scholar in him simply evoked classic memories, of free and triumphant cities, of federations of rich provinces imposing their law on the world. If Paris won, he saw it, in glory, reconstituting a France of justice and freedom, reorganizing a new society, after having swept away the rotten debris of the old. In truth, after the elections, the names of the members of the Commune had surprised him a little by the extraordinary mixture of moderates, revolutionaries, socialists of all sects, to whom the great work was entrusted. He knew several of these men, he considered them very mediocre. Weren't the best ones going to collide, to annihilate each other, in the confusion of the ideas they represent? But on the day when the Commune was solemnly constituted, on the Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville, while the cannon thundered and the trophies of red flags flapped in the wind, he had wanted to forget everything, lifted up again by a boundless hope. And the illusion began again, in the acute crisis of evil at its climax, amid the lies of some and the exalted faith of others.","Maurice escaped from the slaughter, and, all elated at having been in the fighting, had nothing but hatred left for this so-called government of law and order which, crushed at every encounter with the Prussians, only recovered courage to conquer the Parisians. And the German armies were still there, from Saint-Denis to Charenton, watching the edifying spectacle of the collapse of a people! So in the evil fever of destruction that took hold of him Maurice approved of the first violent measures, the throwing up of barricades across streets and squares, the taking of hostages, the archbishop, priests and former officials. On both sides atrocities were already being committed: Versailles shot prisoners, Paris decreed that for every one of its fighters killed the heads of three of its hostages would fall, and what common sense Maurice had left after so much shock and ruin was blown away by the wind of fury coming from all directions. The Commune now seemed to him to be the avenger of the shameful things they had endured, a kind of liberator bringing the knife to amputate and the fire to purify. None of this was very clear in his mind, and the educated man within him simply called up classical memories of free triumphant city-states or federations of rich provinces imposing their will on the world. If Paris won he visualized it in glory, reconstituting a France of justice and liberty, reorganizing a new society after sweeping away the rotten debris of the old. True, after the elections he had been somewhat surprised by the names of the members of the Commune, with its extraordinary jumble of moderates, militant revolutionaries and socialists of all colours, to whom the great task was entrusted. He knew some of these men personally, and thought they were a very mediocre lot. Were not the best of them going to clash and destroy each other in the confusion of ideas they represented? But on the day when the Commune was solemnly constituted in the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville, while the cannon roared and trophies of red flags flapped in the wind, he had made the effort to forget everything, and once again was borne away by boundless hopes. And so illusion began again in the crisis atmosphere of a disease at its climax, made up of the lies of some and the starry-eyed faith of others.","Then Maurice, who had escaped unharmed from the slaughter, his nerves still quivering with the fury that had inspired him on the battlefield, was filled with fresh detestation for that so-called government of law and order which always allowed itself to be beaten by the Prussians, and could only muster up a little courage when it came to oppressing Paris. And the German armies were still there, from Saint-Denis to Charenton, watching the shameful spectacle of internecine conflict! Thus, in the fierce longing for vengeance and destruction that animated him, he could not do otherwise than sanction the first measures of communistic violence, the building of barricades in the streets and public squares, the arrest of the archbishop, some priests, and former officeholders, who were to be held as hostages. The atrocities that distinguished either side in that horrible conflict were already beginning to manifest themselves, Versailles shooting the prisoners it made, Paris retaliating with a decree that for each one of its soldiers murdered three hostages should forfeit their life. The horror of it, that fratricidal conflict, that wretched nation completing the work of destruction by devouring its own children! And the little reason that remained to Maurice, in the ruin of all the things he had hitherto held sacred, was quickly dissipated in the whirlwind of blind fury that swept all before it. In his eyes the Commune was to be the avenger of all the wrongs they had suffered, the liberator, coming with fire and sword to purify and punish. He was not quite clear in mind about it all, but remembered having read how great and flourishing the old free cities had become, how wealthy provinces had federated and imposed their law upon the world. If Paris should be victorious he beheld her, crowned with an aureole of glory, building up a new France, where liberty and justice should be the watchwords, organizing a new society, having first swept away the rotten debris of the old. It was true that when the result of the elections became known he was somewhat surprised by the strange mixture of moderates, revolutionists, and socialists of every sect and shade to whom the accomplishment of the great work was intrusted; he was acquainted with several of the men and knew them to be of extremely mediocre abilities. Would not the strongest among them come in collision and neutralize one another amid the clashing ideas which they represented? But on the day when the ceremony of the inauguration of the Commune took place before the Hotel de Ville, amid the thunder of artillery and trophies and red banners floating in the air, his boundless hopes again got the better of his fears and he ceased to doubt. Among the lies of some and the unquestioning faith of others, the illusion started into life again with renewed vigor, in the acute crisis of the malady raised to paroxysmal pitch."
"C’était, à la lisière du bois, un homme grand et maigre, dont on distinguait mal l’épaisse barbe en broussaille. Il portait une blouse grise, serrée à la taille par une ceinture rouge, et avait un fusil en bandoulière. Tout de suite, il expliqua qu’il était Français, franc-tireur, sergent, et qu’il venait, avec deux de ses hommes, des bois de Dieulet, pour donner des renseignements au général.","At the edge of the wood he was a tall, thin man, whose thick, bushy beard was hard to distinguish. He wore a gray smock, tied at the waist with a red belt, and had a gun slung over his shoulder. He immediately explained that he was French, a sniper, a sergeant, and that he had come with two of his men from the Bois de Dieulet to give information to the general.","On the edge of the wood was a tall, gaunt man whose thick, bushy beard could just be made out. He had on a grey smock pulled in at the waist with a red belt, and carried a rifle slung over his shoulder. He at once explained that he was French, a sergeant in the guerrillas, and that he had come with two of his men from the Dieulet woods to bring some information to the general.","And there at the edge of the wood stood a tall, lanky man, whose thick, bristling beard they could just distinguish in the darkness. He wore a gray blouse, confined at the waist by a red belt, and carried a musket slung by a strap over his shoulder. He hurriedly explained that he was French, a sergeant of francs-tireurs, and had come with two of his men from the wood of Dieulet, bringing important information for the general."
"Quand les deux nouveaux venus se furent assis dans le fossé, l’attente recommença. De temps à autre, un des hommes se levait, s’assurait que le cheval était bien toujours là, tendant le cou vers les souffles frais de la Meuse, vers le soleil couchant, pour en boire encore toute la vie. Puis, enfin, lorsque le crépuscule vint lentement, les six furent debout, dans ce guet sauvage, impatients de la nuit si paresseuse, regardant de toutes parts, avec une inquiétude effarée, si personne ne les voyait.","When the two newcomers had sat down in the ditch, the wait began again. From time to time, one of the men got up, made sure that the horse was still there, craning his neck towards the cool breezes of the Meuse, towards the setting sun, to drink all his life from it. Then, finally, when twilight came slowly, the six were up, in this wild watch, impatient for the lazy night, looking in all directions, with bewildered anxiety, if no one saw them.","The two newcomers sat in the ditch and the wait was resumed. Every so often one of them stood up and made sure that the horse was still there stretching his neck towards where the cool air of the Meuse came from, towards the setting sun, to drink in what life was left there. At last, when dusk had slowly come down, the six stood up; in this savage watch they were impatient with the slowness of nightfall, keeping a look-out in all directions, nerves on edge in case anybody should see them.","The two newcomers seated themselves in the ditch and joined the others in their expectancy. Now and again one of the men would rise and make certain that the horse was still there, its neck outstretched to catch the cool exhalations of the Meuse and the last rays of the setting sun, as if bidding farewell to life. And when at last twilight crept slowly o'er the scene the six men were erect upon their feet, impatient that night was so tardy in its coming, casting furtive"
"Jean, bégayant, le supplia de nouveau, en phrases éperdues. Non, non ! il ne fallait point vouloir le mal ! Si c’était la destruction de tout, eux-mêmes allaient donc périr ? Et il n’avait plus qu’une hâte, aborder, échapper au terrible spectacle. Pourtant, il eut la prudence de dépasser encore le pont de la Concorde, de façon à ne débarquer que sur la berge du quai de la Conférence, après le coude de la Seine. Et, à ce moment critique, au lieu de laisser aller le canot, il perdit quelques minutes à l’amarrer solidement, dans son respect instinctif du bien des autres. Son plan était de gagner la rue des Orties, par la place de la Concorde et la rue Saint-Honoré. Après avoir fait asseoir Maurice sur la berge, il monta seul l’escalier du quai, il fut repris d’inquiétude, en comprenant quelle peine ils auraient à franchir les obstacles entassés là. C’était l’imprenable forteresse de la Commune, la terrasse des Tuileries armée de canons, les rues Royale, Saint-Florentin et de Rivoli barrées par de hautes barricades, solidement construites ; et cela expliquait la tactique de l’armée de Versailles, dont les lignes, cette nuit-là, formaient un immense angle rentrant, le sommet à la place de la Concorde, les deux extrémités, l’une, sur la rive droite, à la gare des marchandises de la Compagnie du Nord, l’autre, sur la rive gauche, à un bastion des remparts, près de la porte d’Arcueil. Mais le jour allait naître, les communards avaient évacué les Tuileries et les barricades, la troupe venait de s’emparer du quartier, au milieu d’autres incendies, douze autres maisons qui brûlaient depuis neuf heures du soir, au carrefour de la rue Saint-Honoré et de la rue Royale.","Jean, stammering, begged him again, in frantic phrases. No no ! it was not necessary to wish the evil! If it was the destruction of everything, would they themselves perish? And he was only in a hurry, to approach, to escape the terrible spectacle. However, he had the prudence to pass the Pont de la Concorde still further, so as to disembark only on the bank of the Quai de la Conférence, after the bend in the Seine. And, at this critical moment, instead of letting go of the canoe, he lost a few minutes mooring it securely, in his instinctive respect for the good of others. His plan was to reach the rue des Orties, by the place de la Concorde and the rue Saint-Honoré. After making Maurice sit down on the bank, he climbed the stairs to the quay alone. It was the impregnable fortress of the Commune, the terrace of the Tuileries armed with cannons, the Rues Royale, Saint-Florentin, and Rivoli barred by high, solidly constructed barricades; and that explained the tactics of the army of Versailles, whose lines, that night, formed an immense re-entrant angle, the summit at the Place de la Concorde, the two extremities, one, on the right bank, at the Compagnie du Nord freight station, the other, on the left bank, at a bastion of the ramparts, near the Porte d'Arcueil. But day was about to dawn, the Communards had evacuated the Tuileries and the barricades, the troops had just seized the district, in the midst of other fires, twelve other houses which had been burning since nine o'clock at night, at the crossroads of the rue Saint -Honoré and Rue Royale.","Jean was almost speechless and in disjointed words begged him to stop. No, no, one mustn’t wish for evil! If it meant total destruction wouldn’t they perish as well? He had only one urgent job, to land and get away from this awful sight. All the same he was prudent enough to go past the Concorde bridge so as not to leave the boat until the towpath below the Quai de la Conférence, beyond the bend in the Seine. Yet at that critical moment, instead of just letting the boat drift away he lost several minutes mooring it safely, with his instinctive respect for other people’s property. His plan was to reach the rue des Orties by way of the Place de la Concorde and the rue Saint-Honoré. Having sat Maurice down on the towpath he went up the steps to the roadway alone, and once again he was very worried when he realized what difficulty they would have in getting past the obstacles piled up there. For this was the impregnable fortress of the Commune, the Tuileries terrace fortified with guns and the rue Royale, rue Saint-Florentin and rue de Rivoli blocked by high barricades strongly constructed. This explained the tactics of the Versailles army, whose lines that night formed a huge concave angle with its apex at the Place de la Concorde and one extremity, the one on the right bank, at the goods yard of the Northern Railway and the other, on the left bank, at a bastion of the fortifications near the Arcueil gate. But it would soon be daybreak, the Communards had evacuated the Tuileries and the barricades, and the troops had just taken over the area, amid still more fires – twelve more houses that had been burning since nine at the intersection of the rue Saint-Honoré and the rue Royale.","Again Jean, in stammering, disconnected sentences, besought him to be quiet. No, no, it was not right to wish evils to anyone! And if they invoked destruction, would not they themselves perish in the general ruin? His sole desire was to find a landing place so that he might no longer have that horrid spectacle before his eyes. He considered it best not to attempt to land at the Pont de la Concorde, but, rounding the elbow of the Seine, pulled on until they reached the Quai de la Conference, and even at that critical moment, instead of shoving the skiff out into the stream to take its chances, he wasted some precious moments in securing it, in his instinctive respect for the property of others. While doing this he had seated Maurice comfortably on the bank; his plan was to reach the Rue des Orties through the Place de la Concorde and the Rue Saint-Honore. Before proceeding further he climbed alone to the top of the steps that ascended from the quai to explore the ground, and on witnessing the obstacles they would have to surmount his courage was almost daunted. There lay the impregnable fortress of the Commune, the terrace of the Tuileries bristling with cannon, the Rues Royale, Florentin, and Rivoli obstructed by lofty and massive barricades; and this state of affairs explained the tactics of the army of Versailles, whose line that night described an immense arc, the center and apex resting on the Place de la Concorde, one of the two extremities being at the freight depot of the Northern Railway on the right bank, the other on the left bank, at one of the bastions of the ramparts, near the gate of Arcueil. But as the night advanced the Communards had evacuated the Tuileries and the barricades and the regular troops had taken possession of the quartier in the midst of further conflagrations; twelve houses at the junction of the Rue Saint-Honore and the Rue Royale had been burning since nine o'clock in the evening."

L’immense plan en relief allait d’un bord du ciel à l’autre ; tandis que, debout sur la colline, comme du trône réservé de cette gigantesque loge de gala, il regardait.","Up there, on the Marfée, was King William and his staff. At seven o'clock he had come from Vendresse, where he had slept, and he found himself up there, sheltered from all danger, having before him the valley of the Meuse, the boundless unfolding of the battlefield. The huge relief map went from one edge of the sky to the other; while, standing on the hill, as if from the reserved throne of this gigantic gala box, he watched.","Up there on La Marfée it was King William and his general staff.

The immense relief map went from one end of the sky to the other, and he, standing on the hill, looked on as though from a throne reserved for him in this gigantic box at a gala performance.","Those who were up there on la Marfee were King William and his staff. As early as seven o'clock he had ridden up from Vendresse, where he had had quarters for the night, and now was up there on the heights, out of reach of danger, while at his feet lay the valley of the Meuse and the vast panorama of the field of battle.

Mais il défendait encore la dynastie, il plaignait Napoléon III, que tout le monde trompait. Ainsi, à l’entendre, les véritables auteurs de nos désastres n’étaient autres que les députés républicains de l’opposition, qui avaient empêché de voter le nombre d’hommes et les crédits nécessaires.","An ardent Bonapartist at the time of the plebiscite, Delaherche, since the first defeats, admitted that the empire had made mistakes. But he still defended the dynasty, he pitied Napoleon III, whom everyone deceived. Thus, to hear him, the real authors of our disasters were none other than the Republican opposition deputies, who had prevented the necessary number of men and credits from being voted.","Delaherche had been an ardent Bonapartist at the time of the plebiscite, but since the first reverses he admitted that the Empire had made some mistakes. However, he still defended the dynasty and pitied Napoleon III, who was being deceived by everybody. So according to him the people really responsible for our disasters were none other than the republican deputies in the opposition who had prevented the voting of the necessary numbers of men and financial credits.","Delaherche, although he was an ardent Bonapartist at the time of the plebiscite, had admitted after our early defeats that the government was responsible for some mistakes, but he stood up for the dynasty, compassionating and excusing Napoleon III. , deceived and betrayed as he was by everyone. It was his firm opinion that the men at whose door should be laid the responsibility for all our disasters were none other than those Republican deputies of the opposition who had stood in the way of voting the necessary men and money."

But come back, or I'll get you.","‘You go,’ she said. ‘But come back or else I shall come and fetch you!’","“Well, then, go,” she said. “But remember, if you are not back in good season you will see me out there looking for you.”"

"Et le formidable duel d’artillerie continua, s’aggrava, par-dessus la tête des régiments couchés, dans la campagne ardente et morne, où pas une âme n’apparaissait, sous le brûlant soleil. Il n’y avait que ce tonnerre, que cet ouragan de destruction, roulant au travers de cette solitude. Les heures allaient s’écouler, cela ne cesserait point. Mais déjà la supériorité de l’artillerie allemande s’indiquait, les obus à percussion éclataient presque tous, à des distances énormes ; tandis que les obus français, à fusée, d’un vol beaucoup plus court, s’enflammaient le plus souvent en l’air, avant d’être arrivés au but. Et aucune autre ressource que de se faire tout petit, dans le sillon où l’on se terrait ! Pas même le soulagement, la griserie de s’étourdir en lâchant des coups de fusil ; car tirer sur qui ? puisqu’on ne voyait toujours personne, à l’horizon vide !","And the formidable artillery duel continued, worsened, over the heads of the lying regiments, in the burning and gloomy countryside, where not a soul appeared, under the burning sun. There was only this thunder, this hurricane of destruction, rolling through this loneliness. The hours were going to pass, it would not stop. But already the superiority of the German artillery was indicated, the percussion shells almost all burst, at enormous distances; while the French rocket shells, of a much shorter flight, most often ignited in the air, before reaching their target. And no other resource than to make oneself very small, in the furrow where one was holed up! Not even the relief, the exhilaration of getting dazed by firing gunshots; because shoot who? since we still saw no one on the empty horizon!","The formidable artillery duel went on, getting steadily fiercer over the heads of the prostrate regiments in the baking and depressing country where there was not a soul to be seen in the blazing sun. Nothing but this thunder and hurricane of destruction rolling through the solitude. The hours were to pass one after another and it would never stop. Yet already the superiority of the German artillery was becoming clear, their percussion shells almost all went off at enormous distances, whereas the French ones with fuses had a much shorter range and most often exploded in the air before reaching the target. And no other resource was left but to make oneself as small as possible in the furrow where one was cowering! Not even the relief, the thrill of going off the deep-end and firing a rifle, for who was there to fire at since you still couldn’t see anybody on the empty horizon!","And still the tremendous artillery duel raged, and the death-dealing missiles went screaming over the recumbent ranks of the regiments that lay there on the sullen, sweltering plain, where no thing of life was to be seen beneath the blazing sun. The crashing thunder, the destroying hurricane, were masters in that solitude, and many long hours would pass before the end. But even thus early in the day the Germans had demonstrated the superiority of their artillery; their percussion shells had an enormous range, and exploded, with hardly an exception, on reaching their destination, while the French time-fuse shells, with a much shorter range, burst for the most part in the air and were wasted. And there was nothing left for the poor fellows exposed to that murderous fire save to hug the ground and make themselves as small as possible; they were even denied the privilege of firing in reply, which would have kept their mind occupied and given them a measure of relief; but upon whom or what were they to direct their rifles? since there was not a living soul to be seen upon the entire horizon! “Are we never to have a shot at them?"
"Mais Maurice, surtout, sentait l’angoisse l’étouffer, le long de la grand’route, par la campagne libre. Là, à mesure qu’on approchait de Belfort, la queue des fuyards se resserrait, n’était plus qu’un cortège ininterrompu. Ah ! les pauvres gens qui croyaient trouver un asile sous les murs de la place ! L’homme tapait sur le cheval, la femme suivait, traînant les enfants. Des familles se hâtaient, écrasées de fardeaux, débandées, les petits ne pouvant suivre, dans l’aveuglante blancheur du chemin que chauffait le soleil de plomb. Beaucoup avaient retiré leurs souliers, marchaient pieds nus, pour courir plus vite ; et des mères à moitié vêtues, sans cesser d’allonger le pas, donnaient le sein à des marmots en larmes. Les faces effarées se tournaient en arrière, les mains hagardes faisaient de grands gestes, comme pour fermer l’horizon, dans ce vent de panique qui échevelait les têtes et fouettait les vêtements attachés à la hâte. D’autres, des fermiers, avec tous leurs serviteurs, se jetaient à travers champs, poussaient devant eux les troupeaux lâchés, les moutons, les vaches, les bœufs, les chevaux, qu’on avait fait sortir à coups de bâton des étables et des écuries. Ceux-là gagnaient les gorges, les hauts plateaux, les forêts désertes, soulevant la poussière des grandes migrations, lorsque autrefois les peuples envahis cédaient la place aux barbares conquérants. Ils allaient vivre sous la tente, dans quelque cirque de rochers solitaires, si loin de tout chemin, que pas un soldat ennemi n’oserait s’y hasarder. Et les fumées volantes qui les enveloppaient, se perdaient derrière les bouquets de sapins, avec le bruit décroissant des beuglements et des sabots du bétail, tandis que, sur la route, le flot des voitures et des piétons passait toujours, gênant la marche des troupes, si compact aux approches de Belfort, d’un tel courant irrésistible de torrent élargi, que des haltes, à plusieurs reprises, devinrent nécessaires.","But Maurice, above all, felt his anguish suffocating him along the high road, through the open countryside. There, as they approached Belfort, the line of fugitives closed in, becoming nothing more than an uninterrupted procession. Ah! the poor people who thought they would find an asylum under the walls of the square! The man stamped on the horse, the woman followed, dragging the children. Families were hurrying along, crushed with burdens, disbanded, the little ones unable to follow, in the blinding whiteness of the path which was warmed by the blazing sun. Many had taken off their shoes, walked barefoot, to run faster; and half-dressed mothers, still striding along, suckled weeping brats. Frightened faces turned back, haggard hands made great gestures, as if to close the horizon, in this wind of panic which disheveled heads and whipped hastily tied clothes. Others, farmers, with all their servants, threw themselves across the fields, pushing in front of them the loose herds, the sheep, the cows, the oxen, the horses, which had been driven out of the stables with sticks and stables. These won the gorges, the high plateaus, the desert forests, raising the dust of the great migrations, when formerly the invaded peoples gave way to the conquering barbarians. They were going to live in a tent, in some circle of solitary rocks, so far from any path that no enemy soldier would dare to venture there. And the flying smoke that enveloped them, was lost behind the clumps of fir trees, with the decreasing noise of the bellows and the hoofs of the cattle, while, on the road, the stream of cars and pedestrians continued to pass, hindering the march of the troops. , so compact on the approaches to Belfort, of such an irresistible current of widened torrent, that halts, on several occasions, became necessary.","But it was above all along the main road in the open country that Maurice was choked with grief, for as they approached Belfort the straggle of refugees grew thicker and became an uninterrupted procession. Poor devils who thought they could find safety behind the walls of the fortress! The man belaboured his horse, the wife followed behind, dragging the children. Families pushed ahead, weighed down under their burdens, losing each other, tiny tots unable to keep up with the rest, and all in the blinding whiteness of the road on which the sun poured down like molten lead. Many had taken off their boots and were going barefoot so as to get along faster, and without slackening their pace half dressed mothers were giving the breast to whimpering babies. Scared faces glanced behind and hands gestured wildly as if to shut out the horizon as the wind of panic tousled heads and whipped up hastily put-on clothes. Others, farmers with all their labourers, marched straight across the fields, driving their flocks ahead – sheep, cows, oxen, horses that they had driven out of sheds and stables with their sticks. These were making for the deep valleys, the high plateaux and lonely forests, throwing up the dust-clouds of the great migrations of ancient times, when peoples abandoned their lands to the advancing, all-conquering barbarians. They were all going to live under canvas in some deserted rock fastness, so far from any road that not a single enemy soldier would dare risk his life there. The moving clouds enveloping them disappeared behind clumps of fir trees with the diminishing noise of lowing and trampling herds, whilst the stream of carts and people on foot still flowed along the road, upsetting the march of the troops, and on the outskirts of Belfort it became so concentrated, with its current as irresistible as a river in spate, that several times a halt had to be called.","But in the open country as they drew near Belfort, Maurice's heart was still more sorely wrung, for there the homeless fugitives were in greater numbers and lined the borders of the road in an unbroken cortege. Ah! the unhappy ones, who had believed that they were to find safety under the walls of the fortifications! The father lashed the poor old nag, the mother followed after, leading her crying children by the hand, and in this way entire families, sinking beneath the weight of their burdens, were strung along the white, blinding road in the fierce sunlight, where the tired little legs of the smaller children were unable to keep up with the headlong flight. Many had taken off their shoes and were going barefoot so as to get over the ground more rapidly, and half-dressed mothers gave the breast to their crying babies as they strode along. Affrighted faces turned for a look backward, trembling hands were raised as if to shut out the horizon from their sight, while the gale of panic tumbled their unkempt locks and sported with their ill-adjusted garments. Others there were, farmers and their men, who pushed straight across the fields, driving before them their flocks and herds, cows, oxen, sheep, horses, that they had driven with sticks and cudgels from their stables; these were seeking the shelter of the inaccessible forests, of the deep valleys and the lofty hill-tops, their course marked by clouds of dust, as in the great migrations of other days, when invaded nations made way before their barbarian conquerors. They were going to live in tents, in some lonely nook among the mountains, where the enemy would never venture to follow them; and the bleating and bellowing of the animals and the trampling of their hoofs upon the rocks grew fainter in the distance, and the golden nimbus that overhung them was lost to sight among the thick pines, while down in the road beneath the tide of vehicles and pedestrians was flowing still as strong as ever, blocking the passage of the troops, and as they drew near Belfort the men had to be brought to a halt again and again, so irresistible was the force of that torrent of humanity."
"D’un geste vacillant, par-dessus son épaule, il appelait quelqu’un, resté au fond de la salle.","With a wavering gesture, over his shoulder, he was calling someone from the back of the room.","He waved shakily backwards, summoning somebody still at the back of the room.","He turned unsteadily and called to someone who was invisible within the room: “Come here, you lazybones."
"Et ils se baisèrent, et comme dans le bois, la veille, il y avait, au fond de ce baiser, la fraternité des dangers courus ensemble, ces quelques semaines d’héroïque vie commune qui les avaient unis, plus étroitement que des années d’ordinaire amitié n’auraient pu le faire. Les jours sans pain, les nuits sans sommeil, les fatigues excessives, la mort toujours présente, passaient dans leur attendrissement. Est-ce que jamais deux cœurs peuvent se reprendre, quand le don de soi-même les a de la sorte fondus l’un dans l’autre ? Mais le baiser, échangé sous les ténèbres des arbres, était plein de l’espoir nouveau que la fuite leur ouvrait ; tandis que ce baiser, à cette heure, restait frissonnant des angoisses de l’adieu. Se reverrait-on, un jour ? et comment, dans quelles circonstances de douleur ou de joie ?","And they kissed each other, and as in the woods, the day before, there was, at the bottom of this kiss, the fraternity of the dangers run together, these few weeks of heroic life together which had united them, more closely than years of ordinary friendship could not have done it. The days without bread, the nights without sleep, the excessive fatigues, the ever present death, passed in their tenderness. Can two hearts ever recover, when the gift of oneself has melted them in this way? But the kiss, exchanged under the darkness of the trees, was full of the new hope that flight opened to them; while this kiss, at this hour, remained quivering with the anguish of farewell. Would we meet again one day? and how, in what circumstances of pain or joy?","They kissed each other, and as in the woods the day before there was in this kiss a brotherly love born of dangers shared, of these few weeks of heroic life in common which had united them more intimately than years of ordinary friendship could have done. Days without food, nights without sleep, exhaustion, ever-present death, all played a part in their affection. Can two hearts ever take themselves back again when a mutual gift has thus welded them to each other? But the kiss exchanged in the darkness among the trees had been full of the new hope opened up by escape, whereas this one now was full of the anguish of parting. Would they see each other again some day? And how, in what circumstances of grief or joy?","They embraced, and, as it had been in the wood the day before, that kiss set the seal to the brotherhood of dangers braved in each other's company, those few weeks of soldier's life in common that had served to bind their hearts together with closer ties than years of ordinary friendship could have done. Days of famine, sleepless nights, the fatigue of the weary march, death ever present to their eyes, these things made the foundation on which their affection rested. When two hearts have thus by mutual gift bestowed themselves the one upon the other and become fused and molten into one, is it possible ever to sever the connection? But the kiss they had exchanged the day before, among the darkling shadows of the forest, was replete with the joy of their new-found safety and the hope that their escape awakened in their bosom, while this was the kiss of parting, full of anguish and doubt unutterable. Would they meet again some day? and how, under what circumstances of sorrow or of gladness?"
"– Notre général… Vengeons-le, vengeons-le !","– Our general… let’s avenge him, let’s avenge him!","‘Our general! Revenge, revenge!’","“It is our general! Avenge him, avenge him!”"
"Pourtant, rien n’arrivait. Les hommes, toujours immobiles, l’arme au pied, n’avaient d’autre amusement que de regarder la belle ordonnance de la 2e division, rangée devant Floing, et dont la gauche, placée en potence, était tournée vers la Meuse, pour parer à une attaque de ce côté. Vers l’est, se déployait la 3e division, jusqu’au bois de la Garenne, en dessous d’Illy, tandis que la 1re, très entamée à Beaumont, se trouvait en seconde ligne. Pendant la nuit, le génie avait travaillé à des ouvrages de défense. Même, sous le feu commençant des Prussiens, on creusait encore des tranchées-abris, on élevait des épaulements.","Yet nothing was happening. The men, still motionless, their weapons at their feet, had no other amusement than to look at the fine orderly of the 2nd Division, ranged in front of Floing, and whose left, placed in a gallows, was turned towards the Meuse, to ward off an attack from that side. To the east, the 3rd Division was deployed, as far as the Bois de la Garenne, below Illy, while the 1st, badly attacked at Beaumont, was in the second line. During the night the engineers had worked on defense works. Even, under the beginning fire of the Prussians, shelter trenches were still being dug and shoulders being raised.","‘This is our turn.’ And yet nothing happened, the men were still just standing easy, and had nothing else to do except look at the fine arrangement of the second division drawn up in front of Floing with its left wing running at right-angles towards the Meuse to hold off an attack from that side. Eastwards the third division stretched as far as the Garenne woods below Illy, while the first, which had been very depleted at Beaumont, was a second line of defence. During the night the engineers had run up some defence works. Even now, under the opening fire of the Prussians, they were still making dug-outs and throwing up breastworks.","Nothing more startling occurred just then, however. The men, still preserving their formation and standing at ordered arms, found something to occupy their attention in the fine appearance made by the 2d division, posted in front of Floing, with their left refused and facing the Meuse, so as to guard against a possible attack from that quarter. The ground to the east, as far as the wood of la Garenne, beneath Illy village, was held by the 3d division, while the 1st, which had lost heavily at Beaumont, formed a second line. All night long the engineers had been busy with pick and shovel, and even after the Prussians had opened fire they were still digging away at their shelter trenches and throwing up epaulments."
"Maurice venait d’avoir un réveil accablé et frissonnant. Son pied, grâce aux larges chaussures, ne s’était pourtant plus enflammé. Mais le déluge de la veille, dont sa capote restait lourde, lui avait laissé une courbature dans tous les membres. Et, envoyé à la corvée de l’eau, pour le café, il regardait la plaine, à un bord de laquelle Boult-aux-Bois est situé : des forêts montent à l’ouest et au nord, une côte s’élève jusqu’au village de Belleville ; tandis que, vers Buzancy, à l’est, de vastes terrains plats s’étendent, avec de lentes ondulations, où se cachent des hameaux. Était-ce par là qu’on attendait l’ennemi ? Comme il revenait du ruisseau, rapportant le bidon plein, une famille de paysans éplorée, sur le seuil d’une petite ferme, l’appela, lui demanda si les soldats allaient rester enfin, pour les défendre. Déjà, à trois reprises, dans le va-et-vient des ordres contraires, le 5e corps avait traversé le pays. La veille, on avait entendu le canon, du côté de Bar. Certainement, les Prussiens n’étaient pas à plus de deux lieues. Et, lorsque Maurice eut répondu à ces pauvres gens que le 7e corps allait sans doute repartir, lui aussi, ils se lamentèrent. On les abandonnait, les soldats ne venaient donc pas pour se battre, qu’ils les voyaient reparaître et disparaître, toujours fuyants ?","Maurice had just woken up overwhelmed and shivering. His foot, thanks to the wide shoes, had however no longer been inflamed. But the deluge of the previous day, from which his greatcoat remained heavy, had left him with a soreness in all his limbs. And, sent to fetch water for coffee, he gazed at the plain, on one edge of which Boult-aux-Bois is situated: forests rise to the west and to the north, a hill rises to 'at the village of Belleville; while, towards Buzancy, to the east, vast flat lands extend, with slow undulations, where hamlets are hidden. Was this where the enemy was expected? As he was returning from the stream, bringing back a full can, a grieving family of peasants, on the threshold of a small farm, called him, asked him if the soldiers were going to stay at last, to defend them. Already, on three occasions, in the back and forth of contrary orders, the 5th Corps had crossed the country. The day before, we had heard the cannon, near Bar. Certainly, the Prussians were not more than two leagues away. And, when Maurice had replied to these poor people that the 7th Corps was no doubt going to leave, he too, they lamented. They were abandoned, so the soldiers did not come to fight, that they saw them reappear and disappear, always fleeing?","Maurice had woken up feeling depressed and nervous, though his foot was no longer inflamed thanks to the wide fitting boots. But after yesterday’s deluge his cape was still heavy with wet, and that had left him aching in every limb. On water fatigue for the coffee, he glanced over the plain on one edge of which Boult-aux-Bois is situated: forests rise up west and north and a ridge climbs up to the village of Belleville, whilst eastwards towards Buzancy are wide flat stretches of land with slight undulations in which hamlets nestle. Was that the direction from which the enemy was expected? On his way back from the stream with his canful of water he was hailed by a distressed family of peasants at their cottage door who asked him whether the soldiers were really going to stay this time and defend them. Three times already, acting on contradictory orders, the 5th corps had crossed and re-crossed their district. The day before they had heard gunfire in the direction of Bar. Certainly the Prussians were not more than two leagues away. When Maurice told these poor folk that the 7th corps was probably setting off too, they took it very badly. So they were being let down, so the soldiers didn’t come to fight, then, for they saw them appearing and disappearing, but always running away.","Maurice awoke to a sensation of despondency and physical discomfort. Thanks to his easy shoes the inflammation in his foot had gone down, but the drenching he had received the day before, from the effects of which his greatcoat seemed to weigh a ton, had left him with a distinct and separate ache in every bone of his body. When he was sent to the spring to get water for the coffee he took a survey of the plain on the edge of which Boult-aux-Bois is situated: forests rise to the west and north, and there is a hill crowned by the hamlet of Belleville, while, over to the east, Buzancy way, there is a broad, level expanse, stretching far as the eye can see, with an occasional shallow depression concealing a small cluster of cottages. Was it from that direction that they were to expect the enemy? As he was returning from the stream with his bucket filled with water, the father of a family of wretched peasants hailed him from the door of his hovel, and asked him if the soldiers were this time going to stay and defend them. In the confusion of conflicting orders the 5th corps had already traversed the region no less than three times. The sound of cannonading had reached them the day before from the direction of Bar; the Prussians could not be more than a couple of leagues away. And when Maurice made answer to the poor folks that doubtless the 7th corps would also be called away after a time, their tears flowed afresh. Then they were to be abandoned to the enemy, and the soldiers had not come there to fight, whom they saw constantly vanishing and reappearing, always on the run?"
"Elles rentrèrent toutes trois, elles se trouvèrent devant le major Bouroche qui avait déjà jeté dans un coin son uniforme, pour revêtir un grand tablier blanc. Sa tête énorme aux durs cheveux hérissés, son mufle de lion flambait de hâte et d’énergie, au-dessus de toute cette blancheur, encore sans tache. Et il leur apparut si terrible, qu’elles lui appartinrent du coup, obéissant à un signe, se bousculant pour le satisfaire.","They all three returned, they found themselves in front of Major Bouroche, who had already thrown his uniform into a corner to put on a large white apron. His huge head with hard bristling hair, his lion's muzzle flamed with haste and energy, above all this whiteness, still spotless. And he seemed so terrible to them that they suddenly belonged to him, obeying a sign, jostling to satisfy him.","All three went in and found themselves confronted by Major Bouroche, the medical officer, who had already thrown his uniform jacket into a corner and put on a big white apron. His huge head with coarse bristling hair and leonine face seemed flaming with urgency and energy above all this still unstained whiteness. He struck them as so terrible that they were instantly subjugated, obeying his every sign and rushing to satisfy him.","They all three hastened inside and found themselves in presence of Major Bouroche, who had thrown his uniform coat upon the floor, in a corner of the room, and donned a great white apron. Above the broad expanse of, as yet, unspotted white, his blazing, leonine eyes and enormous head, with shock of harsh, bristling hair, seemed to exhale energy and determination. So terrible did he appear to them that the women were his most humble servants from the very start, obedient to his every sign, treading on one another to anticipate his wishes."
"– Prenez garde ! il va se couper ! criait Delaherche. C’est dangereux, ôte-lui donc ça des mains !","– Take care! he's going to cut himself! shouted Delaherche. It's dangerous, so get it out of his hands!","‘Look out, he’ll cut himself!’ exclaimed Delaherche. ‘It’s dangerous, take it out of his hands.’",“Look out! he will cut himself!” Delaherche cried in alarm. “Take that thing away from him; it is dangerous!”
"– Sales bougres, sales bougres ! répéta-t-il, le poing tendu.","- Dirty buggers, dirty buggers! he repeated, his fist outstretched.","‘Filthy buggers! Filthy buggers!’ he repeated, shaking his fist.","“You dirty scoundrels, you dirty scoundrels!” he twice repeated, extending his clenched fist in impotent menace."
"Le sergent voulut passer outre, comme avait passé Bouroche. À quoi bon ? Puis, cédant à une impulsion de brave homme, il jeta des pièces sans compter, dans les deux mains déjà froides.","The sergeant wanted to pass on, as Bouroche had passed. What's the point ? Then, yielding to a brave man's impulse, he tossed coins without counting, into his two already cold hands.","The sergeant was for going on as Bouroche had. What was the point? But then an instinct of kindness prevailed, and without counting he threw some coins into the already cold hands.","The sergeant would have passed on and gone his way, as Bouroche had done. What good could money do there? Then yielding to a kindly impulse, he threw some coins, never stopping to count them, into the poor hands that were already cold."
"– Mais il n’est pas rentré, il ne rentrera que vers neuf heures, je pense… Pourquoi veux-tu qu’il rentre sitôt ?","""But he hasn't come home, he won't be home until about nine o'clock, I think. Why do you want him to come home so soon?""","‘But he hasn’t come back yet , he won’t before nine, I think. What makes you think he will come home so early?’","“Why, he has not returned; I don't look for him much before nine o'clock. What makes you so eager to see him at this hour of the morning?”"
"Et la vie se trouva ainsi comme dédoublée, dans la vaste maison noire de la rue Maqua. Tandis qu’aux repas Edmond, avec sa jolie figure de Chérubin blessé, répondait par monosyllabes au bavardage ininterrompu de Delaherche, en rougissant dès que Gilberte le priait de lui passer le sel, tandis que le soir M. de Gartlauben, les yeux pâmés, assis dans le cabinet de travail, écoutait une sonate de Mozart que la jeune femme jouait pour lui au fond du salon, la pièce voisine où vivaient le colonel de Vineuil et madame Delaherche restait silencieuse, les persiennes closes, la lampe éternellement allumée, ainsi qu’un tombeau éclairé par un cierge. Décembre avait enseveli la ville sous la neige, les nouvelles désespérées s’y étouffaient dans le grand froid. Après la défaite du général Ducrot à Champigny, après la perte d’Orléans, il ne restait plus qu’un sombre espoir, celui que la terre de France devînt la terre vengeresse, la terre exterminatrice, dévorant les vainqueurs. Que la neige tombât donc à flocons plus épais, que le sol se fendît sous les morsures de la gelée, pour que l’Allemagne entière y trouvât son tombeau ! Et une angoisse nouvelle serrait le cœur de madame Delaherche. Une nuit que son fils était absent, appelé en Belgique par ses affaires, elle avait entendu, en passant devant la chambre de Gilberte, un léger bruit de voix, des baisers étouffés, mêlés de rires. Saisie, elle était rentrée chez elle, dans l’épouvante de l’abomination qu’elle soupçonnait : ce ne pouvait être que le Prussien qui se trouvait là, elle croyait bien avoir remarqué déjà des regards d’intelligence, elle restait écrasée sous cette honte dernière. Ah ! cette femme que son fils avait amenée, malgré elle, dans la maison, cette femme de plaisir, à qui elle avait déjà pardonné une fois, en ne parlant pas, après la mort du capitaine Beaudoin ! Et cela recommençait, et c’était cette fois la pire infamie ! Qu’allait-elle faire ? une telle monstruosité ne pouvait continuer sous son toit. Le deuil de la réclusion où elle vivait en était accru, elle avait des journées d’affreux combat. Les jours où elle rentrait chez le colonel, plus sombre, muette pendant des heures, avec des larmes dans les yeux, il la regardait, il s’imaginait que la France venait de subir une défaite de plus.","And life thus seemed to be split in two, in the vast black house in the rue Maqua. While at meals Edmond, with his pretty face of a wounded Cherub, replied in monosyllables to Delaherche's uninterrupted chatter, blushing as soon as Gilberte begged him to pass the salt, while in the evening M. de Gartlauben, with swooning eyes, seated in the study, listening to a Mozart sonata that the young woman was playing for him at the back of the living room, the neighboring room where Colonel de Vineuil and Madame Delaherche lived remained silent, the shutters closed, the lamp eternally lit, as well as a tomb lit by a candle. December had buried the city in snow, the desperate news choking there in the bitter cold. After the defeat of General Ducrot at Champigny, after the loss of Orléans, there remained only a dark hope, that the land of France would become the avenging land, the exterminating land, devouring the victors. May the snow fall in thicker flakes, may the ground split under the bites of frost, so that the whole of Germany may find her tomb there! And a new anguish gripped Madame Delaherche's heart. One night when her son was away, called to Belgium on business, she had heard, as she passed Gilberte's room, the faint sound of voices, stifled kisses, mingled with laughter. Startled, she had gone home, terrified by the abomination she suspected: it could only be the Prussian who was there, she thought she had already noticed the glances of intelligence, she remained crushed under this last shame. Ah! this woman whom her son had brought, in spite of herself, into the house, this woman of pleasure, whom she had already pardoned once, by not speaking, after the death of Captain Beaudoin! And it started again, and this time it was the worst infamy! What was she going to do? such a monstrosity could not continue under its roof. The mourning of the confinement in which she lived was increased, she had days of terrible combat. The days when she returned to the colonel, more gloomy, mute for hours, with tears in her eyes, he looked at her, he imagined that France had just suffered one more defeat.","Thus there were, so to speak, two parallel existences in the huge dark house in the rue Maqua. Whereas at meal times Edmond, with his pretty face like a wounded cherub, answered Delaherche’s ceaseless prattle in monosyllables and blushed if Gilberte asked him to pass the salt, and in the evenings Captain von Gartlauben sat in the study listening with swimming eyes to a Mozart sonata she was playing for him in the drawing-room, the adjoining room in which Colonel de Vineuil and Madame Delaherche lived was always silent, with closed shutters, lamp eternally burning as though it were a tomb lit by a candle. December had buried the town in snow, and the dreadful news took second place in the intense cold. After the defeat of General Ducrot at Champigny and the loss of Orleans there was only one grim hope left, that the land of France itself would become the avenging land, the exterminating land devouring its own conquerors. Let the snow fall in ever thicker flakes, let the earth split open under blocks of ice and all Germany find its grave therein! Then a new anguish twisted old Madame Delaherche’s heart. One night when her son was called away into Belgium on business she had heard, as she passed Gilberte’s door, the sound of soft voices, stifled kisses and laughter. She went back to her own room horrified by the abomination she suspected. It could only be the Prussian in there; she had as a matter of fact thought she had noticed a certain understanding in the way they looked at each other, and she was stunned by this ultimate shame. Oh, this woman her son had brought into the home against her advice, this harlot whom she had already forgiven once, by holding her peace after Captain Beaudoin’s death! And it was all beginning again, and this time it was the lowest infamy! What should she do? Such a monstrous thing could not go on under her roof. The agony of the cloistered life she lived was made worse, and she had days of fearful struggle. On the days when she came into the colonel’s room sadder than ever and silent for hours, with tears in her eyes, he looked at her and imagined that France had suffered yet another defeat.","And thus it was that in the big, gloomy house in the Rue Maqua a twofold life went on. While at meal-times Edmond, the wounded cherub with the pretty face, lent a listening ear to Delaherche's unceasing chatter, blushing if ever Gilberte asked him to pass her the salt, while at evening M. de Gartlauben, seated in the study, with eyes upturned in silent ecstasy, listened to a sonata by Mozart performed for his benefit by the young woman in the adjoining drawing-room, a stillness as of death continued to pervade the apartment where Colonel de Vineuil and Madame Delaherche spent their days, the blinds tight drawn, the lamp continually burning, like a votive candle illuminating a tomb. December had come and wrapped the city in a winding-sheet of snow; the cruel news seemed all the bitterer for the piercing cold. After General Ducrot's repulse at Champigny, after the loss of Orleans, there was left but one dark, sullen hope: that the soil of France might avenge their defeat, exterminate and swallow up the victors. Let the snow fall thicker and thicker still, let the earth's crust crack and open under the biting frost, that in it the entire German nation might find a grave! And there came another sorrow to wring poor Madame Delaherche's heart. One night when her son was from home, having been suddenly called away to Belgium on business, chancing to pass Gilberte's door she heard within a low murmur of voices and smothered laughter. Disgusted and sick at heart she returned to her own room, where her horror of the abominable thing she suspected the existence of would not let her sleep: it could have been none other but the Prussian whose voice she heard; she had thought she had noticed glances of intelligence passing; she was prostrated by this supreme disgrace. Ah, that woman, that abandoned woman, whom her son had insisted on bringing to the house despite her commands and prayers, whom she had forgiven, by her silence, after Captain Beaudoin's death! And now the thing was repeated, and this time the infamy was even worse. What was she to do? Such an enormity must not go unpunished beneath her roof. Her mind was torn by the conflict that raged there, in her uncertainty as to the course she should pursue. The colonel, desiring to know nothing of what occurred outside his room, always checked her with a gesture when he thought she was about to give him any piece of news, and she had said nothing to him of the matter that had caused her such suffering; but on those days when she came to him with tears standing in her eyes and sat for hours in mournful silence, he would look at her and say to himself that France had sustained yet another defeat."
"– Je le tiens de ces bourgeois du conseil municipal, qui sont là-bas en permanence… Un officier était venu de la Sous-Préfecture leur tout dire.","– I got it from those bourgeois from the municipal council, who are there permanently… An officer had come from the Sub-Prefecture to tell them everything.",‘I had it from those gentry in the town council who are having a permanent session… An officer had come in from the Sub-Prefecture and told them all about it.’,"“I was told them by those fellows of the municipal council, who are in permanent session at the city hall. An officer had been dispatched from the Sous-Prefecture to lay the whole affair before them.”"
"Ils ne répondaient plus, ils sanglotaient entre leurs mains jointes. Et elle resta dans une anxiété atroce, sans faiblir, debout, les lèvres seulement agitées d’un petit frisson. Que devait-elle croire ? Elle avait beau se dire que l’enfant s’était trompée, elle voyait son mari en travers de la rue, la tête trouée d’une balle. Puis, c’était cette maison hermétiquement close qui l’inquiétait : pourquoi ? il ne s’y trouvait donc plus ? La certitude qu’il était tué lui glaça tout d’un coup le cœur. Mais peut-être n’était-il que blessé ; et le besoin d’aller là-bas, d’y être, la reprit si impérieusement, qu’elle aurait tenté encore de se frayer un passage, si, à cette minute, les clairons n’avaient sonné la marche en avant.","They weren't answering, they were sobbing into their clasped hands. And she remained in atrocious anxiety, without weakening, upright, the lips only agitated by a small shiver. What should she believe? In vain she told herself that the child had been mistaken, she saw her husband across the street, his head pierced by a bullet. Then, it was this hermetically sealed house that worried him: why? was he no longer there? The certainty that he was killed suddenly froze his heart. But maybe he was just hurt; and the need to go there, to be there, seized her so imperiously, that she would have tried again to force her way through, if, at that moment, the bugles had not sounded the march forward.","They made no further answer, but sobbed into their clasped hands. She stood there in atrocious anguish, firm, but her lips were quivering slightly. What was she to believe? However much she told herself that the child was mistaken, she could see her husband lying there in the street with a bullet-hole in his head. And then she was worried about this hermetically sealed house. Why? Wasn’t he still there, then? Suddenly the certainty that he had been killed struck a cold fear into her heart. But perhaps he was only wounded; and her need to go there and be there returned so inexorably that she would have tried once again to force a way through, there and then, if the bugles had not sounded the advance.","They made no answer, only continued to cover their face with their hands and sob. Her cruel anxiety, as she stood there erect, with no outward sign of weakness, was only evinced by a slight quivering of the lips. What was she to believe? Vainly she told herself the child was mistaken; her mental vision pictured her husband lying there dead before her in the street with a bullet wound in the head. Again, that house, so securely locked and bolted, was another source of alarm; why was it so? was he no longer in it? The conviction that he was dead sent an icy chill to her heart; but perhaps he was only wounded, perhaps he was breathing still; and so sudden and imperious was the need she felt of flying to his side that she would again have attempted to force her passage through the troops had not the bugles just then sounded the order for them to advance."
"Déjà, le général Bourgain-Desfeuilles s’éloignait, lorsque le général Douay, qui venait de recevoir un nouveau message, apporté par un hussard couvert de poussière, le rappela violemment.","Already, General Bourgain-Desfeuilles was leaving, when General Douay, who had just received a new message, brought by a dust-covered hussar, called him back violently.","General Bourgain-Desfeuilles was already moving off when General Douay, who had just received a new message delivered by a dust-stained hussar, recalled him in stentorian tones.","Bourgain-Desfeuilles had wheeled his horse and was moving away, when General Douay, to whom a grimy, dust-stained hussar had galloped up with another dispatch, excitedly summoned him back."
"– Vous savez, reprit Delaherche, que la teinturerie sera vigoureusement défendue… J’ai toute une section. Venez donc voir.","“You know,” resumed Delaherche, “that the dyeing will be vigorously defended. I have a whole section. Come and see.","‘You know,’ Delaherche went on, ‘the dyeworks will be strongly defended… I have a whole section. Come and look.’","“The dyehouse will be well defended,” said Delaherche. “I have a whole section in it. Come and see.”"
"Elle venait de songer que le fabricant de drap, lui aussi, avait couché à Bazeilles, et que, s’il était rentré, elle aurait par lui des nouvelles. Promptement, elle redescendit. Au lieu de sortir par la rue des Voyards, elle traversa l’étroite cour de la maison, elle prit le passage qui conduisait aux vastes bâtiments de la fabrique, dont la monumentale façade donnait sur la rue Maqua. Comme elle débouchait dans l’ancien jardin central, pavé maintenant, n’ayant gardé qu’une pelouse entourée d’arbres superbes, des ormes géants du dernier siècle, elle fut d’abord étonnée d’apercevoir, devant la porte fermée d’une remise, un factionnaire qui montait la garde ; puis, elle se souvint, elle avait su la veille que le trésor du 7e corps était déposé là ; et cela lui fit un singulier effet, tout cet or, des millions à ce qu’on disait, caché dans cette remise, pendant qu’on se tuait déjà, à l’entour. Mais, au moment où elle prenait l’escalier de service pour monter à la chambre de Gilberte, une autre surprise l’arrêta, une rencontre si imprévue, qu’elle en redescendit les trois marches déjà gravies, ne sachant plus si elle oserait aller frapper là-haut. Un soldat, un capitaine venait de passer devant elle, d’une légèreté d’apparition, aussitôt évanoui ; et elle avait eu pourtant le temps de le reconnaître, l’ayant vu à Charleville, chez Gilberte, lorsque celle-ci n’était encore que madame Maginot. Elle fit quelques pas dans la cour, leva les yeux sur les deux hautes fenêtres de la chambre à coucher, dont les persiennes restaient closes. Puis, elle se décida, elle monta quand même.","She had just thought that the cloth-maker had also slept at Bazeilles, and that if he had returned she would have news from him. Quickly, she came back down. Instead of going out by the rue des Voyards, she crossed the narrow courtyard of the house, she took the passage which led to the vast buildings of the factory, the monumental facade of which looked out on the rue Maqua. As she emerged into the old central garden, now paved, having only kept a lawn surrounded by superb trees, giant elms from the last century, she was at first surprised to see, in front of the closed door of a delivery, a sentry who stood guard; then, she remembered, she had known the day before that the treasure of the 7th corps was deposited there; and it had a singular effect on him, all that gold, millions, so it was said, hidden in that shed, while people were already killing each other all around. But, just as she was taking the back stairs to go up to Gilberte's bedroom, another surprise stopped her, a meeting so unexpected that she went back down the three steps she had already climbed, not knowing if she would dare to go. hit up there. A soldier, a captain had just passed in front of her, with the lightness of appearance, immediately fainted; and yet she had had time to recognize him, having seen him at Charleville, at Gilberte's, when the latter was still only Madame Maginot. She took a few steps in the yard, raised her eyes to the two high windows of the bedroom, the shutters of which remained closed. Then, she made up her mind, she went up anyway.","It had just occured to her that the mill-owner had slept at Bazeilles too, and that if he was back she would get news from him. She went downstairs again at once, but instead of going out by the rue des Voyards she crossed the narrow courtyard and took the passage leading to the huge factory buildings, the monumental frontage of which looked on to the rue Maqua. As she emerged into what was once the inner garden, now paved over except for a lawn surrounded by some superb trees, giant elms dating from the last century, she was at first surprised to see a sentry posted in front of the locked door of a coach-house, until she remembered that she had heard the day before that the cash of the 7th corps was deposited there, and it struck her as odd that all this gold, millions it was said, was hidden in this coach-house while they were already killing each other all round. But just as she was going up the service stairs to get to Gilberte’s room another surprise brought her to a standstill, such an unexpected encounter that she came down the three steps she had already climbed, wondering whether she dared to go up and knock. A soldier, a captain had crossed her path, swift as a vision, and vanished. Nevertheless she had had time to recognize him, having seen him in Charleville at Gilberte’s when she was still Madame Maginot. She walked about in the courtyard for a few moments, looked up at the two lofty windows of the bedroom, the shutters of which were still closed. Then she made up her mind and went up all the same.","It had just come to her recollection that the cloth manufacturer had also passed the night at Bazeilles, and if he had returned would be able to give her the intelligence she wanted. She ran swiftly down the stairs again. In place of taking the more roundabout way by the Rue des Voyards, she crossed the little courtyard of her house and entered the passage that conducted to the huge structure that fronted on the Rue Maqua. As she came out into the great central garden, paved with flagstones now and retaining of its pristine glories only a few venerable trees, magnificent century-old elms, she was astonished to see a sentry mounting guard at the door of a carriage-house; then it occurred to her that she had been told the day before that the camp chests of the 7th corps had been deposited there for safe keeping, and it produced a strange impression on her mind that all the gold, millions, it was said to amount to, should be lying in that shed while the men for whom it was destined were being killed not far away. As she was about to ascend the private staircase, however, that conducted to the apartment of Gilberte, young Madame Delaherche, she experienced another surprise in an encounter that startled her so that she retraced her steps a little way, doubtful whether it would not be better to abandon her intention, and go home again. An officer, a captain, had crossed her path, as noiselessly as a phantom and vanishing as swiftly, and yet she had had time to recognize him, having seen him in the past at Gilberte's house in Charleville, in the days when she was still Madame Maginot. She stepped back a few steps in the courtyard and raised her eyes to the two tall windows of the bedroom, the blinds of which were closed, then dismissed her scruples and entered."
"À cette minute, Jean se décidait à ouvrir doucement sa porte. Bien qu’il ne s’inquiétât jamais des bruits de la ferme, il finissait par être surpris des allées et venues, des éclats de voix qu’il entendait. Et ce fut chez lui, dans sa chambre calme, que Silvine vint s’abattre, échevelée, sanglotante, secouée d’une telle crise de détresse, qu’il ne put saisir d’abord ses paroles bégayées, coupées entre ses dents. Toujours elle répétait le même geste, comme pour écarter l’atroce vision. Enfin, il comprit, il vit à son tour le guet-apens, l’égorgement, la mère debout, le petit dans ses jupes, en face du père saigné à la gorge, dont le sang coulait ; et il en restait glacé, son cœur de paysan et de soldat chaviré d’angoisse. Ah ! la guerre, l’abominable guerre qui changeait tout ce pauvre monde en bêtes féroces, qui semait ces haines affreuses, le fils éclaboussé par le sang du père, perpétuant la querelle des races, grandissant plus tard dans l’exécration de cette famille paternelle, qu’il irait peut-être un jour exterminer ! Des semences scélérates pour d’effroyables moissons !","At that moment, Jean made up his mind to gently open his door. Although he never worried about the sounds of the farm, he ended up being surprised by the comings and goings, the outbursts of voices he heard. And it was at home, in his quiet room, that Silvine came down, disheveled, sobbing, shaken by such a crisis of distress that he could not at first catch her stammering words, cut between her teeth. Always she repeated the same gesture, as if to ward off the atrocious vision. Finally, he understood, he saw in his turn the ambush, the throat cut, the mother standing, the little one in his petticoats, opposite the father bleeding at the throat, whose blood was flowing; and he remained frozen, his heart of peasant and soldier overturned with anguish. Ah! the war, the abominable war which changed all these poor people into ferocious beasts, which sowed these frightful hatreds, the son splashed with the blood of the father, perpetuating the quarrel of the races, growing later in the execration of this paternal family, that he would perhaps one day exterminate! Wicked seeds for terrible harvests!","It was at that moment that Jean made up his mind to open the door of his room gently. Although he never bothered about the sounds in the house, he was surprised this time by the comings and goings and loud voices he heard. And so it was into his quiet room that Silvine tumbled sobbing and shaken in such a paroxysm of distress that at first he could not make any sense out of the disconnected words she muttered through clenched teeth. She kept repeating the same gesture, as though she were thrusting aside an atrocious vision. But at length he did understand, and he also pieced together the story of the ambush, the mother standing by, the child clinging to her skirt, the face of the father with his throat cut and life-blood ebbing away; it froze him, and the heart of this peasant and soldier was rent with anguish. Oh war, abominable war, that turned all these poor people into wild beasts, sowed dreadful hatreds, the son splashed with his father’s blood, perpetuating national hatred and doomed to grow up in time to execrate his father’s family, whom some day perhaps he would go and exterminate! Murderous seed sown to produce appalling harvests!","It was at this crisis that Jean rose from his bed and, softly opening his door, looked out into the passage. Although he generally gave but small attention to the various noises that reached him from the farmhouse, the unusual activity that prevailed this evening, the trampling of feet, the shouts and cries, in the end excited his curiosity. And it was to the retirement of his sequestered chamber that Silvine, sobbing and disheveled, came for shelter, her form convulsed by such a storm of anguish that at first he could not grasp the meaning of the rambling, inarticulate words that fell from her blanched lips. She kept constantly repeating the same terrified gesture, as if to thrust from before her eyes some hideous, haunting vision. At last he understood, the entire abominable scene was pictured clearly to his mind: the traitorous ambush, the slaughter, the mother, her little one clinging to her skirts, watching unmoved the murdered father, whose life-blood was slowly ebbing; and it froze his marrow—the peasant and the soldier was sick at heart with anguished horror. Ah, hateful, cruel war! that changed all those poor folks to ravening wolves, bespattering the child with the father's blood! An accursed sowing, to end in a harvest of blood and tears!"
"– Il n’y a pas à en douter. C’est à coup sûr l’idée du maréchal, qui est venu, cette nuit, nous dire de nous faire tuer jusqu’au dernier, plutôt que de laisser occuper le village.","– There is no doubt about it. This is certainly the idea of the marshal, who came last night to tell us to kill every last one of us rather than let the village be occupied.",‘No doubt about it. It’s obvious that that was in the marshal’s mind when he came last night to tell us to let ourselves be killed to the last man rather than allow the village to be occupied.’,"“There is not the slightest doubt of it. It is certainly the marshal's opinion, for he was here last night and told us that we must hold the village if it cost the life of every man of us.”"
– Qui donc ? demanda Jean.,- Who ? asked John.,‘Who?’ asked Jean.,“Of whom are you speaking?” asked Jean.
"Et il partit, et tous en effet le suivirent, tellement il avait dit cela en brave homme de père, qu’on ne pouvait abandonner, sans être des pas grand-chose. Lui seul, du reste, traversa tranquillement les champs nus, sur son grand cheval, tandis que les hommes s’éparpillaient, se jetaient en tirailleurs, profitant des moindres abris. Les terrains montaient, il y avait bien cinq cents mètres de chaumes et de carrés de betteraves, avant d’atteindre le calvaire. Au lieu de l’assaut classique, tel qu’il se passe dans les manœuvres, par lignes correctes, on ne vit bientôt que des dos arrondis qui filaient au ras de terre, des soldats isolés ou par petits groupes, rampant, sautant soudain ainsi que des insectes, gagnant la crête à force d’agilité et de ruse. Les batteries ennemies avaient dû les voir, les obus labouraient le sol, si fréquents, que les détonations ne cessaient point. Cinq hommes furent tués, un lieutenant eut le corps coupé en deux.","And he left, and indeed everyone followed him, so much had he said that like a good man of a father, that one could not give up without being nothing much. He alone, moreover, quietly crossed the bare fields on his big horse, while the men scattered, threw themselves like skirmishers, taking advantage of the slightest shelter. The ground rose, there were a good five hundred meters of stubble and squares of beets, before reaching the Calvary. Instead of the classic assault, such as occurs in maneuvers, by correct lines, one soon saw only rounded backs which sped along the ground, soldiers isolated or in small groups, crawling, suddenly jumping thus only insects, gaining the ridge by dint of agility and cunning. The enemy batteries must have seen them, the shells plowing the ground so frequently that the detonations did not cease. Five men were killed, a lieutenant had his body cut in two.","Off he dashed, and they all went after him, for he had said that in such a fatherly way that you couldn’t let him down unless you were a lot of shits. But he was the only one to cross the bare fields quite calmly, on his tall horse, while the men scattered and ducked like snipers, taking advantage of every bit of shelter. The land went uphill and there were a good five hundred metres of stubble and beet patches before the Calvary was reached. Instead of the classical assault as in manoeuvres, in straight lines, all that could soon be seen was humped backs creeping along on the ground, soldiers alone or in little groups crawling or suddenly jumping up like insects and reaching the top by dint of agility and subterfuge. The enemy batteries must have spotted them, for shells were raking the ground so often that the explosions never stopped. Five men were killed; a lieutenant had his body cut in two.","He turned his horse and left the trench, and they did all follow, to a man, for he would have been considered the lowest of the low who could have abandoned their leader after that brave, kind speech. He was the only one, however, who, while crossing the open fields, erect on his tall horse, was cool and unconcerned; the men scattered, advancing in open order and availing themselves of every shelter afforded by the ground. The land sloped upward; there were fully five hundred yards of stubble and beet fields between them and the Calvary, and in place of the correctly aligned columns that the spectator sees advancing when a charge is ordered in field maneuvers, all that was to be seen was a loose array of men with rounded backs, singly or in small groups, hugging the ground, now crawling warily a little way on hands and knees, now dashing forward for the next cover, like huge insects fighting their way upward to the crest by dint of agility and address. The enemy's batteries seemed to have become aware of the movement; their fire was so rapid that the reports of the guns were blended in one continuous roar. Five men were killed, a lieutenant was cut in two."
"Celui-ci le regardait, hébété, les yeux gros, l’estomac déchiré du même besoin.","He looked at him, dazed, his eyes wide, his stomach torn with the same need.","Jean was watching him dully, with goggling eyes, for his own stomach was tortured by the same desire.",The corporal was watching him with hungry eyes and a stupid expression on his face; his stomach was also twinging him.

"Mais le lieutenant Rochas rudoya le sergent Sapin, qu’il accusait de la mauvaise tenue de ses hommes.

"Delaherche venait justement de loger un commandant de cuirassiers, qui couchait avec ses bottes, et qui, en partant, avait laissé de l’ordure jusque sur la cheminée, lorsque, dans la seconde quinzaine de septembre, le capitaine de Gartlauben tomba chez lui, un soir de pluie diluvienne. La première heure fut assez rude. Il parlait haut, exigeait la plus belle chambre, faisait sonner son sabre sur les marches de l’escalier. Mais, ayant aperçu Gilberte, il devint correct, s’enferma, passa d’un air raide, en saluant poliment. Il était très adulé, car on n’ignorait pas qu’un mot de lui au colonel, qui commandait à Sedan, suffisait pour faire adoucir une réquisition ou relâcher un homme. Récemment, son oncle, le gouverneur général, à Reims, avait lancé une proclamation froidement féroce, décrétant l’état de siège et punissant de la peine de mort toute personne qui servirait l’ennemi, soit comme espion, soit en égarant les troupes allemandes qu’elles seraient chargées de conduire, soit en détruisant les ponts et les canons, en endommageant les lignes télégraphiques et les chemins de fer. L’ennemi, c’étaient les Français ; et le cœur des habitants bondissait, en lisant la grande affiche blanche, collée à la porte de la commandature, qui leur faisait un crime de leur angoisse et de leurs vœux. Il était si dur déjà d’apprendre les nouvelles victoires des armées allemandes par les hourras de la garnison ! Chaque journée amenait ainsi son deuil, les soldats allumaient de grands feux, chantaient, se grisaient, la nuit entière, tandis que les habitants, forcés désormais de rentrer à neuf heures, écoutaient du fond de leurs maisons noires, éperdus d’incertitude, devinant un nouveau malheur. Ce fut même dans une de ces circonstances, vers le milieu d’octobre, que M. de Gartlauben fit, pour la première fois, preuve de quelque délicatesse. Depuis le matin, Sedan renaissait à l’espérance, le bruit courait d’un grand succès de l’armée de la Loire, en marche pour délivrer Paris. Mais, tant de fois déjà, les meilleures nouvelles s’étaient changées en messagères de désastres ! Et, dès le soir, en effet, on apprenait que l’armée bavaroise s’était emparée d’Orléans. Rue Maqua, dans une maison qui faisait face à la fabrique, des soldats braillèrent si fort, que le capitaine, ayant vu Gilberte très émue, alla les faire taire, en trouvant lui-même ce tapage déplacé.","Delaherche had just lodged a commandant of cuirassiers, who slept with his boots on, and who, on leaving, had left garbage even on the chimney, when, in the second half of September, Captain de Gartlauben fell at his house, an evening of torrential rain. The first hour was pretty tough. He spoke loudly, demanded the finest room, rang his saber on the steps of the stairs. But, having seen Gilberte, he became correct, shut himself up, passed with a stiff air, bowing politely. He was much adored, because it was well known that a word from him to the colonel, who was in command at Sedan, was enough to have a requisition softened or a man released. Recently, his uncle, the Governor General, in Reims, had issued a coldly fierce proclamation, declaring a state of siege and punishing with the death penalty any person who served the enemy, either as a spy or by leading German troops astray. that they would be responsible for leading, either by destroying bridges and cannons, by damaging telegraph lines and railways. The enemy was the French; and the hearts of the inhabitants leaped as they read the large white poster, stuck to the door of the commandature, which made them a crime of their anguish and their wishes. It was so hard already to learn of the new victories of the German armies from the cheers of the garrison! Each day thus brought its mourning, the soldiers lit big fires, sang, got drunk, the whole night, while the inhabitants, now forced to return at nine o'clock, listened from the depths of their dark houses, wild with uncertainty, guessing a new misfortune. It was even under one of these circumstances, towards the middle of October, that M. de Gartlauben for the first time gave proof of some delicacy. Since morning, Sedan had been reborn with hope, the rumor was circulating of a great success of the army of the Loire, marching to deliver Paris. But, so many times already, the best news had changed into messengers of disaster! And, in the evening, in fact, we learned that the Bavarian army had taken Orleans. In the Rue Maqua, in a house which faced the factory, soldiers bawled so loudly that the captain, having seen Gilberte very moved, went and silenced them, finding the uproar himself out of place.","Delaherche had just had to have a commanding officer in the cavalry who slept in his boots and left behind filth even on the mantelpiece, when Captain von Gartlauben arrived in his house one pouring wet night in the second half of September. The first hour was pretty rough. He talked at the top of his voice, demanded the best room, clanking his sword as he came up the stairs. But once he saw Gilberte he went very formal, shut himself up in his room, passed people stiffly and bowed politely. He lived in constant adulation because everyone knew that a word from him to the colonel in command at Sedan would be enough to get a requisition mitigated or a man released. Recently his uncle, the Governor-General at Rheims, had issued a coldly ferocious proclamation declaring a state of siege and punishing with the death penalty any person helping the enemy, whether as a spy or by causing German troops to take the wrong route when they were responsible for transporting them, or by destroying bridges and cannon or damaging telegraph wires and railways. The enemy meant the French, and the hearts of the people were outraged when they read the big white poster on the door of the headquarters which made a crime out of their anguish and hopes. It was so hard to learn about fresh victories of the Germans through hurrahs from the garrison! Every day brought its own grief, soldiers lit big bonfires, sang and caroused all through the night, while the population, now forced to be indoors by nine, listened in their darkened houses, beside themselves with uncertainty and guessing it meant yet another disaster. It was in one of these situations, towards mid October, that Captain von Gartlauben showed the first sign of some delicacy of mind. Since that morning a new hope had been born in Sedan, for there was a rumour of a great success for the army of the Loire on its way to relieve Paris. But so many times already the best news had turned into tidings of disaster! And indeed by that evening it was known that the Bavarian army had taken Orleans. In the rue Maqua, in a house opposite the mill, some soldiers were bellowing so loud that the captain, seeing Gilberte looking very upset, went and stopped them, for he himself thought that all this row was uncalled for.","Delaherche had just had an experience with a lodger who had been quartered on him, a captain of cuirassiers, who made a practice of going to bed with his boots on and when he went away left his apartment in an unmentionably filthy condition, when in the last half of September Captain de Gartlauben came to his door one evening when it was raining in torrents. The first hour he was there did not promise well for the pleasantness of their future relations; he carried matters with a high hand, insisting that he should be given the best bedroom, trailing the scabbard of his sword noisily up the marble staircase; but encountering Gilberte in the corridor he drew in his horns, bowed politely, and passed stiffly on. He was courted with great obsequiousness, for everyone was well aware that a word from him to the colonel commanding the post of Sedan would suffice to mitigate a requisition or secure the release of a friend or relative. It was not very long since his uncle, the governor-general at Rheims, had promulgated a particularly detestable and cold-blooded order, proclaiming martial law and decreeing the penalty of death to whomsoever should give aid and comfort to the enemy, whether by acting for them as a spy, by leading astray German troops that had been entrusted to their guidance, by destroying bridges and artillery, or by damaging the railroads and telegraph lines. The enemy meant the French, of course, and the citizens scowled and involuntarily doubled their fists as they read the great white placard nailed against the door of post headquarters which attributed to them as a crime their best and most sacred aspirations. It was so hard, too, to have to receive their intelligence of German victories through the cheering of the garrison! Hardly a day passed over their heads that they were spared this bitter humiliation; the soldiers would light great fires and sit around them, feasting and drinking all night long, while the townspeople, who were not allowed to be in the streets after nine o'clock, listened to the tumult from the depths of their darkened houses, crazed with suspense, wondering what new catastrophe had befallen. It was on one of these occasions, somewhere about the middle of October, that M. de Gartlauben for the first time proved himself to be possessed of some delicacy of feeling. Sedan had been jubilant all that day with renewed hopes, for there was a rumor that the army of the Loire, then marching to the relief of Paris, had gained a great victory; but how many times before had the best of news been converted into tidings of disaster! and sure enough, early in the evening it became known for certain that the Bavarians had taken Orleans. Some soldiers had collected in a house across the way from the factory in the Rue Maqua, and were so boisterous in their rejoicings that the Captain, noticing Gilberte's annoyance, went and silenced them, remarking that he himself thought their uproar ill-timed."
"– Ah ! ce qu’il me scie les pattes, le flingot ! reprit Loubet, en changeant une fois encore son fusil d’épaule. En voilà un mirliton, pour se promener !","– Ah! what he saws off my legs, the gun! resumed Loubet, once more changing his tune. Here is a kazoo, to walk around!","‘Oh this rifle’s sawing off my paws!’ Loubet went on, once again changing shoulders, ‘and there’s a bleeding tin whistle that can go for a walk!’","“This confounded blunderbuss must weigh a ton, I think,” Loubet went on. “This is fine music to march by!”"
"– Mon Dieu ! que je meure avant la fin !… Je n’entends pas le canon. Pourquoi ne tire-t-on plus ?… Là-haut, à Saint-Menges, à Fleigneux, nous commandons toutes les routes, nous jetterons les Prussiens à la Meuse, s’ils veulent tourner Sedan pour nous attaquer. La ville est à nos pieds, ainsi qu’un obstacle, qui renforce encore nos positions… En marche ! le 7e corps prendra la tête, le 12e protégera la retraite…","- My God ! let me die before the end!... I do not hear the cannon. Why aren't they firing any more?... Up there, at Saint-Menges, at Fleigneux, we command all the roads, we will throw the Prussians into the Meuse, if they want to turn Sedan to attack us.

Why have they stopped firing? … Up there at Saint-Menges and Fleigneux we’re commanding all the routes, and we’ll throw the Prussians into the Meuse if they try to come round Sedan and attack us. The town is at our feet like an obstacle strengthening our positions… Come on the 7th! We’ll take the lead, the 12th will cover the retreat…’","“Merciful God, let me die before the end! I do not hear the guns. Why have they ceased firing? Up there at Saint-Menges, at Fleigneux, we have command of all the roads; should the Prussians dare turn Sedan and attack us, we will drive them into the Meuse. The city is there, an insurmountable obstacle between us and them; our positions, too, are the stronger. Forward! the 7th corps will lead, the 12th will protect the retreat—”"
"Le canon tonnait depuis six heures. En montant sur un coteau, il avait eu deux camarades tués par un obus, à côté de lui ; et, plus loin, trois autres encore étaient restés par terre, la peau trouée de balles, sans qu’on pût savoir d’où elles venaient. C’était exaspérant, cette promenade militaire, inutile et dangereuse, au travers du champ de bataille. Enfin, vers une heure, il comprit qu’on se décidait à les faire tuer au moins proprement. Toute la division Margueritte, trois régiments de chasseurs d’Afrique, un de chasseurs de France et un de hussards, venait d’être réunie dans un pli de terrain, un peu au-dessous du calvaire, à gauche de la route. Les trompettes avaient sonné « Pied à terre ! » Et le commandement des officiers retentit :","The cannon had been thundering for six hours. Climbing up a hill, he had had two comrades killed by a shell beside him; and, further on, three others still remained on the ground, their skin riddled with bullets, without anyone knowing where they came from. It was exasperating, this military walk, useless and dangerous, through the battlefield. Finally, around one o'clock, he understood that they had decided to have them killed, at least properly. The whole of Margueritte's division, three regiments of chasseurs d'Afrique, one of chasseurs de France, and one of hussars, had just been united in a bend in the ground, a little below the Calvary, to the left of the road. The trumpets had sounded ""Pied à terre!"" And the command of the officers rang out:","The guns had been roaring for six hours. As they went up a hill he had had two comrades killed at his side by a shell, and a bit further on three others were left on the ground riddled with bullets coming from nobody knew where. It was exasperating to be out on this useless and dangerous military parade across the battlefield. Finally at about one he realized that they had at any rate made up their minds to have them killed decently. The whole Margueritte division, three regiments of Chasseurs d’Afrique, one of French and one of hussars, had been asembled in a dip of the land slightly below the Calvary, to the left of the road. The trumpets had sounded dismount. And the officers’ command rang out:","For six hours the cannon had been thundering. As they climbed a hill two comrades, riding at his side, had been struck down by a shell, and as they rode onward seven or eight others had bit the dust, pierced by rifle-balls that came no one could say whence. It was becoming tiresome, that slow parade, as useless as it was dangerous, up and down the battlefield. At last—it was about one o'clock—he learned that it had been decided they were to be killed off in a somewhat more decent manner. Margueritte's entire division, comprising three regiments of chasseurs d'Afrique, one of chasseurs de France, and one of hussars, had been drawn in and posted in a shallow valley a little to the south of the Calvary of Illy. The trumpets had sounded: “Dismount!” and then the officers' command ran down the line to tighten girths and look to packs."
"Il balançait son fusil, d’une main rageuse. Puis, violemment, il le lança aussi de l’autre côté d’une haie.","He swung his rifle with an angry hand. Then, violently, he also threw it across a hedge.","He swung his rifle impatiently, then he too flung it violently over the hedge.","And now the officers are going to let the Prussians knock us about as they please, and we're dished and done for.” He had been swinging his piece to and fro in his hand; in his discouragement he gave it a toss and landed it on the other side of the hedge."

"Alors, Delaherche, qui n’avait cessé d’appeler Weiss, demanda une dernière fois :","Then Delaherche, who had been calling Weiss incessantly, asked one last time:","Delaherche, who had never stopped calling to Weiss, asked for the last time:","Then Delaherche, who all this time had been frantically shouting to Weiss without intermission, addressed him one last appeal:"
"Jean avait toujours son idée. Il venait bien de trouver là toute une flottille de petites barques. Mais elles étaient enchaînées, comment en détacher une, dégager les rames ? Enfin, il découvrit une vieille paire de rames, il put forcer un cadenas, mal fermé sans doute ; et, tout de suite, lorsqu’il eut couché Maurice à l’avant du canot, il s’abandonna avec prudence au fil du courant, longeant le bord, dans l’ombre des bains froids et des péniches. Ni l’un ni l’autre ne parlaient plus, épouvantés de l’exécrable spectacle qui se déroulait. À mesure qu’ils descendaient la rivière, l’horreur semblait grandir, dans le recul de l’horizon. Quand ils furent au pont de Solférino, ils virent d’un regard les deux quais en flammes.","Jean always had his idea. He had just found a whole flotilla of small boats there. But they were chained, how to detach one, free the oars? Finally, he discovered an old pair of oars, he was able to force a padlock, no doubt badly closed; and immediately, when he had laid Maurice down in the bow of the canoe, he abandoned himself cautiously to the course of the current, skirting the edge, in the shade of the cold baths and the barges. Neither one nor the other spoke any more, terrified by the execrable spectacle which was unfolding. As they descended the river, the horror seemed to grow, in the retreat of the horizon. When they were at the Solferino bridge, they saw at a glance the two quays in flames.","Jean still stuck to his idea. He had found a whole flotilla of small boats. But they were chained up, and how could he free one and get the oars out? But in the end he did manage to find an old pair of oars and was able to force a padlock – not properly locked, no doubt – and having laid Maurice in the bows he at once cautiously let himself drift with the current, hugging the bank in the shadow of the bathing establishment and barges. Neither said a word, for they were appalled by the dreadful spectacle unfolding itself. As they went downstream the horror seemed to get worse and the horizon receded. When they reached the Solferino bridge they could take in at a glance both banks in flames.","Jean was still harboring his idea. He had found quite a flotilla of small boats there, but they were all securely fastened with chains; how was he to get one loose and secure a pair of oars? At last he discovered two oars that had been thrown aside as useless; he succeeded in forcing a padlock, and when he had stowed Maurice away in the bow, shoved off and allowed the boat to drift with the current, cautiously hugging the shore and keeping in the shadow of the bathing-houses. Neither of them spoke a word, horror-stricken as they were by the baleful spectacle that presented itself to their vision. As they floated down the stream and their horizon widened the enormity of the terrible sight increased, and when they reached the bridge of Solferino a single glance sufficed to embrace both the blazing quais."

"Cependant, Maurice qui examinait de près le sergent, avec surprise, finit par lui demander :","However, Maurice, who was watching the sergeant closely, with surprise, ended up asking him:","By now Maurice had had a close look at the sergeant, which gave him a shock, and now he asked:",Meantime Maurice had stepped up and taken a closer look at the sergeant; he finally asked him:
"Lorsque Maurice ramena Henriette, ils surprirent le père Fouchard en train d’examiner soigneusement le cheval, que Prosper venait de conduire à l’écurie. Une bête fatiguée, mais diablement solide, et qui lui plaisait ! En riant, le jeune homme dit qu’il lui en faisait cadeau. Henriette, de son côté, le prit à part, lui expliqua que Jean payerait, qu’elle-même se chargeait de lui, qu’elle le soignerait dans la petite chambre, derrière l’étable, où certes pas un Prussien n’irait le chercher. Et le père Fouchard, maussade, mal convaincu encore qu’il trouverait au fond de tout ça un vrai bénéfice, finit cependant par monter dans sa carriole et par s’en aller, en la laissant libre d’agir à sa guise.","When Maurice brought Henriette back, they overheard Father Fouchard carefully examining the horse, which Prosper had just led to the stable. A tired animal, but devilishly solid, and which he liked! Laughing, the young man said he gave it to her. Henriette, for her part, took him aside, explained to him that Jean would pay, that she would take care of him herself, that she would look after him in the little room, behind the stable, where certainly no Prussian would go. look for it. And Father Fouchard, sullen, still unconvinced that he would find a real benefit in all this, ended up getting into his cart and leaving, leaving her free to do as she pleased.","When Maurice brought back Henriette they caught old Fouchard carefully looking over the horse that Prosper had taken to the stable. A very tired animal, but jolly strong, and he liked the look of it! The young man laughed as he said he would make him a present of it. Henriette meanwhile took her uncle to one side and explained that Jean would pay, and that she would look after him in her little room behind the cowshed where certainly no Prussian would ever go and look for him. Old Fouchard, sulking and still unconvinced that there would be any real profit for him in all this, did eventually jump into his cart and go off, leaving her to do as she thought fit.","When Maurice returned with Henriette they caught the old man making a critical examination of the horse, that Prosper had led away to the stable. The animal seemed to please him; he was knocked up, but showed signs of strength and endurance. The young man laughed and told his uncle he might have him as a gift if he fancied him, while Henriette, taking her relative aside, assured him Jean should be no expense to him; that she would take charge of him and nurse him, and he might have the little room behind the cow-stables, where no Prussian would ever think to look for him. And Father Fouchard, still wearing a very sulky face and but half convinced that there was anything to be made out of the affair, finally closed the discussion by jumping into his carriole and driving off, leaving her at liberty to act as she pleased."
"Brusquement, Prosper, dont le cœur de vieux chasseur d’Afrique battait à se rompre, de rage étouffée, poussa du coude Silvine, en lui montrant deux soldats qui passaient. Il avait reconnu Maurice et Jean, emmenés avec les camarades, marchant fraternellement côte à côte ; et, la petite charrette, enfin, ayant repris sa marche derrière le convoi, il put les suivre du regard jusqu’au faubourg de Torcy, sur cette route plate qui conduit à Iges, au milieu des jardins et des cultures maraîchères.","Suddenly Prosper, whose old African hunter's heart was beating wildly with stifled rage, nudged Silvine, pointing to two passing soldiers. He had recognized Maurice and Jean, led away with their comrades, walking fraternally side by side; and, the little cart, at last, having resumed its march behind the convoy, he was able to follow them with his gaze as far as the Faubourg de Torcy, on this flat road which leads to Iges, in the midst of gardens and market gardens.","Prosper, as a veteran African campaigner, felt his heart thumping with helpless rage. Suddenly he nudged Silvine and pointed at two of the passing soldiers. He had recognized Maurice and Jean being taken off with the rest, walking side by side like two brothers, and when the little cart started up again at the tail of the convoy he was able to follow them with his eye as far as Torcy, on the flat road leading to Iges through gardens and small-holdings.","All at once Prosper, whose heart was beating as if it would burst his bosom with repressed sorrow and indignation, nudged Silvine and called her attention to two soldiers who were passing at the moment. He had recognized Maurice and Jean, trudging along with their companions, like brothers, side by side. They were near the end of the line, and as there was now no impediment in their way, he was enabled to keep them in view as far as the Faubourg of Torcy, as they traversed the level road which leads to Iges between gardens and truck farms."
"Mais, comme il se dirigeait vers l’échelle, une balle l’atteignit dans l’aine et le renversa.","But, as he was heading for the ladder, a bullet hit him in the groin and knocked him down.",But as he was making for the ladder a bullet got him in the groin and knocked him backwards.,But as he was making for the ladder a bullet struck him in the groin and he fell.

"C’était vrai, il avait gardé précieusement trois biscuits, pour le cas où l’on se battrait, sachant qu’on a très faim sur les champs de bataille. D’ailleurs, il venait de manger une pomme de terre. Ça lui suffisait. On verrait plus tard.","It was true, he had treasured three biscuits, in case we fought, knowing that we are very hungry on the battlefields. Besides, he had just eaten a potato. That was enough for him. We'll see later.","It was true, he had treasured three biscuits in case there was any fighting, knowing you can get terribly hungry on a battlefield. Anyhow he had just had a potato. That’d do for him. See later on.","It was true; he had carefully put aside three biscuits, in case there should be a fight, knowing that men are often hungry on the battlefield. And then, besides, he had just eaten a potato; that would be sufficient for him. Perhaps something would turn up later on."
"– Tout de même, reprit-il, ça me fait de la peine pour l’empereur… Les affaires avaient l’air de marcher, le blé se vendait bien… Mais sûrement qu’il a été trop bête, on ne se fourre pas dans des histoires pareilles !","“All the same,” he went on, “I feel sorry for the Emperor… Business seemed to be going well, the wheat was selling well… But surely he was too stupid, we don't cheat in such stories!","‘All the same,’ he went on, ‘I feel sorry for the Emperor… Things looked as if they were going well and corn was selling. But he has been too stupid, that’s certain, and people shouldn’t get themselves into such a mess.’","“All the same, though,” he continued, “I am sorry for the Emperor. Affairs seemed to be going on well; the farmers were getting a good price for their grain. But surely it was bad judgment on his part to allow himself to become involved in this business!”"

"Ce fut, pour Maurice, une soirée d’affreuse tristesse. Si les Allemands avaient osé, ils auraient campé la nuit sur la place du Carrousel. Mais c’étaient des gens d’absolue prudence, résolus à un siège classique, ayant réglé déjà les points exacts de l’investissement, le cordon de l’armée de la Meuse au nord, de Croissy à la Marne, en passant par Épinay, l’autre cordon de la troisième armée au midi, de Chennevières à Châtillon et à Bougival, pendant que le grand quartier prussien, le roi Guillaume, M. de Bismarck et le général de Moltke régnaient à Versailles. Ce blocus géant, auquel on ne croyait pas, était un fait accompli. Cette ville, avec son enceinte bastionnée de huit lieues et demie de tour, avec ses quinze forts et ses six redoutes détachées, allait se trouver comme en prison. Et l’armée de défense ne comptait que le 13e corps, sauvé et ramené par le général Vinoy, le 14e en voie de formation, confié au général Ducrot, réunissant à eux deux un effectif de quatre-vingt mille soldats, auxquels il fallait ajouter les quatorze mille hommes de la marine, les quinze mille des corps francs, les cent quinze mille de la garde mobile, sans parler des trois cent mille gardes nationaux, répartis dans les neuf secteurs des remparts. S’il y avait là tout un peuple, les soldats aguerris et disciplinés manquaient. On équipait les hommes, on les exerçait, Paris n’était plus qu’un immense camp retranché. Les préparatifs de défense s’enfiévraient d’heure en heure, les routes coupées, les maisons de la zone militaire rasées, les deux cents canons de gros calibre et les deux mille cinq cents autres pièces utilisées, d’autres canons fondus, tout un arsenal sortant du sol, sous le grand effort patriotique du ministre Dorian. Après la rupture des négociations de Ferrières, lorsque Jules Favre eut fait connaître les exigences de M. de Bismarck, la cession de l’Alsace, la garnison de Strasbourg prisonnière, trois milliards d’indemnité, un cri de colère s’éleva, la continuation de la guerre, la résistance fut acclamée, comme une condition indispensable à la vie de la France. Même sans espoir de vaincre, Paris devait se défendre, pour que la patrie vécût.","It was an evening of terrible sadness for Maurice. If the Germans had dared, they would have camped overnight on the Place du Carrousel. But they were people of absolute caution, resolved on a classic siege, having already settled the exact points of the investment, the cordon of the army from the Meuse to the north, from Croissy to the Marne, passing through Épinay. , the other cordon of the third army to the south, from Chennevières to Châtillon and Bougival, while the great Prussian quarter, King William, M. de Bismarck and General de Moltke reigned at Versailles. This giant blockade, which no one believed in, was a fait accompli. This city, with its bastioned enclosure eight and a half leagues in circumference, with its fifteen forts and its six detached redoubts, was about to find itself as though in a prison. And the army of defense consisted of only the 13th corps, saved and brought back by General Vinoy, the 14th in the process of being formed, entrusted to General Ducrot, bringing together between them a workforce of eighty thousand soldiers, to which it was necessary to add the fourteen thousand men of the Navy, the fifteen thousand of the Freikorps, the one hundred and fifteen thousand of the Mobile Guard, not to mention the three hundred thousand National Guards, distributed among the nine sectors of the ramparts. If there was a whole people there, seasoned and disciplined soldiers were lacking. We equipped the men, we trained them, Paris was nothing more than an immense entrenched camp. The preparations for defense grew feverish hour by hour, the roads cut off, the houses in the military zone razed to the ground, the two hundred large-caliber guns and the two thousand five hundred other pieces used, other guns melted down, a whole arsenal emerging from the ground, under the great patriotic effort of Minister Dorian. After the breakdown of the Ferrières negotiations, when Jules Favre had made known the demands of M. de Bismarck, the cession of Alsace, the prisoner garrison of Strasbourg, three billions in indemnity, a cry of anger arose, the continuation of the war, resistance was acclaimed as an indispensable condition for the life of France. Even without hope of victory, Paris had to defend itself, so that the fatherland would live.","It was an evening of terrible distress for Maurice. If the Germans had dared, they could have camped that night in the Place du Carrousel. But they were strictly prudent people, resolved to have a siege according to the rules, and they had already plotted the exact points of investment, with the cordon of the army of the Meuse to the north from Croissy to the Marne, passing through Epinay, and the other cordon of the third army to the south from Chennevières to Châtillon and Bougival, while the Prussian General Headquarters, with King William, Bismarck and von Moltke, controlled everything from Versailles. This gigantic blockade, believed to be impossible, was an accomplished fact. This city, with its bastioned wall eight and a half leagues in circumference, with its fifteen forts and six detached redoubts, was about to find itself so to speak in prison. The defending army consisted only of the 13th corps, rescued and brought back by General Vinoy, and the 14th, still being formed under General Ducrot, making between them a strength of eighty thousand soldiers, to which should be added the fourteen thousand marines, fifteen thousand volunteers, a hundred and fifteen thousand militia, apart from the three hundred thousand National Guards spread over the nine sectors of the ramparts. There might well be a whole people under arms, but there was a lack of seasoned and disciplined soldiers. Men were being equipped and drilled, and Paris was one huge armed camp. Preparations for defence grew more feverish hour by hour, roads were closed, houses in the military zone demolished, the two hundred heavy-calibre guns and the two thousand smaller ones all in use, with others being cast, a whole arsenal was rising out of the ground thanks to the great patriotic inspiration of the minister, Dorian. After the breaking off of negotiations at Ferrières when Jules Favre had made known the demands of Bismarck – cession of Alsace, internment of the garrison at Strasbourg, indemnity of three milliards – a howl of rage went up and the continuation of the war and resistance were acclaimed as indispensable conditions of the survival of France. Even with no hope of victory Paris had to defend herself so that the homeland might live.","The condition of their affairs caused Maurice a terrible dejection. Had the Germans been more enterprising they might have pitched their tents that night in the Place du Carrousel, but with the prudence of their race they had determined that the siege should be conducted according to rule and precept, and had already fixed upon the exact lines of investment, the position of the army of the Meuse being at the north, stretching from Croissy to the Marne, through Epinay, the cordon of the third army at the south, from Chennevieres to Chatillon and Bougival, while general headquarters, with King William, Bismarck, and General von Moltke, were established at Versailles. The gigantic blockade, that no one believed could be successfully completed, was an accomplished fact; the city, with its girdle of fortifications eight leagues and a half in length, embracing fifteen forts and six detached redoubts, was henceforth to be transformed into a huge prison-pen. And the army of the defenders comprised only the 13th corps, commanded by General Vinoy, and the 14th, then in process of reconstruction under General Ducrot, the two aggregating an effective strength of eighty thousand men; to which were to be added fourteen thousand sailors, fifteen thousand of the francs corps, and a hundred and fifteen thousand mobiles, not to mention the three hundred thousand National Guards distributed among the sectional divisions of the ramparts. If this seems like a large force it must be remembered that there were few seasoned and trained soldiers among its numbers. Men were constantly being drilled and equipped; Paris was a great intrenched camp. The preparations for the defense went on from hour to hour with feverish haste; roads were built, houses demolished within the military zone; the two hundred siege guns and the twenty-five hundred pieces of lesser caliber were mounted in position, other guns were cast; an arsenal, complete in every detail, seemed to spring from the earth under the tireless efforts of Dorian, the patriotic war minister. When, after the rupture of the negotiations at Ferrieres, Jules Favre acquainted the country with M. von Bismarck's demands—the cession of Alsace, the garrison of Strasbourg to be surrendered, three milliards of indemnity—a cry of rage went up and the continuation of the war was demanded by acclaim as a condition indispensable to the country's existence. Even with no hope of victory Paris must defend herself in order that France might live."

"Mais la tactique de Bouroche était de ne jamais demander directement à un blessé l’autorisation d’usage, quand la nécessité d’une amputation s’imposait. Il préférait que le blessé s’y résignât de lui-même.","But Bouroche's tactic was never to ask a wounded person directly for permission to use, when the need for an amputation was necessary. He preferred that the wounded man resign himself to it.",Bouroche’s tactics were never to ask a wounded man directly for the usual permission when an amputation was clearly necessary. He preferred the patient to come round to it himself.,"Bouroche's tactics, whenever an amputation became necessary, were never to appeal directly to the patient for the customary authorization. He preferred to have the patient accede to it voluntarily."

"Et il emmena son compagnon, qui s’abandonnait. La petite ferme du père Fouchard se trouvait au sortir du défilé d’Haraucourt, près du plateau où l’artillerie de réserve avait pris position. C’était une maison basse, avec d’assez grandes dépendances, une grange, une étable, une écurie ; et, de l’autre côté de la route, dans une sorte de remise, le paysan avait installé son commerce de boucher ambulant, son abattoir où il tuait lui-même les bêtes, qu’il promenait ensuite au travers des villages, dans sa carriole.","And he took away his companion, who was abandoning himself. Father Fouchard's little farm was at the end of the defile of Haraucourt, near the plateau where the reserve artillery had taken up position. It was a low house, with fairly large outbuildings, a barn, a cowshed, a stable; and, on the other side of the road, in a kind of shed, the peasant had set up his business as an itinerant butcher, his slaughterhouse where he killed the animals himself, which he then drove through the villages, in his cart.","He took his friend away, and Jean let himself be led. Old Fouchard’s little farmhouse was at the end of the Haraucourt defile, near the plateau on which the reserve artillery had taken up its position. It was a low house with a fair number of outbuildings, a barn, cowshed and stable, and on the opposite side of the road, in a sort of coach-house, he had set up his business as a travelling butcher, his own abattoir where he slaughtered the animals himself, which he then hawked round the villages in his cart.","His comrade made no objection and they went off together. Father Fouchard's little farm was situated just at the mouth of Harancourt pass, near the plateau where the artillery was posted. The house was a low structure, surrounded by quite an imposing cluster of dependencies; a barn, a stable, and cow-sheds, while across the road was a disused carriage-house which the old peasant had converted into an abattoir, where he slaughtered with his own hands the cattle which he afterward carried about the country in his wagon to his customers."
"On était au 25 août, et Maurice, plus tard, en se rappelant la disparition de Goliath, demeura convaincu que cet homme était un de ceux qui renseignèrent le grand état-major allemand sur la marche exacte de l’armée de Châlons, et qui décidèrent le changement de front de la troisième armée. Dès le lendemain, le prince royal de Prusse quittait Revigny, l’évolution commençait, cette attaque de flanc, cet enveloppement gigantesque à marches forcées et dans un ordre admirable, au travers de la Champagne et des Ardennes. Pendant que les Français allaient hésiter et osciller sur place, comme frappés de paralysie brusque, les Prussiens faisaient jusqu’à quarante kilomètres par jour, dans leur cercle immense de rabatteurs, poussant le troupeau d’hommes qu’ils traquaient, vers les forêts de la frontière.","It was August 25, and Maurice, later on, remembering the disappearance of Goliath, remained convinced that this man was one of those who informed the German general staff of the exact march of the army of Châlons, and who decided the change of front of the Third Army. The next day, the Prince Royal of Prussia left Revigny, the evolution began, this flank attack, this gigantic envelopment with forced marches and in admirable order, across Champagne and the Ardennes. While the French were hesitating and swaying in place, as if stricken with sudden paralysis, the Prussians were making up to forty kilometers a day, in their immense circle of touts, pushing the herd of men they were tracking towards the forests of the border.","It was the 25th of August, and later, remembering Goliath’s disappearance, Maurice was convinced that he was one of those who gave information to the German High Command on the exact route of the march of the army of Châlons and who influenced the change of tactics of the third army. The very next day the Crown Prince of Prussia left Ruvigny and the manoeuvre was under way, the flanking attack, the gigantic encircling movement carried out by forced marches and with admirable efficiency across Champagne and the Ardennes. Whereas the French would hesitate and wander round and round in the same place as though they were suddenly struck with paralysis, the Prussians covered as much as forty kilometres a day like a huge circle of beaters herding the human game they were pursuing towards the forest on the frontier.","It was the 25th of August, and Maurice, when he subsequently recalled to mind Goliah's disappearance, was certain that the man had been instrumental in affording the German staff exact information as to the movements of the army of Chalons, and thus producing the change of front of their third army. The succeeding morning the Crown Prince of Prussia left Revigny and the great maneuver was initiated, that gigantic movement by the flank, surrounding and enmeshing us by a series of forced marches conducted in the most admirable order through Champagne and the Ardennes. While the French were stumbling aimlessly about the country, oscillating uncertainly between one place and another, the Prussians were making their twenty miles a day and more, gradually contracting their immense circle of beaters upon the band of men whom they held within their toils, and driving their prey onward toward the forests of the frontier."
"Si Maurice, une heure auparavant, n’avait pas mangé son croûton de pain sous les obus, jamais il n’aurait trouvé la force de faire ce qu’il fit alors. D’ailleurs, il lui fut impossible plus tard de se souvenir. Il devait avoir chargé Jean sur ses épaules, puis s’être traîné, en s’y reprenant à vingt fois, au milieu des chaumes et des broussailles, buttant à chaque pierre, se remettant quand même debout. Une volonté invincible le soutenait, une résistance qui lui aurait fait porter une montagne. Derrière le petit mur, il retrouva Rochas et les quelques hommes de l’escouade, tirant toujours, défendant le drapeau, que le sous-lieutenant tenait sous son bras.","If Maurice, an hour before, had not eaten his crust of bread under the shells, he would never have found the strength to do what he did then. Besides, it was impossible for him later to remember. He must have loaded Jean on his shoulders, then dragged himself, trying to do it twenty times, in the middle of the stubble and the brushwood, stumbling over every stone, getting back on his feet all the same. An invincible will supported him, a resistance that would have made him carry a mountain. Behind the short wall he found Rochas and the few men of the squad, still firing, defending the flag, which the second lieutenant held under his arm.","If Maurice had not eaten that crust of bread under fire an hour before he would never have found the strength to do what he now did. Not that he could remember anything about it later. He must have got Jean up on to his shoulders and then dragged himself along, with a score of failures and fresh starts, through stubble and briars, tripping over every boulder but somehow getting up again. Only invincible will-power kept him going and gave him strength that would have carried a mountain. Behind the low wall he found Rochas and the few men of the squad, still firing, defending the flag which the subaltern was holding under his arm.","Had it not been for the crust of bread he ate an hour before under the Prussian shells Maurice could never have done what he did; how he did it he could never in subsequent days remember. He must have hoisted Jean upon his shoulders and crawled through the brush and brambles, falling a dozen times only to pick himself up and go on again, stumbling at every rut, at every pebble. His indomitable will sustained him, his dogged resolution would have enabled him to bear a mountain on his back. Behind the low wall he found Rochas and the few men that were left of the squad, firing away as stoutly as ever and defending the flag, which the subaltern held beneath his arm."
"– Mais, tonnerre de Dieu ! lâchez donc ça ! cria Jean. Répondez à l’appel !","“But, thunder of God! let go of that! shouted John.

My captain told me to go to Vaugirard, with my men, and I'm going there. When the thunder of God was there, I would go all the same. It's natural, you have to feel it.","‘Oh no, my dear friend, I’m not staying with you if it’s for that kind of job! My captain has told me to go to Vaugirard with my men and I’m going. If the wrath of God were there I should go all the same. It’s natural, surely you realize that.’","“Ah, no! ah, no! my boy. I can't join you if it's for that fine work you want me. My captain told me to go with my men to Vaugirard, and there I'm going. In spite of the devil and his angels I will go there. That's natural enough; you ought to know how it is yourself.”"
"Mais, frémissante, elle s’était soulevée, avait détourné le chassepot, dont le coup alla se perdre au ciel.","But, quivering, she had risen, had diverted the Chassepot, the blow of which was lost in the sky.","But she leaped up in terror and pushed the rifle to one side, and the shot spent itself in the sky.","But, quivering with excitement, she jumped to her feet and knocked up the weapon, whose charge was wasted on the air. “Stop, stop!"

Il avait simplement ouvert les bras très grands, pareils aux branches d’un étau ; et, tourné vers le nord, il rejoignait les mains, comme si les mâchoires de l’étau se fussent tout d’un coup resserrées.","And he was silent. He had simply opened his arms very wide, like the branches of a vise; and, facing north, he joined his hands, as if the jaws of the vise had suddenly tightened.","He fell silent.

"Maurice, d’une main tâtonnante, avait pris la main de Jean. Alors, seulement, rassuré, il s’endormit. Il n’y eut, au loin, plus qu’un clocher de Sedan, dont les heures tombèrent une à une.","Maurice, with a groping hand, had taken Jean's hand. Only then, reassured, did he fall asleep. In the distance, there was only a steeple of Sedan, the hours of which fell one by one.","Maurice’s groping hand had found Jean’s, and only then did he fall asleep, reassured. Nothing was left but one distant bell in Sedan, tolling the hours one by one.","Maurice put forth his hand and felt for Jean's; at last he slumbered, comforted by the sense of human companionship. From a steeple in Sedan came the deep tones of a bell, slowly, mournfully, tolling the hour; then all was blank and void."

"C’était son idée, sauver sa pièce, ainsi qu’on sauve le drapeau. Et il parlait encore, lorsqu’il fut foudroyé, le bras droit arraché, le flanc gauche ouvert. Il était tombé sur la pièce, il y resta comme étendu sur un lit d’honneur, la tête droite, la face intacte et belle de colère, tournée là-bas, vers l’ennemi. Par son uniforme déchiré, venait de glisser une lettre, que ses doigts crispés avaient prise et que le sang tachait, goutte à goutte.","It was his idea, to save his piece, as one saves the flag. And he was still talking, when he was struck down, his right arm torn off, his left flank opened. He had fallen into the room, he lay there as if lying on a bed of honour, his head erect, his face intact and beautiful with anger, turned over there, towards the enemy. Through his torn uniform, a letter had just slipped, which his clenched fingers had taken and which the blood stained, drop by drop.","That was his idea – his gun must be saved, just as you save the flag. And he was still talking when he was struck down, his right arm torn off and his left side split open.

A letter had slipped out of his torn uniform, clenched in his fingers, and his blood was staining it drop by drop.","To save the gun, even as men risk their life to save the flag; that was his idea. And he had not ceased to speak when he was stricken down as by a thunderbolt, his right arm torn from its socket, his left flank laid open. He had fallen upon his gun he loved so well, and lay there as if stretched on a bed of honor, with head erect, his unmutilated face turned toward the enemy, and bearing an expression of proud defiance that made him beautiful in death. From his torn jacket a letter had fallen to the ground and lay in the pool of blood that dribbled slowly from above."

"Il y eut un léger rire de contentement, et la voix douce répondit :","There was a slight laugh of contentment, and the soft voice answered:",There was a happy little laugh and the gentle voice answered:,"There came the sound of a low, pleased laugh, and the same soft voice replied:"
"Cependant, Lapoulle, de temps à autre, remontait son sac, d’un haussement d’épaule. Sous le prétexte qu’il était le plus fort, on le chargeait des ustensiles communs à toute l’escouade, la grande marmite et le bidon, pour la provision d’eau. Cette fois même, on lui avait confié la pelle de la compagnie, en lui persuadant que c’était un honneur. Et il ne se plaignait pas, il riait d’une chanson dont Loubet, le ténor de l’escouade, charmait la longueur de la route. Loubet, lui, avait un sac célèbre, dans lequel on trouvait de tout : du linge, des souliers de rechange, de la mercerie, des brosses, du chocolat, un couvert et une timbale, sans compter les vivres réglementaires, des biscuits, du café ; et, bien que les cartouches y fussent aussi, qu’il y eût encore, sur le sac, la couverture roulée, la tente-abri et ses piquets, tout cela paraissait léger, tellement il savait, selon son mot, bien faire sa malle.","However, Lapoulle, from time to time, raised his bag with a shrug of the shoulder. Under the pretext that he was the strongest, they loaded him with the utensils common to the whole squad, the large pot and the can, for the supply of water. Even this time, he had been entrusted with the company shovel, persuading him that it was an honor. And he was not complaining, he was laughing at a song which Loubet, the tenor of the squad, charmed the length of the road. Loubet, he had a famous bag, in which you could find everything: linen, spare shoes, haberdashery, brushes, chocolate, cutlery and a cup, not to mention the statutory food, biscuits, coffee ; and, although the cartridges were also there, that there was still, on the bag, the rolled-up blanket, the tent-shelter and its stakes, all that seemed light, so well did he know, as he put it, to pack his trunk. .","Meanwhile Lapoulle every now and then was humping up his pack with a jerk of the shoulders. On the pretext that he was the strongest he had been loaded with the implements common to the whole squad, the big stewpan and the can with the water. This time they had even entrusted him with the company shovel, making out it was an honour. Not that he minded, but laughed away at a song with which Loubet, the tenor of the squad, was enlivening the tedious march. As for Loubet, his pack was celebrated, and you could find a bit of everything in it: underclothes, spare shoes, needle and thread, brushes, chocolate, a knife, fork and spoon, a mug, to say nothing of the regulation rations of biscuits and coffee; and although the rounds of ammunition were there too, and on top of the lot the rolled blanket, tent and pegs, it all looked as though it weighed nothing, so skilled was he at packing his trunk, as he called it.","Lapoulle meantime would every now and then give a hitch of his shoulders in an attempt to shift the weight of his knapsack when it began to be too heavy. The others, alleging that he was the strongest, were accustomed to make him carry the various utensils that were common to the squad, including the big kettle and the water-pail; on this occasion they had even saddled him with the company shovel, assuring him that it was a badge of honor. So far was he from complaining that he was now laughing at a song with which Loubet, the tenor of the squad, was trying to beguile the tedium of the way. Loubet had made himself quite famous by reason of his knapsack, in which was to be found a little of everything: linen, an extra pair of shoes, haberdashery, chocolate, brushes, a plate and cup, to say nothing of his regular rations of biscuit and coffee, and although the all-devouring receptacle also contained his cartridges, and his blankets were rolled on top of it, together with the shelter-tent and stakes, the load nevertheless appeared light, such an excellent system he had of packing his trunk, as he himself expressed it."
"– Pour ce qu’on a fait, mon Dieu ! vous avez aussi bien fait de rester couchés.","“For what we did, my God! you might as well have stayed in bed.","But Weiss made a gesture of despair. ‘Good Lord, considering all they’ve done you’ve been wise to stay in bed.’","But the accountant shook his head sorrowfully and said: “You have done just as well to remain in bed, for all that has been accomplished.”"
"Puis, malgré l’émotion où elle la voyait :","Then, despite the emotion in which she saw her:","And although she could see how upset Henriette was, she went on:","And she continued, notwithstanding the agitation on the other's face: “You have selected an unfortunate moment for your visit; my son has to go to Belgium to-night."
"Alors, Bouroche eut un grand geste, comme pour dire qu’on allait loin, quand on entrait dans ces idées-là. Il fut sur le point de parler encore, finit par se taire. Et il partit, en ajoutant simplement :","Then Bouroche made a grand gesture, as if to say that one was going a long way when one entered into such ideas. He was about to speak again, ended up being silent. And he left, simply adding:","At that Bouroche made a grand gesture suggesting that when you went in for those kinds of ideas you went too far. He was on the point of saying something else, but decided not to. So he left, just adding:","Bouroche's shrug of the shoulders seemed to indicate that he thought a young man was likely to make his mark who carried such ideas about in his head. He appeared to be about to say something further, but changed his mind and bowed himself out, simply adding:"

"Mais il crut comprendre que d’autres colonnes, à demi cachées derrière la ligne du chemin de fer, filaient vers leur droite, en tâchant de gagner les arbres lointains, de façon à se rabattre ensuite sur Bazeilles par un mouvement oblique. Si elles réussissaient de la sorte à s’abriter dans le parc de Montivilliers, le village pouvait être pris. Il en eut la rapide et vague sensation. Puis, comme l’attaque de front s’aggravait, elle s’effaça.","But he thought he understood that other columns, half hidden behind the line of the railway, were rushing to their right, trying to reach the distant trees, so as to then fall back on Bazeilles by an oblique movement. If they succeeded in taking shelter in the park of Montivilliers, the village could be taken. He had the quick and vague sensation. Then, as the frontal attack grew worse, it faded away.","But he thought he could make out other columns, half hidden behind the railway line, that were making for their right, trying to reach the trees some way off so as to swing back on Bazeilles in an oblique movement. If they succeeded by this means in gaining cover in the park of Montvillers the village could be taken. That was a quick and vague impression, but as the frontal attack grew in intensity it faded from his mind.","But there were other columns, moving to the right and partially concealed by the railway embankment, whose object, it seemed to him, was to gain the cover of some trees in the distance, whence they might descend and take Bazeilles in flank and rear. Should they succeed in effecting a lodgment in the park of Montivilliers, the village might become untenable. This was no more than a vague, half-formed idea, that flitted through his mind for a moment and faded as rapidly as it had come; the attack in front was becoming more determined, and his every faculty was concentrated on the struggle that was assuming, with every moment, larger dimensions."
"– Le bougre m’a mangé la moitié d’un doigt, gronda Cabasse dont la main saignait. Faut que je lui casse quelque chose !","“The bugger ate half a finger,” growled Cabasse, whose hand was bleeding.

"– Vous savez, ce n’est pas drôle, ça… Faites attention. Un soldat qui n’a plus ses pieds, ça n’est bon qu’à être fichu au tas de cailloux. Mon capitaine, en Italie, disait toujours qu’on gagne les batailles avec ses jambes.","- You know, it's not funny, that ... Be careful. A soldier who no longer has his feet is only good for being thrown into a pile of stones. My captain in Italy always said that you win battles with your legs.","‘You know, this isn’t funny at all … Mind what you do. A soldier who’s lost his feet is no use for anything but the scrap-heap. My captain in Italy always used to say that you win battles with your legs.’","“You must be careful; it is no laughing matter, a thing like that.

"Puis, apercevant du monde à sa gauche, deux hommes et une femme, il eut l’idée de les questionner. Mais, à son approche, la femme s’enfuit, les hommes l’écartèrent du geste, menaçants ; et il en vit d’autres, et tous l’évitaient, filaient entre les broussailles, comme des bêtes rampantes et sournoises, vêtus sordidement, d’une saleté sans nom, avec des faces louches de bandits. Alors, en remarquant que les morts, derrière ce vilain monde, n’avaient plus de souliers, les pieds nus et blêmes, il finit par comprendre que c’étaient là de ces rôdeurs qui suivaient les armées allemandes, des détrousseurs de cadavres, toute une basse juiverie de proie, venue à la suite de l’invasion. Un grand maigre fila devant lui en galopant, les épaules chargées d’un sac, les poches sonnantes des montres et des pièces blanches volées dans les goussets.","Then, noticing people on his left, two men and a woman, he had the idea of questioning them. But, at his approach, the woman fled, the men waved her aside, threatening; and he saw others, and all shunned him, scurrying through the undergrowth, like crawling, sneaky beasts, sordidly clad in nameless filth, with sleazy bandit faces. So, noticing that the dead, behind this ugly world, no longer had shoes, bare and pale feet, he ended up understanding that these were the prowlers who followed the German armies, robbers of corpses, all a base Jewry of prey, which came as a result of the invasion. A tall, skinny galloped past him, his shoulders laden with a bag, his pockets ringing with watches and white coins stolen from the fob pockets.","Seeing some people to his left, two men and a woman, he thought he would ask them. But as he went up to them the woman ran off and the men brandished threatening fists. He saw yet more and they all avoided him and ran off into the bushes like cunning, prowling animals, they were dressed in rags, unspeakably dirty, with crafty, evil-looking faces. Then he realized that where these horrible people had passed, the dead, were bootless with bare, grey-looking feet, and he understood that these were the prowling thieves who followed the German armies, the plunderers of corpses, a gypsy crew of vultures who moved in the wake of the invasion. A tall thin fellow rushed away from him with a sack over his shoulder and pockets jingling with watches and silver coins stolen from pockets.","Then perceiving people to his left, two men and a woman, it occurred to him to question them, but the woman ran away at his approach and the men repulsed him with threatening gestures; and he saw others of the same stripe, clad in sordid rags, unspeakably filthy, with the ill-favored faces of thieves and murderers, and they all shunned him, slinking away among the corpses like jackals or other unclean, creeping beasts. Then he noticed that wherever these villainous gentry passed the dead behind them were shoeless, their bare, white feet exposed, devoid of covering, and he saw how it was: they were the tramps and thugs who followed the German armies for the sake of plundering the dead, the detestable crew who followed in the wake of the invasion in order that they might reap their harvest from the field of blood. A tall, lean fellow arose in front of him and scurried away on a run, a sack slung across his shoulder, the watches and small coins, proceeds of his robberies, jingling in his pockets."
"– Ah ! dites donc, Françoise, reprit-il, je veux l’embrasser, votre petit Auguste… Mais il n’est pas si mal que ça, encore une couple de jours, et il sera hors de danger… Ayez bon courage, surtout rentrez vite, ne montrez plus votre nez.","– Ah!

"Déjà, le camp s’éveillait. Jean et Maurice conduisirent les francs-tireurs au capitaine Beaudoin, qui les mena au colonel de Vineuil. Celui-ci les interrogea ; mais Sambuc, conscient de son importance, voulait absolument parler au général ; et, comme le général Bourgain-Desfeuilles, qui avait couché chez le curé d’Oches, venait de paraître sur le seuil du presbytère, maussade de ce réveil en pleine nuit, pour une journée nouvelle de famine et de fatigue, il fit à ces hommes qu’on lui amenait un accueil furieux.","Already the camp was waking up. Jean and Maurice led the francs-tireurs to Captain Beaudoin, who led them to Colonel de Vineuil. The latter questioned them; but Sambuc, conscious of his importance, absolutely wanted to speak to the general; and, as General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, who had slept with the priest of Oches, had just appeared on the threshold of the presbytery, sullen from waking up in the middle of the night, for a new day of famine and fatigue, he told these men that he was given a furious welcome.","The camp was already awake. Jean and Maurice took the men to Captain Beaudoin, who took them to Colonel de Vineuil. The latter interrogated them, but Sambuc, conscious of his own importance, was determined to see the general, and as General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, who had slept at the house of the parish priest of Oches, had just appeared at the presbytery door, very put out at being woken up in the middle of the night to face another day of famine and fatigue, he gave these men a furious reception.","The camp was already astir; Jean and Maurice took the francs-tireurs to Captain Beaudoin, who conducted them to the quarters of Colonel Vineuil. The colonel attempted to question them, but Sambuc, intrenching himself in his dignity, refused to speak to anyone except the general. Now Bourgain-Desfeuilles had taken up his quarters that night with the cure of Osches, and just then appeared, rubbing his eyes, in the doorway of the parsonage; he was in a horribly bad humor at his slumbers having been thus prematurely cut short, and the prospect that he saw before him of another day of famine and fatigue; hence his reception of the men who were brought before him was not exactly lamblike."

"Des sanglots l’étouffèrent, et lui, blême, la gorge également serrée, attendit une minute. Cette idée qu’elle ne voulait pas mentir, le calmait pourtant. Il continua à l’interroger, la tête travaillée de tout ce qu’il n’avait pu comprendre encore.","Sobs choked him, and he, pale, his throat also tight, waited a minute. This idea that she didn't want to lie calmed him down. He continued to interrogate her, his head racked with all that he had not yet been able to understand.","She could not go on for crying, and he, deathly pale and on the point of tears too, waited a minute. And yet the thought that she could not lie to him gave him some comfort. Then he went on questioning her, for his mind was tormented by all sorts of things he could not yet understand.","Sobs choked her utterance, and he, ashy pale and with a great lump rising in his throat, waited silently for a moment.

"Il le réchauffait par ces bourrades, lorsque, brusquement, à quatre cents mètres devant eux, ils aperçurent une dizaine d’hommes, vêtus d’uniformes sombres, sortant d’un petit bois. C’étaient enfin des Prussiens, dont ils reconnaissaient les casques à pointe, les premiers Prussiens qu’ils voyaient depuis le commencement de la campagne, à portée de leurs fusils. D’autres escouades suivirent la première ; et, devant elles, on distinguait les petites fumées de poussière, que les obus soulevaient du sol. Tout cela était fin et précis, les Prussiens avaient une netteté délicate, pareils à de petits soldats de plomb, rangés en bon ordre. Puis, comme les obus pleuvaient plus fort, ils reculèrent, ils disparurent de nouveau derrière les arbres.","He was warming him up with these thumps, when, suddenly, four hundred yards in front of them, they saw a dozen men, dressed in dark uniforms, coming out of a little wood. Finally, there were Prussians, whose spiked helmets they recognized, the first Prussians they had seen since the beginning of the campaign, within range of their guns. Other squads followed the first; and, in front of them, one could make out the little fumes of dust, which the shells raised from the ground. All this was fine and precise, the Prussians had a delicate neatness, like little toy soldiers, lined up in good order. Then, as the shells rained harder, they retreated, they disappeared again behind the trees.","He was putting new heart into him with these rough words when all of a sudden, four hundred metres in front of them, they saw ten or so men in dark-coloured uniforms coming out of a little wood. They could tell by their pointed helmets that they were Prussians at last, the first Prussians they had seen within range of their rifles since the beginning of the campaign. Other squads of them followed the first, and in front of them they could make out the little clouds of dust sent up from the ground by shells. It was all clearly defined, the Prussians were sharply outlined like little tin soldiers set out in perfect order. Then, as the shells rained thicker they went back and disappeared into the trees.","He was trying to put heart into his friend by gruff but friendly speeches like the above, when they suddenly beheld a dozen dark forms emerging from a little wood upon their front and about four hundred yards away. Their spiked helmets announced them to be Prussians; the first Prussians they had had within reach of their rifles since the opening of the campaign. This first squad was succeeded by others, and in front of their position the little dust clouds that rose where the French shells struck were distinctly visible. It was all very vivid and clear-cut in the transparent air of morning; the Germans, outlined against the dark forest, presented the toy-like appearance of those miniature soldiers of lead that are the delight of children; then, as the enemy's shells began to drop in their vicinity with uncomfortable frequency, they withdrew and were lost to sight within the wood whence they had come."
"– Oh ! moi, je m’en fiche, interrompit Lapoulle. Vous allez voir !","- Oh ! I don't care, interrupted Lapoulle. You'll see !",‘Oh balls!’ cut in Lapoulle. ‘You watch me!’,"“Oh! that's all one to me,” interrupted Lapoulle. “I'll show you.”"
"Dehors, Loubet venait d’apercevoir un champ de pommes de terre, et il s’y était rué avec Lapoulle, fouillant des deux mains, arrachant, s’emplissant les poches. Mais Chouteau, en train de regarder par-dessus un petit mur, eut un sifflement d’appel, qui les fit accourir et s’exclamer : c’était un troupeau d’oies, une dizaine d’oies magnifiques, se promenant majestueusement dans une étroite cour. Tout de suite, il y eut conseil, et l’on poussa Lapoulle, on le décida à enjamber la muraille. Le combat fut terrible, l’oie qu’il avait prise faillit lui couper le nez dans la dure cisaille de son bec. Alors, il lui empoigna le cou, voulut l’étrangler, tandis qu’elle lui labourait les bras et le ventre de ses fortes pattes. Il dut lui écraser la tête du poing, et elle se débattait encore, et il se hâta de filer, poursuivi par le reste du troupeau, qui lui déchirait les jambes.","Outside, Loubet had just seen a field of potatoes, and he had rushed into it with Lapoulle, rummaging with both hands, pulling out and filling his pockets. But Chouteau, in the process of looking over a low wall, hissed a call, which made them come running and exclaim: it was a flock of geese, a dozen magnificent geese, strolling majestically in a narrow courtyard. Immediately, there was a council, and they urged Lapoulle, they persuaded him to step over the wall. The fight was terrible, the goose he had taken almost cut his nose in the hard shears of his beak. Then he grabbed her neck, tried to strangle her, while she plowed his arms and belly with her strong paws. He had to crush her head with his fist, and she was still struggling, and he hurried away, pursued by the rest of the herd, which tore at her legs.","Outside, Loubet had spied a field of potatoes, and he and Lapoulle had thrown themselves upon it, digging with both hands, tearing them out and filling their pockets. But then Chouteau, looking over a low wall, gave them a whistle call and they ran over and shouted for joy: it was a flock of geese, ten magnificent geese parading majestically in a narrow yard. At once a council was held and Lapoulle was pushed forward and made to climb over the wall. The combat was fierce, the goose he seized nearly cut his nose off with the snapping scissors of its beak. Then he grasped it by the neck and tried to strangle it, but all the time it beat on his arms and stomach with its powerful legs. He had to smash its head with his fist and yet it was still struggling as he hurried away, pursued by the rest of the gaggle tearing at his legs.","While these things were going on within the house Loubet outside had discovered a field of potatoes; he and Lapoulle scaled the fence and were digging the precious tubers with their hands and stuffing their pockets with them when Chouteau, who in the pursuit of knowledge was looking over a low wall, gave a shrill whistle that called them hurriedly to his side. They uttered an exclamation of wonder and delight; there was a flock of geese, ten fat, splendid geese, pompously waddling about a small yard. A council of war was held forthwith, and it was decided that Lapoulle should storm the place and make prisoners of the garrison. The conflict was a bloody one; the venerable gander on which the soldier laid his predaceous hands had nearly deprived him of his nose with its bill, hard and sharp as a tailor's shears. Then he caught it by the neck and tried to choke it, but the bird tore his trousers with its strong claws and pummeled him about the body with its great wings. He finally ended the battle by braining it with his fist, and it had not ceased to struggle when he leaped the wall, hotly pursued by the remainder of the flock, pecking viciously at his legs."
"Il y eut un silence. Silvine avait blêmi affreusement, tandis que le père Fouchard, saisi, remettait sur la table son verre, où il avait achevé de vider la bouteille.","There was a silence. Silvine had turned horribly pale, while Father Fouchard, startled, put his glass back on the table, where he had finished emptying the bottle.","There was a silence. Silvine turned a ghastly white, and old Fouchard looked stunned, then put his glass back on the table, where he had finished off the bottle.","There was silence in the room. Silvine's pallor was frightful to behold, while Father Fouchard displayed his interest in the narrative by replacing upon the table his glass, into which he had just poured what wine remained in the bottle."

"Pour être seuls tous deux, il l’emmena vers la petite ferme, que les soldats avaient pillée la veille, et où le paysan, incorrigible, âpre au gain quand même, venait d’installer une sorte de buvette, en mettant en perce un tonneau de vin blanc.

He had extemporized a counter from a board rested on two empty barrels before the door of his house, and over it he dealt out his stock in trade at four sous a glass, assisted by the strapping young Alsatian whom he had taken into his service three days before."

"Bouroche, dont la tournée commençait, après quelques heures de repos, s’arrêta devant le tambour Bastian, puis passa, avec un imperceptible haussement d’épaules. Rien à faire.

Justement, il en trouva deux, leur donna à chacun vingt francs. D’autres sergents arrivèrent, l’or se mit à pleuvoir sur la paille.

And that's what scares me, to know that they are all lined up like this of the city, waiting for the Prussians. I would have spun, me, oh! immediately, on Mézières. I know the country, there is no other line of retreat, or else we will be overthrown in Belgium… Then, hold on! come see something...","‘Of course,’ he went on, ‘I don’t presume to understand, but I have the feeling, yes, I feel that the army is very badly placed in Sedan… The 12th corps is at Bazeilles, where there was a little fighting this morning; the 1st is strung out all along the Givonne from the village of La Moncelle to the Garenne woods; while the 7th is camping on the plateau of Floing and the 5th, already half destroyed, is huddled right under the ramparts of the castle… And that’s what frightens me, knowing that they are all standing round the town like that, just waiting for the Prussians. If it had been me, I’d have got away at once towards Mézières. I know the country, and there’s no other line of retreat, or else we shall be pitched back into Belgium… And then besides, come and see something…’","“I do not pretend to be a judge of such matters,” he continued, “but I have a feeling, so strong as to be almost a conviction, that the army is very badly situated at Sedan. The 12th corps is at Bazeilles, where there was a little fighting this morning; the 1st is strung out along the Givonne between la Moncelle and Holly, while the 7th is encamped on the plateau of Floing, and the 5th, what is left of it, is crowded together under the ramparts of the city, on the side of the Chateau. And that is what alarms me, to see them all concentrated thus about the city, waiting for the coming of the Prussians. If I were in command I would retreat on Mezieres, and lose no time about it, either. I know the country; it is the only line of retreat that is open to us, and if we take any other course we shall be driven into Belgium. Come here! let me show you something.”"
"C’était bien la 3e division qui rentrait au camp. Le soulagement fut immense. Mais on redoubla de précautions, car les renseignements rapportés confirmaient tout ce qu’on croyait savoir sur l’approche de l’ennemi. Quelques prisonniers qu’on ramenait, des uhlans sombres, drapés de leurs grands manteaux, refusèrent de parler. Et le petit jour, une aube livide de matinée pluvieuse, se leva, dans l’attente qui continuait, énervée d’impatience. Depuis quatorze heures bientôt, les hommes n’osaient dormir. Vers sept heures, le lieutenant Rochas raconta que Mac-Mahon arrivait avec toute l’armée. La vérité était que le général Douay avait reçu, en réponse à sa dépêche de la veille annonçant la lutte inévitable sous Vouziers, une lettre du maréchal qui lui disait de tenir bon, jusqu’à ce qu’il pût le faire soutenir : le mouvement en avant était arrêté, le 1er corps se portait sur Terron, le 5e sur Buzancy, tandis que le 12e resterait au Chesne, en seconde ligne. Alors, l’attente s’élargit encore, ce n’était plus un simple combat qu’on allait livrer, mais une grande bataille, où donnerait toute cette armée, détournée de la Meuse, en marche désormais vers le sud, dans la vallée de l’Aisne. Et l’on n’osa toujours pas faire la soupe, on dut se contenter encore de café et de biscuits, car le « coup de torchon » était pour midi, tous le répétaient, sans savoir pourquoi. Un aide de camp venait d’être envoyé au maréchal, afin de hâter l’arrivée des secours, l’approche des deux armées ennemies devenant de plus en plus certaine. Trois heures plus tard, un second officier partit au galop pour le Chesne, où se trouvait le grand quartier général, dont il devait rapporter les ordres immédiats, tellement l’inquiétude avait grandi, à la suite des nouvelles données par un maire de campagne, qui prétendait avoir vu cent mille hommes à Grand-Pré, tandis que cent autres mille montaient par Buzancy.","It was indeed the 3rd Division returning to camp. The relief was immense. But we redoubled our precautions, because the information reported confirmed everything we thought we knew about the approach of the enemy. A few prisoners being brought back, dark uhlans, draped in their great cloaks, refused to speak. And daybreak, a livid dawn of a rainy morning, dawned, in the waiting that continued, enervated with impatience. For nearly fourteen hours, the men had not dared to sleep. About seven o'clock Lieutenant Rochas reported that MacMahon was arriving with the whole army. The truth was that General Douay had received, in reply to his telegram of the day before announcing the inevitable struggle under Vouziers, a letter from the marshal telling him to hold out until he could get him supported: the movement in front was halted, the 1st corps advanced on Terron, the 5th on Buzancy, while the 12th would remain at Le Chesne, in the second line. So, the expectation widened even more, it was no longer a simple fight that we were going to fight, but a great battle, where all this army would fight, diverted from the Meuse, marching now towards the south, in the valley of the Aisne. And we still didn't dare to make the soup, we had to settle for more coffee and biscuits, because the ""clothing"" was for noon, everyone repeated it, without knowing why. An aide-de-camp had just been sent to the marshal, in order to hasten the arrival of help, the approach of the two enemy armies becoming more and more certain. Three hours later, a second officer set off at a gallop for Le Chesne, where the general headquarters was, from which he was to report immediate orders, so much had the anxiety grown, following the news given by a country mayor, who claimed to have seen a hundred thousand men at Grand-Pré, while another hundred thousand went up by Buzancy.","It was indeed the third division returning to camp, and that was an immense relief. But precautions were redoubled because information received confirmed everything they thought they knew about the enemy’s approach. The few prisoners they brought back, sombre Uhlans in their long cloaks, refused to talk. Daybreak, the grey dawn of a rainy day, came up in the continuing expectancy which frayed everybody’s nerves. The men had not dared to sleep for fourteen hours. At about seven Lieutenant Rochas said that MacMahon was on the way with a whole army. The truth was that General Douay had had, by way of a reply to his dispatch sent the day before predicting the inevitable fight before Vouziers, a letter from the marshal telling him to hold on until he could send him some support: the advance had been stopped, the 1st corps was making for Terron, the 5th for Buzancy, while the 12th would stay at Le Chêne in reserve. So the wait took on an even greater significance, it was no longer a simple fight to come, but a great battle involving the whole of the army that had been headed away from the Meuse and was now on the march further south in the Aisne valley. So once again they dared not cook their hot stew but had to make do with coffee and biscuit, for the final reckoning was fixed for noon, everybody said without knowing why. An aide-de-camp had been sent off to the marshal to hasten the arrival of reinforcements, the approach of the two enemy armies being more and more certain. Three hours later a second officer galloped off for Le Chêne, where General Headquarters was, from which he was to bring back immediate orders, so much had anxiety increased following news from the mayor of some little country place who claimed to have seen a hundred thousand men at Grand-Pré while a hundred thousand more were coming up via Buzancy.","He had been right; it was the 3d division returning to camp. Everyone felt a sensation of deep relief. Increased precautions were taken, nevertheless, for what fresh intelligence they received tended to confirm what they supposed they already knew of the enemy's approach. A few uhlans, forbidding looking fellows in their long black cloaks, were brought in as prisoners, but they were uncommunicative, and so daylight came at last, the pale, ghastly light of a rainy morning, bringing with it no alleviation of their terrible suspense. No one had dared to close an eye during that long night. About seven o'clock Lieutenant Rochas affirmed that MacMahon was coming up with the whole army. The truth of the matter was that General Douay, in reply to his dispatch of the preceding day announcing that a battle at Vouziers was inevitable, had received a letter from the marshal enjoining him to hold the position until re-enforcements could reach him; the forward movement had been arrested; the 1st corps was being directed on Terron, the 5th on Buzancy, while the 12th was to remain at Chene and constitute our second line. Then the suspense became more breathless still; it was to be no mere skirmish that the peaceful valley of the Aisne was to witness that day, but a great battle, in which would participate the entire army, that was even now turning its back upon the Meuse and marching southward; and there was no making of soup, the men had to content themselves with coffee and hard-tack, for everyone was saying, without troubling himself to ask why, that the “wipe of the dish-clout” was set down for midday. An aide-de-camp had been dispatched to the marshal to urge him to hurry forward their supports, as intelligence received from every quarter made it more and more certain that the two Prussian armies were close at hand, and three hours later still another officer galloped off like mad toward Chene, where general headquarters were located, with a request for instructions, for consternation had risen to a higher pitch then ever with the receipt of fresh tidings from the maire of a country commune, who told of having seen a hundred thousand men at Grand-Pre, while another hundred thousand were advancing by way of Buzancy."
"On avait, en effet, posté là quarante et quelques soldats de l’infanterie de marine, à la tête desquels était un lieutenant, un grand garçon blond, fort jeune, l’air énergique et têtu. Déjà, ses hommes avaient pris possession du bâtiment, les uns pratiquant des meurtrières dans les volets du premier étage, sur la rue, les autres crénelant le mur bas de la cour, qui dominait les prairies, par derrière.","They had, in fact, posted there forty-some soldiers of the marine infantry, at the head of whom was a lieutenant, a tall blond boy, very young, with an energetic and stubborn air. Already, his men had taken possession of the building, some practicing loopholes in the shutters of the first floor, on the street, the others crenellating the low wall of the court, which dominated the meadows, behind.","And indeed forty or more marines had been posted there, under the command of a lieutenant, a tall, fair man, very young, who looked energetic and determined. His men had already taken over the building, some were making loopholes through the first-floor shutters facing the road, and others constructing battlements in the low wall of the yard overlooking the fields at the back.","It was true; forty and odd men of the infanterie de marine had been posted there under the command of a lieutenant, a tall, light-haired young fellow, scarcely more than a boy, but with an expression of energy and determination on his face. His men had already taken full possession of the building, some of them being engaged in loopholing the shutters of the ground-floor windows that commanded the street, while others, in the courtyard that overlooked the meadows in the rear, were breaching the wall for musketry."
"Et, comme celui-ci, après une hésitation, l’air inquiet, disait oui, le jeune homme eut un léger mouvement de recul, car ce Sambuc passait pour être un terrible chenapan, digne fils d’une famille de bûcherons qui avait mal tourné, le père ivrogne, trouvé un soir la gorge coupée, au coin d’un bois, la mère et la fille mendiantes et voleuses, disparues, tombées à quelque maison de tolérance. Lui, Guillaume, braconnait, faisait la contrebande ; et un seul petit de cette portée de loups avait grandi honnête, Prosper, le chasseur d’Afrique, qui, avant d’avoir la chance d’être soldat, s’était fait garçon de ferme, en haine de la forêt.","And, like this one, after some hesitation, with a worried air, said yes, the young man gave a slight step back, because this Sambuc passed for being a terrible scoundrel, worthy son of a family of lumberjacks who were in pain. turned, the drunken father, found one evening with their throats cut, in the corner of a wood, the mother and daughter beggars and thieves, disappeared, fallen into some brothel. He, Guillaume, poached and smuggled; and only one cub of this litter of wolves had grown up honest, Prosper, the hunter from Africa, who, before having the chance to be a soldier, had become a farm boy, hating the forest.","When after some hesitation the man nervously admitted that he was, Maurice recoiled slightly, because this Sambuc was said to be a terrible scoundrel, a worthy son of a family of woodcutters who had gone to the bad – the father, a drunkard, had been found one night in a wood with his throat cut, the mother and daughter had taken to begging and thieving and ended up in some brothel. This one, Guillaume, was a poacher and did a bit of smuggling. Only one whelp out of this litter of wolves had grown up to be respectable, Prosper, of the African Cavalry, who before he was lucky enough to get into the army had become a farm-hand because he hated the forest.","And when the man hesitatingly answered in the affirmative Maurice recoiled a step or two, for this Sambuc had the reputation of being a particularly hard case, the worthy son of a family of woodcutters who had all gone to the bad, the drunken father being found one night lying by the roadside with his throat cut, the mother and daughter, who lived by begging and stealing, having disappeared, most likely, in the seclusion of some penitentiary. He, Guillaume, did a little in the poaching and smuggling lines, and only one of that litter of wolves' whelps had grown up to be an honest man, and that was Prosper, the hussar, who had gone to work on a farm before he was conscripted, because he hated the life of the forest."
"Et, comme, de l’autre côté du canal, par la vaste plaine fertile, par les chemins plats, entre les houblonnières et les blés mûrs, on se rendait bien compte maintenant du mouvement de retraite des troupes, qui refaisaient en sens inverse le chemin déjà fait la veille, des ricanements circulèrent, toute une moquerie furieuse.","And, as, on the other side of the canal, by the vast fertile plain, by the flat roads, between the hop fields and the ripe wheat, we were now aware of the retreating movement of the troops, who were retracing the the road already made the day before, sneers circulated, a whole furious mockery.","On the other side of the canal, over the great fertile plain with its flat roads between hopfields and ripe corn, they could now see the movement of the retreating troops carrying out yesterday’s march in the opposite direction, and scornful laughs ran along, a universal burst of furious sneering:","And as they began to discern more clearly beyond the canal, across the wide fertile plain, along the level roads lined with hop-poles and fields of ripening grain, the movement of the troops retiring along the same way by which they had advanced"
"Puis, reprenant le journal, lisant :","Then, picking up the newspaper, reading:",He picked up the paper and read:,"Then taking up the paper and reading from it: “One hundred and fifty thousand prisoners, one hundred and fifty-three eagles and standards, one hundred and forty-one field guns, seventy-six machine guns, eight hundred casemate and barbette guns, three hundred thousand muskets, two thousand military train wagons, material for eighty-five batteries—”"
"– Non, j’en avais assez ! répéta Prosper, après un silence. Encore si l’on avait tiré de nous quelque chose de bon, comme là-bas, en Afrique ! Mais aller à gauche pour revenir à droite, sentir qu’on ne sert absolument à rien, ça finit par ne pas être une existence… Et puis, maintenant, mon pauvre Zéphir est mort, je serais tout seul, je n’ai plus qu’à me remettre à la terre. N’est-ce pas ? ça vaudra mieux que d’être prisonnier chez les Prussiens… Vous avez des chevaux, père Fouchard, vous verrez si je les aime et si je les soigne !","- No, I've had enough! repeated Prosper, after a silence. If only something good had been taken from us, like over there, in Africa! But going left to come back to the right, feeling that you're absolutely useless, it ends up not being an existence... And then, now, my poor Zéphir is dead, I'll be all alone, I only have 'to get me back to the ground. Is not it ? that will be better than being a prisoner with the Prussians. You have horses, Father Fouchard, you will see if I love them and if I look after them!","‘No, really, I’d had enough,’ Prosper went on after a pause. ‘I wouldn’t have minded so much if they’d put us to some good use as they did in Africa. But to move left just so as to move back right, to feel you’re absolutely no use, it isn’t any sort of existence at all… And now my poor Zephir is dead and I’d be quite alone, so the only thing I can do is go back to the land. Better than being a prisoner with the Prussians, isn’t it?… You’ve got some horses, Monsieur Fouchard, and you’ll see whether I can love them and look after them!’","They were all silent for a while, then: “No, I had enough of it!” said Prosper. “If they had but set us at work that amounted to something, as out there in Africa! but this going up the hill only to come down again, the feeling that one is of no earthly use to anyone , that is no kind of a life at all. And then I should be lonely, now that poor Zephyr is dead; all that is left me to do is to go to work on a farm. That will be better than living among the Prussians as a prisoner, don't you think so? You have horses, Father Fouchard; try me, and see whether or not I will love them and take good care of them.”"
"– Si, si.",- Yes Yes.,"‘Oh yes, oh yes.’","“Yes, yes.”"
"– Ah ! s’écria Maurice, c’est bien fichu, va ! Nous pouvons nous apprêter à être Prussiens.","– Ah! exclaimed Maurice, ""it's well done, go!"" We can prepare to be Prussians.","‘Oh,’ exclaimed Maurice, ‘it’s all up – we might as well get ready to be Prussians.’","“Ah!” exclaimed Maurice, “it is all up with us, va! we are Prussians now, and we may as well make up our mind to it.”"
"Rien ne répondait, pas un souffle. Et il enjamba l’appui, il entra, avec l’idée de se fourrer dans le lit, de l’attendre sous les couvertures, tant il faisait froid.","Nothing answered, not a breath. And he stepped over the sill, he went in, with the idea of crawling into bed, waiting for her under the covers, it was so cold.","No answer, not a breath. He stepped over the sill and went in, meaning to slip into the bed and wait for her under the sheets, for it was so cold.","No answer, not a sound. And he threw his leg over the window-sill and entered the room, intending to get into bed and snuggle away among the blankets while waiting, it was so bitter cold."
"– Mais enfin, monsieur, pourquoi tire-t-on toujours, puisque j’ai fait hisser le drapeau blanc ?","""But, sir, why are they still shooting, since I had the white flag hoisted?""","‘But why, sir, are they still firing, since I had the white flag run up?’","“What is the reason of this continued firing, sir, after I gave orders to hoist the white flag?”"
"D’une blancheur de cire, la voix mourante, le lieutenant eut encore la force de murmurer :","White as wax, his voice dying, the lieutenant still had the strength to whisper:","White as wax, and in an expiring voice the lieutenant still found the strength to murmur:",The waxen pallor of death was on the poor boy-officer's face; yet he had strength to murmur in feeble accents:
"– Alors, vous comprenez, j’ai voulu savoir, je suis remontée quatre ou cinq fois cette nuit, j’ai collé mon oreille à la cloison… Il se plaignait toujours, il n’a pas cessé de se plaindre, sans pouvoir fermer l’œil un instant, j’en suis bien sûre… Hein ? c’est terrible, de souffrir de la sorte, avec les tracas qu’il doit avoir dans la tête ! car il y a un gâchis, une bousculade ! Ma parole, ils ont tous l’air d’être fous ! Et toujours du monde nouveau qui arrive, et les portes qui battent, et des gens qui se fâchent, et d’autres qui pleurent, et un vrai pillage dans la maison en l’air, des officiers buvant aux bouteilles, couchant dans les lits avec leurs bottes !… Tenez ! c’est encore l’empereur qui est le plus gentil et qui tient le moins de place, dans le coin où il se cache pour crier.","– So, you understand, I wanted to know, I went upstairs four or five times last night, I put my ear to the partition… He was always complaining, he didn't stop complaining, unable to close the eye for a moment, I'm sure ... Huh? It's terrible, to suffer like this, with the worries he must have in his head! because there is a mess, a scramble! My word, they all look crazy! And always new people arriving, and doors banging, and people getting angry, and others crying, and real looting in the house in the air, officers drinking from bottles, sleeping in beds with their boots!... Hold on! it is still the emperor who is the nicest and who takes up the least space, in the corner where he hides to shout.","‘So you see, I wanted to find out, so I went up again four or five times during the night and glued my ear to the wall… He was still moaning and hasn’t ever stopped, and hasn’t slept a minute , I’m quite sure… Isn’t it awful to be in such pain, with all the worries he must have on his mind, for it’s a real mess, a madhouse. Upon my word, they all look mad! And always somebody else arriving, and doors banging, and people in a temper and others crying, and the whole building is being pillaged, everything upside down, what with the officers drinking out of bottles and lying in beds with their boots on! When you come to think of it, it is really the Emperor who is the nicest and takes up least room in the corner where he goes off and hides so as he can moan!’","“That made me curious to know more, you see, and I went upstairs four or five times during the night and listened, and every time it was just the same; I don't believe he was quiet an instant all night long, or got a minute's sleep. Oh! what a terrible thing it is to suffer like that with all he has to worry him! for everything is upside down; it is all a most dreadful mess. Upon my word, I believe those generals are out of their senses; such ghostly faces and frightened eyes! And people coming all the time, and doors banging and some men scolding and others crying, and the whole place like a sailor's boarding-house; officers drinking from bottles and going to bed in their boots! The Emperor is the best of the whole lot, and the one who gives least trouble, in the corner where he conceals himself and his suffering!”"
"Puis, Goliath, complaisamment, s’oublia. Il regardait autour de lui, en homme qui a du plaisir à se rappeler les choses anciennes. Il ne parla pourtant point du passé, pas plus que du présent, d’ailleurs. La conversation roula sur le grand froid qui allait gêner les travaux de la campagne ; heureusement que la neige avait du bon, ça tuait les insectes. À peine eut-il une expression de vague chagrin, en faisant allusion à la haine sourde, au mépris épouvanté qu’on lui avait témoignés dans les autres maisons de Remilly. N’est-ce pas ? chacun est de son pays, c’est tout simple qu’on serve son pays comme on l’entend. Mais, en France, il y avait des choses sur lesquelles on avait de drôles d’idées. Et le vieux le regardait, l’écoutait, si raisonnable, si conciliant, avec sa large figure gaie, en se disant que ce brave homme-là n’était sûrement pas venu dans de mauvaises intentions.","Then Goliath obligingly forgot himself. He looked around him, like a man who takes pleasure in remembering old things. He did not, however, speak of the past, any more than of the present, for that matter. The conversation revolved around the great cold which was going to hamper the work of the campaign; fortunately the snow was good, it killed the insects. Scarcely did he express an expression of vague grief when he alluded to the secret hatred, to the horrified contempt shown to him in the other houses of Remilly. Is not it ? everyone is from their country, it's quite simple that we serve our country as we see fit. But, in France, there were things about which we had funny ideas. And the old man looked at him, listened to him, so reasonable, so conciliatory, with his broad, cheerful face, telling himself that this brave man had surely not come with bad intentions.","Then Goliath calmly made himself at home. He looked about him like a man enjoying seeing old scenes again, but made no reference to the past, nor, for that matter, to the present. The conversation turned to the severe cold which was going to make work hard on the land; fortunately there was a good side to snow, it killed the pests. He did show just the slightest unhappiness when he spoke of the sullen hatred or mingled contempt and fear that had been shown him in other homes in Remilly. After all, We all have our own country, don’t we, and it’s only natural that you should serve your country according to your lights. But in France there were some things they had funny ideas about. The old man watched him talking so glibly and being so conciliatory and told himself that this good fellow, with his big jolly face, had certainly not come with evil intentions.","Then Goliah unbent and his face assumed an expression of satisfaction; he looked about him like a man pleased with the sight of objects that recalled bygone times. He did not speak of the past, however, nor, for the matter of that, did he speak of the present. The conversation ran on the extremely cold weather, which would interfere with farming operations; there was one good thing to be said for the snow, however: it would kill off the insects. He barely alluded, with a slightly pained expression, to the partially concealed hatred, the affright and scorn, with which he had been received in the other houses of Remilly. Every man owes allegiance to his country, doesn't he? It is quite clear he should serve his country as well as he knows how. In France, however, no one looked at the matter in that light; there were things about which people had very queer notions. And as the old man listened and looked at that broad, innocent, good-natured face, beaming with frankness and good-will, he said to himself that surely that excellent fellow had had no evil designs in coming there."
"Et ce fut ainsi que le sergent Sapin reçut la mort, qu’il attendait. Il s’était tourné, il vit venir l’obus, lorsqu’il ne pouvait plus l’éviter.","And so it was that Sergeant Sapin received the death he was waiting for. He had turned, he saw the shell coming, when he could no longer avoid it.",So it was that Sergeant Sapin met the death he was expecting. He had turned round and he saw the shell coming when it could no longer be avoided.,"It was then that Sergeant Sapin met the death that he had predicted for himself. He had turned his head, and caught sight of the approaching missile when it was too late for him to avoid it."
"– Mon Dieu ! puisque ça te rend service, je veux bien tout de même, je te prends… Mais, quant aux gages, faudra n’en parler que lorsque la guerre sera finie, car je n’ai vraiment besoin de personne, et les temps sont trop durs.","- My God ! since it's doing you a favor, I don't mind all the same, I'll take you… But, as for the wages, we'll have to talk about them only when the war is over, because I really don't need anyone, and the times are too long. hard.","He held up his glass once again and concluded the business without undue haste: ‘Oh well, as it will help you I don’t mind if I do… I’ll take you on… But as to any wages, can’t discuss that until the war is over, because I don’t really need anybody and times are too hard!’","“Very well; I wish to be of service to you as far as lies in my power; I will take you. As regards the question of wages, though, you must not speak of it until the war is over, for really I am not in need of anyone and the times are too hard.”"
"– Vous êtes ensemble, sains et saufs tous les deux, et vous avez vos fillettes : de quoi vous plaignez-vous ?","“You are together, both safe and sound, and you have your little girls: what are you complaining about?","‘You are together, both safe and sound, you have your little girls, what are you complaining about?’","“You have been preserved to each other, you are safe and unharmed; your three little girls are left you.

"– Sans doute, sans doute…","- No doubt, no doubt...","‘Of course, of course…’","“To be sure, to be sure—”"
"Dans la remise, en bas, Jean et Maurice venaient en effet de trouver, assis sur une chaise de la cuisine, protégé par une seule petite table de bois blanc, un officier payeur qui, sans plume, sans reçu, sans paperasse d’aucune sorte, distribuait des fortunes. Il puisait simplement au fond des sacoches débordantes de pièces d’or ; et, ne prenant pas même la peine de compter, à poignées rapides, il emplissait les képis de tous les sergents du 7e corps, qui défilaient devant lui. Ensuite, il était convenu que les sergents partageraient les sommes entre les soldats de leur demi-section. Chacun d’eux recevait ça d’un air gauche, ainsi qu’une ration de café ou de viande, puis s’en allait, embarrassé, vidant le képi dans leurs poches, pour ne pas se retrouver par les rues, avec tout cet or au grand jour. Et pas une parole n’était dite, on n’entendait que le ruissellement cristallin des pièces, au milieu de la stupeur de ces pauvres diables, à se voir accabler de cette richesse, quand il n’y avait plus, dans la ville, un pain ni un litre de vin à acheter.","In the shed downstairs, Jean and Maurice had just found, seated on a kitchen chair, protected by a single small white wooden table, a paying officer who, without a pen, without a receipt, without any paperwork kind, distributed fortunes. He simply dipped from the bottom of satchels overflowing with gold coins; and, not even taking the trouble to count, with quick handfuls he filled the caps of all the sergeants of the 7th corps, who filed past him. Then, it was agreed that the sergeants would share the sums between the soldiers of their half-section. Each of them received it clumsily, like a ration of coffee or meat, then went off, embarrassed, emptying the kepi into their pockets, so as not to end up in the streets, with all this gold in broad daylight. And not a word was said, one heard only the crystalline streaming of coins, in the midst of the amazement of these poor devils, to see themselves overwhelmed with this wealth, when there was no longer, in the city, a loaf or a liter of wine to buy.","Down in the coach-house Jean and Maurice did find a paymaster, sitting on a kitchen chair with only a little whitewood table in front of him, and no pen, no receipts, no papers of any kind, doling out fortunes. All he did was thrust his hands into money-bags bursting with gold coins, and without even bothering to count he quickly put handfuls into the képis of all the sergeants of the 7th corps who were passing him in line. It was understood that the sergeants would share out the sums among the soldiers in their half-sections. Each one received it awkwardly, like a ration of coffee or meat, and went off in embarrassment, emptying the képi into his pockets so as not to be out in the street in broad daylight with all that gold. Not a word was being said, and there was no sound except the clear tinkle of the coins, to the amazement of these poor devils seeing themselves loaded with riches when there wasn’t a loaf of bread or litre of wine left to be bought.","Jean and Maurice, on descending to the shed in the courtyard, had found there an officer of the pay department, seated on a common kitchen chair behind a little unpainted pine table, who, without pen, ink, or paper, without taking receipts or indulging in formalities of any kind, was dispensing fortunes. He simply stuck his hand into the open mouth of the bags filled with bright gold pieces, and as the sergeants of the 7th corps passed in line before him he filled their kepis, never counting what he bestowed with such rapid liberality. The understanding was that the sergeants were subsequently to divide what they received with the surviving men of their half-sections. Each of them received his portion awkwardly, as if it had been a ration of meat or coffee, then stalked off in an embarrassed, self-conscious sort of way, transferring the contents of the kepi to his trousers' pockets so as not to display his wealth to the world at large. And not a word was spoken; there was not a sound to be heard but the crystalline chink and rattle of the coin as it was received by those poor devils, dumfounded to see the responsibility of such riches thrust on them when there was not a place in the city where they could purchase a loaf of bread or a quart of wine."
"Cependant, là-bas, devant Vouziers, Jean n’avait point dormi. Depuis que Maurice lui avait expliqué comment cette retraite allait tout sauver, il veillait, empêchant ses hommes de s’écarter, attendant l’ordre de départ, que les officiers pouvaient donner d’une minute à l’autre. Vers deux heures, dans l’obscurité profonde, que les feux étoilaient de rouge, un grand bruit de chevaux traversa le camp : c’était la cavalerie qui partait en avant-garde, vers Ballay et Quatre-Champs, afin de surveiller les routes de Boult-aux-Bois et de la Croix-aux-Bois. Une heure plus tard, l’infanterie et l’artillerie se mirent à leur tour en branle, quittant enfin ces positions de Falaise et de Chestres, que depuis deux grands jours elles s’entêtaient à défendre contre un ennemi qui ne venait point. Le ciel s’était couvert, la nuit restait profonde, et chaque régiment s’éloignait dans le plus grand silence, un défilé d’ombres se dérobant au fond des ténèbres. Mais tous les cœurs battaient d’allégresse, comme si l’on eût échappé à un guet-apens. On se voyait déjà sous les murs de Paris, à la veille de la revanche.","However, over there, in front of Vouziers, Jean had not slept. Since Maurice had explained to him how this retreat was going to save everything, he had been watching, preventing his men from departing, waiting for the order to leave, which the officers could give at any minute. About two o'clock, in the deep darkness, which the fires were starring red, a great noise of horses crossed the camp: it was the cavalry which left in advance, towards Ballay and Quatre-Champs, in order to watch the roads. Boult-aux-Bois and Croix-aux-Bois. An hour later, the infantry and the artillery set off in their turn, finally leaving the positions of Falaise and Chestres, which for two long days they had been stubbornly defending against an enemy who did not come. The sky was overcast, the night remained deep, and each regiment moved away in the greatest silence, a procession of shadows hiding in the depths of the darkness. But all hearts beat with joy, as if they had escaped an ambush. We already saw each other under the walls of Paris, on the eve of revenge.","And just outside Vouziers Jean had not slept either. Since Maurice had explained how the retreat was going to save the whole situation, he had kept awake, preventing his men from straying too far away, waiting for the order to leave which the officers might give at any moment. At about two, in the pitch darkness starred with red fires, a great noise of horses went through the camp: it was the cavalry setting off as advance guard for Ballay and Quatre-Champs so as to keep an eye on the roads from Boult-aux-Bois and La Croix-aux-Bois. One hour later the infantry and artillery began to move in their turn, finally giving up their positions at Falaise and Chestres, which they had obstinately defended for two whole days against an enemy who never appeared. The sky was overcast and it was still dark night as each regiment went off with the utmost silence, a procession of men disappearing into the blackness. But all hearts were beating with joy, as though they had escaped from an ambush. They already saw themselves at the walls of Paris and on the eve of taking their revenge.","Jean, meantime, down there before Vouziers, had not been slumbering. Maurice had explained to him how the retreat was to be salvation to them all, and he was keeping watch, holding his men together and waiting for the order to move, which might come at any minute. About two o'clock, in the intense darkness that was dotted here and there by the red glow of the watch-fires, a great trampling of horses resounded through the camp; it was the advance-guard of cavalry moving off toward Balay and Quatre-Champs so as to observe the roads from Boult-aux-Bois and Croix-aux-Bois; then an hour later the infantry and artillery also put themselves in motion, abandoning at last the positions of Chestre and Falaise that they had defended so persistently for two long days against an enemy who never showed himself. The sky had become overcast, the darkness was profound, and one by one the regiments marched out in deepest silence, an array of phantoms stealing away into the bosom of the night. Every heart beat joyfully, however, as if they were escaping from some treacherous pitfall; already in imagination the troops beheld themselves under the walls of Paris, where their revenge was awaiting them."
"Otto Gunther, le cousin, était toujours serré correctement dans son uniforme de capitaine de la garde. Il avait son air sec de bel officier bien tenu. Et lui ne reconnaissait pas cette femme mince, l’air chétif, avec ses pâles cheveux blonds, son joli visage doux, cachés sous le crêpe de son chapeau. Ce fut seulement à la clarté brave et droite de ses yeux, qu’il finit par se souvenir. Il eut simplement un petit geste.","Otto Gunther, the cousin, was still snug properly in his Captain of the Guard uniform. He had the dry look of a handsome, well-kept officer. And he did not recognize this slender, puny-looking woman, with her pale blond hair, her pretty soft face, hidden under the crepe of her hat. It was only by the brave and upright clarity of her eyes that he finally remembered. He just made a small gesture.","Otto Gunther, Weiss’s cousin, was still smartly dressed in the tight-fitting uniform of a captain in the Prussian Guard, with the tight-lipped air of a fine, well-groomed officer. He did not recognize this thin, delicate-looking woman with her fair hair and pretty, sweet face under the widow’s veil. It was only her clear serious eyes that made him remember her. He merely made a little gesture.","It was Otto Gunther, the cousin, as stiff and ceremonious as ever, tight-buttoned in his Guard's uniform, the picture of a narrow-minded martinet. At first he failed to recognize the little, thin, insignificant-looking woman, with the handsome light hair and the pale, gentle face; it was only by the brave, honest look that filled her eyes that he finally remembered her. His only answer was a slight shrug of the shoulders."
"Dans la salle à manger, qu’ils traversèrent, il témoigna son étonnement.","In the dining room, which they crossed, he expressed his astonishment.",As they went through the dining-room he expressed his astonishment:,As they were passing through the dining room he expressed his surprise.
"Place Turenne et place du Rivage, Delaherche parvint à se frayer péniblement un passage dans la cohue. En passant devant l’hôtel de la Croix d’Or, il eut une vision morne de la salle à manger, où des généraux étaient assis, muets, devant la table vide. Il n’y avait plus rien, pas même du pain. Cependant, le général Bourgain-Desfeuilles, qui tempêtait dans la cuisine, dut trouver quelque chose, car il se tut et monta vivement l’escalier, les mains embarrassées d’un papier gras. Une telle foule était là, à regarder de la place, au travers des vitres, cette table d’hôte lugubre, balayée par la disette, que le fabricant de drap dut jouer des coudes, comme englué, reperdant parfois, sous une poussée, le chemin qu’il avait gagné déjà. Mais, dans la Grande-Rue, le mur devint infranchissable, il désespéra un instant. Toutes les pièces d’une batterie semblaient y avoir été jetées les unes par-dessus les autres. Il se décida à monter sur les affûts, il enjamba les pièces, sauta de roue en roue, au risque de se rompre les jambes. Ensuite, ce furent des chevaux qui lui barrèrent le chemin ; et il se baissa, se résigna à filer parmi les pieds, sous les ventres de ces lamentables bêtes, à demi mortes d’inanition. Puis, après un quart d’heure d’efforts, comme il arrivait à la hauteur de la rue Saint-Michel, les obstacles grandissants l’effrayèrent, il projeta de s’engager dans cette rue, pour faire le tour par la rue des Laboureurs, espérant que ces voies écartées seraient moins envahies. La malchance voulut qu’il y eût là une maison louche, dont une bande de soldats ivres faisaient le siège ; et, craignant d’attraper quelque mauvais coup, dans la bagarre, il revint sur ses pas. Dès lors, il s’entêta, il poussa jusqu’au bout de la Grande-Rue, tantôt marchant en équilibre sur des timons de voiture, tantôt escaladant des fourgons. Place du Collège, il fut porté sur des épaules pendant une trentaine de pas. Il retomba, faillit avoir les côtes défoncées, ne se sauva qu’en se hissant aux barreaux d’une grille. Et, lorsqu’il atteignit enfin la rue Maqua, en sueur, en lambeaux, il y avait plus d’une heure qu’il s’épuisait, depuis son départ de la Sous-Préfecture, pour faire un chemin qui lui demandait, d’habitude, moins de cinq minutes.","Place Turenne and Place du Rivage, Delaherche managed to force his way through the crowd. As he passed the Hôtel de la Croix d'Or, he had a bleak view of the dining room, where generals sat silently in front of the empty table. There was nothing left, not even bread. However, General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, who was storming in the kitchen, must have found something, for he fell silent and ran up the stairs, his hands clogged with greasy paper. Such a crowd was there, watching from the square, through the windows, this gloomy table d'hôte, swept away by scarcity, that the cloth-maker had to jostle, as if stuck, sometimes losing again, under a push, the way he had already won. But, in the Grande-Rue, the wall became impassable, he despaired for a moment. All the pieces of a battery seemed to have been thrown there one on top of the other. He decided to mount the carriages, he stepped over the guns, jumped from wheel to wheel, at the risk of breaking his legs. Then it was horses that blocked his way; and he bent down, resigned himself to spinning among the feet, under the bellies of these lamentable beasts, half dead from starvation. Then, after a quarter of an hour of effort, as he arrived at the height of the rue Saint-Michel, the growing obstacles frightened him, he planned to enter this street, to go around by the rue des Plowmen, hoping that these out of the way ways would be less invaded. As luck would have it, there was a shady house there, besieged by a band of drunken soldiers; and, fearing to catch some bad blow in the fight, he retraced his steps. From then on, he stubbornly pushed on to the end of the Grande-Rue, sometimes walking balanced on carriage poles, sometimes climbing over vans. Place du College, he was carried on his shoulders for about thirty paces. He fell back, nearly had his ribs smashed, only saved himself by climbing up the bars of a gate. And when he finally reached Rue Maqua, sweating and in tatters, he had been exhausting himself for more than an hour, since leaving the Sub-Prefecture, to walk a path that required him to usual, less than five minutes.","Delaherche managed with difficulty to fight his way through the pack and cross the Place Turenne and the Place du Rivage. As he passed the Hôtel de la Croix d’Or he caught a depressing glimpse of the dining-room, in which some generals were sitting in silence at an empty table. There was nothing left, not even any bread. But General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, who was storming about in the kitchen, must have found something, for he stopped talking and then ran up the stairs awkwardly holding in both hands something in greasy paper. There was such a crowd staring in from the pavement through the window at this glum board, swept clean by famine, that Delaherche had to shove with his elbows, feeling caught in a web, and sometimes being pushed back and losing what headway he had gained. But when he got to the Grande-Rue, the wall of people was impassable, and for a moment he gave up hope. Here all the guns in a battery seemed to have been piled on top of each other. So he made up his mind and climbed up on to the gun-carriages, stepped over the guns themselves, leaping from wheel to wheel at the risk of breaking his legs. Then there were horses in the way, and he stooped down and was reduced to making his way between the legs and under the bellies of these poor, half-starved creatures. After struggling for a quarter of an hour he reached the top of rue Saint-Michel, but there the growing number of obstacles frightened him, and he thought he would go along that street and get round via rue des Laboureurs, hoping that these back streets would be less crowded. But as ill-luck would have it there was a brothel down there, besieged by a lot of drunken soldiers, and fearing he might fare badly in some shindy he retraced his steps. So then he fought on and got to the end of the Grand-rue, sometimes balancing on cart-shafts, sometimes climbing over vans. In the Place du College he was actually carried along on people’s shoulders for some thirty metres. He fell off and nearly had his ribs broken, only getting away by climbing some railings. When at last he reached rue Maqua, in a sweat and torn to shreds, he had been wearing himself out for an hour since leaving the Sub-Prefecture to do a journey that usually took him under five minutes.","In the Place Turenne and Place du Rivage, Delaherche succeeded with the greatest difficulty in working his way through the press. As he passed the Hotel of the Golden Cross a sorrowful vision greeted his eyes, that of the generals seated in the dining room, gloomily silent, around the empty board; there was nothing left to eat in the house, not even bread. General Bourgain-Desfeuilles, however, who had been storming and vociferating in the kitchen, appeared to have found something, for he suddenly held his peace and ran away swiftly up the stairs, holding in his hands a large paper parcel of a greasy aspect. Such was the crowd assembled there, to stare through the lighted windows upon the guests assembled around that famine-stricken table d'hote, that the manufacturer was obliged to make vigorous play with his elbows, and was frequently driven back by some wild rush of the mob and lost all the distance, and more, that he had just gained. In the Grande Rue, however, the obstacles became actually impassable, and there was a moment when he was inclined to give up in despair; a complete battery seemed to have been driven in there and the guns and materiel piled, pell-mell, on top of one another. Deciding finally to take the bull by the horns, he leaped to the axle of a piece and so pursued his way, jumping from wheel to wheel, straddling the guns, at the imminent risk of breaking his legs, if not his neck. Afterward it was some horses that blocked his way, and he made himself lowly and stooped, creeping among the feet and underneath the bellies of the sorry jades, who were ready to die of inanition, like their masters. Then, when after a quarter of an hour's laborious effort he reached the junction of the Rue Saint-Michel, he was terrified at the prospect of the dangers and obstacles that he had still to face, and which, instead of diminishing, seemed to be increasing, and made up his mind to turn down the street above mentioned, which would take him into the Rue des Laboureurs; he hoped that by taking these usually quiet and deserted passages he should escape the crowd and reach his home in safety. As luck would have it he almost directly came upon a house of ill-fame to which a band of drunken soldiers were in process of laying siege, and considering that a stray shot, should one reach him in the fracas, would be equally as unpleasant as one intended for him, he made haste to retrace his steps. Resolving to have done with it he pushed on to the end of the Grande Rue, now gaining a few feet by balancing himself, rope-walker fashion, along the pole of some vehicle, now climbing over an army wagon that barred his way. At the Place du College he was carried along—bodily on the shoulders of the throng for a space of thirty paces; he fell to the ground, narrowly escaped a set of fractured ribs, and saved himself only by the proximity of a friendly iron railing, by the bars of which he pulled himself to his feet. And when at last he reached the Rue Maqua, inundated with perspiration , his clothing almost torn from his back, he found that he had been more than an hour in coming from the Sous-Prefecture, a distance which in ordinary times he was accustomed to accomplish in less than five minutes."
"– Weiss ? mais il est resté là-bas, Weiss !","– Weiss? but he stayed there, Weiss!","‘Weiss? Oh, he stayed there, Weiss did!’","“Weiss? why, he stayed behind there, Weiss did.”"
"Il y eut un silence. Puis, Maurice causa un instant de Remilly, de l’oncle Fouchard, et Prosper regretta de ne pouvoir aller serrer la main d’Honoré, le maréchal des logis, dont la batterie devait camper à plus d’une lieue de là, de l’autre côté du chemin de Laon. Mais un ébrouement de cheval lui fit dresser l’oreille, il se leva, disparut pour s’assurer que Zéphir ne manquait de rien. Peu à peu, des soldats de toute arme et de tous grades envahissaient la guinguette, à cette heure de la demi-tasse et du pousse-café. Pas une des tables ne restait libre, c’était une gaieté éclatante d’uniformes dans la verdure des pampres éclaboussés de soleil. Le major Bouroche venait de s’asseoir près de Rochas, lorsque Jean se présenta, porteur d’un ordre.","There was a silence. Then Maurice talked for a moment about Remilly, about Uncle Fouchard, and Prosper regretted not being able to shake hands with Honoré, the quartermaster, whose battery was to camp more than a league away, on the other side of Chemin de Laon. But a horse snort made him prick up his ears, he got up, disappeared to make sure that Zéphir lacked nothing. Gradually, soldiers of all arms and all ranks invaded the guinguette, at this hour of the half-cup and the push-coffee. Not one of the tables remained free, there was a dazzling gaiety of uniforms in the greenery of the vines splashed with sunlight. Major Bouroche had just taken his seat near Rochas when Jean presented himself bearing an order.","There was a silence. Then Maurice talked for a minute or two about Remilly and Uncle Fouchard, and Prosper was sorry he couldn’t go and have a look at Honoré, the sergeant, whose battery must be in camp more than a league away, on the further side of the Laon road. But then the snorting of a horse made him prick up his ears and he got up and went off to make sure Zephir was all right. Gradually soldiers of all arms and ranks were filling the inn, this being the time for coffee and drinks. There wasn’t a single table left free and the uniforms made gay splashes of colour against the greenery of creepers flecked with sunshine. Major Bouroche had just sat down next to Rochas when Jean appeared with an order.","There was silence for a moment, then Maurice gave some brief news of Remilly and uncle Fouchard, and Prosper expressed his regret that he could not go and shake hands with Honore, the quartermaster-sergeant, whose battery was stationed more than a league away, on the other side of the Laon road. But the chasseur pricked up his ears at hearing the whinnying of a horse and rose and went out to make sure that Poulet was not in want of anything. It was the hour sacred to coffee and pousse-cafe, and it was not long before the little hostelry was full to overflowing with officers and men of every arm of the service. There was not a vacant table, and the bright uniforms shone resplendent against the green background of leaves checkered with spots of sunshine. Major Bouroche had just come in and taken a seat beside Rochas, when Jean presented himself with an order."
"Une rafale plia les arbres, au loin, fit gémir les vieilles charpentes de la ferme. Si l’hiver devait être dur, quelles souffrances pour les pauvres soldats, sans feu, sans pain, qui se battraient dans la neige !","A gust bent the trees in the distance, made the old framework of the farm groan. If the winter were to be hard, what sufferings for the poor soldiers, without fire, without bread, who would fight in the snow!","A squall bowed the trees outside and the old timbers of the farmhouse groaned. If they were in for a hard winter what sufferings there would be for the poor soldiers with no fire, no food and fighting in the snow.","A more furious blast bent the sturdy trees out-doors and made the timbers of the old farmhouse creak and groan. Think of the sufferings the poor fellows would have to endure should the winter be severe, fighting in the snow, without bread, without fire!"
"Mais il y eut un brusque mouvement. Et Jean, qui était resté à une des portes de la tonnelle, se retourna, en disant :","But there was a sudden movement.

"Du haut d’une pente voisine, une centaine de chevaux, libres, sans cavaliers, quelques-uns encore portant tout un paquetage, dévalaient, roulaient vers eux, d’un train d’enfer. C’étaient les bêtes perdues, restées sur le champ de bataille, qui se réunissaient ainsi en troupe, par un instinct. Sans foin ni avoine, depuis l’avant-veille, elles avaient tondu l’herbe rare, entamé les haies, rongé l’écorce des arbres. Et, quand la faim les cinglait au ventre comme à coups d’éperon, elles partaient toutes ensemble d’un galop fou, elles chargeaient au travers de la campagne vide et muette, écrasant les morts, achevant les blessés.","From the top of a nearby slope, a hundred horses, free, without riders, some still carrying a whole pack, were hurtling down, rolling towards them, at a breakneck pace.

Without hay or oats, since two days before, they had mowed the scanty grass, cut into the hedges, gnawed the bark of the trees.

"Pendant l’interminable journée de la bataille, Silvine, du coteau de Remilly, où était bâtie la petite ferme du père Fouchard, n’avait cessé de regarder vers Sedan, dans le tonnerre et la fumée des canons, toute frissonnante à la pensée d’Honoré. Et, le lendemain, son inquiétude augmenta encore, accrue par l’impossibilité de se procurer des nouvelles exactes, au milieu des Prussiens qui gardaient les routes, refusant de répondre, ne sachant du reste rien eux-mêmes.

Yesterday’s bright sun had gone and rain showers cast a melancholy gloom over the valley.","All the long, long day of the battle Silvine, up on Remilly hill, where Father Fouchard's little farm was situated, but her heart and soul absent with Honore amid the dangers of the conflict, never once took her eyes from off Sedan, where the guns were roaring. The following day, moreover, her anxiety was even greater still, being increased by her inability to obtain any definite tidings, for the Prussians who were guarding the roads in the vicinity refused to answer questions, as much from reasons of policy as because they knew but very little themselves. The bright sun of the day before was no longer visible, and showers had fallen, making the valley look less cheerful than usual in the wan light."

"Delaherche eut un sursaut de joie involontaire. Enfin, on allait donc être tranquille ! Puis, cette joie lui parut antipatriotique, il la refréna. Mais son cœur soulagé battait quand même, et il regarda un colonel et un capitaine, suivis du sergent, qui sortaient à pas précipités de la Sous-Préfecture. Le colonel portait, sous le bras, la nappe roulée. Il eut l’idée de les suivre, il quitta Rose, laquelle était très fière d’avoir fourni ce linge. À ce moment, deux heures sonnaient.","Delaherche gave an involuntary burst of joy. Finally, we were going to be quiet! Then, this joy seemed unpatriotic to him, he curbed it. But his relieved heart was beating all the same, and he watched a colonel and a captain, followed by the sergeant, rushing out of the Sous-Prefecture. The colonel carried the rolled up tablecloth under his arm. He had the idea to follow them, he left Rose, who was very proud to have provided this linen. At that moment, two o'clock struck.","Delaherche almost jumped for joy in spite of himself. At last they were going to be quiet! Then, this joy seemed unpatriotic and he checked it. But all the same his heart throbbed with relief, and he saw a colonel, a captain and the sergeant run out of the Sub-Prefecture. The colonel was carrying the rolled cloth under his arm. Delaherche thought he would follow them, and left Rose, who was very proud of having supplied this piece of linen. At that moment it was striking two.","Delaherche gave a little involuntary start of delight; they were to have a respite at last, then! Then he thought it might be unpatriotic to be joyful at such a time, and put on a long face again; but none the less his heart was very glad and he contemplated with much interest a colonel and captain, followed by the sergeant, as they hurriedly left the Sous-Prefecture. The colonel had the tablecloth, rolled in a bundle, beneath his arm. He thought he should like to follow them, and took leave of Rose, who was very proud that her napery was to be put to such use. It was then just striking two o'clock."
"– Oh ! non, Silvine est là-bas qui donne à manger aux vaches… Est-ce que tu veux la voir, Silvine ?","- Oh ! no, Silvine is over there feeding the cows… Do you want to see her, Silvine?","‘Oh no, Silvine is out there feeding the cows… Do you want to see Silvine?’","“Oh, no; Silvine is out at the barn, feeding the cows. Would you like to see her?”"
"– Eh bien, ils ne savent seulement pas si les pharmaciens en ont encore !","– Well, they just don't know if the pharmacists still have any!","‘Well, they don’t even know whether the chemists have still got any!’","“Well, they can't even tell whether the apothecaries have any or not!”"
"Et cette poussée furieuse allait s’écraser plus loin, à l’extrémité méridionale du village, qu’un bouquet d’arbres sépare du fleuve, et où le génie avait, le matin, jeté un pont de bateaux. Un bac se trouvait à droite, la maison du passeur blanchissait, solitaire, dans les hautes herbes. Sur les deux rives, on avait allumé de grands feux, dont les flammes, activées par moments, incendiaient la nuit, éclairant l’eau et les berges d’une lumière de plein jour. Alors apparaissait l’énorme entassement de troupes qui attendaient, pendant que la passerelle ne permettait que le passage de deux hommes à la fois, et que, sur le pont, large au plus de trois mètres, la cavalerie, l’artillerie, les bagages, défilaient au pas, d’une lenteur mortelle. On disait qu’il y avait encore là une brigade du 1er corps, un convoi de munitions, sans compter les quatre régiments de cuirassiers de la division Bonnemain. Et, derrière, arrivait tout le 7e corps, trente et quelques mille hommes, croyant avoir l’ennemi sur les talons, ayant la hâte fébrile de se mettre à l’abri, sur l’autre rive.","And this furious thrust was about to crash further on, at the southern extremity of the village, which a clump of trees separates from the river, and where the genius had, in the morning, thrown a bridge of boats. A ferry was on the right, the ferryman's house whitened, solitary, in the tall grass. On both banks, great fires had been lit, the flames of which, kindling from time to time, set fire to the night, illuminating the water and the banks with a light of broad daylight. Then appeared the huge heap of troops waiting, while the bridge only allowed the passage of two men at a time, and on the bridge, wide at most three meters, the cavalry, the artillery, the baggage , marched past with deadly slowness. It was said that there was still a brigade of the 1st corps there, an ammunition convoy, not to mention the four regiments of cuirassiers of the Bonnemain division. And, behind, came the whole 7th corps, thirty-one thousand men, believing they had the enemy on their heels, in a feverish haste to take shelter on the other bank.","This desperate pressure came up against a stoppage further on, at the southern end of the village, separated by a clump of trees from the river, over which the engineers had thrown a pontoon bridge that morning. To the right there was a ferry, and the ferryman’s house stood white and isolated amid tall weeds. Big fires had been lit on both banks, and the flames leaped up now and again and filled the night with a glare that made the water and banks as light as day. Then it was possible to see the huge pile-up of waiting troops, for the footbridge allowed only two men to cross at once, while on the bridge proper, three metres wide at the most, the cavalry, artillery and baggage-train moved at a mortally slow walking-pace. It was said that a brigade of the 1st corps was coming up, thirty-odd thousand men who, believing the enemy was at their heels, were in feverish haste to reach safety on the opposite bank.","All this mad hurly-burly was going on at the southern end of the village, which is here separated from the Meuse by a little grove of trees, and where the engineers had that morning stretched a bridge of boats across the river. There was a ferry to the right; the ferryman's house stood by itself, white and staring, amid a rank growth of weeds. Great fires had been built on either bank, which, being replenished from time to time, glared ruddily in the darkness and made the stream and both its shores as light as day. They served to show the immense multitude of men massed there, awaiting a chance to cross, while the footway only permitted the passage of two men abreast, and over the bridge proper the cavalry and artillery were obliged to proceed at a walk, so that the crossing promised to be a protracted operation. It was said that the troops still on the left bank comprised a brigade of the 1st corps, an ammunition train, and the four regiments of cuirassiers belonging to Bonnemain's division, while coming up in hot haste behind them was the 7th corps, over thirty thousand strong, possessed with the belief that the enemy was at their heels and pushing on with feverish eagerness to gain the security of the other shore."
"– Eh ! Cabasse ! Ducat ! cria-t-il en se retournant, eh ! bougres de feignants, arrivez donc !","– Hey! Crap! Ducat! he cried, turning round, eh! lazy buggers, come on!","‘Here, Cabasse, Ducat!’ he shouted behind him. ‘ Come on, you lazy buggers!’","“Hallo there, Cabasse!

"Le silence recommença. Il était parti au septième mois de sa grossesse, il savait bien qu’il avait un enfant, mais il le voyait pour la première fois. Aussi voulut-il s’expliquer, en garçon de sens pratique qui est convaincu d’avoir de bonnes raisons.","The silence began again. He had left in the seventh month of his pregnancy, he knew he had a child, but he was seeing him for the first time. So he wanted to explain himself, like a practical boy who is convinced he has good reasons.","Silence fell again. He had left in the seventh month of her pregnancy and so knew he had a child, but he was seeing it for the first time. So he wanted to get things straight, being a practical, sensible fellow convinced he was in the right.","Silence again settled down upon the room. He had known there was a child, although he had gone away before the birth of his offspring, but this was the first time he had laid eyes on it. He therefore wished to explain matters, like a young man of sense who is confident he can give good reasons for his conduct."
"Et, comme ils s’étaient quittés, les deux hommes se retrouvèrent, en s’embrassant. Sous la pluie battante qui continuait, le simple soldat rentra dans le rang, tandis que le caporal donnait l’exemple, ruisselant, sans une plainte.","And, as they had parted, the two men met again, embracing each other. In the pouring rain that continued, the common soldier returned to the ranks, while the corporal set the example, dripping, without a complaint.","And as they had parted so the two met again, with an embrace. In the still driving rain the private soldier rejoined the ranks while the corporal set the example, streaming wet but making no complaint.","The two men met, as they had parted, with an embrace. In the drenching rain that still beat down as pitilessly as ever, the humble private resumed his place in the ranks, while the corporal, in his streaming garments, never murmured as he gave him the example of what a soldier should be."
"Sambuc jura toujours sur la tête de son père qu’il avait bien mis les deux bons cailloux aux pattes. Pourtant, le corps remonta, les Prussiens le découvrirent trois jours plus tard, à Pont-Maugis, dans de grandes herbes ; et leur fureur fut extrême, lorsqu’ils eurent tiré du sac ce mort, saigné au cou comme un pourceau. Il y eut des menaces terribles, des vexations, des perquisitions. Sans doute, quelques habitants durent trop causer, car on vint un soir arrêter le maire de Remilly et le père Fouchard, coupables d’entretenir de bons rapports avec les francs-tireurs, qu’on accusait d’avoir fait le coup. Et le père Fouchard, dans cette circonstance extrême, fut vraiment très beau, avec son impassibilité de vieux paysan qui connaissait la force invincible du calme et du silence. Il marcha, sans s’effarer, sans même demander d’explications. On allait bien voir. Dans le pays, on disait tout bas qu’il avait déjà tiré des Prussiens une grosse fortune, des sacs d’écus enfouis quelque part, un à un, à mesure qu’il les gagnait.","Sambuc always swore on his father's head that he had put the two good pebbles on his feet. However, the body came back up, the Prussians discovered it three days later, at Pont-Maugis, in tall grass; and their fury was extreme when they had drawn this corpse from the sack, bleeding from the neck like a pig. There were terrible threats, vexations, searches. Undoubtedly, some inhabitants must have talked too much, because one evening they came to arrest the mayor of Remilly and Father Fouchard, guilty of maintaining good relations with the franc-tireurs, whom they accused of having carried out the coup. And Father Fouchard, in this extreme circumstance, was really very handsome, with the impassivity of an old peasant who knew the invincible force of calm and silence. He walked on without being alarmed, without even asking for an explanation. We would see. In the country it was whispered that he had already extracted a large fortune from the Prussians, bags of crowns buried somewhere, one by one, as he earned them.","Sambuc always swore by the head of his father that he really had tied two heavy stones to the feet. Yet the body came up and the Prussians discovered it three days later at Pont-Maugis, caught in the reeds, and their fury was terrible when they found in the sack this dead man who had been bled from the neck like a porker. There were terrible threats, harsh measures, searches of premises. Perhaps some people talked too much, for one evening the mayor of Remilly and old Fouchard were arrested, suspected of having been too friendly with the guerrillas who were being accused of the crime. In this extremity old Fouchard was really very fine, with the imperturbability of an old peasant conscious of the invincible strength of calm and silence. He marched off without any panic, without even asking for an explanation. We should see. It was whispered round about that he had made a large fortune out of the Prussians, sacks of coins buried somewhere, one by one, as he earned them.","In after days Sambuc swore by all that was good and holy he had obeyed the old man's directions, but none the less the corpse came to the surface and was discovered two days afterward by the Prussians among the weeds at Pont-Maugis, and when they saw the manner of their countryman's murder, his throat slit like a pig, their wrath and fury knew no bounds. Their threats were terrible, and were accompanied by domiciliary visits and annoyances of every kind. Some of the villagers must have blabbed, for there came a party one night and arrested Father Fouchard and the Mayor of Remilly on the charge of giving aid and comfort to the francs-tireurs, who were manifestly the perpetrators of the crime. And Father Fouchard really came out very strong under those untoward circumstances, exhibiting all the impassability of a shrewd old peasant, who knew the value of silence and a tranquil demeanor. He went with his captors without the least sign of perturbation, without even asking them for an explanation. The truth would come out. In the country roundabout it was whispered that he had already made an enormous fortune from the Prussians, sacks and sacks of gold pieces, that he buried away somewhere, one by one, as he received them."
"Depuis un moment, les batteries de Saint-Menges faisaient rage, la grêle des projectiles augmentait ; et le capitaine Beaudoin, qui se promenait toujours devant sa compagnie, nerveusement, finit par s’approcher du colonel. C’était une pitié, d’épuiser le moral des hommes, pendant de si longues heures, sans les employer.","For some time the batteries of Saint-Menges had been raging, the hail of projectiles was increasing; and Captain Beaudoin, who was still walking nervously in front of his company, finally approached the colonel. It was a pity to exhaust the morale of the men for such long hours without employing them.","For some little time the batteries on Saint-Menges had been at it like fury, and the hail of shells had got thicker. Captain Beaudoin, still nervously going up and down in front of his company, decided to approach the colonel. It was a pity to wear down the men’s morale for hours and hours without giving them anything to do.","For some little time the batteries at Saint-Menges had been thundering as if determined to surpass all previous efforts, and Captain Beaudoin, who was still tramping nervously up and down before his company line, at last stepped up to the colonel. It was a pity, he said, to waste the men's morale in that way and keep their minds on the stretch for hours and hours."
"– C’est comme j’en connais qui ont parlé de nous faire fusiller, reprit Chouteau menaçant. Des salauds qui nous traitent pire que des bêtes, qui ne comprennent pas que, lorsqu’on a assez du sac et du flingot, aïe donc ! on foute tout ça dans les champs, pour voir s’il en poussera d’autres !… Hein ? les camarades, qu’est-ce qu’ils diraient, ceux-là, si, à cette heure que nous les tenons dans un petit coin, nous les jetions à leur tour sur la voie ?… Ça y est-il, hein ? faut un exemple, pour qu’on ne nous embête plus avec cette sale guerre ! À mort les punaises à Badinguet ! à mort les salauds qui veulent qu’on se batte !","""I know some who have spoken of having us shot,"" continued Chouteau, threateningly. Bastards who treat us worse than animals, who don't understand that when you've had enough of the bag and the gun, ouch! we throw all that in the fields, to see if it will push others!... Huh? comrades, what would they say, if, at this hour that we have them in a little corner, we threw them in their turn on the track?... That's it, huh? we need an example, so that we are no longer bothered with this dirty war! Death to bedbugs in Badinguet! Death to the bastards who want us to fight!","‘I have heard tell of them as talked about shooting us,’ Chouteau went on menacingly. ‘Swine who treat us worse than animals, and don’t realize that when you’ve had enough of your pack and rifle it’s good-bye, you chuck the whole fucking lot into the field to see if some more’ll grow! Well, chums, what would those people say if now we’ve got them in a corner we chucked them out as well on to the railway line? What about it? Must have an example so that they stop tormenting us with this bleeding war! Death to old Badinguet’s lice! Death to the sods who want us to fight!’","“I know some folks who talk of shooting us,” Chouteau continued, with an ugly look at Jean; “dirty, miserable skunks, who treat us worse than beasts, and, when a man's back is broken with the weight of his knapsack and Brownbess, aie! aie! object to his planting them in the fields to see if a new crop will grow from them. What do you suppose they would say, comrades, hein! now that we are masters, if we should pitch them all out upon the track, and teach them better manners? That's the way to do, hein! We'll show 'em that we won't be bothered any longer with their mangy wars. Down with Badinguet's bed-bugs! Death to the curs who want to make us fight!”"

"On ne les avait pas revus, depuis qu’ils s’en étaient allés, sous le prétexte de porter à l’ambulance le sergent Sapin.

Et ils venaient d’échouer là, dans cette auberge mise au pillage.","They had not been seen since they left, under the pretext of taking Sergeant Sapin to the ambulance. No doubt they had wandered afterwards, strolling, avoiding the corners where the shells were falling. And they had just ended up there, in this ransacked inn.",They had not been seen since they had gone off ostensibly to carry Sergeant Sapin to the ambulance post. They had no doubt been wandering about ever since and dodging spots where shells were falling. They had landed up here in this pub which was then being looted.,"Nothing had been seen of the precious pair since they had vanished under pretense of taking Sergeant Sapin into the ambulance. It was sufficiently evident that since then they had been strolling and seeing the sights, taking care to keep out of the way of the shells, until finally they had brought up at this inn that was given over to pillage."
"Il tâtait le pied, le trouvait froid, n’y sentait plus battre le pouls. Son visage était devenu très grave, avec un pli de la lèvre, qui lui était particulier, en face des cas inquiétants.","He felt his foot, found it cold, no longer felt the pulse. His face had become very serious, with a fold of the lip, which was peculiar to him, in front of disturbing cases.","He touched the foot, which was cold, and he could feel no pulse. His face became very grave, with a puckering of the lip that he always had over desperate cases.","He felt the foot and found it cold; the pulse, if any, was so feeble as to be undistinguishable. His face was very grave, and he pursed his lips in a way that was habitual with him when he had a more than usually serious case to deal with."
"Delaherche veilla à ce que le corps, au lieu d’être porté au charnier, fût déposé dans une remise voisine. Il voulait forcer Gilberte, toute bouleversée et pleurante, à se retirer chez elle. Mais elle déclara qu’elle aurait trop peur maintenant, seule, et qu’elle préférait rester avec sa belle-mère, dans l’agitation de l’ambulance, où elle s’étourdissait. Déjà, elle courait donner à boire à un chasseur d’Afrique que la fièvre faisait délirer, elle aidait un infirmier à panser la main d’un petit soldat, une recrue de vingt ans, qui était venu, à pied, du champ de bataille, le pouce emporté ; et, comme il était gentil et drôle, plaisantant sa blessure d’un air insouciant de Parisien farceur, elle finit par s’égayer avec lui.","Delaherche ensured that the body, instead of being taken to the mass grave, was placed in a nearby shed. He wanted to force Gilberte, all upset and weeping, to retire to her room. But she said she would be too scared now, alone, and would rather stay with her mother-in-law, in the hustle and bustle of the ambulance, where she was dazed. She was already running to give a drink to an African hunter delirious with fever, she was helping an orderly to bandage the hand of a little soldier, a twenty-year-old recruit, who had come on foot from the battlefield. , the thumb carried away; and, as he was nice and funny, joking about his injury with the carefree air of a Parisian joker, she ended by having fun with him.","Delaherche saw to it that the body was placed in a near-by coach-house instead of being thrown on to the heap. He tried to force Gilberte, who was weeping uncontrollably, to go indoors. But she said she would be too frightened now to be alone, and preferred to stay with her mother-in-law amid the activity of the ambulance station, which took her mind off things. In a moment she was off to give a drink to a Chasseur d’Afrique who was wandering in delirium, and then she helped an orderly to bandage the hand of a young soldier, a twenty-year-old recruit, who had walked all the way from the battlefield with a thumb off, and as he was nice and funny, joking about his wound with the detached air of a Parisian wag, she even managed to laugh with him.","Delaherche saw to it that the remains, instead of being borne away and placed among the common dead, were deposited in one of the outbuildings of the factory. He endeavored to prevail on Gilberte, who was tearful and disconsolate, to retire to her apartment, but she declared that to be alone now would be more than her nerves could stand, and begged to be allowed to remain with her mother-in-law in the ambulance, where the noise and movement would be a distraction to her. She was seen presently running to carry a drink of water to a chasseur d'Afrique whom his fever had made delirious, and she assisted a hospital steward to dress the hand of a little recruit, a lad of twenty, who had had his thumb shot away and come in on foot from the battlefield; and as he was jolly and amusing, treating his wound with all the levity and nonchalance of the Parisian rollicker, she was soon laughing and joking as merrily as he."
"Cette fois, c’était le salut. Il fit signe à Maurice de le précéder. Celui-ci avait eu la chance de ramasser par terre un parapluie ; et, comme il tombait quelques gouttes d’eau, il l’ouvrit tranquillement, pour traverser la ligne des sentinelles.","This time it was salvation. He motioned to Maurice to precede him. This one had been lucky enough to pick up an umbrella from the ground; and, as a few drops of water were falling, he quietly opened it to cross the line of sentries.","This time it was deliverance. He made signs for Maurice to go on ahead. Maurice had had the good fortune to pick up an umbrella, and as it was spitting with rain he calmly put it up to go through the line of pickets.","Their safety was now assured. He signaled Maurice to go on before. It happened to the latter to discover an umbrella lying on the grass; he picked it up and, as a few drops of rain began to fall just then, opened it tranquilly as they were about to pass the line of sentries."
"– Alors, c’est foutu, pas moyen de passer ! déclara Jean, qui avait habité Paris pendant six mois, au retour de la campagne d’Italie.","– So, it’s screwed, no way to pass! declared Jean, who had lived in Paris for six months on his return from the Italian campaign.","‘So it’s no fucking good that way!’ declared Jean, who had lived for six months in Paris after the Italian campaign.","Besides that, the blazing Tuileries lay directly in their path, and the Louvre, guarded and barricaded, would be an insurmountable obstacle. “That ends it, then; there's no way open,” said Jean, who had spent six months in Paris on his return from the Italian campaign."
"– Allons, murmura-t-elle, viens dormir, mon chéri. Je t’aime bien tout de même, car tu ne sais pas la peine que tu me fais.","- Come on, she whispered, come to sleep, my darling.

"Il partit, rien dès lors ne put l’arrêter. Ce fut d’abord une description de la ferme, un grand bâtiment carré, avec une cour intérieure, fermée par une grille, le tout sur un monticule qui domine Mouzon, à gauche de la route de Carignan. Ensuite, il revint au 12e corps qu’il avait traversé, campé parmi les vignes des coteaux, des troupes superbes, luisantes au soleil, dont la vue l’avait empli d’une grande joie patriotique.","He left, nothing could stop him. It was first a description of the farm, a large square building, with an inner courtyard, closed by a gate, all on a hill overlooking Mouzon, to the left of the road to Carignan. Then he returned to the 12th Corps which he had passed through, encamped among the vines of the hillsides, superb troops, glistening in the sun, the sight of which had filled him with great patriotic joy.","He was off, and nothing could stop him after that. First there was a description of the farmhouse, a large, square building with an inner courtyard, shut off by railings, and standing on a little hill overlooking Mouzon to the left of the Carignan road. Then he came back to the 12th corps that he had gone right through as they were camping among the vines on the slopes – superb troops, gleaming in the sunshine, the sight of whom had filled him with great patriotic joy.","He was fairly started and nothing could stop him. He began by describing the farmhouse, a large structure with an interior court, surrounded by an iron railing, and situated on a gentle eminence overlooking Mouzon, to the left of the Carignan road.

"C’étaient de graves raisons qui venaient de décider le général Douay à une retraite immédiate. La dépêche du sous-préfet de Schelestadt, vieille déjà de trois jours, se trouvait confirmée : on télégraphiait qu’on avait vu de nouveau les feux des Prussiens qui menaçaient Markolsheim ; et, d’autre part, un télégramme annonçait qu’un corps d’armée ennemi passait le Rhin à Huningue. Des détails arrivaient, abondants, précis : la cavalerie et l’artillerie aperçues, les troupes en marche, se rendant de toutes parts à leur point de ralliement. Si l’on s’attardait une heure, c’était sûrement la ligne de retraite sur Belfort coupée. Dans le contre-coup de la défaite, après Wissembourg et Frœschwiller, le général, isolé, perdu à l’avant-garde, n’avait qu’à se replier en hâte ; d’autant plus que les nouvelles, reçues le matin, aggravaient encore celles de la nuit.","These were grave reasons which had just decided General Douay to retire immediately. The despatch from the sub-prefect of Schelestadt, already three days old, was confirmed: it was telegraphed that the fires of the Prussians had again been seen threatening Markolsheim; and, on the other hand, a telegram announced that an enemy army corps was crossing the Rhine at Huningue. Details arrived, abundant, precise: the cavalry and the artillery seen, the troops on the march, going from all sides to their rallying point. If we lingered an hour, it was surely the line of retreat on Belfort cut. In the aftermath of the defeat, after Wissembourg and Frœschwiller, the general, isolated, lost in the vanguard, had only to fall back hastily; the more so as the news received in the morning made even worse that of the night.","General Douay had had serious reasons for deciding on an immediate withdrawal. The dispatch from the sub-prefect of Schlestadt, already three days old, was confirmed, and a telegram said that Prussian camp fires had been sighted again threatening Markolsheim; another telegram said that an enemy corps was crossing the Rhine at Huningue. Details were coming in, full and precise: cavalry and infantry had been sighted, troops on the move from all points and making for their rendezvous. One hour’s delay would mean that the line of retreat on Belfort would certainly be cut. Reacting after the defeat, after Wissembourg and Froeschwiller, the general, isolated and with his advance guard useless, could only fall back at once, especially as the morning’s news was even graver than that of the night before.","There were reasons, of importance that had induced General Douay's determination to retreat immediately. The despatch from the sous-prefet at Schelestadt, now three days old, was confirmed; there were telegrams that the fires of the Prussians, threatening Markolsheim, had again been seen, and again, another telegram informed them that one of the enemy's army corps was crossing the Rhine at Huningue: the intelligence was definite and abundant; cavalry and artillery had been sighted in force, infantry had been seen, hastening from every direction to their point of concentration. Should they wait an hour the enemy would surely be in their rear and retreat on Belfort would be impossible. And now, in the shock consequent on defeat, after Wissembourg and Froeschwiller, the general, feeling himself unsupported in his exposed position at the front, had nothing left to do but fall back in haste, and the more so that what news he had received that morning made the situation look even worse than it had appeared the night before."
"Chaque jour, maintenant, Henriette rentrait de la sorte, bouleversée par quelque agonie, et cette souffrance des autres les rapprochait encore, pendant les tristes heures qu’ils vivaient si seuls, au fond de la grande chambre paisible. Heures bien douces pourtant, car la tendresse était venue, une tendresse qu’ils croyaient fraternelle, entre leurs deux cœurs qui avaient peu à peu appris à se connaître. Lui, d’un esprit si réfléchi, s’était haussé, dans leur intimité continue ; et elle, à le voir bon et raisonnable, ne songeait même plus qu’il était un humble, ayant conduit la charrue avant de porter le sac. Ils s’entendaient très bien, ils faisaient un excellent ménage, comme disait Silvine, avec son sourire grave. Aucune gêne d’ailleurs n’était née entre eux, elle continuait à lui soigner sa jambe, sans que jamais leurs regards clairs se fussent détournés. Toujours en noir, dans ses vêtements de veuve, elle semblait avoir cessé d’être une femme.","Every day now, Henriette came home in this way, overwhelmed by some agony, and this suffering of others brought them even closer, during the sad hours they lived so alone, at the back of the large peaceful room. Very sweet hours, however, because tenderness had come, a tenderness that they believed to be fraternal, between their two hearts which had gradually come to know each other. He, with such a reflective mind, had raised himself, in their continued intimacy; and she, seeing him good and reasonable, no longer even thought that he was humble, having driven the plow before carrying the sack. They got along very well, they made an excellent household, as Silvine said, with her serious smile. Moreover, no embarrassment had arisen between them, she continued to tend to his leg, without their clear eyes ever being diverted. Still in black, in her widow's clothes, she seemed to have ceased to be a woman.","Every day now Henriette came back like this, shattered by some death-scene, and this suffering of others drew the two of them closer still during the weary hours they spent so much alone together in that big, quiet room. Yet they were very beautiful hours for, as they gradually came to know each other, there had developed between their two hearts an affection which they thought was fraternal. His serious mind had risen to new heights during their long intimacy and she, seeing him so good and sensible, forgot that he was a humble man who had followed the plough before becoming a soldier. They understood each other perfectly and made an ideal couple, as Silvine said with her grave smile. Nor had any awkwardness arisen between them, and she went on attending to his leg without ever turning away those candid eyes. Always in her black widow’s weeds, she seemed to have ceased to be a woman.","Never a day passed now but Henriette came in at night in this anguished state, caused by some new death, and the suffering of others had the effect of bringing them together even more closely still during the sorrowful hours that they spent, secluded from all the world, in the silent, tranquil chamber. And yet those hours were full of sweetness, too, for affection, a feeling which they believed to be a brother's and sister's love, had sprung up in those two hearts which little by little had come to know each other's worth. To him, with his observant, thoughtful nature, their long intimacy had proved an elevating influence, while she, noting his unfailing kindness of heart and evenness of temper, had ceased to remember that he was one of the lowly of the earth and had been a tiller of the soil before he became a soldier. Their understanding was perfect; they made a very good couple, as Silvine said with her grave smile. There was never the least embarrassment between them; when she dressed his leg the calm serenity that dwelt in the eyes of both was undisturbed. Always attired in black, in her widow's garments, it seemed almost as if she had ceased to be a woman."
"– Oh ! un enragé ! Jamais il n’a voulu me suivre, et je l’ai lâché, naturellement.","- Oh ! a madman! He never wanted to follow me, and I let him go, of course.","‘Fighting – but why?’ ‘Oh, he’s quite off his head. He simply wouldn’t come with me, so I left him, naturally.’","“He is fighting, you say?—and why?” “He must be out of his head, I think. He would not come with me, and of course I had to leave him.”"
"En chemin, Maurice, sans une parole, saisissant le bras de Jean, l’avait entraîné par un sentier de traverse. Les camarades lui causaient une sorte de dégoût furieux, il venait de faire un projet, celui d’aller coucher dans le petit bois, où il avait passé la première nuit. C’était une bonne idée, que Jean approuva beaucoup, lorsqu’il se fut allongé sur le sol en pente, très sec, abrité par d’épais feuillages. Ils y restèrent jusqu’au grand jour, ils y dormirent même d’un profond sommeil, ce qui leur rendit quelque force.","Along the way, Maurice, without a word, seizing Jean's arm, had led him along a side path. His comrades caused him a kind of furious disgust; he had just made a plan, that of going to sleep in the little wood where he had spent the first night. It was a good idea, which Jean greatly approved of when he lay down on the sloping ground, very dry, sheltered by thick foliage. They remained there until daylight, they even slept there deeply, which gave them back some strength.","On the way Maurice, without a word, had taken Jean’s arm and pulled him down a side path. The others filled him with a kind of furious disgust, and he had made a plan which was to go and sleep in the little copse where he had spent the first night. It was a good idea, and Jean strongly approved of it when he had lain down on sloping ground quite dry and sheltered by dense foliage. They stayed there until broad daylight and even slept a deep sleep which somewhat restored their strength.","On their way back to camp Maurice, without uttering a word, took advantage of the darkness to seize Jean by the arm and drag him into a by-path. Their comrades inspired him with unconquerable disgust; he thought he should like to go and sleep in the little wood where he had spent his first night on the peninsula. It was a good idea, and Jean commended it highly when he had laid himself down on the warm, dry ground, under the shelter of the dense foliage. They remained there until the sun was high in the heavens, and enjoyed a sound, refreshing slumber, which restored to them something of their strength."
"Jean, qui se calmait, proposa les carrières. Elles n’étaient pas à plus de trois cents mètres, il y avait là des trous cachés, où l’on pouvait allumer du feu, sans être vu. Mais, quand ils y furent, toutes sortes de difficultés se présentèrent. D’abord, la question du bois ; et heureusement qu’ils découvrirent la brouette d’un cantonnier, dont Lapoulle fendit les planches, à coups de talon. Ensuite, ce fut l’eau potable qui manquait absolument. Dans la journée, le grand soleil avait séché les petits réservoirs naturels d’eau de pluie. Il existait bien une pompe, mais elle était trop loin, au château de la Tour à Glaire, et l’on y faisait queue jusqu’à minuit, heureux encore lorsqu’un camarade, dans la bousculade, ne renversait pas du coude votre gamelle. Quant aux quelques puits du voisinage, ils étaient taris depuis deux jours, on n’en tirait plus que de la boue. Restait seulement l’eau de la Meuse, dont la berge se trouvait de l’autre côté de la route.","Jean, who was calming down, suggested careers. They were not more than three hundred meters away, there were hidden holes there, where one could light a fire, without being seen. But when they got there, all sorts of difficulties arose. First, the question of wood; and fortunately they discovered a road-mender's wheelbarrow, the planks of which Lapoulle split with his heel. Then it was drinking water that was absolutely lacking. During the day, the strong sun had dried up the small natural reservoirs of rainwater. There was a pump, but it was too far away, at the Château de la Tour à Glaire, and there was a queue there until midnight, still happy when a comrade, in the rush, did not knock over your bowl with his elbow. . As for the few wells in the vicinity, they had been dry for two days, nothing was being drawn from them but mud. There remained only the water of the Meuse, whose bank was on the other side of the road.","Jean, who was beginning to feel better now, suggested the quarries. They weren’t more than three hundred metres away, and there were hidden caves where you could light a fire without being seen. But when they got there all sorts of difficulties cropped up. First there was the question of wood; fortunately they found a quarryman’s wheelbarrow, and Lapoulle kicked the planks apart with his heel. Then there was absolutely no drinking water. During the day the hot sun had dried up the little pools of rainwater. There was a pump, but it was too far away, at the manor of La Tour à Glaire, and you queued there until midnight and thought yourself lucky if, in the scrimmage, some comrade didn’t knock the lot out of your can with his elbow. The little wells in the neighbourhood had been exhausted for two days and you got nothing out of them but mud. That left only the water of the Meuse, and the banks were just across the road.","Jean, who was beginning to recover his self-possession, proposed the quarries. They were only three hundred yards distant, and in them were secret recesses in abundance where they could kindle a fire without being seen. When they reached the spot, however, difficulties of every description presented themselves. First, there was the question of wood; fortunately a laborer, who had been repairing the road, had gone home and left his wheelbarrow behind him; Lapoulle quickly reduced it to fragments with the heel of his boot. Then there was no water to be had that was fit to drink; the hot sunshine had dried up all the pools of rain-water. True there was a pump at the Tour a Glaire, but that was too far away, and besides it was never accessible before midnight; the men forming in long lines with their bowls and porringers, only too happy when, after waiting for hours, they could escape from the jam with their supply of the precious fluid unspilled. As for the few wells in the neighborhood, they had been dry for the last two days, and the bucket brought up nothing save mud and slime. Their sole resource appeared to be the water of the Meuse, which was parted from them by the road."
"– Tonnerre de Dieu ! oui, je me battrais, moi, si j’étais libre… Je ne sais pas si c’est parce qu’ils sont maintenant en maîtres dans mon pays, cette Alsace où les Cosaques avaient déjà fait tant de mal, mais je ne puis penser à eux, les voir en imagination chez nous, dans nos maisons, sans qu’aussitôt une furieuse envie me saisisse d’en saigner une douzaine… Ah ! si je n’avais pas été réformé, si j’étais soldat !","- Thunder of God! yes, I would fight, if I were free... I don't know if it's because they are now masters in my country, this Alsace where the Cossacks had already done so much harm, but I can't to think of them, to see them in my imagination in our homes, without a furious desire immediately seizing me to bleed a dozen of them… Ah! if I had not been reformed, if I were a soldier!","‘God, yes, I’d fight if I was free! I don’t know whether it’s because they are now masters in my own part of the country, in Alsace where already the Cossacks had done so much harm before, but I can’t think of them and visualize them here without at once being seized with a furious desire to make a dozen of them bleed to death… Oh, if I hadn’t been turned down on medical grounds, if I were a soldier!’","“A thousand thunders! I would fight, yes , I would, if they would have me. I don't know whether it is seeing them assume the airs of masters in my country—in this country where once the Cossacks did such mischief; but whenever I think of their being here, of their entering our houses, I am seized with an uncontrollable desire to cut a dozen of their throats. Ah! if it were not for my eyes, if they would take me, I would go!”"
"Dompté, Maurice avait ramassé le fusil. Des larmes de rage lui voilaient les yeux. Il continua sa marche en chancelant comme un homme ivre, au milieu des camarades qui, à présent, ricanaient de ce qu’il avait cédé. Ah ! ce Jean ! il le haïssait d’une inextinguible haine, frappé au cœur de cette leçon si dure, qu’il sentait juste. Et, Chouteau ayant grogné, à son côté, que des caporaux de cette espèce, on attendait un jour de bataille pour leur loger une balle dans la tête, il vit rouge, il se vit nettement cassant le crâne de Jean, derrière un mur.","Tamed, Maurice had picked up the gun. Tears of rage veiled his eyes. He continued his walk, staggering like a drunken man, among the comrades who were now laughing at what he had yielded. Ah! that John! he hated him with an inextinguishable hatred, stricken to the heart by this hard lesson, which he felt was right. And, Chouteau having growled at his side, that corporals of this kind were expected one day of battle to lodge a bullet in their heads, he saw red, he saw himself clearly breaking Jean's skull, behind a wall.","Maurice picked up the gun, thoroughly cowed. There were tears of rage in his eyes. He marched on, staggering like a drunken man, surrounded by his mates who were now jeering because he had knuckled under. Oh, how he hated that Jean with an undying hate, wounded to the quick by such a hard lesson which he felt he deserved. And when Chouteau muttered at his side that with a corporal like that you waited for a battle and then put a bullet through his head, he saw red and had a clear vision of himself bashing Jean’s head in behind some wall.","Maurice was daunted; he stooped and raised the weapon in his hand. Tears of rage stood in his eyes. He reeled like a drunken man as he labored onward, surrounded by his comrades, who now were jeering at him for having yielded. Ah, that Jean! he felt that he should never cease to hate him, cut to the quick as he had been by that bitter lesson, which he could not but acknowledge he had deserved. And when Chouteau, marching at his side, growled: “When corporals are that way, we just wait for a battle and blow a hole in 'em,” the landscape seemed red before his eyes, and he had a distinct vision of himself blowing Jean's brains out from behind a wall."
"Sa parole s’embarrassait, il balbutia encore quelques mots inintelligibles, pendant que la vision de bataille, née de la fièvre, se brouillait peu à peu, emportée dans le sommeil. Il dormait, peut-être continuait-il à rêver la victoire.","His speech became sluggish, he stammered a few more unintelligible words, while the vision of battle, born of fever, gradually blurred, carried away in sleep. He was sleeping, maybe he was still dreaming of victory.","His words were getting mixed up, he mumbled a few more unintelligible words as his vision of the battle, born of a high fever, gradually faded out and vanished into sleep. In his sleep perhaps he was still dreaming of victory.","His speech became more confused as he proceeded; he stammered a few more unintelligible words, while the vision of the battle that had been born of his fever little by little grew blurred and dim and at last was effaced by slumber. He slept, and in his sleep perhaps the honest officer's dreams were dreams of victory."
"– Oui, je savais, Honoré est mort. C’était un très gentil garçon. Seulement, que voulez-vous ? il y en a d’autres qui sont morts, c’est la guerre… Et puis, il me semblait que, du moment où il était mort, il n’y avait plus d’obstacle ; car, enfin, Silvine, laissez-moi vous le rappeler, je n’ai pas été brutal, vous avez consenti…","– Yes, I knew, Honoré is dead. He was a very nice boy. Only, what do you want? there are others who are dead, it's war... And then, it seemed to me that, from the moment he was dead, there was no longer any obstacle; because, finally, Silvine, let me remind you, I was not brutal, you consented...","‘Yes, I knew Honoré was dead. He was a very nice chap. Still, after all, others have been killed, there’s a war on… And then I thought that as he was dead there was no obstacle left between us. Because, as a matter of fact, Silvine, let me remind you, I didn’t use force, you consented…’","“Yes, I heard that Honore was dead; he was a very nice young fellow. But what could you expect? Many another has died as well; it is the fortune of war. And then it seemed to me that once he was dead there would no longer be a barrier between us, and let me remind you, Silvine, that after all I was never brutal toward you—”"
"– C’est notre chance, dit-il de sa voix brève.","""It's our chance,"" he said in his curt voice.","‘Just our luck,’ he snapped.","“It is just our luck,” he curtly said."
"– Trop tard, nom d’un chien !","“Too late, damn it!","‘Too late, dammit!’","“Too late, doggone it!”"
"Jean dormait, et Maurice resta seul. L’idée d’aller rejoindre Lapoulle et les autres, sous la tente, lui causait une lassitude. Il écoutait leurs ronflements répondre à ceux de Rochas, il les jalousait. Peut-être que, si les grands capitaines dorment bien, la veille d’une bataille, c’est simplement qu’ils sont fatigués. Du camp immense, noyé de ténèbres, il n’entendait s’exhaler que cette grosse haleine du sommeil, un souffle énorme et doux. Plus rien n’était, il savait seulement que le 5e corps devait camper par là, sous les remparts, que le 1er s’étendait du bois de la Garenne au village de la Moncelle, tandis que le 12e, de l’autre côté de la ville, occupait Bazeilles ; et tout dormait, la lente palpitation venait des premières aux dernières tentes, du fond vague de l’ombre, à plus d’une lieue. Puis, au delà, c’était un autre inconnu, dont les bruits lui parvenaient aussi par moments, si lointains, si légers, qu’il aurait pu croire à un simple bourdonnement de ses oreilles : galop perdu de cavalerie, roulement affaibli de canons, surtout marche pesante d’hommes, le défilé sur les hauteurs de la noire fourmilière humaine, cet envahissement, cet enveloppement que la nuit elle-même n’avait pu arrêter. Et, là-bas, n’étaient-ce pas encore des feux brusques qui s’éteignaient, des voix éparses jetant des cris, toute une angoisse grandissant, emplissant cette nuit dernière, dans l’attente épouvantée du jour ?","Jean was asleep, and Maurice was left alone. The idea of going to join Lapoulle and the others in the tent made him weary. He listened to their snoring responding to Rochas's, he was jealous of them. Perhaps if great captains sleep well the night before a battle, they are simply tired. From the immense camp, drowned in darkness, he only heard the heavy breath of sleep exhaling, an enormous and soft breath. Nothing was more, he only knew that the 5th corps was to camp there, under the ramparts, that the 1st stretched from the Bois de la Garenne to the village of La Moncelle, while the 12th, on the other side of the town occupied Bazeilles; and everything was asleep, the slow throbbing came from the first to the last tents, from the vague depths of the shadows, more than a league away. Then, beyond, was another stranger, whose sounds also reached him at times, so distant, so light, that he could have believed it to be a simple buzzing in his ears: lost gallop of cavalry, weakened rolling of cannons. , especially the heavy march of men, the procession on the heights of the black human anthill, this invasion, this envelopment that the night itself had been unable to stop. And, over there, weren't those fires still suddenly going out, scattered voices uttering cries, a whole anguish growing, filling this last night, in the terrified expectation of day?","He was, and so Maurice was alone. The thought of joining Lapoulle and the others in the tent made him feel sick and tired. He listened to their snores answering those of Rochas, and felt envious. It may well be that if great captains sleep soundly on the eve of a battle it is simply because they are tired out. Nothing could now be heard coming from the great camp, lost in the darkness, but the heavy breath of sleep, a gigantic but gentle breathing. Nothing really existed clearly, he only knew that the 5th corps must be camping down there beneath the ramparts, that the 1st stretched from the Garenne woods to the village of La Moncelle, while the 12th, over on the other side of the town, was occupying Bazeilles; and everything was asleep, and the slow pulse of sleep was coming from the first tents to the last from the intangible depths of shadow over more than a league. Then beyond all that there was another unknown, and its sound also sometimes reached his ears, so distant, so soft that he might have thought it was just a noise in his own ears – a far away galloping of cavalry, a muffled roar of cannon, but above all a heavy tramp of marching men, the procession up there of the black human ant-hill, the invasion, the enveloping that even night itself could not halt. Were there not somewhere over there fires going out, occasional voices calling, a great and ever growing anguish pervading this last night as they all waited in terror for the day?","Jean was asleep, and Maurice was alone. He could not endure the thought of going to the tent where Lapoulle and the rest of them were slumbering; he heard their snoring, responsive to Rochas' strains, and envied them. If our great captains sleep soundly the night before a battle, it is like enough for the reason that their fatigue will not let them do otherwise. He was conscious of no sound save the equal, deep-drawn breathing of that slumbering multitude, rising from the darkening camp like the gentle respiration of some huge monster; beyond that all was void. He only knew that the 5th corps was close at hand, encamped beneath the rampart, that the 1st's line extended from the wood of la Garenne to la Moncelle, while the 12th was posted on the other side of the city, at Bazeilles; and all were sleeping; the whole length of that long line, from the nearest tent to the most remote, for miles and miles, that low, faint murmur ascended in rhythmic unison from the dark, mysterious bosom of the night. Then outside this circle lay another region, the realm of the unknown, whence also sounds came intermittently to his ears, so vague, so distant, that he scarcely knew whether they were not the throbbings of his own excited pulses; the indistinct trot of cavalry plashing over the low ground, the dull rumble of gun and caisson along the roads, and, still more marked, the heavy tramp of marching men; the gathering on the heights above of that black swarm, engaged in strengthening the meshes of their net, from which night itself had not served to divert them. And below, there by the river's side, was there not the flash of lights suddenly extinguished, was not that the sound of hoarse voices shouting orders, adding to the dread suspense of that long night of terror while waiting for the coming of the dawn?"
"Ce jour-là était encore un dimanche, des volées de cloche venaient de Sedan, tandis qu’on entendait déjà au loin une musique allemande. Mais le 106e n’avait toujours pas d’ordre, et Jean, effrayé du délire croissant de Maurice, se décida à tenter un moyen qu’il mûrissait depuis la veille. Devant le poste prussien, sur la route, un départ se préparait, celui d’un autre régiment, le 5e de ligne. Une grande confusion régnait dans la colonne, dont un officier, parlant mal le français, n’arrivait pas à faire le recensement. Et, tous deux alors, ayant arraché de leur uniforme le collet et les boutons, pour n’être pas trahis par le numéro, filèrent au milieu de la cohue, passèrent le pont, se trouvèrent dehors. Sans doute, Chouteau et Loubet avaient eu la même idée, car ils les aperçurent derrière eux, avec leurs regards inquiets d’assassin.","That day was still a Sunday, peals of bells came from Sedan, while German music could already be heard in the distance. But the 106th still had no orders, and Jean, frightened by Maurice's growing delirium, decided to try a method he had been thinking about since the day before. In front of the Prussian post, on the road, a departure was being prepared, that of another regiment, the 5th of the line. A great confusion reigned in the column, of which an officer, speaking French badly, could not make the census. And then the two of them, having torn the collar and the buttons from their uniforms, so as not to be betrayed by the number, slipped away into the middle of the crowd, crossed the bridge, and found themselves outside. Doubtless Chouteau and Loubet had had the same idea, for they saw them behind them, with their worried assassin's eyes.","It was another Sunday, and peals of bells came from Sedan, and already a German band could be heard in the distance. But still there were no orders for the 106th and Jean, alarmed at Maurice’s increasingly hysterical condition, made up his mind to try a trick he had been meditating since the day before. In the road, in front of the Prussian post, a party was being assembled for leaving, that of another regiment, the 5th infantry. There was considerable confusion in the ranks, and an officer whose French was not much good was having trouble with checking. So both of them, having first pulled the collar band and buttons off their tunics so as not to be given away by the number, slipped into the middle of the crowd, crossed the bridge and found themselves outside. Evidently the same idea had occurred to Chouteau and Loubet, for they saw them behind, with their furtive, murderers’ eyes.","It was Sunday once more; the bells were pealing from the steeples of Sedan, while the music of a German military band floated on the air in the distance. There were still no orders for their regiment to move, and Jean, alarmed to see Maurice's deliriousness increasing, determined to attempt the execution of a plan that he had been maturing in his mind for the last twenty-four hours. On the road before the tents of the Prussians another regiment, the 5th of the line, was drawn up in readiness for departure. Great confusion prevailed in the column, and an officer, whose knowledge of the French language was imperfect, had been unable to complete the roster of the prisoners. Then the two friends, having first torn from their uniform coat the collar and buttons in order that the number might not betray their identity, quietly took their place in the ranks and soon had the satisfaction of crossing the bridge and leaving the chain of sentries behind them. The same idea must have presented itself to Loubet and Chouteau, for they caught sight of them somewhat further to the rear, peering anxiously about them with the guilty eyes of murderers."
"D’un geste, son beau-frère l’arrêta, les mains frémissantes, sa bonne face tout d’un coup bouleversée et pâlie.","With a gesture, his brother-in-law stopped him, his hands quivering, his good face suddenly upset and pale.","His brother-in-law raised a shaking hand to stop him, and his kindly face suddenly looked tired and pale.","His brother-in-law silenced him with a gesture; his hands were trembling with agitation, his kindly pleasant face was pale and bore an expression of deep distress."
"C’était comme pour les trois pains, attachés sur les sacs : on ne l’avait pas écouté, les averses venaient de les détremper, à tel point qu’ils s’étaient fondus, une vraie bouillie, impossible à se mettre sous la dent.","It was like the three loaves, tied to the sacks: we hadn't listened to him, the showers had just soaked them, to such an extent that they had melted, a real mush, impossible to put under the tooth.",And it was just the same over the three loaves that had been tied outside the packs: nobody had listened to him and the rains had soaked them and turned them into a soggy mess you couldn’t bite on at all.,"It was the same with the three loaves that had been fastened outside the knapsacks; they had not listened to his warning, and the consequence was that the rain had soaked the bread and reduced it to paste."
"Lorsque Jean aida Maurice à se hisser dans la carriole, ce dernier se retourna pour le remercier ; et les deux hommes tombèrent aux bras l’un de l’autre, comme s’ils n’avaient jamais dû se revoir. Est-ce qu’on savait, au milieu du branle de la retraite, avec ces Prussiens qui étaient là ? Maurice resta surpris de la grande tendresse qui l’attachait déjà à ce garçon. Et, deux fois encore, il se retourna, pour lui dire au revoir de la main ; et il quitta le camp, où l’on se préparait à allumer de grands feux, afin de tromper l’ennemi, pendant que l’on partirait, dans le plus grand silence, avant la pointe du jour.","When Jean helped Maurice to climb into the cart, the latter turned to thank him; and the two men fell into each other's arms, as if they were never to see each other again. Did anyone know, in the midst of the commotion of the retreat, with those Prussians who were there? Maurice was surprised at the great tenderness which already attached him to this boy. And twice more he turned to wave good-bye; and he left the camp, where they were preparing to light great fires, in order to deceive the enemy, while they were leaving, in the greatest silence, before daybreak.","When Jean helped Maurice up into the trap the latter turned round to thank him and the two men hugged each other as though they were never to see each other again. How could you tell, in all the confusion of retreat, with these Prussians about? Maurice was still surprised at the deep affection that already tied him to this fellow. Twice more he turned round and waved him good-bye, and so he left the camp, where they were preparing to light big fires to deceive the enemy while they slipped off quite noiselessly before dawn.","When Jean assisted Maurice into the carriole the latter turned to thank him, whereon the two men fell into each other's arms and embraced as if they were never to meet again. Who could tell, amid the confusion and disorder of the retreat, with those bloody Prussians on their track? Maurice could not tell how it was that there was already such a tender affection between him and the young man, and twice he turned to wave him a farewell. As he left the camp they were preparing to light great fires in order to mislead the enemy when they should steal away, in deepest silence, before the dawn of day."
– Vous vous aimez bien ?,– Do you like each other?,‘You are very close to each other?’,“You love her very dearly!”
"Et la jeune fille l’accompagna jusqu’à la rue, complaisante, lui jetant encore :","And the young girl accompanied him to the street, complacent, throwing at him again:",The girl obligingly escorted her to the street and threw in by way of a farewell:,"The young girl went with her to the street door, and took leave of her with a courteous:"
"Elle avait détourné la tête, elle regardait la neige de la cour, par la fenêtre, comme résolue à ne pas entendre. Lui, que ce mépris, ce silence obstiné troublaient, interrompit ses explications, pour dire :","She had turned her head away, she was staring at the snow in the yard, through the window, as if resolved not to hear. He, disturbed by this contempt, this obstinate silence, interrupted his explanations to say:","She had turned her head away and was looking through the window at the snow in the yard, as though determined not to hear. He was disconcerted by this silent contempt, and broke off his explanation to say:","She had turned away her head and was looking through the window at the snow that carpeted the courtyard, as if resolved to hear no word he said. Her persistent silence troubled him; he interrupted his explanations to say:"
"– Taisez-vous !… Voici le lieutenant, adressez-vous à lui, si vous avez des observations à faire.","""Be quiet!... Here is the lieutenant, address yourself to him, if you have any observations to make.""","‘Shut up! Here’s the lieutenant, you’d better complain to him if you’ve any remarks to make.’","“Be silent, I say! Here is the lieutenant: address yourself to him if you have anything to say.”"
"Cette fois, Maurice poussa un cri. De nouveau, en trois coups, les batteries prussiennes venaient de rétablir leur tir, et le troisième obus était tombé droit sur la pièce d’Honoré. On vit celui-ci qui se précipitait, qui tâtait d’une main tremblante la blessure fraîche, tout un coin écorné de la bouche de bronze. Mais elle pouvait être chargée encore, la manœuvre reprit, après qu’on eut débarrassé les roues du cadavre d’un autre servant, dont le sang avait éclaboussé l’affût.","This time Maurice let out a cry. Again, in three shots, the Prussian batteries had reestablished their fire, and the third shell had fallen straight on Honoré's piece. We saw him rushing forward, feeling with a trembling hand the fresh wound, a whole chipped corner of his bronze mouth. But it could still be loaded, the operation resumed, after the wheels had been cleared of the corpse of another servant, whose blood had spattered the mounting.","This time Maurice uttered a cry. Once again, in three rounds, the Prussian batteries had readjusted their fire, and the third shell had fallen right on Honoré’s gun. He was seen leaping forward and feeling the fresh damage with a trembling hand – a big piece chipped off the bronze muzzle. But the gun could still be loaded, and the routine went on after they had cleared the wheels of the body of another of the crew, whose blood had splashed on to the gun-carriage.","Maurice uttered a cry of dismay, when, after three attempts, the Prussians had again got their range; the first shell landed squarely on Honore's gun. The artilleryman rushed forward, and with a trembling hand felt to ascertain what damage had been done his pet; a great wedge had been chipped from the bronze muzzle. But it was not disabled, and the work went on as before, after they had removed from beneath the wheels the body of another cannoneer, with whose blood the entire carriage was besplashed."
"– Ah ! tenez, vous, le caporal, prenez tout de même… Dépêchons-nous, à un autre !","– Ah! here, you, corporal, take all the same... Let's hurry, to another one!","‘Oh well, you, the corporal, have some all the same… Hurry up there, next!’","Then, in haste to be done with his task, he changed his mind: “Never mind, though; here, you corporal, take this. Step lively, now. Next man!”"
"Tout, pour lui, depuis qu’il entendait la canonnade, se trouvait effacé : les lenteurs, les incertitudes de la marche, la démoralisation des troupes, le désastre de Beaumont, l’agonie dernière de la retraite forcée sur Sedan. Puisqu’on se battait, est-ce que la victoire n’était pas certaine ? Il n’avait rien appris ni rien oublié, il gardait son mépris fanfaron de l’ennemi, son ignorance absolue des conditions nouvelles de la guerre, son obstinée certitude qu’un vieux soldat d’Afrique, de Crimée et d’Italie ne pouvait pas être battu. Ce serait vraiment trop drôle, de commencer à son âge !","Everything, for him, since he heard the cannonade, was erased: the slowness, the uncertainties of the march, the demoralization of the troops, the disaster at Beaumont, the final agony of the forced retreat on Sedan. Since we were fighting, wasn't victory certain? He had learned nothing and forgotten nothing, he retained his boastful contempt for the enemy, his absolute ignorance of the new conditions of war, his stubborn certainty that an old soldier from Africa, Crimea and Italy could not not be beaten. It would be really too funny, to start at his age!","For him, since he had heard the gunfire, everything else was wiped out: the delays, lack of direction on the march, demoralization of the troops, the disaster at Beaumont, the final agony of the forced retreat on Sedan. But since they were actually fighting, wasn’t victory certain? He had learned nothing and forgotten nothing, and he kept his swaggering contempt for the enemy, his total ignorance of modern conditions of warfare, his obstinate certainty that a veteran of Africa, the Crimea and Italy was unbeatable. It really would be too silly to start again at his age!","All the trials and troubles of the past were to him as if they had not been, now that his ears were gladdened by the roar of the guns: the delays and conflicting orders of the chiefs, the demoralization of the troops, the stampede at Beaumont, the distress of the recent forced retreat on Sedan—all were forgotten. Now that they were about to fight at last, was not victory certain? He had learned nothing and forgotten nothing; his blustering, boastful contempt of the enemy, his entire ignorance of the new arts and appliances of war, his rooted conviction that an old soldier of Africa, Italy, and the Crimea could by no possibility be beaten, had suffered no change. It was really a little too comical that a man at his age should take the back track and begin at the beginning again!"
"– Écoute, dit-il tout bas à Jean, qui marchait près de lui, nous allons attendre de passer le long d’un bois, et d’un saut nous filerons parmi les arbres… La frontière belge n’est pas loin, nous trouverons bien quelqu’un pour nous y conduire.","“Listen,” he said softly to Jean, who was walking near him, “we're going to wait to pass along a wood, and with a hop we'll spin through the trees… The Belgian border is not far, we we'll find someone to take us there.","‘Look here,’ he whispered to Jean who was walking at his side, ‘we’ll wait until we’re going past some wood and then jump into the trees. The Belgian frontier isn’t far away, and we are sure to find someone to take us there.’","“Listen,” he said below his breath to Jean, who was walking at his side; “we will wait until we come to a wood; then we'll break through the guards and run for it among the trees. The Belgian frontier is not far away; we shall have no trouble in finding someone to guide us to it.”"

"Weiss, dès huit heures, s’était trouvé enfermé là, séparé des troupes qui se repliaient. Tout de suite, le retour à Sedan était devenu impossible, car les Bavarois, débordant par le parc de Montivilliers, avaient coupé la ligne de retraite. Il était seul, avec son fusil et les cartouches qui lui restaient, lorsqu’il aperçut devant sa porte une dizaine de soldats, demeurés comme lui en arrière, isolés de leurs camarades, cherchant des yeux un abri, pour vendre au moins chèrement leur peau. Vivement, il descendit leur ouvrir, et la maison dès lors eut une garnison, un capitaine, un caporal, huit hommes, tous hors d’eux, enragés, résolus à ne pas se rendre.","Weiss, at eight o'clock, had found himself locked up there, separated from the troops which were falling back. Immediately the return to Sedan had become impossible, for the Bavarians, overrunning by the park of Montivilliers, had cut the line of retreat. He was alone, with his rifle and the cartridges he had left, when he saw in front of his door a dozen soldiers, who had remained behind like him, isolated from their comrades, looking for shelter with their eyes, to sell their skins at least dearly. . Hastily he descended to open the door to them, and the house now had a garrison, a captain, a corporal, eight men, all beside themselves, enraged, resolved not to surrender.","Weiss had been marooned there since eight in the morning, cut off from the withdrawing troops. Suddenly his return to Sedan had become impossible, for the Bavarians, who had come out through the park of Montvillers, had cut the line of retreat. He was alone with his gun and the remaining rounds of ammunition, when he saw ten soldiers in front of his door who like him had been left behind, isolated from their comrades, and they were looking round for some shelter where they could at least sell their lives as dearly as possible. He at once ran downstairs and opened the door to them, and from then on the house had a garrison, a captain, a corporal and eight men, all in a fury of desperation and determined never to surrender.","Ever since eight o'clock Weiss, abandoned by the retiring troops, had been a self-made prisoner there. His return to Sedan had become an impossibility, for the Bavarians, immediately upon the withdrawal of the French, had swarmed down from the park of Montivilliers and occupied the road. He was alone and defenseless, save for his musket and what few cartridges were left him, when he beheld before his door a little band of soldiers, ten in number, abandoned, like himself, and parted from their comrades, looking about them for a place where they might defend themselves and sell their lives dearly. He ran downstairs to admit them, and thenceforth the house had a garrison, a lieutenant, corporal and eight men, all bitterly inflamed against the enemy, and resolved never to surrender."

"Et, tout éclopé qu’il était, les cheveux collés encore par le sang de son éraflure, il se redressa, dans un besoin vivace de vivre, de reprendre l’outil ou la charrue, pour rebâtir la maison, selon sa parole. Il était du vieux sol obstiné et sage, du pays de la raison, du travail et de l’épargne.","And, crippled as he was, his hair still sticky with the blood from his scrape, he straightened up, in a vivid need to live, to take up the tool or the plow again, to rebuild the house, according to his word. He was from the stubborn and wise old soil, from the land of reason, work and thrift.","And, although he was wounded, his hair still matted with blood from the graze, he struggled up in an unquenchable urge to live, to handle a tool or a plough and rebuild his house, as he put it. He came from the old, unchanging, careful soil, from the land of reason, hard work and savings.","And notwithstanding his seedy condition and demoralized appearance, his hair all matted and pasted to his head by the blood that had flowed from his wound, he drew himself up defiantly, animated by a keen desire to live, to take up the tools of his trade or put his hand to the plow, in order, to use his own expression, to “rebuild the house.” He was of the old soil where reason and obstinacy grow side by side, of the land of toil and thrift."

"On ne répondit pas. Il menaça de tirer, répétant sa question. Alors, une voix haletante, oppressée, parvint à dire :","We did not answer. He threatened to shoot, repeating his question. Then a breathless, oppressed voice managed to say:","No answer. He threatened to fire and repeated his question. Then a breathless, scared voice managed to say:","There was no reply.

"Puis, à l’est, il y avait l’autre branche de l’étau. S’il apercevait, au nord, du plateau d’Illy à celui de Floing, la ligne de bataille du 7e corps, mal soutenu par le 5e, qu’on avait placé en réserve sous les remparts, il lui était impossible de savoir ce qui se passait à l’est, le long de la vallée de la Givonne, où le 1er corps se trouvait rangé, du bois de la Garenne au village de Daigny. Mais le canon tonnait aussi de ce côté, la lutte devait être engagée dans le bois Chevalier, en avant du village. Et son inquiétude venait de ce que des paysans avaient signalé, dès la veille, l’arrivée des Prussiens à Francheval ; de sorte que le mouvement qui se produisait à l’ouest, par Donchery, avait lieu également à l’est, par Francheval, et que les mâchoires de l’étau réussiraient à se rejoindre, là-bas, au nord, au calvaire d’Illy, si la double marche d’enveloppement n’était pas arrêtée. Il ne savait rien en science militaire, il n’avait que son bon sens, et il tremblait, à voir cet immense triangle dont la Meuse faisait un des côtés, et dont les deux autres étaient représentés, au nord, par le 7e corps, à l’est, par le 1er, tandis que le 12e, au sud, à Bazeilles, occupait l’angle extrême, tous les trois se tournant le dos, attendant on ne savait pourquoi ni comment un ennemi qui arrivait de toutes parts. Au milieu, comme au fond d’une basse-fosse, la ville de Sedan était là, armée de canons hors d’usage, sans munitions et sans vivres.","Then, to the east, there was the other branch of the vise. If he saw, to the north, from the plateau of Illy to that of Floing, the line of battle of the 7th corps, badly supported by the 5th, which had been placed in reserve under the ramparts, it was impossible for him to know what which was happening to the east, along the valley of the Givonne, where the 1st Corps was ranged, from the Bois de la Garenne to the village of Daigny. But the cannon also thundered from that side, the fight was to be engaged in the Bois Chevalier, in front of the village. And his uneasiness arose from the fact that the peasants had signaled, the day before, the arrival of the Prussians at Franccheval; so that the movement which took place in the west, by Donchery, also took place in the east, by Franccheval, and that the jaws of the vice would succeed in joining, over there, in the north, at the Calvary of 'Illy, if the double wrap march wasn't stopped. He knew nothing of military science, he had only his common sense, and he trembled to see this immense triangle of which the Meuse formed one of the sides, and of which the two others were represented, to the north, by the 7th corps, to the east, by the 1st, while the 12th, to the south, at Bazeilles, occupied the extreme angle, all three turned their backs, waiting, no one knew why or how, for an enemy arriving from all sides. In the middle, as if at the bottom of a ditch, was the town of Sedan, armed with out-of-use cannons, without ammunition and without provisions.","Then eastwards there was the other jaw of the vice. Although he could see to the north, from the plateau of Illy to that of Floing, the whole battle-line of the 7th corps, supported in a feeble way by the 5th, which had been stationed in reserve beneath the ramparts, he could not know what was going on further east along the valley of the Givonne, where the 1st corps was stretched from the Garenne woods to the village of Daigny. But guns were roaring in that direction as well, and the battle must be joined in the Chevalier wood at this end of the village. His disquiet came from the fact that some country folk had said the day before that the Prussians had reached Francheval, so that the movement going on in the west via Donchery was also happening in the east via Francheval, and the jaws of the vice would succeed in meeting over in the north at the Calvary of Illy if the double pincer movement was not halted. He knew nothing about military science, had nothing but his own common sense, and he shuddered as he contemplated this immense triangle, one side of which was the Meuse and the two others were made up by the 7th corps on the north and the 1st on the east, while the 12th occupied the extreme point on the south, and all three had their backs to the others, waiting, God knew how or why, for an enemy coming from all directions. In the middle, at the bottom of a pit, was the town of Sedan, armed with obsolete cannon, with neither munitions nor provisions.","And off to the eastward the other arm of the powerful vise was slowly closing in on them. Casting his eyes to the north, where there was a stretch of level ground between the plateaus of Illy and of Floing, he could make out the line of battle of the 7th corps, feebly supported by the 5th, which was posted in reserve under the ramparts of the city; but he could not discern what was occurring to the east, along the valley of the Givonne, where the 1st corps was stationed, its line stretching from the wood of la Garenne to Daigny village. Now, however, the guns were beginning to thunder in that direction also; the conflict seemed to be raging in Chevalier's wood, in front of Daigny. His uneasiness was owing to reports that had been brought in by peasants the day previous, that the Prussian advance had reached Francheval, so that the movement which was being conducted at the west, by way of Donchery, was also in process of execution at the east, by way of Francheval, and the two jaws of the vise would come together up there at the north, near the Calvary of Illy, unless the two-fold flanking movement could be promptly checked. He knew nothing of tactics or strategy, had nothing but his common sense to guide him; but he looked with fear and trembling on that great triangle that had the Meuse for one of its sides, and for the other two the 7th and 1st corps on the north and east respectively, while the extreme angle at the south was occupied by the 12th at Bazeilles—all the three corps facing outward on the periphery of a semicircle, awaiting the appearance of an enemy who was to deliver his attack at some one point, where or when no one could say, but who, instead, fell on them from every direction at once. And at the very center of all, as at the bottom of a pit, lay the city of Sedan, her ramparts furnished with antiquated guns, destitute of ammunition and provisions."
"Jean les laissa rire. On n’allait peut-être plus en trouver si souvent l’occasion ; et lui, avec son air de gros garçon sérieux, à la figure pleine et régulière, n’était pourtant pas pour la mélancolie, fermant les yeux volontiers quand ses hommes prenaient du plaisir. Mais un autre groupe l’occupa, un soldat de son escouade encore, Maurice Levasseur, en train, depuis une heure bientôt, de causer avec un civil, un monsieur roux d’environ trente-six ans, une face de bon chien, éclairée de deux gros yeux bleus à fleur de tête, des yeux de myope qui l’avaient fait réformer. Un artilleur de la réserve, maréchal des logis, l’air crâne et d’aplomb avec ses moustaches et sa barbiche brunes, était venu les rejoindre ; et tous les trois s’oubliaient là, comme en famille.","Jean let them laugh. Perhaps the occasion was no longer to be found so often; and he, with his air of a serious big boy, with a full and regular face, was not, however, for melancholy, closing his eyes willingly when his men took pleasure. But another group occupied it, a soldier from his squad again, Maurice Levasseur, who had been chatting with a civilian for almost an hour, a red-haired gentleman of about thirty-six, the face of a good dog, enlightened two big blue eyes protruding from the head, myopic eyes which had had him reformed. An artilleryman from the reserve, quartermaster, with a cocky and self-assured air with his brown mustache and goatee, had come to join them; and all three forgot themselves there, as if in family.","Jean let them laugh. There might not be many more chances, and for all the serious look of the man, with his full face and regular features, he wasn’t in favour of melancholy and deliberately shut his eyes when the men had their bit of fun. But another group caught his attention, yet another soldier in his squad, Maurice Levasseur, who had been talking for the last hour to a civilian, a red-haired gentleman of about thirty-six, with a face like a good-natured dog, with huge blue popping eyes – the short-sighted eyes that had got him exempted from military service. They had been joined by a reserve artilleryman, a sergeant, smart and self-assured with his dark moustache and goatee beard, and all three were chatting away quite oblivious of time as though they were at home.","Jean did not interfere to check their merriment. Perhaps the time was at hand when they would not have much occasion for laughter, and he, with all his seriousness and his humdrum, literal way of taking things, did not consider that it was part of his duty to be melancholy, preferring rather to close his eyes or look the other way when his men were enjoying themselves. But his attention was attracted to a second group not far away, another soldier of his squad, Maurice Levasseur, who had been conversing earnestly for near an hour with a civilian, a red-haired gentleman who was apparently about thirty-six years old, with an intelligent, honest face, illuminated by a pair of big protruding blue eyes, evidently the eyes of a near-sighted man. They had been joined by an artilleryman, a quartermaster-sergeant from the reserves, a knowing, self-satisfied-looking person with brown mustache and imperial, and the three stood talking like old friends, unmindful of what was going on about them."
"Et madame Delaherche, la mère, s’était enfermée avec lui, dès le lendemain de l’occupation. Sans doute ils avaient dû s’entendre, en quelques mots, une fois pour toutes, sur leur formel désir de se cloîtrer ensemble au fond de cette pièce, tant que des Prussiens logeraient dans la maison. Beaucoup y avaient passé deux ou trois nuits, un capitaine, M. de Gartlauben, y couchait encore, à demeure. Du reste, jamais plus ni le colonel ni la vieille dame n’avaient reparlé de ces choses. Malgré ses soixante-dix-huit ans, elle se levait dès l’aube, venait s’installer dans un fauteuil, en face de son ami, à l’autre coin de la cheminée ; et, sous la lumière immobile de la lampe, elle se mettait à tricoter des bas pour les petits pauvres, tandis que lui, les yeux fixés sur les tisons, ne faisait jamais rien, ne semblait vivre et mourir que d’une pensée, dans une stupeur croissante. Ils n’échangeaient sûrement pas vingt paroles en une journée, il l’avait arrêtée du geste, chaque fois que, sans le vouloir, elle qui allait et venait par la maison, laissait échapper quelque nouvelle du dehors ; de sorte que désormais, il ne pénétrait plus rien là de la vie extérieure, et que rien n’était entré du siège de Paris, des défaites de la Loire, des quotidiennes douleurs de l’invasion. Mais, dans cette tombe volontaire, le colonel avait beau refuser la lumière du jour, se boucher les deux oreilles, tout l’effroyable désastre, tout le deuil mortel devait lui arriver par les fentes, avec l’air qu’il respirait ; car, d’heure en heure, il était comme empoisonné quand même, il se mourait davantage.","And Madame Delaherche, the mother, had locked herself up with him the day after the occupation. No doubt they must have agreed, in a few words, once and for all, on their formal desire to shut themselves up together at the back of this room, as long as Prussians were staying in the house. Many had spent two or three nights there, a captain, M. de Gartlauben, still slept there permanently. Besides, neither the colonel nor the old lady had ever spoken of these things again. In spite of her seventy-eight years, she got up at dawn, came and settled down in an armchair, opposite her friend, at the other corner of the fireplace; and, under the motionless light of the lamp, she began to knit stockings for the little poor, while he, his eyes fixed on the embers, never did anything, seemed to live and die only from a thought, in growing stupor. They certainly did not exchange twenty words in a day, he had stopped her with a gesture each time, unwittingly, she, who came and went through the house, let slip some news from outside; so that henceforth nothing of external life penetrated there, and nothing had entered of the siege of Paris, of the defeats of the Loire, of the daily pains of the invasion. But, in this voluntary tomb, the colonel refused the light of day in vain, blocked his two ears, all the frightful disaster, all the mortal mourning had to come to him through the cracks, with the air he breathed; for, from hour to hour, he was as if poisoned all the same, he was dying more.","Old Madame Delaherche had shut herself up with him on the day after the occupation. They had no doubt come to an understanding, in a few words and once and for all, about their definite wish to remain cloistered together in this room so long as there were Prussians billeted in the house. Many had spent only two or three nights there, but one, Captain von Gartlauben, was there permanently. However, neither the colonel nor the old lady had ever referred to these things again. For all her seventy-eight years she rose at dawn and came and took up her position in an armchair opposite her friend on the other side of the fireplace, and in the unchanging light of the lamp she began knitting stockings for poor children, while he, staring into the wood fire, never did anything, and seemed to be living and dying with but one thought, in a growing lethargy. They certainly did not exchange twenty words in a whole day, and if at any time, simply because she came and went about the house, she inadvertently let some item of outside news escape her, he always stopped her with a gesture. So now nothing whatever came in from life outside, nothing about the siege of Paris, the defeats on the Loire, the daily sufferings of the invasion. But however much, in this voluntary entombment, he refused to see the light of day and stuffed up his ears, the whole appalling disaster and mortal grief must have been reaching him through the cracks, in the air he breathed; for hour by hour he was none the less poisoned by these things and brought nearer to death.","Delaherche, the mother, had immured herself there with him on the day succeeding the occupation. No doubt they understood each other, and had expressed in two words, once for all, their common purpose to seclude themselves in that apartment so long as there should be Prussians quartered in the house. They had afforded compulsory hospitality to many of the enemy for various lengths of time; one, a Captain, M. Gartlauben, was there still, had taken up his abode with them permanently. But never since that first day had mention of those things passed the colonel's and the old lady's lips. Notwithstanding her seventy-eight years she was up every morning soon as it was day and came and took her position in the fauteuil that was awaiting her in the chimney nook opposite her old friend. There, by the steady, tranquil lamplight, she applied herself industriously to knitting socks for the children of the poor, while he, his eyes fixed on the crumbling brands, with no occupation for body or mind, was as one already dead, in a state of constantly increasing stupor. They certainly did not exchange twenty words in the course of a day; whenever she, who still continued to go about the house at intervals, involuntarily allowed some bit of news from the outer world to escape her lips, he silenced her with a gesture, so that no tidings of the siege of Paris, the disasters on the Loire and all the daily renewed horrors of the invasion had gained admission there. But the colonel might stop his ears and shut out the light of day as he would in his self-appointed tomb; the air he breathed must have brought him through key-hole and crevices intelligence of the calamity that was everywhere throughout the land, for every new day beheld him sinking, slowly dying, despite his determination not to know the evil news."
"Les vastes étendues de terre crayeuse continuaient, se succédaient sans fin. Pas une ferme, pas une âme, rien que des vols de corbeaux tachant de noir l’immensité grise. À gauche, très loin, des bois de pin, d’une verdure sombre, couronnaient les lentes ondulations qui bornaient le ciel ; tandis que, sur la droite, on devinait le cours de la Vesle, à une ligne d’arbres continue. Et là, derrière les coteaux, on voyait, depuis une lieue, monter une fumée énorme, dont les flots amassés finissaient par barrer l’horizon d’une effrayante nuée d’incendie.","The vast expanses of chalky land continued, followed each other endlessly. Not a farm, not a soul, nothing but flocks of crows staining the gray immensity with black. To the left, very far away, pine woods, of dark greenery, crowned the slow undulations which bounded the sky; while, on the right, the course of the Vesle could be guessed from a continuous line of trees. And there, behind the hills, one could see, for a league, an enormous smoke rising, the gathered waves of which ended by blocking the horizon with a frightful cloud of fire.","The vast stretches of chalky earth went on and on without end. Never a farm, never a soul, nothing but flights of rooks like specks of black on the grey immensity. Far away to the left some pine woods, almost black, crowned the gentle undulations where the sky began, while to the right the course of the Vesle could be made out by an unbroken line of trees. And in that direction, behind the hills, they had seen for the last league a huge amount of smoke going up in billows that finally united to blot out the horizon with a terrifying cloud of fire.","Broad expanses of chalky ground of a dirty white lay before and around them, and seemed to have no end. Not a farmhouse to be seen anywhere, not a living being; nothing but flocks of crows, forming small spots of blackness on the immensity of the gray waste. On the left, far away in the distance, the low hills that bounded the horizon in that direction were crowned by woods of somber pines, while on the right an unbroken wall of trees indicated the course of the river Vesle. But over there behind the hills they had seen for the last hour a dense smoke was rising, the heavy clouds of which obscured the sky and told of a dreadful conflagration raging at no great distance."
